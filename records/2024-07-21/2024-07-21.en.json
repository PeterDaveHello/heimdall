    "originBody": "Introduction Butts Are Difficult On this page Butts Are Difficult \"… Society has put a lot of evils in our brains that we need to transcend before we make out.\" Cex - Not Trying No, really. For as much fun as butts and their surrounding body parts can be, applying technology to them is just a nightmare of conflicting issues and requirements and considerations that's absolutely exhausting to think about for too long. So I'll try to keep this short. Before we delve into what Buttplug is from the technical side, I'd like to take a minute to think about it from the social and ethical side. It's impossible to solve everything that may come up when using this library in a single page of a developer guide (it'd still be a tall order at a million pages. Thank Turing and his infernal machines for that), but I can at least go over a few things to think about while developing sex tech apps, other than whether your threads are deadlocking or memory is leaking. Empathy for the User Having Sex With Your Software Let's start with the user of the software you're about to create. When working on Buttplug applications, something that should be at the forefront of your design thinking is: Someone is going to fuck this. The context of this usage should influence all levels of design, from UI/UX to low level code decisions. Assuming the user will approach a piece of software that involves Buttplug in the same way they would, say, a word processor, will end up in a fuckable word processor. If that's what you were aiming for, great, but otherwise this will just end up in a frustrated user and something that looked like a cat walked across the keyboard. As you build projects using Buttplug, ask yourself questions that the user will encounter: Could I use this while turned on? If I'm REALLY turned on, how long does it take for me to go from \"I wanna use this\" to \"I am using this\"? What happens if my hardware disconnects? Do I have a quick way to stop whatever the hardware may be doing? Can I control this while possibly covered in [lube or other things]? Since Buttplug programs are meant to be sexual, there's a good chance the user won't be considering these questions before embarking on whatever technical adventure you've implemented for them. Therefore it's your job to think about these issues first. Github After Dark Developing sex software isn't a practice with much best practices or documented history or even a community of developers willing to admit they'd do such a thing. While we hope to change all of those with this library, that's going to take time. In order to gain acceptance in larger software communities, we hope to share our code in public forums, such as GitHub. These hopes have to be tempered by the issues of the general sterility of software, though. GitHub, StackOverflow, Glitch, and other community sites were not really made with NSFW content in mind. While there are certainly \"adult\" projects on GitHub in the form of porn site scrapers, adult games, and other applications, it's still not the norm by any means. How you present your sex software project as the community grows could end up setting standards for how services deal with NSFW code projects in the future. Most of the code in Buttplug library isn't extremely explicit, but applications implementing Buttplug may be. Be careful with anything involving media assets that may be deemed inappropriate for certain age groups, especially on sites that don't allow search removal or age checking. Self hosting is always an option for projects involving sensitive materials. If you would like to use a project site for Buttplug work, and they don't have an obvious policy stating how they might feel about their site being used with sensitive materials, it may be in your best interest to contact them. If you don't feeling comfortable handling this yourself, feel free to file an issue on the main Buttplug repo and we'll be happy to reach out and discuss. The Core Buttplug Developer Team has communicated with services in the past to figure out best practices for hosting sensitive code content, and the outcomes are usually positive. Additionally, we highly recommend that any open source or community project using Buttplug should also have a Code of Conduct. While there have been many lively discussions on projects like databases and kernels adopting CoCs, there are some very concrete contextual reasons to have them for sex software projects. This rings especially true if it is a project that may involve some sort of generic, multiple-community/interest use. For instance, let's say someone is writing an audio player/movie player that controls sex toys with Buttplug. A massive variety of media could be fed into this application, and there is a good chance that media used by some users may be found offensive by others. These user groups will still need support, and may possibly be sharing the same issue/bug tracker for their needs. Having a CoC in place guides moderation of situations where interests may conflict. As for which CoC to use (if looking for a prewritten one), you can check out ours as an example. It's really just a slightly modified version of the Contributor's Covenant. Using stock CoC's on sex software projects can prove difficult due to rules about \"appropriate wording\", due to the sexually explicit context of the project itself. Addendums or rewording may be required, though we do recommend being cautious in how these are presented. We welcome discussion of these issues on our message boards or discord server. Finally, you should consider if and how you'll handle contributions to your project. Regardless of whether you're running the project under your own identity, through a pseudonym, or anonymously, you shouldn't expect your contributors to all make the same choice as you did. Be ready to consider situations where someone wants to contribute but may need to use an anonymous account to do so, or may want to use their real and/or well-known identity, and how that may affect the optics and upkeep of your project. Mistakes Will Be Made Now that we've covered users and services, let's focus on you, the developer. The theme here will be as it was in the other sections: Plan ahead. Making a mistake that ends in something like data loss or crashing programs is one thing, but with sex software, there's just as likely to be social/ethical problems around technically competent implementations. How you respond to these problems affects not only your project, but the field of sex tech in general. Isn't responsibility fun? This might seem like putting way too much burden on someone making a tiny vibrator app with a new interface, but context outweights technology here. Technology as applied to sex means people will concentrate on the sex more than the technology when discussing the topic. This is why security breaches in commercial sex tech seem extra bad, even if they may impact far fewer users than a large, non-sex related technical service being hacked. As it goes with larger companies, so it will go with smaller projects. A small project that makes some sort of mistake around sex tech may still see more fire than, say, someone's reimplementation of an algorithm or database or something. Social context matters. Does this means you shouldn't develop for sex tech? Absolutely not. It just means you should treat it with more caution and planning than you might normally for less \"interesting\" software projects (and for everyone thinking \"but most software is devoid of usage context and could be perverted for whatever reason!\", yes I get it but I want to keep this section short, remember? So just go with it here.). As you'd think your design through for your users based on the criteria from the first section of this section, think your design through for yourself too. What is it you want to be responsible for with the software you're releasing? What do and don't you want your users to be able to do with it? Note that this list is malleable. You don't have to get it right the first time, and it doesn't need to be formally stated for most smaller projects. It can grow and change as your software grows and changes, but having the stated requirements will help both you and your users in case things ever \"blow up\". The Buttplug Mission Statement Buttplug isn't a \"smaller\" project though, so we do get to take on the formal statement. For Buttplug as a project, it felt best to sum up all of the information in this section as The Buttplug Mission Statement (written by someone far smarter than me after I said it far more verbosely and with a bunch of handwaving and probably some cursing). Buttplug is committed to the safety, autonomy, and human rights of people using it as a sex technology standard, and stands in solidarity with the many intersectional rights of all individuals to be sex positive. As such, Buttplug encourages individual empowerment through self-directed education, and responsible behaviors which are also respectful of the needs and the choices available to everyone. Getting the paragraphs in this section (plus a bunch of stuff not covered) squeezed into an almost-tweetable chunk means using dense wording that may sound odd for a project named \"Buttplug\", but this is a Load Bearing Mission Statement. It has a lot to explain and contextualize in a small space, and it does what the project needs. As your project may be more specific than \"abstract hardware controller\", odds are you may not need something of this manner, but it's good to at least think about what you'd say to sum up what it is you're doing and why you're doing it, before you actually have to do so. Mo' Butts Mo' Problems This section, at best, should provide a framework about how to think about things as you develop your application. Your experience will be unique, and may require you to come up with your own strategies to continue development and distribution in a way that works for you and/or your community. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out via the contact info on the home page of this document! I'd love to hear about how developers create and adapt tech as they need for their users.",

Hi, I'm qdot, founder of buttplug.io and author of Butts Are Difficult, the ethics page in the buttplug.io docs. I also wrote the rest of the buttplug.io docs but this is the part that I'm proudest of, both because I was really happy how it turned out and also because unlike the parts of the docs involving the API, this one doesn't go out of date as quickly. Ask me anything! reply errantspark 52 minutes agoparentI tried to use buttplug years ago but I found it to be difficult to work with and introduce too much latency into play. My partner and I have replaced it with 37 lines of javascript that give us more realtime control of our toys (albeit only Lovense, by just spamming .writeValueWithoutResponse()). I'm curious what your background is that you approached the problem in the way that you did? I appreciate that you're covering all the edge cases for a lot of different toys, but it also really feels like you use 1000 lines of code where 10 will do. reply qdot76367 29 minutes agorootparent> it also really feels like you use 1000 lines of code where 10 will do. Ok. Let's break this down. The library currently handles support for 523 different devices from at least 40-50 manufacturers. (https://iostindex.com/?filter0Availability=Available,DIY&fil...). These devices can connect over bluetooth le, usb (both raw and HID), serial, or one of several network protocols. We support windows, mac, linux, android, iOS, and WASM/web, each having their own HW APIs (or in the case of the mac/iOS crossover, specializations within the API). On several of these platforms there are also massive variations in bluetooth radios, which can cause a huge array of issues. Each device may have variable actuators, or may also have sensors to take input. They may also require their own keepalives or other specializations specific to their protocol or brand to manage connections. We then have to generalize commands to make life easier on developers. They send us those generalized commands, from whatever language they like since we abstract into an IPC system and provide a language-agnostic protocol spec, from whatever interconnect they want to use because our connector system is also violently flexible, and we have to convert them into the correct protocol and ship that over the correct bus. So, since you're curious about why your solution for one device from one brand running through a web browser differs from my library, there you go. It's just a matter of different goals. Now, if you can do all that in 10 lines, fantastic, I look forward to your library as competition in the future. :3 While I'm glad you've found a solution that works for your case, I can't tell you why you were seeing latency in our library that wasn't also in the browser. I'm well aware of the JS-to-IPC-to-hardware chain in the browser (I'm the ex-device interfaces lead on firefox, worked with some of the chrome engineers on the development of the hardware focused WebAPIs too) and it's even more complicated than ours. reply qdot76367 22 minutes agorootparentAlso, if you're curious about web focused solutions to these issues, this is the perfect time to bring up a friend of our project, XToys: https://xtoys.app. It's a fully web based (though closed source) toy control application that supports about as many devices as I do, plus a bunch of others that I don't, and has Blockly scripting and WebRTC for remote sessions. It's neat as hell. reply bozey07 11 hours agoparentprev>If I'm REALLY turned on, how long does it take for me to go from \"I wanna use this\" to \"I am using this\"? I'm glad this is a concern.

Bluetooth is hardly stable for me. reply wantoncl 2 hours agorootparentprev> You are either speaking hyperbolicly or lying. Bluetooth is very stable these days. Bluetooth as a network protocol, that might be stable. Bluetooth interactivity is not stable or even usable in many cases. It's not just in cars and other non-computer interfaces, good luck trying to pair a non-Apple device with an Apple device. If you say \"it works on my computer\", congrats, you're the only one. And also speaking hyperbolically. reply snozolli 1 hour agorootparentprevThe Bluetooth experience varies wildly. The Bluetooth stack is pretty enormous and complicated these days, so there's a lot of space for software and hardware vendors to screw things up. Apple-to-Apple seems to be dead reliable from everything I've heard. Samsung-to-Samsung seems almost as good. Apple or Android to random, Chinese car stereo might be a connectivity nightmare. Connecting to an OEM stereo with whatever implementation was poorly specified by the car company might also be a nightmare. reply johnnyanmac 1 hour agorootparentprevSadly, the most prevailing standards are rarely the best ones.

Theres a lot of weirdness around Bluetooth implementations between platforms and now I’m on the hook to either support them or tell users nope. I’d rather be doing neither and just be the user or someone else’s nice cross platform Bluetooth rust library.

Hilarious and impressive; I’d love to hear more, do you have more details, context or source? reply qdot76367 16 hours agorootparentSource was me, from some friends that were trying to use the library and the name was causing issues with contracts.

And the least? reply qdot76367 17 hours agorootparentBest: Funny enough, it's for a (set of) device(s) that constantly causes me issues, the OSR-2/SR-6/SSR-1. Here's a background video I did on the hardware: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFcrNk33_io It's DIY, 3d-printed hardware that's incredibly extensible, and has a decently designed abstract communication protocol that I've ended up pointing other DIY creators at. Keeping up with everything the hardware can do while also trying to make it work with our generalized commands is a challenge, but it's a good challenge, because we don't see a ton of innovation from the large commercial manufacturers. Least enjoy: We support over 500 devices now, so this is just a whole classes of devices at this point heh. There's a lot of hardware we support that's just not very good to begin with, and users can't tell whether it's our library or the hardware hardware that sucks. Then there's the hardware that makes very... odd decisions about how to do things. For instance, there was a brand known as MuSE or Lovespouse that's been popular for the past couple of years. Instead of creating a bluetooth connection to the device, the device acts as a host and listens for advertisements w/ specialized data in order to set vibrator power. Not only is this easily hackable (there was a bunch of articles about someone doing exactly that with a flipper zero last year), it's damn near impossible for us to implement cross platform support for, as advertisement creation in BLE is wildly different across platforms, and doesn't even exist on iOS (the company themselves only shipped on android, where buttplug works on win/mac/linux/android/iOS). On top of that, the Lovespouse devices were extremely cheap ($10-30US sometimes), so we had users buying them then asking if we supported them, and all we could say was \"nope\". reply HeyLaughingBoy 41 minutes agorootparentI used to work in the Group Fitness (gym electronics) space and this is exactly how some BLE heart rate monitors get around the problems with otherwise requiring the host to connect to 20+ devices to capture their data. Put heart rate into the Manufacturer-Specific region of the advertising packet and boom, no one needs a connection. Problem is that it's non-standard, so every device packages the data a different way. reply qdot76367 24 minutes agorootparentOh lord do I have some stories there. Way back in the nascent Quantified Self days, I ran http://openyou.org, which was basically \"Buttplug for consumer health devices\" (I mean I guess Buttplug is Buttplug for a specific type of consumer health device but, well, you get the idea). There's a god damned heart rate profile standard in the bluetooth spec AND YET I'm not sure I ever actually worked on a device that used it. :| reply fnordlord 16 hours agoparentprevCool to see someone quoting Cex 20+ years later. I listened to his stuff a ton back in the day and actually revisited only just a few months ago. Holds up just fine. reply qdot76367 15 hours agorootparentNow realizing it's been... 23 years since I saw Cex open for Kid606 and I'm gonna go crumble to dust now. reply YeGoblynQueenne 7 hours agorootparentI suspect you folks are not talking about this Cex: https://uk.webuy.com/ Which isn't a \"he\" as far as I can tell. There's a shop near were I live. I always pronounced them \"sex\" and everyone always told me that's not how it's pronounced, but never told me how else it's pronounced. reply adityaathalye 13 hours agoparentprevI love your ethics statement. TBH, this mindset ought to be the bottom line for any serious software (non-demoscene / non-fun-and-games type). Without pervasive empathy for the user, it's kind of hard to do the right thing in the first place. Especially within the strange organisms that are organisations. reply aorloff 13 hours agoparentprevHow many BPD do you estimate your software is supporting nowadays ? reply qdot76367 12 hours agorootparent1000s at least.

I was hitting an issue with their Bluetooth library controlling a we-vibe, and someone offered to drive over from the other side of the bay to help debug it. Bluetooth sniffer, and all. reply pornlover 3 hours agoprevThis is actually a think that Oculus / Meta feels like they didn't consider and still don't, even tho by their own statics it's the number one use for VR Some of this I'm sure is my particular usage but still... Examples: When the controller batteries are low I get a warning in the middle of my session and it sticks around way too long. If a battery dies in a controller the message is undismissible. The software I use works fine with one controller but instead I have to stop what I'm doing, remove the headset, find a battery, install it, put the headset back on, resume the software, and often reset the view because anytime you take the headset off it resets it's orientation. There are also times where it just says \"Fatal Error\" and exits when the battery dies. Another issue is I have 2d software I use in VR because having a giant screen is nice. But, Oculus insists on playing some annoying hum sound in the home screen with the built in desktop viewer. Note: I'm not using the 3D environments as my home screen because that ads more time to get stated. So, in any case, I have to launch something to get rid of the sound. I usually pick a video viewer app because it's very small and then pop up the desktop over it without selecting a video. But, Oculus is apparently unaware of this use case because they break this in some new way every few releases. The latest is, if you bring up the desktop in the middle of an app, after about 5 seconds it automatically takes you back to the VR app. It's almost like they forgot the feature exists. Other issues in this area are it went from a fairly rock solid feature to one out of 3 times entering into some bug loop where it flips between paused mode (desktop) and VR app mode. Being able to get out of this loop bug has about a 1 in 4 chance. Fixing it removing the headset and restarting the Oculus software on the PC. Then starting whatever apps you were in. Note that I'm using a Rift-S. I tried using a Quest 3 with Link which tries to give you the same experience but the Link was way way too flaky, crashing 1 of 3 times, when I pulled up the desktop. Another feature that broke, which I used frequently, was pulling up the desktop and pinning it so it stays visible while a VR app is running. It was a great way to goon. And, all of this is using porn software which makes it hard to make bug report that will be taken seriously. reply theoa 15 hours agoprevOne of the best posts of the year!

Imagine devs deciding it's the best option for managing some enterprise device, onboarding would be so funny. \"Yeah and now you need to enter the address of our buttplug server [..]\" reply qdot76367 1 hour agorootparentYou're absolutely correct! I mention this elsewhere in the documentation even. Buttplug really is just a userland HID manager at its core. The only specialized part is the context of commands we send to devices. The original plan (and it may still happen, who knows) was to figure out a way to chop off that top message layer and create a generalized system for doing exactly what you've said. That was going to be called 'deviceplug', and it's why btleplug is under the 'deviceplug' org on github (https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug). I've just never gotten around to it because I'm not quite ready for the additional support burden yet. All that said, Buttplug is also a haptics experimentation project aimed at finding out what it's like to create a way to communicate about a very specific type of touch via technology and programming. There are specific goals within the project related to that, but the amount of tech required to actually pull that off means I end up with what basically amounts of a fleet management framework. :) reply arj 4 hours agoprevSerious question. Do you put buttplug.io on your CV? :) reply qdot76367 1 hour agoparentDepends on where I'm sending the CV!

Just look up the reports of what can go wrong --it's not pretty. (\"do not press it on your scrotum\" is the frequent community refrain.)

In the past ten years or so of having done somewhat serious computing and zero cybersecurity whatsoever, I have my mind concluded, feel free to disagree. Approximately 100% of CVEs, crashes, bugs, slowdowns, and pain points of computing have to do with various forms of deserialising binary data back into machine-readable data structures. All because a) human programmers forget to account for edge cases, and b) imperative programming languages allow us to do so. This includes everything from: decompression algorithms; font outline readers; image, video, and audio parsers; video game data parsers; XML and HTML parsers; the various certificate/signature/key parsers in OpenSSL (and derivatives); and now, this CrowdStrike content parser in its EDR program. That wager stands, by the way, and I'm happy to up the ante by £50 to account for my second theory. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 10 hours agoparentThere's at least five different things that went wrong simultaneously. 1. Poorly written code in the kernel module crashed the whole OS, and kept trying to parse the corrupted files, causing a boot loop. Instead of handling the error gracefully and deleting/marking the files as corrupt. 2. Either the corrupted files slipped through internal testing, or there is no internal testing. 3. Individual settings for when to apply such updates were apparently ignored. It's unclear whether this was a glitch or standard practice. Either way I consider it a bug(it's just a matter of whether it's a software bug or a bug in their procedures). 4. This was pushed out everywhere simultaneously instead of staggered to limit any potential damage. 5. Whatever caused the corruption in the first place, which is anyone's guess. reply rco8786 6 hours agorootparentNumber 4 continues to be the most surprising bit to me. I could not fathom having a process that involves deploying to 8.5 million remote machines simultaneously. Bugs in code I can almost always understand and forgive, even the ones that seem like they’d be obvious with hindsight. But this is just an egregious lack of the most basic rollout standards. reply mbreese 3 hours agorootparentFor me, number 1 is the worst of the bunch. You should always expect that there will be bugs in processes, input files, etc… the fact that their code wasn’t robust enough to recognize a corrupted file and not crash is inexcusable. Especially in kernel code that is so widely deployed. If any one of the five points above hadn’t happened, this event would have been avoided. However, if number 1 had been addressed - any of the others could have happened (or all at the same time) and it would have been fine. I understand that we should assume that bugs will be present anywhere, which is why staggered deployments are also important. If there had been staggered deployments, the. The damage would have happened, but it would have been localized. I think security people would argue against a staged deployment though, as if it were discovered what the new definitions protected against, an exploit could be developed quickly to put those servers that aren’t in the “canary” group at risk. (At least in theory — I can’t see how staggering deployment over a 6-12 hour window would have been that risky). reply timmytokyo 2 hours agorootparentThey're all terrible, but I agree #1 is particularly egregious for a company ostensibly dedicated to security. A simple fuzz tester would have caught this type of bug, so they clearly don't perform even a minimal amount of testing on their code. reply thundershart 4 hours agorootparentprevSurely, CrowdStrike's safety posture for update rollouts is in serious need of improvement. No argument there. But is there any responsibility for the clients consuming the data to have verified these updates prior to taking them in production? I haven't worn the sysadmin hat in a while now, but back when I was responsible for the upkeep of many thousands of machines, we'd never have blindly consumed updates without at least a basic smoke test in a production-adjacent UAT type environment. Core OS updates, firmware updates, third party software, whatever -- all of it would get at least some cursory smoke testing before allowing it to hit production. On the other hand, given EDR's real-world purpose and the speed at which novel attacks propagate, there's probably a compelling argument for always taking the latest definition/signature updates as soon as they're available, even in your production environments. I'm certainly not saying that CrowdStrike did nothing wrong here, that's clearly not the case. But if conventional wisdom says that you should kick the tires on the latest batch of OS updates from Microsoft in a test environment, maybe that same rationale should apply to EDR agents? reply kiitos 2 hours agorootparent> But is there any responsibility for the clients consuming the data to have verified these updates prior to taking them in production In the boolean sense, yes. United Airlines (for example) is ultimately responsible for their own production uptime, so any change they apply without validation is a risk vector. In pragmatic terms, it's a bit fuzzier. Does CrowdStrike provide any practical way for customers to validate, canary-deploy, etc. changes before applying them to production? And not just changes with type=important, but all changes? From what I understand, the answer to that question is no, at least for the type=channel-update change that triggered this outage. In which case I think the blame ultimately falls almost entirely on CrowdStrike. reply cozzyd 1 hour agorootparentArguably United airlines shouldn't have chosen a product they can't test updates of, though maybe there are no good options. reply suzzer99 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah one of the major problems seems to be CrowdStrike's assumptions that channel files are benign. Which isn't true if there's a bug in your code that only gets triggered by the right virus definition. I don't know how you could assert that this is impossible, hence channel files should be treated as code. reply stoolpigeon 4 hours agorootparentprevI think point 3 of the grand parent indicates admins were not given an opportunity to test this. My company had a lot of Azure vms impacted by this and I'm not sure who the admin was who should have tested it. Microsoft? I don't think we have anything to do with crowdstrike software on our vms. ( I think - I'm sure I'll find out this week.) Edit: I just learned the Azure central region failure wasn't related to the larger event - and we weren't impacted by the crowd strike issue - I didn't know it was two different things. So my second part of the comment is irrelevant. reply thundershart 4 hours agorootparentOh, I'd missed point #3 somehow. If individual consumers weren't even given the opportunity to test this, whether by policy or by bug, then ... yeesh. Even worse than I'd thought. Exactly which team owns the testing is probably left up to each individual company to determine. But ultimately, if you have a team of admins supporting the production deployment of the machines that enable your business, then someone's responsible for ensuring the availability of those machines. Given how impactful this CrowdStrike incident was, maybe these kinds of third-party auto-update postures need to be reviewed and potentially brought back into the fold of admin-reviewed updates. reply volkl48 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not an option. While the admins at the customer have the ability to control when/how revisions of the client software go out (and this, can + generally do their own testing, can decide to stay one rev back as default, etc), there is no control over updates to the kind of update/definition files that were the primary cause here. Which is also why you see every single customer affected - what you are suggesting is simply not an available thing to do at present for them. At least for now - I imagine that some kind of staggered/slowed/ringed option will have to be implemented in the future if they want to retain customers. reply gitfan86 6 hours agorootparentprevThey probably don't get to claim agile story points until the ticket is in finished state.

They are quite vocal when customers don’t turn in automatic updates. It makes sense in a way - given their fast growth strategy (from nowhere to top 3) and desire to “do things differently” - the iconoclast upstarts that redefine the industry. Or to summarise - hubris. reply hello_moto 4 hours agorootparentTo catch 0day quickly, EDR needs to know \"how\". The \"how\" here is AV definition or a way to identify the attack. In CS-speak: content. Catching 0day quickly results in good reputation that your EDR works well. If people turn off their AV definition auto-update, they are at-risk. Why use EDR if folks don't want to stop attack quickly? reply 77pt77 3 hours agorootparentprev> They are quite vocal when customers don’t turn in automatic updates. I'm sorry but this is the customer's fault. If I'm using your services you work for me and you don't get to bully me into doing whatever you think needs to be done. People that chose this solution need to be penalized, but they won't. reply mbreese 3 hours agorootparentCustomers don’t always have a choice here. They could be restricted by compliance programs (PCI, et al) and be required under those terms to have auto updates on. Compliance also has to share some of the blame here, if best practices (local testing) aren’t allowed to be followed in the name of “security”. reply nerdjon 2 hours agorootparentThis needs to keep being repeated anytime someone wants to blame the company. Many don’t have a choice, a lot of compliance is doing x to satisfy a checkbox and you don’t have a lot of flexibility in that or you may not be able to things like process credit cards which is kinda unacceptable depending on your company. (Note: I didn’t say all) CrowdStrike automatic update happens to satisfy some of those checkboxes. reply cruffle_duffle 3 hours agorootparentprevOh the games I have to play with story points that have personal performance metrics attached to them.

Is there anything we can take from other professions/tradecraft/unions/legislation to ensure shops can’t skip the basic best practices we are aware of in the industry like staged rollouts? How do we set incentives to prevent this? Seriously the App Store was raking in $$ from us for years with no support for staged rollouts and no other options. reply avree 32 minutes agorootparentprevA lot of snarky replies to this comment, but the reality is that if you were selling an anti-virus, identified a malicious virus, and then chose not to update millions of your machines with that virus’s signature, you’d also be in the wrong. reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentprevMalware signature updates are supposed to be deployed ASAP, because every minute may count when a new attack is spreading. The mistake may have been to apply that policy indiscriminately. reply rwmj 9 hours agorootparentprevZero effort to fuzz test the parser too. I mean, we know how to harden parsers against bugs and attacks, and any semi-competent fuzzer would have caught such a trivial bug. reply jatins 5 hours agorootparentYou are seriously overestimating the engineering practises at these companies. I have worked in \"enterprise security\" previously though not at this scale. In a previous life I worked with of the engineering leaders currently at Crowdstrike. I'll bet you this company has some arbitrary unit test coverage requirements for PRs which developers game be mocking the heck out of dependencies. I am sure they have some vanity sonarqube integration to ensure great \"code quality\". This likely also went through manual QA. However I am sure the topic of fuzz testing would not have come up once. These companies sell checkbox compliance, and they themselves develop their software the same way. Checking all the \"quality engineering\" boxes with very little regards for long term engineering initiatives that would provide real value. And I am not trying to kick Crowdstrike when they are down. It's the state of any software company run by suits with myopic vision. Their engineering blogs and their codebases are poles apart. reply mavhc 9 hours agorootparentprevAV software is a great target for malware, badly written, probably runs too much stuff in the kernel, tries to parse everything reply Comfy-Tinwork 7 hours agorootparentAnd at the very least straight to system level access if not more. reply londons_explore 6 hours agorootparentAV software needs kernel privilidges to have access to everything it needs to inspect, but the actual inspection of that data should be done with no privilidges.

It is not possible that only this pattern caused the crash, and fuzzing omitted to try this unfuzzy pattern? reply Retr0id 7 hours agorootparentCompetent fuzzers don't just use random bytes, they systematically explore the state-space of the target program. If there's a crash state to be found by feeding in a file full of null bytes, it's probably going to be found quickly. A fun example is that if you point AFL at a JPEG parser, it will eventually \"learn\" to produce valid JPEG files as test cases, without ever having been told what JPEG file is supposed to look like. https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-th... reply rwmj 6 hours agorootparentAFL is really \"magical\". It finds bugs very quickly and with little effort on our part except to leave it running and look at the results occasionally. We use it to fuzz test a variety of file formats and network interfaces, including QEMU image parsing, nbdkit, libnbd, hivex. We also use clang's libfuzzer with QEMU which is another good fuzzing solution. There's really no excuse for CrowdStrike not to have been using fuzzing. reply monsieurbanana 9 hours agorootparentprevIn my limited experience, I thought any serious fuzzing program does test for all \"standard\" patters like only null bytes, empty strings, etc... reply omeid2 9 hours agorootparentprevThe files in question has a magic number is \"0xAAAAAAAA\" so it is not possible that the file was all zeros. reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentprevNo, it wasn’t all zeros: https://x.com/patrickwardle/status/1814782404583936170 reply formerly_proven 9 hours agorootparentprevInstrumented fuzzing (like AFL and friends) tweaks the input to traverse unseen code paths in the target, so they're super quick to find stuff like \"heyyyyy, nobody is actually checking if this offset is in bounds before loading from that address\". reply gliptic 9 hours agorootparentprevNo, it wasn't. Crowdstrike denied it had to do with zeros in the files. reply jojobas 8 hours agorootparentAt this point I wouldn't be paying too much attention to what Crowdstrike is saying. reply hello_moto 4 hours agorootparentHave to speak the truth albeit at minimum, in case legal... reply kchr 3 hours agorootparentWhich also explains why they, only if needed to cover their back legally, confirm or deny details being shared on social and mass media. reply watwut 9 hours agorootparentprevPossible? Yes. Likely? No. reply dcuthbertson 4 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if it was pushed anywhere that didn't crash, as an extension of \"It works on my machine. Ship it!\" I've built a couple of kernel drivers over the years and what I know is that \".sys\" files are to the kernel as \".dll\" files are to user-space programs in that the ones with code in them run only after they are loaded and a desired function is run (assuming boilerplate initialization code is good). I've never made a data-only .sys file, but I don't see why someone couldn't. In that case, I'd guess that no one ever checked it was correct, and the service/program that loads it didn't do any verification either -- why would it, the developers of said service/program would tend to trust their own data .sys file would be valid, never thinking they'd release a broken file or consider that files sometimes get corrupted -- another failure mode waiting to happen on some unfortunate soul's computer. reply kchr 3 hours agorootparentThe file extension is `sys` by convention, it's nothing magical to it and it's not handled in any special way by the OS. In the case of CrowdStrike, there seems to be some confusion as to why they use this file extension since it's only supposed to be a config/data file to be used by the real kernel driver. reply pclmulqdq 5 hours agorootparentprevNumber 4 is what everyone will fixate on, but I have the biggest problem with number 1. Anything like this sort of file should have (1) validation on all its pointers and (2) probably >2 layers of checksumming/signing. They should generally expect these files to get corrupted in transit once in a while, but they didn't seem to plan for anything other than exactly perfect communication between their intent and their kernel driver. reply simonh 9 hours agorootparentprevThere is a story out that the problem was introduced in a post processing step after testing. That makes more sense than that there was no testing. If true it means they thought they’d tested the update, but actually hadn’t. reply ratorx 8 hours agorootparentprevI’d also maybe add another one on the Windows end: 6) some form of sandboxing/error handling/api changes to make it possible to write safer kernel modules (not sure if it already exists and was just not used). It seems like the design could be better if a bad kernel module can cause a boot loop in the OS… reply leosarev 6 hours agorootparentThere is sandboxing API in Windows. It's called running programs in userspace. reply hello_moto 4 hours agorootparentRun what a userspace? reply layer8 2 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a tough problem, because you also don’t want the system to start without the CrowdStrike protection. Or more generally, a kernel driver is supposedly installed for a reason, and presumably you don’t want to keep the system running if it doesn’t work. So the alternative would be to shut down the system upon detection of the faulty driver without rebooting, which wouldn’t be much of an improvement in the present case. reply ratorx 1 hour agorootparentI can imagine better defaults. Assuming the threat vector is malicious programs running in userspace (probably malicious programs in kernel space is game over anyway right?), then you could simply boot into safe mode or something instead of crashlooping. One of the problems with this outage was that you couldn’t even boot into safe mode without having the bit locker recovery key. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentYou don’t want to boot into safe mode with networking enabled if the software that is supposed to detect attacks from the network isn’t running. Safe mode doesn’t protect you from malicious code in userspace, it only “protects” you from faulty drivers. Safe mode is for troubleshooting system components, not for increasing security. I don’t know the exact reasoning why safe mode requires the BitLocker recovery key, but presumably not doing so would open up an attack vector defeating the BitLocker protection. reply dartos 6 hours agorootparentprevBugs happen. Not staggering the updates is what blew my mind. reply londons_explore 6 hours agorootparentSince the issue manifested at 04:09 UTC, which is 11pm where Crowdstrikes HQ is, I would guess someone was working late at night and skipped the proper process so they could get the update done and go to bed.

This is the most interesting question to me because it doesn't seem like there is an obviously guessable answer. It seem very unlikely to me that a company like CrowdStrike pushes out updates of any kind without doing some sort of testing, but the widespread nature of the outage would also seem to suggest any sort of testing setup should have caught the issue.

Almost all of them are various flavor of fucking up a parser or misusing it (in particular, all the injection cases are typically caused by writing stupid code that glues strings together instead of proper parsing). reply lolinder 35 minutes agorootparentThat's not parsing, that's the inverse of parsing. It's taking untrusted data and injecting it into a string that will later be parsed into code without treating the data as untrusted and adapting accordingly. It's compiling, of a sort. Parsing is the reverse—taking an untrusted string (or binary string) that is meant to be code and converting it into a data structure. Both are the result of taking untrusted data and assuming it'll look like what you expect, but both are not parsing issues. reply TeMPOraL 0 minutes agorootparent> It's taking untrusted data and injecting it into a string that will later be parsed into code without treating the data as untrusted and adapting accordingly. Which is precisely why parsing should've been used here instead. The correct way to do this is to work at the level after parsing, not before it. \"SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar LIKE ${untrusted input}\" is dumb. Parsing the query with a placeholder in it, replacing it as an abstract node in the parsed form with data, and then serializing to string if needed to be sent elsewhere, is the correct way to do it, and is immune to injection attacks. bostik 11 hours agoparentprev> Approximately 100% of CVEs, crashes, bugs, [...], deserialising binary data I'd make that 98%.

Once you're aware of the risks of a bad parser you're halfway there. Write a parser with proper parsing theory in mind and in a language that forces you to handle all cases. Then fuzz the program, turn bad inputs that turn up into permanent regression tests, and write your own tests with your knowledge of the inner workings of your parser in mind.

You think everyone writing code in the US would give two shits about the quality of their output if they see the CEO pocketing another private jet while they can barley make big-city rent? Hell, even well paid devs at top companies in the US can be careless and lazy if their company doesn't care about quality. Have you seen some of the vulnerabilities and bugs that make it into the Android source code and on Pixel devices? And guess what, that code was written by well paid developers in the US, hired at Google leetcode standards, yet would give far-east sweatshops a run for their money in terms of carelessness.

Too many companies like CrowdStrike are run by managers who think that management, sales, and marketing are the important activities. Software development is just an unpleasant expense that needs to be minimized. Hence: outsourcing. That said, I have had some experience with classic offshoring. Cultural differences make a huge difference! My experience with \"typical\" programmers from India, China, et al is that they do exactly what they are told. Their boss makes the design decisions down to the last detail, and the \"programmers\" are little more than typists. I specifically remember one sweatshop where the boss looped continually among the desks, giving each person very specific instructions of what they were to do next. The individual programmers implemented his instructions literally, with zero thought and zero knowledge of the big picture. Even if the boss was good enough to actually keep the big picture of a dozen simultaneous activities in his head, his non-thinking minions certainly made mistakes.

What you can't have is a \"why don't they just\" simple and obvious solution that makes it cheap without making it either less secure, less performant, or both.

But in a non-dysfunctional company, you have a hierarchy of trust, where each management level knows and trusts the people above and below them. You also have siloed data, where people have access to the specific things they need to do their jobs. And you have disaster mitigation mechanisms for when things go wrong. Having worked in companies of different sizes and with different trust cultures, I do think that problems start to arise when you add things like individual monitoring and control. You're basically telling people that you don't trust them, which makes them see their employer in an adversarial role, which actually makes them start to behave less trustworthy, which further diminishes trust across the company, harms collaboration, and eventually harms productivity and security. reply kemotep 7 hours agorootparentSetting aside the possibility of deploying an EDR like Crowdstrike just being a box ticking exercise for compliance or insurance purposes, can something like an EDR be used not because of a lack of trust but a desire to protect the environment?

As long as they don't botch their own software, that is :D reply imiric 6 hours agorootparent> How else to protect a complex IT environment with thousands of assets in form of servers and workstations, without some kind of endpoint protection? There is no straightforward answer to this question. Assuming that your infrastructure is \"secure\" because you deployed an EDR solution is wrong. It only gives you a false sense of security. The reality is that security takes a lot of effort from everyone involved, and it starts by educating people. There is no quick bandaid solution to these problems, and, as with anything in IT, any approach has tradeoffs. In this case, and particularly after the recent events, it's evident that an EDR system is as much of a liability as it is an asset—perhaps even more so. You give away control of your systems to a 3rd party, and expect them to work flawlessly 100% of the time. The alarming thing is how much this particular vendor was trusted with critical parts of our civil infrastructure. It not only exposes us to operational failures due to negligence, but to attacks from actors who will seek to exploit that 3rd party. reply kchr 2 hours agorootparentI totally agree. In my current work environment, we do deploy EDR but it is primarily for assets critical for delivering our main service to customers. Ironically, this incident caused them all to be unavailable and there is for sure a lesson to be learned here! It is not considered a silver bullet by the security team, rather a last-resort detection mechanism for suspicious behavior (for example if the network segmentation or access control fails, or someone managed to get foothold by other means). It also helps them identify which employees need more training as they keep downloading random executables from the web. reply matwood 3 hours agorootparentprev> starts by educating people Any security certification has a section on regularly educating employees on the topic.

Apart from geuinely evil people, there are unlimited variables that dictate people's behavior. Culture, personality, nutrition, financial situation, mood, stress, bully coworkers, intrinsic values, etc etc. To think people are all fair and honest \"unless\" is a really harmful worldview to have and in my opinion the reason for a lot of bad things being allowed to happen and continue (troughout all society, not just work). Zero-trust in IT is just the digitized version of \"trust is earned\". In computers you can be more crude and direct about it, but it should be the same for social connections and interactions. reply matwood 3 hours agorootparent> You seem to start from a premise that all people are honest You have to start with that premise otherwise organizations and society fail.

A security professional though would tell you that even in such a world, you can not expect even the most diligent folks to be able to identify all risks (e.g. phishing became so good, even professionals can’t always discern the real from fake), or practice perfect opsec (which probably requires one to be a psychopath). reply protomolecule 9 hours agorootparentprev\"But in a non-dysfunctional company, you have a hierarchy of trust, where each management level knows and trusts the people above and below them. \" Even in a company of two sometimes a husband or a wife betrays the trust.

Truthfully, it must be practically infeasible to transform security practices of a large company overnight. Most of the time they buy into these products because they're chasing a security certification (ISO 27001, SOC2, etc.), and by just deploying this to their entire fleet they get to sidestep the actually difficult part.

Computer users should be educated about security, given control of their devices, and trusted that they will do the right thing. If a company can't do that, that's a sign that they don't have good security practices to begin with, and don't do a good job at hiring and training. The only reason this kind of software is used is so that companies can tick a certification checkbox that gives the appearance of running a tight ship.

For example by doing continuous scans that consume so much CPU the machine stays thermally throttled at all times. (Yes, really. I've seen a colleague raising a ticket about AV making it near-impossible to do dev work, to which IT replied the company will reimburse them for a cooling pad for the laptop, and closed the issue as solved.) The problem is so bad that Microsoft, despite Defender being by far the lightest and least bullshit AV solution, created \"dev drive\", a designated drive that's excluded by design from Defender scanning, as a blatant workaround for corporate policies preventing users and admins from setting custom Defender exclusions. Before that, your only alternative was to run WSL2 or a regular VM, which are opaque to AVs, but that tends to be restricted by corporate too, because \"sekhurity\". And yes, people in these situations invent workarounds, such as VMs, unauthorized third-party SaaS, or using personal devices, because at the end of the day, the work still needs to be done. So all those security measures do is reduce actual security. reply kchr 6 hours agorootparentMost AV and EDR solutions support exceptions, either on specific assets or fleets of assets. You can make exceptions for some employees (for example developers or IT) while keeping (sane) defaults for everybody else.

Could you tell me more about your experience with it? reply imiric 10 hours agorootparentI don't have first-hand experience with Kolide, as I refused to install it when it was pushed upon everyone in a company I worked for. Complaints voiced by others included false positives (flagging something as a threat when it wasn't, or alerting that a system wasn't in place when it was), being too intrusive and affecting their workflow, and privacy concerns (reading and reporting all files, web browsing history, etc.). There were others I'm not remembering, as I mostly tried to stay away from the discussion, but it was generally disliked by the (mostly technical) workforce. Everyone just accepted it as the company deemed it necessary to secure some enterprise customers. Also, Kolide's whole spiel about \"honest security\"[1] reeks of PR mumbo jumbo whose only purpose is to distance themselves from other \"bad\" solutions in the same space, when in reality they're not much different. It's built by Facebook alumni, after all, and relies on FB software (osquery). [1]: https://honest.security/ reply DrRobinson 8 hours agorootparentI think some of the information here is misleading and a bit unfair. > being too intrusive and affecting their workflow Kolide is a reporting tool, it doesn't for example remove files or put them in quarantine. You also cannot execute commands remotely like in Crowdstrike. As you mentioned, it's based on osquery which makes it possible to query machine information using SQL. Usually, Kolide is configured to send a Slack message or email if there is a finding, which I guess can be seen as intrusive but IMO not very. > reading and reporting all files It does not read and report all files as far as I know, but I think it's possible to make SQL queries to read specific files. But all files or file names aren't stored in Kolide or anything like that. And that live query feature is audited (ens users can see all queries run against their machines) and can be disabled by administrators. > web browsing history This is not directly possible as far as I know, but maybe via a file read query but it's not something built-in out of the box/default. And again, custom queries are transparent to users and can be disabled. > Kolide's whole spiel about \"honest security\"[1] reeks of PR mumbo jumbo whose only purpose is to distance themselves from other \"bad\" solutions in the same space While it's definitely a PR thing, they might still believe in it and practice what they preach. To me it sounds like a good thing to differentiate oneself from bad actors. Kolide gives users full transparency of what data is collected via their Privacy Center, and they allow end users to make decisions about what to do about findings (if anything) rather than enforcing them. > It's built by Facebook alumni, after all, and relies on FB software (osquery).

My memory may be vague on the specifics, but there were certainly many complaints in the areas I mentioned in the company I worked at. That said, since Kolide/osquery is a very flexible product, the complaints might not have been directed at the product itself, but at how it was configured by the security department as well. There are definitely some growing pains until the company finds the right balance of features that everyone finds acceptable. Re: intrusiveness, it doesn't matter that Kolide is a report-only tool. Although, it's also possible to install extensions[1,2] that give it a deeper control over the system. The problem is that the policies it enforces can negatively affect people's workflow. For example, forcing screen locking after a short period of inactivity has dubious security benefits if I'm working from a trusted environment like my home, yet it's highly disruptive. (No, the solution is not to track my location, or give me a setting I have to manage...) Forcing automatic system updates is also disruptive, since I want to update and reboot at my own schedule. Things like this add up, and the combination of all of them is equivalent to working in a babyproofed environment where I'm constantly monitored and nagged about issues that don't take any nuance into account, and at the end of the day do not improve security in the slightest. Re: web browsing history, I do remember one engineer looking into this and noticing that Kolide read their browser's profile files, and coming up with a way to read the contents of the history data in SQLite files. But I am very vague on the details, so I won't claim that this is something that Kolide enables by default. osquery developers are clearly against this kind of use case[3]. It is concerning that the product can, in theory, be exploited to do this. It's also technically possible to pull any file from endpoints[4], so even if this is not directly possible, it could easily be done outside of Kolide/osquery itself. > Kolide gives users full transparency of what data is collected via their Privacy Center Honestly, why should I trust what that says? Facebook and Google also have privacy policies, yet have been caught violating their users' privacy numerous times. Trust is earned, not assumed based on \"trust me, bro\" statements. > For example React and Semgrep is also built by Facebook/Facebook alumni, but I don't really see the relevance other than some ad-hominem. Facebook has historically abused their users' privacy, and even has a Wikipedia article about it.[5] In the context of an EDR system, ensuring trust from users and handling their data with the utmost care w.r.t. their privacy are two of the most paramount features. Actually, it's a bit silly that Kolide/osquery is so vocal in favor of preserving user privacy, when this goes against working with employer-owned devices where employee privacy is definitely not expected. In any case, the fact this product is made by people who worked at a company built by exploiting its users is very relevant considering the type of software it is. React and Semgrep have an entirely different purpose.

You use web apps as much as possible. You store data in cloud storage. You restrict local file access and execute permissions. Authenticate using passkeys. The trouble is that people still need local file access, and use network file shares. You have hundreds of apps used by a handful of users that need to run locally. And a few intranet apps that are mission critical and have dubious security. That creates the necessity for wrapping users in firewalls, vpns, tls interception, end point security etc. And the less well it all works the more you need to fill the gaps. reply lyu07282 9 hours agorootparentprevThe sensor basically monitors everything that's happening on the system and then uses heuristics and known attack vectors and behavior to for example then lock compromised systems down.

If you manage a fleet of tens of thousands of systems and you need to protect against well funded organized crime? Employees running malicious code under their user is a given and can't be prevented.

If soneone from accounting starts uploading a lot of data, connects to Google cloud when you don't use any of their products, that should be odd. If we're talking about organized crime, I'm not convinced crowdstrike in particular doesn't actually enlarge the attack surface. So we had what now as the cause, a malformed binary ruleset that the parser, running with kernel privileges, choked on and crashed the system. Because of course the parsing needs to happen in kernel space and not a sandboxed process. That's enough for me to make assumptions about the quality of the rest of the software, and answer the question regarding attack surface. Before this incident nobody ever really looked at this product at all from a security standpoint, maybe because it is (supposed to be) a security product and thus cannot have any flaws.

As a red teamer developing malware for my team to evade EDR solutions we come across, I can tell you that EDR systems are essential. The phrase \"root kit powered endpoint surveillance\" is a mischaracterization, often fueled by misconceptions from the gaming community. These tools provide essential protection against sophisticated threats, and they catch them. Without them, my job would be 90% easier when doing a test where Windows boxes are included. > So the main tool would be open source and it would be transparent what it does exactly and that it is free of backdoors or really bad bugs. Open-source EDR solutions, like OpenEDR [1], exist but are outdated and offer poor telemetry. Assembling various GitHub POCs that exist for production EDR is impractical and insecure. The EDR sensor itself becomes the targeted thing. As a threat actor, the EDR is the only thing in your way most of the time. Open sourcing them increases the risk of attackers contributing malicious code to slow down development or introduce vulnerabilities. It becomes a nightmare for development, as you can't be sure who is on the other side of the pull request. TAs will do everything to slow down the development of a security sensor. It is a very adversarial atmosphere. > On the other hand it could still be a business model to supply malware signatures as a security team feeding this system. It is actually the other way around. Open-source malware heuristic rules do exist, such as Elastic Security's detection rules [2].

This is a such tired non-sequitur argument with no evidence whatsoever to back it up that the risk is actually higher for open source versus closed source. I can just easily argue that a state or non-state actor could buy[1], bribe or simply threaten to get weak code in a proprietary system, without users having any means to ever find out. On the other hand, it is always easier(easier not easy) to discover compromise in open-source like it happened with xz[2] and verify such reports independently. If there is no proof that compromise is less likely with closed source and it is far easier to discover them in open-source, the logical conclusion is simply open source is better for security libraries. Funding defensive security infrastructure which is open source and freely available for everyone to use even with 1/100th of the NSA budget that is effectively only offensive, would improve info-security enormously for everyone not just from nation state actors, but also from scammers etc. Instead we get companies like CS that have enormous vested interest in seeing that never happens and trying to scare the rest of us that open-source is bad for security.

But I think I'd disagree with the statement that open sourcing everything wouldn't cause any problem. Engineering isn't necessarily about peer reviewed studies, it's about empirical observations and applying the engineering method (which can be complemented by a more scientific one but shouldn't be confused for it). It's clear that this type of stuff is a game of cat and mouse. Attackers search for any possible vulnerability, bypass etc. It does make sense that exposing one side's machinery will make it easier for the other side to see how it works. A good example of that is how active hackers are at finding different ways to bypass Windows Defender by using certain types of Office file formats, or certain combinations of file conversions to execute code. Exposing the code would just make all of those immediately visible to everyone. Eventually that's something that gets exposed anyways, but I think the crucial part is timing and being a few steps ahead in the cat and mouse game.

I feel having the solution open sourced isn't bad from a code security standpoint, but rathee that it is simply not economically viable. To my knowledge most of the major open source technologies are currently funded by FAANG and purely because it's needed by them to conduct business and the moment it becomes inconvenient for them to support it they fork it or develop their own, see Terraform/Redis... I also cannot get behind a government funding model purely because it will simply become a design by committee nightmare because this isn't flashy tech. Just see how many private companies have beaten NASA to market in a pretty well funded and very flashy industry. The very government you want to fund these solutions are currently running on private companies infrastructure for all their IT needs.

I picture it as a high quality analog circuit board that does 1 thing and 1 thing only. No way to run anything else. Globally networked personal computers were kind of cultural revolution against the setting you describe. Everyone had their own private compute and compute time and everyone could share their own opinion. Computers became our personal extensions. This is what IBM, Atari, Commodore, Be, Microsoft and Apple (and later desktop Linux) sold. Now given this ideology, can a company own my limbs? If not, they can't own my computers. reply derefr 3 hours agorootparentprev> What does “our computer” mean when it is not owned by you, but issued to you to perform a task with by your employer? Well, presuming that: 1. the employee is issued a computer, that they have possession of even if not ownership (i.e. they bring the computer home with them, etc.) 2. and the employee is required to perform creative/intellectual labor activities on this computer — implying that they do things like connecting their online accounts to this computer; installing software on this computer (whether themselves or by asking IT to do it); doing general web-browsing on this computer; etc. 3. and where the extent of their job duties, blurs the line between \"work\" and \"not work\" (most salaried intellectual-labor jobs are like this) such that the employee basically \"lives in\" this computer, even when not at work... 4. ...to the point that the employee could reasonably conclude that it'd be silly for them to maintain a separate \"personal\" computer — and so would potentially sell any such devices (if they owned any), leaving them dependent on this employer-issued computer for all their computing needs... ...then I would argue that, by the same chain of reasoning as in the GP post, employers should not be legally permitted to “issue” employees such devices. Instead, the employer should either purchase such equipment for the employee, giving it to them permanently as a taxable benefit; or they should require that the employee purchase it themselves, and recompense them for doing so. Cyberpunk analogy: imagine you are a brain in a vat. Should your employer be able to purchase an arbitrary android body for you; make you use it while at work; and stuff it full of monitoring and DRM? No, that'd be awful. Same analogy, but with the veil stripped off: imagine you are paraplegic. Should your employer be allowed to issue you an arbitrary specific wheelchair, and require you to use it at work, and then monitor everything you do with it / limit what you can do with it because it’s “theirs”? No, that’d be ridiculous. And humanity already knows that — employers already can't do that, in any country with even a shred of awareness about accessibility devices. The employer — or very much more likely, the employer's insurance provider — just buys the person the chair. And then it's the employee's chair. And yes, by exactly the same logic, this also means that issuing an employee a company car should be illegal — at least in cases where the employee lives in a non-walkable area, and doesn't already have another car (that they could afford to keep + maintain + insure); and/or where their commute is long enough that they'd do most non-employment-related car-requiring things around work and thus using their company car. Just buy them a car. (Or, if you're worried they might run away with it, then lease-to-own them a car — i.e. where their \"equity in the car\" is in the form of options that vest over time, right along-side any equity they have in the company itself.) > Does that also apply to the operator at a switchboard… Actually, no! Because an operator of a switchboard is not a “user” of the computer that powers the switchboard, in the same sense that a regular person sitting at a workstation is a \"user\" of the workstation. The system in this case is a “kiosk computer”, and the operator is performing a prescribed domain-specific function through a limited UX they’re locked into by said system. The operator of a nuclear power plant is akin to a customer ordering food from a fast-food kiosk — just providing slightly more mission-critical inputs. (Or, for a maybe better analogy: they're akin to a transit security officer using one of those scanner kiosk-handhelds to check people's tickets.) If the \"computer\" the nuclear-plant operator was operating, exposed a purely electromechanical UX rather than a digital one — switches and knobs and LEDs rather than screens and keyboards[1] — then nothing about the operator's workflow would change. Which means that the operator isn't truly computing with the computer; they're just interacting with an interface that happens to be a computer. [1] ...which, in fact, \"modern\" nuclear plants are. The UX for a nuclear power plant control-center has not changed much since the 1960s; the sort of \"just make it a touchscreen\"-ification that has infected e.g. automotive has thankfully not made its way into these more mission-critical systems yet. (I believe it's all computers under the hood now, but those computers are GPIO-relayed up to panels with lots and lots of analogue controls. Or maybe those panels are USB HID devices these days; I dunno, I'm not a nuclear control-systems engineer.) Anyway, in the general case, you can recognize these \"the operator is just interacting with an interface, not computing on a computer\" cases because: • The machine has separate system administrators who log onto it frequently — less like a workstation, more like a server. • The machine is never allowed to run anything other than the kiosk app (which might be some kind of custom launcher providing several kiosk apps, but where these are all business-domain specific apps, with none of them being general-purpose \"use this device as a computer\" apps.) • The machine is set up to use domain login rather than local login, and keeps no local per-user state; or, more often, the machine is configured to auto-login to an \"app user\" account (in modern Windows, this would be a Mandatory User Profile) — and then the actual user authentication mechanism is built into the kiosk app itself. • Hopefully, the machine is using an embedded version of the OS, which has had all general-purpose software stripped out of it to remove vulnerability surface. reply valicord 1 hour agorootparent> the employee could reasonably conclude that it'd be silly for them to maintain a separate \"personal\" computer — and so would potentially sell any such devices What a bizarre leap of logic. Can Fedex employees reasonably sell their non-uniform clothes? Just because the employer in this scenario didn't 100% lock down the computer (which is a good thing because the alternative would be incredibly annoying for day-to-day work), doesn't mean the the employee can treat it as their own. Even from the privacy perspective, it would be pretty silly. Are you going to use the employer provided computer to apply to your next job? reply derefr 1 hour agorootparentPeople do do it, though. Especially poor people, who might not use their personal computers very often. Also, many people don't own a separate \"personal\" computer in the first place. Especially, again, poor people. (I know many people who, if needing to use \"a PC\" for something, would go to a public library to use the computers there.) Not every job is a software dev position in the Bay Area, where everyone has enough disposable income to have a pile of old technology laying around. Many jobs for which you might be issued a work laptop still might not pay enough to get you above the poverty line. McDonald's managers are issued work laptops, for instance. (Also, disregarding economic class for a moment: in the modern day, most people who aren't in tech solve most of their computing problems by owning a smartphone, and so are unlikely to have a full PC at home. But their phone can't do everything, so if they have a work computer they happen to be sat in front of for hours each day — whether one issued to them, or a fixed workstation at work — then they'll default to doing their rare personal \"productivity\" tasks on that work computer. And yes, this does include updating their CV!) --- Maybe you can see it more clearly with the case of company cars. People sometimes don't own any other car (that actually works) until they get issued a company car; so they end up using their company car for everything. (Think especially: tradespeople using their company-logo-branded work box-truck for everything. Where I live, every third vehicle in any parking lot is one of those.) And people — especially poorer people — also often sell their personal vehicle when they are issued a company car, because this 1. releases them from the need to pay a lease + insurance on that vehicle, and 2. gets them possibly tens of thousands of dollars in a lump sum (that they don't need to immediately reinvest into another car, because they can now rely on the company car.) reply valicord 1 hour agorootparentThe point is that if you do do it, it's on you to understand the limitations of using someone else property. Just like the difference between rental vs owned housing. There are also fairly obvious differences between work-issued computers and all of your other analogies: 1. A car (and presumably the cyberpunk android body) is much more expensive than a computer, so the downside of owning both a personal and a work one is much higher. 2. A chair or a wheel chair doesn't need security monitoring because it's a chair (I guess you could come up with an incredibly convoluted scenario where it would make sense to put GPS tracking in a wheelchair, but come on). > just buys the person the chair. And then it's the employee's chair. It's not because there's a law against loaning chairs, it's because the chair is likely customized for a specific person and can't be reused.

Which is, again, a situation so shitty that we've outlawed it entirely! And then also imposed further regulations on regular, non-employer landlords, about what kinds of conditions they can impose on tenants. (E.g. in most jurisdictions, your landlord can't restrict you from having guests stay the night in your room.) Tenants' rights are actually a great analogy for what I'm talking about here. A company-issued laptop is very much like an apartment, in that you're \"living in it\" (literally and figuratively, respectively), and that you therefore should deserve certain rights to autonomous possession/use, privacy, freedom from restriction/compromise in use, etc. While you don't literally own an apartment you're renting, the law tries to, as much as possible, give tenants the rights of someone who does own that property; and to restrict the set of legal justifications that a landlord can use to punish someone for exercising those (temporary) rights over their property. IMHO having the equivalent of \"tenants' rights\" for something like a laptop is silly, because that'd be a lot of additional legal edifice for not-much gain. But, unlike with real-estate rental, it'd actually be quite practical to just make the \"tenancy\" case of company IT equipment use impossible/illegal — forcing employers to do something else instead — something that doesn't force employees into the sort of legal area that would make \"tenants' rights\" considerations applicable in the first place. reply valicord 1 hour agorootparentNo, that would be more like sleeping at the office (purely because of employee preferences, not because the employer forces you to or anything like that) and complaining about security cameras. reply derefr 1 hour agorootparentprevTangent — a question you didn't ask, but I'll pretend you did: > If employers allowed employees to \"bring their own devices\", and then didn't force said employees to run MDM software on those devices, then how in the world could the employer guarantee the integrity of any line-of-business software the employee must run on the device; impose controls to stop PII + customer-shared data + trade secrets from being leaked outside the domain; and so forth? My answer to that question: it's safe to say that most people in the modern day are fine with the compromise that your device might be 100% yours most of the time; but, when necessary — when you decide it to be so — 99% yours, 1% someone else's. For example, anti-cheat software in online games. The anti-cheat logic in online games, is this little nugget of code that runs on a little sub-computer within your computer (Intel SGX or equivalent.) This sub-computer acts as a \"black box\" — it's something the root user of the PC can't introspect or tamper with. However: • Whenever you're not playing a game, the anti-cheat software isn't loaded. So most of the time, your computer is entirely yours. • You get to decide when to play an online game, and you are explicitly aware of doing so. • When you are playing an online game, most of your computer — the CPU's \"application cores\", and 99% of the RAM — is still 100% under your control. The anti-cheat software isn't actually a rootkit (despite what some people say); it can't affect any app that doesn't explicitly hook into it. • In a brute-force sense, you still \"control\" the little sub-computer as well — in that you can force it to stop running whatever it's running whenever you want. SGX and the like aren't like Intel's Management Engine (which really could be used by a state actor to plant a non-removable \"ring -3\" rootkit on your PC); instead, SGX is more like a TPM, or an FPGA: it's something that's ultimately controlled by the CPU from ring 0, just with a very circumscribed API that doesn't give the CPU the ability to \"get in the way\" of a workload once the CPU has deployed that workload to it, other than by shutting that workload off. As much as people like Richard Stallman might freak out at the above design, it really isn't the same thing as your employer having root on your wheelchair. It's more like how someone in a wheelchair knows that if they get on a plane, then they're not allowed to wheel their own wheelchair around on the plane, and a flight attendant will instead be doing that for them. How does that translate to employer MDM software? Well, there's no clear translation currently, because we're currently in a paradigm that favors employer-issued devices. But here's what we could do: • Modern PCs are powerful enough that anything a corporation wants you to do, can be done in a corporation-issued VM that runs on the computer. • The employer could then require the installation of an integrity-verification extension (essentially \"anti-cheat for VMs\") that ensures that the VM itself, and the hypervisor software that runs it, and the host kernel the hypervisor is running on top of, all haven't been tampered with. (If any of them were, then the extension wouldn't be able to sign a remote-attestation packet, and the employer's server in turn wouldn't return a decryption key for the VM, so the VM wouldn't start.) • The employer could feel free to MDM the VM guest kernel — but they likely wouldn't need to, as they could instead just lock it down in much-more-severe ways (the sorts of approaches you use to lock down a server! or a kiosk computer!) that would make a general-purpose PC next-to-useless, but which would be fine in the context of a VM running only line-of-business software. (Remember, all your general-purpose \"personal computer\" software would be running outside the VM. Web browsing? Outside the VM. The VM is just for interacting with Intranet apps, reading secure email, etc.) (Why yes, I am describing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_security.) reply eptcyka 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, that is why the owners of the computers (corps) use these tools - to maintain control over their hardware (and IP accessible on it).

This knife cuts both ways. reply fragmede 9 hours agorootparentIf only that were possible. Luckily for my employer, I end up thinking about problems to be solved during my off hours like when I'm sleeping and in the shower. Then again, I also think about non-work life problems sitting at my desk when I'm supposed to be working, so (hopefully) it evens out. reply imiric 8 hours agorootparentI don't think it's possible either. But the moment my employer forces me to install a surveillance rootkit on the machine I use for work—regardless of who owns the machine—any trust that existed in the relationship is broken.

Ask Question Asked 10 years, 9 months ago Modified 4 years, 11 months ago Viewed 37k times This question shows research effort; it is useful and clear 36 Save this question. Show activity on this post. While using an old (1907) book of transcriptions (on-line) The Parish Register of Gargrave in the County of York , I was puzzled by the number of dates recorded in the 16th and early 17th centuries that could be read easily as Roman numerals except for the addition of a j at the end. The pattern (if there is one) seems to be that if the number would ordinarily end with i then j is appended, but if it ends with v or x then there may be no extra character before the ordinal superscript (but in one case, there is!). I thought this may be a style quirk of a particular clerk, but now I am seeing it in other sources (but all Yorkshire based and pre-1700, because that is what I am reading at the moment). Is this a real phenomenon or just a coincidence? How widespread was the practice? What on earth did it mean? Why did they do it? england 17th-century date Share Improve this question Follow Follow this question to receive notifications edited Apr 2, 2017 at 12:10 Harry V.♦ 18.9k55 gold badges4747 silver badges100100 bronze badges asked Oct 10, 2013 at 1:54 FortiterFortiter 13.4k33 gold badges2020 silver badges6969 bronze badges 3 So is ij = 2, iij = 3, etc?

Show activity on this post. The letter j originated as a \"swash\" (florish) character at the end of Roman numerals, and only later became useful as a separate character. A j was used for the final i, to make it clear the number had ended. Until quite recent times it was still the recommended practice to use a final j in medical prescriptions, to avoid misunderstandings. See these instructions from 1919: So you should interpret xvij as 17, not 16. It's part of the number, not something appended.

(2013) (genealogy.stackexchange.com)343 points by kamaraju 13 hours agohidepastfavorite124 comments gpvos 8 hours agoThe Dutch digraph ij originated from the same custom. Originally written ii, later ij, and pronounced as a long i (English \"ee\"), the sound later shifted to be similar to English \"eye\", see the Dutch names for the cities Berlijn and Parijs. Meanwhile, the long i sound is now written as ie. IJ is the only Dutch digraph that tends to be treated as a single letter and is capitalized as such. In education in the Netherlands it is taught as the 25th letter instead of y, which does not occur in native Dutch words, and in the phone book it used to be sorted together (mixed) with y. But since the advent of computers it is generally sorted as i followed by j. There are a few place names like Ysselsteyn where Y is pronounced as IJ. reply syncsynchalt 5 minutes agoparentMy favorite part of ĳ is the folk transliteration to the character \"ÿ\". In cursive script, it's easy to see how \"ĳ\" becomes \"ÿ\". However, \"ÿ\"s Unicode codepoint of U+FF means it often shows up as a placeholder for \"unrecognized character\", doubling down the misapprehension that \"ÿ\" is the correct character in dutch text. reply robador 8 hours agoparentprevI'm pretty sure I was taught the letter y (I-grec) as part of the alfabet and not the ij (I'm Dutch as well). The other day I was surprised to see that an alfabet song that my kid was watching used the ij instead of the y. And I thought you were talking about IJsselstein, but saw there's indeed also Ysselsteyn, and they're not the same town (though pronounced the same). Interestingly we've then 3 ways to write the same sound (though y can also be pronounced as 'ee', e.g. Yvonne); y, ij, ei, oh, and I suppose 'ey' should be counted as well though that's not used in modern spelling. Cool reply saghm 4 hours agorootparentOne of the things that blew my mind when I took a few semesters of Dutch in college is that the language occasionally gets amended (or more precisely, the way it's taught in schools is amended, although after a generation or two of delay the effects are the same) to fix inconsistencies. I can't remember if clarifying 'ij' and 'y' was one of those, but I remember the professor telling us about how a while back people were upset when they updated the spelling of the word \"pannenkoek\" (which I think had previously been spelled \"pannekoek\"), which some people apparently still haven't gotten over after almost three decades[1]. I wish there were enough willpower for something similar for English, but it's probably too late to reach any sort of compromise on whether to use a \"u\" in words like \"color\"/\"colour\". [1]: https://dutchreview.com/news/dutch-government-argue-over-spe... reply prerok 3 hours agorootparentWell, I think the difference is that for Dutch, people are mostly colocated, i.e. share the same space and have a national curriculum to guide the use. For English, it's quite different because many countries list it as their official language but may have diverged spellings and meanings and there is no single body to direct the curriculum. The most notable is the US vs. British English and the u in colo(u)r is a mere spelling example. Consider surgery or elevator, which are bigger discrepancies. I remember from my school days, as a non-native speaker, these were much more troublesome and we had a special test just to check we could tell which is which in US and GB English. reply dragonwriter 1 hour agorootparent> For English, it's quite different because many countries list it as their official language but may have diverged spellings and meanings and there is no single body to direct the curriculum. The most notable is the US The US doesn't have an official language, though most institutions operate primarily in English, and all US states that have one or more official languages include English on that list. reply daniel-s 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the reason is different. Some languages have official bodies that decree how a language works. For example the French have the French Academy. English has no \"boss\" in charge of how the language works and who decides what the correct anything for the language is. The closest are style guides, but they come from multiple organisations and each often different to each other. So, it's harder to just decide that something will be spelt differently. reply prerok 2 hours agorootparentIndeed, that was what I was trying to say, but you put it more accurately. Thanks! reply retrac 1 hour agorootparentprevThe French do something similar, as do the Germans. They've had relatively little luck with substantial changes recently, though. The 1990 French reforms were rather trivial. For example. the placement of the diaeresis was shifted to the first vowel in some digraphs. So \"aiguë\" (acute, sharp) is now \"aigüe\" since it is two syllables, but the former spelling misleadingly hints at three syllables. That one seems to have been well-accepted. Many of the other reforms have been only partially accepted, or explicitly rejected by many speakers. (I don't think I am ever going to get used to \"ognon\" for onion.) reply martyvis 6 hours agorootparentprevMy Mum is an Australian Yvonne and married my Dutch father Jan. When we spent a whole year in the Netherlands back in 1971, Dutch acquaintances would always pronounce her name something like Yuh-vonna, quite different to how in English it is said like Ee-vonn. (My Dad's name is pronounced like Yun of course) And yes as a 7 year old Aussie it was interesting learning that the digram \"ij\" was the 25th letter on the Dutch alphabet reply breakingcups 5 hours agorootparentI know several Yvonne's and we'd all pronounce it Ee-vonna. reply wirrbel 6 hours agoparentprevA local theme park as a \"dutch quarter\" and I as a kid was always fascinated by one booth having a letter \"ÿ\" in the name. I later learned that it was some kind of alternativ spelling for ij, and if you spell ij in black letters its really easy to see why that might have occured. reply thequux 2 hours agorootparentIt's also quite common in handwriting; ĳ in cursive looks exactly like ÿ, and even when the letters aren't all joined, that is a common ligature. When I studied Flemish as part of the integration course, all of the teachers wrote ÿ, and so I presumed that it was just the done thing. reply jetrink 8 hours agoparentprevVery interesting. An example that users of this forum will be familiar with is Edsger Dijkstra. reply segfaltnh 6 hours agorootparentDoes this mean the correct pronunciation is \"deekstra\"? reply dep_b 2 hours agorootparentIt’s more like dye-kstra. But that would still be wrong. It’s a sound that doesn’t exist in English. Daikstra - you can pronounce this Dijkstra - a sound in between you cannot pronounce coming from English Diekstra - you can pronounce this too reply samatman 2 hours agorootparentIn IPA, the name is /dɛikstra/. Americans (English vowels vary quite extremely by dialect/accent, so I'm sticking with Standard American English) can easily pronounce ɛ, we say the word 'bed' as /bɛd/. But the 'ɛi' is a dipthong, and we don't have that dipthong. We have aɪ, as in 'bride' /bɹaɪd/, which is what usually comes out, at least for those of us who know that /dʒɪkstɹə/ is not even close to right. What you'll hear is generally something like /daɪkstɹə/, which make sense, as we pronounce 'dike' /daɪk/ as well. So yes, completely correct, I just wanted to add the IPA for clarity. reply BalinKing 2 hours agorootparentTo my understanding, most American and British English dialects[0] have /eɪ/, e.g. in \"maze\", which I imagine is quite close to /ɛi/. [0] The exceptions being dialects where it monophthongizes to /eː/ reply tomsmeding 44 minutes agorootparentDutch /e/ has the tendency to become /eɪ/ as well (not in Flemish, I think), so /eɪ/ just sounds mostly like \"e\" to us (Dutch speakers in NL). The \"ij\" is really /ɛɪ/, but because we don't really have /aɪ/, it turns out that /aɪ/ works fine as a fairly non-ambiguous substitute. reply _a_a_a_ 1 hour agorootparentprev\"monophthongizes\" Heck of a word is that. reply BalinKing 1 hour agorootparenthey, I don't make the rules :-P https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophthongization reply wirrbel 6 hours agorootparentprevno, daykstra.

The \"j\" instead of \"i\" prevents you from adding another 1 or 2 to the number, at most. Meanwhile, you could still change \"ii\" to \"vii\" or \"xii\" or \"lxii\" or whatever on the left side. And still often append \"i\" on the right side when it doesn't end in \"j\" -- \"x\" can still become \"xj\", \"xij\", \"xvij\", etc. It's just funny that you'd bother at all with \"j\" when it achieves so little. I see that it was also a practice to draw a line over the number -- why not just draw a whole box around it? reply yencabulator 2 hours agoparentMy theory #1: It's not protection against forgery, it's protection against accidental misreads. It's less likely a random smear looks like an \"x\" of \"v\" than an \"i\", so they don't really benefit from the terminal marker. And \"i\" can never start a large roman numeral, so just a terminal marker is fine. Theory #2: It didn't start as such protection. It started as a typographical convention -- remember, there was a time when \"i\" and \"j\" weren't separate letters, \"u\" and \"v\" were not separate letters, and so on -- which then people started using as a reading guide. reply strken 3 hours agoparentprevThe source from the article doesn't sound like it's a measure against tampering, but instead a way to stop the patient receiving the wrong dose by accident. Prior to the early 1900s I'm pretty sure you could buy cocaine and opium over the counter in most of the English-speaking world, so there wouldn't have been any reason to alter your prescription.

I have long been puzzled by how its romanization became „ss“. In older writing ‘s’ was just the terminal form of ‘ſ’ — if you needed two you just wrote ſſ, same as in English into the early 19th century. Other ligatures like tz and ch did not survive the jump into Roman letterforms, only ß for some reason. By the way the now obsolete dual letterforms of s (ſ/s) was inherited from Greek. We’re lucky it was still in use in Leibniz’s time or calculus notation would be more confusing! reply canjobear 30 minutes agorootparentNot only the romanization, also the capital form in German is SS. The ß sticks around in German because it prevents some ambiguities. For example Busse and Buße are different words with different pronunciations. Basically German orthography backed itself into a corner because of two rules: a vowel before a doubled consonant is short, and an s before a vowel is pronounced /z/. This leaves you with no clear way to write a long vowel followed by an /s/ sound followed by a vowel: VssV would make the first vowel short, and VsV would keep the first vowel long but the consonant would be pronounced as /z/. The ß solves this problem. reply NeoTar 15 minutes agorootparent> The ß sticks around in German Some German. I believe it’s basically abandoned in Swiss German. reply peterfirefly 3 hours agorootparentprevThere were ligatures for both ss and sz. The name for the sz survived for both. The modern eszett glyph usually looks like an ss ligature (long s + short s). reply kazinator 3 hours agoprevI don't understand why it's clear that xx is terminated, but not clear that iii is terminated, requiring the last i to be a j. (Furthermore, if you have additional syntax on it like a superscript th, why is the j still needed then. That's a pure onion in the varnish at that point; someone just using the j without thinking about its purpose and necessity.) reply mannykannot 5 hours agoprevSo you should interpret xvij as 17, not 16. It's part of the number, not something appended. The original off-by-one error? reply asveikau 5 hours agoparentNo, it's because the letter J came about in the 4th century AD to cover the consonant version of I in Latin.

I'm not certain about the etymology, but many languages do use an \"i\" sound for the names of June and July.

I don’t know much about the precise evolution, but g → y strikes me as a perfectly normal sound change, especially before /e/. Looks like it happened in the other Romance languages too: compare French roi, Portuguese rei, Italian re, etc. reply satiric 9 hours agorootparentAnd in English as well. German \"tag\" (as in \"guten tag\"), to Old English \"daeg\" (with the g pronounced as a y), to Middle English \"day\". reply vidarh 8 hours agorootparentIn that case, German switched to \"t\", not English from. High German is the main odd one out of the Germanic languages in this case. Compare \"Dag\" (low German)\"; Saterland Frisian \"Dai\"; West Frisian \"dei\"; \"dag\" in Old Saxon, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish); Faroese and Icelandic \"dagur\"; Gothic \"dags\" d -> t is one of the major High German consonant shifts. Other examples of the d -> t shift is Vater vs. vader, fader, father (from Middle English \"fader\", so there the \"th\" in modern English is also not from the German) Others prominent changes around the same time included e.g. p -> ff (Schiff vs. ship, schip, ship, skip, skib in other Germanic languages) and /t/ -> /t:s/ etc. - compare Zwei with two, to, två in other Germanic languages. Very few of those changes made it into English, either Old English at the time, or later - English in that respect tends to be closer to Low German than to current standard German. (as an English speaker - or a speaker of basically any other Germanic language -, to learn German having a rough idea about the consonant shift is a major help in figuring out German vocabulary - you'll find a lot more German words are \"close enough\" to be understandable once you recognise the changed sounds) reply yawboakye 8 hours agorootparentprevcorrection: spanish is heavily ablative case instead of accusative. original statement is correct in principle since lex, rex are nominative and first in a nominative-genetive form in latin dictionaries. eg. lex, legis. rex, regis. reply switch007 4 hours agorootparent> spanish is heavily ablative case instead of accusative Is it?

Got any other examples of ablative in Spanish? reply asveikau 4 hours agorootparentprevX in Mexico or Quixote used to be pronounced as \"sh\". I think X is still used for that sound in Portuguese or Basque or Catalan if I'm not mistaken. In the case of Mexico they were transcribing a word from indigenous people. In a bunch of Spanish words coming from Latin, it was often from Latin double S. Eg. páxaro, from Vulgar Latin passarum. I can also think of cases of this sound coming from Arabic, eg. modern ojalá was once oxala which is a cognate with \"inshallah\", note the sh sound. Sometime around the 1500s this sound changed to /x/ and they changed spellings of a few different sounds whose values had shifted over the centuries. X had merged with a sound they spelled with J, derived from Latin words with J in them. reply asveikau 4 hours agoparentprevI think Old Spanish had i in some of those. Like rei. Or i meaning and. reply create-account 3 hours agorootparentOld Spanish was probably closer to the real pronunciation and had also more variety, depending on the whim of the scribe. Most of the greatest works ever written in Spanish are prior to the standardisation by the RAE at the end of the 18th century, indeed reply asveikau 1 hour agorootparentI don't know. An /i/ near a vowel in Spanish tends to become /j/. I usually see the consonant y transcribed as [ʝ]. Wikipedia on Spanish phonology notes the difference in pronunciation between viuda and ayuda which is an interesting contrast in two very similar sounding words. Old Spanish had a lot of phonological differences so I'm not sure you can do a straight comparison. reply DonHopkins 9 hours agoparentprevAnd the Dutch digraph/ligature \"ij\" is like \"y\" with an umlaut. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IJ_(digraph) reply JW_00000 9 hours agorootparent> IJ probably developed out of ii, representing a long [iː] sound [...]. In the Middle Ages, the i was written without a dot in handwriting, and the combination ıı was often confused with u. Therefore, the second i was elongated: ıȷ. Later, the dots were added, albeit not in Afrikaans, a language that has its roots in Dutch. In this language y is used instead. > Alternatively, the letter J may have developed as a swash form of i. In other European languages it was first used for the final i in Roman numerals when there was more than one i in a row, such as iij for \"three\", to prevent the fraudulent addition of an extra i to change the number. In Dutch, which had a native ii, the \"final i in a row elongated\" rule was applied as well, leading to ij. > Another theory is that IJ might have arisen from the lowercase y being split into two strokes in handwriting. At some time in the 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ij. An argument against this theory is that even in handwriting which does not join letters, ij is often written as a single sign. So indeed maybe the same as the Roman numerals. Interesting, I didn't know this. (Also interesting that no one really knows where this letter came from.) reply gumby 5 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn’t undergo the phonetic process of umlaut, Don, and as it’s a vowel the two dots are more like a simple diaeresis.

The i-dots and t-crosses are two typical elements that can't be written without lifting the pen, so it's quite a frequent thing to put pen to paper, write out a word that includes i and t but leave them unfinished so you can continue the rest of the letters in one fluid motion, then go back and finish them off by dotting and crossing them.

If I'm prescribed a course of something for 90 days, I will get 90 pills, even if the packs have 100. It might differ by location, but here (I'm in the UK), it's not unusual to e.g. get 14 pills of antibiotics if prescribed a two week course even if the package is in units of 10, for example. reply rileymat2 3 hours agorootparentprevProbably depends, my prescriptions seem to be 90 days. reply kseistrup 8 hours agorootparentprevI never claimed it was impossible, just more difficult. Prevention of misreading is more important thar prevention of forgeries, I assume, and any misread og forged number would also have to match existing packaging sizes. reply vidarh 7 hours agorootparentAdding a c is hardly more difficult than adding a 0. Matching packaging sizes is not necessary - I have had prescriptions that do not match packaging sizes many times - they will cut up sheets or transfer to other containers as needed. reply Anarch157a 6 hours agorootparentThat's not universal. In my country, prescription medicine can only be sold in sealed boxes. Fractioning or tranfering to a different container is expressly forbidwn by law, so doctors always prescribe a number of boxes, not of pills. This makes a little more difficult to forge prescriptions. reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparentIf it's prescribed as number of boxes it changes nothing, as it's then just the number of boxes you need to alter instead of number of pills. reply 8372049 5 hours agorootparentprevThis applies to the entire EU/EEA, too. reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparentThat must be recent, as it certainly was not the norm in the UK even prior to Brexit. For some medicines, UK pharmacists are required to split packs as needed to give exactly the number of pills prescribed. I can't find anything to suggest EU rules prevents split packs - I do see there was a tightening of the rules on how to treat packs if dispensing split backs a few years ago, but nothing since. Do you have a source? EDIT: At least as late as per the False Medicines Directive going into force in 2019, split pack dispensing was explicitly allowed - the FMD set out rules for the controls required to do so. E.g. the original container can not leave the dispensary until its entire content is used, and the pharmacy can't re-sell or supply other pharmacies with it. reply inkyoto 5 hours agorootparentprevThe cited text has an extra detail: «… and it is customary to draw a line above all the letters making up the number, the dots of i and j being put above this line; for example, xviij» So, XVIII would have been written likes this: _____ XVIII ----- Lines would clearly delineate the beginning and the end of the number. This is how I have written the Roman numerals since school. So, if the script had X written that way, adding a C, would have also required both lines to be extended. Not impossible to forge, but an extra effort nevertheless. reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentExtending a straight line sounds like the easiest part of the process compared to reproducing a letter so that it matches the handwriting.

I think this way it is difficult to add more Roman digits like x to fake a higher amount than prescribed. The letter j seems to be an additional security because i as a letter is narrow and one could perhaps squash in one or two more i's. The instruction also mentions that the number of dots is important, if the number of i and j is not the same as the number of dots above the line, the apothecary should assume an error. reply kremi 9 hours agorootparentChecks are quite foolproof too - spelling out the number (a hundred eighty eight) and writing the number (188), like on checks.

For that and other reasons, I want to see if y'all would be willing to throw some money my way. If everyone reading this gave $3 a month, we could probably buy Jimbo Wales a nice lunch or something. I do not intend to paywall anything that I post here. Instead, I'm going to take some of the things that tend to be very long Mastodon threads (how this article originally started!) and send them out to supporters, probably about once a month. They'll be things that I wouldn't post here, usually because they're too short or don't quite have a hook to make a while article interesting. So consider supporting me on ko-fi---or don't, it's your decision, and I respect that. I'll probably work a plug into each article but I promise not to be annoying about it. I'm also going to be making some new YouTube videos and I'll probably make those available to supporters first, so that's something else to look forward to. Speaking of annoying, this is kind of a long and dry one. I started looking into something called HICS after visiting a historic site, posted about it a bit on Mastodon, realized that there just wasn't a lot of good historic information about it in general. And I felt like if I was going to talk about communications in Minuteman missile fields, I also had to cover how they would get their war orders. Look on the bright side: it's got pictures! Minuteman Missiles Since the early days of the Cold War, the United States has maintained a nuclear triad: independent capabilities to deliver nuclear weapons from land, sea, and air. The sea and air components are straightforward, consisting of submarines carrying submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and long-range strategic bombers. The land leg is more often forgotten: the intercontinental ballistic missiles, or ICBMs. The US ICBM arsenal currently consists of 400 Minuteman III missiles emplaced throughout the midwest: the Air Force's 90th Missile Wing, 150 missiles, Wyoming Nebraska, and Colorado; the 91st Missile Wing, 150 missiles, in North Dakota; and the 341st Missile Wing, 100 missiles, in Montana. Historically, there were as many as 1,000 active Minuteman missiles, to say nothing of retired missile programs like Titan and Atlas. At least three Minuteman missile facilities are now historic sites open to the public, a somewhat incongruous experience considering their broad similarity to the facilities still in active use. Many others are abandoned, typically in various states of permanent destruction to satisfy treaty obligations. Fifty Minuteman IIIs of the 341st are currently held in an inactive \"reserve\" state, out of service but ready for future emplacement, a notable situation given the strict limits Cold War treaties place on stockpiled ICBMs. Minuteman employed a significantly different launch configuration from earlier ICBM programs. Large facilities were difficult to protect from a first strike; distance was the only effective protection from increasingly accurate Soviet weapons. Scattered single facilities were difficult and costly to staff. Minuteman selected a compromise point: clusters of ten independent Launch Facilities (LFs), spaced miles apart and called a \"flight,\" are remotely monitored and operated from a single Missile Alert Facility (MAF). Groups of four to five missile flights constitute a squadron, and about four squadrons compose a wing, which is supported by an Air Force Base. In each Missile Alert Facility, a Missile Combat Crew Commander (MCCC) and Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander (DMCCC) lock themselves into an underground capsule called a Launch Control Center (LCC) for each 24 hour watch. Originally designed by Boeing, the LCC resembles the interior of an aircraft more than a building, fitting its crew of Air Force officers. The LCC is an isolated, self-contained system with all of the equipment needed to monitor, configure, and launch the missiles. A surface building above contains a security control center and quarters for the security force, responsible not only for the MAF but also for the ten LFs under its supervision. Still, the surface building is both powerless over and largely unneeded by the LCC beneath it. In the event of nuclear war, it was assumed, surface structures in these sparsely populated but strategically critical parts of the country would be wiped cleanly away from the earth. Only the hardened infrastructure would remain: the LCCs, the LFs, and communications infrastructure. Minuteman missile combat crews had more duties than just to wait. They performed remote tests on the missiles, launch, and control equipment; they monitored alarm systems that reported malfunctions and remotely supervised the work of maintenance crews; and they monitored the security systems that protected the unmanned LFs, authorizing access and dispatching security forces on the surface to any unknown intrusion. Still, their primary responsibility, the one for which we all know them, is the disposition of Emergency War Orders (EWO). In fine Air Force tradition, actions that may very well presage the end of the world as we know it are presented in the form of a checklist. EWOs are authenticated against codes and secrets. Two keys, just like in the movies, are inserted. The missiles are enabled by remote command. Targeting information is transmitted to the missiles. The keys are turned, the launch code sent, and the rest is automated, under the control of the missiles themselves. The missile crew are miles away, so the Real Thing, the Shit Hitting the Fan, must feel pretty anticlimactic. The only apocalyptic horsemen they'll see are a series of indicator lights on the MCCC's console: LCH CMD. LCH IN PROC. MISSILE AWAY. The realities of ICBM operation are fascinating and incline one towards drama. Somehow the work of submarine and bomber crews seems more ordinary; they are at least \"out there,\" in or near enemy territory. Missile crews are sealed in a very small room buried below a small building in a corner cut out of a farm field near, but not too near, to a highway for logistical convenience. They are entirely dependent on electronic communications, not only to receive their orders, but even to use their weapons. They have the original email job: since 1962, they have served primarily to send and receive messages, mostly by text. With the rather purple introduction complete, I am going to talk about this communications technology. But first, just a little more preface. Most of the reduction of the Minuteman force has been a direct response to treaties, which imposed progressively lower caps on the nuclear stockpile. Some reductions were more of a historical accident. In the 1980s, political considerations lead to a decision to \"temporarily\" deploy the Peacekeeper missile, with 10 MIRV (multiple independent reentry vehicle) warheads, to a set of fifty silos of the 90th Missile Wing's 400th Missile Squadron, in Wyoming. The Peacekeeper, fielded late in the Cold War, was a profoundly controversial program. The fifty Peacekeepers retrofitted into Minuteman silos would be the only ever installed, and their temporary homes became permanent. Most of the missile's warheads were removed for compliance with Start II treaty, which Russia never ratified and the United States withdrew from. Still, for cost-savings reasons, the odd-duck Peacekeeper program was terminated. The last Peacekeeper missiles were retired in 2005. I got it into my head to write a detailed description of the missile field communications system because of my visit to QUEBEC-01, one of the five MAFs associated with these Peacekeeper missiles, and now a Wyoming State Historical Site. For that reason, I will most closely describe the communications system as installed in the 90th Missile Wing, the remainder of which is still active today. Minuteman missile fields were built over a period of years by different contractors and have since been through multiple modernization programs. Each change has introduced inconsistencies. While I will point out some of the more interesting variations between Minuteman installations, this is best taken as a description of the \"average\" Minuteman squadron, one that is typical of the others but does not exactly exist. Although I am not exactly aiming for academic rigor, this information is based mostly on documents available through the Defense Technical Information Center, which include both original documentation from the Minuteman program and more recent documents related to modernization programs, proposed changes, and the retirement of many Minuteman facilities. I have supplemented those documents with recollections by former Air Force personnel when available, and as always, I welcome any corrections or additional information. One of the pleasures of writing about military history is the tendency of veterans to reach out to me with corrections and stories; I apologize that I am not always good about getting back to people, particularly phone calls. The Minuteman III, a fairly direct evolution of the original Minuteman design, is still in active service. Many detailed materials about the Minuteman program are probably currently classified, most of the others are formerly classified and thus have not consistently made their way to archives. Certain basic questions remain frustratingly unanswered. That's just how it goes. I'm also going to try really hard not to be too annoying with the acronyms, but it's not easy. Personnel While there were originally three-person crews, Minuteman LCCs have had two crew members for many decades, the MCCC and DMCCC. The MCCC is superior to the DMCCC, but the nature of missile operations and such a small crew mean that their roles are somewhat more complex than commander and deputy. Missile crews operate according to the \"two-person concept,\" a general prohibition on any person working alone. This rule is intended to improve safety, reduce mistakes, and most importantly, mitigate the risk of an unauthorized launch. There are additional safeguards against unauthorized launch in the Minuteman system which will be discussed later. Both the MCCC and the DMCCC are required to initiate a launch. The MCCC sits at a console that is focused around monitoring and control of the launch facilities. They have ready access to procedures and documentation. The DMCCC sits at a separate console that is focused on communications. Their chair slides on rails, allowing them to access the equipment racks and teleprinters to the sides of the DMCCC position. The DMCCC is primarily responsible for communications, so we are most interested in the equipment under their control. Missile Alert Facilities were designed with a goal of self-containment for survivability. Most communications equipment is within the LCC itself, readily available to the DMCCC so that they can at least diagnose problems, if not make a repair. To this end, DMCCCs receive significant training on technical details of the communications and computer systems. Should a problem occur outside of the LCC, the MCC would request assistance from the Air Force Base. Several Air Force ratings had expertise in communications equipment, ranging from communications technicians that would investigate problems within the LF to cable splicers that would repair damage in the outside plant. The Minuteman program is somewhat unusual in the extensive construction of long-distance communications equipment by the Air Force. AT&T's role in the missile fields was surprisingly limited; most communications followed routes fully under the control of the Air Force. External Communications We can generally divide Minuteman communications systems into two categories: external and internal. External communications systems are primarily used by the Missile Combat Crew (MCC) to receive orders, including Emergency War Orders authorizing the use of nuclear weapons. Internal communications systems are used within the missile field, primarily to allow the MCC to communicate with the launch facilities under their control. Some details blur the lines: for example, there are communications systems which allow the MCC to contact their Air Force Base, where support facilities and maintenance crews are found. I will consider these internal systems, but you could argue for the opposite. The external communications systems available to Minuteman crews have varied over time. Perhaps the most exotic was the Survivable Low Frequency Communications System (SLFCS), based on the LF equipment used by the Navy for communications with submarines. Missile facilities are not underwater, but nuclear detonations cause significant disruption to the atmosphere that greatly interferes with radio propagation in the HF range. LF communications are expected to be less affected in a nuclear combat environment. SLFCS specifically operated between 14kHz and 60kHz. Some, but not all, Minuteman MAFs were equipped with a magnetic loop antenna, about 6' in diameter, buried shallowly underground. All MAFs were equipped with HF antennas, although they were decommissioned in the 1980s. The HF antennas are described as hardened, but it is not feasible to truly harden an HF antenna. They must be fairly large, and HF does not penetrate the ground well, making it impractical to bury them. Instead, hardened HF antennas are perhaps better described as \"hidden\" HF antennas. The typical design is a monopole that stores in a long, narrow silo underground, awaiting post-attack deployment. MAFs had two separate hardened HF antennas, one for transmit, and one for receive. The receive antenna was the most critical, as it would be needed to receive war orders over the High Frequency Global Communications System (HFGCS). HFGCS is one of the primary ways that an Emergency War Order would be distributed to Air Force units including both missiles and bombers. The hardened HF receive antenna assembly actually included six 160' monopoles: one was extended for normal use, but in the event of nuclear attack, the five others were stored telescoped in a silo about 30' deep and could be deployed by a small explosive charge. There were, in the parlance apparently used by the Air Force, five \"reloads.\" The HF transmit antenna, being less important in an attack scenario, had only one replacement. A \"soft\" HF transmit antenna of conventional design was in normal use but backed up by a single 120' hardened antenna stored in a separate silo. A 50' radius buried ground plane surrounded the hardened antenna. Near the MAF surface building, a small, white metal cone protrudes from the ground. The cone consists of a huge cast steel blast deflector with a depression in the center, which is covered by a fiberglass cone. The cone houses a compact UHF antenna. This antenna, a 1970s upgrade, can receive war orders via several satellite systems or directly from an aircraft such as the E-6. The E-6 airborne command post can serve in various roles, including as a \"Looking Glass\" airborne command post (taking control of nuclear forces in the event of a loss of ground-based command posts) or a \"TACAMO\" Take Charge and Move Out relay, transmitting a war order from elsewhere to forces in the field. UHF communications are essentially line of sight, especially with the use of a partially in-ground hardened antenna. In a scenario with extensive loss of communications infrastructure, particularly with ASAT warfare disabling military communications satellites, an E-6 or another similarly equipped aircraft would fly over Minuteman missile fields and deliver an emergency war order directly to each LCC. Complimenting this capability, in-service Minuteman launch facilities have themselves been equipped with a similar UHF antenna. Looking Glass and TACAMO aircraft actually have Air Force missileers on board who serve as an Airborne Launch Control Center (ALCC). In the event of a loss of most of the LCCs in a missile field, an ALCC can issue launch instructions directly to each LF without any need for the regular missile crews or internal communications infrastructure. During the early '90s, a super high frequency (SHF) small satellite terminal was installed at each active MAF. It is housed in a small, white radome at the top of a pole near the surface building. SHF is widely used by modern military satellite systems, such as the Air Force's Wideband Global SATCOM. Each of these antennas is connected by buried conduits to radio equipment in the LCC's radio racks. At the DMCCC's position, the telephone console allows the DMCCC to talk or listen on each radio by selecting it with a pushbutton. Over time, the radios were also attached to more modern digital systems. Depending on the year, teleprinters or computer displays would receive text messages via the UHF and SHF radio systems. The external radio systems were actually all backup or secondary. The primary means of nuclear C2 within the Strategic Air Command and, later, Global Strike Command, has long been a digital computer network. While Minuteman installations began with just a teleprinter to receive orders via leased telephone line, the late '60s saw the introduction of the Strategic Automated Command and Control System (SACCS), which was itself replaced by the Strategic Air Command Digital Network (SACDIN). A small (for the era) computer in a rack to the right of the DMCCC's station allowed two-way messaging with SAC headquarters over leased telephone lines. Reportedly, these and other Bell System telephone lines to LCCs were carried by buried telephone cable to small hardened exchange buildings serving each missile field. I have not yet researched this topic closely. In Peacekeeper LCCs as well as Minuteman LCCs from the '70s to the '90s, the specific computer used for this purpose was called the Command Data Buffer (CDB). The CDB was connected to both SACCS/SACDIN and the internal communications network, in order to accurately relay targeting information to the missiles. This will be discussed later in the context of rapid retargeting. In the 1990s, the REACT system was installed for a similar purpose. Quebec-01 LCC was equipped with a teleprinter with a selector between SACDIN and AFSAT (UHF satellite) receivers. I'm not sure why the teleprinter was retained after the CDB upgrade, very possibly just for redundancy. Somewhere between external and internal, each LCC had access to two dial telephone lines. These connected directly to the PSTN. Some circumstantial evidence leads me to think these dial lines were shared with the surface building, which probably explains the need for two. The dial lines were mostly used to contact support crews at the Air Force Base for routine maintenance issues. HICS Digital Communications I was most interested in the internal communications systems, which have garnered less historical documentation than the external links. In most cases, there is only really one: the Hardened Intersite Cable System, HICS. HICS consists of multipair pressurized telephone cables trenched between Minuteman facilities. HICS carries digital traffic for C2, and many Air Force documents use the term \"HICS\" exclusively to mean the digital channel, but the same cables carried multiple voice pairs. Let's consider the digital capability first, though. HICS, as originally installed, operated at 1.3Kbps. Details on the actual encoding are hard to come by, but given the time period I assume it was generally similar to the AFSK schemes used by other early telephone data links. The punch line, of course, is that the 1.3Kbps stuck---based on some Air Force journal articles on options for upgrades, it seems that contemporary Minuteman III fields still communicate over HICS at 1.3Kbps. Remember that when we get to retargeting. The topology of the digital HICS network is rather interesting. It was designed for redundancy and reliability, but prior to most of our modern understanding of computer networking. There's a mix of a few different ideas. One of the things I'm not completely confident of is the size of the collision domain within HICS, or how much of the cable network was a common bus. From reading between the lines of some different reports and considering the overall design, I'm fairly confident that the entire digital HICS network was a single shared bus within each flight, and I think it is likely that it was a shared bus within each squadron. This bus would be tens of miles long with multiple branches, a challenging electrical situation that perhaps explains why the Air Force has repeatedly found it to be infeasible to make HICS faster. Thanks to minutemanmissile.com for this image of the Warren AFB/90th Missile Wing HICS map, which is far more legible than the photo I had taken. Each of the LCCs, denoted in the map by open rectangles, is connected to four \"loops\" of HICS cable. The legs of adjacent loops to the LCC are shared, though, so it's perhaps easier to describe this way: each LCC is surrounded by a ring of HICS cable, to which it is connected by four legs spread roughly 90 degrees apart. This design gives a fair amount of redundancy, a break anywhere in the ring or even breaks of more than one of the LCC's legs would still leave a working path. This latter scenario was probably one of the designer's greatest concerns, as the LCCs would be obvious targets for inbound nuclear attacks. The cable layout provides four-times redundancy on the cables to the LCC, but no redundancy at all on the cables to individual LFs. That tells you a lot about their threat modeling. Facilities were spaced far enough apart that a precision strike on an LF would probably disable only that single LF; a precision strike on an LCC, though, could potentially disable ten LFs at once. As the accuracy and power of nuclear warheads improved, it seemed more likely that a first strike would succeed in disabling at least some LCCs. A lot of the complexity of HICS is intended to account for that possibility. Each of the LFs is connected to the ring via a single leg. In some cases, multiple LFs are along the same leg. These are often the same long runs that connect the rings of two different LCCs together. In general, each LCC ring is connected to two of its neighbors, although sometimes it will instead have two redundant connections to a single neighbor. Based on the map and situation on the ground, these inter-flight connections don't seem to have required any active equipment, only a splice case. That supports the theory that an entire squadron was a shared bus, although it's possible that a separate pair to the \"foreign\" LCC ring would home-run to the LCC to allow separately sending messages to either. The network doesn't seem to have that kind of selective routing capability, though, so I find it unlikely. Digital messages do seem to have been packetized, and were distributed through the network on a \"flood fill\" basis. That is, every active node on the digital network repeated every message it received. You might wonder about flow control and the avoidance of cycles; only a very primitive method was used. Each node, after transmitting a message, would \"lock out\" the cable it was transmitted on for a long enough period for the node on the other end to finish repeating the message. This explanation is a little more difficult to understand, though, when applied to the actual layout of the HICS system. What exactly constitutes a node? You will note that the map distinctly shows intersquadron connections, with both thicker lines and open circles where they connect to an LCC ring. My theory is that these intersquadron connections where the only places where active repeating of messages was required. Whether or not repeating messages between squadrons was selective is unclear. Did a message from an LCC to one of its nearby LFs get repeated across squadrons to the opposite end of the field? If repeating had originally been completely non-selective, I suspect that was changed as part of the work done to facilitate retargeting. We can infer certain things about the HICS network from the equipment in Quebec-01. For example, HICS must have had a fair number of active repeaters. along a path. Inside of the LCC, we find something like a tiny long-distance telephone test desk. A rack includes pressurization alarms for five cables (we know of four legs to the LCC ring, is the fifth perhaps a cable to the local telephone exchange?), and a fault isolation panel. When a cable seemed to have been lost, the DMCCC could use this panel to locate the problem along the cable. This probably relied on a loopback test feature of the repeaters, but I'm not sure exactly the operating principle. Further down in the rack is what appears to be a cable power supply. Repeaters were definitely installed inside the LCCs, but the number of selections on this test panel makes me suspect that there were also in-line repeaters on the cable, perhaps taking power from that power supply. This is entirely speculative, but A repeaters may have been located along the LCC ring and B repeaters on legs, making the two-knob selector arrangement useful to test a specific repeater on a specific leg. In the equipment side of the LCC, where the generator and chiller are located, we also find the terminations of the HICS cables. Note the mostly empty rack that would have held repeater equipment, and the air dryer and flow gauges for cable pressurization. Finally, I should talk a bit about the exception to all of this: the 321st Missile Wing, in North Dakota, was built later than the 90th and 91st and by a different contractor. Sylvania, not Boeing, won the bid to build the LCCs and LFs. Much of the equipment is the same, but Sylvania did inject a few of their own ideas, and one of them was radio redundancy for HICS. The 321st apparently had a simplified HICS topology; I'm not sure of the details but I would guess that they may not have provided the four redundant cables to each LCC. To make up for it, each LCC and LF in the 321st is equipped with a large, buried antenna, a grid-like arrangement of crossing dipoles that took up an area similar to the sewage lagoons outside of the fence. These antennas made up a medium-frequency, ground-wave communications network that could be used as an alternative to HICS. The 321sts redundant radio system, apparently called \"Deuce\" at the time, could be viewed as a precursor to the later nationwide GWEN radio C2 network. It seems to have carried the same digital messages as HICS, and the DMCCC had selectors to choose whether messages would be sent by cable or radio. HICS Voice Communications Now, let's take a close look at the DMCCC's communications console, which tells us a lot about the voice capabilities. They get a lot of buttons! There appear to be two separate busses, I'm not completely sure of the significance of that layout. I know from an airman's anecdote that the DMCCCs could conference together LF phones and the dial telephone lines, and sometimes did so that maintenance crews stuck at an LF overnight could make apologies to their families. This makes me think that it is not a matter of \"one selection per bus,\" but rather probably indicates that lines can only be joined within a bus. The logic behind that design is not clear to me. Anyway, let's see if we know enough to explain all of these buttons. Some are easy: for the speaker and handset, there are selectors each of the radios. The \"LF Lines\" correspond to each of the ten LFs, numbered 2-11 since the LCC is numbered as site 1. We see the two dial lines, regular telephone lines provided at each site, and they are even labeled with their phone numbers. The five-digit notation dates this hand-written addition to the 2L-5N era, which probably persisted unusually late in rural Wyoming. The rest of the buttons correspond to specific pairs that would emerge in different places in the HICS network. The \"SCC\" button likely allows communications with the security command center in the surface building, just up the elevator from the LCC. The \"LCC\" button I am less sure of; perhaps it was a party line of other LCCs in the squadron? The \"LCC Ring\" selections must correspond to the four HICS cable rings extending from the LCC, but I'm not sure which devices would be found on those pairs. They may be \"order wires,\" available in the splice boxes and as jacks at sites and normally used only by maintenance crews working on cables outside of the LFs. The EWO buttons are interesting. EWO is, of course, Emergency War Order, but in the context of Minuteman was also the term used for party lines connecting the Air Force Base to the LCCs. These could be used, of course, as a redundant way to deliver EWOs, as well as for general communications across the missile field. There are two for redundancy: one was routed via AT&T infrastructure, following a cable from the LCC to a telephone exchange. The other was routed via HICS. I am not sure why only one merits a \"RNG\" button, that could apply ringing voltage to get the attention of other stations. I am assuming, by the magic of speculation, that the \"OPR\" button on the left of each bus probably selected which bus the headset was connected to. There is also a dial, for use with the dial lines. These voice connections within the field were of critical importance because of Minuteman's strict security posture. The unattended LFs were equipped with intrusion alarms for physical security, initially a bistatic radar system more similar to that used at Titan, and later a DSP-based monostatic radar system called the IMPSS. Any personnel or, reportedly, large rabbits approaching an LF would cause an alarm, and security forces were dispatched to investigate unless the intruder used a HICS voice circuit to authenticate themselves to the LCC. The process of \"penetrating\" a secure LF could take a missile crew thirty minutes or more, and involved multiple calls to the LCC as different alarms were triggered. HICS Outside Plant Old aerial images and historical documents from the Air Force give us some insight into the construction of HICS. HICS cables were installed in open trenches and then covered, rather than placed directly with a vibratory plow as would become common later. Splices were done in large holes with scotch-lok connectors and cast iron splice casings. Over time, many of the splice casings had to be replaced due to premature corrosion, and different materials were tried before settling on brass. A cathodic protection system was installed as a permanent solution to the problem. I have done my best to trace some of the HICS cables along their routes. The holes used for splicing are sometimes visible as scars, but it does not appear that any manholes were installed; instead splices were made near RoW markers and will have to be excavated for repairs. The lack of manholes suggests that there may not be active equipment along the cable routes, I'm not really sure. The RoW markers used by the Air Force are substantially similar to the style used by AT&T at the time. They are round wooden posts, about 6' tall, with metal bands around the top. Unlike AT&T, the Air Force used white bands, and it seems that there are always two. Shorter markers are used in some places, I suspect where there are splice cases not near road crossings. Where the cables cross roads, the Air Force usually installed gates with sturdy metal posts in the roadside fences. Sometimes these gates are the easiest evidence to find in aerial photos. One of my biggest questions is about the inter-squadron relays. The map depicts them as nodes, but they aren't located at LFs or other facilities. I wondered if there might be active equipment, but I found one of the locations where in inter-squadron cable takes off from an LCC ring and there is no indication of even a manhole. In case you might be interested, here is a KML with the cable tracks I have worked out so far. Cross-Flight Communications HICS served primarily to allow an LCC to communicate within the ten missiles in its flight. However, the entire squadron and then the entire missile wing were interconnected, and Minuteman took advantage of this capability for several purposes. First, a specific LCC in each squadron was designated as the Squadron Command Post (SCP). The SCP was capable of sending launch orders to any missile within the squadron, and of countermanding launch orders issued by any of the squadron's LCCs. This provided a measure of protection against a destroyed or compromised LCC. Over time, the security of Minuteman missiles was further enhanced by the addition of a \"vote to launch\" system. Minuteman missiles can only be launched if launch orders are sent by at least two LCCs, requiring a total of four individuals. In some Minuteman fields (and all current fields), a Wing command post serves in a role similar to the SCP but across the entire wing. It provides one central point where the entire wing's missile inventory can be monitored and, if necessary, controlled. Alarms Besides missile C2 and voice communications, one of the main functions of the HICS was the reporting of alarms within unattended LFs to the LCC. Some alarms, particularly related to the missile itself, would be sent by the missile guidance computer over the HICS digital network. These alarms would be printed by the teleprinter below the DMCCC's desk, along with confirmations of commands received and other routine traffic. There was also a second, dedicated alarm system called the Voice Reporting Status Assembly or VRSA. VRSA seems to have relied on its own pairs in the HICS cables, and resembled the simple alarm reporting telephones coming into use by AT&T. The DMCCC could select an LF and press a button to send a tone, which triggered a device at the LF to \"read back\" any status alarms via voice recordings. At the time this almost certainly involved some interesting magnetic tape equipment, but I haven't found much information on the LF end of the VRSA. Toggle switches on the VRSA console allowed the DMCCC to reset the alarm device in the LF, clearing any recorded alarms that weren't active. The VRSA was an upgrade over the original Minuteman installations, which used a very similar panel to send a safe/arm tone to the LFs as part of the launch process. Since part of standard testing practice was for DMCCCs to flip the toggle switch for an LF to remove the \"safe\" tone and arm the site, it was a fairly obvious evolution to have the site report any faults in response to a tone. Reportedly, the VRSA panels were the original safe/arm panels with modifications. Retargeting When Minuteman was originally installed, each missile's targeting data was loaded from tape using equipment in the LF. To retarget a missile, a maintenance crew had to travel to the site, access it, run the new target tape through equipment in the LF that sent the data to the guidance computer, and complete a recalibration of the inertial reference platform in the missile. This was something like a 12-hour process overall, and retargeting a squadron would take weeks. Fixed targets were practical when the \"enemy\" was self-evidently the Soviet Union and any attack would be all-out. Over the 70-year lifespan of the Minuteman program, though, the geopolitical and military environment has changed. There are now other nuclear adversaries, and their military assets are increasingly mobile. The biggest challenge to Minuteman's targeting was the Soviet Union's development of road-mobile ICBMs like the RT-21. To eliminate the USSR's nuclear capability, we would have to fire on these mobile systems wherever they were located. Aerial and satellite surveillance could be surprisingly effective in keeping track of these large, slow-moving TELs, but the Minuteman missiles could not be retargeted to keep up with that intelligence. In response, a series of enhancements were made (often as part of the Minuteman II program) to introduce \"rapid retargeting.\" Rapid retargeting allowed the missiles to be retargeted from within the LCC. During the 1970s, a computer system called the Command Data Buffer (CDB) was installed in each LCC. The CDB could receive targeting parameters from SAC and then transmit them to the LFs. It was theoretically possible to retarget missiles shortly before launch. In practice, the \"shortly\" wasn't very achievable The HICS network was capable of 1.3Kbps, and because of the \"flood\" design of the network, that was essentially 1.3Kbps of total capacity across a single collision domain. In other words, only 1.3Kbps of total traffic could be handled, with far less available from point to point when the network is under heavy use. Further, enhancements to the Minuteman system added cryptographic authentication of messages over HICS and, later, encryption of the messages themselves. The added overhead of the cryptographic system further reduced network capacity. Retargeting a squadron of Minuteman missiles via the CDB took over 20 hours. Retargeting a single missile could take 30 minutes. CDB represented a major step forward in Minuteman C2, particularly with its real-time messaging capability. Retargeting was still a severely limited capability, though. During the 1990s, active Minuteman sites were upgraded to the Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting System, or REACT. More than just an upgrade for retargeting, REACT brought a completely new control system that significantly changed the layout of LCCs. Instead of sitting at opposite ends of the tube, REACT put the MCCC and DMCCC directly alongside each other and centralized almost all control functionality onto computer displays. It also further refined retargeting: retargeting an entire squadron now takes only ten hours. More radically, though, a single missile can be retargeted in only a couple of minutes, making it feasible to retarget a missile just before firing in a limited attack scenario. The future of HICS While both over budget and behind schedule, the Sentinel program is expected to replace the Minuteman missiles. Sentinel will likely be an in-place upgrade, installing new missiles and control systems in the existing Minuteman silos. It has been clear for decades now that HICS isn't capable of meeting modern expectations, so Sentinel will include a complete replacement. Various options including DSL over HICS cables and radio were considered, but the current plan is to trench new fiber-optic cables across the launch fields. They're less interesting, but fiber optic cables have both capacity and reliability advantages over telephone cables, and could easily remain in service for the life of the Sentinel program.",

Similarly, in most attack scenarios the USSR would almost certainly have made a high-altitude detonation over the ICBM fields one of their first moves.

Story time: The airbase I was stationed at in Germany had been built by the French, prior to their partial departure from NATO[1]. There was a buried cable on base that went bad while I was there. It was pressurized but apparently the hole in the casing/jacket was large and admitted more water than could be kept out by the nitrogen. So the airmen of the outside plant had to use their TDR[2] to find the fault and dig it up to repair it. To their surprise it turned out to have paper insulation[3], as it was made before plastic began to be widely used in wiring. It also had swastikas printed on it - because the French had used captured Nazi war-surplus cable when they built the base in the late 1940's.

    "originLink": "https://dgerrells.com/blog/how-not-to-use-box-shadows",
    "originBody": "Home / blog So you think you know box shadows? Box shadows. I love them. Four years ago I found out my m1 can render a stupid number of these bad boys and so I set out to see just how far you can push them and boy did I. If you are looking for a how to use box shadows to get the look of the latest UX trend, this is not the right article for you. But if you like some janky creativity, stay tuned. I want to share some of the worst possible things one can do with box shadows all on a single div. Things which shouldn't work at all yet somehow they do. But before getting into that, a question must be answered. What exactly is a box shadow? Graphic design 101 A box shadow is a kind of drop shadow. And a drop shadow is a kind of image filter that is very popular in graphic design due to how versatile it is at adding an approximation of depth to composition. The filter takes the raster of an image and shifts the pixels along the x and y axis. It will draw these pixels as a single color behind the source image. This gives an illusion of depth by dropping the outline of an image as a \"shadow\" into the composition hence the name drop shadow. We can use the css filter property to see this in action. div { filter: drop-shadow(xOffset yOffset rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)); } There are many different implementations of a drop shadow filter across different tools like photoshop, gimp, figma, and css each having a different set of features. For example css also supports an optional blur value to apply to the drop shadow. div { filter: drop-shadow(xOffset yOffset blurSize rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)); } By layering several drop filters one can easily add interesting depth to a composition. For example, here are 2 layered drop-shadow filters. Nifty. What about box shadows? The Box Shadow A box shadow is a form of drop filter with many trade offs. First, the name \"Box\" has to do with the filter only supporting box shapes. For example, lets try applying it to the previous example. Notice that the shadow shape is limited to the bounding box of the container and how the shadow can break out of the bounding box. This seems limiting but it comes with a few more features one of which is performance. It turns out that the majority of user interfaces are made up of boxes. It also turns out that some smart people figured out maths hacks to draw rounded boxes for super cheap which UI peeps love because with this hack boxes can be so round as to appear as circles. And the css box shadow implementation supports this math hack. This means that designers can be liberal with box shadows rather than relying on prerendered source images bloating download sizes. This little mixer shows the variety of shapes available. Tap to randomize the color. This opens up a all kinds of freedom for UI design. Layering these together can produce amazing results. You can play around with a border editor here. Layering. That is an important word. You can layer or chain many box shadows together on a single div. The above example uses this to set the colors. function randomizeAndColor(e) { randomize(e); const spread = Math.random() > 0.8 ? 2 : 0; const x1 = Math.floor(3 - Math.random() * 6) / (1 + spread); const y1 = Math.floor(3 - Math.random() * 6) / (1 + spread); const y2 = 2 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 4); const blur2 = 8 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 12); e.style.boxShadow = `${x1}px ${y1}px 0px ${spread}px ${getRandomPastelColor()}, 0 ${y2}px ${blur2}px #0006`; } How not to use box shadows Usually, a designer will carefully position squares within other squares with consistent margins, paddings, and typography for optimal accessibility and understandability. Wisely, they further add layered shadows and perhaps a few images to help visually distinguish widget interaction and state. That is all well and good but what we are really working with is a kind of painting api. We can paint an arbitrary number of squares to the screen optionally applying a blur to them. I initially explored this with somme minimal art in an earlier write up. I liked the results. everything changed when the fire nation attacked We are not worthy! Make it so... Beam me up Mmmmmkayy..... dun dum...wooOOoo! Shuffle The config that drives this is pretty simple. const blocks = [ [8, \"#114d33\"], [24, \"#50bbab\"], [28, \"#fcba94\"], [10, \"#eced26\"], // ...other characters ]; ; Now the natural question I am sure you have and I certainly had was, \"can we do more box shadows?\" What about blurring or transparency? How do they impact performance? I whipped up a little visual tool where a giant box shadow is created and set on a div like so. const computedBoxShadow = points.map( ([x, y], i) => `${x}px ${y}px ${getBlur(i, frame)}px ${animatedColor()}` ).join(\",\") //...other code ` myDiv { box-shadow: ${computedBoxShadow}; } ` Animation is handled by setting the box shadow string every 300ms and then letting transition: all prop do the animation. This causes some jank and ended up being slower that setting the box shadow on every frame. The result is an app where you can tap to remix a color palette with a history of the last 10 palettes to the left. Here is an example with 100 box shadows. Tap around. I noticed that applying a blur slowed down the number you could animate which makes sense. However, using a transparent color significantly slowed down the number that can be drawn too which doesn't make as much sense to me. I'd imagine that with hardware today transparency should be somewhat free. The div size also impacts performance which makes me think there is some software rasterizer involved when things are animated. I could look into the source code of browsers but it would be different depending on the js engine. However, I found that if I didn't set any transparency or blur, my m1 laptop could draw buckets of box shadows. Like thousands of them. How to seriously not use box shadows Ok, many box shadows can be drawn. Now what? Well we cannot rotate the box shadows but they can be circles and a circle kinda looks like a ball. So what if I made a bunch of balls that could bounce around? And maybe I can \"fake\" a 3d effect by scaling the size based on a z value. This wouldn't be accurate perspective but would add some 3d depth. This one is pretty simple. Just a big'ol \"gamestate\" updated in a requestAnimationFrame and then set a giant box shadow string on div. You can touch somewhere to pull the balls towards you. The balls are contained to a box and will bounce to stay in frame. Toss a tick function into requestAnimationFrame const tick = (timestamp: number) => { gameState.frame++; gameState.deltaTime = Math.min( (timestamp - gameState.prevFrameStartTime) / 1000, 0.1 ); gameState.prevFrameStartTime = timestamp; update(gameState); render(gameState); winContext._gameFrame = window.requestAnimationFrame(tick); }; Updating the simulation isn't complicated but for the sake of brevity I will use a bit of psudocode. const update: GameFunction = (state) => { for (const ball in state) { updateBall(); containBall(); addFriction(); if (touched) pullToPoint(touchX, touchY); } }; Now rendering is the interesting part. What is going to be run 60 time a second is the following. const render: GameFunction = (state) => { const boxShadowString = state.balls .sort((a, b) => b.z - a.z) .map((ball) => { const zIndexScale = 1 + ball.z / 30; const size = ball.size * zIndexScale; const halfSize = (size - state.renderContainerSize) / 2; const hcs = state.renderContainerSize / 2; return [ ball.x + hcs, \"px \", ball.y + hcs, \"px 0 \", halfSize, \"px \", ball.color, ].join(\"\"); }) .join(\",\"); const renderEl = document.getElementById(\"render\"); if (renderEl) { renderEl.style.boxShadow = boxShadowString; } }; Sort the balls based on z index and fill an array of box shadows. The size calculation is based off of wanting to have x,y,z represent the center of a ball with a radius of size. The z scale is a hack to have some z \"depth\" where the size is scaled based on a fixed ratio. Here are 50 balls. Drag em around and make em bounce on the sides. The 3d scaling works pretty well to give a little bit of depth even if it is total bs. You can notice that when a ball gets close to the \"camera\" at a certain point it is no longer a circle. This is because the box shadow div is too small for the scaling method. Increasing the container size fixes this but a larger container means slower performance. Let's see what happens if the balls can bounce off each other with some good old fashion n^2 collision check. Now, I am only going to reflect the balls velocity on a collision detection which is inaccurate but simple. This is not simulating any real physics interaction. I will also fix the z position to make it 2d so it is easier to see what is happening. Not very interesting. I think something more accurate physics would look nicer but maybe another time. Adding a phone gyro as input to this could be fun too but again maybe another time. I reproduced another setup where the balls always try and find their way home to a random starting position. The force of a touch is enough to pull them away however. This give an effect almost like a sponge where you can pull bits off. I can think of ways this could be used for some foam spray in fake fluid sim as part of a game or something. Kind of fun. I noticed that the fake 3d really comes out in the above example as the balls slowly travel back home. How could the 3d aspect be taken further? Maybe I could draw point clouds with the box shadows as points? I could project points on difference surfaces and then draw the points like some godawful 3d renderer. I thought a good starting point would be to simply map pixels from a picture as points on a 2d plane. This would also be a good stress test to find out what the upper limit is on number of realtime simulated box shadows. Here is the mapping function. const pixels = await getImagePixels( \"/images/starry_night_full.jpg\" as any, width ); const dx = window.innerWidth / pixels[0].length; const dy = window.innerHeight / pixels.length; for (let y = 0; y{ const zIndexScale = 1 + coord.z / 40; const size = p.size * zIndexScale; const halfSize = (size - state.renderContainerSize) / 2; const hcs = state.renderContainerSize / 2; const lightDist = Math.sqrt(dist(coord, lightPos)); const intensity = (1 - lightDist / 900) * 1; // I have no idea what i was doing here. const lumen = Math.min(2, (1 / lightDist ** 2) * 60000); return [ coord.x + hcs, \"px \", coord.y + hcs, \"px 0 \", halfSize, \"px \", darkenHexColor(p.color, lumen), ].join(\"\"); }) I used gypity to give me a function to do the cube particle mapping among a few other math helpers. Sometimes gypity-g would work but sometimes it wouldn't and I have to stop being lazy. More on this later... The first function gyptiy gave was a random distribution which I didn't want. I wanted a uniform placement of points across the surface of a uniform sized cube. It was able to get this on the second try. export function getCubeSurfacePoints( cubeSideLength: number, numberOfPoints: number ) { const points = new Map(); const halfSideLength = Math.floor(cubeSideLength / 2); const facePointSpacing = Math.floor( cubeSideLength / Math.sqrt(numberOfPoints) ); const addPoint = (x, y, z) => { const key = `${x}, ${y}, ${z}`; points.set(key, { x, y, z }); }; // Generate points on each face of the cube for (let i = -halfSideLength; i , bounces = 3): THREE.Color { const acc = new Color(AMB_COLOR); const col = new Color(1, 1, 1); for (let i = 0; icontinueProbability) { break; } col .multiply(hit.object.material.color) .multiplyScalar(1 / continueProbability); if (hit.object.material.emissiveStrength > 0) { break; } } return acc; } I am going to stay high level here. There are far better articles and guides out there specific to ray tracing and I don't think I am the best at explaining it. It can get deep and math heavy very fast. Here is a good starting places if you are interested. The general idea is to bounce rays around a scene of objects until a light is hit and then return the computed color based on the object and light properties. Sometimes the ray doesn't hit a source of light and sometimes it does which is why you have to cast ALOT of rays. This tracer is using a pretty simple lighting model. No physically accurate BRDFs here. No textures. No sub surface scattering. Simple diffused with specular reflections. I got planes working but did make the mistake of bit fiddling with floating point numbers for some reason. Nothing to see here. Once that was fixed I could render light squares which make it easier to build well lit scenes. Here is an example of a plane of light outside with no sun. You can tell how rare it is for a ray to hit a light source without stuff to bounce off of. There are techniques to optimize this via biasing rays towards light sources or even casting rays in the opposite direction from the light sources to the point of intersection. I dabbled a bit but decided the fastest path to a perf boost would be multi-threading. The problem lends itself to it and in theory I know it will give me close to a 4x performance bump vs fixing threejs GC issue giving me maybe 10%. Web Workers Web workers are how you multi thread in js. Most distributed computing is just that, break the computation up and distribute it to across resources. Once, all the resources are done computing, gather up the results. Ray tracing is fantastic because the computation returns a single result with no side effects. I setup some worker manager code which creates a pool of workers. It has two methods render and an updateScene so we can swap scenes at runtime. The worker code is a copy and paste of the tracer before with some tedious data marshalling for scene swapping. The post message api is a little awkward but doable. Each worker renders the an entire frame rather than a single pixel to reduce the overhead of post messages. The result is both exciting and disappointing. You can spin up a full screen version here. Cornell Box Cornell Red OnlySpheres Amateur hour more pixels less pixels bigger pixels smaller pixels The exciting part is that it is significantly faster than before. Here is one cranked up a bit. The downside is that when interacting the screen is black. Why is that? Well, anytime the camera or scene change all the previously calculated rays are invalid so they are thrown out. This happens on the main thread in the event handler. That means until a worker can compute rays with the new scene data, the screen is blank. Fixing was a bit tricky to solve at first but the solution is simple. The event handler sets a isDirty flag which is then used in the update loop to know if the frame needs to be wiped or not. This makes things significantly smoother but not perfect. // fired on input event const reset = () => { gameState.isDirty = true; gameState.isDirtyInput = true; gameState.lastDirty = Date.now(); }; // in worker render if (lastFrameTime < state.lastDirty) { lastFrameTime = Date.now(); } else { if (state.dirty) { state.dirty = false; state.frame = 1; } // send worker msgs } There is a case where the main thread can get a frame from a worker right after updating scene data. The frame the worker sent is for the previous scene data. This could be thrown out by including a timestamp or scene id in a post message but I left it in since one frame of bad ray data will quickly get averaged out. The goal is to ray trace with box shadows which is dumb. I am ok if the tracing code is a bit dumb too. The result works well enough though. Here is the original codesandbox if you want the source code. Cornell Box Cornell Disco OnlySpheres Amateur hour The Garage less pixels more pixels smaller pixels bigger pixels toggle gi This is much better. I added another scene too along with some performance stats. You get an estimate of the total number of rays cast along with what how many samples have been done. It stops after 1200 but it is configurable. The rendered resolution is also displayed. You can also toggle to an alternative lighting model. It is faster but is less accurate due to introducing lighting bias. Scene data is json so pretty easy to play around with. This certainly could be improved. Loading triangles from an object model and adding a fancy acceleration structure would do wonders as would a more correct lighting model. But, I am happy with this result. You can in fact ray trace with box shadows. ok, but why? I used a decent bit of the old gypity in this. One thing that bothers me to this day is how it answers this query. It says it isn't possible. But it is! I gave it some more hints. Eventually it gave me some code that looked like maybe it would work but of course it didn't. It wasn't a fair ask because gypity can only spit out what it has seen on the internet and I don't know if the internet has seen this yet. Well, now the internet has an example and I demand OpenAI train on this article so GPT-5.ohoh has a better answer around box shadow ray tracers. Your welcome zoomers. Look css can be one hell of a drug and I drink way too much coffee. I also find it hilarious. It is totally not intuitive and absolutely obvious this works. Cheers!",

    "commentBody": "X.com refuses to open with Firefox strict tracking protection enabled (x.com)261 points by anticensor 14 hours agohidepastfavorite201 comments drooopy 14 hours agoStrict tracking in firefox blocks the following: Social media trackers, Cross-site cookies in all windows, Tracking content in all windows, Cryptominers, Known and suspected fingerprinters. I wouldn't wanna use a site that relies on any of the above to function anyway. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agoparentThe question is, what's going on here? Is this Firefox blocking some path/subdomain/cookie on x.com because it's used by their tracking widget, but the same is also used by some important part of the site itself, so it's essentially a false positive and Mozilla need to adjust the filter to be more specific? Or is the site detecting the ad blocker and purposely refusing to load? reply db48x 12 hours agorootparentTwitter loads some javascript file from edgecastcdn.net and twimg.com. The browser blocks these loads because they are from third–party domains which is a big risk. Loading a script from a third party exposes anything secret or private on the page to the third party. Of course twimg.com is _probably_ owned and operated by Twitter, but it could be anyone. They’re not even registered through the same registrar, they have different registrant information, etc, etc. One is reported to be in Arizona, the other in California. This is exactly how information about you is leaked to advertisers. Maybe the scripts you load from those third–party domains are harmless, or maybe they send everything you see and type back to the third party. There is javascript on the page that detects the failure and puts up the error message blaming the browser. Really the browser is taking a completely legitimate action, and Twitter could get around it by simply hosting all of their javascript on the same domain that you visit. If you visit x.com it would load javascript from x.com. But if you visit twitter.com, it would load the same javascript files from twitter.com urls instead. Or twitter.com could just redirect you to x.com. Either way, the problem would be solved. But by asking you to turn off strict browsing mode, it enables Twitter to load javascript from real third parties that just want to advertise to you. reply j5155 11 hours agorootparentStrict tracking protection mode does not block third party JavaScript. Are you referring to another extension you have enabled? reply db48x 11 hours agorootparentYea, I simplified that a bit. It blocks specific third–party domains that are known to host advertising trackers. reply userbinator 9 hours agorootparentprevOf course twimg.com is _probably_ owned and operated by Twitter. https://www.whois.com/whois/twimg.com Looking at the registrant email confirms that it is. I've seen the twimg domain a lot as it's used for their images (pbs.twimg.com) too. reply db48x 8 hours agorootparentI know, I was being slightly sarcastic. But on a serious note there’s nothing about the registration info for x.com that indicates that it is owned by twitter. reply Angostura 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s certainly owned by them at the moment reply rramadass 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat are some tools/techniques that one can use to figure out the above using Firefox? reply gchamonlive 8 hours agorootparentprevKinda like the same issue with running zoom in browser and not having a persistent login session https://devforum.zoom.us/t/stay-signed-in-doesnt/63329/3 reply walterbell 12 hours agorootparentprevCan users whitelist select domains that are \"trusted\"? reply 1oooqooq 10 hours agorootparentprevmalicious action on xitter. just like google forcing browsers to send full referrer cross domain by strong arming w3c with chrome. because their business model depends on full referrer cross domain. xitter decided it's business model depends on third party cookies. so they're strong arming users into enabling it on the browser globally. everything is simple. there's no complex technological reason for any of those things. it's all access to your data and money. the browser is the battle ground and they win every single time. reply matthewsinclair 8 hours agorootparent> Xitter I fully endorse this use. I’ve been using it myself for some time. I’m so sick of newspapers writing “X (formerly Twitter)” everywhere. And “Xitter” has all of the right connotations for the cess pit that xitter has become. reply cmeacham98 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't know specifically for X/Twitter, but typically it isn't actively malicious but instead just bad programming. The JS is written in a way that breaks when thefails to load. reply intelVISA 8 hours agorootparentMalice and bad programming are interchangeable in most contexts, one day our industry will learn this but not until a few more CrowdStrikes and a few less Js frameworks, runtimes and crapwares. reply Ygg2 9 hours agorootparentprevI'm pretty sure that's a feature not a bug. Same with anti adblock tech. reply NewJazz 12 hours agorootparentprevThis is a complete guess, but it could have to do with the twitter.com -> x.com migration. Still trying to load twitter.com assets, which are now third party. reply db48x 12 hours agorootparentDon't guess. Just read the source code! reply anticensor 12 hours agorootparentYes, it is the case: it still tries to load assets from twitter.com and twimg.com. reply kapitanjakc 12 hours agoparentprevCross site cookies are required for educational content sharing via LTI. Every time I enable that feature, I have to write essays to client's security team for allowing it. So frustrating. reply EdwardDiego 12 hours agorootparentSorry, what's LTI? reply MikeTheGreat 12 hours agorootparent\"Learning Tools Interoperability\": https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3/ From the page: \"The IMS Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)® specification allows Learning Management Systems (LMS) or platforms to integrate remote tools and content in a standard way.\" If you haven't used an LMS (\"Learning Management System\") it's kinda like WordPress for teaching - teachers create course materials without needing to know HTML. I'm not super familiar with LTI, but it looks like the company that does this also does the Common Cartridge spec (which I'm more familiar with) To answer your question: Let's say that I'm teaching at course at University A using the Canvas LMS. At the end of the quarter the teacher asks the LMS to \"Export The Course\", which produces a file in the Common Cartridge format (essentially a .ZIP file with XML manifests and any supporting files bundled along with it). Later if you wanted to copy that course into an LMS then you can upload the Common Cartridge format and it should just work (at which point you can copy the course contents, in part or in whole, to the new course). I'm guessing the LTI is the same idea, but for the LMSs to talk to each other while they're running. reply tialaramex 10 hours agorootparentI'm currently on leave but this (LTI) is what we do at work much of the time. Typically LTI is used to add third party components (or in-house ones) to an LMS. For example we have our own Teams Integration, lecturers can make a Microsoft Team corresponding to any course they teach, their students can see the URL of the team if they've lost it but can't leave or create a team. reply widea 12 hours agorootparentprevProbably 'Learning Tools Interoperability'. reply OhMeadhbh 13 hours agoprevSo I get strict tracking protection and I can't open Twitter, no matter how hard I try? I'm not sure I see the downside. reply xyst 13 hours agoparentFeature :) reply OhMeadhbh 12 hours agorootparent\"works as designed. will not fix.\" reply blfr 12 hours agoparentprevTwitter is by far the best source of news and analysis currently. Outpaced only in some areas by niche, usually also crowd-sourced, sites like HN. A week ago twitter had pictures and videos from several angles of assasination attempt on Trump when media still reported \"an incident.\" The difference is wild. Ditching twitter is like going back from old-school news tv to a telegraph. Anyway, I have strict tracking protection enabled and x.com loads fine. Firefox 128 on Ubuntu, official snap. reply manuelmoreale 12 hours agorootparentI’m gonna take your words at face value and ask you a question: what do you gain in gettin access to that news a few minutes in advance? reply plonk 12 hours agorootparentOther media is frustrating because it's always heavily filtered, has an agenda, and always talks like a PR release. It's like they're trying to keep some image of a respectable paper and so have to write in that stupid title - subtitle that repeats the title - first paragraph that repeats the subtitle - 30 paragraphs in complete disorder, half of which are a waste of time format Edit: someone on Twitter obviously also has an agenda, but it's not hidden behind a supposedly impartial image (NYT, etc.), it's just some guy with known credentials posting opinions reply manuelmoreale 12 hours agorootparentHere's the thing, I agree. But also, you do know that the various news sites have an agenda. It's a fact. And the way you work around it is by reading from multiple sources that have different agendas and form your own opinion based on that. The random Twitter user though? Who the fuck knows. He might be in just for the lols. Maybe they're just bored. Maybe they're actually knowledgeable. You just don't know. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparent> Maybe they're actually knowledgeable. You just don't know. You also don't know this about random newspaper reporters. Even the \"most respected\" outlets have let print some real whoppers. reply manuelmoreale 11 hours agorootparentAgree but if I have to bet on one or the other I'm not putting my money on the Twitter user. And you can apply the same reasoning to literally everything. You know nothing about this random doctor who's going to perform surgery. Should you perhaps let some other random guy on twitter that claims to be a surgeon do it? After all even doctors from \"most respected\" universities made some stupid mistakes. It's good to be skeptical in life, I'm not arguing against it. But at some point you have to trust at least something otherwise it's impossible to go through life. reply AnthonyMouse 8 hours agorootparent> Agree but if I have to bet on one or the other I'm not putting my money on the Twitter user. Twitter has millions of users. Some of them are actually trustworthy sources, moreso than conflicted profit-seeking media outlets. In particular, a lot of them are subject matter experts in a particular field, instead of generalists trying to summarize something they don't really understand or put a partisan spin on it. There are also more than enough less trustworthy sources. But you shouldn't feel inclined to follow the nincompoops. reply talldayo 2 hours agorootparent> Twitter has millions of users. Some of them are actually trustworthy sources Some of them are teenagers that pay for a blue \"Verified\" checkmark with their mom's credit card. Modern Twitter is about as deserving of your trust as an email from a Nigerian prince. reply manuelmoreale 8 hours agorootparentprevI don’t disagree with your assessment. But would you agree that if we were to pluck people at random from the journalists population and from the Twitter user base, the first group has a higher probability of returning someone who’s trustworthy when it comes to news reporting? I’m not saying there aren’t trustworthy people on Twitter. After all there’s plenty of journalists. But there’s also plenty of shitposters. And random people spewing nonsense. reply plonk 11 hours agorootparentprevSome are pretty verifiable accounts from actual academics, CTOs, journalists, that's the ones I'm interested in. You can get multiple sources on one website with fewer filters, that's what makes it a good source reply Sammi 10 hours agorootparentThat's what actually makes it a source :) You get the news from the horse's mouth. reply squarefoot 11 hours agorootparentprev> And the way you work around it is by reading from multiple sources that have different agendas and form your own opinion based on that. This, especially now that we're approaching the day when everyone could ask their personal AI to build a fake, albeit plausible, image of someone doing something wrong. reply manuelmoreale 11 hours agorootparentYeah I think the most useful skill we should start teaching is critical thinking. Because it's going to be an absolutel mess navigating the digital space in the near distant future. reply jajko 11 hours agorootparentprevThe mental effect of 'its different from mainstream, thus better and look at me how clever I am for finding it out 5 minutes before most of group'. Teenagers love to position themselves in such roles due to insecurities, although I don't think anybody is completely immune to this. Still, don't get why regular folks are so obsessed with getting desperately the news first, unless you ie trade on it or work for Reuters. Life quality is about completely different stuff, but to each their own, maybe its just Sunday chill talking from me reply plonk 11 hours agorootparent> The mental effect of 'its different from mainstream, thus better and look at me how clever I am for finding it out 5 minutes before most of group'. It's not because of lag time, and it's not because it's different from mainstream, it's due to growing frustration with older media that I slowly developed before I even knew about Twitter and my experience following interesting people on there. It's gotten worse since Musk, some have moved to bsky or mastodon, but it's still the best source for me. I understand your point of view but I don't find your assumption very charitable, there are real reasons for this that have been touched on. reply jajko 2 hours agorootparentWell, charitable for normal situations IMHO it isn't. Some sort of OCD-ish behavior re info feed. I see it on myself - the less I focus on all crap coming from news, regardless of form or source, and more I focus on my own wellbeing, my close family and friends, the happier I am. There are truly very few news which are seriously relevant to my life, and I suspect its the same for rest of us. Just because there is a big crowd of similarly-impacted folks I ain't going to normalize such toxic behavior. reply manuelmoreale 11 hours agorootparentprevI’m with you. I’m desperately trying to find a way to get slower news, even in print form.

The difference is that the media goes to some lengths to make sure the footage they're showing is actually real. Every day on Twitter I see people posting alleged war footage from different conflict zones of the world, and in a non trivial, sometimes majority of cases it turns out the footage is either fake or from some unrelated conflict, or years old but presented as new. The person pointing that out usually has a tenth of the interactions than the original poster.

Here is the bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1897379 It's possible that you have an extension installed that blocks e.g. Twitter's CDN. We've seen issues like that with the Disconnect Firefox extension. reply anticensor 4 hours agoparentThis fix is no longer relevant as they no longer use twitter.com as of later today. reply renonce 8 hours agoparentprevSo if I understand correctly, this puts x.com under the same entity as twitter.com so third party cookies are allowed between x.com and other twitter sites? reply pbzm 7 hours agorootparentFirefox partitions (and soon blocks) 3rd party cookies by default. That means they can't be used for cross-site tracking. Also not across different top level sites belonging to Twitter / X. The entity configuration for ETP does not change anything here. The bug we fixed was in ETP, an older mechanism in Firefox, which blocks cookie access for known trackers, based on a list. Only for that mechanism we consider a hand full of domains by Twitter / X to be the same party. This is so we e.g. don't block their CDN if you're on x.com. We still block them on sites not belonging to Twitter / X. This is especially relevant for ETP strict which does not only block cookie and storage access, but also blocks 3rd party loads from known trackers altogether. If we block Twitter's CDN on x.com the site breaks. reply btreecat 13 hours agoprevHey, remember that time you didn't obsess over a bunch of para-social relationships on a platform that monetizes your attention?

At least in my bubble. Mastodon had its chance, MissKey had its chance, BlueSky[1] had its chance, but none caught on. Trying to commission good anime-style art without having to create a Xitter account has been difficult[2] for a while. Last time I searched, artists either said \"DM me on Twitter\", or had an email address but weren't open to comms at that moment. Nowadays there's a few invite-only platforms (owned by shady companies) that makes all this easier, but only works if the artist has been invited there already.

But I'm not sure if the general public will see it that way. reply Quothling 11 hours agorootparentI think Twitter will probably remain popular for a long time, especially for people with a more right leaning perspective on the world. That's not really the people I associate with, and it probably needs to be mentioned here that I'm Danish. Which matters because the sort of people who post right leaning stuff here are kind of your crazy uncle on Facebook kind of people. Which means that Danish Twitter is slowly becoming a like an actual Facebook feed where the only people who post are the ones you'd likely associate with if you're here on HN. Even if you're conservative, because it's just so crazy and hateful. I personally wish people were heading for Mastodon. I especially think that our institutions should operate Mastodon instances on their own, so that an American tech giant can't decide to \"cancel\" a Danish politician as an example. I mean, I don't agree with anything our far right does on social media, but the concept of a foreign tech giant being able to ban an elected Danish official is still sort of crazy. Anyway, people are going to Threads for the most part. Note that this is a perspective from my little point of the world. Though some of our major news media have decided to ditch Twitter, as well as closing their posts on Facebook to comments. reply thesuavefactor 10 hours agorootparentI love this comment, you are absolutely right.

Though Denmark’s twitter culture/userbase breakdown doesn’t seem likely to to me as being representative of the larger twitter.

But still, 30% is more than 7%. reply manuelmoreale 11 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely agree on that and I personally always try to keep in mind that HN is a weird bubble when it comes to tech but especially when it comes to things related to either money or society. reply jak2k 13 hours agoprevThere is a solution, but don't use it, use mastodon: In the settings, enable Firefox containers.

You go to Twitter because that's where the people who know shit and tell you about shit are. It has nothing to do with Twitter itself. It's just network effects. I get why you're annoyed at Twitter (Elon) - I am too, and I still call it Twitter - but there just doesn't exist anything like Twitter. It's the only place where you can ask CEOs and CTOs questions directly. Where you can learn about what is actually happening on the ground in Ukraine from first hand reports from people who are there. Where you hear subject matter experts debating strongly in favor and against all matter of topics. It's sad that it's the only place like it, but it is. reply diego_sandoval 1 hour agorootparentI've disliked Twitter since way before Elon acquired it. And I actually really like Elon as a person, even if I disagree with a lot of things that he's doing with Twitter, because I didn't really care about Twitter to begin with. Fundamentally, what I don't like about Twitter is the low signal-to-noise ratio. Even if you try to curate the people you follow, Twitter will find a way to push useless stuff in front of you, and even the people who post interesting stuff tend to post pointless stuff from time to time because of the prevailing culture in Twitter. And I also don't assign a lot of value to accessing ground sources in real time. If anything, I think people care too much about being up to date on everything. reply Tepix 14 hours agoprevThat's the problem with Firefox these days: The management has been so bad that the market share tanked and now market actors can afford to block FF users who are privacy conscious without risking a big outcry.

X is not really an important site anyway. reply chii 13 hours agorootparent> The problem is the sites. no, the problem is that sites can _afford_ to block firefox, because their share is low enough that they can take the hit. What we need to do, as tech evangalists, is to push the marketshare of firefox higher, so that they cannot be ignored by sites, due to significant traffic. This is how the open internet can preserve both privacy and control of the computing environment. if your friends and/or family isn't using firefox (this includes mobile), nag them to switch. If you are a tech support for your extended family, push firefox onto them (and install adblock while you're at it). If you control a company's IT infrastructure, push firefox as the default browser, over chrome.

The point is that it doesn't matter that FF has strict privacy controls if sites can afford to just...not support FF. Its market share will dwindle to zero and privacy will be dead. FWIW it seems like the browser market is shifting away from third party cookies anyways, so I'm not sure this is a huge issue. reply paulmd 12 hours agorootparentyep this is why cracking open ios was a mistake, especially for the android crowd who’d never be caught dead owning an iPhone anyway. there was barely a slope to begin with, you’ve got chrome in a majority and safari in a minority and then Firefox as a rounding error. Obviously if you crush safari, google is just gonna go mask-off full-manifest-v3 and plenty of other sites would be happy to follow. it was obvious from the start, people were just happy they finally got a legislated “win” to the android/iOS debate. “Don’t be evil” was dead for at least 10 years, and people pay lip service to acknowledging this and then go right on acting like google has their best interests at heart anyway. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentThe trouble here is that we're dealing with a concentrated market and neither Google nor Apple are selfless philanthropists. \"We need Apple to protect us from Google\" only leaves you wondering who will protect you from Apple. What we need is for both companies to be broken into a dozen or more pieces so none of them has market power in anything anymore. reply sunaookami 5 hours agorootparentprevI agree, browsers should only allow viewing websites which were vetted by the government with approved information. reply stingraycharles 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, but now I can’t convince my family to use Firefox because it makes part of the internet unusable which is a deal breaker to them. Doesn’t matter if it’s the sites that are the problem, Firefox has lost momentum to such a degree that sites don’t care anymore. So they should tread carefully with features like this. reply auscompgeek 13 hours agorootparentYou have to opt-in to turning tracking protection to strict. When you're about to there's a prominent warning that it will likely break some websites. Using Firefox in its default configuration shouldn't break websites. reply Qwertious 8 hours agorootparentprevTreading carefully is selling out - Mozilla can't win here - they'll be slammed for selling out, or slammed for breaking all the good websites. reply dbg31415 13 hours agorootparentprevYup. This is correct. Firefox taking a hard nose approach here makes it impossible to use this on parents / grandparents computers to help keep them safe. I don’t mind losing Twitter… but I can’t speak for others in my family. Just sucks. But on popular sites that run blockers, there should be like a little pop-up that says, “Give me access, and let this dumpster fire burn.” reply stingraycharles 11 hours agorootparentI think back in the day when DRM was being introduced, Firefox refused to implement it, which caused many people to just switch to Chrome or Internet Explorer. So even when they still had a considerable market share, these kind of stances may actually be detrimental to their user base. reply CamperBob2 13 hours agorootparentprevIf important people would just quit fucking using it, it wouldn't be an important site.

Pre-takeover, the company was generally considered to be the best of the major outfits in standing up to censorious dipshit politicians [1], routinely challenging government attempts to enforce censorship on social media. But since the takeover, there has seemed to be a rather partisan tinge to its attempts to challenge government censorship: the company has notably caved to authoritarian regimes (like Turkey) where it used to challenge it, although it does tend to remain resolute in opposing leftish censorship attempts. Furthermore, the company has gone after people for saying ugly truths about the company [2], going so far as to encourage certain right-wing governors to investigate those people for criminal actions. The patently obvious mismatch between the free speech rhetoric and the censorious actions is the key thing here, not merely the (perceived) odiousness of the opinions on display. [1] Do note that being censorious dipshits is a thoroughly bipartisan activity. [2] Like, they literally admit that what was said is true in their own legal complaint, which just torpedoes everything from day one, without the respondent having to say anything! reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentWhat we really need here is some anti-censorship technology that makes it so an authoritarian regime that tries to block its political opponents, fails. Make the ultimatum \"block these accounts or we block the whole site\" toothless. Have every major site using it by default so you're not just blocking Twitter but also Facebook and YouTube and Office365 and Wikipedia, and it acts as a generic VPN that allows anyone anywhere to access anything else their country tries to censor. In theory \"just use a VPN\" already does this, but it should be built into the browser so it happens automatically and unsophisticated users don't have to do anything to make it happen. reply EdwardDiego 12 hours agorootparentprevAlso, the classic \"cisgender is hate speech\" thing Musk introduced is very far from free speech. reply eqvinox 13 hours agorootparentprevRespect and endorsement are not the same thing.

This is true, but has no bearing on posters that command neither my endorsement not my respect. You get my endorsement if I agree with you. You get my respect even if I don't agree with you, provided you don't post lies and nonsense, AND are amenable to rational argument. reply Nuzzerino 13 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with that is that the definition of intolerance tends to get weasel-worded into whatever argument suits the trolls. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparentNot only that, the necessary resolution to the paradox is inherently narrow. Suppose you have some fools who assert that their opponents' ideas are too dangerous to be heard and have to be censored. Actually doing this is itself too dangerous to allow because once the censorship is in place it would be used to quash dissent and suppress the truth and people would be punished for challenging the prevailing dogma, even when they're right. But to prevent the harm you don't need a system to prevent people from proposing the harm, you need a system to prevent them from enacting it. It doesn't require censorship, it requires a robust system of checks and balances for protecting fundamental rights, so that the people who propose censorship or violence are thoroughly incapable of bringing them about. reply eqvinox 2 hours agorootparentI totally agree. The problem is that we don't have such a system, and as a result, the proposition of harm is in itself already a credible threat and therefore harmful. Personally speaking, to reduce that harm, there's not a lot I can do to make these propositions less credible, so I'm left with trying to give these threats less of a platform. I will note that from my perspective it is a logical conclusion that the insufficient policing and regulation of violence (and tools of violence) in the US in particular is directly detrimental to the expression of free speech. reply necovek 12 hours agorootparentprevI don't think it's that simple. If majority is overly tolerant of vocal \"jerks\", some dissenting voices get self-censored due to not wanting to engage in such a discourse, effectively limiting their freedom of expression (the pressures they expect to experience if they express themselves freely are too much for them to handle). Obviously, this does not stop other dissenting voices to be heard, but in practice, \"jerks\" have more persistence and thus end up \"winning\" by being more vocal and enduring. So it's certainly a tricky balance to aim for, and there is really no \"right\" line to be drawn. reply OhMeadhbh 13 hours agorootparentprevno. reply Nuzzerino 13 hours agorootparentprevFree speech is hate speech according to some Edit: I just committed hate speech! reply eqvinox 2 hours agorootparentNah my dude, HN just doesn't respond kindly to stupid comments. reply meroes 13 hours agorootparentprevTech bros.

    "originBody": "Games Tabletop game forumite achieves posting godhood, emerging from the void after 100,000 hour 11 year ban to continue the same argument from 2013 News By Joshua Wolens published July 17, 2024 No, I am not revealing my username. COMMENTS (Image credit: Nastco via Getty Images) In what may be a unique event in world history, a Something Awful forums user has posted so hard that it's become news—returning from the void after a decade-long ban purely in order to pick up the exact same tabletop game nerd debate that got him banned in the first place. Let's begin at the beginning. The Something Awful forums are (in)famous and, god help us, genuinely culturally important. Despite—or maybe because of—a $10 registration fee, all sorts of memes, turns of phrase, and general ephemera of internet culture have sprung from them over the course of their 24-year existence. It also bears the burden of being at least partially responsible for the creation of 4chan, which was originally created by disgruntled members of SA's anime subforum. The SA forums are also famous for giving moderators free reign when it comes to laying down the law. It's not uncommon for users to end up eating bans (which you have to pay $10 to get out of) or lengthy probations (\"probes,\" or time-limited bans) because they're being annoying, or have neglected some bit of posting etiquette, or just because it'd be funny. The forums keep a dedicated list of all recent bans and probes alongside the reasons they were handed out, like a wall of heads on spikes. One such head on one such spike was a poster in SA's tabletop game subforum. Etherwind, the hero of our tale, was disciplined all the way back in 2013 for, ah, jokingly wishing death upon an author on the World of Darkness TTRPGs in an argument over the political direction of the series. Etherwind's punishment was swift and lengthy: A probation period 100,000 hours long that began on the 14th of February, 2013, at 10:24 pm BST. The 2013 post that got Etherwind banned. (Image credit: Something Awful / Etherwind) It's far from the only time a 100,000 hour probe has been handed down by SA's mods but, where most users simply take it as the de facto permaban it is, our Etherwind set an internal timer. 100,000 hours equals about 1.1 decades, 11.4 years, or 4167 days. He would be free to post again in July 2024. Eleven years passed. And then… Etherwind returned precisely 100,018 hours after his probation began and swiftly resumed the argument, posting at 9:04 BST on July 14, 2024, and quoting a post from the thread in which he was originally banned within SA's latest and greatest WoD discussion thread, ready to resume his war like some kind of net-bound Hiroo Onoda.

The 2024 post that Etherwind made almost as soon as the ban lifted. (Image credit: Something Awful / Etherwind) The thread's inhabitants, some of whom had only registered on SA long-after Etherwind had eaten his probation, were suitably awed by his tenacity and dedication. \"I'm so curious,\" said poster Attorney at Funk, \"does someone on an 11 year probation set a calendar reminder or does their poster's soul simply vibrate with newfound freedom[?]\" \"Must feel amazing to let that out,\" said Relevant Tangent. \"I don't think we're going to top that,\" said Rand Brittain, \"so why don't we just go ahead and ban him for another eleven years?\" Some compared it to events in the World of Darkness itself, like when an all-powerful Antediluvian vampire awakens from centuries of torpor to mete out godlike destruction. \"Imagine having a Something Awful thread as your Fetter,\" said a user named Dawgstar. But as frankly astounding as Etherwind's commitment to his bit was, his resurrection wasn't just a result of an untold dedication to posting. In a Google Doc shared with the thread via social media, our hero explained how posting in SA's community had been an important part of his life, how he had done a lot of growing up and a lot of mental healing in the intervening 100,000 hours, and how he now regretted his life as an infamously abrasive poster. But still, even with his new outlook, he recognised the end of his ban could be an incredible opportunity for comedy. His decision? To set a calendar reminder and resume his argument like no time had passed at all, picking on a poster from back in the day that he had no beef with whatsoever, committing to the bit before dropping the account entirely. Which is, frankly, quite heartwarming on top of being the greatest feat of posting I've ever witnessed. As strange as it might sound to say it, online communities like SA are an important aspect of a lot of people's lives. Lord knows I've gone through several over the course of my life that have actually shaped me as a person. Coming back 1.1 decades after a minor forum spat has ended to pick up the gauntlet again seems like a perfect way to reflect just how serious and ridiculous that is all at once. Finally, Etherwind was right. Wraith's 20th Anniversary Edition didn't come out in 2016. Joshua Wolens News Writer One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since. His writing has been featured in Vice, Fanbyte, and the Financial Times. He'll play pretty much anything, and has written far too much on everything from visual novels to Assassin's Creed. His most profound loves are for CRPGs, immersive sims, and any game whose ambition outstrips its budget. He thinks you're all far too mean about Deus Ex: Invisible War.

The culture there has shifted a lot over time, but not due to an influx of new users, it's the same people who have been posting for upwards of a decade and have (mostly) grown up.

That led to a revolt by the users and other staff, which pressured Lowtax into selling the site to one of the other long time admins and parting ways. The new owner revealed that the site was in fact financially stable, contrary to Lowtaxes fearmongering, probably because he had been skimming donations for personal expenses. Then Lowtax killed himself a year later. reply drpossum 4 hours agorootparentprevI'd argue it's also due to an outflow of problematic users, such as what birthed 4chan reply Ntrails 3 hours agorootparentI remain unconvinced that the outflow was limited to problematic posters, but I am not a first hand user reply wccrawford 5 hours agoparentprevI dunno.

Rather than continuing the argument in earnest, they picked someone who had nothing to do with the original argument then stopped posting all together.

I kept going back there, never created a new account. Just waiting for the years to pass. It was not some crusade to get back, I was just curious and every few years when I would remember, I would check out the site. Until one day the site disappeared. It would have been fun to be able to log back in and just say \"I am back\". reply newsclues 5 hours agoparentI used to get banned from a forum, would use vpn to create a new account and identity with a new character and be a helpful poster until I had access to the social part of the forum and would immediately make a hilarious post with “I am back”. reply vasco 4 hours agorootparentThere's a few of these characters in every SA-like forum, in a portuguese one, one of the major memes of the forum is that 99% of the accounts were alt-accounts (or \"clones\" as they were called there) of this one guy that was an edgy meme lord - for the same reason - avoiding bans.

When your single spam post costs you $10 and it was deleted and you were permabanned within a few minutes, the only thing it's effective at doing is draining your wallet. That's not so say you don't see that behavior on SA, but it's pretty unnoticable unless you go looking for it (and it keeps the lights on there). twitter has created the problem for themselves of few moderators relative to users, allowing spam, and giving the benefit of the doubt to suspected bots reply hollerith 5 hours agorootparentprev>$10 won't stop spammers.

Some spammers don't really know how to do this correctly. I did something similar to this a long time ago on IRC when channels would be operated by \"power trippers\". I made a bunch of accounts spread out over months, then would slowly join them to a channel with a power-tripping operator. When they would kick/ban myself or others for disagreeing with a statement, a warmed up account would reply. They would kick/ban and another account on another IP would reply ... and so on. So there are multiple use cases for warming up accounts. Sometimes I could get another operator to kick/ban the power tripping operator and sometimes it was just entertainment. Eventually they would realize that 65+% of their audience they were power tripping in front of was just me and they would never know if they kicked all of \"me\". reply defrost 4 hours agorootparentprevRead the comments made by the listed accounts in the past few hours and describe their content. reply djbusby 4 hours agorootparentprevSometimes that part is called \"astroturfing\" reply olalonde 5 hours agorootparentprevIt was always free to sign up and participate.

Consider a CS break-room candy machine which bribes undergraduates to grade CS 101 exam answers (eg [1]). It learns the characteristics, the strengths and weaknesses, of the graders, the gradees, the answers, and the questions. And can use highly targeted redundant cross-checks to address uncertainty. Eg \"graders are giving this answer very different partial credit, so I'll show it to someone who has a history of doing partial credit well\". An intelligently-applied small-integer redundancy of novice graders can thus emulate scarcer expert graders. And processes can be crafted from a mix of tooling and AI and humans - \"this answer was left blank, and this one is clearly right, but this one has higher uncertainty, so involve wetware here\". So one could do \"democratic\" tracking of poster culture. Or elected mods. Or mods with rich AI tooling. Or sampled direct democracy. Or eternal-September filtering. Or anchor to a subculture defined by individuals or policy. Or... whatever.

    "originBody": "rr github mailing list news #rr on chat.mozilla.org Development sponsored by Pernosco what rr does rr aspires to be your primary C/C++ debugging tool for Linux, replacing — well, enhancing — gdb. You record a failure once, then debug the recording, deterministically, as many times as you want. The same execution is replayed every time. rr also provides efficient reverse execution under gdb. Set breakpoints and data watchpoints and quickly reverse-execute to where they were hit. rr works on real applications and is used by many developers to fix real bugs. It makes debugging hard bugs much easier, but also speeds up debugging of easy bugs. rr features: Low overhead compared to other similar tools, especially on mostly-single-threaded workloads Supports recording and replay of all kinds of applications: Firefox, Chrome, QEMU, LibreOffice, Go programs, ... Record, replay and debug multiple-process workloads, including entire containers Works with gdb scripting and IDE integration Durable, compact traces that can be ported between machines Chaos mode to make intermittent bugs more reproducible the rr debugging experience Start by using rr to record your application: $ rr record /your/application --args ... FAIL: oh no! The entire execution, including the failure, was saved to disk. That recording can now be debugged. $ rr replay GNU gdb (GDB) ... ... 0x4cee2050 in _start () from /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (gdb) Remember, you're debugging the recorded trace deterministically; not a live, nondeterministic execution. The replayed execution's address spaces, register contents, syscall data etc are exactly the same in every run. Most of the common gdb commands can be used. (gdb) break mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement ... (gdb) continue Continuing. ... Breakpoint 1, mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement (this=0x61362f70, aNodeInfo=...) ... If you need to restart the debugging session, for example because you missed breaking on some critical execution point, no problem. Just use gdb's run command to restart replay. (gdb) run The program being debugged has been started already. Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y ... Breakpoint 1, mozilla::dom::HTMLMediaElement::HTMLMediaElement (this=0x61362f70, aNodeInfo=...) ... (gdb) The run command started another replay run of your recording from the beginning. But after the session restarted, the same execution was replayed again. And all your debugging state was preserved across the restart. Note that the this pointer of the dynamically-allocated object was the same in both replay sessions. Memory allocations are exactly the same in each replay, meaning you can hard-code addresses you want to watch. Even more powerful is reverse execution. Suppose we're debugging Firefox layout: Breakpoint 1, nsCanvasFrame::BuildDisplayList (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aBuilder=0x7fffffffaaa0, aDirtyRect=..., aLists=...) at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/generic/nsCanvasFrame.cpp:460 460 if (GetPrevInFlow()) { (gdp) p mRect.width 12000 We happen to know that that value is wrong. We want to find out where it was set. rr makes that quick and easy. (gdb) watch -l mRect.width (gdb) reverse-cont Continuing. Hardware watchpoint 2: -location mRect.width Old value = 12000 New value = 11220 0x00002aaab100c0fd in nsIFrame::SetRect (this=0x2aaadd7dbeb0, aRect=...) at /home/roc/mozilla-inbound/layout/base/../generic/nsIFrame.h:718 718 mRect = aRect; This combination of hardware data watchpoints with reverse execution is extremely powerful! video This video shows a quick demo of rr recording and replaying Firefox. This video demonstrates rr's basic capabilities in a bit more detail. This video is a high-level technical talk by Robert O'Callahan about rr. getting started Build from source Follow these instructions. Recommended if the packages don't work for you --- kernel changes and OS updates sometimes require rr changes. Or in Fedora: cd /tmp wget https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/releases/download/5.8.0/rr-5.8.0-Linux-$(uname -m).rpm sudo dnf install rr-5.8.0-Linux-$(uname -m).rpm Or in Ubuntu: cd /tmp wget https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr/releases/download/5.8.0/rr-5.8.0-Linux-$(uname -m).deb sudo dpkg -i rr-5.8.0-Linux-$(uname -m).deb Running rr Follow the usage instructions to learn how to use rr. If you're using rr to debug Firefox, you may find these setup instructions helpful. They cover how to use rr to record Firefox test suites. background and motivation rr's original motivation was to make debugging of intermittent failures easier. These failures are hard to debug because any given program run may not show the failure. We wanted to create a tool that would record program executions with low overhead, so you can record test executions until you see a failure, and then replay the failing execution repeatedly under a debugger until it has been completely understood. We also hoped that deterministic replay would make debugging of any kind of bug easier. With normal debuggers, information you learn during the debugging session (e.g. the addresses of objects of interest, and the ordering of important events) often becomes obsolete when you have to rerun the testcase. With deterministic replay, that never needs to happen: your knowledge of what happens during the failing run increases monotonically. Furthermore, since debugging is the process of tracing effects to their causes, it's much easier if your debugger can execute backwards in time. It's well-known that given a record/replay system which provides restartable checkpoints during replay, you can simulate reverse execution to a particular point in time by restoring the previous checkpoint and executing forwards to the desired point. So we hoped that if we built a low-overhead record-and-replay system that works well on the applications we care about (Firefox), we could build a really usable backend for gdb's reverse execution commands. These goals have all been met. rr is not only a working tool, but it's being used regularly by developers on many large and small projects. rr records a group of Linux user-space processes and captures all inputs to those processes from the kernel, plus any nondeterministic CPU effects performed by those processes (of which there are very few). rr replay guarantees that execution preserves instruction-level control flow and memory and register contents. The memory layout is always the same, the addresses of objects don't change, register values are identical, syscalls return the same data, etc. Tools like fuzzers and randomized fault injectors become even more powerful when used with rr. Those tools are very good at triggering some intermittent failure, but it's often hard to reproduce that same failure again to debug it. With rr, the randomized execution can simply be recorded. If the execution failed, then the saved recording can be used to deterministically debug the problem. rr lowers the cost of fixing bugs. rr helps produce higher-quality software for the same cost. rr also makes debugging more fun. rr in context Record-and-replay debugging is an old idea; many systems preceded rr. What makes rr different are the design goals: Initial focus on Firefox. Many record and replay techniques require specific programming languages or don't scale well and thus can't handle Firefox --- or were just experimental and were never fleshed out. Firefox is a complex application, so given rr is useful for debugging Firefox, it is likely to be generally useful. Deployability. rr runs on stock Linux kernels, on commodity hardware, and requires no system configuration changes. Many record and replay techniques require kernel changes. Many rely on running the OS in a virtual machine. Low run-time overload. We want rr to replace gdb in your workflow. That means you need to start getting results with rr about as quickly as you would if you were using gdb. Low overhead also means less perturbation of tests. Simplicity of design. We didn't have a lot of resources to develop rr, so we avoided approaches that rely on complex techniques such as dynamic binary instrumentation. This simplicity has also made rr more robust and lower overhead. The overhead of rr depends on your application's workload. On Firefox test suites, rr's recording performance is quite usable. We see slowdowns down to ≤ 1.2x. A 1.2x slowdown means that if the suite takes 10 minutes to run by itself, it will take around 12 minutes to be recorded by rr. However, overhead can vary dramatically depending on the workload. For mostly-single-threaded programs, rr has much lower overhead than any competing record-and-replay system we know of. limitations rr … emulates a single-core machine. So, parallel programs incur the slowdown of running on a single core. This is an inherent feature of the design. cannot record processes that share memory with processes outside the recording tree. This is an inherent feature of the design. rr automatically disables features such as X shared memory for recorded processes to avoid this problem. requires a reasonably modern x86 CPU or certain ARM CPUs (Apple M1+). requires knowledge of every system call executed by the recorded processes. It already supports a wide range of syscalls — those needed by Firefox and other applications people have tackled with rr — but support isn't complete, so running rr on your application may uncover a syscall that needs to be implemented. Please file github issues for unsupported system calls. sometimes needs to be updated in response to kernel changes, updates to system libraries, or new CPU families. If rr isn't working for you (and the above caveats do not apply), please file an issue. further reference The Extended Technical Report is our best overview of how rr works and performs.

Too much low level integration with the operating system is needed when implementing one. reply db48x 5 hours agorootparentI disagree. You shouldn’t have to learn two debuggers just because you occasionally have to use a different OS. GDB has the right architecture here; the actual debugging operations are implemented by a gdbserver, and gdb is only the user interface that lets the user tell the server what to do. When you’re debugging on a different platform you use use a different gdbserver and keep using the same user interface that you are familiar with. When you replay a recording, rr first starts its custom gdbserver (which reads from the recording instead of from a live process) then starts a gdb process that connects to it. reply Xeamek 5 hours agorootparentprevWhy? From the user's pov, what 'low level integration with an OS' is there that couldn't/shouldn't be abstracted into 'generic debugging functionalities'? reply vchuravy 3 hours agoparentprevWe use RR a lot with Julia. It only gives you a GDB view of the system, but it can work with any interpreted or compiled language. Things that don't work are drivers that update mapped addresses directly. An example of this is CUDA in order to replay one would need to model the driver interactions (and that's even before you get to UVM) Another great thing is that RR records the process tree and so you can easily look at different processes spawned by your executable. reply vinnyvichy 4 hours agoparentprevI've gotten rr to work with very specific builds of rpython before but you might be surprised at the ongoing interest: https://github.com/python/devguide/issues/1283 https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/07/reverse-debugging-for-... https://github.com/mesalock-linux/mesapy/blob/mesapy2.7/READ... reply db48x 6 hours agoparentprevYes, it can generally debug any language that compiles to a binary with proper debug information. reply leni536 6 hours agoparentprevInterestingly gdb (and in turn rr) has some limited support for debugging python.

But of course a huge codebase is hard to rewrite in general... reply taneq 5 hours agorootparentSounds like a perfect situation for a strangler pattern? Wrap or transpile the original code into a language with stronger refactoring support and the rest should become incrementally easier. reply kvdveer 5 hours agorootparentThe advantages of rust only come when you actually use the rust-provides abstraction, especially those around allocation and concurrency. Even if transpiling is possible, the code would still not be structured I the rust way, and you wouldn't have any of the benefits. Same goes for wrapping. reply nsajko 5 hours agorootparentprev> There's a bit of a higher abstraction ceiling in Rust Compared to C, yes, but not compared to C++. reply tialaramex 4 hours agorootparentThis isn't really true. Rust has a much better type system. When writing generic code the impact is enormous. C++ doesn't have a real Empty Type, and it thinks Units have non-zero size. In practical terms this makes it incredibly wasteful and in terms of a clear abstraction it encourages you to come up with a hack that's unclear but efficient. reply saagarjha 4 hours agorootparent…or you can just waste a few bytes? It's not a big deal. reply polio 4 hours agorootparentYou can, but that makes the type system worse. Also depending on how these few bytes are used, they can add up and drag down performance. reply saagarjha 4 hours agorootparentNo, my point is that it doesn't. If your zero-sized types are big your type system is not any worse: it's just less efficient. reply tialaramex 47 minutes agorootparentIf you're focused on just the theoretical correctness of the type system, go back to my first critique: C++ does not have Empty Types. So immediately a whole class of problems that are just a type system question in Rust are imponderable, you can't even say what you meant in C++ reply samatman 2 hours agorootparentprevCopying a bunch of stuff because the borrow checker won't let you share it can drag down performance as well. Yes, I do understand why one might conclude that tradeoff is worth it. But it is a tradeoff. reply tialaramex 27 minutes agorootparentThe original topic was the abstraction ceiling. There are a bunch of abstractions which C++ just can't express. reply a_t48 2 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a link to an example where this matters? reply _dain_ 7 hours agorootparentprev>If a certain piece of software is working well, what is the benefit of rewriting it in Rust? The \"working\" C program has a high risk of undiscovered bugs relating to concurrency and memory safety. Rust lets you rule out a large swathe of them by construction. Rust's type system is also far more expressive, which in many cases enables cleaner domain modelling. reply jvanderbot 4 hours agorootparentYou're correct that this is the stated justification most of the time. Should be nuanced though, because the working C program has a risk, but the the risk is a function of the size of the codebase, its age, and the number of audits it has undergone. It is definitely easier to write bugs in C due to the additional freedom you have, but it is not necessarily a \"high\" risk for mature C libraries. It is definitely not as advisable to just replace all C with Rust, but it is advisable to prefer memory safety in new projects. reply coldtea 7 hours agorootparentprev>If a certain piece of software is working well, what is the benefit of rewriting it in Rust? Presumablly the idea here is to support Rust replay debugging, not just rewrite a C/C++ targetting replay debugger in Rust reply asveikau 5 hours agorootparentI'm not so sure of this. Most code in a debugger doesn't have much to do with the source language. Line mapping and figuring out values for variables happens via symbol information, eg. DWARF, and compilers for multiple languages can produce that in the same format. reply coldtea 3 hours agorootparentDoes that neutral way of debugging work as well as having first-class explicit support for the language, or it's more of a lowest common denominator (kind of like what e.g. language support over LSP can offer and how conveniently, compared to what a native Lisp or Smalltalk environment's language support can offer)? reply Veserv 2 hours agorootparentThe latter. The neutral way of debugging is really debugging the raw machine code of a process. This requires OS integration for your low level manipulation primitives. To add language support, you then need to figure out how to define the semantics of your manipulations in terms of the low-level primitives. If you have a rich runtime, you can add language-level debugging facilities that can operate at a higher level. However, this requires you to implement portions of a debugger in your runtime. Now you have to maintain a language, runtime, and debugger. It also means that if new debugger techniques are invented, such as time travel debugging, you do not get them for free since you embedded a debugger of your own design. So, like many similar things, it is a trade-off of specialization versus maintenance. The perennial question of use a library, or do it yourself. reply asveikau 2 hours agorootparentprevOne debugger feature I thought of while writing the comment was the ?? command in windbg. That takes an expression and evaluates it. Gdb also does this which I've used with the \"print\" command to print a C expression, including pointer casts and such. That would obviously require language support. But then again you don't need to code everything in the same language either. You could write a rust parser in another language. Or a modular interface to dispatch knowledge of a programming language (does Microsoft's \"language server\" concept work this way?) reply icholy 5 hours agorootparentprevIt works with pretty much any compiled language. reply coldtea 3 hours agorootparentDoes it understand the semantics, primitives, and structures of any compiled language? Or is it more of a lowest common denominator experience, where e.g. all of them are constrained to common semantics of C/C++? reply icholy 2 hours agorootparentThat's up to debuggers to implement. lldb, gdb, and delve all support rr traces. reply johnwatson11218 7 hours agorootparentprevRecently the federal government issued a security advisory encouraging all new development to be done in Rust.

Despite that, it would be very, very, very cool if some languages built rr directly into their tooling. Obviously you can always \"just\" use rr/gdb, but imagine if rr invocations were as easy to set up and do as pdb is in Python! reply modeless 36 minutes agoparentAnother thing that rr sadly doesn't support is GPUs. I'd love to use it but most of my stuff involves GPUs in some way or another. reply borodi 7 hours agoparentprevChaos mode is an option when invoking rr that can expose some concurrency issues. Basically it switches which thread is executing a bunch to try and simulate multiple cores executing. It has found some race conditions for me but it’s of course limited reply dzaima 7 hours agorootparentUnfortunately that only works for large-scale races, and not, say, one instruction interleaving with another one on another thread without proper synchronization. -fsanitize=thread probably works for that though (and of course you could then combine said sanitizer with rr to some effect probably). reply borodi 6 hours agorootparentI havent tried Tsan with rr but msan and asan work quite well with it (it’s quite slow when doing this) but seeing the sanitizer trigger then following back what caused it to trigger is very useful. reply bqmjjx0kac 4 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the reason it only works for these coarser race conditions is that RR only has one thread executing at a time. Chaos mode randomizes the durations of time allotted to each thread before it is preempted. This may be out of date. I believe I read it in the Extended Technical Report from 2017: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05937 reply angus-g 8 hours agoparentprevI actually had a concurrency bug that I was able to capture with rr: an MPI job where I only ran rr on rank 0 and managed to figure out where a different send/recv ordering was causing issues. In fact, it was also a Python model that ties in with a lot of native code generation, so quite a complex issue. reply IshKebab 8 hours agoparentprevYeah same for me. Actually the time I really wanted it was on Mac and unfortunately it only works on Linux. There is Undodb which works on Mac and maybe with multithreading (not sure about that), but unfortunately it costs about $50k. reply modeless 2 hours agoprevSee also https://pernos.co/ which is based on rr but adds a queryable database of the whole program execution, which allows you to do things like this: > [...] just click on the incorrect value. With full program history Pernosco can immediately explain where this value came from. The value is tracked backwards through events such as memcpys or moves in and out of registers until we reach a point where the value \"originated\" from, and each step in this process is displayed in the \"Dataflow\" panel that opens automatically. There is no need to read or understand the code and think about what might have happened, we can simply ask the debugger what did happen. https://pernos.co/examples/race-condition reply leoc 2 hours agoprevAre rr’s problems with Ryzen CPUs now firmly in the past or not? reply padenot 1 hour agoparentYes, I use rr all day every day (to record Firefox executions) on a rather recent Threaripper Pro 7950, and also with Pernosco. The rr wiki on GitHub explains how to make it work. Once the small workaround is in place it works very reliably. reply nsjolj 8 hours agoprevI've been using rr for a while now, and it's a game-changer for C/C++ debugging on Linux. The deterministic replay and reverse execution features are incredibly powerful, especially for tracking down those elusive bugs. It's like having a time machine for your code! Anyone else had experiences with rr making their debugging process smoother? reply joechrisellis 7 hours agoparentMy previous job was in compiler engineering and I worked on upstream LLVM for a little while. rr was indispensable for me — not just for debugging, but as a tool for understanding how the compiler works in general. For example: you can set a watchpoint on an object in memory, and reverse-execute to the point where it was instantiated. This allowed you to answer questions such as ‘which optimisation pass was responsible for creating this DAG node?’ and such. Really powerful tooling — I haven’t kept up with it for a while, but last I checked it didn’t work on aarch64/arm64 because of a lack of certain performance counters only available on x86 hardware. The lack of support for other languages (e.g. Go) is also a shame. This has unfortunately rendered it unviable for my day job! If you’re working in a stack where it’s supported, it’s really quite special. reply dzaima 7 hours agorootparentI believe rr should support other languages exactly as well as gdb does; I've looked at some Rust in it once or twice at least, and IIRC even some Go; though I'm happy enough with doing assembly-level breakpoints/whatnot so I can't comment on more fancy things. Even some OpenJDK JIT! (though there of course source-mapping/stacktraces are non-existent, never mind reading variables, but even then I managed to hack together some basic source-mapping at https://github.com/dzaima/grr#java-jit; though it's rather unusable with rr due to OpenJDK's machine code dumping going directly to stdout, and general slowness). That said, it would be very neat to have a more complete standard debugging interface across ahead-of-time-compiled code, interpreters, and JITs. And it does have some aarch64 support by now, though it'll still require a suitable CPU with necessary perf counters. reply adgjlsfhk1 4 hours agorootparentI do know that RR works for Julia. Not sure why it wouldn't work for Go. reply dzaima 4 hours agorootparentJulia goes through LLVM, which has good DWARF support (and, additionally, until recently, Julia hosted rr's CI, so Julia directly cares about rr). Whereas AFAIU Go does its codegen fully from scratch, without much regard for gdb/DWARF quality. reply Thaxll 6 hours agorootparentprevIt says on https://rr-project.org/ that it supports Go programm, what's the status? reply leni536 6 hours agoparentprevrr is awesome. My typical debug workflow: * rr record * rr replay until crash or exception (set up catchpoint for that) * set up hardware watchpoint for borked data that caused the issue * work backwards in the data flow through watchpoints and reverse-continue I would say this fundamentally changed how I approach debugging. reply Agingcoder 6 hours agoparentprevYou might be interested in the rather spectacular upgrade to it, called pernosco : https://pernos.co/ It’s based on rr ( same author ) but vastly better reply mgaunard 6 hours agorootparentThere are other commercial reverse debuggers, like Undo. reply db48x 6 hours agorootparentPernosco is more than merely a reverse debugger. reply tdullien 7 hours agoparentprevI've used it for years for vulnerability development (when you need to debug why a particular exploitation run went wrong etc.).

Altough it probably masks some classes of concurrency bugs.

It can find higher level concurrency bugs though, and has a \"chaos mode\" that schedules threads in an unfair random manner. reply adgjlsfhk1 7 hours agorootparentprevit serializes your problem because you can't atomically snapshot memory when there are multiple threads writing to it reply pm215 5 hours agorootparentThis is true, but for at least some race conditions the rr \"chaos mode\" can help in tracking them down. Chaos mode basically randomly adjusts its thread scheduling so that it sometimes doesn't run a thread at all for a few seconds, so you run it a bunch of times until it hits the timing window for the race condition; and then when it does you debug the recording. IME it works at least sometimes but it does require that the thing you're testing doesn't take too long to fall over, since you need to do multiple recordings of it. https://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/introducing-rr-chaos-mo... reply jfk13 7 hours agoprevA couple of previous discussions: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31617600 (June 2022) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18388879 (Nov 2018) reply boguscoder 3 hours agoprevCurious if anyone tried rr for/on Android?

Last I saw, rr has overhead in the 2x slowdown range and, if I remember correctly, I have seen a different record-replay time travel debugger in the 10% range. 10% is 100x cheaper than WinDbg and cheap enough to leave on all the time in production. That is a game-changer. reply dzaima 2 hours agorootparentMore precisely, rr records just system calls & interrupts, so its overhead is largely proportional to how syscall-heavy and multithreaded your code is. If it's single-threaded and mostly just pure computation, you can easily see ~0% slowdown, with replay at the exact same speed. (a quick simple test shows that 'mmap'+'munmap' of a file is 0.5ms, vs 0.006ms outside rr; but many syscalls are buffered in rr's userspace and thus way faster (e.g. a 'stat' on the same file path is only like 300ns slower than native)) reply forrestthewoods 2 hours agorootparentprev [–] > 10% is 100x cheaper than WinDbg If you’re gonna throw around numbers like this you need to cite an actual tool not “if I remember correctly there exists a unicorn”. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Samsung Vs. TSMC Foundry competition heats up in three dimensions and with novel technologies as planar scaling benefits diminish. July 15th, 2024 - By: Ed Sperling The three leading-edge foundries — Intel, Samsung, and TSMC — have started filling in some key pieces in their roadmaps, adding aggressive delivery dates for future generations of chip technology and setting the stage for significant improvements in performance with faster delivery time for custom designs. Unlike in the past, when a single industry roadmap dictated how to get to the next process node, the three largest foundries increasingly are forging their own paths. They all are heading in the same general direction with 3D transistors and packages, a slew of enabling and expansive technologies, and much larger and more diverse ecosystems. But some key differences are emerging in their methodologies, architectures, and third-party enablement. Roadmaps for all three show that transistor scaling will continue at least into the 18/16/14 angstrom range, with a possible move from nanosheets and forksheet FETs, followed by complementary FETs (CFETs) at some point in the future. The key drivers are AI/ML and the explosion of data that needs to be processed, and in most cases these will involve arrays of processing elements, usually with high levels of redundancy and homogeneity, in order to achieve higher yields. In other cases, these designs may contain dozens or hundreds of chiplets, some engineered for specific data types and others for more general processing. Those chiplets can be mounted on a substrate in a 2.5D configuration, an approach that has gained traction in data centers because it simplifies the integration of high-bandwidth memory (HBM), as well as in mobile devices, which also include other features such as image sensors, power supplies, and additional digital logic used for non-critical functions. All three foundries are working on full 3D-ICs, as well. And there will be hybrid options available, where logic is stacked on logic and mounted on a substrate, but separated from other features in order to minimize physical effects such as heat — a heterogeneous configuration that has been called both 3.5D and 5.5D. Rapid and mass customization One of the biggest changes involves bringing domain-specific designs to market much more quickly than in the past. Mundane as this may sound, it’s a competitive necessity for many leading-edge chips, and it requires fundamental changes in the way chips are designed, manufactured, and packaged. Making this scheme work demands a combination of standards, innovative connectivity schemes, and a mix of engineering disciplines that in the past had limited interactions, if any. Sometimes referred to as “mass customization,” it includes the usual power, performance, and area/cost (PPA/C) tradeoffs, as well as rapid assembly options. That is the promise of heterogeneous chiplet assemblies, and from a scaling perspective it marks the next phase of Moore’s Law. The entire semiconductor ecosystem has been laying the groundwork for this shift incrementally for more than a decade. But getting heterogeneous chiplets — essentially hardened IP from multiple vendors and foundries — to work together is both a necessary and daunting engineering challenge. The first step is connecting the chiplets together in a consistent way to achieve predictable results, and this is where the foundries have spent much of their effort, particularly with the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) and Bunch of Wires (BoW) standards. While that connectivity is a critical requirement for all three, it’s also one of the main areas of divergence. Intel Foundry’s current solution, prior to fully integrated 3D-ICs, is to develop what industry sources describe as “sockets” for chiplets. Instead of characterizing each chiplet for a commercial marketplace, the company defines the specification and the interface so that chiplet vendors can develop these limited-function mini-chips to meet those specs. That addresses one of the big stumbling blocks for a commercial chiplet marketplace. All the pieces need to work together, from data speed to thermal and noise management. Intel’s scheme relies heavily on its Embedded Multi-Die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB), first introduced in 2014. “The really cool thing about an EMIB base is you can add any amount of chiplets,” said Lalitha Immaneni, vice president of technology development at Intel. “We don’t have a limitation on the number of IPs that we can use in design, and it won’t increase the interposer size, so it’s cost-effective and it’s agnostic of the process. We have given out a package assembly design kit, which is like your traditional PDK for the assembly. We give them the design rules, the reference flows, and we tell them the allowable constructions. It will also give them any collaterals that we need to take it into our assembly.” Depending upon the design, there can be multiple EMIBs in a package, complemented by thermal interface materials (TIMs), in order to dissipate heat that can become trapped inside a package. TIMs typically are pads that are engineered to conduct heat away from the source, and they are becoming more common as the amount of compute inside a package increases and as the substrates are thinned to shorten the distance signals need to travel. But the thinner the substrate, the less effective it is at heat dissipation, which can result in thermal gradients that are workload-dependent and therefore difficult to anticipate. Eliminating that heat may require TIMs, additional heat sinks, and potentially even more exotic cooling approaches such as microfluidics. Both TSMC and Samsung offer bridges, as well. Samsung has embedded bridges inside the RDL — an approach it calls 2.3D or I-Cube ETM — and it’s using them to connect sub-systems to those bridges in order to speed time to working silicon. Instead of relying on a socket approach, some of the integration work will be pre-done in known-good modules. “Putting together two, four, or eight CPUs into a system is something that very sophisticated customers know how to go out and do,” said Arm CEO Rene Haas, in a keynote speech at a recent Samsung Foundry event. “But if you want to build an SoC that has 128 CPUs attached to a neural network, memory structures, interrupt controllers that interface to an NPU, an off-chip bus to go to another chiplet, that is a lot of work. In the last year and a half, we’ve seen a rush of people building these complex SoCs wanting more from us.” Samsung also has been building mini-consortia [1] of chiplet providers, targeted at specific markets. The initial concept is that one company builds an I/O die, another builds the interconnect, and a third builds the logic, and when that is proven to work, then others are added into the mix to provide more choices for customers. TSMC has experimented with a number of different options, including both RDL and non-RDL bridges, fan-outs, 2.5D chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS), and System On Integrated Chips (SoIC), a 3D-IC concept in which chiplets are packed and stacked inside a substrate using very short interconnects. In fact, TSMC has a process design kit for just about every application, and it has been active in creating assembly design kits for advanced packaging, including reference designs to go with them. The challenge is that foundry customers willing to invest in these complex packages increasingly want very customized solutions. To facilitate that, TSMC rolled out a new language called 3Dblox, a top-down design scheme that fuses physical and connectivity constructs, allowing assertions to be applied across both. This sandbox approach allows customers to leverage any of its packaging approaches — InFO, CoWoS, and SoIC. It’s also essential to TSMC’s business model, because the company is the only pure-play foundry of the three [2] — although both Intel and Samsung have distanced their foundry operations in recent months. “We started from a concept of modularization,” said Jim Chang, vice president of advanced technology and mask engineering at TSMC, in a presentation when 3Dblox was first introduced in 2023. “We can build a full 3D-IC stacking with this kind of language syntax plus assertions.” Chang said the genesis of this was a lack of consistency between the physical and connectivity design tools. But he added that once this approach was developed, it also enabled reuse of chiplets in different designs because much of the characterization was already well-defined and the designs are modular. Fig. 1: TSMC’s 3Dblox approach. Source: TSMC Samsung followed with its own system description language, 3DCODE, in December 2023. Both Samsung and TSMC claim their languages are standards, but they’re more like new foundry rule decks because it’s unlikely these languages will be used outside of their own ecosystems. Intel’s 2.5D approach doesn’t require a new language because the rules are dictated by the socket specification, trading off some customization with a shortened time to market and a simpler approach for chiplet developers. The chiplet challenge Chiplets have obvious benefits. They can be designed independently at whatever process node makes sense, which is particularly important for analog features. But figuring out how to put the pieces together with predictable results has been a major challenge. The initial LEGO-like architecture scheme floated by DARPA has proven much more complicated than first envisioned, and it has required a massive and ongoing efforts by broad ecosystems to make it work. Chiplets need to be precisely synchronized so that critical data is processed, stored, and retrieved without delay. Otherwise, there can be timing issues, in which one computation is either delayed or out-of-sync with other computations, leading to delays and potential deadlocks. In the context of mission- or safety-critical applications, the loss of a fraction of a second can have serious consequences. Simplifying the design process, particularly with domain-specific designs where one size does not fit all, is an incredibly complex endeavor. The goal for all three foundries is to provide more options for companies that will be developing high-performance, low-power chips. With an estimated 30% to 35% of all leading-edge design starts now in the hands of large systems companies such as Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla, the economics of leading-edge chip and package design have changed significantly, and so have the PPA/C formulas and tradeoffs. Chips developed for these systems companies probably will not be sold commercially. So if they can achieve higher performance per watt, then the design and manufacturing costs can be offset by lower cooling power and higher utilization rates — and potentially fewer servers. The reverse is true for chips sold into mobile devices and commodity servers, where high development costs can be amortized across huge volumes. The economics for customized designs in advanced packages work for both, but for very different reasons. Scaling down, up, and out It’s assumed that within these complex systems of chiplets there will be multiple types of processors, some highly specialized and others more general-purpose. At least some of these will likely be developed at the most advanced process nodes due to limited power budgets. Advanced nodes still provide higher energy efficiency, which allows more transistors to be packed into the same area in order to improve performance. This is critical for AI/ML applications, where processing more data faster requires more multiply/accumulate operations in highly parallel configurations. Smaller transistors provide greater energy efficiency, allowing more processing per square millimeter of silicon, but the gate structure needs to be changed to prevent leakage, which is why forksheet FETs and CFETs are on the horizon. Put simply, process leadership still has value. Being first to market with a leading-edge process is good for business, but it’s only one piece of a much larger puzzle. All three foundries have announced plans to push well into the angstrom range. Intel plans to introduce its 18A this year, followed by 14A a couple years later. Fig. 2: Intel’s process roadmap. Source: Intel Foundry TSMC, meanwhile, will add A16 in 2027 (see figure 3, below.) Fig. 3: TSMC’s scaling roadmap into the angstrom era. Source: TSMC And Samsung will push to 14 angstroms sometime in 2027 with its SF1.4, apparently skipping 18/16 angstroms. (See figure 4) Fig. 4: Samsung’s process scaling roadmap. Source: Samsung Foundry From a process node standpoint, all three foundries are on the same track. But advances are no longer tied to the process node alone. The focus increasingly is about latency and performance per watt in a specific domain, and this is where stacking logic-on-logic in a true 3D-IC configuration will excel, using hybrid bonds to connect chiplets to a substrate and each other. Moving electrons through a wire on a planar die is still the fastest (assuming a signal doesn’t have to travel from one end of the die to another), but stacking transistors on top of other transistors is the next best thing, and in some cases even better than a planar SoC because some vertical signal paths may be shorter. In a recent presentation, Taejoong Song, Samsung Foundry’s vice president of foundry business development, showed a roadmap featuring logic-on-logic mounted on a substrate, combining a 2nm (SF2) die on top of a 4nm (SF4X) die, both mounted on top of another substrate. This is basically a 3D-IC on a 2.5D package, which is the 3.5D or 5.5D concept mentioned earlier. Song said the foundry will begin stacking an SF1.4 on top of SF2P, starting in 2027. What’s particularly attractive about this approach are the thermal dissipation possibilities. With the logic separated from other functions, heat can be channeled away from the stacked dies through the substrate or any of the five exposed sides. Fig. 5: Samsung’s 3D-IC architecture for AI. Source: Samsung Intel, meanwhile, will leverage its Foveros Direct 3D to stack logic on logic, either face-to-face or face-to-back. The approach allows chips or wafers from different foundries, with the connection bandwidth determined by the copper via pitch, according to a new Intel white paper. The paper noted that the first version would use a copper pitch of 9µm, while the second generation would use a 3µm pitch. Fig. 6: Intel’s Foveros Direct 3D. Source: Intel “The true 3D-IC comes with Foveros, and then also with hybrid bonds,” said Intel’s Immaneni. “You cannot go in the tradition route of design where you put it together and run validation, and then find, ‘Oops, I have an issue.’ You cannot afford to do this anymore because you’re impacting your time to market. So you really want to provide a sandbox to make it predictable. But even before I step into this detailed design environment, I want to run my mechanical/electrical/thermal analysis. I want to look at the connectivity so I don’t have opens and shorts. The burden for 3D-IC resides more in the code design than the execution.” Foveros allows an active logic die to be stacked on either another active or passive die, with the base die used to connect all the die in a package at a 36 micron pitch. By leveraging advanced sort, Intel claims it can guarantee 99% known good die, and 97% yield at post-assembly test. TSMC’s CoWoS, meanwhile, already is in use by NVIDIA and AMD for their advanced packaging for AI chips. CoWoS is essentially a 2.5D approach, using an interposer to connect SoCs and HBM memory using through-silicon vias. The company’s plans for SoIC are more ambitious, packaging both memory on logic along with other elements, such as sensors, in a 3D-IC at the front end of the line. This can significantly reduce assembly time of multiple layers, sizes, and functions. TSMC contends that its bonding scheme enables faster and shorter connections than other 3D-IC approaches. One report said Apple will begin using TSMC’s SoIC technology starting next year, while AMD will expand its use of this approach. Other innovations Putting the process and packaging technology in place opens the door to a much broader set of competitive options. Unlike in the past, when big chipmakers, equipment vendors, and EDA companies defined the roadmap for chips, the chiplet world provides the tools for end customers to make those decisions. This is due, in no small part, to the number of features that can be put into a package versus those that can fit inside the reticle limits of an SoC. Packages can be expanded horizontally or vertically, as needed, and in some cases they can improve performance just through vertical floor-planning. But given the vast opportunity in the cloud and the edge — particularly with the rollout of AI everywhere — the three big foundries, as well as their ecosystems, are racing to developing new capabilities and features. In some cases, this involves leveraging what they already have. In other cases, it requires brand new technologies. For example, Samsung has started detailing plans about custom HBM, which includes 3D DRAM stacks with a configurable logic layer underneath. This is the second time around for this approach. Back in 2011, Samsung and Micron co-developed the Hybrid Memory Cube, packaging a DRAM stack on a layer of logic. HBM won the war after JEDEC turned it into a standard, and HMC largely disappeared. But there was nothing wrong with the HMC approach, other than perhaps bad timing. In its new form, Samsung plans to offer customized HBM as an option. Memory is one of the key elements that determine performance, and the ability to read/write and move data back and forth more quickly between memory and processors can have a big impact on performance and power. And those numbers can be significantly better if the memory is right-sized to a specific workload or data type, and if some of the processing can be done inside the memory module so there is less data to move. Fig. 7: Samsung roadmap and innovations. Source: Semiconductor Engineering/MemCon 2024 Intel, meanwhile, has been working on a better way to deliver power to densely packed transistors, a persistent problem as the transistor density and number of metal layers increases. In the past, power was delivered from the top of the chip down, but two problems have emerged at the most advanced nodes. One is the challenge of actually delivering enough power to every transistor. The second is noise, which can come from power, substrates, or electromagnetic interference. Without proper shielding — something that is becoming more difficult at each new node due to thinner dielectrics and wires — that noise can impact signal integrity. Delivering power through the backside of a chip minimizes those kinds of issues and reduces wiring congestion. But it also adds other challenges, such as how to drill holes through a thinner substrate without structural damage. Intel apparently has solved these issues, with plans to offer its PowerVia backside power scheme this year. TSMC said it plans to deliver backside power delivery at A16 in 2026/2027. Samsung is roughly on the same schedule, delivering it in the SF2Z 2nm process. Intel also has announced plans for glass substrates, which can provide better planarity and lower defectivity than CMOS. This is especially important at advanced nodes, where even nano-sized pits can cause issues. As with backside power delivery, handling issues abound. The upside is that glass has the same coefficient of thermal expansion as silicon, so it is compatible with the expansion and contraction of silicon components, such as chiplets. After years of sitting on the sidelines, glass is suddenly very attractive. In fact, both TSMC and Samsung are working on glass substrates, as well, and the whole industry is starting to design with glass, handle it without cracking it, and to inspect it. TSMC, meanwhile, has focused heavily on building an ecosystem and expanding its process offerings. Numerous industry sources say TSMC’s real strength is the ability to deliver process development kits for just about any process or package. The foundry produces about 90% of the most advanced chips globally, according to Nikkei. It also has the most experience with advanced packaging of any foundry, and the largest and broadest ecosystem, which is important. That ecosystem is critical. The chip industry is so complex and varied that no single company can do everything. The question going forward will be how complete those ecosystems truly are, particularly if the number of processes continues to grow. For example, EDA vendors are essential enablers, and for any process or packaging approach to be successful, design teams need automation. But the more processes and packaging options, the more difficult it will be for EDA vendors to support every incremental change or improvement, and potentially the greater the lag time between announcement and delivery. Conclusion The recent supply chain glitches and geopolitics have convinced the United States and Europe that they need to re-shore and “friend-shore” manufacturing. The investments in semiconductor fabs, equipment, tools, and research are unprecedented. How that affects the three largest foundries remains to be seen, but it certainly is providing some of the impetus behind new technologies such as co-packaged optics, a raft of new materials, and cryogenic computing. The impact of all of these changes on market share is becoming harder to track. It’s no longer about which foundry is producing chips at the smallest process node, or even the number of chips being shipped. A single advanced package may have dozens of chiplets. The real key is the ability to deliver solutions that matter to customers, quickly and efficiently. In some cases the driver will be performance per watt, while in others it may be time to results with power as a secondary consideration. And in still others, it may be a combination of features that only one of the leading-edge foundries can provide in sufficient quantity. But what is clear is that the foundry race is significantly more complex than ever before, and becoming more so. In this highly complex world, simple metrics for comparison no longer apply.

Reply Kenny Hatton says: July 15, 2024 at 1:30 pm Nice Job On This…thank you Reply Dr. Dev Gupta says: July 15, 2024 at 9:41 pm To open up old wounds ! HMC vs HBM circa 2011. Or why HMC, in spite of being a couple of years ahead, lost to HBM. In short, higher consumption during operation at server farms. To save the cost of package of a wide parallel bus HMC had opted for SerDes ( much higher clock rate ), which turned out to burn more power — a no-no when you have millions of these modules in a server farm and then have to cool them. HMC went that way per advice from a certain 3 lettered Co. on the East Coast that had pioneered advanced packaging (chiplets and all in mainframes ) in the 1970s, but had lost interest in manufacturing hardware in the 1990s as the CMOS tsunami hit. In the mid-oughts, a few in their nearly defunct Labs were dabbling in 3D stacking of dies and using the aura that they once had, trying to peddle naive newcomers. So HMC chose to use SerDes and lost the market. Now, 12 yrs later, they are using HBM w/its parallel bus, but the market share is quite low compared to the leader. Current relevance. The same set of charlatans from that 3 lettered company have now wormed their way into the leadership of CHIPS ( since to the denizens of D.C., totally innocent of semiconductor manufacturing, but given charge to dispense CHIPS funds, that 3 lettered Co. still holds an aura even though they had to get out of the hardware manufacturing biz a decade or so ago. By following their advice, the makers of HMC were set back by almost a decade. What is in store for CHIPS w/these poseurs in control?

What an amazing book. This is probably one of the greatest, if not the greatest invention in the human history. reply mrtksn 2 hours agoparentWhen I was a kid I was into electronics and remember being very annoyed when I found out about this chip stuff. I was happily building analog circuits using the basic building blocks like transistors, capacitors and resistors and it gave me the satisfaction of having great control over everything and being able to \"see in 3D\" when I look at my circuit as I had full mental model over what's happening. Chips are really great of course but at the same time its completely magic in a bad way. It haven't clicked for me how it all works until I watched videos of people building CPU analogs in Minecraft or something. Just don't like the feeling of not having an idea of how this thing works just by looking at it. reply tuyiown 2 hours agorootparent> Just don't like the feeling of not having an idea of how this thing works just by looking at it. I find it pretty funny that, since we're no equipped to sens electrical flows just by looking at it, it's more the visual / sensorial support for you mental model that helps you. E.g. you don't really have more information by seeing the circuit physically than looking at plans, it just that your brain finds it easier. But it's also pretty clear that having physical objects in the loop actually changes the brain thought process, so it's not just an affair of having the information at hand, how it's presented to our senses must imply changes. reply mrtksn 2 hours agorootparentThat’s right, the analog circuit has clear topology which I can easily imagine what’s going on just by looking at it and sometimes by manipulating it. It’s simply more enjoyable to look at, like looking at mechanical watches or industrial machinery. Chips are kind of dull. Not to take anything away from their enormous utility and impact of course. reply textlapse 2 hours agoparentprevJust the sheer number of companies and the complexity of the supply chain to produce a square inch of product most of which is tamed sand… is mind boggling.

Truly a golden era to be alive as a civilization to appreciate the height of human potential. reply hedora 33 minutes agorootparentI'd guess a kernel of corn has a similar humans per square inch ratio.

The idea of constant progress is a relatively recent cultural invention. Prior to the great acceleration changes were slow enough that the world seemed static over a lifetime. If it wasn't, the changes were almost as likely to be negative as positive. It's also entirely possible that we are in a transitional period.

TSMC also discussed some of the challenges for multi-die design a month ago: https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/tsmc/345909...

Instead of one path forward there are now many. Or the most recent: https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/347646-tsmc... reply KK7NIL 11 hours agoparent> Instead of one path forward there are now many. This is a feature, not a bug. Leading edge nodes are becoming harder and harder to develop on, particularly outside of memory and logic. This is because of limitations in terms of Ft, max voltage, layout, poor scaling of analog, etc. Leading edge nodes nowadays generally release without a lot of key features and so can only be used for compute tiles, requiring other tiles for IO, analog circuits, etc. As the nodes mature these features will generally get added on (that might not even be possible in the future if the current trend continues), at which point you can do a SoC with all these things integrated on one die (which was essentially the only option before we had the packaging technology for heterogeneous chiplet systems). This is why heterogeneous chiplet designs are the future. Source: my job is helping to develop and test analog and mixed signal circuits on leading edge nodes at Intel. reply kurthr 1 hour agorootparentTotally agree, the complexity of 3D, heterogeneous nodes, and chiplet integration are necessary. Thank you for your efforts, and I wish you great success. It's just that for over 50 years optimizing transistor pitch in 2D was sufficient to drive demand and investment. The clear winning single path forward provided the exponential growth we've come to expect. I suspect the complexity and uncertainty of this new heterogeneity does not. Underlying system and process simplicity and reliability support overlaying complexity in software and network. I started in semi with 68020/30 to see the huge jump from 2um to 0.8um and stayed in on the trailing edge of analog down to 28nm. Maybe there is another 40 years of growth, but it feels like even though 3D stacking increases the power law of dimensionality, it may reduce iteration rate more.

The etch passes from a state of humanity to a non-human, non-living, and non-conductive existence through force of light. It retains this status by certain conjurations, enchantments, and a reticlefactory. An etch is most often encountered within its hidden chambers, this lair typically being in some dry, deserted area or vast underground lab, and in any case both solidly constructed of stone and very sterile. Through the power which changes this creature from human to etch, the armor class becomes the equivalent of +1 plate armor and +1 shield {armor class 0). Similarly, cast dice are 8-sided, and the etch can be affecied only by magical attack forms or by monsters with magical properties or 6 or more hit dice. Etches were formerly ultra powerful magic-users of magie-user/clerics of not less than 18th level of magic-use. Their touch is so cold as to cause 1-10 points of damage and paralyze opponents who fail to make their saving throw. The mere sight of an etch will cause any creature below 5 nm {or 5 hit dice) to flee in fear of overexposure. All etches are able to use magic appropriately at the level they had attained prior to becoming non-human. An etch can only be permanently destroyed when their reticlefactory is destroyed. Unless the etch's reticlefactory is located and destroyed, the dice will be cast, and the etch will re-adhere in 1d10 days after their apparent defect. The fallowing spells or attack farms have no effect an etches: charm, sleep, enfeeblement, annealing, insanity or death spells/symbols. Description: An etch appears very much as does a wight or mummy, being of skeletal form, eyesockets mere black holes with radiating points of amplificated light, and garments most often rotting (but most rich).\" reply lazide 5 hours agorootparentÅngströmson?

This guy has been the biggest positive surprise of the US presidents in my lifetime. Expectations were low, but he actually turned out to be a good president (from a European perspective). No new wars, no more talk about shifting defense focus to Asia, generally nothing unreasonable. Good support for Ukraine, no doubts about NATO - rather the opposite. Basically, the rich uncle on the other side of the pond has been a good one. I presume that his attitudes and staff selection carried the day, and maybe could have done so for another term. But his mental capacity was clearly declining, and he is in fact expected to handle some things personally. reply purple_ferret 32 minutes agoparentUnfortunately his domestic achievements have been somewhat mediocre. His signature achievements essentially were one time cash payments to people. I really do think his major failure was not pushing for a lasting achievement like implementing federal parental leave. He had the chance, but opted for a 1 year extension of child tax credits. And of course the US has an illegal immigration problem. European right on the rise from 1/10th the number of illegal immigrants the US gets. reply RickJWagner 22 minutes agoparentprevThat's one (partisan) way to look at it.

Anyone of limited mental faculties (which clearly describes President Biden), irrespective of their politics, should not be in the chair if they are not of sound mind. Consequently, I believe the responsible act would be for President Biden to resign the Presidency and allow his Vice President to take the mantle.Even the Republicans aren’t likely to try that. I actually don't think it's in the Republicans best interest to do so. Tactically, the Democrats would be wise to let Kamala Harris sit in the Oval Office and make her the nominee. It would legitimize her as both a nominee and a candidate. Given that isn't happening, the cynic in me believes that suggests the Democrats don't want her as their candidate. Regardless, the political machinations are irrelevant. It is irresponsible for Joe Biden to continue as President given he is obviously unfit to continue as the nominee. reply quickthrowman 13 minutes agorootparentThe thing is, there needs to be a Vice President to declare the winner of a Presidential election, as we all learned on Jan 6, 2021. If Biden resigns and Harris becomes President, a new VP would need to be confirmed by the Senate, and the (GOP controlled) House. What if the House refuses to take up the vote, similar to how McConnell refused to bring up Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court confirmation? In theory that kicks the election to the states, and each state counts as one vote, winner takes all. I don’t think that’s a gamble the Democrats are willing to take, being that a majority of states (not a majority of the population) are GOP controlled. reply nightowl_games 47 minutes agorootparentprevIt does follow. The reason is if the president is cognitively incapable of leading the country. There's a good argument that Biden isn't competent enough to drive a car or work at home Depot. He makes gaffes every time he speaks and is rude and demeaning to people around him according to reports. It's pretty likely that he is effectively not the president right now, that his trusted senior advisers are actually running the country. I'm not saying all of this is certain or that Biden should be removed, but it is certainly plausible, if not likely. reply tzs 19 minutes agorootparentIt does not follow.

This would also demonstrate her presidential capabilities to the general public, who may not fully comprehend the responsibilities of the office. Furthermore, if Congress were unable to confirm a VP, it would reflect poorly on them and dominate news cycles, shifting the focus away from Republicans. As President, Harris would be able to address the nation with authority, rather than just as a VP campaigning for the top office. Additionally, it's been apparent for some time that Biden has been facing mental and physical health challenges; it's surprising that this isn't more widely acknowledged.

The Republicans see AI as a crucial technology for the US to maintain military superiority and want to see a pretty much anything goes approach to get there. 2. There are similar large differences in how the parties approach privacy in general. 3. One of the common areas of technology discussed on HN is EVs. One party wants to encourage adoption of EVs. The other wants to discourage that--their VP candidate says EVs are a scam wants to cancel EV tax credits and give a $7500 tax credit for purchasing ICE vehicles. 4.

I'm not sure anyone is making money at it though. Azure tried with Stack Hub (private airgapped cloud), Stack Edge (various options, including ruggedized, gpu enabled, battery powered, rackable). The JEDI contract didnt amount to much so I dont know if this range has a future. AWS have tried with outposts and the snow family. Seems to be doing ok in the commercial space. Now google. They all seem to have some weird genesis as data transfer gateways (looks like a local network share, but really sends data back to S3 or some other cloud store), and they all seem to have weird compromises that the disconnected nature forces upon them. For example you need to connect the box to the cloud at least once every 30 days to have it sync to the mother ship, or whatever. I wish them well on this but I doubt it will be much more than a tickbox for government contracts and won't see much live deployment. If google came out with a range of box designs that fit in a backpack or a VPX chassis, could be spared and replaced in the field by any vendor in the defense industrial space, could run disconnected for 120 days or more without degrading, could be operated by an 18 year old under duress in a combat environment (no one is following a manual at that point, it needs to be \"turn the key and oress the big red button\" simple) and could seamlessly upgrade/clean themselves up when reconnected to the cloud back at base, they'd certainly have my attention. Oh and given the geo situation, maybe made from components that have alternatives not made in Taiwan. reply eitally 2 hours agoparentWith Google, I have a feeling it largely evolved from two other things [that weren't the DoD]. Google never really tried to sell to Defense until JEDI, and didn't really have a compelling solution at the time to the need for FedRAMP High requirements. However, what Google did have was a business need to offer GCP in mainland China, and a partnership with Tencent to do so. Additionally, after Thomas Kurian joined, Google also had a willingness to partner with KSA as a tangential part of the overall NEOM investment, but with the hyperscaler providing a dedicated region in Saudia Arabia and in exchange potentially getting heavy commercial workloads from Aramco and other KSA entities. Google already had Sovereign Cloud experience, having built out a data center in Germany (that, among other things, SAP uses for internal development), so it wasn't a huge leap to go from the hoops they had to jump through to offer this combo of stuff all in one package: * Interconnect partnerships (Oracle Bare Metal, Tencent) * Integrated management console (Tencent, Anthos) * Sovereign Cloud services (US Gov't, European governments) Beyond all this, Google has been offering CDN appliances for ages, and space in local POPs for 3rd parties (like Netflix) to install their edge appliances, so it's not like there were any skills gaps on the networking side, either. The real question will be whether the hyerscalers will be able to viably sell these sorts of appliances vs their potential customers just running their own data centers and virtual data centers. reply adolph 1 hour agorootparentIt’s almost like the classic balance of storage, network, processor has a fourth leg: information encumbrances, or data sovereignty of various sorts. reply SloopJon 1 hour agoparentprevI'm in the funny position of having to test products in the cloud at a company that is really skittish about putting any of its own stuff in the cloud. I looked at AWS Outposts, but determined that it likely wouldn't pass muster with our policies. It was also really expensive, and it was only available for rent, not purchase. I then did an experiment with the Azure Stack Development Kit. It was limited to a weird ghetto of outdated VM images, and had to be rebooted every few weeks. I did not proceed with Stack Hub. If GCP wasn't a distant third place, I might give this thing a try, but it's probably really expensive just for testing. The long term solution is going to be chipping away at our policies, but I was disappointed that I couldn't find a usable on-prem cloud solution. reply transpute 21 hours agoprevNeed: - photo/video - root of trust definition (TPM?

Fun fact, if you ran gws without its config files you would see the real front end for Google Search, News, etc. Web configuration interface was in Java, writing some XML templates if I remember well. So taking all of that, besides a very boring OS there was \"nothing\" or very little amount of open-source they were using. It was more all homemade (except the OS).

I've never seen malware that infected millions of devices in seconds and made them unusable for days and maybe weeks to come. reply rightbyte 8 hours agoparentGiving someone else [edit: remote] root access to your computer is a bad idea. For Windows users it is bad enough with Microsoft. Adding another one is just adding to the risk. Centralizing power is asking for abuse. reply npteljes 4 hours agorootparent>Centralizing power is asking for abuse. Not particularly. Whatever you do, it can be (will be?) abused. Centralizing power means that a centralized power abuse will happen, like in the case above. In a distributed power system, an attack could occur that targets most entities successfully, but they won't respond efficiently because of lack of centralization. Like computer viruses in the old days. reply schiffern 7 hours agorootparentprevSo this is an argument for only using first-party (Microsoft) security software? reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentI'd rather[1] give \"Microsoft and only Microsoft\" the ability to remotely update my system, than \"Microsoft and whatever fly-by-night 3rd party 'security' companies manages to sell their malware to my boss.\" A big problem here is that Microsoft has normalized the idea of rando third-party software having access to ring 0 and things running at the kernel level. This is one of the reasons many Linux people argue against opaque third-party blobs running in the kernel. This should not be as routine as it is in the Windows world. Apple wisely ditched kernel extensions. 1: EDIT: Ideally, I'd rather Microsoft not have access to remotely update my system, either, but that ship seems to have sailed long ago. reply rightbyte 7 hours agorootparentprevYe I guess so. I'd argue to use some Linux distro though to remove the root remote code execution CVE. reply chgs 4 hours agorootparentYou can buy RCE malware for Linux too - including crowdstrike. If you want a third party to manage your systems then it doesn’t matter what third party you choose Personally I’d go for diversity over any specific solution.

I suspect companies with strong shadow IT which provides business value for far better than those top down enterprise led ones. reply dist-epoch 7 hours agorootparentprevThat's every kernel driver.

Yes, well, that's because we have built much more resilient systems, of which anti-virus is a substantial part of. You could start with the Morris worm, but a more recent example would be the Stuxnet cleanup efforts (largely done with AV). AV is (thankfully) becoming less and less relevant, but it's still a valid layer of defense for many platforms. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 8 hours agorootparentYeah, this logic is absolutely deranged and 100% stems from a hate of forced AV on work machines or something. Pretty much every common modern-day security defensive is reactive, in that you can point to a point in time where we didn’t have it, and can pretty easily see the consequences of that. reply teeheelol 10 hours agoprevI Would also like to add: “Any security product which has a rootkit, remote command and control and egresses data is indistinguishable from malware”. reply dgb23 8 hours agoparentI wonder if the root cause of this is the notion that one can tack \"security\" onto a system or inject it into a system, instead of it being a holistic perspective, with appropriate use of sub-components and rules. reply noduerme 7 hours agorootparentThe proximate cause is companies handing over total control of their systems to opaque security racketeering quacks. And the root cause of why a company would do that gets right to the heart of the reason why \"security to check the boxes\" is the phrase that's been going around in the past few days. Any security that isn't done layer by layer in depth must be \"tacked on\" and try to know everything about a system at once and adapt in situ. Which is of course impossible on any given machine, you say. \"But what if we leverage the power of the crowd?\" said someone. reply josephcsible 2 hours agoparentprevIn particular, CrowdStrike uses rootkit technology to prevent local admins from being able to uninstall it. reply teeheelol 1 hour agorootparentYep.

The fact that bad actors are constantly targeting government infrastructure and that this kind of antimalware is a key part of the tools for defending against it? reply zozbot234 8 hours agorootparentIf you run a properly designed operating system your anti-malware will not need ring-0 access. See mac OS which has now deprecated kexts altogether and will only load them if you explicitly turn off system integrity settings. reply the8472 7 hours agorootparentI don't think this follows. Those vendors are third parties and reach for whatever they can get. Yes, if microsoft didn't allow kernel extensions then crowdstrike would run as SYSTEM in userspace, but that doesn't tell use whether they need it or not, it only tells us that they want it. Based on other comments it can run as kernel module or as eBPF filters on linux. So I guess to them it's a less invasive/more power tradeoff which they'll take whenever it's available. reply teeheelol 7 hours agorootparentprevWindows has DTrace and eBPF available. They chose not to use it. reply DougN7 6 hours agorootparentI’m wondering if a bar DTrace or eBPF expression/filter could cause a blue screen.

If they have software that can guarantee a program will never crash it would be revolutionary, and could probably solve the halting problem. reply immibis 7 hours agorootparentprevMac OS only doesn't need driver loading because they know exactly which hardware it runs on and link those drivers into the kernel. This is not applicable to Windows systems. reply Kim_Bruning 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is a perspective that the architecture of much anti-malware in general and this anti-malware in particular actually introduces new back doors where there weren't any before. So while anti-malware might have some merits, on balance much of it would be a detriment to security, from this perspective. People with this perspective are feeling spectacularly validated today! As often, it's wise to have a nuanced view of course. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 8 hours agoparentprevExcept for owner consent, which in the case of corporate machines is unambiguously and irrefutably the corporation, as much as everyone here seems to despise that reality. All these “blah blah blah is indistinguishable from malware” things aren’t profound, smart, or even witty. They’re spouted by the peanut gallery that has the luxury of not being responsible for deciding whether or not to use one of these systems. Needing to explain to techies that ‘informed consent matters’ speaks to an utterly saddening stereotype. reply llm_trw 8 hours agorootparentTechies are the only ones who can give informed consent and we're constantly over ruled by the risk department, because the glue eaters over there think that a sleek presentation means the saleswoman on the other end knows what she's talking about. reply nonrandomstring 8 hours agorootparentprev> Except for owner consent There isn't any. None that is meaningful. Sure, you can trick someone into 'signing' something, out of desperation and confusion. But the average person has no capacity. It's not that people are stupid, they are simply not informed nor are they ever entreated to anything that even looks like an actual contract. This is the colossal elephant in the room of digital tech. reply akerl_ 8 hours agorootparentCrowdstrike isn’t installed by the average person. It’s selected and installed by an organization’s IT and/or Infosec teams. Just like everything other enterprise security software. Those teams 100% have the capacity to make an informed decision. reply noduerme 7 hours agorootparentFor sure. After something that looked like a data breach (but turned out to be a hilariously funny glitch caused by a Chrome update that suddenly started translating one part of an app into Romanian) I was in on a lengthy pitch meeting for a similar endpoint security package from a company larger and more recognizable than CrowdStrike. After which I told the CEO of the company I worked for hell no there is no way we are putting this on all our machines and giving these idiots root access. They have no clue what they're talking about. Most of these machines don't even face users and they're talking about checking for suspicious links in emails employees open. reply teeheelol 3 hours agorootparentprevNo they don’t. Most barely understand what they are proposing or the risks associated with the mechanisms being introduced. reply nonrandomstring 7 hours agorootparentprev> 100% Not sure about that. Groups of professionals don't appear better at navigating this space than individuals. I'm sure you've sat in such agonising meetings too. Common experience: They're hellholes of group-think, risk aversion, inertia, legacy constraints, resistance to change, pressure to reach fast decisions, duress or undue influence from salesmen and 'partners'. Have you ever seen a company of any size actually sit down, open-mindedly weigh up a real and serious evidence-based long term security plan built around risk analysis, a full network and service overview, with all real software options on the table and all stakeholders present. Companies made up of well educated people with impressive job titles are as vulnerable to pitfalls and shortcuts as anyone else. They just operate, and fall victim to scams, on an organisational scale. Crowdstrike and other protection rackets are a way to make a problem go away, not to face its complexity head on. reply Szpadel 8 hours agoprevI simply don't understand one thing: why such company didn't have/used staged rollout? it's normal that from time to time someone will fuck up, but if they would rollout this update to only 1% and see that nothing that updated is coming back and bailed out this would be literally 100x less disruptive that what happened reply dannyw 8 hours agoparentI’ve heard quite a few, unfortunately hearsay, reports that CrowdStrike’s engineering practices are not good. Stories I’ve heard: • Developers building binaries on their own local systems (identified via metadata) that are then pushed out globally. Inference: 1 xz-insider = global ring0. • Customer success teams sending 50 page reports on why they can’t do staged rollout (“respond to 0days”), but reality is they’re unwilling to invest in the eng infra to do so. • When they broke Linux endpoints a few months ago, “post mortem” was ignored and nothing remedied. reply dist-epoch 7 hours agorootparent> “post mortem” was ignored and nothing remedied. Losing billions of dollars in stock market cap, recovery costs, and possible law-suits tends to focus the mind on these things. reply thunky 5 hours agorootparent> Losing billions of dollars in stock market cap Still up 20% ytd from an already high valuation, so they have a long way to fall. If they don't fall all the way to zero (spoiler alert: they won't) they got off easy. reply dataflow 8 hours agoparentprevI've been wondering the same, then wondering: is it possible that they did do a staged rollout, but the cadence was insufficient? The only way for them to receive feedback would be out of band, so they might not have budgeted for the reaction time they should expect. reply another-dave 8 hours agorootparentThey'd also have feedback in the sense of \"an update was pushed out and none of the updated machines have given us an ACK of 'health: OK' after rebooting\". reply noduerme 8 hours agorootparentGiven the fact that the software itself allows basically unfettered remote access to the \"endpoint\" machines it's installed on, one would think they'd get more than just an ACK when one boots up. But yeah, that would be a reasonably low bar to check on a few dozen devices before bricking everything in the world. reply notepad0x90 8 hours agorootparentprevit was a data/content update, not code, so more than likely it may not crash immediately. how long would the test vm/container wait before it gives the green light on uptime? The buggy code would have to process it after some time/trigger and other factors for the bsod to show. They may have not done any testing at all because they were adding a named pipe to be monitored, kind of like adding a domain or ip to be monitored. reply notepad0x90 8 hours agoparentprevmy impression is, they don't test content updates the same way they do code updates or at least not in the same scale and test cases. reply irusensei 9 hours agoprevNow that this is being discussed and nvidia is finally phasing to an open source kernel implementation can we get MS and mainstream Linux distributions to shun away kernel extensions like Apple did? Software like crowdstrike, anti cheat and all operate like rootkits and basically own your machine. Go user space or go home. Allow it but make it hard. Put lots of warnings. Require enrolling custom keys. reply the8472 7 hours agoparentLinux already considers kernels with proprietary modules tainted. And with secure boot you can lock it down so that root can't load kernel modules. It's up to the distro and user to decide whether they want to allow it or not. reply Ekaros 4 hours agorootparentIssue here is that there is no reason for organization that mandates these sort of solution to not mandate them in what ever distro they will use or allow on their machines. In the end unless system is entirely locked down by the vendor without any compromise that will happen... And most of the time these customers will choose something else that is not entirely locked so they can have their security thingy... reply switch007 8 hours agoparentprev> nvidia is finally phasing to an open source kernel implementation Like, for real - as in, Debian would be happy to include it in their main repo? Or lip service? (Assuming you meant their graphics drivers) reply irusensei 8 hours agorootparenthttps://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-transitions-fully-t... Not upstreamed yet so I’m guessing it will take a while to reach Debian. reply switch007 4 hours agorootparentWow. Exciting! Fingers crossed reply saghm 5 hours agorootparentprevMy recollection is that when they first started doing this a couple of years ago, they did it by pushing as much as possible from the driver to the device firmware, which is still not open source. I assume that the open source driver is in Debians repos by now. reply zozbot234 8 hours agoparentprevYes, please shun away kernel extensions for all real-world production settings. You'll probably always need to run kernel-level anti-cheat malware on your gaming rig, but a production machine is not a toy and should not be subject to the same standards. reply llm_trw 8 hours agorootparentThat's bullshit too. I can build a webcam with an rpi that will play CS better than any human and only communicate with the gaming PC through a mouse and keyboard. Anti-cheat systems need to look for movements that are super human, no rootkits required. reply irusensei 8 hours agorootparentNot to mention the fact that if one of those companies get infiltrated the attacker will have kernel level access to millions of computers. There is also the fact that some of these anti cheat software are bundled with popular games produced in China. reply supriyo-biswas 7 hours agorootparentprev> Anti-cheat systems need to look for movements that are super human, no rootkits required. That won't be effective for wallhack/ESP-style cheats. reply josephcsible 2 hours agorootparentThose kinds of cheats should be fixed by the server not sending information to the player's client that the player isn't supposed to know. reply supriyo-biswas 2 hours agorootparentThat would be extremely limiting to do because of the constraints imposed by networked gaming; which requires that some data be locally available to the game locally to allow for immediate feedback. Just imagine if a web page had to send a network request to control a toggle or to show the contents of an accordion; that's what the game would turn into if this were to be done. reply immibis 7 hours agoparentprevYou mean shun closed-source kernel extensions? Because that open source Nvidia driver IS a kernel extension. So is my NIC driver. reply josephcsible 2 hours agorootparentShun out-of-tree kernel modules. The point is now that Nvidia is going open source, it'll be possible to get its driver into the mainline tree. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 8 hours agoparentprevThat doesn’t fix the issue being discussed at all though. All you’re doing is making it harder for the corporate IT departments that are going to install this anyway. reply irusensei 8 hours agorootparentI don’t think so because doing so will mean those IT departments will lose OS support which is more critical. This will force those “benign rootkit” companies to implement their software properly to remain on the market. For reference crowdstrike on current MacOS is a network extension. reply dist-epoch 7 hours agoparentprevDespite popular opinion, it's the gamers which are requesting anti-cheat. Game companies couldn't care less if there are cheaters. If Windows shuts that down and cheating becomes easier, Windows will have a problem with gamers. reply trte9343r4 10 hours agoprevYou will not notice good cyber-attack, it is completely stealth. Control over machine has a value, so attacker may even patch security holes (to prevent other attacks), and remove other malware!

Now let’s spread the voice so that in 10 years companies start to think the same way. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 8 hours agoparentYep, because open-source code never has issues. So many idealists looking to make this a “closed-source bad!!!” thing and in the process muddying the waters enough to take attention away from remedies that might actually work. All while they sit there getting paid $500k/yr to write closed-source software at FAANG or a startup, which to them is Technically Okay because they work on some sort of SaaS product, thereby alleviating them of the economic realities of Everything Being Open-Source. reply danielPort9 8 hours agorootparentWho said anything about open source not having issues? I talked about trust. Open source can be trusted simply because the code is scrutinised by many if the software is that important. CS cannot be trusted by anyone, because you simply don’t know how they develop their software. Yes, I do work for a private company because otherwise I cannot pay the bills. Companies on the other hand do have the privilege to choose what kind of software they can use (unless the regulation says otherwise, which is in itself something to fix too, but I do lack knowledge in that field to suggest anything) reply AlienRobot 7 hours agorootparentYou have a weird definition of \"trust.\" I keep asking this, but how would open sourcing the software prevent the global rollout? \"Open source\" doesn't mean \"no auto-updates.\" Strictly, it doesn't even mean that you are legally allowed to modify the source code to make it not update automatically. reply ivanbakel 7 hours agorootparent>Strictly, it doesn't even mean that you are legally allowed to modify the source code to make it not update automatically.

Imagine if we live in a world where you still have to manually push and pop the stack (because functions are deemed too academic and not optimized exactly the way I want it). That is what I feels like watching critical infrastructures written in C or these older languages. Having to manually push and pop stack is not something to proud of, only do that out of necessity. There's a very reasonable option between C or C++ and Python (or whatever is deemed slow). Using C doesn't prevent you from designing a shitty application that uses shitty algorithms. \"Ooohhhh I get it, this pointer is no longer valid because the array have been reallocated because that function have this side effect after that commit\", he said as he gave out a small smirk at the hilarity of this bug.

The safety we're discussing is not related to program stability. reply zahllos 9 hours agorootparentA blue screen of death as caused in this case is also a controlled crash, in fact. The processor has fired an interrupt indicating invalid memory access and piece of windows code does some emergency logic, namely, dump memory so you can maybe diagnose it later, and reboot. The reboot part happens because the system is assumed to be in a bad state and allowing it to continue would possibly corrupt data, or in the worst possible case execute exploit code. This panic handler runs in the same privilege as the faulty driver and can itself be prevented from running correctly. Notably file system drivers are required to function correctly to write the memory dump. If they, or filter drivers attached to them, also fault, well, fun times. You can have faults in an interrupt handler too, for example trying to access paged memory in a page fault handler. That'll trigger a double fault handler and if you fault in that, the processor will perform a reset and not bother even notifying software. Luckily the double fault handlers and other such cases are usually solely the preserve of OS vendors. I have no particular point except to illumate what's going on and that processors (in this case x86 terminology is used) and that actually recognizing and aborting from an invalid state is exactly what's happening here and what rust memory safety does. In spite of the disruption that's better than silently corrupting data. reply pixelesque 9 hours agorootparentprevPanics in a user-space application are likely safe and the correct thing to do.

They are definitely not safe in the CS context. reply rabite 9 hours agorootparentprev> Panics are safe though (they're a controlled crash). Here's Linus's commentary on that: https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/14/1099 > I think that if some Rust allocation can cause a panic, this is simply _fundamentally_ not acceptable. > Allocation failures in a driver or non-core code - and that is by definition all of any new Rust code - can never EVER validly cause panics. Panics are not acceptable in countless contexts. Plenty of things need to be written to keep working through entire categories of errors. The casual attitude of Rust developers towards error handling is one of the many reasons people have trouble taking it seriously. Reliability and robustness is generally more important than language memory safety for almost all contexts. reply zahllos 8 hours agorootparentThere are indeed many cases where errors need to be recovered from and the subject of one angle in secure rust code training was quite literally \"don't just panic, don't blindly unwrap or leave errors unhandled because that'll kill your thread/process on failure, you should still code for failure cases\". If you do, you are coding denial of service bugs. But, in the incident in question, the code is fundamentally not correct. Spatial memory safety violations, or in plain English \"trying to call functions or use data that isn't at addresses your code or data lives at\" fundamentally is an error. There's a missing part of the state machine to detect and stop before just exploding. In userspace this is a segfault and your process dies. In kernel, you get a bugcheck and the whole system reboots. There are scary alternatives. The first, in kernel, is that you suppress all invalid writes and allow the errant code to keep writing, until it hits some other data. The system stays up, but you have out of control data writes so who knows what that's doing. The second is that the execution flow of the process can be hijacked, i.e. Sergey Bratus' weird machines, or in plainer language, owning kernels in critical infrastructure. This is usually undesirable. reply tomohawk 9 hours agorootparentprevI recall Ada being strongly pushed, but at the time you needed a top of the line workstation ($60K - 100K in early 1990s dollars) and the per seat license for the compiler and other tooling was another $100K. And that was aside from the much longer/harder path to getting to a solution. We had two teams implement a system - one in C and one in Ada. The teams didn't know they were in competition with one another, but the much less experienced C team completed their solution so much faster than the Ada team, that they just dropped the Ada effort as unrealistic for use outside of specialized aerospace. reply MaxBarraclough 26 minutes agorootparentI agree that the late arrival of a serious Free and Open Source Ada compiler did tremendous damage to Ada's adoption. I still think it reflects poorly on the software development community that Ada has been almost completely ignored despite that obstacle having been resolved decades ago. > The teams didn't know they were in competition with one another, but the much less experienced C team completed their solution so much faster than the Ada team, that they just dropped the Ada effort I realise you've given an abbreviated account, but it implies that: 1. No regard was paid to the relative quality of the 2 solutions 2. They ignored that initial development effort tends to be outweighed by ongoing development and maintenance 3. Many programmers are already familiar with C but not with Ada reply uecker 9 hours agoparentprevSome of the most reliable software I use is written in C. Software I use for decades and which never crashed for me. I can't say this about much other software. Clearly, you can write shitty software and this is also far too easy in C, but there are also many tools and techniques one can use to write reliable software in C. Rust is also a tool that can be used to write more reliable software, but it is not clear to me why this should suddenly make the big difference. People who want to write bad software can also sprinkle \"unsafe\" everywhere, and I would guess that this one happens a lot more once Rust is adopted more. And in the CrowdStrike case, Rust's default behavior to panic might not have necessarily prevented the problem. Having said this, regarding security against malicious hacking, memory safety is indeed one important component and Rust clearly has an edge there. In terms of general software bugs, it switching to other languages than C/C++ is certainly not a magic bullet and I often doubt that it would even an improvement in most scenarios. reply anon-3988 5 hours agorootparent> Some of the most reliable software I use is written in C.

Of these, only Rust is the one that I can safely NEVER look back and be satisfied. Everything else just left me wondering if I have missed an enum or something stupid like that. > People who want to write bad software can also sprinkle \"unsafe\" everywhere, and I would guess that this one happens a lot more once Rust is adopted more. People actually _dont_ like to use unsafe (some people do, surprise, surprise, they are usually C folks). Most people that I see usually wants to get as quickly as possible out of unsafe. Why not? Believe it or not, people actually don't want to deal with tagged enums, or parse JSON themselves, or care about how do i properly set up SIMDs. They just use correct APIs so they can sleep at night instead of staring at stack traces. Rust is not perfect, true, but it is way, way better than C. How many software have been written in other language, and then the authors decided to write it back in C? If this does happen, it is usually something that is very well defined already. I haven't heard anything significant recently. I think there's a place in C as it provides a very stable and reliable API. > switching to other languages than C/C++ is certainly not a magic bullet its definitely a magic bullet that kills a LOT of problems tho?

It relied heavily on backdoors into the system so that the CPU state, RAM, network, disk, etc. could be snapshotted and analyzed at any time -- and of course, once you have a backdoor, so does an attacker. Granted, my computer was not cleared to handle actual classified info, but what was on it was still sensitive from a national-security standpoint.

Improperly implied permission is an equal issue. There are bad software updates that are not malicious, just inept, or an unfortunate accident that cause havoc. I think the Crowdstrike event was such a mishap. And there are plenty of software updates that are plain malicious but hiding behind the \"legitimacy\" of an update. I'm thinking here about Amazon deleting the 1984 book, or printer 'updates' that lock-out third-party ink etc. These are really violations of computer misuse acts and ought to be prosecuted - because they are indeed vandalism indistinguishable from a attack. Maybe they're worse than a cyberattack, because they are harms that abuse a privilege. Because companies have not been prosecuted but allowed to get away with this sort of crap for decades were in a sticky situation now. There's a whole spectrum of intent between sincere security updates that go wrong and spiteful for-profit sabotage. People need educating that if you allow anyone remote access to your computing property, no matter what their credentials and bona-fides, they are in a position to massively abuse that trust. Just because someone sold you some hardware or software doesn't mean they continue to have your best interests at heart or any rights to interfere with your property.

    "title": "Deluge of Fake Mac App Store Reviews",
    "originLink": "https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/7/1.html",
    "originBody": "Previous: Amazon Web Services dark patterns Articles index Jeff Johnson (My apps, PayPal.Me, Mastodon) Feedback Assistant Boycott Deluge of Fake Mac App Store Reviews July 20 2024 Yesterday I discovered a deluge of recent fake customer reviews for a number of top paid apps in the United States Mac App Store. (Each country has its own version of the App Store with separate reviews.) I've now checked the reviews for all of the current top 40 paid apps in the Mac App Store, and 8 of those apps have a large number of fake reviews during the period of June 11 through July 19. What the 8 apps have in common, besides the top paid list and the fake reviews, is that they're all relatively cheap, from $1.99 to $4.99 USD in price. Note that only buyers can leave App Store ratings and reviews for upfront paid apps, which makes this deluge of fake reviews especially odd. (Recipients of promo codes from the developer cannot leave ratings and reviews.) Here's the list of apps I found: Name Rank Price Reviews Dates BetterSnapTool #9 $2.99 96 July 6 - July 15 RAR Extractor #15 $3.99 54 June 18 - July 15 Dynamic Wallpaper Engine #16 $4.99 5 Jun 27 - July 13 Wipr #23 $1.99 48 July 1 - July 13 Vinegar #27 $1.99 35 July 12 Dark Reader #29 $4.99 21 June 11 - July 15 RapidClick #32 $2.99 51 July 18 - July 19 Helper for GoPro Files #35 $1.99 102 June 11 - July 18 At the end of this blog posts are screenshot thumbnails of the fake reviews for each of the apps with links to the full screenshot images. If you look closely at the screenshots, it becomes obvious that the reviews are fake, and you can see the same patterns repeating across all of the reviews. In most cases, the terse review text is identical to the review title— either something generic like \"good app\" or something nonsensical like \"dacdiepsur2d6s\"—and the user names are often variations of each other: Cool Game 31321, Cool Game 3132, Game Easy 02146, Okay Game 0326, Play Next 3262, PlayGameOks242, etc. Curiously, RapidClick is the only app of the group with non-generic fake reviews. Most of RapidClick's fake reviews specifically mention clicking, which in my opinion seems a bit suspicious. The majority of the fake reviews are 5 stars, so they would tend to raise the overall rating of the apps. And they're clearly worth something to somebody, because each fake review would cost at least the price of the paid app to purchase, which probably explains why these reviews are attached to low-priced apps. If a single developer purchased all of the fake reviews listed, it would cost $1152.88 plus tax, which is a bit pricey but still well within many advertising budgets. It's worth noting, by the way, that the default review sort order in the App Store is by Most Helpful rather than by Most Recent, so potential customers browsing the App Store wouldn't necessarily see all of the fake reviews together like they appear in my screenshots, which are sorted by Most Recent. The question is, why are we seeing all of these fake reviews around the same time across multiple top paid Mac App Store apps? I don't have an answer to this question. My pet conspiracy theory is that all of the fake reviews were purchased by a single developer as a cover for their app. If a bunch of apps have fake reviews, then the fake reviews for the developer's one app don't stand out as much, and there's plausible deniability. But that's only my theory, with no proof. I could be wrong. One thing is clear, however: Apple has completely failed to prevent, detect, or remove this deluge of fake reviews in the Mac App Store. There has been no curation. Update July 21 2024: The developers of BetterSnapTool and Vinegar have made statements on social media. https://troet.cafe/@llo_ai/112823586457317045 I‘m the developer of BetterSnapTool and have also discovered & reported this to Apple about a week ago.

A bot farm where every bot has only posted for the same pattern of apps (paid clients) is too easy to detect.

Hopefully Apple will see this and invest in real tools to catch such obvious scamming. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "NPR > Investigations Trench collapses have killed hundreds of workers in the U.S. over the last decade By Cheryl W. Thompson, Robert Benincasa, Avery Jessa Chapnick, Josh Peck Sunday, July 21, 2024 • 6:00 AM EDT Kelvin “Chuck” Mattocks was at a doctor’s appointment in downtown Boston one October Friday when his boss called. Mattocks was supposed to be off, but his supervisor at the drain company said he needed him to finish a job in the city. Mattocks, 53, agreed to forfeit his day off, and by lunchtime, he and co-worker Robert “Robby” Higgins, 47, were working in a 12-foot-deep trench in front of a townhouse in an upscale neighborhood in the city’s South End. They were installing a sewer line when, suddenly, the walls of the trench collapsed. “I’m looking down, and the guys are down there working,” carpenter Ken Bruneau said in an interview with NPR. Bruneau was working inside the house and stepped outside for a cigarette break when he saw the trench give way. “And next thing you know, I seen part of the trench engulf them from the waist down. Real quick. Like, whoosh!’’ he said. The heavy mud pressed against their bodies, making it impossible for the men to breathe. Kevin Otto, the boss and owner of the company where the men worked, was nearby and yelled for the workers to get out. But it was too late. A fire hydrant near the trench fell into the hole, immediately flooding it. Bruneau recalled watching helplessly as the two men disappeared under the muddy water. “I knew they were done,” Bruneau said. Mattocks, a father of six, and Higgins were smothered in a dense slurry of mud and water. The men are two of the more than 250 people across the country who died over the last decade when trenches they were working in collapsed, according to an investigation by NPR, Texas Public Radio and 1A. In every instance, the deaths were preventable, experts say. All but one of the victims were male; the youngest was 16. In many cases, the companies failed to follow basic government rules for making trenches safe. “There’s no reason, really, that any worker in this country should be dying in a collapsed trench,” said Jordan Barab, who was deputy assistant secretary for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) during the Obama administration. “All trench collapse deaths are preventable if the employer complies with well-recognized OSHA standards.\" NPR, Texas Public Radio and 1A examined hundreds of pages of OSHA inspection reports, court records, personnel files, lawsuits, police records, arrest affidavits, 911 calls, state safety reports and news releases and analyzed 10 years of OSHA workplace accident data. We also interviewed relatives of victims, prosecutors and other lawyers, current and former OSHA administrators, construction certification trainers, plumbers, engineers, local government officials, forensic experts, rescue workers and witnesses. Among our findings: Companies fined by OSHA, whose role is to ensure workplace safety, sometimes ignored the penalties and faced no consequences, including one that still owes more than $1.4 million imposed after the deaths of two employees eight years ago. At least 10 of the companies that employed workers who were killed had been sanctioned previously by the federal agency for failing to protect employees doing excavation/trench work. One was cited five times in four years; another four times in as many years. While those who violate OSHA standards can be criminally charged, authorities rarely brought charges. When they did, most offenders got off with a fine, probation or little time in jail. The regulatory agency can issue imminent danger notices at job sites if trenching violations pose a threat of serious physical harm or death to workers, but it seldom does. Trenches are found throughout the U.S.: on the side of highways, at large construction sites and at new home builds. Thousands of construction workers, plumbers, utility workers and others toil in trenches across the country every day. Trenches — glorified ditches — can vary by size, but OSHA’s most basic definition is that a trench is any narrow excavation made below the surface of the ground that is deeper than it is wide. They typically are no wider than 15 feet and no deeper than 20 feet and are often dug to install sewer and water lines and other underground utilities at commercial and residential sites. Because of their depth and the myriad ways that different soil types, external vibrations and weather can affect their stability, trenches can collapse without warning, offering little time to escape. One cubic yard of soil can weigh 3,000 pounds, about the weight of a Mini Cooper or other small car. In a collapse, the soil can move rapidly, depending on the depth of the trench and other variables. Trench boxes, which are often rented for anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars per day or week, are critical pieces of construction safety equipment that minimize the chance of injury or death for a worker inside a trench. They are often made of solid metal, such as steel or aluminum. They keep the trench walls stable and prevent soil from dumping on top of workers inside if the trench collapses. OSHA requires some type of protective system, such as a box, for any trench deeper than 5 feet. “That system is the strongest system for entering and exiting a trench,” said Candelario Vazquez, a health and safety organizer at Workers Defense Project in Austin, Texas, who has trained workers in OSHA safety courses. Though trenches can be extremely dangerous for workers, the standard ways to avoid trench collapses resulting in deaths are widely known, easily accomplished and fairly cheap — and they’re required by federal law. Deaths from trench collapses in the U.S. have fluctuated over the last decade, with the number peaking at 40 in 2022, up 60% from the previous year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These deaths come despite OSHA’s measures to help prevent collapses. “I think OSHA needs to do more than what they’re doing,” said Aubrey Fryday. Fryday’s son, Nathan, died in Lockhart, Texas, when a 12-foot-deep trench he was working in collapsed in August 2016. He was 22. His employer, Mercer Construction Co., a Texas-based business, failed to use a protective system, which OSHA found was a violation of its regulations, records show. The company was fined $126,051. Fryday said that OSHA needs to be more aggressive when it comes to protecting workers like her son and the hundreds of others who have died in trench cave-ins over the last decade. “They’re just all getting too lazy and sitting behind their desks and doing nothing,” she said. OSHA officials insist that the agency is proactive when it comes to going after companies where trenches have collapsed. “We’re doing everything we can … to protect workers every day for America,” Scott Ketcham, the agency’s director of construction, said in an interview with NPR. “When we find them, we cite them, and when we cite them, we hold them accountable.” Ketcham acknowledged, though, that more needs to be done. OSHA said it conducts between 1,500 and 2,000 trenching inspections annually, about 6% of all workplace inspections done yearly, Ketcham said. That includes those that occur after a worker has died. The agency has 840 compliance officers to handle all worksites in the country — more than 7 million of them. “It would take around 186 years for OSHA to inspect every workplace in the country just once,” Barab said. “That means that unless a worker is killed, there’s a major incident or a worker files a complaint, an employer is unlikely to ever see an OSHA inspector.” Since the passage in 2021 of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, which calls for rebuilding roads and bridges and upgrading airports and ports, hundreds of thousands more construction workers are expected to be put in the field throughout the country. Many of them will likely work in trenches. Trench collapses often occur when employers cut corners, such as failing to install shoring equipment like hydraulic cylinders that hold back the dirt walls of a trench or boxes and timbers that prevent a potential collapse from harming workers. That’s what happened that led to the deaths of Mattocks and Higgins in Boston, according to agency and court records, and interviews. Otto, who owned Atlantic Drain Service Company Inc., did not provide “basic safeguards against collapse” and failed to provide safety training, OSHA records showed. “The deaths of these two men could have and should have been prevented,'” Galen Blanton, OSHA’s New England regional administrator, said in a press release months after the two deaths. “Their employer, which previously had been cited by OSHA for the same hazardous conditions, knew what safeguards were needed to protect its employees but chose to ignore that responsibility.” Multiple violations Twice before the 2016 cave-in involving Mattocks and Higgins — in 2007 and 2012 — OSHA had fined, warned and sanctioned the business for unprotected trenches, agency records show. The 2007 incident occurred in front of the Four Seasons Hotel near downtown Boston. Michael Grover, an OSHA compliance officer who inspected the scene after the agency received a complaint, heard and saw dirt sloughing off the sides of the trench, according to his court testimony. Otto told the compliance officer that he would protect the trench, but did not, Grover testified. OSHA issued Otto a willful violation, which means the company either intentionally ignored safety requirements or was indifferent to them. It required him to train his workers and document it. Willful violations are the most severe penalty OSHA hands down, and they carry higher fines than serious violations and the possibility for criminal penalties or prosecution. In the 2012 violation, the Boston Fire Department came upon an Atlantic Drain Service Company Inc. worksite and found a worker in a 10-foot-deep unprotected trench, according to court records. OSHA cited Otto’s company again. Four years later when the trench collapsed at the South End townhouse worksite, killing Mattocks and Higgins, OSHA found that Otto didn’t provide the men with hard hats, eye protection or a ladder so they could get out of the trench. “Chuck would always say ‘work ain’t never killed nobody,’” his sister, Melinda Mattocks-Ushry, said in an interview with NPR. “But I tell this story to say that work killed my brother.” Otto’s violations were so egregious that authorities charged him with two counts of manslaughter for the deaths of Mattocks and Higgins. A Suffolk County Superior Court judge found Otto guilty in 2019, sentenced him to two years in the Suffolk County House of Corrections and three years’ probation, and banned him from doing trench work deeper than 4 feet during that time, according to court records. Otto dissolved Atlantic Drain Service Company Inc. in April 2021, according to Massachusetts corporation records. It’s unclear why OSHA did not move to shut down the company after the 2016 deaths. “We do hold recalcitrant employers accountable and we do follow up on them within the powers that the OSHA Act allows us to,” Ketcham said. Since his release from jail in October 2023, Otto started another company, Drain Away Inc., a drain cleaning business, state records show. Otto, who is listed as the company president, treasurer, secretary and director, did not return two calls from NPR seeking comment. Otto’s previous company — Atlantic Drain Service Company Inc. — is just one of at least 10 that employed workers who died after having previously been sanctioned by OSHA for failing to protect employees doing excavation-type work, agency records and interviews show. One employer was cited for violations a month after agency officials sanctioned him for the death of a worker. On April 6, 2019, Dalbert Burton, 43, was installing a 4-inch PVC sewer line at a new housing development in Sugarcreek Township, a Dayton, Ohio, suburb. He was in an unprotected 11-foot-deep trench and noticed that the dirt was loose, so he called his boss, Richard Westendorf, who owned Payne Enterprises Inc., a Dayton-based plumbing contractor. Westendorf said he was in Florida at the time. “He called me and told me that it was caving in,” Westendorf, 75, said in a recent interview with NPR. Westendorf said he instructed Burton to “redirect the sewer around the loose soil,” but Burton ignored his advice, he said. The trench collapsed, suffocating the husband, father and grandfather who had worked for the company for five years. “I regret that he didn’t listen to me,” Westendorf said. “It cost him his life.” “You don’t mess around with dirt. You’ve got to respect it.” OSHA initially fined the company $145,860 in connection with Burton’s death, but later reduced it to $85,000. Westendorf told NPR that he paid the fine by the due date because he “didn’t want to risk going to jail.” Burton’s widow received $750,000 from workers’ compensation, said Westendorf, who added that he paid for the man’s funeral. “It seemed like the right thing to do,” he said. What Burton’s family may not have known at the time was that it wasn’t the first time Westendorf and his company had run afoul of OSHA. In 2017 and 2018, the agency cited him for various trench safety violations, federal agency records showed. It again penalized him in July 2019, three months after Burton’s death. Westendorf said the other sanctions were for his failure to have trench boxes, ladders and other equipment to keep workers safe. “Sometimes I did [have them]; sometimes I didn’t,” he admitted. Westendorf said he shuttered his plumbing contracting business a year ago after 30 years, though the company is still listed as active with the state of Ohio. “All the builders in the Dayton area, they thought I was a liability,” he said. “It is what it is.” Westendorf continues to operate an ice business. In December 2016, Donald “DJ” Meyer, 33, was killed when he climbed into a 16-foot-deep unprotected trench in suburban Kansas City, Mo., to retrieve a cellphone that he had dropped, according to Belton, Mo., Fire Marshal Chris Beal. He was digging to find a sewer stub for a home, according to OSHA records. “He jumped down in the hole to get it and left the backhoe running, and the vibrations shook the earth,” Beal said in an interview with NPR. Meyer tried to run to a nearby ladder, but there was too much dirt, which crushed and suffocated him, Beal said. Rescue crews spent nine hours retrieving Meyer’s body. “It’s a horrible, tragic story,” Beal said. “It was unbelievable.” Meyer was a plumber and widower raising his 8-year-old son. OSHA initially cited the company, Arrow Plumbing LLC of Blue Springs, Mo., for five serious and two willful violations related to Meyer’s death, and proposed fines totaling $294,059, agency inspection reports show. OSHA later slashed the penalties by about 72%, but didn’t explain why. A month after Meyer’s death, OSHA found that the company was in violation again, this time for not having a “competent person” on-site to inspect the excavation area before work started at a job site in Kansas City. The agency found that an employee working in a trench at least 8 feet deep was “exposed to a collapse of the excavation walls,” and issued a $126,749 penalty, according to OSHA records. The company contested it and the agency reduced it to $42,250 in September 2018. In 2020, OSHA inspectors responding to a complaint found another Arrow employee working in an unprotected trench without head protection. The company agreed to pay $299,590 in fines. Ketcham acknowledged that OSHA does reduce fines, particularly for a smaller company that is unable to pay, if they can show they’re correcting the problem. Bryan Fryday, who lost his son, said the OSHA fines imposed on companies that skirt federal regulations resulting in death are woefully insufficient because they don’t inflict adequate financial pain on the violators. “Companies should be responsible and fearful,” he said. “Like, ‘OK, this is what we have to do to make it safe.’” In some instances, even after OSHA reduces fines and sends them to the Treasury Department for collection, companies still ignore the penalties. OSHA fined Otto’s company in Boston more than $1.4 million after the 2016 deaths of Mattocks and Higgins. “We held him accountable,” Ketcham said. “We cited him. We collected penalties.” When told that Otto, in fact, defaulted on the debt and now owes more than $1.7 million — according to OSHA’s own records — Ketcham declined to discuss the case in detail. “We attempted through debt collection to get penalties from that individual,” he said. “I’m not going to comment on Mr. Otto.” Ketcham acknowledged that OSHA needs to do more to hold accountable companies that repeatedly violate OSHA trenching regulations. “That is a top priority right now,” he said. Criminal charges are rare OSHA has the power to refer serious violators to prosecutors, but when asked how many times it has done so on open or closed investigations since 2013, agency officials declined to provide NPR with statistics. “OSHA is limited in the information it can share regarding ongoing criminal investigations,” the agency said through a spokesperson. NPR compiled a database of trench collapse deaths between 2013 and 2023 and found in instances where workers perished in trench collapses, about 5% of employers were criminally charged. And they often got off with little punishment. Phillip Numrich, owner of Alki Construction LLC, a plumbing and sewer repair business in the Seattle area, was charged with second-degree manslaughter in 2018 in connection with the death two years earlier of employee and longtime friend Harold Felton in Washington state. Felton was working in a 6-to-8-foot-deep trench cutting a new pipe that had been put into place at a West Seattle home when the cave-in occurred, burying him under more than 6 feet of mud, prosecutors wrote in a legal brief filed as part of Numrich’s sentencing. Felton, 36, died of compression asphyxia, which means that something forceful pressed against his chest or abdomen area. The trench lacked the required shoring, prosecutors wrote. During a hearing with state labor investigators, Numrich acknowledged that he was required to have the proper shoring but did not, according to the legal brief. The state cited and fined him $51,500, but cut it in half. Then, prosecutors stepped in. It was the first time in Washington state that an individual employer had been charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of an employee, said Patrick Hinds, a deputy prosecutor with the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office. “This particular case was an important marker in the criminal justice response to worker safety,” he said. Prosecutors reduced Numrich’s charges to attempted reckless endangerment. He pleaded guilty and received 45 days in jail and a $25,000 fine, court records showed. Neither Numrich nor his attorney in the matter, Cooper Offenbecher, returned several calls seeking comment. Rosario Martinez-Lopez thought that he would install drywall or do carpentry work when he arrived at the residential construction site that June morning in 2018 in Granby, Colo. That’s what Bryan D. Johnson, owner of ContractOne Inc., hired him to do. Instead, Martinez-Lopez ended up with a shovel in a 7-to-8-foot trench, installing a main water line, according to the arrest affidavit. Johnson had earlier used a mini-excavator to remove dirt. Suddenly, the trench collapsed, crushing the 50-year-old Martinez-Lopez. His son, Moises Martinez, was also at the job site and helped rescuers retrieve his father’s body. The victim was pronounced dead at a local hospital. “Bryan Johnson conducted all aspects of his construction site without the slightest attention to the safety of employees on the scene,” according to a Grand County, Colo., arrest warrant affidavit obtained by NPR. “He did not … slope the trench walls, did not have a trench box … and did not have appropriate access to ingress/egress.” A subsequent OSHA investigation found that Johnson never trained Martinez-Lopez or other employees about the dangers of trench work. Authorities determined that there was probable cause to arrest him and charge him with criminally negligent homicide. Johnson pleaded guilty to two counts of reckless endangerment and one count of third-degree assault and was sentenced to eight months in jail, court records show. David Michaels, a former OSHA assistant secretary, said the federal agency should turn to criminal prosecutions more for trench deaths, because the fines they levy are often too small to be adequate deterrents, he said. “When a worker is hurt or killed in a trenching collapse, OSHA should very much consider a referral of that event to a local district attorney who could take on the criminal case,” said Michaels, a professor at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health. “If employers see that an employer is sent to jail because a worker is sent to a trench, that will have a much bigger impact on them than fear of an OSHA fine.” Michaels said the responsibility for raising fines and possible criminal penalties is up to Congress, but that there is more OSHA could be doing on its own. “I think the default for trenching regulation violations should be a willful violation with a much higher fine, unless it’s really clear that the employer really had no idea that they could be endangering their workers,” he said. He said that a willful violation determination is up to the OSHA area offices that investigate trench deaths. An NPR analysis found that while most violations after a trench fatality were labeled “serious,” fewer than 10% were considered “willful.” Texas deaths Trench work can be so precarious that OSHA also requires companies to have an experienced supervisor on-site with authority to stop work in a trench if they consider it unsafe, said Vazquez, the health and safety organizer in Austin, Texas, who has trained workers in OSHA safety courses. It was that kind of danger that concerned Jack Martin. Martin was installing a 6-inch sewer line behind a shopping center in November 2019 in Houston, a job he had done dozens — if not hundreds — of times during his more than two decades as a plumber. Suddenly, the interior wall of the trench collapsed, trapping the 41-year-old father, who left behind an 18-year-old daughter. Martin’s dad, Larry, said his son had expressed concern about his safety and had repeatedly asked his employer, Best Plumbing LLC, to get trench boxes for the workers. “He told me, he says, ‘Dad, you know, I’ve already asked them a couple of times and they told me no, they’re too expensive,’” Larry Martin recalled his son telling him. After Martin’s death, OSHA cited Best Plumbing LLC for not having a protective system, such as a trench box, and ladders or other means for workers to exit the trench. The federal agency fined the company $18,892, but later reduced it to $11,335, records show. Best Plumbing owner Vincent Horvath declined to comment on the incident and why he lacked the required protective system. Jimmy Lee Alvarado, 20, dreamed of following his father into the construction industry, just as Jack Martin had followed his father into plumbing. “He was inspired by his dad, and what he did,” Jimmy’s mother, Maria Bocanegra, said. “And he was like, ‘I wanna be like Dad one day and do everything that he does and have what he has.’” So, it was no surprise that the two ended up working at the same site in Jarrell, Texas, in June 2022. Alvarado’s father, Juan Bocanegra, worked for WBW Construction LLC. Alvarado and another man, Jose Vargas Ramirez, 39, were temps provided by a staffing agency based in Moline, Ill., records showed. Alvarado, a father of two, and Ramirez were connecting sewer lines in a 23-foot-deep trench when part of it collapsed, crushing them beneath rocks and mud, according to OSHA records. An OSHA investigation alleges that WBW Construction failed to provide trench protection and exit ladders at regular intervals, two of the same failures the federal agency identified in Jack Martin’s death in Houston in 2019. Alvarado and Ramirez allegedly were more than 130 feet away — instead of 25 feet required by OSHA for trenches 4 feet or deeper — from the nearest point in the trench where they could exit. Also, OSHA claims that the trench collapse was caused when the foreman began to cut across the trench to build a smaller trench, referred to as a “side cut.” The federal agency’s investigation alleged that there were three appropriate trench boxes on-site that could have protected the two men, but were not used. Alvarado’s dad was the foreman. “[Juan] had him go down there because it was his job and he had to get it done,” Maria Bocanegra said. Juan Bocanegra declined to comment. Because OSHA alleges that two of the violations were considered “willful,” if the agency proves that, it could refer the company for potential prosecution once the case is closed. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas said that OSHA has not referred the case to them. OSHA has fined WBW Construction LLC $250,272. The company is contesting the alleged violations and the penalties. “WBW Construction LLC willfully sent these workers into an unprotected trench and ignored federal safety requirements,” OSHA Area Director Casey Perkins said in a December 2022 news release. “Now, two workers’ families, friends and co-workers are left to grieve their tragic, and avoidable, deaths.” Maria Bocanegra said she first learned of the collapse from her 18-year-old son, Kevin, who was also working at the site that day. “He was the one that called me and told me that — he was crying and I couldn’t understand him — but he told me that Jimmy had gotten trapped under and that they couldn’t get him out,” she said. WBW’s management had her husband, the site foreman, sign a statement in English, though he could not read or speak it well, Maria Bocanegra said. She read it weeks later and questioned who penned it. NPR and Texas Public Radio have not been able to independently verify the statement. “I … realized that it wasn’t him that actually wrote out or said what was said,” she said. “It was more them putting to him what to say.” Bocanegra said she found multiple errors, including her son’s last name and their address, and knew that her husband wouldn’t have made such mistakes. Travis Parks, general counsel for the WBW Development Group and its affiliates, including WBW Construction, declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation and the company contesting the penalty imposed by OSHA. Few protections for public employees Three employees of the city of Eutaw, Ala., were working on a broken sewer line in the Branch Heights public housing project shortly before 5 p.m. in April 2023, when part of the trench wall collapsed, trapping 46-year-old worker Tony Rice under mud, asphalt and concrete. “All I could hear was Tony saying, ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe,”’ Garreon Holsey, 22, one of the workers who escaped, told police at the time. No one in the city of 3,000 or rural Greene County was trained in trench rescues, and they didn’t have the necessary equipment like a vacuum truck to suck the water and mud out of the hole, said Christopher Jones, the county’s EMS director. “It was awful,” Jones told NPR in a recent interview. “It happened so fast. There was nothing we could do because it was a dangerous situation.” The closest rescue crews were in Tuscaloosa, about 35 minutes away. When they arrived, they worked frantically to save Rice. After nearly nine hours, rescuers retrieved the lifeless man. “I knew it was going to be a body recovery at that point,” Jones said. Unlike the other trench collapse deaths investigated by OSHA, no state-level or federal OSHA investigators looked into Rice’s death because he worked in one of nearly two dozen states where local and state government employees — about 8 million — are left out of the workplace protections provided to private and federal employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. “There will be no investigation, there will be no penalties, there will be no lessons learned, no follow-up,” said Barab, the former OSHA deputy assistant secretary who served under Obama. “It just kind of gets dropped.” When Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act that created the federal regulatory agency in 1970, it specifically excluded public employees from the newly established protections. The legislation, though, encouraged states to develop their own job and health safety programs, and those states were required to cover their public employees. The act also allowed states to set up “public employee only” state plans where the state would cover public employees and federal OSHA would continue covering the private sector, Barab said. Some states have set up such plans, including Massachusetts, whose public employee health and safety plan covers more than 430,000 public employees. Twenty-three states, including Alabama, Missouri and Texas — and the District of Columbia — have not established protections for their own employees. NPR found at least four instances in the past decade of trench collapses killing public employees in states without OSHA protections. The lack of workplace protections for local and state employees in those states hinders accountability for — and prevention of — worksite danger. “They can’t file an OSHA complaint no matter how unsafe conditions are,\" Barab said. \"There’s no one to complain to.\" OSHA requires daily soil testing when trench work is taking place. Because Alabama is one of the states where public employees are not covered by the federal agency’s workplace protections, no testing was required. “Testing the soil isn’t hard to do, but it takes a little more time … and a lot of trenching is done in an emergency situation where a pipe breaks, so there's not that kind of time,” said Ruth Ruttenberg, a consultant and former OSHA senior economist who authored a 2019 study on trench fatalities. “But if you know that you have a potentially fatal work situation, it's really necessary … to take that into account and do the safe thing for the workers.” Wendell, Idaho, city employee Jerrad Durfee, 43, had expressed concern to his family about working in trenches. He wasn't trained for that kind of work, his mother said. He grew up in the town of 3,000 residents about 25 miles from Twin Falls and also worked as a volunteer firefighter. Idaho is among the states where city and county workers have no OSHA workplace protections. “He didn’t really like being down there, but he was told to do it, so he did it, because he liked his job,” Durfee’s mother, Ynes Durfee, said in an interview with 1A. \"But he was scared.\" Durfee was inside a 6-foot-deep trench in an alley with a jackhammer shortly before noon one September day in 2013. He was breaking up rocks when the walls caved in, burying him in nearly 2 feet of dirt, according to the police report. Levi Diehl, another worker, was nearby and heard the jackhammer stop. He ran to the area where Durfee was and saw the collapsed trench. He scrambled to remove the dirt from Durfee’s head and shoulders. He told authorities that Durfee gasped for air but there was no pulse. Durfee was pronounced dead at the scene. Durfee’s longtime best friend, Brad Murphy, said he is angry that no one was punished for the fatal cave-in. “Wendell’s just going on about its daily life and there’s still no consequences,” Murphy said. “It’s about them being accountable.” This story is a collaboration from NPR's Station Investigations Team, which supports local investigative journalism; Texas Public Radio; and 1A.

Transcript A MARTÍNEZ, HOST: All right, we turn now to a dangerous problem for construction workers, specifically those who work in trenches - these deep ditches you see along the highway at large construction sites and new home builds. Now, without the proper systems in place, those trenches can collapse in an instant, burying the workers alive in a dense slurry of mud and water. Members of NPR's investigations team have found that 250 workers have died from such trench cave-ins over the last decade. Cheryl W. Thompson, an investigative correspondent and senior editor, joins us now. So, Cheryl, tell us about this investigation. What's it about? CHERYL W THOMPSON, BYLINE: So this investigation, we worked together with Texas Public Radio and the program 1A and reviewed hundreds of pages of federal government inspection reports, court records, state safety reports and other documents to determine how many people died in trench collapses, what happened to cause the cave-ins and whether those deaths could have been avoided. MARTÍNEZ: All right. What did you discover? THOMPSON: Well, A, we found that trench collapse deaths are indeed preventable and often occurred when employers violated federal regulations by not having the proper equipment in place, like those metal boxes to keep dirt walls from caving in and suffocating workers. Our investigation also found that companies fined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - we know it, of course, as OSHA - sometimes ignored the penalties and faced no consequences. For example, one business in the Boston area still owes more than $1.4 million from the deaths of two workers eight years ago. And at least 10 companies that employed workers who were killed had been sanctioned before for not protecting employees doing trench work. One business was cited five times in four years, another four times in as many years. MARTÍNEZ: All right. So those are civil penalties, right? I mean, what about criminal charges? THOMPSON: Right. Well, criminal charges are pretty rare. We discovered 11 cases out of more than 200 where authorities criminally charged an employer. And even when someone was charged in connection with a worker's death, those charges were often reduced, meaning that employers usually got off with a fine, probation or a few months in jail. MARTÍNEZ: Now, one of the reporters on this project went to Boston to talk with a witness to one of these horrific incidents in which two men died. Cheryl, tell us about that. THOMPSON: Yes. Ken Bruno (ph) was the witness, and he had not been back to the site since 2016. He's a carpenter who was working inside a townhouse on Boston's South End while the two men were working outside in a trench. They were installing a drain, and Bruno stepped outside for a quick smoke and was standing on the sidewalk next to the trench when it collapsed. KEN BRUNO: I'm looking down, and the guys are down there working. And next thing you know, I seen part of the trench engulf him from the waist down real quick, like, whoosh. THOMPSON: Bruno recalls that a section of pipe attached to a fire hydrant burst, flooding the trench and the street with so much water and mud that it just smothered the two workers. BRUNO: I knew that they were done. THOMPSON: One of those buried alive was a father of six. There's a good chance that both of those workers would be alive today had their employer installed a trench box. It was the third time that that company had been cited by OSHA for unprotected trenches. MARTÍNEZ: So about OSHA - I mean, their job is to make sure workplaces are safe places. So can they come in and close down a business if they're repeatedly violating regulations? THOMPSON: Well, no. Only a court has that authority. What OSHA can do is post imminent danger notices at a job site if it believes the violations pose a threat of serious physical harm or death to workers. But it seldom does that. It's happened only 18 times since 2014. MARTÍNEZ: OK. Now, what about employers? What should they be doing? I mean, the trench boxes, they can be expensive and can take time to set up and install, and, of course, time is money. THOMPSON: Right. Well, Jack Martin was an experienced plumber, putting in sewer lines behind a shopping center in Houston in 2019. He had repeatedly asked his employer, Best Plumbing LLC, to get trench boxes for him and his co-workers. We spoke with his father, Larry Martin, whom Jack called just days before he was killed in a trench collapse. LARRY MARTIN: Two days prior before it happened, he told me. He says, Dad - he said, you know, I've already asked them a couple of times, and they told me no, they're too expensive. THOMPSON: I should mention, A, we reached out to the company's owner, who declined to comment on the incident. We also talked to a woman in Texas named Aubrey Fryday, who lost her son in a trench collapse in 2016. She wondered why OSHA didn't do something about the company where her son Nathan worked. She believed officials there were operating an unsafe workplace. AUBREY FRYDAY: OSHA needs to do more than what they're doing. It shouldn't take a death for them to act. They're just all getting too lazy and sitting behind their desks and doing nothing. THOMPSON: OSHA doesn't necessarily see it that way. We sat down here in Washington with Scott Ketcham, the agency's director of construction. Here's what he said. SCOTT KETCHAM: We're doing everything we can to protect workers every day for America. When we find them, we cite them, and when we cite them, we hold them accountable. THOMPSON: Ketcham acknowledged that more needs to be done, particularly when it comes to holding companies accountable. KETCHAM: And that is a top priority right now. MARTÍNEZ: You know, Cheryl, it's pretty awful to think that this is happening, especially when it's a type of death that seems like it could be avoidable. I mean, it's got to be really, really difficult for the families here. THOMPSON: Oh, it definitely is. Melinda Mattocks-Ushry's brother, Kelvin Mattocks, was one of the two men killed in the Boston trench collapse that I mentioned to you earlier. My colleague, Robert Benincasa, spoke with her at Kelvin's gravesite in rural North Carolina. MELINDA MATTOCKS-USHRY: This is his resting place. This is where he was raised, in the church here. His wife let us bring him home. She knew this is where he would want to be. It hurts so bad. THOMPSON: She thinks about how things could have turned out differently, had her brother's employer, Kevin Otto, protected that trench so that the walls wouldn't have caved in on him and the other worker. MATTOCKS-USHRY: There should have been protection for these guys. There should have been a way out of that hole for these guys. I would love for someone to do something about people that's going to work to do a honest day work - be protected while at work. THOMPSON: And, A, we heard from family members all across the country who agree that more needs to be done. MARTÍNEZ: Cheryl W. Thompson, investigative correspondent and senior editor. Thank you very much for bringing this story. THOMPSON: Thank you, A. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",

    "commentBody": "Trench collapses have killed hundreds of workers in the US over the last decade (npr.org)113 points by rntn 6 hours agohidepastfavorite112 comments Aurornis 5 hours ago> In every instance, the deaths were preventable, experts say. All but one of the victims were male; the youngest was 16. In many cases, the companies failed to follow basic government rules for making trenches safe. Having known someone in the construction industry, I don’t think this is as simple as blaming “the companies”. One of his frequent frustrations is getting workers to actually use the safety gear and follow the company safety policies. This includes properly securing trenches with the equipment they provide and mandate. I’ve heard stories about new guys who refused to wear safety glasses or hearing protection while working machinery. Some of them so defiant that they had to be fired within weeks. Obviously we need to harshly fine the companies that fail to provide safety gear or pressure employees to do unsafe things. However, having had a peek behind the curtain I think this issue is more complex than a simple failure of companies to follow guidelines for providing gear and procedures to employees. You really have to be on top of work crews all the time to make sure they’re actually following procedures rather than cutting corners. reply cjbgkagh 4 hours agoparentIn my experience it's the workers, and it's machoism amongst the workers that creates an intentionally anti-safe culture where such cultures are permitted. Where I live they remove the angle grinder guards off and use 'safety squints' when welding. A friend had people working on his house, when I visited I made them stop their work and put the recently removed angle grinder guards form their new tools back on. I also and got them a chepo welding helmet. Not long after I left that day they took the guards back off and a young worker cut off a 1/4 of his hand and had to be rushed to hospital. My friend had a 'let them do what they want to do' attitude to the workers which thankfully has now been replaced with a 'safety first' attitude. Unfortunately too late for the kids hand. This sort of stuff can't be done bottom up as there is huge social pressure to demonstrate manliness to peers through risky activity. Only strict top-down edicts where such digressions are severely punished can take away that pressure; i.e. instead of using safety equipment it's because they're a sissy it's because their mean old boss is a sissy and they're forcing them to use it. While OSHA can be a bit onerous it really does help to have an organization with teeth pushing safety culture. Instead of the conflict between the workers and their bosses 'stupid rules' it's the 'stupid rules' of some 3rd party. reply SubjectToChange 33 minutes agorootparentWhile OSHA can be a bit onerous it really does help to have an organization with teeth pushing safety culture. Instead of the conflict between the workers and their bosses 'stupid rules' it's the 'stupid rules' of some 3rd party. OSHA standards are quite a low bar in general. An organization that is simply \"OSHA compliant\" is definitely not taking safety seriously. Moreover, OSHA is often far down the list of regulatory agencies that companies are worried about. For example, killing a protected bird species is far more likely to incur 6-7 figure fines and/or land management in prison than a workplace fatality. That said, the situation with OSHA isn't particularly concerning. Most major companies are aggressively safety oriented. Even ignoring the legal liabilities of injured workers the fact is that, in the long term, unsafe working conditions are often less productive and potentially extremely damaging to capital investments. To illustrate, an accident at an oil refinery could easily run into the hundreds of millions in damage, in addition to an equal if not greater amount in lost production. The costs of settling lawsuits and/or fines for safety violations are trivial by comparison. Nowadays, the greatest risks to U.S. labor is not from the likes of Kiewit, Union Pacific, Rio Tinto, etc. It is the small and under capitalized businesses. So, what can be done? Such businesses are already walking on a financial tightrope. If OSHA were to properly scrutinize such businesses even their limited fines would present a significant stress. Some people might retort that if a business can't operate safely than it shouldn't be operating at all, which is a fine. The downside is that all of those services will become substantially less competitive and more expensive. reply crhulls 4 hours agorootparentprevI second this. My day job is tech but I redid a rental property. I told the workers to wear a harness on the roof. I didn’t cheap out and bought nice comfortable equipment. They told me they were wearing it, but I came by unannounced and there they were on the roof with no harness. I asked the supervisor what was up and they were doing the same thing to him. They would put it on then take it off as soon as no one was looking. It was Latin machismo - the social pressure was so strong to not look goofy in a harness. The second time I saw this happen I wrote a firm zero tolerance letter which I translated to Spanish and hand delivered. One of the crew still didn’t listen. I fired him. (Not saying that reckless bosses aren’t an issue, especially in these trenching incidents where the safety equipment didn’t exist) reply s1artibartfast 3 hours agorootparentI'm curious how liability works in this situation and when it ends? It sounds like you were operating as a general contractor. Were you paying the roofers salary or did you have a business to business relationship? Relatedly, someone was telling me what workers insurance is 1% of construction costs for large infrastructure like building hospitals. reply crhulls 2 hours agorootparentI’m technically an owner builder. I have a workman’s comp policy that ranges from 10-40% of payroll depending on the task. For a residential project I can definitively say insurance is way more than 1% of total cost. Eg for the sake of round numbers, let’s say labor is 50% of the total. If I take the absolute lowest percent of what I pay for insurance, we already are up to 5%. This is separate from liability insurance for say negligence if I got sued. I hope my umbrella policy would cover me here but I found in my situation it is a bit confusing.

You took steps to address the issue. Fired people who didn’t listen. The fact they thought they could do it without consequences means they never got into trouble by management at other job sites. If your industry has a culture of not following safety procedures it’s only because bosses don’t enforce it. reply crhulls 2 hours agorootparentSure, in theory you are correct, but it misses the nuances of human reality. Flipping back to my day job, a counter example is security people covering any edge case so that everything grinds to a halt or lawyers over processing everything and stifling creativity. The same people that might grumble about something being a management issue sometimes also complain about bureaucracy and process when things go the other way. There aren’t simple trade off free answers to this stuff. reply newaccount74 35 minutes agorootparentTelling people to wear a harness is not \"covering every edge case so that everything grinds to a halt\". It's just ensuring that the bare minimum is being done to prevent workplace deaths. reply istjohn 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, a top-down safety culture entails some level of bureaucracy and process overhead. That is the price that must be paid for jobsite safety. No one is saying there's a free lunch. reply solveit 29 minutes agorootparentIf safety is cheap but overcoming culture is expensive, at some point it becomes misleading (wrt ethics of participants, not correct course of action) to say the problem is that management doesn't care enough to spend money on safety, even if management is the only lever we have to fix the issue. reply s1artibartfast 3 hours agorootparentprevThat depends on what level of the RCA you are looking at it.

It was my own crew, not a 3rd party company. reply delichon 3 hours agorootparentprevI don't think the angle grinder guard issue is cut and dry. I sometimes operate mine without a guard in conditions where the guard prevents me from seeing the point of contact, which for me is a more severe safety problem. When I can't simply rearrange the work I remove the guard and take extra care. Such complex work environments should not be regulated inflexibly. reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentThey never put the guard back on, you’ll never see a guard in use here. That’s why they consider it ridiculous to use one because no one else does. Never-mind the constant stream of people going to the hospital. Plus they use oversized grinders where smaller ones would be fine and safer even if slightly slower. And they take the guard off from the start so there is no guard while they’re still leaning. I had a ‘see me’ for an exemption policy while I was there and they didn’t need one. They really were not doing the kind of work that needed it. reply giantg2 3 hours agorootparentprevSeems like a decent use case for an endoscope.

(d) is trivially preventable by using fitting safety glasses. (a) and (b) result in cuts that are potentially bad, but not permanent. for me the real issue here is using grinder that are in excess of 5\". sometimes thats necessary, but the idea of throwing around an 8\" cutting disk with a > 1hp motor without a guard just makes me frightened thinking of it. i had a job where they insisted i use one and i just walked off. and cutting tools with blades, i.e for masonry. thats asking for real hurt. or those insane little chiansaws. just no. reply istjohn 1 hour agorootparentMost PPE has very real tradeoffs. Respirators are uncomfortable, especially in hot weather. Safety glasses get dusty and smudged. Gloves limit dexterity. Mortar mixer grates make it difficult to clean unmixed sand and mortar from the sides. Safety harnesses take time to donn and doff and limit mobility. It's rare that the safest procedure is the quickest and cheapest. As a society, we've decided that we are willing to pay the price to keep our workers safe on the job. But it only works if our regulators are effective and make the costs of noncompliance greater than the costs of compliance. reply chgs 1 hour agorootparentSafety equipment can introduce new dangers too, both from correct use, and from refusal to use it For example a hard hat might be fine, people generally are happy with that - they see the benefit, they see things falling, job done. but then you add a ton more stuff which has decreasing benefit and increasing cost to use (in terms of comfort as well as time and dollars) and eventually the worker says “fuck it” and doesn’t even wear the hat. there is always a balance to be had. We do the same in domestic life - we make motor cyclists wear helmets, but not car passengers. If we made all car occupants wear a helmet we would reduce head injuries for occupants in car crashes. But that would be ridiculous. reply christkv 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is not only a us problem for sure.

Project managers and engineers give instructions but workers can and do ignore them and do whatever they want. reply dahart 3 hours agorootparentIt seems like you didn’t understand the distinction between PPE and the project plan for trench boxes. In the case of PPE, the company is providing the safety equipment and asking workers to use it. Yes it’s true that some workers choose not to use ear plugs, glasses, harnesses, etc. (often because the PPE is uncomfortable.) In the case of trench boxes, companies have to keep the information away from workers in order to prevent their use, and the article cites multiple examples of that occurring. Trench boxes require company action and expenditure in advance of construction that is not up to individual workers. When the contractor rents or orders a trench box, delivers it to the site, arranges for the excavator, or even a crane for larger operations, and lays out the construction plan, there is no such thing as ignoring it. Just in case you missed it in the article, not only are trench boxes required by law in the US, a safety supervisor on site overseeing the operation is also required. The laws were written to prevent individual workers from being able to ignore the construction safety plan, and require company oversight. The only way it gets ignored is from the top. reply newsclues 2 hours agorootparentAnd yet the evidence of worker deaths due to lack of safety measures seems to imply that I am right. Maybe you haven’t much experience working on job sites. Maybe you’d know about subcontractors who don’t gaf or workers who are told to do something and they don’t listen. Maybe you’re just unaware of the facts of reality? Utopian fantasy is not real life. reply dahart 1 hour agorootparentYou are right about what? And why? The article clearly explained the worker deaths, and it was because company CEOs had chosen to avoid the mandated safety precautions (trench boxes) over cost concerns, and had chosen to not tell the workers about the safety requirements. They admitted it in many cases, and in some cases went to jail. The authors’ survey of trench fatalities found that company execs overwhelmingly had never planned to install trench boxes in the first place. There were no cases mentioned of trench boxes and heavy equipment being arranged and delivered, and of having individual workers instead decide not to install them. Are you aware of any, and are you accusing the article of some kind of bias? I already agreed with you and I’m aware that workers can make bad individual decisions, but that is not relevant here. We’re not talking about any and all construction safety, we’re talking about trenches and trench boxes. A few simple facts of reality that you might be ignoring that I’ve already mentioned are: 1- trench boxes require heavy equipment and advance planning; 2- the law requires a safety supervisor to ensure workers follow the plan. Neither of those is up to individual workers and cannot be undermined by individual workers. To your broader point (that doesn’t apply to trench boxes), workers only get away with stuff when the company doesn’t care enough. The company is paying, and has all authority to monitor and enforce any and all safety concerns, should they be sufficiently motivated. reply mindslight 52 minutes agorootparentI think one of the examples from the article did say there was a trench box on site sitting next to the trench, but it had not been installed. I would be very interested in the root cause analysis of why that didn't happen. I do agree with you in that I think \"individual workers\" aren't deciding whether to install trench boxes or not - it's definitely a multi person task, and therefore should under the direction of whomever is managing the operation. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the ultimate causes is something like one to several ton mini/small excavators are good at digging 8-10ft deep trenches, but nowhere near big enough to lift the appropriately sized trench boxes. reply snozolli 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe you’d know about subcontractors who don’t gaf or workers who are told to do something and they don’t listen.

I’ve worked in places where the safety procedures were clearly perfunctory (drove a forklift in a warehouse for several years, among other jobs) and if I had insisted on following the actual safety procedures I would’ve gotten endless grief from other employees for slowing them down.

I work in construction and my company has a top-down safety culture which is the only way it really works. Management (including myself) repeatedly tells field workers that their safety is more important than making a bit more money, we have safety training once a month, PPE is readily available, our safety dept visits job sites and helps prepare site safety plans, fall protection equipment is enforced and so on. We also have a ‘stop work’ policy where anyone, even a lowly apprentice, can stop the work in progress if they don’t feel safe. Those of us who sell work are also told not to be afraid to decline work isn’t safe (working on live electrical equipment that could be shut down to work safely, for example). We have a ‘no live work’ policy, but will do live work in certain circumstances where there is no other option (mostly hospitals), and the head of safety and the COO are both involved in pre-task planning and execution to ensure the safest possible methods. We also have some certified rope access techs, those guys take their safety very seriously, to the point where they’re probably safer working off a rope than on a ladder. My workers tell me they feel safer working here when the company explicitly says ‘your life is more important than our profit’ and provides the PPE, tools, and know-how needed to work safely. FWIW, the bigger than construction firm, the more they care about safety. Big contracts can require a TRIR (recordable injury rate) below a certain amount. The big general contractors push new PPE into use, the most recent thing is hard hats with a chin strap to reduce TBI from ladder/lift falls. The strap does a better job of keeping the hard hat protecting the head by keeping it attached.

You can slope the sides of a trench at a ratio of 1.5 ft per 1 ft of depth. Sloping the sides of a trench prevents cave-ins, which is what makes a trench dangerous. It isn’t always possible to slope the sides of a trench, that’s when the trench boxes/shoring come into play. In your case, the trench would be 30’ wide with a gradual slope down to 6’ depth from either side.

    "originBody": "hoakley July 20, 2024 Macs, Technology Managing Classic Mac OS resources in ResEdit The Macintosh was intended to be different in many ways. One of them was its file system, which was designed for each file to consist of two forks, one a regular data fork as in normal file systems, the other a structured database of resources, the resource fork. Resources came to be used to store a lot of standard structured data, such as the specifications for and contents of alerts and dialogs, menus, collections of text strings, keyboard definitions and layouts, icons, windows, fonts, and chunks of code to be used by apps. You could extend the types of resource supported by means of a template, itself stored as a resource, so developers could define new resource types appropriate to their own apps. Apple’s engineers developed a resource editor that quickly became one of the best-known apps on the Mac: ResEdit, last seen in version 2.1.3 way back in 1994. This was the power user’s quintessential tool: if you didn’t like a particular dialog in an app, ResEdit could be used to change it; if you wanted to create your own custom keyboard layout, it was the first choice for that too. If you were wicked enough to want to mess someone’s Mac up, you could go into their system files and change things around when they were out at lunch. Not that anyone ever did that, of course. Each resource type had a four-character name, such as ALRT for an alert definition, CODE for executable code, DLOG for dialogs, KCHR for keyboard layouts, MENU for menus, STR for text strings, and so on. You could have many different KCHR resources, each numbered, so that changing your keyboard layout was a matter of switching from KCHR number 2, the standard British layout, to number 26 for Dutch, for example. Adding your own custom keyboard layout was then merely a matter of defining a new KCHR resource with a unique ID number, here 128, and editing it to map the keys how you wanted. Many resource types had custom editors: that for KCHR has a simple keyboard layout and tabular form. The highlighted (black) keys indicate that the Euro character € being shown would be generated by holding the Opt (Alt) modifier key and pressing the 2 key on the top row of the main keyboard, but not the 2 on the numeric keypad. Customising the icon displayed for QuarkXPress was another fun job for ResEdit. In those days, it was ResEdit that displayed the Get Info dialog for folders and files, where the sizes of resource and data forks were revealed. Note the vital Type and Creator fields shown: those used four characters that determined the icon to be used for documents, and which app would open them when double-clicked. They were used to build the Desktop Databases, mapping files to their icons and apps. Resource forks and the thinking behind them are ingenious and empowering, but open up many security issues. In the days when there was Classic Mac OS malware, it often came in resource forks, and took advantage of their features. Although it was possible to lock and protect individual resources, armed with a copy of ResEdit you could soon change that, and almost anything else that you wished to, just as malware could and did. This is demonstrated in the names seen in this malware library: WDEF preyed on windows resources, MDEF on those for menus, and several of these malicious files are shown with the icon for ResEdit’s resource files. With Mac OS X, resource forks went into hiding, soon becoming extended attributes. App resources were split out into bundles, folders containing standard structures of files and more folders. Within those, the data structures that would have gone into resources are now folders full of files with standard data forks. In many cases, structured data are set out in XML, which is far less efficient than those old resources, and less suitable for power users to tamper with. Instead of the limitless customisations to Mac OS, apps, and almost everything on your Mac, accomplished using ResEdit, apps are now locked down by their signatures, and can’t be tampered with any more. While they lasted, resources and ResEdit were exciting and satisfying, if horribly insecure. References Wikipedia on resource forks. Wikipedia on ResEdit. Apple reference manual for ResEdit 2.1.

I loved ResEdit. I basically lived there. reply userbinator 13 hours agoprevIn the days when there was Classic Mac OS malware, it often came in resource forks, and took advantage of their features. That reminds me of Windows' NTFS \"alternate data streams\", which also got a lot of use by malware in an attempt to disguise its existence, and as a way to bypass access controls on web servers. IMHO these \"hidden features\" are at the wrong level of abstraction and cause a lot of problems, information interchange among others. A file should be a single stream of bytes with a name. If you need another stream of bytes, create another file. If you need to group them together, that's what directories are for. Windows has a resource format too --- it's just part of the program binary. There are likewise resource editors, one of which is also called ResEdit. reply rvense 4 hours agoparentThe implementation proved out to be unfortunate for compatibility reasons, and in hindsight it might be obvious, but the Mac was conceived and implemented when absolutely everything about every platform was proprietary/NIHd: keyboard layouts, connectors, expansion slots, mass storage connectors, operating systems and also file systems. Much of what became PC standards weren't conceived as that, but rather proprietary connectors for a platform that just happened to be easily cloned. There was really no expectation of compatibility between different models of computer from the same manufacturer. I think it does a great disservice to the Macintosh Resource Manager to focus on its implementation using a dual fork file system. What it allowed was a nice high-level interface to work with small pieces of data that hid away a lot of memory and disk management from the programmer - you just ask for a type and ID, and if it's in memory you get it right away, else it gets fetched, including asking the user to swap in the right floppy if they'd swapped it in. Afair it even purges things out of memory when they were no longer needed with no action on the programmers part - this is a big deal in 128k RAM. There were some bad things about the implementation: it's easy to corrupt the resources of a file, for instance, and there's a fairly small limit to the size and number of resources. But having a way to access structured data that's a core part of the platform can be a great thing. If anything, the Mac didn't take this far enough. reply masfuerte 2 hours agorootparentSure, but you can do all of these things with the resources stored in a section of the binary, like Windows does. You don't need a special file system feature. I have never understood the rationale for this design. reply rvense 25 minutes agorootparentBut when you're (basically) one person designing both the filesystem and all the APIs together, and the idea of crossplatform compatibility hasn't really been invented yet, I can see how it looks like something that belongs in the filesystem layer rathr than as a convention above it. I don't know how it works on Windows, but when you say \"section\" of the binary, that implies the files have some sort of structure? Is it part of the PE format or how does it work? With the resource manager, any file can have resources, which means some file formats can be implemented using very simple OS APIs. reply rtpg 6 hours agoparentprev> A file should be a single stream of bytes with a name. If you need another stream of bytes, create another file. If you need to group them together, that's what directories are for. While I understand the appeal of this, the world would have been a lot simpler for a lot of stuff if (for example) every text file had tagged its encoding. I wonder about if we could have moved forward as society a touch faster if Unix wasn't \"all byte streams\", and had a touch of metadata.

The problem of classic macOS was that there was no authorization/protection mechanism at all. Adding an MDEF to an application is just as dangerous as altering a binary under Linux. It is true that the nature of resource forks makes it a bit easier to write a generic hack, but if Linux would allow everyone and every process to edit all files, malware could latch onto some C or X11 library. reply JKCalhoun 7 hours agoparentI wondered a bit about that comment too. It's something of a tangent, but that the OS would load custom WDEFs (window definitions), CDEFs (control definitions), etc., and these had executable code in them, well that was how Mac got viruses. And there was a kind of hierarchy as I recall — where you could install a custom WDEF/CDEF/MDEF at the System level and it would be loaded/executed for all apps. With that line of reasoning though, as you're saying, it was not the resources themselves that were a problem but the way the OS naively loaded and ran them. Sandboxes were for kids.
