Combine the following strategies:Nullify the output of 10 engineers.Change requirements as far into development as possible. To avoid blame, obfuscate requirements from the start.Create 400 hours of busywork.Ask your team to perform tasks that resemble work. Common examples include presentations, diagrams, and ticket management. Create pointless rituals.Create 400 hours of burnout/turnover.Be thankless. Foist blame. Sow confusion. Get angry. Cause others to work overtime.Hold 10 engineers hostage in a technical discussion.Let engineers discuss ideas. Encourage them to pursue elegance over pragmatism. Ensure nobody has the authority to make any decisions.Add 400 hours of communication overhead.Meetings wreck calendars. To inconspicuously waste others\u2019 time, write lengthy messages/documents and share as widely as possible. Welcome all opinions and aim for engagement.Waste 10 weeks of wages on cloud costs.Write slow programs. Avoid DB indexes. Run single-threaded programs on 16-core machines. Opt for exotic hardware with fancy RAM and GPUs. Store data on RAM/disk liberally. Don\u2019t compress anything. Pay no attention to data layouts.Create useless tools.Decide that existing solutions aren\u2019t quite what you need. Write scripts that only one person understands. If the script does something important, avoid documentation.Add 400 hours of compilation/build time.Slow builds waste time and incur compound interest. As build times increase, developers are more likely to distract themselves. To ensure developers are context-switching, recompilation should take at least 20 seconds. You can also write slow tests for similar effect.Write pointless tests.Create dependencies on particular variables without testing the underlying functionality. Mock function calls until no original code runs. Introduce subtle randomness into your tests so that they succeed/fail without cause.Waste 400 hours of engineering on bad architecture.Give zero consideration to how your system design will evolve over time. Alternatively, drive your team obsess over architecture decisions so that they don\u2019t have time to test their hypotheses.Waste 400 hours on deployment.Create as many environments as possible. Production and staging must differ wildly. Launch fragile code with fragile build systems. Migrate your databases frequently.Lose 10 weeks of wages on unhappy customers.Repeatedly fail to detect and address severe bugs. Pay no attention to security vulnerabilities.Write worthless documentation.Explain code in private messages. Write wikis that nobody uses.Trap 10 engineers in a futile skunkworks project.Attract bright engineers and waste their potential. Undersell the difficulty of the project to management; oversell the project\u2019s usefulness. Tell management it\u2019s \u201calmost complete\u201d until they scrap it.Add dependencies that demand 400 hours of maintenance.Engineers individually learn each library.Delay pivoting.Never admit failure. Drown your team in sunk-cost. Ignore 80/20 compromises that could improve your circumstances.Hire 10 0x engineers.Opportunity costs can kill. Dead-weights may not actively harm your team, but they sit in the chairs of people who could actively help.Hire 5 -1x engineeers.Don\u2019t settle for dead-weight. Actively hire engineers who cause catastrophies and resist learning.Prevent 10 -1x engineers from getting fired.Don\u2019t rock boats. Leave no paper trail of failures. Vouch for bad engineering.Incur 400 hours of bug triage.Make undebuggable programs. Plaster layers of abstraction over everything. Write spaghetti code. Make everything sensitive to initial conditions. Avoid pure functions. Use dependencies liberally. Say \u201cit works on my machine\u201d whenever possible.Subscribe to my monthly newsletter.Discuss this page on HackerNews.Schedule a 30-minute chat.Subscribe to my RSS feed.Send me an e-mail.",

Catan has become one of the most popular board games released in the past 30 years, winning the coveted Spiel des Jahres award in 1995 \u2013 the most prestigious award in the tabletop industry - with the series enduring to this day thanks to over 50 expansions, spin-offs and revised versions of the title being published since its launch.In Catan, three to four players attempt to establish and develop their own civilisations on a fictional island. Depending on where players choose to place their settlements, they\u2019ll receive certain resources whenever a particular number is rolled at the start of every player\u2019s turn. Using these resources, players can construct additional settlements, as well as new roads. Players can also upgrade their existing settlements into cities to acquire victory points.Watch on YouTube  Lolies teaches you how to play Catan.Should players ever struggle to obtain particular types of resources, they can try to trade with their fellow players \u2013 as long as they can agree on a deal \u2013 or with one of the various ports on the board. Victory points can also be obtained by building the longest road or buying development cards.Teuber\u2019s family has respectfully requested privacy in order to grieve his passing and \u201cappreciates the outpouring of support and condolences during this difficulty time.\u201d Catan Studios encourages players to \u201chonour Klaus\u2019 memory by being kind to one another, pursuing your creative passions fearlessly and enjoying a game with your loved ones.\u201dYou're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!Create accountTagged WithBoard GameCatanSubscribe to the Dicebreaker Daily newsletterThe latest tabletop gaming news, direct to your inbox.

Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and \u2018supercentenarian\u2019 status. In the United States supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. In the UK, Italy, Japan, and France remarkable longevity is instead predicted by regional poverty, old-age poverty, material deprivation, low incomes, high crime rates, a remote region of birth, worse health, and fewer 90+ year old people. In addition, supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on the first of the month and days divisible by five: patterns indicative of widespread fraud and error. As such, relative poverty and missing vital documents constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status, and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.FootnotesRevised to capture over 80% of people exceeding age 110 in the world, analyze over 50,000 centenarians, and provide predictive models of the density of remarkable age records.

    "hn_content": "Records of supercentenarians exhibit signs of errors and pension fraud, with birthdates associated with the 1st of the month and those divisible by 5; however, some users speculate that such irregularities may result from poor record keeping or lack of access to birth certificates in poorer rural areas of the world. Anecdotes reveal instances of \"real\" and \"official\" birthdates, promotions beyond age cohorts, and variances in education levels in the past. Finally, some comments suggest that graduate school success may depend less on being a course master and more on hours conducting research in the lab.A discussion on the reliability of birth records and how this affects the accuracy of the age of people born in the early 20th century. Many factors, such as poor record-keeping, human bias, rural poverty, and changing calendar systems, can lead to inaccuracies in birth records. Some comments question the relevance of a recent paper that explores the distribution of remarkable age records, while others suggest studying deceased records and other age groups for a more accurate assessment. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity and challenges of accurately documenting and verifying birth records.Experts have doubts about Jeanne Calment's claim of being the oldest person ever, with some suggesting that her daughter may have impersonated her. While some point to a gap in age between Calment and the next oldest person as evidence, others argue that the swap theory does not make sense as it would have required an incredible effort. Reports suggest that birth registrations in poor European countries were often delayed and inaccuracies were common due to poor infrastructure. There were other\u00a0traditions in some parts of Europe, such as assigning a newborn's birthday as that of a child previously deceased, which might help explain some of these cases.An HN user points out that the allegations of Calment impersonating her daughter are unlikely and have been investigated, with no evidence found. There were records of her funeral, death certificate, and relevant records from her daughter's life. The text exchanges featured discussions about deceiving the tax authorities and the chaos of the WWII era. Outliers often happen in data, and Calment's case was also an outlier, but that does not imply proof. Small towns have a more closed circle form of gossip. An HN user points out the limited applicability of the \"list of oldest dogs\" to humans given the scarcity of accurate records for dogs.The possibility of fraud in the record-keeping of the oldest living dogs has been mentioned, though this could also be attributed to data sparsity or feral origin of some dogs. The claim that the oldest human, Jeanne Calment, was not as old as her records show is called into question, but the suggested proof does not seem conclusive enough. The burning of personal photos is viewed as an understandable event rather than a damning one. Some comments note that the requirements for proper record-keeping of dogs might be easier than those for humans, though standards vary from country to country.Controversy surrounds the age of Jeanne Calment, the oldest person ever recorded. Some believe that her daughter faked her death and assumed Calment\u2019s identity, based on a large gap between Calment and the second oldest person ever recorded. Some HN users suggest that her financial situation could be a reason for identity fraud, specifically avoiding inheritance taxes or the distribution of a will. The evidence is still being debated, but HN readers are intrigued by the possibility of upheaval in the record books. The claims of such a supercentenarian being far younger than thought could be an extraordinary discovery.The discussion surrounds the age of the oldest person ever recorded, with some users pointing out that the age gap between her and the next oldest person is significant evidence. However, others argue that the difference in age is not inconceivable, and that there are many people who have lived over 115. Users also note examples of gaps in records in other fields, such as Usain Bolt's record in the 100m dash and Bob Beamon's long jump record. One user brings up the possibility of a mother-daughter identity swap, but the notion is dismissed by many others.Experts are analyzing the controversial case of the oldest person ever, Jeanne Calment, and determining whether a conspiracy led to her daughter assuming her identity to claim inheritance or if discrepancies in the age verification process caused confusion. The controversy has sparked debate on how to accurately verify a person's age, and how different statistical methods apply to continuous versus rank data. The possibility of missing, misreported, or falsified records highlights the difficulties in tracking people's life events, especially in countries without paper birth records. The article concludes that despite different pieces of evidence, there is no conclusive answer to the question of whether Jeanne Calment was truly the oldest person ever recorded.The Blue Zones project only labeled places with good data as Blue Zones, leading to some places being rejected due to untrustworthy data, such as the UK and France. An HN user suggests that Benford's Law (leading digit phenomenon) can be used as a leading indicator of fraud; when humans enter data, they tend to fake numbers with a uniform distribution. Supercentenarians are people over 110, with centenarians being over 100, and a lack of people aged 90-99 in the Blue Zones is curious, and some geopolitical and economic shocks that disproportionately impact people in the age cohort may be a factor. While there are ways to measure a deceased person's age with enough effort, environmental factors can skew the accuracy of these methods in the case of the oldest people on record.Researchers suspect that the world's oldest human, who lived to 122, might have faked her identity as part of a tax evasion scam. However, missing or uniform birth dates do not necessarily indicate malice, and could be a result of inaccurate record-keeping in parts of the world a century ago. While it might be possible to predict the age of older people using AI, identifying age markers in living humans could prove difficult. A healthy diet makes us \"miserable\" old age less so, and while there is disagreement over what constitutes a healthy diet, the Mediterranean Diet is often cited. \nGovernment officials' sloppy cursive handwriting on old census records and family trees has led to unreliable records, particularly in poorer areas. Older countries tend to have better records, and it is suggested that society may require physical in-person proof due to difficulties in distinguishing between real and fake. Despite fewer smokers, life expectancy is declining for Americans. Tontines, which involve screening out potential cheats, will be reintroduced in the US by 2023, with AI potentially being helpful.",
    "hn_summary": "Supercentenarian records raise questions of errors and pension fraud, as birthdates associated with certain patterns are noted, with experts questioning the accuracy and reliability of birth records. Jeanne Calment, the oldest person ever recorded, is questioned for identity fraud, with some suggesting her daughter impersonated her, but some users dismiss the notion, and there is no conclusive evidence thus far. Blue Zones only label places with reliable data, leading to some rejections. Environmental factors can skew methods, like age verification, and cursive handwriting on old records can lead to unreliability. Tontines will be reintroduced in the US by 2023, with AI potentially helping."

    "summary": "Finland joins NATO as its 31st member, with a joint statement from Prime Minister Sanna Marin and President Sauli Niinist\u00f6. The move follows a period of uncertainty over the country's alignment with Russia, and came as part of a broader move to embrace closer military cooperation with the West. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions, with some critics of NATO arguing that Finland's integration will only heighten tensions in Europe, while others see it as evidence of the bloc's continued relevance and success. Meanwhile, concerns have been raised regarding the increased spending requirements that come with NATO membership, and the implications this could have for Finland's economy.",

    "hn_content": "Finland has become the 31st member of NATO, and some Hacker News users are debating the expansion. NATO membership will neutralize Russia's ability to control its neighbors through aggression or threat, suggests one user. Another user defends NATO's decision to allow former Soviet bloc countries like Poland to join, citing the horrors of Soviet Union's actions in Estonia and Ukraine. A Finnish user points out the historical context of defending his country's independence and fears of facing a situation similar to that of Ukraine.An HN discussion focuses on the power structure behind the Soviet Union's violent history. Some argue that assigning blame to a successor state is not the right approach, and instead prefer to see it as delayed violence due to the Soviet Union's breakup. Others point out that the Soviet Union was largely ruled by Russians, although there were important non-Russian Communist Party members. Discussion also touches on Stalin's Georgian origin and the fact that he orchestrated much of the Soviet Union's violent history from his dacha in Kuntsevo. Finally, some HN users note that Russia has historically tried to control neighboring territories and disputes claims that it is a voluntary alliance.Finland has reached an agreement with NATO to enhance their relationship by joining NATO's Partnership for Peace program, which is a potential precursor to full NATO membership. Experts in the field believe this move will give Finland greater security, as NATO provides a guarantee of collective defense. The decision has been widely supported by the Finnish public, with over 80% in favor of joining NATO. Some users on the forum express concerns about the possibility of Finland becoming a foothold for future conflicts, though overall, the move is seen as positive for Finland and the region as a whole.Finland's decision to join NATO, which was widely supported by the population, has been viewed positively as a safe and rational choice in response to Russia's hostile attitude towards the country. Despite the loss of the recent Finnish election by the pro-NATO party, this decision has remained popular. Meanwhile, Sweden's stance on remaining neutral is questioned, with opinions changing after the Ukraine invasion. NATO is seen as much more than just the might of the US, with several powerful militaries and countries with significant navies and nuclear power within its alliance.US involvement in NATO is viewed negatively, but NATO forces outside of France, the UK, and Poland would struggle against Russian resistance. Some argue that NATO's recommended 2% of GDP expenditure is effective, while others worry about lacking nuclear capability. The collective strength of NATO is important, with the US' military might comprising 75% of NATO's power. However, Turkey blocking Sweden's NATO application is problematic, and there are concerns about Russian military activity and war crimes in Ukraine. Comments on this topic are flagged due to politics and posturing.Comments on a post on Hacker News suggest that there have been erroneous opinions reflecting Russian propaganda on the platform, particularly with the ongoing Ukraine conflict. There are arguments for and against the expansion of NATO, with some comments implying support for the West and its values. Sarcasm and political beliefs are present within the comments, but they are not the central argument or factual.",

    "hn_content": "The 'Tell HN' post shows that the ratio of job seekers to job hires is at a record high of 0.94, with a chart going back to 2014 for further context. The current high ratio is partly due to the growing number of people seeking remote jobs, and the reduced employee turnover for remote employers. Remote roles are significantly represented on HN, and so there is an over-representation of candidates chasing those roles. However, it is worth noting that the medium/long term outlook is still positive, as there is expected to be an increase in company IPOs, which typically leads to more hiring.Despite the data indicating more companies are hiring than people looking for jobs, some job seekers are experiencing difficulty finding employment due to the high years of experience required for junior positions. Some HN users speculate that many job postings requesting experience levels do not require the advertised qualifications. The psychological barrier of posting on WWTBH means that more people may be looking at the Who's Hiring thread than posting their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, while some users report positive experiences with WWTBH and receiving offers from quality companies. The reluctance to seem disloyal to current employers by openly searching for new jobs may be a factor contributing to the current slowdown in tech hiring.Despite high unemployment rates in other industries, there is an ongoing headcount of job postings in the tech industry, causing a constant dampener on the velocity. The tech industry was considered the worst job market, except for those who could work from home. Many businesses outside the tech sector were actively hiring due to a demographic shift with many Boomers retiring (or dying) and that gap has not been filled. Some companies may be posting jobs without actually hiring, and programming languages in demand continue to change. Despite low unemployment rates, labor shortages and issues with pay are still present.Tech job interviews are becoming more challenging and invasive, including recording and prohibiting the use of alt-tab, increased emphasis on one's command of English, and home assignments with strict requirements. The interview process in the tech industry is vastly different from other professions, with hiring often based on candidate endurance rather than qualifications. Poorly performing companies are having a hard time retaining or hiring anyone; even trendy companies like Bird are not immune to stock devaluation. Many companies are now imposing a six-day workweek, mirroring an unpleasant dystopian future.A Hacker News user shares their experience of taking an IQ and personality test before a job interview; they question the purpose of such a test, especially with the added pressure of limited time. They then discuss the option of consulting and software factory work, which they describe as low quality, outdated tech, and low pay, with little interest in quality work but selling billable hours. Despite multiple positions being advertised on Hacker News, an HN user points out that the hiring ratio is lower than 0.94, though they acknowledge that, like looking at two currencies' exchange rate, the trend is more important than the exact ratio.  Many people responded positively to a Who's Hiring thread, with some users describing getting their current job as a result.The Tech Times reported on a recent HN thread tracking the number of \"Who is hiring?\" and \"Who wants to be hired?\" posts. Despite seasonal fluctuations, the data shows that the ratio of \"Who wants to be hired?\" to \"Who is hiring?\" has been on an uptrend over the past few years. This is concerning, though the reasons why are open to interpretation. Some users speculate that companies are posting fake job ads to bolster their image or collect resumes. Others suggest that the ratio reflects increased competition in the tech industry, making it harder for job seekers to find work.Despite some experiencing a decrease in recruiter contact, an HN user suggests that there are still more job opportunities available for those job seeking, and perhaps viewable on corporate job boards. However, for those still employed, actions such as RTO implementation may motivate changing of roles. Several users state that the job standard has lowered, seeing decreased pay and job offers. A trend noticed in multiple analyses speaks to April being a slow period for available jobs. Regardless, with AI predicted to automate the tedious parts of job functions, some workers are inspired by the impending revolution.",

The main idea is that developers have access to AI agents that can use tools. The developer writes a short documentation or a technical spec in plain English and then lets the AI agent do the actual work. The AI agents have access to tools like writing to a file, running code, running commands, installing dependencies, deploying, etc. Agents operate in a secure sandboxed cloud environment that's powered by Firecracker. This way, you for example describe what a server route should do and the agent codes it for you.

    "hn_content": "An open-source IDE powered by AI is being built, which is receiving significant attention on Hacker News. While some developers find using AI prompts easier than an actual programming language, others have trust issues with natural language programming and prefer to write code themselves. The AI-powered tool can be especially helpful for developers who are not proficient with certain frameworks or tools, and it can help with generating boilerplate code and navigating code more efficiently. While the current state of AI-powered programming may be useful in certain areas, future tools could prompt users to provide more details and become much more advanced and useful for developers.An AI editor is being developed that allows users to write technical specifications and then collaborate with an AI agent. The editor isn't used to write code. Instead, automated programming software interprets the technical specifications and writes the code for the user. However, some users have found that the AI guesses wrong, which can be frustrating. The aim is to focus on \"the essential complexity of software,\" understanding the problem, and describing it. Over time, people will discover basic phrases and keywords and find out what sentence structures work best for getting a desired outcome.A project called e2b, created by experienced devtools builders, is using AI to directly program code in a \"natural-language\" approach, but with many questions as to the AI's usefulness, and uncertainty regarding data privacy and transparency. While VS Code is favored over an AI-focused programming tool, e2b is aiming to stand out with its built-in GPT-4 API support, though the repo is still in progress. Additionally, there are significant concerns over its determined lack of deterministic, reproducible\u00a0code generation, and uncertainty about how best to maintain the link between natural language programming and the resulting source code.ChatGPT, a language model-focused AI, has sparked discussion on licensing issues and intellectual property ownership. Some users think that while the model essentially creates software outputs, it may in fact belong to the public domain as edits are not made to the created code. Some users have noted the rise of custom AI IDEs and the potential future uses for these \"fuzzy interpreters.\" As for ChatGPT specifically, a case study was presented showing that it was used for a non-trivial programming job, which some users found impressive. However, some remain skeptical of the usefulness of AI coding to replace human programmers.A new development in AI language models (LLMs) is being discussed on Hacker News. The model shows potential in generating code automatically and offers the ability to integrate with OpenAI, albeit with some shortcoming that needs addressing. The AI agents designed in this program work in a self-repairing loop and may be used as a tool for developers to provide inputs to the codes generated by the AI. However, a few experienced users' opinions indicate that there is still a gap in the model's functionality, requiring advancements in the contextual window and semantic layout for it to improve.E2b, a new AI tool, allows developers to input a technical specification, and it codes and builds the app. The program uses the GPT-3 algorithm and requires an API key from OpenAI. While E2b is a promising concept, some worry about issues surrounding trust and maintenance of AI-generated code. However, others suggest that reviewing the source code may be faster than writing it from scratch. Some individuals have requested integration with VS Code.The post discusses e2b, an AI-based tool that builds software using a technical spec provided by the user. It is not a code generator or like Copilot, as the tool collaborates with an AI agent, providing a virtual developer. The discussion also raises potential uses, including writing documentation, tests, and examples, generating projects longer than the context length of the LLM or writing an analysis plan, among others. The underlying model for e2b is based on GPT. There are discussions on the licensing status of e2b and potential alternatives, as well as skepticism about OpenAI's data policies.",

Some HN users suggest that the original limit was likely due to performance issues, and that the decision to remove it may be a result of infrastructure upgrades. The reversal is significant because it removes a significant limitation on the use of Google Drive by professionals who produce a significant number of files. While Google has not explained the reason for the reversal, users are delighted with the change.",

    "hn_content": "Google reversed their decision to impose a 5 million file limit in Google Drive, a move that caused outrage among users. Google initially minimized the impact of the decision, referring to it as affecting only a small number of users, however, some HN users argued that such phrasing aims to downplay the effects of the decision. There was a debate among users about how to present numbers, with some arguing that percentages can be misleading when dealing with large scale companies like Google. One HN user argued that corporations tend to prioritize legal risk over user satisfaction when making decisions.Comments on the recent Google Drive outage suggest that the impact was more severe than initially thought, with some users pointing out that it affected many power users. Meanwhile, some question Google's communication strategy and its lack of understanding of the importance of customer service. Overall, the incident highlights the risks of trusting a single provider for cloud storage, and users should consider diversifying their backup sources.Comments on a Hacker News post discussing Google's recent decision to remove the 2TB storage option from Google Photos reveal a debate about the extent to which businesses and governments should consider the impact of their decisions on a small number of people. While some argue that a company should be able to choose who its services are available to, others suggest that this approach ignores the impact of corporate decisions on real individuals. The comments also highlight the pervasive influence of \"management by metrics\" that prioritizes profits over public interest.Google's product is advertising and they automate customer service to minimize high costs. Google Drive has been criticized for poor management, with Microsoft as competition. The web UI for Google Drive seems exclusively designed for tablet users, which infuriates long-time computer users. Automobile companies wanting in on EVs now face competition from Apple, which intends to take on Tesla with its new Apple Car project. The change in management is a good sign, for years it was just speculation, and this move makes Apple more like Google. CryptPad seems promising as a self-hosted web version of an entire office suite with end-to-end encryption between users.Google Drive will no longer support users with more than 5 million files in a single account, with users receiving an 'exceeded storage quota limit' error when attempting to add files. While some users suggest the policy change was not driven by technical limitations, a Google SRE points out that the 5 million file limit is likely a tradeoff between scaling, architecture redesign and limiting user impact.Google Workspace's recent change to impose a 5 million file limit without communicating it has sparked outrage among users who were directly impacted. One user pointed out that the advertised 5TB pooled storage limit did not mention this limit. Another user noted that the average image size would already hit this limit, let alone smaller documents. While a defense was made for engineers possibly overlooking customer communication on security issues, it was argued that a competent Product Manager would have paused engineering so as to determine actual user impact and line up messaging. There has been no word from Google acknowledging the undocumented limit imposed nor any such rollback.Elon Musk's recent Twitter name change from 'Elon Musk' to '#bitcoin' sparked speculations on the reason behind the change. Some users speculated that it was an April Fools' joke that the company was unable to bring in on time on 1st April. Other users suggested that it was a tactic to manipulate the Dogecoin market. An HN user mentioned the \"Boris Johnson technique\", where undesired articles are buried in Google search results with unrelated comments. A conversation thread on the comparison between the results provided by OpenAI-enabled Bing and Google Bard yielded mixed opinions. Google Bard provided a succinct and useful summary with easy readability while Bing's conversational tone was helpful, albeit with a few issues.Some people argue that space exploration contributes to climate change and is not a human right, while others discuss the integration of ChatGPT with Bing and Google's slower pace. There are differing views on the future of Google's revenue and margin, and the difficulty of getting users to switch from a default search engine. Some are optimistic about AI's potential, while others express concern over AI-generated content's impact on the web. Finally, a comment critiques Google's stability and neurotic culture.",

The creator of the simulator has done extensive work on UI features, especially 'scopes', and while there has been thought of monetizing and extending Circuit.js with more features, it's currently simple, but a distinctive niche simulator.A web application called CircuitJS allows users to simulate and test circuits with ease. Unlike other engineering simulation tools, CircuitJS is accessible to engineers from other fields who wish to add their contributions to hardware development; however, its implementation may not appease everyone, thus creating an issue where tools remain mere \"toys.\" Albeit user-friendly, Python has not been a common choice for collaboration, and there isn't an avalanche of successful open-source projects with both computation and user interface written in Python in any field. Additionally, pre-existing circuit simulators need to improve to link better with real circuits. Despite the limitations of spice models and component selection, innovative simulator projects such as CircuitJS, CircuitLab, and CircuitVerse promote learning and enable engineers to design projects faster with better productivity.A modified version of a 3L-FC converter has been created, utilizing capacitors and an auxiliary switch to achieve a time-invariant current for the converter. This allows for the virtual elimination of filter capacitors at the input and output of the converter, theoretically reducing the need for smoothing capacitors in a computer power supply. The auxiliary switch faced issues with hard-turn-on, which became problematic when converting high voltage down to something a 1.6 MW induction motor inverter could handle. By coupling the inductors across phases, the converter is able to fully charge/discharge output capacitance while minimizing ripple.",

Most agree that writing assembly is tedious, but debugging it is a nightmare without clear traceability. Some users suggest pseudo-C or flowcharting as a way to translate code to assembly, while others remark on the discipline and machine knowledge required to write maintainable assembly code. The article includes useful expanding hyperlinks, and users appreciate the personal touch of the website design.User feedback on a programming guide prompts additions and fixes. Memories of debugging assembly code are shared. Assembly language's shorthand convention is examined, and while some changes could be made, conventions remain due to familiarity and the infrequent users of assembly language. One user proposes a higher arithmetic convention but recognizes issues with scalability. Another suggests just using C instead.The author discusses the differences between RISC assemblies and x86-64, noting that RISC assemblies are more straightforward with explicit memory accesses; however, they do not necessarily outperform CISC ISAs such as x86-64. Some comments highlight that some instruction sets, such as Saturn assembly language, are easier to read and learn than others. There is a discussion on the difficulty of learning assembly language due to its limited abstraction, though experts emphasize that it can lead to efficient programming. The article and comments avoid political or religious statements and remain neutral while discussing technical aspects.Developers discuss the usefulness of terse and cryptic notation in assembly programming, with some arguing that it can actually be more efficient for the brain to process, while others advocate for more readable syntax. Some share personal experiences of writing assembly code and reading disassembly for debugging purposes. One user mentions the popularity of Compiler Explorer for understanding AVX512 code generation. Another user shares their struggle with reverse engineering a large driver. Lastly, a user mentions the enlightening read that can be had from analyzing JVM assembly with a particular flag.Experts discuss the best way to teach and learn assembly, with recommendations for specific architecture and tools. While writing assembly code can be painful, reading it is still important, especially for reverse engineering. One HN user uses Lisp's DISASSEMBLE function to check optimization declarations. AI and machine learning may not necessarily lead to better assembly code. AI and other tools can only work off of publicly available knowledge and cannot know what they don't know. The consensus is that while working off of existing knowledge is important, discovering new knowledge and asking the right questions is essential for growth.Experts discuss whether GPT-4 is truly intelligent or just exhibiting emergent behavior. One user argues that the hype around the program is due to OpenAI's secrecy rather than its actual abilities. Others debate the difference between AI and AGI and what qualifies as intelligence.

Furthermore, an early dynamic spacing compression technology that was nearly double the typical record's running time is presented. As well as this, comments mention various details such as the FM radio's elegant solution and the lower bandwidth of the A-B channel, and further resources that may intrigue those interested in cutting-edge record groove technology.A YouTube channel focuses on delivering technology content at a slow pace; some viewers find it dorky, while others appreciate the more relaxed approach. The physicality and the permanence of vinyl records appeal to some music listeners, especially when compared to more ephemeral mediums like MP3s. Vinyl is said to provide a different, more active and focused listening experience than digitals, which tend to be more algorithmically curated. Record sales have surpassed CD sales as music lovers gravitate towards high-quality sound and tangible connections with artists. The slow pace and sophomoric definition of stereo in a video explanation is received as condescending by some viewers.Vinyl mastering engineer rolls up the bass level on the EQ over the length of the side as the record is cut. Quadraphonic CD-4 records from the 1970s encode 4 discrete channels into a single record groove with two additional channels on a 30kHz carrier signal above human hearing range. The mid-side technique is used elsewhere, besides record grooves, including compressed audio files, signal processing chains in the studio, and certain stereo microphone recording techniques. Stereo vinyl records are recorded with vertical groove profile as V=L+R and horizontal as H=L-R, backward compatible with older mono gramophones that read only L+R and stereo players do H+V=2L and H-V=2R to decode. Magnetic sound recording is just running past a speaker coil at a constant speed while holding something long and ferrous next to it, and to play it back, do the same thing but plug the coil into the input. Dolby Pro Logic II stereo signal can encode a surround sound signal. Mono is better for 12\" dance records due to avoiding stereo image/balance effects in clubs, and avoiding phase effects between speakers in multi-speaker setups.Users on Hacker News discuss the possibility of encoding digital data onto vinyl records. Some commenters suggest it could work, potentially with lossless compression and utilizing ultrasonic frequencies. Others point out that vinyl records with digital processing already exist, while some discuss the history of quadraphonic records. One commenter shares a link to a bootable vinyl record that can run DOS, while another mentions a band that encoded a secret message into a track. Overall, the discussion revolves around the intersection of analog and digital technology.",

There are philosophical debates around what constitutes consciousness and whether AI will cause societal problems or create new opportunities. The potential risks of AI development, job security, and the relationship between efficiency and human welfare are also discussed. AI safety and potential negative externalities, including the impact on public discourse and control over humans, are concerns.While AI's with super intelligence are more powerful than humans, regulation is necessary as they excel in emotional manipulation and lying; experts reflect on the limitations of human knowledge compared to AI's emergent behavior.

Here's his English home page:http://www.isc.meiji.ac.jp/~kokichis/Welcomee.htmlSo we're looking at a photo of an actual 3D object and its mirrored reflection, which should obviously appear incorrect since, well, the reflection is not apparently mirrored but rather facing the same way as the real object. I think the key to understanding what we're seeing is that the non-mirrored image is also not as it appears. We'd need to see it rotated to understand the actual shape.Here's a short YouTube video of his \"Ambiguous Garage Roof\" that I've now watched several times and it keeps blowing my mind:https://youtu.be/KtA6u1HIqbg[1] https://xkcd.com/1053/ reply  omershapira 1 hour ago        | parent | next [\u2013] Funny story: In 1984, my mom, a Computational Geometry researcher, saw a proof [1] in some IEEE journal that she was annoyed with.

Literally, drawing shadows of optical illusions generally makes them stop being optical illusions. Figuratively, all illusory experiences (magic tricks, scams, psychotic delusions) tend to have some mundane inconsistency which is likely to go unnoticed, but if you know to look for it the illusion evaporates. Illusions don't have shadows. reply  hammock 8 hours ago        | prev [\u2013] Is there a place to buy these?

    "hn_content": "A Hacker News post argues that e-bikes should be the focus of our electric vehicle efforts, but some argue that it's about infrastructure, not vehicles. Commenters discuss the need for infrastructure changes to accommodate e-bikes, including painting bike lanes, adding charging stations, and re-engineering cities. Others point out that changing infrastructure is affordable and could ultimately be beneficial for the health of the population and local business. One user suggests focusing on only allowing EVs in city cores, while another argues that the existing car infrastructure was subsidized for fossil fuels, and it's time to make changes.A writer discusses how they were able to use a non-electric bike as their primary mode of transportation, even with a BMI of 46, in their relatively flat hometown of Dresden, Germany. An HN user mentions the percentage of Americans who don't know how to ride a bike as compared to those with a license. Others discuss why adults may not enjoy biking regularly, including issues with safety and weather. Some believe that if infrastructure and accessibility improved, more adults may begin to ride bikes regularly, as seen in New York City.A discussion on the benefits and challenges of cycling infrastructure has taken place on Hacker News. While some argue that focusing on bicycles is an odd choice and ignores the needs of those who cannot ride a bike, others suggest that bikes can help people with health issues and offers an eco-friendly, cheap mode of transportation. An HN user points out that cycling infrastructure can benefit people with disabilities and children. The discussion touches on the potential need for a transition that spans generations, as different types of personal transport converge. There is debate around the idea that bikes are accessible to most of the population, and some believe that cars are still the most practical choice for many Americans.A discussion on Hacker News about investing in biking infrastructure to encourage healthier modes of transportation sparking mixed reactions from readers. While some believe it could lead to improvements in infrastructure and health, others argue that snow and the risk of falling make biking too dangerous, particularly for older people. One commenter claims that the enduring popularity of articles on Hacker News about biking just shows demographic bias towards young, city-dwelling readers. Additionally, another comments that while cars may be great on an individual scale, they are bad on a societal scale, encouraging bad design, wasting space, and causing danger to bicyclists and pedestrians.Comments on a Hacker News post argue that while nobody wants to do away with all motor infrastructure, allocating roads for smaller, slower bicycle and bicycle-like traffic could transform cities for the better. E-bikes specifically are praised for making it easier to commute in any weather, providing cheaper and more efficient transport in cities, and allowing people to shift to a more eco-friendly lifestyle without sacrificing much of their previous conveniences. However, some are still worried about theft in urban environments.Bicycle theft is prevalent due to a lack of enforcement and the low value of bikes. While a secure home contents policy can cover theft outside the home, bike owners should take precautions like the Sheldon brown locking technique, anti-theft bolts and using GPS. Some suggest GPS could help police locate stolen bikes, but enforcement without registration may prove difficult. Others propose secure bike lockers or bigger ones to deter theft. Organized gangs move bikes across borders, increasing police pressure on them along with soft penalties for theft. Lastly, some tech can help resist bike theft, like software-defined bikes.The lack of adequate bike parking infrastructure in several cities has led to a public policy failure that impacts the usability of bikes as an eco-friendly and cost-effective vehicle. Commentators note that while e-bikes are replacing traditional bikes, they aren't yet changing the way people move, given that car traffic volumes have unequivocally risen in the post-pandemic world. One user points out that what we need is e-bike standards for the components, given the current lack of standardization and the exorbitant costs of replacing broken parts. Nonetheless, e-bikes are growing in popularity as they outsell electric cars, motorbikes, vans, busses and trucks combined, with Lemonade offering bike insurance for a low monthly rate of $7.The debate in the comments section focuses on the standardization of components in the bike industry, particularly in regards to motors and batteries. While there are many standardized components, there are also many different standards for each type of component. An open system that allows third-party manufacturers to build motors and batteries to be interchangeable with existing bikes would be ideal. One user shares their personal experience of using an ebike for commuting, expressing that ebikes are a fun, healthy, and fast mode of transportation, particularly for trips under 15km. The main barriers to promoting bike commuting are incompetence and malice, as politicians may not understand the benefits of bike lanes and incumbents in the transport industry may resist change.An HN user believes that policies promoting e-fuel are contradictory, and rather we should focus on sharing the pie fairly. HN users discuss the issue of bike theft and suggest that e-bike bike shares or cheap alternatives could be solutions. Another user suggests geo-trackers in bikes for theft prevention. E-bikes have divided opinions, some see them as unnecessary and unsafe, while others view them as facilitating the adoption of bikes as a mode of transportation. Some users believe \"cars\" cause similar issues to e-bikes in terms of letting inexperienced operators go too fast.Experts on Hacker News discuss the experience of bike riders in North America and provide better solutions for getting respect on the road. Anecdotal evidence suggests that taking the lane as a cyclist helps to reduce close passes from drivers. Many commenters express support for e-bikes, sharing experiences of using them as an alternative to cars for commuting. While e-bikes are seen as useful for replacing some car trips, they are not a complete replacement due to the speed, range, and hauling capabilities of cars. Some discuss the need to reduce the size and weight of cars in order to promote safer and more sustainable transportation.Replacing a car with an e-bike may not be practical for everyone due to lifestyle and weather factors. Congress's decision to limit the tax credit on e-bikes over $4,000 is not entirely accurate as there are still cargo e-bikes available for less than the maximum limit. The use of e-bikes provides some exercise benefits, although not comparable to a strenuous workout. The argument that people can bike in snowy conditions similar to Finland may not be practical for everyone, and Finnish infrastructure is unique to the country. Financial incentives to switch from cars to cargo e-bikes may not be enough for Americans to make the switch. Encouragement for people to use e-bikes for short distances and to provide accessible parking options may help promote e-bike usage.An HN user points out that electric bikes could supplement cars rather than replace them, saving money and the environment. Bike riders forget that not everyone can operate a bike in all weather conditions; we need more micromobility options of all shapes and sizes. Small, enclosed, and electric cars could be a potential solution for people's transportation needs. In cities, bike lanes and scooter racks should be available for public use. Protected bike lanes are vital for biker safety. There is a lot of space for bike lanes in the US, and bike racks are cheaper than car parking spots.Some Hacker News users discuss the challenges of using e-bikes, particularly in harsh weather conditions or areas with high rates of bike theft. Various leading e-bike brands are also critiqued for their custom-made components and maintenance issues, with some users advocating for building one's own e-bike using standardized parts like Bosch and Shimano. Despite potential drawbacks, personal electric vehicles like e-bikes and electric scooters can provide convenient and sustainable transportation options for short trips and commuting.Experts on Hacker News discuss the benefits and drawbacks of e-bikes and e-scooters compared to traditional bikes. While some users argue that e-bikes are expensive and lead to waste, others suggest that they provide easier commutes, especially for those who aren't fit or have longer distances to travel. Critics note that e-bikes can be difficult to control, and some models are prone to accidents or have substandard safety features. Users in Sweden point out that the government offers incentives for those looking to purchase e-bikes, although this program was only available in 2018.E-bikes are more efficient than traditional bikes, filling a critical niche towards minimising dependence on cars, according to a Tech Times journalist. Cargo carrying is generally better with traditional bikes, especially in cities with rolling hills and modern heat islands. A number of HN users voiced their opinions on the feasibility of e-bikes for urban mobility. Overall, one user believed that e-bikes replace a majority of car usages, while another preferred unicycles for their manoeuvrability and lacking the need for parking spaces.",

    "hn_content": "Cheap, tiny smart speakers have played a crucial role in the rise of digital payments in India, making it easier for shopkeepers to accept e-payments. The speakers eliminate the need for shopkeepers to fiddle with their phones to confirm that they have received payment, since the device just reads out the amount, which the customer can verify before leaving. Indians living abroad need to keep an Indian phone number active to use UPI or use India-issued cards, so digital payments can be pretty inconvenient for visitors. Tourists from G20 countries can use UPI at select international airports.Paytm has launched a device in India that aims to help vendors and retailers that may struggle with technology to take payments. The speaker device simply says the amount received out loud, eliminating the need for the vendor to be able to read or write, or check their phone to confirm payment. Commenters suggested that a simple screen display could work just as effectively. Vendors use the device because they do not like having to check their phone every time there is a payment, particularly when busy, and the device is also relatively cheap to operate. Some vendors, however, in India are already accepting payments via smartphones without the need for a speaker device.A street vendor device is gaining popularity in India for its usefulness in making payment transactions. The small device, which resembles a tea kettle, alerts vendors to transactions made using payment apps with a notification chime and can be connected to a speaker for a louder alert. Some users of the device suggest that it is more convenient than using a smartphone, which could be lost, taken, or drained of battery. Meanwhile, debate on literacy rates in India and the U.S. has arisen, with indications that measures of literacy standards may differ significantly between the two nations.India's low literacy rate has led fintech companies to use audio-based payment confirmation systems targeting its niche illiterate population. Illiteracy remains high around the world, including regions such as Africa, where digital payments have already gone big. Funding education remains a challenge as politicians lack motivation to change how schools are funded, resisting empowering local entities to improve education. However, having good educational opportunities does not always translate into better literacy rates, with some people struggling to read and write due to functional difficulties or denial. Commentators suggest not only focusing on society's failures but also considering what can be done by individuals.A soundbox developed by Indian payment app PhonePe is helping small merchants in the country fight fraud and accept digital payments with greater ease. The secure device attaches to the merchant\u2019s smartphone and announces when transactions are made, removing the need for the merchant to read their device\u2019s screen. Over 500,000 Indian merchants now use the technology, which has also been praised for enabling instant, small loans for vendors requiring stock replenishment.The PayTM device in India uses a speaker to confirm digital payments audibly, making it easier for shopkeepers to receive payments and reduce fraud. The device is cheap and efficient, solving one specific problem. It costs less than a USD a month, making it affordable for many shops, and subscription fees help create a new revenue stream. Digital payment transactions in India stand at 8.5B per month, which is impressive. However, claims that globalists want to enslave India are unfounded and irrelevant to the topic at hand.",
    "hn_summary": "Tiny, inexpensive smart speakers have significantly contributed to the adoption of digital payments in India by simplifying payment acceptance for shopkeepers.

They found that the levels of five CFCs rose rapidly in the atmosphere from 2010 to 2020. Their results are published today in Nature Geoscience1.The chemists policing Earth\u2019s atmosphere for rogue pollution\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d says Martin Vollmer, an atmospheric chemist at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology in D\u00fcbendorf who helped to analyse data from an international network of CFC monitors. \u201cWe expect the opposite trend, we expect them to slowly go down.\u201dAt current levels, these CFCs do not pose much threat to the ozone layer\u2019s healing, said Luke Western, a chemist at the University of Bristol, UK, at an online press conference on 30 March. CFCs, once used as refrigerants and aerosols, can persist in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Given that they are potent greenhouse gases, eliminating emissions of these CFCs will also have a positive impact on Earth\u2019s climate. The collective annual warming effect of these five chemicals on the planet is equivalent to the emissions produced by a small country like Switzerland.It\u2019s highly likely that manufacturing plants are accidently releasing three of the chemicals \u2014 CFC-113a, CFC-114a and CFC-115 \u2014 while producing replacements for CFCs. When CFCs were phased out, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were brought in as substitutes. But CFCs can crop up as unintended by-products during HFC manufacture. This accidental production is discouraged by the Montreal Protocol, but not prohibited by it.\u201cA lot of this probably boils down to the factory level,\u201d Vollmer says, pointing out that HFC production is on the rise. \u201cA factory can be run relatively clean or relatively dirty.\u201dEyes on the skiesThe rise in the levels of the two other CFCs is a mystery. \u201cCFC-13 and CFC-112a should not currently be used or produced,\u201d says Rona Thompson, an atmospheric scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Air Research in Kjeller who was not involved in the analysis.The researchers speculate that levels of CFC-112a might be on the rise because of its use as a solvent or as a chemical feedstock. However, they say they need to discuss this idea further with chemical engineers to confirm that assessment.Illegal CFC emissions have stopped since scientists raised alarmBut the appearance of CFC-13 is much more baffling. \u201cWe really have no clue\u201d where the emissions are coming from, Vollmer says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know of any chemical process where this will show up as a by-product.\u201d And, because there aren\u2019t enough monitoring stations around the globe, it is difficult to pinpoint where this and the other CFC emissions are coming from, Thompson says.Nonetheless, Andreas Engel, an atmospheric scientist at Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany, says this research shows that the global monitoring system is largely working. Scientists are keeping a close watch on the planet\u2019s atmosphere and spotting problems. \u201cWe just need to find out where it is coming from and then people will be willing and obliged to fix it,\u201d Engel says.This is what happened a few years ago, when researchers detected high levels of CFC-11 in the atmosphere2, and traced them to eastern China3. They deduced the source on the basis of readings from monitoring stations in South Korea and Japan, reporting it in May 2019, and afterwards, levels began to fall. Scientists got somewhat lucky with CFC-11: monitoring stations equipped to detect that particular chemical happened to be located relatively close to the source.China feels the heat over rogue CFC emissionsEngel says it would help to increase the coverage of CFC-monitoring stations \u2014 for instance, the continents of Africa and South America have little if any coverage.If most emissions of the five recently detected CFCs are coming from the production of CFC-replacement chemicals, the world might need to think differently about HFCs, and perhaps even the next-generation of refrigerant chemicals \u2014 hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) \u2014 Vollmer says. HFO production can emit CFCs too, he says.And if the problem continues, Vollmer adds, amendments might be needed to the Montreal Protocol to address this by-product problem head-on.\u201cWhat this does show is that we need to keep our eyes open,\u201d Engel says. \u201cThe story is not over.\u201ddoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00940-2ReferencesWestern, L.

    "summary": "Researchers have found that levels of five banned CFCs have risen rapidly from 2010 to 2020, contradicting the successful Montreal Protocol that had called for their global phase-out by 2010. The CFCs are not currently a threat to the ozone layer's healing, but their impact on Earth's climate is significant, calling for additional concern. Chemical production could be causing the accidental release of three chemicals, while the root cause of the other two chemicals' elevation remains unknown, suggesting that increased global monitoring of CFCs is necessary. The article highlights the need to keep a close watch on the atmosphere's dangers, and possible amendments to the Montreal Protocol to address the by-product problem head-on may be needed.",

    "hn_content": "Levels of banned CFCs are rising, according to a report. The increase of CFC-13 emissions is particularly concerning since there are no known chemical processes that would produce it. The report suggests that managing refrigerants is a top solution to limit warming. The warming effect of CFCs is equivalent to the emissions produced by a small country like Switzerland. The anticipated impact of CFC emissions on stratospheric ozone recovery is minor, but ongoing emissions may negate some of the benefits gained under the Montreal Protocol if they continue to rise. Both the ozone hole and global warming matter.Experts refute the claim that record snowpacks are evidence against global warming due to the phenomenon of climate change, which happens as a result of energy input from the system. A lack of studies on pre-CFC UV exposure methods, as well as early adaptations, made it hard to calculate their effects. There is a mismatch of incentives between factories, politicians, regulations or enforcement and individuals, who bear the risk of skin cancer. China has also been called out as a potential culprit in HFC and CFC production, with progressive climate change policies in Western countries facing an impenetrable barrier to implementation in totalitarian societies.Comments on Hacker News discuss potential ways to address environmental concerns related to the production of goods in countries with less regulation. Suggestions include starting with products with a known environmental impact and imposing escalating tariffs on noncompliant nations, although some warn of potential economic consequences. The discussion also touches on nuclear power as a potential solution to the energy crisis. However, there is debate over whether diplomatic means are effective in convincing other nations to lower their carbon emissions.A call for tariffs on goods produced by states who prioritize polluting power generation and potential immigration quotas for their citizens based on emission standards. The US and China's emission comparison shows a decrease in the US per capita emissions (-27%) starting 1973 and a decrease in the country's emission overall\u00a0since 2007 (-13%), whereas for the same period, China has had a 7x increase per capita since 1973 (+532%)\u00a0and 48% increase for its global emission since 2007. A suggestion to regulate our supply chains and pressure manufacturers elsewhere, with carbon taxes representing an actual solution instead of holding up a futile fight we're having now in efforts to address climate change.\u00a0The complexity of energy systems and non-human incentives obscure simple solutions to ecological problems. Fracturing the world into the West and China negates ecological forces that affect the planet. Consumers must buy things with a transparent supply chain, look for ESG reports on their purchases and boycott China. Economic sanctions alone are insufficient; China and India must cooperate. Therefore, a carbon tariff on goods imported from dirty countries to make their goods less competitive and to provide incentives for clean manufacturing can be considered. Similarly, a minimum VAT tax can serve as a stepping stone towards closing down several tax loopholes.An HN user points out that while the United States has been reducing emissions, China hasn't been doing enough, and that as a nation we pollute twice as much as China, even if we outsource some of our pollution to China by having them do our manufacturing. The consequences of climate change are growing worse, and the US risks being left behind in sustainability efforts. The general sentiment is that solutions must be reached, not piecemeal progress, and that the discussion of alternative solutions should not be watered-down by generalizations such as EVs for all. It is important to weigh emission output by population and trade to account for outsourced emissions. The urgency to begin prevention initiatives is suggested to avoid a potential decrease in personal quality of life, even if the cost and implementation of such initiatives may be difficult.An HN discussion on fighting climate change with comments ranging from questioning the effectiveness of individual actions, the importance of taking responsibility for past emissions, and the potential for wealthy nations' investment in renewable energy to spur adoption in developing countries. The discussion also touches on the idea of whether or not Westerners should be making sacrifices to fight climate change while other major population centers continue to grow increasingly wealthy. The conversation highlights the need for a long-term global effort to address climate change and the potential for green technologies to be adopted by developing nations.Experts warn that China's ongoing lack of effort towards climate change may actually put them in a winning position when global standards are finally enforced, due to their investments in green technology. An HN user suggests that China may not be accurately reporting CO2, HFCs, and CFCs. Others speculate that perhaps old equipment and landfills are leaking the banned chemicals, while another user suggests that companies may be hoarding stockpiles of the substances. The ban on CFCs is praised as a success, and experts urge finding culprits to pressure into complying with international goals. Concerns over transitioning off petroleum are also discussed.",

When we launched, generative AI was starting to go mainstream: stable diffusion had just been released and was captivating people\u2019s imagination and fueling an explosion in developer activity, Jasper announced a funding round, and investors released the first Gen AI market maps.Alongside this boon in content creation, people started to realize that the true power of this technology was not using a language model in isolation, but using the language model as part of a new, more intelligent system. Developers were discussing how to connect language models to their own proprietary documents, APIs, and structured data. Research papers like Self-Ask with Search and ReAct were published, demonstrating the power of these approaches.Amongst these early tremors of a tectonic shift in computing, we released the first version of the LangChain Python package on October 24th, 2022. In the very first tweet thread, Harrison said:\u201ca python package aimed at helping build LLM applications through composability\u201d\u201cThe real power comes when you are able to combine [LLMs] with other things.\u201d\u201cLangChain aims to help with that by creating\u2026 a comprehensive collection of pieces you would ever want to combine\u2026 a flexible interface for combining pieces into a single comprehensive \u2018chain\u2019\u201dWhy Raise Funding?This all started as an open-source side project, without any intention of building a company. It began by noticing common patterns in how people were approaching problems, and attempting to create abstractions that made it easier. These first simple abstractions struck a chord and the project took off, thanks largely to your community support and contributions. LangChain now has over 20K stars on GitHub, 10K active Discord members, over 30K followers on Twitter, and - most importantly - over 350 contributors.It became clear that the combination of LangChain + LLMs blows open the frontier of amazing products and applications to be built. And, it also is clear that far more work and tooling are needed to make these applications work well (particularly in production). You\u2019re asking us every day for more (400+ GitHub issues, 100 open PRs) and we want to help!With that in mind, we are excited to publicly announce that we have raised $10 million in seed funding. Benchmark led the round and we\u2019re thrilled to have their counsel as they\u2019ve been the first lead investors in some of the iconic open source software we all use including Docker, Confluent, Elastic, Clickhouse and more. With this capital we are going to invest aggressively to keep up with the ground breaking work the community is doing building intelligent apps. Our goal is simple: empower developers to build useful applications powered by language models.So what can you expect from us?LangChain TodayLangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models, offered as both a Python and a TypeScript package. We believe that the most powerful and differentiated language model applications will:Be data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of dataBe agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environmentThe LangChain framework is designed with the above objective principles in mind. We believe that the two main value props it provides are:ComponentsLangChain offers a modular set of abstractions and components that provide everything developers need to build applications using language models. It also includes collections of implementations for these abstractions.These components are largely community driven. There are over 300 contributors on the Python repo alone. Some highlights:Integrations with 20+ different model providers or hosting platformsCollection of 50+ Document Loaders to load data from different sourcesCollection of 10+ methods for splitting text data into chunks so that a Language Model can easily use itIntegrations with 10+ different vector databasesCollection of 15+ different tools to let Language Models usePre-built Chains and AgentsChains allow developers to assemble components in a specific manner to accomplish a particular task, such as summarizing a large pdf document or querying a SQL database. Agents can be thought of as \u201cdynamic chains\u201d in which the sequence of steps taken are determined by a language model on the fly. In addition to providing a high-level interface that makes it easy for developers to create custom chains and agents, LangChain provides many pre-built ones that can be used out-of-the-box.Again, these components are largely community driven. Some highlights:Implementations of ~20 different chainsImplementations of 6 different generic agent types (chains specifically designed to use tools and interact with the outside world)Implementations of 7 different \u201cAgent Toolkits\u201d (agents equipped with a specific set of tools to accomplish a specific task)Future PlansAs mentioned earlier, we believe that language models are unlocking new types of high-value applications, and it is still non-trivial to create and maintain these applications \u2014 particularly in production settings. Some of our more recent releases are focused on addressing these problems:Bringing the TypeScript package up to feature parity with Python to enable more full-stack and frontend developers to create LLM applicationsImplementing several types of OutputParsers, to allow for more safety and guidance on the text returned by a LLMIntroducing a Retriever abstraction to enable more complicated and necessary types of document retrievalBuilding integrations with solutions like Weights & Biases, AIM, ClearML to enable more observability and experimentation with LLM applicationsWe will continue to add features to LangChain and provide other offerings that will:Make it easy to quickly prototype applications.Bridge the gap between prototyping and putting something into production.We\u2019re incredibly excited to see what will be built and to do more to support you. We are also especially grateful to the entire LangChain community. LangChain will continue to be open-source and focused on developers \u2014 our funding allows us to allocate more resources to take it to the next level. If this mission and journey sounds interesting to you, we are actively hiring founding engineers. If you have suggestions on new features or are interested in evaluating and running your LangChain applications in production, we\u2019d especially love to hear from you at support@langchain.dev!Thank you for everything so far, and let\u2019s build some cool stuff \ud83d\ude42          Custom Agents        One of the most common requests we've heard is better functionality and documentation for creating custom agents. This has always been a bit tricky - because in our mind it's actually still very unclear what an \"agent\" actually is, and therefor what the \"right\" abstractions for them may be. Recently,Apr 3, 20233 min read          Retrieval        TL;DR: We are adjusting our abstractions to make it easy for other retrieval methods besides the LangChain VectorDB object to be used in LangChain. This is done with the goals of (1) allowing retrievers constructed elsewhere to be used more easily in LangChain, (2) encouraging more experimentation with alternativeMar 23, 20234 min read          LangChain + Zapier Natural Language Actions (NLA)        We are super excited to team up with Zapier and integrate their new Zapier NLA API into LangChain, which you can now use with your agents and chains.

    "hn_content": "LangChain announces $10M seed funding round, leading to a discussion among Hacker News users about gaps in documentation, the ergonomics of LangChain and its potential in production, and how the AI community can advance the LLM framework. Users note LangChain is outdated and copycats may disrupt the field, but others argue that frameworks are fluid and creative hackers could pursue new approaches. While some criticize the documentation, others recommend accompanying blog posts and suggest that AI-generated documentation could be a solution, utilizing LangChain itself.The tech industry is seeing a ferocious competition in the AI space with huge seed rounds being raised by Langchain and fixie.ai. However, some are concerned that the investment frenzy could lead to a commercial monopolization of the industry, leaving little room for true innovation. An HN user suggests that the VC-funded fiefdoms are not truly innovative and merely offer commercial applications of already developed scientific innovations. Despite the potential risks, many startups are cashing in on the GPT-3 wave, with chatbots being allowed for over a year. The future of Python in the face of a potential second AI winter and concerns over model weights being copyrightable is also under discussion.LangChain is an AI-based software library for composing LLM-powered systems together. The team has been funded with seed money and they plan to turn the library into a polished product by offering prebuilt hosted services for developers. The team will use monetization strategies such as consulting and paid plugins to generate revenue. Some users are concerned that LangChain may suffer the same fate as other open source projects that were tainted by VC cash. HN users discuss technical mitigations that can help foundation models stay in line with fair use, however, more research is needed to align mitigation strategies with the current state of the law. There is some confusion about the constructs of the LangChain codebase, despite its growing popularity. The use of pydantic is seen as un-pythonic and brittle to some users, despite others finding it essential to validate requests.LangChain, a popular open-source tool for composing language models in AI, has raised $10 million in seed funding, much to the dismay of some developers who criticize FOSS projects raising VC funding. Some developers question the effectiveness of LangChain, claiming it is \"haphazardly slapped together\" and only offers standardization of composing language model prompts. Despite this, LangChain is considered the most mature tool in the growing LLM revolution and expects to use the funding to expand the project\u2019s ecosystem and better serve the community. Some developers note the need for more documentation, while others predict it could become the \"backend\" for many AI-based SaaS companies.Langchain has raised a $10 million seed round, prompting concerns among some contributors that the project's incentives may have shifted away from open source towards a for-profit business model. Some commenters criticize the project's documentation and urge contributors to fork the codebase. Others are optimistic about the project's potential and congratulate the team on their progress. The investment is seen as a bet on Langchain's vision, and some express interest in potential job opportunities. There are concerns about Langchain's monetization strategy and competition in the field.",
