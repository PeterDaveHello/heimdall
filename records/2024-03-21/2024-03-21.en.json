    "commentBody": "Shattered Pixel Dungeon is an open-source traditional roguelike dungeon crawler (github.com/00-evan)467 points by notamy 9 hours agohidepastfavorite127 comments 6mian 3 minutes agohttps://pixeldungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Shattered_Pixel_Dungeon is a great resource if you are new to the game and genre, although I suggest first trying discovering everything by yourself (prepare to die a lot) and start reading the wiki after getting through the first boss on lvl 5. I've been playing SPD for years now and for me the best strategy to win the game is to keep Scrolls of Upgrade until you get a hold of a weapon of at least tier 4, same goes for armor. This makes the initial levels much more risky, but if you survive it's a matter of not making mistakes or getting yourself into high risk situations. Using this method I get to the Amulet in about 30% of the runs. Since the recent updates getting back to the ground has become a much more fun challenge. Besides postponing the use of Scrolls of Upgrade, here are a few things that work for me: * You don't have to identify potions and scrolls right away, often you can keep them until you gather more information. For example, killed flies sometimes drop health potion and they are on early levels, so you can learn the color without using it. * Before you get the Scroll Holder that protects the scrolls from fire, it's a good idea to stash all the scrolls in water at the beginning of each level and retrieve them back before going to the next one. * Scrolls of Mapping are absolutely crucial on levels >20 because of the traps and they are relatively cheap in the first two shops. * Summoning trap rooms are great to gather a lot of xp if you have potions of paralytic gas and fire/toxic gas. After the level is cleared, you just open the doors by throwing something at it, go as far away as possible, throw paralytic and then fire/toxic potions. And run to the next level. If you like the game, consider donating to the project, you can do this directly in the game, at least in the Android version. reply rjmill 9 hours agoprevWell, there goes the rest of the week. I don't install games on my phone, but I always give SPD a pass because open source. The first time I installed it, I almost lost an internship because I was too focused on the game. The most recent time I installed it, my wife thought I was cheating on her because I was acting so shady and obsessive about my phone. Don't say I didn't warn y'all. reply katzenversteher 5 minutes agoparentI had the same issue and my solution was: I modified the code of the game to add cheats (make my character super durable), compiled it myself and loaded the apk onto my phone. Then I finally finished the game and my addiction ended. reply Quiark 8 hours agoparentprevIf you only play open source mobile games and are afraid of wasting your time, make sure you avoid the factory tower defense game Mindustry which presents itself at https://mindustrygame.github.io/ reply ComodoHacker 31 minutes agorootparentAnd if you play on PC, also avoid Tales of Maj'Eyal (https://te4.org/), because of its depth and almost infinite replayability. reply rjmill 8 hours agorootparentprevOh no, it's on f-droid, my hands are tied! I'll have to ahem contribute my free time to this important open source library. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentprevI have tried multiple times to play Mindustry, but always end giving up, it doesn't seem that well tested on touch screens. On one of my phones it doesn't even render whole the items on the screen, making some actions unselectable. reply subtra3t 8 hours agorootparentprevWas on my way to suggest this game to avoid, which is also available for free on desktop. reply rizky05 5 hours agorootparentMan, anyone will do what you are suggesting to avoid! we will bear the sin together. reply epiccoleman 7 hours agorootparentprevHonestly though, Mindustry is so much better with keyboard/mouse controls. It's a shockingly good mobile factory/automation type game, but I'd just rather play it on PC. (Or Mac, which runs it fine) reply IggleSniggle 6 hours agorootparentSure, but it's much harder to hide your laptop screen under the covers at 2am, back to spouse, shielding the light, keeping your secret safe. Plus, a screen tap is much quieter than a laptop k/m. ...What? Nobody else is doing this? reply ronyeh 5 hours agoparentprevThey should put this review on their repo README. It’s making me want to play it. But it’s also making me scared to play it. reply suprjami 4 hours agoparentprevMake sure you don't install Caves then, it's even better. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=thirty.six.dev... reply sspiff 3 hours agorootparentContains ads, hard pass. reply stavros 41 minutes agorootparentI made a relevant thing: https://nobsgames.stavros.io/ reply sspiff 9 minutes agorootparentI've been on this page before!

One of the nicest features is that whenever you observe an effect that unambiguously tells you what a potion/scroll does - such as throwing a potion - that type of object is automatically identified for you. In more \"traditional\" hack games you'd have to write notes yourself even though obviously a thrown potion exploding into fire means it's a potion of liquid fire, right? Shattered Pixel is a good way to kill some time on public transit or similar. reply notamy 9 hours agoparent> I'm not really sure what this is doing on Hacker News Incredibly fun game, open source, and in a genre that likely fits well into many HN users' interests. I rediscovered it recently and remembered it was open source, so why not submit it? reply DrSiemer 2 hours agorootparentThe title should include a [year], to save people like me from needing to check if anything significant changed in the game that made me miss half of a trip to Thailand in 2014. reply klik99 8 hours agoparentprevI saw this post and immediately thought “there’s probably a lot of potential trad roguelike fans on hacker news”, for one thing it’s probably the genre with highest percentage of fans are devs or have dabbled into game dev. SPD is a good gateway to brogue, DCSS, cogmind, qud, etc reply aireo 8 hours agorootparentI’ve already mentioned Cogmind, but Brogue is a beautiful game with tight gameplay. Another great recommendation. reply IggleSniggle 5 hours agorootparentIt's not a roguelike really, but Brogue was my gateway to CDDA (Catalysm: Dark Days Ahead). Not sure if I've lost more of my life to one of those or to Slay the Spire. I don't regret it one bit. Been meaning to get into Cogmind (which seems even more aesthetically appealing than Brogue) and Caves of Qud, but I have children now, and must wait until they are of age before re-engaging with such things. reply aireo 4 hours agorootparentBrogue was my introduction to the genre. I also tried Golden Krone Hotel, a beginner-friendly title (and the first one I beat)! I played CoQ for a while, too, but there's something about Cogmind that clicked with me. I'm not very good at it, but it's a _total_ blast. And I agree with you -- it is, imo, the most beautiful roguelike that I've seen or played. And it's got hundreds of unique sound effects, too, which makes a huge difference. I've thought about CDDA, but honestly, the amount of material there is intimidating. But it looks very cool. These games are indeed dangerous! I don't have kids, but I'm still in school, so I have to be careful. When you have some time, definitely give Cogmind a try. Hope you enjoy it! reply II2II 8 hours agoparentprevThe fun part is trying to identify certain items before actually using them. (The guesses won't always be perfect, but you can greatly improve your odds.) reply mminer237 6 hours agoparentprevDon't Nethack and DCSS do that as well? reply schoen 5 hours agorootparentDCSS does; NetHack sometimes does but there are very many cases in which you observe some effect and are then asked \"Call a milky potion:\" or \"Call a scroll labeled ANDOVA BEGARIN:\". reply ToValueFunfetti 9 hours agoparentprevNethack identifies objects once you've observed their effect as well reply Pwntheon 5 hours agorootparentOnly in the most obvious of cases. Your cat reluctantly steps on an item? Cursed. Grey stone moved less than X tiles when kicked? Loadstone. Hundreds of these. reply schoen 5 hours agorootparentprevSome, but not all. For example, \"Call a white potion:\" or \"Call a scroll labeled VE FORBRYDERNE:\" prompts. These often appear after observing an effect where an experienced player or one consulting spoilers knows what the potion or scroll must be, but the game didn't auto-ID it. reply lupusreal 41 minutes agoparentprevIt would be nice if you could manually identity items though; sometimes the context you get a potion from tells you what the potion is but you have to remember that until you use it. Using the stones of intuition for this kind of seems wasteful. reply jasonjmcghee 8 hours agoparentprevGame dev is historically pretty popular on hn. reply uaserussia 8 hours agoparentprevSkyrim had that mechanic. You could eat ingredients for potions and if you had a duplicate it would tell you the effects, and the next time you found the ingredient again you would know what it was. reply zelphirkalt 2 hours agorootparentGood that they also have potions, so that no poison in the world is strong enough to kill you in Skyrim (or is there one?) reply mock-possum 4 hours agoparentprevI can also recommend POWDER as a solid not-many-frills classic roguelite. reply codetrotter 8 hours agoprevSo after reading the positive comments here I went ahead and bought a copy for iPhone in the App Store. I was hoping that it supports controllers, as i recently bought a pretty neat controller that you plug the phone into the middle of, and you get buttons and thumb sticks on each side of the screen. Kind of similar to the joycons you have with a Nintendo Switch. This controller is PlayStation branded, but produced by a different company that has licensed the right to brand the controller that way. Anyway, I am happy to report that yes indeed this game works with my controller. Left thumb stick moves the character around, and right thumb sticks moves a sort of aiming square around! Edit: the pointer sensitivity was a bit high for me, but it is adjustable in the game settings and after adjusting it it is comfortable reply aireo 8 hours agoprevI hadn’t played games for a long time, mostly because of school, but recently I picked up Cogmind, a fantastic sci-fi roguelike. Basically, you’re a robot that can attach and replace different items, including utilities, propulsion systems, weapons, and power sources. It’s some of the most fun I’ve had playing a game in ages. The developer, Josh Ge, is also very kind and deeply engaged with the community, which is great. Highly recommended! reply jpsouth 8 hours agoprevI’ve played this for a while, and not to brag, but I’ve got to chapter two on a warrior AND mage. I love the identification process and relatively quick, albeit very tactical if you want, gameplay. It’s my go to iPhone game when on short journeys, mostly because I can just save where I am and pick up whenever without having to remember dungeon layout or potions/food etc. reply magicalhippo 5 hours agoprevSemi-unrelated but this reminded me of the countless hours I spent playing Castle of the Winds[1] as a kid. Based on this thread I went searching for it and, as it turns out, the original author is working on porting[2] it to Unity!

Obviously there was no way for me to pay or get the full software, so I spent hours and hours playing the same levels over and over in the demo. I loved Castle of the Winds, and another turn-based games with pirates. There was also a similar one with tanks and such, called Metal Knights maybe? reply jd3 5 hours agoparentprevWhile imperfect, I nevertheless adored Reign of Swords/Clash of Kingdom on my old iPod touch back in ~2008. I've looked for a replacement for years but 99.9% of similar games on the App Store are spam/pay to win/microtransaction hell with the typical cheap ugly \"international\" art style. https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/06/reign-of-swords-revi... https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/03/reign-of-swords-2-re... https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/02/07/mobile-battles-reign... http://web.archive.org/web/20111001213349/http://www.mobileb... reply FranOntanaya 2 hours agoparentprevSo many hours trying to farm cube slimes to get rare items in that game. I loved it. reply zeograd 2 hours agoprevIt's an awesome game, I'm playing it non-stop since last summer and embarked my 9-years old daughter along. We're sharing games and exchanging bits of information (yes, she's thinking out of the box, and it sometimes works :) ) The author, Evan, is maintaining a fediverse community for all mods of the original Pixel Dungeon, accessible via https://photon.lemmy.world/c/pixeldungeon for instance, after the Reddit troubles from last year. reply KirinDave 9 hours agoprevIf you like these kinds of games but find SPD to be a little too mechanically simple and lacking in build diversity, you may also enjoy DCSS (dungeon crawl stone soup) and my personal favorite: Frogcomposband. You can play the later at angband.live, and it's an exceptional game with incredible depth and variety. reply Al-Khwarizmi 16 minutes agoparentI agree about SPD. While it's great for a mobile game and looks gorgeous, I find the gameplay somewhat shallow for a roguelike. If I have a monitor and keyboard at hand, I prefer to play the likes of ADOM (classic version, not Ultimate), Brogue, Legerdemain, Sil, DCSS, etc. which offer more depth, strategic complexity and meaningful choices, IMHO. Haven't tried the frog one, will do at some point. reply AtlasBarfed 8 hours agoparentprevAnd BTW, if I can figure out how to do Eclipse CDT and get the source code running in an IDE, so that I can do LOTS of fun things with class skills, you can to! Because the last time I did C/C++ was 1998. Also, Remnants of the Precursors (java) you can do some fun things. I got \"doomstars\" half-implemented, a race skill that marks planets with resources or artifacts (archaeology bonus), and lots of other fun things. I really like open source games, half the fun is hacking them. I have yet to download nethack from the net and hack it though. reply IgorPartola 8 hours agoprevSo I used to play Pixel Dungeon and then saw a bunch of clones that looked like it. Is Shattered Pixel Dungeon the original project or a clone of a closed source game? Or completely unrelated? reply flexagoon 3 hours agoparentThe original Pixel Dungeon was closed source IIRC, but then the developer stopped working on it and released the source code. Now there are many forks/mods of PD, all with different features (the Pixel Dungeon wiki has a great list). Shattered PD is the most popular and polished one, it adds a ton of stuff and is very actively developed. reply bjconlan 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I was looking though the code wondering what java based rendering library this was using but all of these support classes come from \"PD-classes\" (which was sighted in the SPD readme... just never joined the dots) but also pointed me to the creators itch account and relevant \"Generator\" artworks which are all very impressive https://watabou.github.io/ https://watabou.itch.io/ Some really great work here reply grodriguez100 2 hours agorootparentThe original Pixel Dungeon uses a homebrew “engine” (that’s the PD-classes stuff). Shattered uses libgdx. reply knodi123 5 hours agoparentprevIt's a variant, with lots of quality-of-life upgrades, some very well thought-out new mechanics, and new biomes and missions. reply iCarrot 4 hours agorootparentI always found the game becoming easier with more mechanics/weapons/potions added (in other variants). Is this the case with SPD? reply romanows 8 hours agoparentprev\"It's based on the source code of Pixel Dungeon, by Watabou.\" I also played the original Pixel Dungeon, great game and bonus points for being free and open source! reply blacksmith_tb 7 hours agoparentprevI've played a fair number of PD spin-offs / remixes and Shattered stands out as the best. It get regular updates that sometimes add or substantially change large chunks of the game. reply davewasthere 8 hours agoparentprevoriginal creator: https://twitter.com/watawatabou Was always free... now people have gone to town with the source code. reply PlunderBunny 9 hours agoprevI love roguelike games (still miss you 100 Rogues), and I played Shattered Pixel Dungeon 77 times before finally winning with a Rogue class. Once I'd done that, I never had the urge to play it again. reply hamilyon2 21 minutes agoprevHow does it get around apple GPL ban? reply richardwhiuk 10 minutes agoparentIf you own the rights to all of the code, you can dual license under GPL and non-GPL, and then you can post on the appstore. They don't accept code requests, so that might be their strategy reply lambdanil 3 hours agoprevFor those who enjoy SPD I recommend checking out some other popular roguelikes, many of them are also open source. Some of my personal recommendations would be brogue (probably the most beginner friendly), DCSS (friendly, tons of content), ADoM and Cataclysm DDA (a sandbox survival roguelike, quite a unique mix) reply sandspar 1 hour agoparentWhat do these acronyms mean? reply bananicorn 46 minutes agorootparentDCSS = Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup ADoM = Ancient Domains of Mystery Cataclysm DDA = Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead I swear I didn't make the first one up ;) Edit: ah well, you got your answer already^^ reply lambdanil 45 minutes agorootparentprevI should probably have used the full names for clarity, either way the acronyms mean, in order: Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Ancient Domains of Mystery and Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead. reply lensi 1 hour agoprevBut it requires you to login with your Google account. Weird for an open source game. reply gaudystead 45 minutes agoparentFrom my experience, you can just skip it and still play the game. Most of those Google prompts can just be bypassed by hitting the \"back\" button (on android, at least). reply tgkudelski 46 minutes agoparentprevThis is not true. Probably you installed it through the Play store? reply lupusreal 48 minutes agoparentprevNo such requirement if you get it from F-Droid, which you should. reply Townley 9 hours agoprevExcellent game, I lost an embarrassing amount of time last year getting all of the badges. The mobile versions are great because they’re ad-free, and work without internet access when on airplanes. And since it’s turn-based, it’s very interruption-friendly. The Reddit community is also a lot of fun: equal mix of strategy and memes. reply boothby 8 hours agoparentAll of them? I gave up on that goal partway through the pandemic; I spent about a year's worth of occasional games without seeing Tengu and eventually accepted that I wasn't interested enough to get that 6-challenge badge. Strategy on Reddit, you say? Perhaps that could help.

I am curious though, why is the iOS version €4.99 but the Android version is free ? I've seen this a lot actually and have always wondered, I figured it might just be Apple's annual developer license fee but not sure. reply sphars 7 hours agoparentYep that's exactly the reason, plus not wanting to compete with Pixel Dungeon. The developer talked about it when first announcing it was coming to iOS > Shattered Pixel Dungeon will cost $5 US when it fully releases on the App Store. I’m charging because of a mix of Apple’s higher platform fees, not wanting to undercut Pixel Dungeon, and because Shattered is releasing in a much more finished state. https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/shattered-pixel-dungeon-is-c... reply Biganon 1 hour agoparentprevLast time I checked, having an app on the Android app store costs $14 a year, vs $99 a year on the Apple app store reply tecleandor 39 minutes agorootparentIsn't it that the Google Play store is a one-time $25 registration fee (and never again) but the Apple App store is $99 every year? reply chongli 5 hours agoparentprevI’m on iOS and I paid for it without hesitation. Evan deserves it, just read his blog for the game [1] to see how much he puts into it!

    "originBody": "If you read any personal finance forums late last year, there's a decent chance you ran across a question from someone who was desperately trying to lose money before the end of the year. There are a number of ways someone could do this; one commonly suggested scheme was to buy put options that were expected to expire worthless, allowing the buyer to (probably) take a loss. One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there's a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn't have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200/yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they'd be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k. Although that's an unusually severe example, U.S. tax policy is full of discontinuities that disincentivize increasing earnings and, in some cases, actually incentivize decreasing earnings. Some other discontinuities are the TANF income limit, the Medicaid income limit, the CHIP income limit for free coverage, and the CHIP income limit for reduced-cost coverage. These vary by location and circumstance; the TANF and Medicaid income limits fall into ranges generally considered to be \"low income\" and the CHIP limits fall into ranges generally considered to be \"middle class\". These subsidy discontinuities have the same impact as the ACA subsidy discontinuity -- at certain income levels, people are incentivized to lose money. Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes. Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everyone does it, rich and poor alike and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands. If you agree with the famous Learned Hand quote then losing money in order to reduce effective tax rate, increasing disposable income, is completely legitimate behavior at the individual level. However, a tax system that encourages people to lose money, perhaps by funneling it to (on average) much wealthier options traders by buying put options, seems sub-optimal. A simple fix for the problems mentioned above would be to have slow phase-outs instead of sharp thresholds. Slow phase-outs are actually done for some subsidies and, while that can also have problems, they are typically less problematic than introducing a sharp discontinuity in tax/subsidy policy. In this post, we'll look at a variety of discontinuities. Hardware or software queues A naive queue has discontinuous behavior. If the queue is full, new entries are dropped. If the queue isn't full, new entries are not dropped. Depending on your goals, this can often have impacts that are non-ideal. For example, in networking, a naive queue might be considered \"unfair\" to bursty workloads that have low overall bandwidth utilization because workloads that have low bandwidth utilization \"shouldn't\" suffer more drops than workloads that are less bursty but use more bandwidth (this is also arguably not unfair, depending on what your goals are). A class of solutions to this problem are random early drop and its variants, which gives incoming items a probability of being dropped which can be determined by queue fullness (and possibly other factors), smoothing out the discontinuity and mitigating issues caused by having a discontinuous probability of queue drops. This post on voting in link aggregators is fundamentally the same idea although, in some sense, the polarity is reversed. There's a very sharp discontinuity in how much traffic something gets based on whether or not it's on the front page. You could view this as a link getting dropped from a queue if it only receives N-1 votes and not getting dropped if it receives N votes. College admissions and Pell Grant recipients Pell Grants started getting used as a proxy for how serious schools are about helping/admitting low-income students. The first order impact is that students above the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly reduced probability of being admitted while students below the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly higher chance of being admitted. Phrased that way, it sounds like things are working as intended. However, when we look at what happens within each group, we see outcomes that are the opposite of what we'd want if the goal is to benefit students from low income families. Among people who don't qualify for a Pell Grant, it's those with the lowest income who are the most severely impacted and have the most severely reduced probability of admission. Among people who do qualify, it's those with the highest income who are mostly likely to benefit, again the opposite of what you'd probably want if your goal is to benefit students from low income families. We can see these in the graphs below, which are histograms of parental income among students at two universities in 2008 (first graph) and 2016 (second graph), where the red line indicates the Pell Grant threshold. A second order effect of universities optimizing for Pell Grant recipients is that savvy parents can do the same thing that some people do to cut their taxable income at the last minute. Someone might put money into a traditional IRA instead of a Roth IRA and, if they're at their IRA contribution limit, they can try to lose money on options, effectively transferring money to options traders who are likely to be wealthier than them, in order to bring their income below the Pell Grant threshold, increasing the probability that their children will be admitted to a selective school. Election statistics The following histograms of Russian elections across polling stations shows curious spikes in turnout and results at nice, round, numbers (e.g., 95%) starting around 2004. This appears to indicate that there's election fraud via fabricated results and that at least some of the people fabricating results don't bother with fabricating results that have a smooth distribution. For finding fraudulent numbers, also see, Benford's law. Used car sale prices Mark Ainsworth points out that there are discontinuities at $10k boundaries in U.S. auto auction sales prices as well as volume of vehicles offered at auction. The price graph below adjusts for a number of factors such as model year, but we can see the same discontinuities in the raw unadjusted data. p-values Authors of psychology papers are incentivized to produce papers with p values below some threshold, usually 0.05, but sometimes 0.1 or 0.01. Masicampo et al. plotted p values from papers published in three psychology journals and found a curiously high number of papers with p values just below 0.05. The spike at p = 0.05 consistent with a number of hypothesis that aren't great, such as: Authors are fudging results to get p = 0.05 Journals are much more likely to accept a paper with p = 0.05 than if p = 0.055 Authors are much less likely to submit results if p = 0.055 than if p = 0.05 Head et al. (2015) surveys the evidence across a number of fields. Andrew Gelman and others have been campaigning to get rid of the idea of statistical significance and p-value thresholds for years, see this paper for a short summary of why. Not only would this reduce the incentive for authors to cheat on p values, there are other reasons to not want a bright-line rule to determine if something is \"significant\" or not. Drug charges The top two graphs in this set of four show histograms of the amount of cocaine people were charged with possessing before and after the passing of the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which raised the amount of cocaine necessary to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for possession from 50g to 280g. There's a relatively smooth distribution before 2010 and a sharp discontinuity after 2010. The bottom-left graph shows the sharp spike in prosecutions at 280 grams followed by what might be a drop in 2013 after evidentiary standards were changed1. High school exit exam scores This is a histogram of high school exit exam scores from the Polish language exam. We can see that a curiously high number of students score 30 or just above thirty while curiously low number of students score from 23-29. This is from 2013; other years I've looked at (2010-2012) show a similar discontinuity. Math exit exam scores don't exhibit any unusual discontinuities in the years I've examined (2010-2013). An anonymous reddit commenter explains this: When a teacher is grading matura (final HS exam), he/she doesn't know whose test it is. The only things that are known are: the number (code) of the student and the district which matura comes from (it is usually from completely different part of Poland). The system is made to prevent any kind of manipulation, for example from time to time teachers supervisor will come to check if test are graded correctly. I don't wanna talk much about system flaws (and advantages), it is well known in every education system in the world where final tests are made, but you have to keep in mind that there is a key, which teachers follow very strictly when grading. So, when a score of the test is below 30%, exam is failed. However, before making final statement in protocol, a commision of 3 (I don't remember exact number) is checking test again. This is the moment, where difference between humanities and math is shown: teachers often try to find a one (or a few) missing points, so the test won't be failed, because it's a tragedy to this person, his school and somewhat fuss for the grading team. Finding a \"missing\" point is not that hard when you are grading writing or open questions, which is a case in polish language, but nearly impossible in math. So that's the reason why distribution of scores is so different. As with p values, having a bright-line threshold, causes curious behavior. In this case, scoring below 30 on any subject (a 30 or above is required in every subject) and failing the exam has arbitrary negative effects for people, so teachers usually try to prevent people from failing if there's an easy way to do it, but a deeper root of the problem is the idea that it's necessary to produce a certification that's the discretization of a continuous score. Birth month and sports These are scatterplots of football (soccer) players in the UEFA Youth League. The x-axis on both of these plots is how old players are modulo the year, i.e., their birth month normalized from 0 to 1. The graph on the left is a histogram, which shows that there is a very strong relationship between where a person's birth falls within the year and their odds of making a club at the UEFA Youth League (U19) level. The graph on the right purports to show that birth time is only weakly correlated with actual value provided on the field. The authors use playing time as a proxy for value, presumably because it's easy to measure. That's not a great measure, but the result they find (younger-within-the-year players have higher value, conditional on making the U19 league) is consistent with other studies on sports and discrimination, which ind (for example) that black baseball players were significantly better than white baseball players for decades after desegregation in baseball, French-Canadian defensemen are also better than average (French-Canadians are stereotypically afraid to fight, don't work hard enough, and are too focused on offense). The discontinuity isn't directly shown in the graphs above because the graphs only show birth date for one year. If we were to plot birth date by cohort across multiple years, we'd expect to see a sawtooth pattern in the probability that a player makes it into the UEFA youth league with a 10x difference between someone born one day before vs. after the threshold. This phenomenon, that birth day or month is a good predictor of participation in higher-level youth sports as well as pro sports, has been studied across a variety of sports. It's generally believed that this is caused by a discontinuity in youth sports: Kids are bucketed into groups by age in years and compete against people in the same year Within a given year, older kids are stronger, faster, etc., and perform better This causes older-within-year kids to outcompete younger kids, which later results in older-within-year kids having higher levels of participation for a variety of reasons This is arguably a \"bug\" in how youth sports works. But as we've seen in baseball as well as a survey of multiple sports, obviously bad decision making that costs individual teams tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars can persist for decades in the face of people pubicly discussing how bad the decisions are. In this case, the youth sports teams aren't feeder teams to pro teams, so they don't have a financial incentive to select players who are skilled for their age (as opposed to just taller and faster because they're slightly older) so this system-wide non-optimal even more difficult to fix than pro sports teams making locally non-optimal decisions that are completely under their control. Procurement auctions Kawai et al. looked at Japanese government procurement, in order to find suspicious pattern of bids like the ones described in Porter et al. (1993), which looked at collusion in procurement auctions on Long Island (in New York in the United States). One example that's given is: In February 1983, the New York State Department of Transportation (DoT) held a pro- curement auction for resurfacing 0.8 miles of road. The lowest bid in the auction was $4 million, and the DoT decided not to award the contract because the bid was deemed too high relative to its own cost estimates. The project was put up for a reauction in May 1983 in which all the bidders from the initial auction participated. The lowest bid in the reauction was 20% higher than in the initial auction, submitted by the previous low bidder. Again, the contract was not awarded. The DoT held a third auction in February 1984, with the same set of bidders as in the initial auction. The lowest bid in the third auction was 10% higher than the second time, again submitted by the same bidder. The DoT apparently thought this was suspicious: “It is notable that the same firm submitted the low bid in each of the auctions. Because of the unusual bidding patterns, the contract was not awarded through 1987.” It could be argued that this is expected because different firms have different cost structures, so the lowest bidder in an auction for one particular project should be expected to be the lowest bidder in subsequent auctions for the same project. In order to distinguish between collusion and real structural cost differences between firms, Kawai et al. (2015) looked at auctions where the difference in bid between the first and second place firms was very small, making the winner effectively random. In the auction structure studied, bidders submit a secret bid. If the secret bid is above a secret minimum, then the lowest bidder wins the auction and gets the contract. If not, the lowest bid is revealed to all bidders and another round of bidding is done. Kawai et al. found that, in about 97% of auctions, the bidder who submitted the lowest bid in the first round also submitted the lowest bid in the second round (the probability that the second lowest bidder remains second lowest was 26%). Below, is a histogram of the difference in first and second round bids between the first-lowest and second-lowest bidders (left column) and the second-lowest and third-lowest bidders (right column). Each row has a different filtering criteria for how close the auction has to be in order to be included. In the top row, all auctions that reached the third round were included; in second, and third rows, the normalized delta between the first and second biders was less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively; in the last row, the normalized delta between the first and the third bidder was less than 0.03. All numbers are normalized because the absolute size of auctions can vary. We can see that the distributions of deltas between the first and second round are roughly symmetrical when comparing second and third lowest bidders. But when comparing first and second lowest bidders, there's a sharp discontinuity at zero, indicating that second-lowest bidder almost never lowers their bid by more than the first-lower bidder did. If you read the paper, you can see that the same structure persists into auctions that go into a third round. I don't mean to pick on Japanese procurement auctions in particular. There's an extensive literature on procurement auctions that's found collusion in many cases, often much more blatant than the case presented above (e.g., there are a few firms and they round-robin who wins across auctions, or there are a handful of firms and every firm except for the winner puts in the same losing bid). Restaurant inspection scores The histograms below show a sharp discontinuity between 13 and 14, which is the difference between an A grade and a B grade. It appears that some regions also have a discontinuity between 27 and 28, which is the difference between a B and a C and this older analysis from 2014 found what appears to be a similar discontinuity between B and C grades. Inspectors have discretion in what violations are tallied and it appears that there are cases where restaurant are nudged up to the next higher grade. Marathon finishing times A histogram of marathon finishing times (finish times on the x-axis, count on the y-axis) across 9,789,093 finishes shows noticeable discontinuities at every half hour, as well as at \"round\" times like :10, :15, and :20. An analysis of times within each race (see section 4.4, figures 7-9) indicates that this is at least partially because people speed up (or slow down less than usual) towards the end of races if they're close to a \"round\" time2. Notes This post doesn't really have a goal or a point, it's just a collection of discontinuities that I find fun. One thing that's maybe worth noting is that I've gotten a lot of mileage out in my career both out of being suspicious of discontinuities and figuring out where they come from and also out of applying standard techniques to smooth out discontinuities. For finding discontinuities, basic tools like \"drawing a scatterplot\", \"drawing a histogram\", \"drawing the CDF\" often come in handy. Other kinds of visualizations that add temporality, like flamescope, can also come in handy. We noted above that queues create a kind of discontinuity that, in some circumstances, should be smoothed out. We also noted that we see similar behavior for other kinds of thresholds and that randomization can be a useful tool to smooth out discontinuities in thresholds as well. Randomization can also be used to allow for reducing quantization error when reducing precision with ML and in other applications. Thanks to Leah Hanson, Omar Rizwan, Dmitry Belenko, Kamal Marhubi, Danny Vilea, Nick Roberts, Lifan Zeng, Mark Ainsworth, Wesley Aptekar-Cassels, Thomas Hauk, @BaudDev, and Michael Sullivan for comments/corrections/discussion. Also, please feel free to send me other interesting discontinuities! Most online commentary I've seen about this paper is incorrect. I've seen this paper used as evidence of police malfeasance because the amount of cocaine seized jumped to 280g. This is the opposite of what's described in the paper, where the author notes that, based on drug seizure records, amounts seized do not appear to be the cause of this change. After noting that drug seizures are not the cause, the author notes that prosecutors can charge people for amounts that are not the same as the amount seized and then notes: I do find bunching at 280g after 2010 in case management data from the Executive Office of the US Attorney (EOUSA). I also find that approximately 30% of prosecutors are responsible for the rise in cases with 280g after 2010, and that there is variation in prosecutor-level bunching both within and between districts. Prosecutors who bunch cases at 280g also have a high share of cases right above 28g after 2010 (the 5-year threshold post-2010) and a high share of cases above 50g prior to 2010 (the 10-year threshold pre-2010). Also, bunching above a mandatory minimum threshold persists across districts for prosecutors who switch districts. Moreover, when a “bunching” prosecutor switches into a new district, all other attorneys in that district increase their own bunching at mandatory minimums. These results suggest that the observed bunching at sentencing is specifically due to prosecutorial discretion This is mentioned in the abstract and then expounded on in the introduction (the quoted passage is from the introduction), so I think that most people commenting on this paper can't have read it. I've done a few surveys of comments on papers on blog posts and I generally find that, in cases where it's possible to identify this (e.g., when the post is mistitled), the vast majority of commenters can't have read the paper or post they're commenting on, but that's a topic for another post. There is some evidence that something fishy may be going on in seizures (e.g., see Fig. A8.(c)), but if the analysis in the paper is correct, that impact of that is much smaller than the impact of prosecutorial discretion. [return] One of the most common comments I've seen online about this graph and/or this paper is that this is due to pace runners provided by the marathon. Section 4.4 of the paper gives multiple explanations for why this cannot be the case, once again indicating that people tend to comment without reading the paper. [return]",

The school/state had a policy where any independent income earners making less than 35,000/year would not pay tuition. A single dollar over that would require paying full tuition of ~$60/unit or about $750 a semester. One year I worked a little more overtime during the holidays than usual and realized with a week to go in the year that I'd go a few hundred dollars over, so I called out of a few shifts and nearly got fired over it. I barely squeaked in under the limit, and if I hadn't, there was pretty much no way I would have been able to continue school. It's not like I could suddenly afford it now that I made $35,001 vs $34,999.

I've known a lot of different people who were on welfare over the years, and not one of them had a standard of living anywhere close to what someone who nets $60,000 a year does.

If they were getting a $16k tax credit or whatever it must not have been making up for the other costs involved with raising children. Worse than someone who doesn't have to pay raise a kid isn't the same thing as worse than someone else with kids who makes $8000 more and therefore loses the $16,000 credit. And the cliffs are only half the problem. Did you get a childcare subsidy? Only if you use approved providers, which charge more than your older niece would to watch the kids, and now the money goes to some bureaucratic corporation with lawyers and lobbyists instead of your own family, and you see your niece less often and don't talk to her dad as much and now he's less likely to offer to do you a favor when you need one or realize that you do. You also get a housing subsidy, but only for particular housing, which isn't as close to your job or doesn't allow you to pool resources with roommates, so now you have to pay more for transportation or most of the subsidy gets eaten by higher rents etc. The entire welfare system should be vaporized and replaced with a tax credit for the poor (i.e. a UBI). reply gottorf 9 hours agorootparent> The entire welfare system should be vaporized and replaced with a tax credit for the poor (i.e. a UBI). Yep, call it a negative income tax if it goes down better than UBI, but many other things would be better than the system we have now. reply Aerroon 3 hours agorootparentThe problem with UBI isn't so much the politics, it's the feasibility of the cost. $12k a year over 300 million people is 80% of the US government's tax revenue. A negative income tax might work out a lot better on the numbers, but it won't help the people that need it the most (the ones that can't get a job). But hey, maybe it can work. The US has a deficit spending of $1.7 trillion in 2023, $1.4 in 2022, $2.7 in 2021. That $1.7 would cover almost half of a $12k ubi. But how long could that last? reply AnthonyMouse 1 hour agorootparentThe cost is fiction because it's a tax credit. The money is on both sides of the ledger. If you're making $60,000/year and your pre-credit taxes go up by $12,000 and then you get a $12,000 tax credit, you have paid an additional zero dollars in taxes. If you don't make much money and the government used to pay you a net $10,000 in benefits and now you get a $12,000 UBI and pay $2000 in taxes, that hasn't actually cost any additional money, all it does is convert the needlessly inefficient constellation of benefits into cash. The \"universal\" part of a UBI is serving the same purpose as the progressive rate structure in the income tax, i.e. you want an effective rate curve which is higher for the rich than the poor. Which means that you don't need both. What you use instead is a flat tax rate which serves as the de facto \"phase out\" for the UBI. Except that because it's all in one place, there are no cliffs, and there are no poor people paying higher de facto marginal rates than rich people, and there are no mountains of paperwork to apply for benefits. reply advael 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is nonsensical for numerous reasons 1. The federal government doesn't have tax revenue. It issues a currency and then taxes go toward countering inflation. The notion that a currency-issuing government needs to \"balance its budget\" in its own currency is a political fiction. Also, policies that benefit people at the lower end of the income spectrum disproportionately actually move money around in the economy, which generally speaking is less inflationary than allowing it to accumulate in various silos like hedge funds 2. A \"negative income tax\" doesn't have to require employment. You can make zero dollars in income as a self-employed person, and the self-employed still track their income for taxation purposes 3. There are many unnecessary-to-malicious subsidies and inefficient welfare programs that could easily have their rationale subsumed by UBI, and doing so would save considerable cost that is mostly the overhead of all the means-testing personnel and in some cases (like SNAP) completely separate financial machinery necessary to maintain them Even setting all that aside, you could make considerably more \"tax revenue\" by funding the IRS or reversing some of the nakedly corrupt corporate tax breaks that have been created over the last several decades. There always seems to be more money to subsidize artificially lowering the price of certain goods, fund incredibly inefficient private government contractors to do things that once cost considerably less for the government to do itself, fund drug research only to then allow the resulting breakthroughs to be patented by a private firm and then gouge people for treatment, or buy ludicrously expensive weapons for militarized police forces, but propose anything that actually benefits people and suddenly everyone's worried about the costs. Not to put too fine a point on it, but all this \"Well have you considered the cost?\" handwringing people do when UBI comes up just drastically misunderstands how governments use money, while claiming to be \"responsible\" and \"realistic\" reply RhodesianHunter 13 hours agorootparentprev16k wouldn't cover daycare in much of the US let alone food, clothes, etc. reply wizerdrobe 10 hours agorootparentWhat are you imagining the typical rate is in much of America.

Medicaid is cheaper for the government than ACA subsidies (at least for low income people given the way the subsidies are structured), partly because the government has a lot of negotiating power and partly because Medicaid is stingy. This was made worse when the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government couldn't make receiving existing Medicaid funding conditional on Medicaid expansion (Medicaid is partially funded by the federal government, but the program is administered by individual states) so whether the Medicaid expansion is even available to you largely depends on whether your state is run by Democrats or Republicans (with a few notable exceptions). reply chubbyFIREthrwy 10 hours agorootparentPeople like me are an extreme edge case, I doubt this was a big factor in any debate. reply PaulDavisThe1st 13 hours agoparentprevA reminder to anyone reading that there is no actual \"opposite problem\" to yours (which I'm very disturbed to hear about, hope things work out).

Instead there should be a range they slowly decrease, so that if you make $1 more before the benefit you still get less than $1 after. Maybe even a lot less, like only $.30.

A particularly troublesome example I encountered, entirely unrelated to finance, was when working on a renal ward in hospital, we had to count respiration rate and input it into the obs machine, but if you inputted over 16, it would increase their sepsis score (or \"acute deterioration\"), meaning there'd be additional work to be done.

We had an appraiser say that my new construction was going to appraise at $100k under cost -- so my broker fired him, ate the fee, and hired an old friend of his instead.

Then again, the finished house then appraised at $50k _over_ cost 12 months later when I converted the construction loan, so maybe the first appraiser really was nuts. reply jeffbee 17 hours agoparentprevYeah of course, the appraiser is a person who is paid to write down the predetermined number. The US federal government should nuke this industry as part of their crackdown on \"junk fees\". Either the appraiser serves a legitimate arms-length purpose or their whole line of business should go away. reply lesuorac 16 hours agorootparentI think it's really a problem of different incentives. Somebody (A) at the bank does not want to give out loans that are well beyond a properties value. Somebody (B) _else_ at the bank is actually the one giving you the loan and makes money from you getting it. So A requires B to have an appraiser so they can't completely run away writing loans. From talking to some real estate agents, the appraiser will only fudge so much for you. An appraiser might agree that the house is worth 750k even if they actually think its 699k but if you try to get a 700k loan for a 350k house they'll write down 350k in their appraisal. -- IIRC, the government's crack down on \"junk fees\" is mostly that you can't advertise a price and then inflate it later with fees. So as long as the bank states that they require an appraiser and their in-house cost is $X; it doesn't count as a junk fee. But if the bank says that the loan is going to cost say $5k in overhead and then later says it doesn't include appraisal fee then it be a junk fee. reply margalabargala 15 hours agorootparent> An appraiser might agree that the house is worth 750k even if they actually think its 699k but if you try to get a 700k loan for a 350k house they'll write down 350k in their appraisal. This is kind of the point. The appraiser isn't trying to find the \"true value\" of the house, otherwise buyers would hire appraisers prior to even offering a bid. The question that the bank wants answered is, \"is this house sufficiently matched to loan amount such that if the borrower defaults, the house can be sold for enough money to recoup the loan?\" And if the answer is \"yes\", then they write down the number. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentprevI could see a third option as a \"lemon detector\". That is, instead of their output being a number, it would be a binary, intended only to limit downside risk in the worst cases. I think in practice this is indeed the role they play. If I'm \"overpaying\" by 20%, the appraiser will probably still \"write down the predetermined number\", but if I'm overpaying by 100% and taking out a mortgage to do it, there's a pretty good chance that the bank's appraiser is going to sink that deal. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentThat's basically what they do, they're not to find the actual value of the property (that's more properly a tax assessor, perhaps) - they are there to make sure the valuation is \"in the ballpark\" to what it would liquidate for. An appraiser will never get in trouble if a bank forecloses on a $500k property and it sells for $450k or so, but they will get in trouble if the $500k property only sells for $200k - they'd need to explain why. reply xenadu02 11 hours agorootparentprevAppraisals function as a major fraud reducer, especially for internal fraud. Appraisers will fudge $100k on the value of a $1m house because that's their opinion as an appraiser. They won't fudge $1m on the exact same house (2x value). That serves as a kind of cap on funny business to some extent. 10% of the value isn't going to make that much difference on the ability to pay for most borrowers so an excess $100k in the valuation doesn't really matter anyway.

My kid is in 12U youth hockey and is a big guy, and yeah, smaller kids can often usually skate around him, but if they bump into him, they fall over, and often he'll get a \"big kid penalty\" which means he gets a break in the penalty box for the crime of being tall and physically near a smaller player who fell over. We had to do a bit of coaching on how to make (allowed) physical contact so it reasonable contact doesn't look like prohibited contact (mostly be sure to have hands off when kids are falling, it's real easy to look like cross checking when it was actually just incidental contact). Some of the littler kids seem to have a lot of fun getting away with a lot more physical play than he can. Although he says he enjoys it when a small kid gets mad at him and tries to knock him over, too. So at least so far, seems like everyone is having fun. I don't think you can really just bucket kids by size and ignore age though... there's a lot of mental development between 10U hockey and 12U hockey, and putting a big 10 year old on the 12U team is often not right because the level of play is so much different, most 10 year olds won't keep up. At the same time, a small 12 year old on the 10U team is going to have a big advantage from age. Around here we do have two different leagues, one for 'recreational' teams and one for 'reputation' teams, and you more or less have to demonstrate a decent amount of skill to get on the rep team, and then you're playing with much better teams. All the teams are composed of a mix of big and small kids though. Edit to add: All that said, I think bucketing kids by age makes sense and I agree that there can be advantage to being at the extremes of the cohort. Since the US school system usually has a different cutoff date (september-ish) than US youth hockey (jan 1), you might see different results where there's grade level based high school hockey and age based youth hockey... but not in Canada where the cutoff is Jan 1 for both. reply munificent 12 hours agorootparent> I don't think you can really just bucket kids by size and ignore age though... there's a lot of mental development between 10U hockey and 12U hockey, and putting a big 10 year old on the 12U team is often not right because the level of play is so much different, most 10 year olds won't keep up. A friend of mine has a son who is giant for his age. The kid is 7 but he's the size of a late middle-schooler. One of the things that ends up being really difficult for him is that everyone around him assumes that he should be smarter and more mature than he is.

The problem is that these youth sports can get very competitive, and then people will be tempted to move the bigger kids down to get an advantage. reply toast0 15 hours agorootparentAt least in USA Hockey, it's not too hard to get approval for kids to 'play up', our 12U team this year had 3 kids that were under age by one year. Getting approval to 'play down' is a lot harder. Our competitive league rules say (sorry for caps) \"HAVING 10U PLAYERS PLAYING UP AT 12U IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED, BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS TO DO SO. EACH ASSOCIATION AT THEIR DISCRETION MAY ALLOW UP TO TWO 10U PLAYERS PER SEASON TO PLAY UP AT THE 12U DIVISION.\" And further players are on a case by case basis, determined by a league coordinator from the opposite side of the state. USA Hockey rules don't permit playing down unless a doctor says it's medically necessary, but then they're not allowed to play on competitive teams. Simply being small or unskilled is specifically not an acceptable reason. [1] IMHO: playing up is pretty easy to administer, but playing down would be very hard to administer fairly for competitive teams, so it's just flat out prohibited. Edit for further thought: If you have enough participants, it might make sense to try running Jan 1 leagues and Jul 1 leagues and see if it makes sense to go to quarterly leagues too.

There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn't have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200/yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they'd be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.

It was discussing various forms of 'credit fine print' --- the ad for \"Buy this recliner today, no interest, no payments for three months!!!\" ... followed by five lines of fine print at the bottom of the ad (likely double the verbiage of this posting) about need to pay promptly, the upfront fees, etc etc, and the (somewhat usurious) rates and fees payable if the process wasn't followed to the letter. What makes it 'MCSLCP' is that for a large percentage of the population that would look at this, if you have the time / savvy to assess the deal and make it work, you probably have better credit options available. [1] It's super easy to comply with the terms if you have a personal organization system ('tickler') that works. Maintaining that system is really tough if you're a single parent/double job trying to keep the ship afloat... and also to have the funds to keep the deal working on the day that the tickler is triggered. But the 'MCS' of the MCSLCP is, just buy it with the cash-back credit card, and pay the balance in full before the due date. Easy percentage, and you already do that as part of the monthly bill-payment chore. For the vendor, the deal is a moneymaker since the majority of the takers will not (be able to) comply with the letter of the terms, and the fees and rates become the profit.

In some countries people think, taxes must be equal for all, or linearly grow (and with ideally smooth function). They even sometimes change mind and make experiment with other function. Many experts think, this is because in these countries, laws made entities tax agents (every entity pay all taxes for all hired people), so people just don't bother how many taxes they pay, and how much time spent to calculate all these things and to fill all papers. reply mbork_pl 15 hours agoparentprevSmooth - definitely not.

When I started my current job my salary was an integer multiple of $10,000. I got a raise at the end of my first year that was an integer percentage (3%, IIRC) so my salary was then an integer multiple of $100. The following year I got a raise again (it might have been an integer percentage, I don't recall) and my salary was just some random-looking integer. Rent-controlled Berkeley apartments are allowed to increase rent by some fixed percentage, so maybe you can see this in your data?

Remember how integrity of elections were questioned when a guy that is not our guy won an election in 2016? reply inglor_cz 1 hour agorootparentI am far from sure either, but Yeltsin had some \"street cred\" speaking for him. I remember the 1990s quite well, being a teenager with intense interest in politics. He got to power by organizing a folk uprising against an attempted coup by KGB generals Kryuchkov et al., who were hardliners and quite skilled people as well; they caught Gorbachev and held him hostage. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_attempt That coup could very well succeed and that would mean death for Yeltsin, possibly after a torture session in Lubyanka. He certainly demonstrated personal courage there. What followed was \"too free Russia\". As in, lawless. It had certain advantages. For the first time in Russian history ever, multiple independent media sprang from the ground and journalists would criticize and attack powerful figures in a way that they no longer can; we're used to it, but open media criticism of powerful people is actually not that typical in the world. But at the same time, crooks stole everything and the regular Russian suffered. As a nasty consequence, democracy and freedom became one with poverty and corruption in minds of many Russians. Yeltsin only contested one election, in 1996. His opponent Zyuganov was a classical communist. The result was 54.40% for Yeltsin and 40.73% for Zyuganov. Was this election clean? How can I know? But it wasn't a travesty with 90 per cent for The Leader and paper figures for \"opponents\"; Zyuganov was a real politician with a competing party and a very different program, and he got 40 per cent of the vote, and nobody fell out of the window etc. Everything is relative, and I believe that for the standards of Russia, Yeltsin was by far the most liberal leader in its history. reply rhelz 13 hours agoprev [–] If you are upset about somebody not wanting to take that $50k a year job because it would cost them a subsidy, just wait until you hear about trust funds and inheritance!!

    "originBody": "BY STEVEN LEVY BACKCHANNEL MAR 20, 2024 6:00 AM 8 Google Employees Invented Modern AI. Here’s the Inside Story They met by chance, got hooked on an idea, and wrote the “Transformers” paper—the most consequential tech breakthrough in recent history. ILLUSTRATION: MAGDA ANTONIUK EIGHT NAMES ARE listed as authors on “Attention Is All You Need,” a scientific paper written in the spring of 2017. They were all Google researchers, though by then one had left the company. When the most tenured contributor, Noam Shazeer, saw an early draft, he was surprised that his name appeared first, suggesting his contribution was paramount. “I wasn’t thinking about it,” he says. / NAME: NOAM SHAZEER / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER AND CEO OF CHARACTER AI It’s always a delicate balancing act to figure out how to list names—who gets the coveted lead position, who’s shunted to the rear. Especially in a case like this one, where each participant left a distinct mark in a true group effort. As the researchers hurried to finish their paper, they ultimately decided to “sabotage” the convention of ranking contributors. They added an asterisk to each name and a footnote: “Equal contributor,” it read. “Listing order is random.” The writers sent the paper off to a prestigious artificial intelligence conference just before the deadline—and kicked off a revolution. Approaching its seventh anniversary, the “Attention” paper has attained legendary status. The authors started with a thriving and improving technology—a variety of AI called neural networks—and made it into something else: a digital system so powerful that its output can feel like the product of an alien intelligence. Called transformers, this architecture is the not-so-secret sauce behind all those mind-blowing AI products, including ChatGPT and graphic generators such as Dall-E and Midjourney. Shazeer now jokes that if he knew how famous the paper would become, he “might have worried more about the author order.” All eight of the signers are now microcelebrities. “I have people asking me for selfies—because I’m on a paper!” says Llion Jones, who is (randomly, of course) name number five. / NAME: LLION JONES / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER OF SAKANA AI “Without transformers I don’t think we’d be here now,” says Geoffrey Hinton, who is not one of the authors but is perhaps the world’s most prominent AI scientist. He’s referring to the ground-shifting times we live in, as OpenAI and other companies build systems that rival and in some cases surpass human output. All eight authors have since left Google. Like millions of others, they are now working in some way with systems powered by what they created in 2017. I talked to the Transformer Eight to piece together the anatomy of a breakthrough, a gathering of human minds to create a machine that might well save the last word for itself. / NAME: JAKOB USZKOREIT / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER AND CEO OF INCEPTIVE THE STORY OF transformers begins with the fourth of the eight names: Jakob Uszkoreit. Uszkoreit is the son of Hans Uszkoreit, a well-known computational linguist. As a high school student in the late 1960s, Hans was imprisoned for 15 months in his native East Germany for protesting the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. After his release, he escaped to West Germany and studied computers and linguistics in Berlin. He made his way to the US and was working in an artificial intelligence lab at SRI, a research institute in Menlo Park, California, when Jakob was born. The family eventually returned to Germany, where Jakob went to university. He didn’t intend to focus on language, but as he was embarking on graduate studies, he took an internship at Google in its Mountain View office, where he landed in the company’s translation group. He was in the family business. He abandoned his PhD plans and, in 2012, decided to join a team at Google that was working on a system that could respond to users’ questions on the search page itself without diverting them to other websites. Apple had just announced Siri, a virtual assistant that promised to deliver one-shot answers in casual conversation, and the Google brass smelled a huge competitive threat: Siri could eat up their search traffic. They started paying a lot more attention to Uszkoreit’s new group. “It was a false panic,” Uszkoreit says. Siri never really threatened Google. But he welcomed the chance to dive into systems where computers could engage in a kind of dialog with us. At the time, recurrent neural networks—once an academic backwater—had suddenly started outperforming other methods of AI engineering. The networks consist of many layers, and information is passed and repassed through those layers to identify the best responses. Neural nets were racking up huge wins in fields such as image recognition, and an AI renaissance was suddenly underway. Google was frantically rearranging its workforce to adopt the techniques. The company wanted systems that could churn out humanlike responses—to auto-complete sentences in emails or create relatively simple customer service chatbots.

Recurrent neural networks struggled to parse longer chunks of text. Take a passage like Joe is a baseball player, and after a good breakfast he went to the park and got two hits. To make sense of “two hits,” a language model has to remember the part about baseball. In human terms, it has to be paying attention. The accepted fix was something called “long short-term memory” (LSTM), an innovation that allowed language models to process bigger and more complex sequences of text. But the computer still handled those sequences strictly sequentially—word by tedious word—and missed out on context clues that might appear later in a passage. “The methods we were applying were basically Band-Aids,” Uszkoreit says. “We could not get the right stuff to really work at scale.” Around 2014, he began to concoct a different approach that he referred to as self-attention. This kind of network can translate a word by referencing any other part of a passage. Those other parts can clarify a word’s intent and help the system produce a good translation. “It actually considers everything and gives you an efficient way of looking at many inputs at the same time and then taking something out in a pretty selective way,” he says. Though AI scientists are careful not to confuse the metaphor of neural networks with the way the biological brain actually works, Uszkoreit does seem to believe that self-attention is somewhat similar to the way humans process language. Uszkoreit thought a self-attention model could potentially be faster and more effective than recurrent neural nets. The way it handles information was also perfectly suited to the powerful parallel processing chips that were being produced en masse to support the machine learning boom. Instead of using a linear approach (look at every word in sequence), it takes a more parallel one (look at a bunch of them together). If done properly, Uszkoreit suspected, you could use self-attention exclusively to get better results. Not everyone thought this idea was going to rock the world, including Uszkoreit’s father, who had scooped up two Google Faculty research awards while his son was working for the company. “People raised their eyebrows, because it dumped out all the existing neural architectures,” Jakob Uszkoreit says. Say goodbye to recurrent neural nets? Heresy! “From dinner-table conversations I had with my dad, we weren’t necessarily seeing eye to eye.” Uszkoreit persuaded a few colleagues to conduct experiments on self-attention. Their work showed promise, and in 2016 they published a paper about it. Uszkoreit wanted to push their research further—the team’s experiments used only tiny bits of text—but none of his collaborators were interested. Instead, like gamblers who leave the casino with modest winnings, they went off to apply the lessons they had learned. “The thing worked,” he says. “The folks on that paper got excited about reaping the rewards and deploying it in a variety of different places at Google, including search and, eventually, ads. It was an amazing success in many ways, but I didn’t want to leave it there.” MOST POPULAR SCIENCE The Keys to a Long Life Are Sleep and a Better Diet—and Money MATT REYNOLDS BUSINESS Apple’s MM1 AI Model Shows a Sleeping Giant Is Waking Up WILL KNIGHT POLITICS Elon Musk's X Is Suspending Accounts That Reveal a Neo-Nazi Cartoonist's Alleged Identity DAVID GILBERT GEAR 21 Great Deals From Amazon’s Big Spring Sale LOURYN STRAMPE Uszkoreit felt that self-attention could take on much bigger tasks. There’s another way to do this, he’d argue to anyone who would listen, and some who wouldn’t, outlining his vision on whiteboards in Building 1945, named after its address on Charleston Road on the northern edge of the Google campus. / NAME: ILLIA POLOSUKHIN / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER OF NEAR One day in 2016, Uszkoreit was having lunch in a Google café with a scientist named Illia Polosukhin. Born in Ukraine, Polosukhin had been at Google for nearly three years. He was assigned to the team providing answers to direct questions posed in the search field. It wasn’t going all that well. “To answer something on Google.com, you need something that’s very cheap and high-performing,” Polosukhin says. “Because you have milliseconds” to respond. When Polosukhin aired his complaints, Uszkoreit had no problem coming up with a remedy. “He suggested, why not use self-attention?” says Polosukhin. Polosukhin sometimes collaborated with a colleague named Ashish Vaswani. Born in India and raised mostly in the Middle East, he had gone to the University of Southern California to earn his doctorate in the school’s elite machine translation group. Afterward, he moved to Mountain View to join Google—specifically a newish organization called Google Brain. He describes Brain as “a radical group” that believed “neural networks were going to advance human understanding.” But he was still looking for a big project to work on. His team worked in Building 1965 next door to Polosukhin’s language team in 1945, and he heard about the self-attention idea. Could that be the project? He agreed to work on it. / NAME: ASHISH VASWANI / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER AND CEO OF ESSENTIAL AI Together, the three researchers drew up a design document called “Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks.” They picked the name “transformers” from “day zero,” Uszkoreit says. The idea was that this mechanism would transform the information it took in, allowing the system to extract as much understanding as a human might—or at least give the illusion of that. Plus Uszkoreit had fond childhood memories of playing with the Hasbro action figures. “I had two little Transformer toys as a very young kid,” he says. The document ended with a cartoony image of six Transformers in mountainous terrain, zapping lasers at one another. There was also some swagger in the sentence that began the paper: “We are awesome.” In early 2017, Polosukhin left Google to start his own company. By then new collaborators were coming onboard. An Indian engineer named Niki Parmar had been working for an American software company in India when she moved to the US. She earned a master’s degree from USC in 2015 and was recruited by all the Big Tech companies. She chose Google. When she started, she joined up with Uszkoreit and worked on model variants to improve Google search. / NAME: NIKI PARMAR / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER OF ESSENTIAL AI Another new member was Llion Jones. Born and raised in Wales, he loved computers “because it was not normal.” At the University of Birmingham he took an AI course and got curious about neural networks, which were presented as a historical curiosity. He got his master’s in July 2009 and, unable to find a job during the recession, lived on the dole for months. He found a job at a local company and then applied to Google as a “hail Mary.” He got the gig and eventually landed in Google Research, where his manager was Polosukhin. One day, Jones heard about the concept of self-attention from a fellow worker named Mat Kelcey, and he later joined up with Team Transformers. (Later, Jones ran into Kelcey and briefed him on the transformer project. Kelcey wasn’t buying it. “I told him, ‘I’m not sure that’s going to work,’ which is basically the biggest incorrect prediction of my life,” Kelcey says now.) The transformer work drew in other Google Brain researchers who were also trying to improve large language models. This third wave included Łukasz Kaiser, a Polish-born theoretical computer scientist, and his intern, Aidan Gomez. Gomez had grown up in a small farming village in Ontario, Canada, where his family would tap maple trees every spring for syrup. As a junior at the University of Toronto, he “fell in love” with AI and joined the machine learning group—Geoffrey Hinton’s lab. He began contacting people at Google who had written interesting papers, with ideas for extending their work. Kaiser took the bait and invited him to intern. It wasn’t until months later that Gomez learned those internships were meant for doctoral students, not undergrads like him.

The answer was yes. The transformer crew set about building a self-attention model to translate text from one language to another. They measured its performance using a benchmark called BLEU, which compares a machine’s output to the work of a human translator. From the start, their new model did well. “We had gone from no proof of concept to having something that was at least on par with the best alternative approaches to LSTMs by that time,” Uszkoreit says. But compared to long short-term memory, “it wasn’t better.” They had reached a plateau—until one day in 2017, when Noam Shazeer heard about their project, by accident. Shazeer was a veteran Googler—he’d joined the company in 2000—and an in-house legend, starting with his work on the company’s early ad system. Shazeer had been working on deep learning for five years and recently had become interested in large language models. But these models were nowhere close to producing the fluid conversations that he believed were possible. As Shazeer recalls it, he was walking down a corridor in Building 1965 and passing Kaiser’s workspace. He found himself listening to a spirited conversation. “I remember Ashish was talking about the idea of using self-attention, and Niki was very excited about it. I’m like, wow, that sounds like a great idea. This looks like a fun, smart group of people doing something promising.” Shazeer found the existing recurrent neural networks “irritating” and thought: “Let’s go replace them!” Shazeer’s joining the group was critical. “These theoretical or intuitive mechanisms, like self-attention, always require very careful implementation, often by a small number of experienced ‘magicians,’ to even show any signs of life,” says Uszkoreit. Shazeer began to work his sorcery right away. He decided to write his own version of the transformer team’s code. “I took the basic idea and made the thing up myself,” he says. Occasionally he asked Kaiser questions, but mostly, he says, he “just acted on it for a while and came back and said, ‘Look, it works.’” Using what team members would later describe with words like “magic” and “alchemy” and “bells and whistles,” he had taken the system to a new level. “That kicked off a sprint,” says Gomez. They were motivated, and they also wanted to hit an upcoming deadline—May 19, the filing date for papers to be presented at the biggest AI event of the year, the Neural Information Processing Systems conference in December. As what passes for winter in Silicon Valley shifted to spring, the pace of the experiments picked up. They tested two models of transformers: one that was produced with 12 hours of training and a more powerful version called Big that was trained over three and a half days. They set them to work on English-to-German translation. The basic model outperformed all competitors—and Big earned a BLEU score that decisively shattered previous records while also being more computationally efficient. “We had done it in less time than anyone out there,” Parmar says. “And that was only the beginning, because the number kept improving.” When Uszkoreit heard this, he broke out an old bottle of champagne he had lying around in his mountain expedition truck.

Though officially some of the team still had desks in Building 1945, they mostly worked in 1965 because it had a better espresso machine in the micro-kitchen. “People weren’t sleeping,” says Gomez, who, as the intern, lived in a constant debugging frenzy and also produced the visualizations and diagrams for the paper. It’s common in such projects to do ablations—taking things out to see whether what remains is enough to get the job done. “There was every possible combination of tricks and modules—which one helps, which doesn’t help. Let’s rip it out. Let’s replace it with this,” Gomez says. “Why is the model behaving in this counterintuitive way? Oh, it’s because we didn’t remember to do the masking properly. Does it work yet? OK, move on to the next. All of these components of what we now call the transformer were the output of this extremely high-paced, iterative trial and error.” The ablations, aided by Shazeer’s implementations, produced “something minimalistic,” Jones says. “Noam is a wizard.” Vaswani recalls crashing on an office couch one night while the team was writing the paper. As he stared at the curtains that separated the couch from the rest of the room, he was struck by the pattern on the fabric, which looked to him like synapses and neurons. Gomez was there, and Vaswani told him that what they were working on would transcend machine translation. “Ultimately, like with the human brain, you need to unite all these modalities—speech, audio, vision—under a single architecture,” he says. “I had a strong hunch we were onto something more general.” In the higher echelons of Google, however, the work was seen as just another interesting AI project. I asked several of the transformers folks whether their bosses ever summoned them for updates on the project. Not so much. But “we understood that this was potentially quite a big deal,” says Uszkoreit. “And it caused us to actually obsess over one of the sentences in the paper toward the end, where we comment on future work.” That sentence anticipated what might come next—the application of transformer models to basically all forms of human expression. “We are excited about the future of attention-based models,” they wrote. “We plan to extend the transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text” and to investigate “images, audio and video.” A couple of nights before the deadline, Uszkoreit realized they needed a title. Jones noted that the team had landed on a radical rejection of the accepted best practices, most notably LSTMs, for one technique: attention. The Beatles, Jones recalled, had named a song “All You Need Is Love.” Why not call the paper “Attention Is All You Need”? The Beatles? “I’m British,” says Jones. “It literally took five seconds of thought. I didn’t think they would use it.” They continued collecting results from their experiments right up until the deadline. “The English-French numbers came, like, five minutes before we submitted the paper,” says Parmar. “I was sitting in the micro-kitchen in 1965, getting that last number in.” With barely two minutes to spare, they sent off the paper.

The reason was not to block others from using the ideas but to build up its patent portfolio for defensive purposes. (The company has a philosophy of “if technology advances, Google will reap the benefits.”) When the transformer crew heard back from the conference peer reviewers, the response was a mix. “One was positive, one was extremely positive, and one was, ‘This is OK,’” says Parmar. The paper was accepted for one of the evening poster sessions. By December, the paper was generating a buzz. Their four-hour session on December 6 was jammed with scientists wanting to know more. The authors talked until they were hoarse. By 10:30 pm, when the session closed, there was still a crowd. “Security had to tell us to leave,” says Uszkoreit. Perhaps the most satisfying moment for him was when computer scientist Sepp Hochreiter came up and praised the work—quite a compliment, considering that Hochreiter was the coinventor of long short-term memory, which transformers had just booted as the go-to hammer in the AI toolkit. TRANSFORMERS DID NOT instantly take over the world, or even Google. Kaiser recalls that around the time of the paper’s publication, Shazeer proposed to Google executives that the company abandon the entire search index and train a huge network with transformers—basically to transform how Google organizes information. At that point, even Kaiser considered the idea ridiculous. Now the conventional wisdom is that it’s a matter of time. A startup called OpenAI was much faster to pounce. Soon after the paper was published, OpenAI’s chief researcher, Ilya Sutskever—who had known the transformer team during his time at Google—suggested that one of its scientists, Alex Radford, work on the idea. The results were the first GPT products. As OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told me last year, “When the transformer paper came out, I don’t think anyone at Google realized what it meant.” The picture internally is more complicated. “It was pretty evident to us that transformers could do really magical things,” says Uszkoreit. “Now, you may ask the question, why wasn’t there ChatGPT by Google back in 2018? Realistically, we could have had GPT-3 or even 3.5 probably in 2019, maybe 2020. The big question isn’t, did they see it? The question is, why didn’t we do anything with the fact that we had seen it? The answer is tricky.” / NAME: AIDAN GOMEZ / OCCUPATION: COFOUNDER AND CEO OF COHERE Many tech critics point to Google’s transition from an innovation-centered playground to a bottom-line-focused bureaucracy. As Gomez told the Financial Times, “They weren’t modernizing. They weren’t adopting this tech.” But that would have taken a lot of daring for a giant company whose technology led the industry and reaped huge profits for decades. Google did begin to integrate transformers into products in 2018, starting with its translation tool. Also that year, it introduced a new transformer-based language model called BERT, which it started to apply to search the year after. But these under-the-hood changes seem timid compared to OpenAI’s quantum leap and Microsoft’s bold integration of transformer-based systems into its product line. When I asked CEO Sundar Pichai last year why his company wasn’t first to launch a large language model like ChatGPT, he argued that in this case Google found it advantageous to let others lead. “It’s not fully clear to me that it might have worked out as well. The fact is, we can do more after people had seen how it works,” he said.

Polosukhin’s company, Near, built a blockchain whose tokens have a market capitalization around $4 billion. Parmar and Vaswani paired up as business partners in 2021 to start Adept (estimated valuation of $1 billion) and are now on their second company, called Essential AI ($8 million in funding). Llion Jones’ Tokyo-based Sakana AI is valued at $200 million. Shazeer, who left in October 2021, cofounded Character AI (estimated valuation of $5 billion). Aidan Gomez, the intern in the group, cofounded Cohere in Toronto in 2019 (estimated valuation of $2.2 billion). Jakob Uszkoreit’s biotech company, Inceptive, is valued at $300 million. All those companies (except Near) are based on transformer technology. / NAME: LUKASZ KAISER / OCCUPATION: RESEARCHER AT OPENAI Kaiser is the only one who hasn’t founded a company. He joined OpenAI and is one of the inventors of a new technology called Q*, which Altman said last year will “push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward.” (When I attempted to quiz Kaiser on this in our interview, the OpenAI PR person almost leaped across the table to silence him.) Does Google miss these escapees? Of course, in addition to others who have migrated from the company to new AI startups. (Pichai reminded me, when I asked him about the transformer departures, that industry darling OpenAI also has seen defections: “The AI area is very, very dynamic,” he said.) But Google can boast that it created an environment that supported the pursuit of unconventional ideas. “In a lot of ways Google has been way ahead—they invested in the right minds and created the environment where we could explore and push the envelope,” Parmar says. “It’s not crazy that it took time to adopt it. Google had so much more at stake.” Without that environment: no transformer. Not only were the authors all Google employees, they also worked out of the same offices. Hallway encounters and overheard lunch conversations led to big moments. The group is also culturally diverse. Six of the eight authors were born outside the United States; the other two are children of two green-card-carrying Germans who were temporarily in California and a first-generation American whose family had fled persecution, respectively. Uszkoreit, speaking from his office in Berlin, says that innovation is all about the right conditions. “It’s getting people who are super excited about something who are at the right point in their life,” he says. “If you have that and have fun while you do it, and you’re working on the right problems—and you’re lucky—the magic happens.” Something magical also happened between Uszkoreit and his famous father. After all those dinner table debates, Hans Uszkoreit, his son reports, has now cofounded a company that is building large language models. Using transformers, of course.

Attention existed before those papers. What they did was show that it was enough to predict next word sequences in a certain context. I'm certain they didn't realize what they found. We used this frame work in 2018 and it gave us wildly unusual behavior (but really fun) and we tried to solve it (really looking for HF capability more than RL) but we didn't see what another group found: that scale in compute with simple algorithms were just better. To argue one group discovered and changed AI and ignore all the other groups is really annoying. I'm glad for these researchers. They deserve the accolade but they didn't invent modern AI. They advanced it. In an interesting way. But even now we want to return to a more deterministic approach. World models. Memory. Graph. Energy minimization. Generative is fun and it taught us something but I'm not sure we can just keep adding more and more chips to solve AGI/SGI through compute. Or maybe we can. But that paper is not written yet. reply a_wild_dandan 8 hours agoparentThis is an uncharitable and oddly dismissive take (i.e. perfect for HN, I suppose). Today's incredible state-of-the-art does not exist without the transformer architecture. Transformers aren't merely some lucky passengers riding the coattails of compute scale. If they were, then the ChatGPT app which set the world ablaze would've instead been called ChatMLP, or ChatCNN. But it's not. And in 2024 we still have no competing NLP architecture. Because the transformer is a genuinely profound, remarkable idea with remarkable properties (e.g. training parallelism). It's easy to downplay GPTs as a mostly derivative idea with the benefit of hindsight. I'm sure we'll perform the same revisionist history with state-space models, or whatever architecture eventually supplants transformers. Do GPTs build on prior work? Do other approaches and ideas deserve recognition? Yeah, obviously. Like...welcome to science. But the transformer's architects earned their praise -- including via this article -- which isn't some slight against everyone else, as if accolades were a zero-sum game.

A more accurate statement is that, on tasks where we don't actually understand how something works in precise detail, it's more effective to just throw compute at it until a system with \"innate\" understanding emerges.

This isn't the first time this piece has been posted before either. Here's one from FT last year[0] or Bloomberg[1]. You can find more. Google certainly played a major role, but it is too far to say they invented it or that they are the ones that created modern AI. Like Einstein said, shoulder of giants. And realistically, those giants are just a bunch of people in trench coats. Millions of researchers being unrecognized. I don't want to undermine the work of these researchers, but that doesn't mean we should also undermine the work of the many others (and thank god for the mathematicians who get no recognition and lay all the foundation for us). And of course, a triggered Yann[2] (who is absolutely right). But it is odd since it is actually a highly discussed topic, the history of attention. It's been discussed on HN many times before. And of course there's Lilian Weng's very famous blog post[3] that covers this in detail. The word attention goes back well over a decade and even before Schmidhuber's usage. He has a reasonable claim but these things are always fuzzy and not exactly clear. At least the article is more correct specifying Transformer rather than Attention, but even this is vague at best. FFormer (FFT-Transformer) was a early iteration and there were many variants. Do we call a transformer a residual attention mechanism with a residual feed forward? Can it be a convolution? There is no definitive definition but generally people mean DPMHA w/ skip layer + a processing network w/ skip layer. But this can be reflective of many architectures since every network can be decomposed into subnetworks. This even includes a 3 layer FFN (1 hidden layer). Stories are nice, but I think it is bad to forget all the people who are contribution in less obvious ways. If a butterfly can cause a typhoon, then even a poor paper can contribute to a revolution.

When I worked at Google I could bring up thousands of workers doing big tasks for hours without issue whenever I wanted, for me that was the same as being infinite since I never needed more, and that team didn't even have a particularly large budget. I can see a top ML team having enough compute budget to run a task on the entire Google scrape index dataset every day to test things, you don't need that much to do that, I wasn't that far from that. At that point the issue is no longer budget but time for these projects to run and return a result.

Right now web search is \"disruptive\" to the LLM business model. Google is a business fundamentally oriented around loss leaders. They make money on commercial queries where someone wants to buy something. They lose money when people search for facts or knowledge. The model works because people don't want to change their search engine every five minutes, so being good at the money losing queries means people will naturally use you for the money making queries too. Right now LLMs take all the money losing queries and spend vast sums of investor capital on serving them, but they are useless for queries like [pizza near me] or [medical injury legal advice] or [holidays in the canary islands]. So right now I'd expect actually Google to do quite well. Their competitor is burning capital taking away all the stuff that they don't really want, whilst leaving them with the gold. Now of course, that's today. The obvious direction for OpenAI to go in is finding ways to integrate ads with the free version of ChatGPT. But that's super hard. Building an ad network is hard. It takes a lot of time and effort, and it's really unclear what the product looks like there. Ads on web search is pretty obvious: the ads look like search results. What does an ad look like in a ChatGPT response? Google have plenty of time to figure this out because OpenAI don't seem interested. They've apparently decided that all of ChatGPT is a loss leader for their API services. Whether that's financially sustainable or not is unclear, but it's also irrelevant. People still want to do commercial queries, they still want things like real images and maps and yes even ads (the way the ad auction works on Google is a very good ranking signal for many businesses). ChatGPT is still useless for them, so for now they will continue to leave money on the table where Google can keep picking it up. reply crowcroft 13 hours agorootparentprevI know everyone cites this as the innovators dilemma, but so far the evidence suggests this isn't true. ChatGPT has been around for a while now, and it hasn't led to a collapse in Google's search revenue, and in fact now Google is rushing to roll out their version instead of trying to entrench search.

In America, getting a Green Card is very difficult and costly, and depending on your national origin can be almost impossible. In Japan, there's no limits at all, per year or per country of origin, for work visas or PR.

Companies like Sony or Canon did better because they were in the business of consumer electronics / hardware already. Building an amazing digital sensor and some good optics is great, but if you can't write the firmware or make the PCB yourself, you're going to have a hard time competing. It's not chemical-wing vs digital-wing. It's that Kodak wasn't (and rightly wasn't) a computing hardware manufacturer, which makes it pretty damned hard to compete in making computing devices.

It seems to me that Vision-capable multi-modal transformers could be the missing part: they can understand what is happening in the world in a deductive way. The Vision transformer is capable of predicting that a running child is likely to follow that rolling soccer ball. It is capable of deducting that a particular situation looks dangerous or unusual and it should slow down, or stay away from danger in ways that previous crop of AI could not. Imo, the only thing currently preventing transformers to change everything is the large amount of compute power required to run them. It's not currently possible to imagine GPT4-V running on a embedded computer inside a car. Maybe AI asic type of chip will solve that issue, maybe Edge computing and 5G will find it's use-case...

You need an AI model that has good behaviors in the edge cases. For the most part it won't matter how good the vision models get, you're going to need similar models that can make the same predictions from LIDAR signals because the technology needs to work when the vision model goes crazy because of the reflectivity of a surface or other such edge cases where it completely misunderstands where the object is. reply lelag 16 hours agorootparentI don't quite agree on this one. While I think that Musk choices to go full vision when he did was foulish because he made his product worse, his main point is not wrong: human do drive well while using mostly vision. Assuming you can replicate the thought process of human driver using AI, I don't see why you could not create a self-driving car using only vision. That's also where I would see transformers or another AI architecture with reasoning capabilities shine: the fact that it can reason about what is about to happen would allow it to handle edge cases much better than relying on dumb sensors. As a human, it would be very difficult to drive a car just looking at sensor data. The only vehicule I can think of where we do that is submarines. Sensors data is good for classical AI but I don't think it will handle edge case well. To be a reasonable self-driving system, it should be able to decide to slow down and maintain a reasonable safety space because it is judging the car in front to be driving erratically (ex: due to driver impairement). Only an AI that can reason about what is going on can do that. reply EForEndeavour 16 hours agorootparent> As a human, it would be very difficult to drive a car just looking at sensor data.

More seriously, for safety critical applications, LLM have some serious limitations (most obviously hallucinations). Still, I beleive they could work in automotive application assuming: high quality of the output (better than current SoA) and very high token count (hundreds or even thousand of token/s and more), allowing to bruteforce the problem and run many inferences per seconds. Clearly we are not there yet. reply cjbprime 15 hours agorootparentCould combine the existing real-time driving model with influence from the LLM, as an improvement to allow understanding of unusual situations, or as a cross-check? I wasn't intending to say it would be useful today, but pushing back against what I understood to be an argument that, once we do have a model we'd trust, it won't be possible to run it in-car. I think it absolutely would be.

Consider \"modern\" to mean NN/connectionist vs GOFAI AI attempts like CYC or SOAR. I guess it depends on how you define \"AI\", and whether you accept the media's labelling of anything ML-related as AI. To me, LLMs are the first thing deserving to be called AI, and other NNs like CNNs better just called ML since there is no intelligence there. reply nostrademons 17 hours agorootparentBut that's been the case for the last 60 years. Whatever came out in the last 10 years is the first thing deserving to be called AI, and everything else is just basic computer science algorithms that every practitioner should know. Eliza was AI in 1967; now it's just string substitution. Prolog was AI in 1972; now it's logic programming. Beam search and A* were AI in the 1970s; now they're just search algorithms. Expert systems were AI in the 1980s; now they're just rules engines. Handwriting recognition, voice recognition, and speech synthesis were AI in the 90s; now they're just multilayer perceptrons aka artificial neural nets. SVMs were AI in the 00s; now they're just support vector machines. CNNs and LSTMs were AI in the 10s; now they're just CNNs and LSTMs. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect reply HarHarVeryFunny 16 hours agorootparentYeah, but for a while it seemed we'd gotten over that, and in the \"modern era\" people were just talking about ML. Nobody in 2012, as best I can recall, was referring to AlexNet as \"AI\", but then (when did it start?) at some point the media started calling everything AI, and eventually the ML community capitulated and started calling it that too - maybe because the VC's wanted to invest in sexy AI, not ML. reply golol 16 hours agorootparentprev> Consider \"modern\" to mean NN/connectionist vs GOFAI AI attempts like CYC or SOAR. Well this is what Im trying to say too! reply mindcrime 16 hours agorootparentprevConsider \"modern\" to mean NN/connectionist vs GOFAI AI attempts like CYC or SOAR. I dunno. The earliest research into what we now call \"neural networks\" dates back to at least the 1950's (Frank Rosenblatt and the Perceptron) and arguably into the 1940's (Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts and the TLU \"neuron\"). And depending on how generous one is with their interpretation of certain things, arguments have been made that the history of neural network research dates back to before the invention of the digital computer altogether, or even before electrical power was ubiquitous (eg, late 1800's). Regarding the latter bit, I believe it was Jurgen Schmidhuber who advanced that argument in an interview I saw a while back and as best as I can recall, he was referring to a certain line of mathematical research from that era. In the end, defining \"modern\" is probably not something we're ever going to reach consensus on, but I really think your proposal misses the mark by a small touch. reply HarHarVeryFunny 8 hours agorootparentSure, the history of NNs goes back a while, but nobody was attempting to build AI out of perceptrons (single layer), which were famously criticized as not being able to even implement an XOR function. The modern era of NNs started with being able to train multilayer neural nets using backprop, but the ability to train NNs large enough to actually be useful for complex things AI research, can arguably be dated to the 2012 Imagenet competition when Geoff Hinton's team repurposed GPUs to train AlexNet. But, AlexNet was just a CNN, a classifier, which IMO is better just considered as ML, not AI, so if we're looking for the first AI in this post-GOFAI world of NN-based experimentation, then it seems we have to give the nod to transformer-based LLMs. reply cjbprime 18 hours agorootparentprev> It's just not true that everything not transformer is outdated.

Realistically, we could have had GPT-3 or even 3.5 probably in 2019, maybe 2020. The big question isn’t, did they see it? The question is, why didn’t we do anything with the fact that we had seen it?

They weren’t adopting this tech.” reply HarHarVeryFunny 18 hours agorootparent> There's also an entire section narrating how google execs passed on transformers and didn't pick up until OpenAI released GPT. Google certainly seem to have fumbled on rapidly exploiting the tech, but I'm not sure that's totally fair. Google built BERT in 2018, around the same time as OpenAI built GPT-1, but neither were released. OpenAI's GPT-2 was built in february 2019 but OpenAI were hesitant to release it due to potential danger, only doing so later in november 2019. GPT-3 followed in july 2020, but ChatGPT which the first accessible to public view of the tech didn't appear until november 2022 (how time flies!). Google's first transformer-based chatbot, LaMDA, was released in may 2021, well over a year before ChatGPT, but was then rapidly withdrawn due to negative feedback and behavior. The difference between ChatGPT's acceptable behavior, and success, compared to LaMBDA, was OpenAI's invention of RLHF to better control it.

Truthfully the program they have looks fantastic at empowering UI/UX designers to do more with games. I'm not sure if everyone is aware, but the normal flow is that a UI/UX designer will spend days in Figma; give the output to a programmer and the programmer will (often) say that it's impossible to implement for X,Y reason. What follows is a back and forth between the programmer and the designer until eventually a design exists that can be implemented. This is compounded by the fact that there's no good UI framework in Unreal engine, at least not for AAA games. So, while I have not done a feasibility test yet, the workflow of this tool is definitely the best I've seen and seems to integrate seamlessly with Unreal Engine and blueprints. I'm personally really excited, because with this it's possible for a UI/UX designer to work without the aid of a programmer. (also, game programmers tend to hate doing UI). reply zengid 18 hours agoprevThere's a lot of active research around rendering 2-d vector graphics with GPU tessellation (Raph Levien's work for instance), so this is pretty cool that they're shipping a product with this technique. I've never used Rive so I'm wondering if its strictly for making cool animations or if it can be used for building dynamic UI's (the kind that you might use an immediate mode gui lib for)? reply neurowave 17 hours agoparentWe have customers shipping full UI with Rive!

With the Rive renderer open-sourced, maybe both Rive and Godot will see an integration using the Rive renderer? reply toddmorey 15 hours agoparentprevOne of the things that makes Rive great for dynamic UI components is the excellent state machine deeply supported by the editor: https://help.rive.app/editor/state-machine While I've built some fairly complex UI with Rive, one area I haven't explored is programmatically adding elements or say changing UI text based on external events. reply toddmorey 15 hours agoprevSo I love Rive—the product and the company. And I love open source. But this is an MIT license for Rive's rendering abstraction layer, a subset of the Rive runtime that requires the Rive Editor to build content for. I'm just curious about the goals for open sourcing this and what your hope and plan is for the larger community you'd like to build around it. Can you think of perhaps another project that would benefit from adopting just the renderer? Thanks! reply lukan 12 hours agoparent\"I'm just curious about the goals for open sourcing this\" I suppose, continue to make money with the proprietary editor, but have an open source renderer to deploy and enable an ecosystem, where other people target this renderer, as it might be superior.

Previously they used Skia and their entire app is (and rendering output was) built with Flutter. Now Flutter has a new rendering engine via Impeller which is more optimized than Skia for Flutter specific challenges. When I asked the Impeller team before what they thought of the Rive renderer, they said that it is great for vector graphics but Impeller needs to also deal with all of the UI related rendering challenges like displaying text properly, so they're not a one to one comparison. Hopefully with this renderer being open source now, both teams can learn from each other. reply Zamiel_Snawley 16 hours agoparentCorrect me if I’m wrong, but aren’t fonts rendered from vector graphics already? TTF and OTF are vector formats, correct? reply Aurornis 15 hours agorootparentFonts begin as vector graphics, but every single character on your screen isn't rendered as a tiny, individual vector graphic. Text rendering libraries use a lot of optimizations to cache rasterized glyphs because they're reused all over your screen. It also gets extraordinarily complex when you have to handle text layout, kerning, languages that read in different directions, styles, and all of the other complications that come with font rendering. TrueType fonts even support a small virtual machine to process tiny code programs related to font rendering.

Performance optimizations mentioned in the other comments is not the sole reason. Another one is visual quality. Direct rendering of these vector glyphs would look good on high DPI displays and/or for very large font sizes. For normal-looking text on typical displays you won’t achieve great results without hinting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_hinting Another quality related problem is subpixel rendering https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering Just like hinting, hard to solve while directly rendering vector shapes. reply zogrodea 17 hours agoprevThis looks extremely cool and I'm excited to use it in my own personal hobby projects. It looks like the somewhat standardised Cairo/Skia/canvas/NanoVG API (moveTo, lineTo, etc.) is provided so should hopefully take not much effort to learn, I'm hoping. (I do see lineTo here at the very least. https://github.com/rive-app/rive-renderer/blob/main/renderer... ) reply zozbot234 17 hours agoprevHow does the rendering performance of this compare to something like Skia or Pathfinder? Note that the latter can also optionally do the paths-to-triangles conversion step using GPU compute, if the hardware supports that. There's also Vello for a more comprehensive compute-based approach to 2D rendering. reply raphlinus 16 hours agoparentI'm looking forward to doing careful benchmarking, as this renderer absolutely looks like it will be competitive. It turns out that is really hard to do, if you want meaningful results. My initial take is that performance will be pretty dependent on hardware, in particular support for pixel local storage[1]. From what I've seen so far, Apple Silicon is the sweet spot, as there is hardware support for binning and sorting to tiles, and then asking for fragment shader execution to be serialized within a tile works well. On other hardware, I expect the cost of serializing those invocations to be much higher. One reason we haven't done deep benchmarking on the Vello side is that our performance story is far from done. We know one current issue is the use of device atomics for aggregating bounding boxes. We have a prototype implementation [2] that uses monoids for segmented reduction, and that looks like a nice improvement. Additionally, we plan to do f16 math (which should be a major win especially on mobile), as well as using subgroups for various prefix sum steps (subgroups are in the process of landing in WebGPU[3]). Overall, I'm thrilled to see this released as open source, and that there's so much activity in fast GPU vector graphics rendering. I'd love to see a future in which CPU path rendering is seen as being behind the times, and this moves us closer to that future. [1]: https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn/+/refs/heads/main/docs/da...

I'm not super familiar with Vello. These are solid tech choices by people who know what they're doing... definitely worth the effort to check its performance and quality out for yourself. These GPU-first renderers all have slightly different approaches and each probably occupies a best-in-class niche for some multidimensional space of quality x performance x hardware/driver support x ease of integration. If you're not happy with one of the four, the others are all worth checking out. reply ignoramous 43 minutes agorootparent> I'm pretty confident this will at very least compete with both Skia and Pathfinder Couldn't Vello be embed / used by Skia, Cairo et al, if those renderers wanted to use GPU Compute instead of CPU's for preprocessing? reply neurowave 17 hours agoparentprevWe need to do some newer benchmarking, the Rive Renderer has gotten faster since these initial tests: https://twitter.com/guidorosso/status/1595187838454140928 reply emmanueloga_ 17 hours agorootparentCan you talk a bit about text rendering? How does it compare to slug? [1] Would it be suitable for rendering text heavy applications? (like, say, a PDF viewer, a code editor, web browser, etc). -- 1: https://sluglibrary.com/ reply csmartdalton 16 hours agorootparentThe Rive renderer takes an animation-first approach to all path rendering, including text. Meaning, every glyph is redrawn from raw bezier curves with full precision antialiasing, every frame. (Just like any other path.) This optimizes the smoothness of animation, is fast enough to render fullscreen pages on top of pages of high dpi text at 120fps (on a decent GPU), and the antialiasing quality is always full precision in the (0..255) color channels. If you want more niche text-specific features like hinting and clear text, those aren’t supported because they don’t animate smoothly and/or don’t work as well with colors other than black and white. I recommend trying all the options for your specific needs and finding what works best! reply tehsauce 17 hours agoparentprevAt least one of their runtime implementations I checked out was implemented on top of Skia. Looks like they support a number of possible backends! reply cojo 15 hours agoprevThis is really exciting to see for me personally. I've been pushing over the past six months or so for multiple clients, from healthcare companies with basic mobile apps to deep gaming companies / products, to adopt Rive over Lottie and other past solutions, as I think it's finally hit its stride and is \"ready-for-adoption\". This was the last piece that came up in some of those discussions as a potential concern (latest renderer being \"closed source\" / not quite final). Really excited to see this problem space continue to improve thanks to this decision and the work the Rive team is doing in general (drop shadows, blur, etc. are all going to be very exciting as they ship)! reply rrampage 19 hours agoprevRepo: https://github.com/rive-app/rive-renderer reply mdaniel 16 hours agoparent> https://github.com/rive-app/rive-renderer#install-premake5 heh, relevant: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39754770 (Build System Schism: The Curse of Meta Build Systems) reply devit 13 hours agoprevThis problem seems to create a continuous stream of software attempting to solve it with no definitive solution. It's kind of strange, because there is a single objectively correct rendering for any vector graphics scene given a pixel sampling function and colorspace metric (the one where each output pixel's value is the closest representable color to the convolution of that function with the scene, expressed as a function from R^2 to R and a linear color scheme respectively), and it seems like it would be achievable with GPU compute and some care with error bounds on either curve tessellation or numerical computation of the exact symbolic integrals of curves. And it also seems easy to make such a solution have a tunable level of approximation to have faster rendering. reply raphlinus 12 hours agoparentI think you've got a point here. 2D rendering is reasonably well defined. The problem is the overwhelming complexity of the GPU ecosystem. If you just had a decent parallel computer, it wouldn't be so hard. But instead you have to adapt your rendering logic to the particular combination of pile of hacks your GPU infrastructure supports, each having an exquisitely unique set of limitations and tradeoffs. You'll likely enjoy our upcoming GPU-friendly stroke expansion paper - the core of it is exactly numerical methods with error bounds for the exact symbolic integrals of (certain curvature metrics) of curves.

This method allows for scalable vector assets to be rasterized on-demand, even at high resolutions like retina, maintaining quality comparable to the browser's rasterizer. Third-party libraries didn't offer consistent or satisfactory results. reply mfabbri77 16 hours agoprevIs there technical documentation to understand the method behind the engine? because at first sight it seems like the classic \"path flattening to polygon and then triangulation\" that has been used for 20+ years (at Mazatech our first AmanithVG on OpenGL used that technique) but I'm sure there is more than that on Rive renderer ...to be recognized as a such powerful engine. reply GlacierFox 16 hours agoprevSo does this mean someome can create a free editor I can use for basic animation that I don't have to pay $25 for the rest of my life to use?

Wtf haha, anyone actually paying this for basic solo-dev work? Out of curiosity, how much do you expect to make for your basic solo-dev work? Very often I find that devs' attitude when it comes to their own work is \"I deserve a six figure salary/equivalent sales\" but when it comes to other people's work, that flips to \"software should be free\". I have zero idea where the salaries are supposed to come from then. reply BoorishBears 15 hours agoparentprevWe've really been spoiled by modern software competition. Once upon a time middleware like this would have been \"Call Us\" with a custom 5 figure license and royalties. Now it's not even an hour of a single developer's time cost per month and you get complaints. reply toddmorey 15 hours agorootparentRight? Also one \"hack\" I use quite a bit is to subscribe for when I need a tool and then unsubscribe when I don't. I use privacy.com to create virtual credit cards that can only be charged once, or a certain amount, or for a certain period of time. Of course you'll need to backup your data, but honestly that's good practice anyway. I just search Google to ensure the service makes it easy to unsubscribe and easy to export your data. Many projects have phases where you use certain tools extensively—no sense in continuing to pay for say an online video editor on the months you aren't, well, editing any video. reply jokethrowaway 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's the market distortion created by people who work for free and expect to get stuff for free It seems like OSS is more and more bigcorp making money anyway so probably that perception will keep shifting until we're back to normal conditions and OSS developers will be able to earn a salary from their work. reply toddmorey 15 hours agoparentprevIt seems to be just the very basement level of an open source Rive-type project. You would need to build the runtime around this renderer and then of course the authoring app. It would still be quite a lift, but hey, success does start with high-performance vectors. More likely, I see perhaps other projects with vector-rendering needs (in-game UIs, video creation tools, svg tools, etc) perhaps studying or adopting the render to make their own graphics more performant. But to answer your question on \"who pays for this?\" I can raise my hand and say \"I do!\" and it's a great value. But just like Copilot probably isn't the best monthly investment if you're not doing quite a bit of coding, Rive probably isn't the best investment if you aren't doing quite a bit of animation. reply javajosh 18 hours agoprevDidn't we already do this experiment with Flash? Macromedia/Adobe made the player free, and charged for tools. In the same way, it seems that Rive wants to open source the player and then charge for the editor. Maybe its a bit different since Rive seems targeted at game devs using other platforms like Unity and Unreal - presumably to embed things like cinematics? But then of course you have this (OSS) player, which implies Rive also wants to own the whole experience. Hence the reference to Flash.

The animation of the walking bird is 246kB MP4. Bigger than Rive, sure, but it essentially takes no heap or runtime, which is at least 195kB of WASM. The walking bird animation could probably be optimized much further through automatic decisions that the encoders can take. You shouldn't use either Lottie or Rive for static animations. reply lukan 3 hours agorootparent\"You shouldn't use either Lottie or Rive for static animations.\" I guess that depends on your use case. If you only have this animation on your website, then probably no. But if you load and run the rive engine anyway, because you build a game with it - then why not also use it for \"static animations\", if the result can be way sharper? reply GlacierFox 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat's a static animation? reply corysama 15 hours agorootparentI'm gonna guess they mean an animation that's the same every time you play it. reply jokethrowaway 13 hours agorootparentprevProbably he/she meant just a video file (as opposed to computing the vectors at runtime) reply filleduchaos 13 hours agorootparentprev> The animation of the walking bird is 246kB MP4. I mean, that fundamentally misses the point of vector graphics, no? I could also argue that a screenshot of a rendered SVG icon takes no heap or runtime, which would also completely miss the point of why a designer would want vector icons. JPGs and MP4s alike are not infinitely scalable. reply doctorpangloss 9 hours agorootparentYeah, that’s correct. SVG is not a good delivery format, I agree. It is an excellent intermediate format, like a ProRes encoded video is. It’s tough. We’re chatting on a website with no graphics besides a low resolution letter Y logo.

Often the perception that paper is a better support is due to a lack of more convenient devices. Paper is better than a 15'' screen for sure, for many reasons including size and posture while reading. But have you tried larger screens (> 27''), large tablets (>= A4) or as large as possible E-Ink readers? Depending on your preferences, you might find that some of these work actually better than paper also for you :-) reply ykonstant 25 minutes agorootparentThere is no way I can perceive reading on an expensive device as more comfortable than paper. Paper is fairly cheap, lightweight and resilient; I can carry it around, fold it, toss it aside, sit on it by accident while thinking, annotate it with scribbles, and pour coffee on it with aplomb and finesse. I can flip it, half-tear it in anger, drool on it when I reach my brain capacity. I can take it hiking with me without fear of breaking or losing it. In other words, paper is a tool that gets out of my way. I did try all the devices you listed above, even had my department pay serious money, and ended up barely using them for all those reasons.

By Pouring Billions Into Public Housing One quarter of residents in the French capital live in government-owned housing, part of an aggressive plan to keep lower-income Parisians — and their businesses — in the city. Share full article 494 Even on a gray winter’s day, the Eiffel Tower stands out from the balcony of the new Îlot Saint-Germain public housing development in the Seventh arrondissement. The apartment’s resident, Marine Vallery-Radot, is among hundreds of thousands of Parisians living in public housing. Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times By Thomas Fuller Thomas Fuller, a former European Union and Paris correspondent, returned to the French capital to interview public housing tenants and officials from Paris City Hall. Published March 17, 2024 Updated March 19, 2024 The two-bedroom penthouse comes with sweeping views of the Eiffel Tower and just about every other monument across the Paris skyline. The rent, at 600 euros a month, is a steal. Marine Vallery-Radot, 51, the apartment’s tenant, said she cried when she got the call last summer that hers was among 253 lower-income families chosen for a spot in the l’Îlot Saint-Germain, a new public-housing complex a short walk from the Musée d’Orsay, the National Assembly and Napoleon’s tomb. “We were very lucky to get this place,” said Ms. Vallery-Radot, a single mother who lives here with her 12-year-old son, as she gazed out of bedroom windows overlooking the Latin Quarter. “This is what I see when I wake up.” Image The Îlot Saint-Germain public housing complex includes a below-ground gymnasium and a day care center. The complex was built in the former offices of the French Defense Ministry. Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times Public housing can conjure images of bleak, boxy towers on the outskirts of a city, but this logement social was built in the former offices of the French Defense Ministry, in the Seventh arrondissement, one of Paris’s most chic neighborhoods. It’s part of an ambitious and aggressive effort to keep middle- and lower-income residents and small-business owners in the heart of a city that would otherwise be unaffordable to them — and by extension, to preserve the ineffable character of a city adored by people around the globe. This summer, when the French capital welcomes upward of 15 million visitors for the Olympic Games, it will showcase a city engineered by government policies to achieve mixité sociale — residents from a broad cross-section of society. One quarter of all Paris residents now live in public housing, up from 13 percent in the late 1990s. The mixité sociale policy, promoted most forcefully by left-wing political parties, notably the French Communist Party, targets the economic segregation seen in many world cities. “Our guiding philosophy is that those who produce the riches of the city must have the right to live in it,” said Ian Brossat, a communist senator who served for a decade as City Hall’s head of housing. Teachers, sanitation workers, nurses, college students, bakers and butchers are among those who benefit from the program. Making the philosophy a reality is increasingly hard — the wait list for public housing in Paris is more than six years long. “I won’t say this is easy and that we have solved the problem,” Mr. Brossat said. Image “Our guiding philosophy is that those who produce the riches of the city must have the right to live in it,” said Ian Brossat, a senator who served for a decade as Paris City Hall’s head of housing. Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times Paris is being buffeted by the same market forces vexing other so-called superstar cities like London, San Francisco and New York — a sanctum for the world’s wealthiest to park their money and buy a piece of a living museum. The average price for a 1,000-square-foot apartment in the center of the capital today is 1.3 million euros (about $1.41 million), according to the Chamber of Notaries of Paris. The Fondation Abbé Pierre, an influential charity, was unusually emphatic in its annual report, published in February, calling France’s affordability crisis a “social bomb,” with rising homelessness and 2.4 million families waiting on public-housing applications, up from 2 million in 2017. Still, the measures that Paris has taken to keep lower-income residents in the city go far beyond the initiatives in most other European cities, not to mention American ones. Every Thursday, Jacques Baudrier, the Paris city councilor in charge of housing, scrolls through the list of properties being exchanged by sellers and buyers on the private market. With some exceptions, the city has the legal right to pre-empt the sale of a building, buy the property and convert it to public housing. “We are in a constant battle,” said Mr. Baudrier, who wields a 625 million euro annual budget. The fight, he said, is against forces that make buying Parisian real estate impossible for all but the well-to-do, including buyers who snap up apartments as pieds-à-terre and then leave them empty for most of the year. Paris has also sharply restricted short-term rentals, after officials became alarmed when historic neighborhoods, including the old Jewish quarter, the Marais, appeared to be shedding full-time residents as investors bought places to rent out to tourists. Image The city converted a police barracks built during the French Revolution into 70 public housing units. The building is steps away from the Place des Vosges in the Marais. Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times At the same time, the city has built or renovated more than 82,000 apartments over the past three decades for families with children. Rents range from six to 13 euros per square meter, depending on household income, meaning that a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot apartment might go for as little as 600 euros ($650) a month. It has also built 14,000 student apartments over the past 25 years; monthly rents at one complex currently nearing completion in the 13th arrondissement start at 250 euros a month. For City Hall, social engineering also means protecting the petits commerces, the small shops that contribute to the city’s sense of timelessness. When visitors here meander through what seems like a series of small villages, with boulangeries, cheese shops, cobblers and mom-and-pop hardware stores, it is not entirely organic. City Hall has a direct hand in the types of businesses that take root and survive in Paris because it is the landlord, through its real estate subsidiaries, of 19 percent of the city’s shops. Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, the city counselor who oversees the city’s commercial landholdings, said his office is constantly studying neighborhoods to maintain a balance of essential shops and limit the number of chains, which can usually pay higher rent. “We don’t rent to McDonald’s, we don’t rent to Burger King and we don’t rent to Sephora,” said Mr. Bonnet-Oulaldj. He acknowledged that in some neighborhoods where private landlords have rented to chains the battle has been plainly lost. The city is deliberate in what shops it chooses. In an area that had become thick with hairdressing salons, City Hall rented to a boulangerie and a cheese shop. In other neighborhoods it has chosen to rent to bicycle repair shops, in part to reinforce the city’s push to reduce the number of cars in favor of bikes. It doesn’t rent to massage parlors on the grounds that they are sometimes fronts for prostitution. Image Nicolas Bonnet-Oulaldj, right, the city counselor who oversees Paris’s commercial landholdings, refuses to rent city-owned retail space to chain restaurants. Instead, he is promoting bistros like Le Mesturet, owned by Alain Fontaine, left, who called traditional bistros “a social necessity.” Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times A few minutes from the Place de la Bastille is one of the beneficiaries of the city’s retail policies. Emmanuelle Fayat, a luthier who restores and services violins for orchestra musicians, sits surrounded by maple and spruce and the tools of her trade: neatly organized rasps, planes and chisels. She rents her shop for “a modest amount” from a city-owned real estate management company. “I have no knowledge of marketing and I’ve never asked myself how to become rich,” Ms. Fayat said on a recent afternoon. “I just want to do my job. I like my profession more than money.” About a mile away, in a neighborhood rich with cafes and restaurants, Librairie Violette and Co, a feminist and lesbian bookshop, is another beneficiary of Paris’s retail diversity program. When the bookshop’s previous location was bought by an insurance company and the original owners retired, a group of women that wanted to keep the business going struggled to find a new home and announced they were closing the store. City officials reached out and offered a new space at below-market rates. “Banks refused to lend us money,” said Loïse Tachon, a co-manager of the shop. “They didn’t think it would be lucrative enough.” Further north, near the Buttes-Chaumont park, the city rents a storefront to Desirée Fleurs, which specializes in flowers grown in the Paris region. Audrey Venant, the co-founder of the shop, sees the program as a necessary and protective guiding hand. Image Emmanuelle Fayat, a luthier, rents her shop near the Place de la Bastille for a modest rate from a city-owned real estate management company. Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times “Local businesses are very, very fragile,” she said, surrounded by narcissus, ranunculus, snapdragon, all perfumed by eucalyptus. “I see a lot of bankruptcies.” Ms. Venant and her husband, a painter and sculptor, live in a 750-square-foot loft that is also part of the city’s public-housing program. Her monthly 1,300-euro rent is well below market rates, she said. The French statistics agency, Insee, reports that Paris is home to more than 10,000 nurses, 1,700 bakers, 470 butchers, 945 garbage collectors and 5,300 janitors. The push for more social housing and other programs to make the city more affordable has coincided with the dominance of left-wing political parties, who came to power in 2001 after decades of right-wing rule. But François Rochon, an urban planning consultant, said there is a functional consensus between right and left in France today on the need for public housing that mirrors some other European nations, but not the United States. “Living in social housing is not stigmatized,” said Mr. Rochon, who pointed to its roots a century ago in France, when companies built apartments for their workers. As a measure of the left-right alignment on the issue, Benoist Apparu, a former housing minister who served in a conservative government, described social housing as “absolutely essential.” Image Librairie Violette and Co, a feminist and lesbian bookshop, rents a city-owned storefront and attracts a clientele from across France. Credit... Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times “A city, if it’s only made up of poor people, is a disaster,” said Mr. Apparu, who now works for a property developer. “And if it’s only made up of rich people, it’s not much better.” Paris’s housing program is part of the trade-off of the welfare state: affordable health care and education in exchange for some of the highest income-tax rates and social charges in Europe. Public housing, however, is increasingly available only for those lucky enough to get it. There also is vestigial cynicism in Paris about public housing after a series of scandals in the 1990s, when some conservative politicians were revealed to be paying cheap rents for luxury city-owned apartments. Today, the city awards public housing through a system that strips the names of applicants and prioritizes them through a points system that factors income and family circumstances. Mostly, resistance comes at the local level, Mr. Rochon said. Residents in central arrondissements, for example, have often pushed back against building public housing, and the neighborhoods remain bastions of the wealthy. There is also disagreement about how far the government can or should push public housing in the future. The current goal is for Paris to have 30 percent public housing for low-income residents and 10 percent for middle-income residents by 2035. Mr. Baudrier, the Paris City Council member, said he believes that in the long term, 60 percent of housing in the city should be public and reserved for low- and middle-income families. But building new public housing has been particularly challenging because so much of the city is already so densely packed — and often protected by landmark status.

Alex Cretey-Systermans for The New York Times City planners have negotiated with the public railways to buy old train yards and rights of way. They’ve also seized on opportunities like the one that arose in 2018, when the French Defense Ministry consolidated its offices in Paris and the city negotiated to buy the l’Îlot Saint-Germain for well below market rates. The ensuing construction of 253 apartments was financed by the sale of part of the building to a Qatari investment fund, which is building a luxury hotel, as well as low-interest government loans that have durations as long as 50 to 80 years, according to Emmanuelle Cosse, a former housing minister. City Hall has also taken over condemned buildings. Fabrice Chaillou, a father of two who manages computer networks, lives in public housing on the northern edge of Paris that was built from the ruins of a dilapidated neighborhood. He pays 980 euros a month for a three-bedroom apartment that he waited 10 years to get. Among his neighbors are a janitor, teachers, a car salesman and a police officer. The program has allowed Mr. Chaillou and his wife to raise their two children in the city. But he knows that the future of social housing will always face at least one big challenge: “The problem is that once you get in, you never want to leave.” Thomas Fuller, a Page One Correspondent for The Times, writes and rewrites stories for the front page.

In general, public housing sits on the outer edges of Paris, but the city has been agressive in reconverting buildings in posher neighborhoods. It doesn’t really lead to reduced rent (because no additional supply), but it decreases social segregation. That alone is critical to keep a city alive. reply rTX5CMRXIfFG 19 hours agoparent> build taller As someone who lives in an area with plenty of high-density residential buildings, I can attest that this is a perfect recipe for creating congested cities with such intense light and noise pollution. reply digging 19 hours agorootparentLight pollution is relatively easily solved, there's just not much will to do so. Noise pollution is best solved by reducing car-dependency which is a non-starter in most North American cities; I can't speak for Europe but I understand Paris to have undertaken a serious revolution in purging cars within the past decade. reply vladvasiliu 18 hours agorootparent> I understand Paris to have undertaken a serious revolution in purging cars within the past decade. The issue is that they have mainly increased the friction of using cars in the city (reducing lanes, restricting parking, converting avenues to one-way) all the while the public transit enhancements are running late, and whatever lines were already there saw a drop in service quality. So increasing density would require a major improvement in public transit. Note, however, that the city of Paris proper already has one of the highest densities in the world. reply mpweiher 16 hours agorootparent> [increase friction for cars...no improvement to public transport] Hmm...aren't you forgetting something? Last I checked, Paris had a veritable bicycling revolution. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Paris Le Plan vélo de Paris (2015-2020) doubled bicycle lanes to 1000km and increased ridership (apparently already high?) by 50% or more. The current plan is to add another 180km and make Paris 100% cyclable. reply vladvasiliu 14 hours agorootparentSure, if you live in the city proper. But what that doesn't mention: the bike sharing schemes are hit-and-miss. I usually commute each way a good hour before rush-hour traffic, so I have a good probability of finding a usable bike. But during rush hour? Fat chance. Oh, you're going to point out that there's a scheme helping you purchase your own bike? Indeed. What are you going to do with it, though? At home, you may be able to find a spot to park in your flat (it's not my case). You wanna leave it outside? Sure, go ahead, if you don't care about finding it in one piece in the morning. Ditto for the other end of your commute. There's also the fact that bike sharing schemes only work in Paris proper and adjacent towns. If you want to commute in from further away [0], you better be ready to ride in traffic and have your own bike, assuming you don't live that far. If you're lucky enough to live in one of the places served by the new metro, it's still not ready (but should be real soon now - fingers crossed). So sure, having more dedicated bike lanes (and some of the new ones are actually physically separate from car lanes) is great. Although sometimes the layout is... puzzling? Bike lanes switching from the left to the right side of the roads, narrow two-way lanes (Bd Sébastopol), etc. But I wouldn't exactly call it a \"revolution\" in practice. My commute goes from the east to the northwest of the city, around 7 km. Of these, only around 1 km is a bike lane separate from the traffic. And it's ridiculously narrow. Bonus points for it being painted with a slippery paint for some reason (look up Boulevard Magenta). The rest is half on bike lanes shared with a bus, the other half on regular roads with no bike lane at all. --- [0] Don't forget that Paris proper is home to ~2M people, while the Paris Region has ~12M. reply cycomanic 10 hours agorootparentThe original post was complaining about increasing density and how investment in public transport hasn't kept up. The previous poster said what about bikes, and you are now saying that bikes are not a solution to people coming from the greater Paris region. But that was not what we are talking about, we were talking about higher density (=more people) in Paris proper. Bikes are certainly a solution to transport in the high density city. reply vladvasiliu 1 hour agorootparentOnly part of my answer was about people coming in from afar. The other, about there being nowhere to store bikes, as well as questionable quality of the biking infrastructure is about the city itself. Edit: I'm actually saying this as someone who enjoys and actually does bike. When living in the city proper, I think there are very few routes for which the bike isn't the quickest method of transportation. For my commute, which is pretty much a best-case scenario (modern metro with few to no issues, goes in a fairly straight line, don't have to change lines, stations close to both home and the office) the bike is much faster: 20 instead of 30 minutes. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentprevOne reason I don't get a bike here in Seattle is because bike theft is just way too common, and I have no way to secure it in my house (not enclosed garage, no space inside to keep it). It is funny, because they have better infrastructure now, but the theft problem (and lack of police/government care for the problem) means less people are actually riding bikes here. reply mrpopo 14 hours agorootparentprevSafe (locked) bike parks are popping up everywhere in Paris reply vladvasiliu 1 hour agorootparentWhere everywhere? I haven't seen any recently. Are those being up in underground parking lots?

Do offices generally have showers? reply Fradow 2 minutes agorootparentOffices generally don't have showers. People also generally don't arrive sweaty when biking (at least not more than those taking public transportation in the summer). To avoid being sweaty: go slower to not over-exert yourself, wear less clothing (you might be a bit cold when starting your commute, but that's not a big deal), and if it's still not enough (not fit enough, hills, etc...), an electric-assisted bike might be the solution. twelve40 12 hours agorootparentprevthey don't; it's just not practical. You have to be relatively fit and energetic to do it every day, have no chores like kids pickup, have extra time on your hands, the weather has to be perfect - no rain or god forbid snow. This only works for a particular segment of working people out there. reply vladvasiliu 1 hour agorootparentI'm not so sure that's an issue for the general population. My main gripe is actually availability of bikes in the bike-sharing scheme, since I can't bring up my own in the office, and since I work in a shady area, there's no way I'd leave it outside for the day. I also like the flexibility of not having to use my bike both ways. Think catching a movie or whatever after work and possibly getting a drink with friends. Although this is related to not wanting to leave the bike unattended for any period of time. But nowadays, with electric bikes, unless you live on top of Montmartre hill (and even then), I think it's no longer an issue. I have a colleague who takes her two children to school on bike before riding into the office (she works in a different office, where they have an interior yard with bike racks). Her bike's got electric assistance and she doesn't seem to arrive out of breath or anything. She also doesn't seem exceptionally sporty. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the climate. If you live in California or west coast outside of rainy seasons, there really isn't much of a problem unless you have a huge hill to climb on the way to work. Actually, that was my problem in Lausanne (3D town, I road up the hill every morning, and would be a bit sweaty, but I had my own office so I didn't care). Riding worked for a particular phase of my life, now it doesn't, since I have a kid to take care of and the bike theft problem has gotten out of control in my locale. reply bouzouk 11 hours agorootparentprevI live in Paris, I have 2 small kids, and I don't have much time on my hands (founder).

A quick search reveals that the average winter temperature in the Netherlands is above freezing, while average summer temperatures hover around 20C. Sounds positively delightful for biking. That’s not the case for much of North America. Where I come from, generally in the Great Lakes region, the average temperatures range from -1C to 30C during the year. Not great for year-round commuting by bike.

They've made car travel harder without making public transport any better (outside of London), which has just lowered the average person's productivity rather than making any headway into tackling the core issue of people getting from A to B quicker, cheaper, with less pollution. They put in some heavy traffic restrictions in my local city of Oxford by closing off residential roads, forcing all traffic down \"arterial\" roads instead and putting parking restrictions all over the place. A year later, there are no fewer cars on the road or increased public transport usage; some local studies by the university confirmed that. People just spend more time stuck in traffic travelling longer distances. It's like having a person with an injured leg and a missing one. Instead of giving the person a prosthesis to remove the load, they've just lopped the other off altogether, leaving them to crawl from place to place instead of hobble. reply mpweiher 16 hours agorootparent> [car travel harder without making public transport better] Erm aren't you forgetting something?

Hence “Aren’t you forgetting something” rather than “you’re wrong” reply amanaplanacanal 16 hours agorootparentprevI feel like the best way to make getting from A to B quicker is for A and B to be closer together. Which makes walking or biking more practical and you don’t have to spend as much money on public transit. reply bombcar 13 hours agorootparentA and B being closer works for cars, too. A 15 minute walk is 2 minutes by car, five by bike. reply mattkrause 9 hours agorootparentOnly to a point, because car trips have more “friction” especially in a city. For example, you might need to spend some time getting to/from the car or wending your way through a parking structure. You may need to drive a more circuitous route due to one-way streets—-and certainly can’t cut through a park or building. You don’t need fuel/charging or maintenance every trip but it amortizes out to a small delay. And there’s traffic! Anecdotally, a 15 minute walk (~1 mile) is probably about the break-even point. My spouse and I both went that far yesterday, one in a car and one walking, and yet we both got home at almost exactly the same time. reply digging 10 hours agorootparentprev> A and B being closer works for cars, too. Only when the distances are greater than short-walk distance. Cars take up (huge amounts of) space at their destination by parking. You can only push two destinations so close together before their parking lots merge. reply MichaelZuo 16 hours agorootparentprev‘ making public transport any better (outside of London)’ is not really under the government’s control until after the local electorate agrees to it. So it’s a moot point when only one decision pathway can actually be budged by more then a few inches. reply 8note 16 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn't sound right? If you increase density, you should be avoiding the need to improve public transit, as more people will be closer to their destination than it's worth driving to. For the same population increase, less density means people have to travel farther to get to their destination. More people travelling farther necessitates more public transit reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentSuppose that you have a grid-like road network across an area of 100 square miles, where intersecting roads go north-south and east-west and roads are half a mile apart. If you want to get from one corner of the square to the adjacent one, you have to travel 10 miles. If there are a million people doing this, you have ten million vehicle miles. Now suppose you compress this many people into an area of 25 square miles, where the roads are still half a mile apart. Now the distance along one of the edges is 5 miles and the same million people only have to travel 5 million miles. But now instead of having 400 miles of roads (10/0.5 * 10 on each axis), you have 100 miles of roads (5/0.5 * 5 * 2), so each road has twice as many cars, or each bus has to carry twice as many passengers or whatever. This is why mass transit works in cities and not in the suburbs. In a city you have enough passengers to fill the bus or subway car, in the suburbs you don't. But if you increase the density without putting in any mass transit, you just get more traffic. On the other hand, the people who say we can't increase density until we build mass transit are full of crap. You can add a bus route in a day, you just buy a bus and hire a driver. In urban areas subways are generally more efficient, and those take time to build, but you can run a bus until the subway is built. It's no excuse to hold up housing construction. reply dublinben 14 hours agorootparentYou can't assume that the number of cars is a constant though. As point A and point B become farther apart, car usage goes up. When they become closer together, car usage scales down. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentBut as point A and point B become closer together, it takes less time to get there by car and then people do it more often. Unless traffic congestion eats the time savings, implying that there is high traffic congestion. reply dublinben 13 hours agorootparentCities are populated by people, not cars. As point A and point B become closer, people are less likely to drive. If your mailbox is attached to your house, you can lean out your front door to get your mail. If your mailbox is at the end of your 20 foot driveway, you take a few steps to get your mail. If you live on a farm, and your mailbox is down a several hundred yard driveway, you might hop in your side-by-side UTV. If your mail goes to a Post Office Box in town, you might hop in your truck and pick it up while running errands. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentIf you make something more efficient, people often use more of it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox If things that had been a 10 minute drive become a 5 minute drive, now they're worth it when before they weren't. You go to the shop instead of waiting 2 days for Amazon. You go to the shop you like more instead of the one you like less even though the lesser one is closer, because now the difference isn't as big. reply digging 10 hours agorootparentIt's not only a function of trip length. If you make the drive shorter but make parking harder, and you make the walk/bike shorter but walking/biking pleasant, people will take their cars less. reply bombcar 13 hours agorootparentprevThere's a finite number of trips people can practically do - just because they live next door to work doesn't mean they'll commute more than twice each day (close enough people will return for home for lunch perhaps). As traffic and travel times lessen, people do travel further and more, but only to a point. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentBut who was contending otherwise? You don't need it to be infinite, to be a problem all it has to do is not allow the reduction in driving because now distances are shorter and sometimes people can walk to not exceed the increase in density because now four times as many people are in the same area. Which it might not have done even without this, depending on how much more often shorter distances cause people to walk. reply digging 17 hours agorootparentprevThat is unfortunate but realistically there's never going to be a political overhaul of that scale where all moves are perfectly synced.

Thankfully, in Paris and a handful of other cities, leaders are recognizing this and working on making walking, riding a bike and transit legal, safe and enjoyable again. So if you and other ardent motorists want to continue to exercise your free choice to drive, you will no longer be able to do so at the expense of everyone else, you will have to pay your fair share for roads and parking and accept that all space no longer belongs to you by default. > I'm also saying, artificially creating issues by removing roads, making them one way etc, in order to create terrible traffic, in order to then justify removing cars completely, is a form of manipulative abuse, being inflicted on people by government.

So Paris is a mix of Haussmannian building heights and higher.) In the 50es through 70es, there was a strong need for extra housing which led to the projects outside Paris (\"citées\"), to many factories torn down to make space, but also to much higher residential buildings here and there. Still worked fine (well, not many of the citées worked fine). And people really, but REALLY love being able to walk to their preferred local baker and pastry shop (out of a choice of several of course), and to the local grocery store.

There is a difference between refusing new people and having population growth as a goal. People exist, they have to live somewhere, increasing density increases the housing stock and gives them somewhere to live. If one city is hostile to giving them somewhere to live and another isn't, people might move from the hostile place to the amiable place. But the solution to this is obviously to make the other city less hostile, not to make sure that all cities are maximally hostile. reply stefs 18 hours agorootparentprevparis proper is already one of the densest areas in the world (and definitely in europe). when i lived there i wouldn't have noticed any problems with crowded grocery stores or community spaces compared to the comparatively low-density city i currently live in. there definitely were a lot more people in the streets, other cities feel deserted in comparison. reply lostlogin 16 hours agorootparent> i wouldn't have noticed any problems with crowded grocery stores or community spaces There are so many of them.

Not that there's _no_ foot traffic congestion or lines, but it's the same thing that happens in a case where there's only one Starbucks in a sprawling suburb or business district at lunch time. A high density area is likewise it's own complex economy and system that seeks balance, when there's too many people in one area, you just go somewhere else or enjoy or compete with it. That's partly why Tokyo is simultaneously the most populated city on earth and one of the most quiet, clean, and least congested places I've visited. In my sparsely populated city that sprawls, it's extremely noisy, dusty, time consuming to get around, the infrastructure is failing, and I rarely bump into anyone I know, because people are only visible at the beginning and end of their journey.

Cars are reply kcorbitt 18 hours agorootparentI don't know... I lived in Barcelona for two years recently and had pretty bad luck. In addition to one-off incidents, some consistent noise issues we had: - The Pakistani restaurant below our apartment would regularly host receptions/weddings until 2-3am. The sendoff typically involved groups of 20-30 people banging large drums loudly and singing as the happy couple walked out and were driven away. - We had a neighborhood drunk who frequently (multiple times a week) would wander down the street singing Flamenco-style ballads about his unfortunate love life. My assumption was that the ex he was singing to lived on the street? Anyway, he had quite a voice and was great at projecting. - The building behind us was shorter than ours and our rear balcony faced their rooftop. In the summer one of the apartments there would semi-regularly hold parties until 1am. Cars were an occasional issue too, but people were a much bigger problem in that particular neighborhood. That said, I've also lived in dense neighborhoods with none of those problems, so maybe better norms/regulations are the answer... but existing noise ordinances in the US are rarely enforced.

Again, this contradicts everything I've read and/or is just willfully ignorant. You can't make EVs superlight by stripping down the body, for example. The battery is the heavy part and while they may get more mass-efficient over time EVs are now and for the foreseeable future strictly heavier than same-size ICE cars.

My thought process is that food also implies some level of driving (delivering pesticides/fertilizer, driving crops away), the fertilizers are fossil-fuel derived, and if you count the sun it takes to grow crops to eat (or worse, as feed for meat). The whole chain is pretty inefficient, too. Crops are pretty good at converting sunlight to stored energy, but animals and us are bad at retrieving that stored energy. The losses compound if we're eating meat. Walking isn't a particularly efficient method of movement either, to my understanding. The energy gets a bit spurious though. One could argue that if we're going to count sunlight going into the crops, we should do the same for the sunlight that raised the dinos so they could become oil. I also would wager that starts and stops would impact this heavily. The human weighs a lot less so they can accelerate/decelerate much cheaper. The car would have a better edge on a long, straight mile with no stops. reply OkayPhysicist 16 hours agorootparentA human walking is absurdly efficient, as anyone who's ever tried to outrun a bad diet can tell you. Running or walking a mile burns ~100 extra calories relative to sitting on your couch. Unless you're putting active effort into not doing so, most diets fluctuate by far more than that. reply hollerith 14 hours agorootparentSure, but it is also true that food that is healthy for people is an absurdly expensive form of energy compared to gasoline. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentIf we make free the largest costs of gas, greenhouse gas emissions. reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparentprevI don't remember where I heard it, only that it was an expert on agriculture saying it. The easiest way to see that it is plausible is to note that only 400 years ago, something like 90% of all human labor went into growing food, which is the way agricultural societies had always been everywhere. The way society was able reduce that to the 5% or so it is today was to use fossil fuels. The first big reduction came with the mechanization of textile production, freeing the food-growers from the need to make their own yarn and weave it into fabric to make clothes with. The tractor was of course also responsible for a drastic reduction in human labor as input to food-growing. Also, the replacement of horses with trucks for transportation of food from the farm to the nearest rail head or port or river (and transportation of inputs like fertilizer to the farm) meant that the food-growers could concentrate on growing food for people now that horses were much less needed. It's not just the extra calories needed to walk as opposed to rest or to watch television: it's the fact that a single person in a delivery truck can do the work of a dozen people who have to do the deliveries on foot, and keeping one person alive and productive costs only one twelfth as much as keeping a dozen alive and productive -- even if no one walks anywhere or does any exercise. Sometimes for example in order to remain alive and productive, one of the dozen will need to visit a doctor. The doctor requires food to stay alive and productive. Doctors don't live forever and so need to be replaced, and that is an expensive process in part because medical students need food and lots of other energy-requiring things to stay alive and able to learn (and to grow from babies to people mature enough to go to medical school). My guess is that that analysis continues to hold even if the dozen delivery workers can take public transportation as well as walk although maybe we have to replace \"dozen\" with \"six\". I'm not saying that restricting vehicles in Paris is a bad move: I'm just saying that the effects on, e.g., carbon emission is not obviously good and that the planners who chose (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Pa...) to devote a large fraction of the area of cities to make it easy for vehicle traffic to flow were not just stupid benighted fools or evil people bent on making life worse for everyone. reply abdullahkhalids 17 hours agorootparentWhen people suggest that we reduce the number of cars driven, they are generally not talking about reducing commercial delivery vehicles [1].

[1] Excluding Uber style car-based food delivery services. reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparentOK, but some people here are asserting that the more urban density, the better, and neglecting to consider that if the density gets high enough, the commercial delivery vehicles are stuck in traffic most of the time or the residents of the city refrain from buying things that would enhance their lives if it weren't so expensive or tedious to move things around the city. reply hirsin 13 hours agorootparentWhich is why if you've ever lived far outside the city, you're tired of people from the city coming out to visit you to buy all the stuff they can't get in the city.

Let people build 4 units where today it's zone for 1, and if you disagree, you're an out of touch racist/classist/luddite who is just not a visionary and can't embrace the future. Surely nothing bad is going to happen when you take a subdivision with 30 homes and take just 10 of those and turn them into quadplexes. 30 homes might approximate something like 60 cars and 60 children. Now instead of 30 homes, you have 20 + 10*4 = 60 homes. You're now asking infrastructure that hasn't been touched since the 60s to accommodate nearly twice as many people. And I get that not every new unit will also have 2 children, but some will and it no doubt leads to a net increase. Where as before the road leading out your development had to accommodate 50 cars in the morning commute, now it has to handle more than 100. And this is just a minor inconvenience. The real issues arise when you've doubled the amount of school children, but the number of teachers hires or classrooms built hasn't increased, and let's not even talk about teacher salaries. Then there are utilities and other public services (first responders, etc.) This was just one small subdivision with 30 homes, now imagine this happening across multiple parts of town at once and you can see the problem. All that is to say, I've never been against building more housing (omg build up! it's so easy!), what I'm against is building more housing without proportional investments everywhere else.

Why is this fearmongering? Because your figures are wildly, wildly out of touch with reality. If you legalize quadplexes by right, you're not going to magically see a doubling of housing, there just aren't that many people! That is completely made up bullshit. Fast growing place have growth rates in the low single digits, like 2%/a, not 50%. Growth projections for fast growing regions like the Toronto area have 50% growth projections on the scale of decades. But \"If we legalize quadplexes, our 100 home with turn into 102 home next years and there'll be one extra car\" just doesn't have the same zing and it's hard to keep the housing crisis going with realistic complaints. reply gxs 15 hours agorootparentHow is this fearmongering? I can just as easily accuse you of moral righteousness, it's not a cover for anything, it's what's happening and with neither you nor I citing sources, it's just your word against mine. Even then, come up with whatever cutesy numbers you want regarding housing, there are concrete numbers to point to for the side effects. Depressed teacher salaries is a well known issue. Overcrowding in schools is a real issue. Congestion and lack of public transportation is a real issue. You can argue causality all you want, but if you leave out suddenly overpopulating areas as part of your equation, it's already flawed. Lastly, you didn't read what I said. I said it's fine to build more housing provides it comes with equal investments in infrastructure. You conveniently glossed over this fact because your solution of building taller still doesn't address it. So no, build taller isn't the only solution. Again, reread what I said. I'm not against building more housing. Do you understand that? Again, I am not against building more housing. All for building out public transportation, all for doing that is required to build more housing. So either you take a slow and moderate approach to building more housing, which is fine, and will allow other infrastructure more time to catch up, or you make these investments up front with your larger scale development, as long as it's addressed it's all I'm saying. Not sure what you're so up in arms about. reply carabiner 14 hours agorootparentprevPart of the draw of a city is bustling night life.

Like many other cities, build more places where people want to flock so you get pressure off the center. Most new developments are in dead areas because nobody wants to spend time surrounded by ugly, bland and functional architecture. reply lou1306 19 hours agorootparentThe problem is, when you are competing with the center of Paris, it is pretty hard to build a compelling alternative. Say what you will about the streets being loud, chaotic and dirty, the area between the II, III, V and VI arrondissements (Latin quarter, Pantheon, Beaubourg, Jardin du Luxembourg, Tuilleries, Notre Dame, Place des Vosges) is still just swell. reply mebazaa 19 hours agorootparentYeah, and also you have the problem of job location. The regional government says they want to make the Paris area more \"polycentric\", but there’s a limit to that if jobs are heavily concentrated in one area. We are racing to open more subway lines, and that will surely help, but at some point, raw distance will remain a bottleneck. reply Ragnarork 18 hours agorootparentThis reminds of the project that aimed at creating a new business/commercial complex south-east of Paris in Noisy-Le-Grand. A real estate promoter had a big project, and a metro line was designed, then built, but the real estate project went into bankruptcy and never got out of the ground.[0] The metro line was completed, inaugurated, but never opened to the public, and eventually mothballed. For quite a while, it was rumored that they operated trains once a month to keep the system working and maintained, not sure up until when.

Its entirely possible to build a new city from the ground up. And starting with a clean slate allows planners to design with the next 10,20,30,50 years of growth in mind.

There's a big difference between building a tall building with a large uniform floorplate that takes up much of a block and a tall building that is thin, only taking up a tiny slice of a block, and thus allowing sunlight to pass through.

Given that each of us is allotted exactly 8,760 hours in a year: Is it good public policy to force non-wealthy people to spend so many more of those hours in commuting than those who can afford to live closer to their jobs? I live in a small, separately-incorporated city, a few minutes from downtown Houston, that has become increasingly wealthy. For several decades, the affordable bungalows built in the years following 1930s have been torn down and replaced by big houses. (Yes, my wife and I did that to build our house, more than 35 years ago.) Nowadays, though, many really big single-family homes are being put up on what used to be two-, three-, and four single-house lots. I get disgruntled every time we walk by one of those giant houses, because every one of them is, in effect, forcing two or more less-wealthy families to live further away — they're hoarding the space. (My own thought is that for big, space-hoarding houses like that, property taxes should be progressive, so that such a house might be taxed at 2X, 3X, 4X, 10X the per-foot rate of houses on smaller lots.) reply rayiner 13 hours agorootparent> Given that each of us is allotted exactly 8,760 hours in a year: Is it good public policy to force non-wealthy people to spend so many more of those hours in commuting than those who can afford to live closer to their jobs?

The question is, can you achieve through public policy an economy where a large segment of jobs doesn’t involve delivering food to knowledge workers? I think you can, even today.

Meanwhile rich people only pay a fraction of what they earn in taxes, and “poor” people get most stuff for “free”.

Since the city is dense you don't have to move very far for prices to drop steeply, unlike sparser cities, so you can still keep your job with a reasonable commute. I know a lot of people who lived near the center when they were single so they were close to everything, and then moved 15 minutes out when they get kids. Selling those small central apartments give a big boost towards getting a nice home outside the center. Not Paris but the same European layout with dense suburbs, it really isn't that expensive since those dense suburbs are still very close to the city center relative to American sprawl like in silicon valley where you have to drive for an hour to reach a cheap place, in Europe if you drive for an hour you get to the next city so even the cheapest suburbs are much closer than that. reply HenriTEL 12 hours agorootparentprevWith 2 children you'll need about 65sqm.

Why work your butt off for 10 years to get to a place where you can afford a nice dwelling if you can also wait 10 years, working but not pushing yourself, and someone else will pay for it for you? And then once you have it, there's even less incentive to try to \"move up\" from there, because there's now a cliff in front of you. You have to make the whole jump in one go, because if you only take incremental steps, you lose eligibility for your subsidies. American culture doesn't like to think about how much of \"success\" is down to luck. As often as possible, we want to think it's earned.

It's not instinctively repugnant to help, or to give, it's instinctively repugnant to give outside their community. That seems a more fundamental problem with tax-rich/give-poor mentality. These folks make tons of charitable donations in money, in kind, and in time, but oppose wealth redistribution. reply snowwrestler 18 hours agorootparentThe hidden issue here is the effort of people with means to shape their community by expelling or excluding people they don’t want to help. Then their voluntary donations etc only help those whom they want to help. Well-known examples in the U.S. include the use of legal covenants, red lining, Jim Crow laws, and sometimes blatant intimidation to shape who can own which property where. Such changes persist for decades because of the illiquidity of property in general and the compounding effect of wealth discrepancies. So “outside their communities” is not a neutral, or purely geographic concept. Communities don’t just happen, they are intentionally constructed. U.S. governments, in contrast, are ostensibly bound by the republican concept generally and the 14th Amendment specifically, to provide protection and service equally. Even if the citizens in question don’t fit the preferred local definition of “who we want to help.” Edit add: I’m posting this because I think it helps clarify why some folks want government programs to exist to address social problems, as opposed to just counting on voluntary aid to solve it all. I don’t want to leave the impression that I think government programs are perfect or without flaws. I actually agree with the comments above that point out how means-tested programs can create incentives to “stand pat” and not try for incremental improvements. It’s policy problem that is well known but hard to fix. reply jvanderbot 14 hours agorootparent> Communities don’t just happen, they are intentionally constructed. I, personally, agree with your informative pseudo-rebuttal (it's polite and impartial so not really anti-them). However, the philosophical difference is that > they are intentionally constructed is precisely the point, they might say. I've come to realize, after spending time with them and reading \"righteous mind\", that the difference is so fundamental it requires a lot more power to cross divides than I have. I simply have to recognize the right and good intent in what they do, rather than denigrate it as \"not enough\" or \"in the slightly wrong direction even if enough\". I imagine a world in which they decline to pay, and therefore to receive, benefits from wealth redistribution, and urbanites who are highly paid like ourselves subsidize other urbanites who are not. I also realize this world would have \"rural\" covens of ube",

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT Intel Receives $8.5 Billion in Grants to Build Chip Plants The award, announced by President Biden at a plant in Arizona, is the biggest the government has made under a new program that aims to rebuild the nation’s semiconductor manufacturing industry. Share full article 143 An Intel semiconductor factory under construction in Arizona in 2021. The award is set to help fund projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. Credit... Philip Cheung for The New York Times By Zolan Kanno-Youngs, Madeleine Ngo and Don Clark Zolan Kanno-Youngs reported from Chandler, Ariz., Madeleine Ngo from Washington and Don Clark from San Francisco. March 20, 2024 President Biden on Wednesday awarded $8.5 billion in grants to Intel, a major investment to bolster the nation’s semiconductor production, during a tour of battleground states meant to sell his economic agenda. Speaking from the Intel campus in Chandler, Ariz., Mr. Biden said the award would support thousands of new manufacturing jobs, including ones that do not require a college degree. “It’s going to transform the semiconductor industry,” Mr. Biden said. “Where the hell is it written saying that we’re not going to be the manufacturing capital of the world again?” The award, which will go to the construction and expansion of Intel facilities around the United States, is the biggest the federal government has made with funding from the CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in 2022 to help re-establish the United States as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. The Biden administration, equipped with $39 billion in subsidies to distribute, is spearheading an ambitious effort to ramp up production of the tiny chips that power everything from smartphones to computers and cars. The effort is at the center of Mr. Biden’s goal to reduce America’s reliance on foreign countries: Although semiconductors were invented in the United States, only about 10 percent of the world’s chips are made domestically. “Nearly all manufacturing of leading-edge chips across the entire industry moved overseas to Asia years ago,” Mr. Biden said. “That’s why today’s investment is such a big deal: We will enable advanced semiconductor manufacturing to make a comeback here in America.” In addition to the grants, the federal government is planning to award Intel up to $11 billion in loans on what the company characterized as generous terms. Intel is also expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of the expense of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $100 billion over five years. The grants are intended to help fund the company’s construction plans in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. The projects are expected to create more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs and roughly 20,000 construction jobs, according to Biden administration officials. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose department is overseeing the distribution of the grants, said the award would help ramp up the country’s production of the most advanced semiconductors, which are used in artificial intelligence, smartphones, supercomputers and the most sensitive military hardware. The United States currently produces none. Ms. Raimondo said the Intel award would be the single largest grant to a chipmaker under the new program. The investment will help put the United States on track to produce roughly 20 percent of the world’s leading-edge chips by the end of the decade, she said. “This investment will enable Intel to produce leading edge, the most sophisticated chips in the world that will power our economic and national security,” Ms. Raimondo said at the Intel campus on Wednesday. In Arizona, the money will help fund Intel’s recent construction of two advanced plants and the modernization of another facility. The money will also help establish an entirely new site near Columbus, Ohio, starting with two factories, in its first move to a new U.S. region in more than 40 years. In Rio Rancho, N.M., Intel will use the federal funds to transform two plants into advanced packaging facilities, where chips are assembled together to enhance performance and reduce costs. The company will also expand and modernize an innovation hub in Hillsboro, Ore., which is expected to further the company’s technological leadership and development of new innovations. Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies view the semiconductor investments as a key way to try to turn around perceptions of the economy among voters in battleground states like Arizona. “We have not been talking to folks about the issues that President Biden has been delivering on, and that’s what we are determined to do,” Yolanda Bejarano, the Arizona Democratic Party chairwoman, said on Tuesday, adding that Democrats would need to talk more about the effects of the semiconductor investments. Although Intel will have to meet certain milestones before the money is distributed, senior Biden administration officials said they expected the funds to start flowing to the company by the end of this year. Patrick Gelsinger, Intel’s chief executive, told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday evening that the government incentives represented a proud moment for his company and a major achievement for politicians of both parties. Though satisfied with the incentives earmarked for Intel, he said officials might need to invest more in the industry to reverse decades of shifting investment from the United States to countries in Asia. “It doesn’t get fixed in one three- to five-year program,” Mr. Gelsinger said. “I do think we’ll need at least a CHIPS 2 to finish that job.” Intel is the fourth company to receive a federal award under the new program, and brings the total announced grants to more than $10 billion. The first three grants — to GlobalFoundries, Microchip Technology and BAE Systems — were to makers of legacy chips, which are created with older production processes but are still used in many products like cars and dishwashers. Biden administration officials are expected to announce more awards in the coming months to other major chipmakers, including the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Samsung and Micron Technology. Those companies have also made major investments in new or expanded semiconductor manufacturing plants in the United States in recent years. The United States’ dependence on Asia for its chips has become even more pronounced with the rise of artificial intelligence. Nearly all chips used to power the latest generative A.I. services were manufactured in Taiwan by T.S.M.C., though designed by the Silicon Valley company Nvidia. Intel has been trying to change that by developing new manufacturing technology, beginning to build chips designed by other companies and lobbying heavily for the legislation. The investment in Intel is intended to help enable U.S. companies to lead in the A.I. industry by ensuring there is a domestic supply of advanced chips. About $50 million of federal funding will be set aside for Intel to spend on training and developing “a new generation of workers for the semiconductor industry,” Mr. Biden said. Many semiconductor companies and industry groups have voiced concerns about potential shortages of technicians, engineers and other workers to fill all of the positions that will be created once the facilities are constructed. In total, private companies have announced more than $240 billion in semiconductor and electronic manufacturing investments since Mr. Biden took office, according to administration officials. Some chipmakers, however, have run into obstacles while trying to expand their domestic manufacturing capacity, resulting in delays.

I remember back in the late 90's, Intel had to fire most line workers in their FABS, and hire people with Ph.D.'s in solid-state physics. I actually knew one of these people who were fired: She was our housecleaner. And--like the supper-smart garbage man of the Dilbert Cartoons, she was very smart. Smarter than me. I know because she helped me solve some problems I couldn't solve on my own. Why was she cleaning houses? Tragic story. No doubt she could have gotten a Ph.D., but she was older, had some health problems which wouldn't let her work 60-80 hours a week. And she was black, perhaps discrimination was a factor too. I'd hate to even think of how smart you have to be to work in FABs today, but let me tell you, not even $8.5 billion is going to create more of these people. Best you can hope for is you can pay them enough to get them to work for you. reply gen220 11 hours agoparentIt wasn't just intel, it was every semi-conductor manufacturer in the valley (hence the inability to find other work). They closed because it was cheaper to build in other countries, or to outsource from contractors who build in other countries (where organized labor doesn't exist). The U.S. lost thousands of high-paying (and tax-paying) labor positions and atrophied the skills that went with them. Intel profited from it. These people were disproportionately minorities, disproportionately well-represented by unions, and had made a lot of progress in improving their working conditions re: use of terribly corrosive chemicals. All of that backslid when labor went off-shore. Now, the taxpayer has to pay Intel $8.5B to bring back manufacturing capacity to the U.S.; nice job, if you can get it. It'll be really interesting to see who takes these jobs, and how quickly we can rebuild the muscles that Intel shareholders profited from decomposing. reply postpawl 8 hours agorootparent> nice job, if you can get it TSMC is paying around $23/hour to manufacturing technicians in Arizona. They’re also sending people to Taiwan to get trained and apparently it’s brutal enough that most people drop out of the program. Asianometry did a video on this recently: https://youtu.be/Nk-lBok9_TU reply SmellTheGlove 5 hours agorootparentYou can do better than that flinging burgers at Dicks here in Seattle. That’s wild. For something that requires a trip to Taiwan for training, which I imagine makes it not an easy job, why does it pay so little? I’d think retention would be important if the training is that intensive. reply lucubratory 2 hours agorootparentIt's because in Taiwan that's standard compensation for this field, and for that specific project it's TSMC. They don't want to pay US rates if they can avoid it, and it's possible that their company would be unprofitable if they had to. reply JellyBeanThief 6 hours agorootparentprevI wonder how the much the pass rate might improve if pay were higher. reply rayiner 6 hours agorootparentprevYikes.

This doesn't make sense, Intel did and still does most of its manufacturing in the US, didn't it? (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_manufacturing_si...) I assume the thing that changed if there was a major loss of jobs was automation, not outsourcing. It's a lot easier to keep a clean room clean if you don't need to let people (with their hair and dead skin particles) in. reply typ 7 hours agorootparentprevIt's wasn't just the semi-conductor manufacturers either. The PRC had the supply chain from the bottom up (to some extent funded by the western consumers and corporations), whereas the US is trying to get reindustrializd from the top down, without first building a solid fundamental. To make the tough jobs easy, you must have the easy jobs done well first. reply coliveira 7 hours agorootparentExactly. That's why this has everything to go wrong. You cannot create the talent and the supply chain needed for this with $8B. The US needs to solve much more fundamental things like their schools and the local supply chain to even have a shot of creating a successful chip business again. reply rhelz 5 hours agorootparentRecall, it takes years to build these fabs. Fortunately, people will be more likely to spend years in grad school training for these jobs, if they know that when they graduate there will be fabs to hire them. Rebuilding is a chicken and egg problem, but it’s not as hard as defeating the axis powers in WWII. If this country has the Will to do something, it’s gunna get done. reply roenxi 9 minutes agorootparentThis is harder than defeating an enemy militarily. Defeating someone militarily is relatively simple to do; and every country figures it out from necessity. It is an expensive process, but ultimately mainly about deciding that the high price is worth it (and if the country can afford it/has the industrial base to sustain the effort, but neither of those things can be changed in a conflict). Building a profitable industrial chain is significantly harder to do and much rarer to achieve. The US certainly has the people to do it, but it isn't clear that the political trade-offs will be acceptable. reply gentleman11 9 hours agorootparentprevHow long until all those new workers are laid off again as intel goes back to overseas fabs? reply speed_spread 8 hours agorootparentAdd the numbers get bigger and the risks increase, the number of \"cheap labor\" countries where investments in large tech infrastructure are safe is shrinking every year. Maybe South America? Intel has (had?) a fab in Costa Rica... reply golergka 5 hours agorootparentSouth America is very underrated. People still think about the region in 20-30 year old stereotypes, but most countries have gotten much more stable, economics have improved drastically. Workforce is highly educated, different countries share a very similar culture and mostly speak the same language, which means that a lot of things can be scaled much easier. Of course, there's also Portuguese, which is still somewhat similar, and Quechuan languages speakers who learn Spanish as a second language, but this doesn't change the equation much. The only thing the region lacks is investment and ecosystem to attract and protect it. reply WWLink 9 hours agorootparentprevHonestly it blows my mind they were able to give control of one of the most important industries in the world over to a foreign country like that. reply eddiewithzato 6 hours agorootparentThat’s the power of slave labour.

Unless you are majority or largely controlled by your founders, who care about building a good legacy. reply shiroiushi 6 hours agorootparentExactly. It's why authoritarian and/or single-party nations have so much more potential to succeed. It's why China did so well for a while. However, in practice, as we've seen with China and others, authoritarianism only works well when the people at the top are really smart and don't have some major character flaws (i.e., the \"benevolent dictator\"). Eventually, you get a dictator who's a narcissist or moron or fruitcake and it all falls apart. In that case, the best case is that the inner circle will murder him in his bathtub and select a better leader before he ruins everything. reply rebolek 1 hour agorootparentBenevolent dictator is still just a dictator. As he grows older, he cares more about staying in power than following current trends. China wanted to prevent this with their 10 year rule for the general secretary but Xi changfed that and that was his biggest mistake. Democracy's weakness (politicians focusing just on next election cycle) is also its biggest strength. It allows change and adaptation. reply democracy 2 hours agorootparentprevYou cannot have a dictator who is not a \"narcissist or moron or fruitcake\" - this is not how human mind works. reply anonuser123456 3 hours agorootparentprevSeems to have worked for Russia. reply chpatrick 8 hours agorootparentprevBrain drain is a bitch reply whimsicalism 8 hours agorootparentprevi find this rise in nativistic and jingoistic sentiment weird. comparative advantage exists for a reason - we are not going to be the best at every single step of every single industry. reply TuringNYC 8 hours agorootparent>> i find this rise in nativistic and jingoistic sentiment weird. comparative advantage exists for a reason - we are not going to be the best at every single step of every single industry. There are more considerations than just profits. Consider how domestic PPE plants closed down in the US because even US gov institutions wanted the cheapest product, and went overseas. Then when COVID hit, we had no local supplier for PPE. reply xcv123 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is common sense and has nothing to do with nativism or jingoism.

This about supply chain security and national defense. So many of our components are made overseas and under governments who are not close allies. This is in order to operate things in our country. When you have the FABs in the US and under US control you can handle international foreign policy and the security of the nation differently. reply faktory 14 hours agorootparentWhile I agree with you I would say that supply chain is upstream of chip-production. The mining industry needed those money not Intel. It's the mining industry that's been neglected the last 20 years or so. It will take at least 10 years to get anything resembling chinese supply chain in place. reply kurthr 14 hours agorootparentThe chip supply chain is a lot shorter and more concentrated than the mining supply chain. If you're thinking of \"rare earth\" metals in particular, it's probably better to focus on the refining rather than digging out of the ground. Between South America, West Africa, and Australia there are lots of mines for most of the metals, but only refining in China (because it has been highly subsidized by both monetary and regulatory means since the 90s). Silicon refining is similarly bottlenecked even though the high quality input material is mostly US sand. reply beauzero 12 hours agorootparentRefining is dirty and dangerous so it has been pushed out. Used to work for a Canadian gold mine in Montana in the mid 90's. Most of the friends I graduated with went overseas for new mines or were Environmental engineers focused on cleaning up messes from the late 1800's early 1900's. reply kurthr 7 hours agorootparentYeah, lack of regulation is actually a pretty big subsidy for large scale \"rare earth\" metal refining. reply defrost 7 hours agorootparentWhat's a few inland lakes of acid residue toxic metal soup along with tailings piles classified as low level radioactive waste between friends though? These are still being created today, not just as a practice from the 1800's. It is the price of technology, better to address these as we progress rather than pushing them out of mind and sight and kicking the can down the road for future generations. reply BostonEnginerd 11 hours agorootparentprevThere's substantial wafer capacity in the US, from silane production, through polysilicon granule production and wafer making.

By not pursuing protectionist public policies. > the taxpayer is on the hook for $8.5B $8.5B is a big price tag, but whether the government should spend it or not depends on whether or not the investment pays off. reply pwthornton 14 hours agorootparentThis is way bigger than trade policies. Intel was the world leader in chip-making until fairly recently. Steve Jobs wanted them to build the iPhone chips because they were a generation or two ahead of any other fab in the world. Today, Intel is no longer leading the world in chip fab process. Intel at the time wasn't interested in fabing ARM chips, and the rest is history. Intel and American fabs fell behind for a number of reasons. Some of it is tied to our education system and the kinds of people we are training. Some of it is probably related to Intel turning their nose up at the iPhone chip making, losing billions upon billions of money they could have put into R&D. Some of it is a story of American corporate culture not innovating enough. reply rhelz 13 hours agorootparent> Intel at the time wasn't interested in fabing ARM chips, and the rest is history. Fun fact, in the late 90's, Intel was the biggest manufacturer of ARM chips. I was there at the time, and I wrote lots of software to aid in their design. What happened to Intel was twofold: The first problem was that Robert Noyce, Andy Grove, And Gordon Moore died. Each one was a once-in-century intellect, and it took Intel a while to be able to find somebody who could remotely fill those shoes. The second problem was Intel was making so much money on x86 chips, that dedicating any fab capacity to anything else--including chips for Apple's iPhone, would for years have had such a huge opportunity cost, that the shareholders would have sued, and with cause. Because literally (not metaphorically) anything they would have manufactured instead would have had a drastically lower profit margin, and the stock would have tanked. I suspect that the only reason Intel made a foray into ARM chips in the first place was to head off anti-trust accusations, and once the political heat was off, they dropped them like they were hot. By the time the market shifted, almost a generation of mediocre management had left Intel less paranoid, and therefore, less likely to survive. reply starspangled 1 hour agorootparentI don't think it was that Intel didn't have enough capacity to manufacture more. Intel was a manufacturing-first company that beat out \"high end\" and specialized competitors by economies of scale. Over the long term, the strategy was to build as much high performance silicon as possible. The problem looks like they went down the typical dinosaurification route that their vanquished high end competitors the likes of DEC, Sun, HP, SGI, IBM, etc., which was to switch from manufacturing as much as possible, to protecting high margin x86 parts. Their x86 PC and server organization out-muscled their manufacturing organization (either that or finance did), and so the ended up being very reluctant to adopt GPGPUs or ARM mobile because those were a threat to x86. By the time they realized they'd missed the boat in those markets, they put out these ridiculous x86 mobile cores and x86 GPGPUs that were costly failures. This pattern of protecting profit margins on high end products while fixed costs every generation increase and performance increases so low end grows up and erodes high end, causing further retreat and protectionism, is exactly what happened with those aforementioned big iron companies. When the bean counters look at the state of things without an understanding of the technology trends, that's the logical thing to do, but they paint themselves into this corner. Intel might have just been saved by the bell with Dennard scaling breaking down around the time they were losing their manufacturing advantage. That meant that instead of competitors on a generation or two process lead wiping the floor with them as they did to the minicomputers, it was a much smaller disadvantage and they've been able to somewhat hold on. That's my non-insider take on it anyway. reply araes 10 hours agorootparentprev> would for years have had such a huge opportunity cost, that the shareholders would have sued, and with cause. I've been considering the Intel issue (had family there) and the other post in the thread mention the decade of misses.

You might want to do something, yet your hands our tied, because the investors will sue for poor leadership. reply jacobr1 9 hours agorootparentIt is the classic innovator's dilemma. There are ton of incentives to keep the focus on today's cash cow in any business. reply HarHarVeryFunny 13 hours agorootparentprevIt seems that what happened to Intel was a lot worse than just missing Andy Grove's paranoia... - They missed the mobile market - They missed the gaming market - They missed the AI/ML market - They got multiple generations behind TSMC and Samsung in the fab business - They lost a whole bunch of market share to AMD, including datacenter The NY Times article is paywalled, so I can't read it, but I have to wonder what kind of fabs they are meant to be building for our (taxpayers) $8.5B ? I wouldn't have any faith in them building a SOTA fab at this point. reply sevagh 10 hours agorootparentActually, Intel has been consistent with their specialized CPU DNN libraries and whatnot for years. MKL and the likes are pervasive in modern deep learning stacks. Pretty sure they've captured as much of the AI/ML business as CPUs possibly can. Also, by gaming do you mean gaming consoles or gaming PCs? Because Intel is popular in gaming PCs also. reply HarHarVeryFunny 8 hours agorootparentSure, but those are CPU libraries, but what has grown NVIDIA into a $2T company wasn't building CPUs - it was building processors specific to this new and exploding field of ML/AI, which grew out of them building processors (GPUs) specific to the growing field of realtime PC-based gaming... Is the problem that Intel saw themselves too narrowly as in the CPU business rather than as in the compute business? I've no idea - it'd be interesting to hear the inside story of how all these missed opportunities went down. reply sevagh 4 minutes agorootparentI mean, if your benchmark is \"not being as successful as NVIDIA\", then yes, a lot of companies are failures. xcv123 6 hours agorootparentprev> Pretty sure they've captured as much of the AI/ML business as CPUs possibly can.

Any Steam hardware survey (the most relevant for gaming PC contexts) will show Intel handily beating AMD at around 66% to 33% for CPU[1], so your claim that Intel is somehow not popular is bunk.

Emphasizing the earlier statement: \"They missed the gaming market\". sevagh 4 minutes agorootparentYour point is bad. Ignoring the fact that Intel's bread and butter is the CPU, of which they have a dominant gaming marketshare, is obtuse. rhelz 12 hours agorootparentprevYou are forgetting two things: 1. All those happened after Andy Grove's time. 2. And when Andy Grove was at the helm, Intel did not miss opportunities like that. E.g. when Intel's memory chip business started losing market share to the Japanese (who were at the time a low-wage country), they were able to transition to CPUs in time. reply HarHarVeryFunny 11 hours agorootparentYeah, but what I meant is that these can't all be explained by not being paranoid (letting the competition creep up on you), or even by not having an exceptional CEO. If you are in the business of making CPUs, and obviously aware of how fast things move in the tech world, then how can you not be aware of industry trends going on like smart phones, gaming and AI? If you are somehow late to see the trend then double down and catch up. What about getting behind on process nodes/generations? This used to be one of Intel's core strengths, and you'd have thought they'd have institutionalized the things you do and don't take on in a new process to keep the change manageable. So, I wouldn't say it just a matter of not having Andy Grove - it seems like a matter of having incompetence at many levels. reply chiefalchemist 12 hours agorootparentprevWhen you connect those dots this feels more like a pseudo bailout in disguise. reply rhelz 12 hours agorootparentOh, its not a pseudo bailout. It's a bailout full stop. Doesn't mean its a bad idea. reply coliveira 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly what it is. With the added issue that, in all likelihood, $8B is not even enough to start making a change. The US gov would have a better time giving these $8B to startup companies in the chip space. Intel will just squander this money and give some of it to shareholders. reply markhahn 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's also interesting that Intel made some specific bad technical choices. (ie, not investing in EUV, assuming SAQP would work forever, ignoring the consequences of everything being power-limited...) This kind of decision is hard, because it's a technical-economic tradeoff, and the latter is more voodoo than math. And that's not even addressing whether you get surprised by things like the LLM boom... reply rhelz 12 hours agorootparentYou say: > It's also interesting that Intel made some specific bad technical choices. That's like saying Saudi Arabia made some bad policy decisions. If you are in Saudi Arabia, nothing has a higher return on investment than petroleum. If you invest in anything else, you are leaving money---A LOT of money--on the table. The result is that capital is drained out of any other business, and the country gets so dependent on just one industry that when the oil runs out, it is a major crisis. Put yourself in the place of an Intel CEO. You've just invested $4 Billion in a fab. People will by absolutely every single x86 chip that fab will make ~$40 billion over the course of the technology node's life time. Or, you could make chips for the iPhone, which maybe, perhaps would be a hit? And even if Apple's wildest projections come true, you'll make $8 billion instead of $40 billion, because Apple is not going to pay for Intel to pocket a 90% profit margin, when it could just go to TSMC. So you are a CEO, and wondering how on the next earnings call you are going to justify turning an asset worth $40 Billion into one worth $8 billion.... reply andyferris 11 hours agorootparentWas it not possible to build two fabs and make $48 billion? reply rhelz 10 hours agorootparentWhat would you do? Build two fabs and make $48 billion, or build two fabs and make $80 billion? It might be hard to remember now, but Intel was in the position NVIDIA is today: they could sell absolutely every x86 processor they could make, at pretty much any price they cared to name. So even if Intel could have built another fab (which, btw, it couldn't, the world only graduates so many solid-state physics Ph.D.'s per year) but even if they could, they would STILL have used it to make x86 chips. Literally (not metaphorically or hyperbolically) nothing else they could manufacture would have as high a return on investment as making x86 chips did. reply KerrAvon 4 hours agorootparentI don’t buy this completely.

I disagree. I live next to a fab and have coworkers that have worked the fabs. Humans in fabs are taken out of the loop as much as possible. That's because when dealing with nanoscale structures, human error is simply too common. One of my coworkers worked at the fab during a period where they had humans running the forklift that moved the wafers from one stage to the next. That was cut out because the tiny bumps caused by a human operating the controls caused imperfections in the chips that decreased yield (the metric that matters most for a fab). They ultimately removed that work and job and replaced it with robots to carefully move the wafers. What's complex about a fab ends up being not the frontline work, but rather the layer or 2 in the back (like designing the lithography filter for a given chip). That stuff happen outside the actual plant. reply rhelz 12 hours agorootparent> Humans in fabs are taken out of the loop as much as possible. This. We are talking about Atom scale here. I have as much admiration for skilled mechanics as the next guy. I heard about a lathe operator at Patek Phillip who could turn an arbor to within 1 micron precision, just by listening to the pitch the cutting tool made when trimming it down. And when chip features were on the micron scale, humans in the loop made sense. But chip feature are ten thousand times smaller than that now--4 orders of magnitude.

That did no matter when they were at something like 500nm. However, as they slowly pulled the node size down they started noticing random errors within their chips. It took a while to track it down but it turns out semi trucks driving past the interstate were causing defects in the chips. They ended up installing shock absorbers everywhere to counteract this problem. reply tyingq 8 hours agorootparentprevThere are still, though, lots of working fabs at much larger process sizes.

I worked in an R&D fab (albeit, as an intern, many years ago) with an abnormal number of PhDs around (the fab was essentially a small scale test bed for new products and processes - everything tested there first before scaling up overseas). I think we had a 5:1 ratio of techs to engineers. This was in a fab that basically did nothing but R&D and low volume manufacturing for defense. It's comparable to any kind of high-tech manufacturing where you have engineers designing/testing stuff (and designing the tools to make and test the stuff in the first place) while there have to be techs/mechanics/machine shop workers to actually do the work of making it. It's inefficient and expensive to put the engineers on that task, while they'll still need to do it from time to time. reply nickff 16 hours agorootparentprevYou cannot learn to assemble a motherboard using modern manufacturing equipment in an afternoon.

This is unlikely to change at all let alone be fast enough to influence outcomes. Growing sentiment after decades of the war on terror is for the US to be hesitant to intervene internationally, and while that isn’t current policy it’s predictive of future policy. It’s not at all clear that it would be popular in the USA to, for instance, go to Moldova’s defense. > the US just spent another hundred billion dollars on a foreign war in two years. The vast majority of this was accountancy fictions about the value of stockpiled obsolete materiel we couldn’t sell but had to pay to maintain or pay to scrap. We have demonstrably not gone all in on supporting Ukraine and Congress is currently strangling any attempt to do so. This is another sign of the US inevitably devolving into an unreliable defense partner. reply chiefalchemist 14 hours agorootparentprevI think you would measure it by trade deficits and trade surpluses. That is, now much \"stuff\" is moving around. reply hollywood_court 17 hours agoparentprevI imagine we’d have that skilled workforce if companies paid enough. I’m a former construction contractor who reinvented myself as a software developer. Each time I run into one of my former peers in the construction industry I hear the same complaints from them. “We can’t hire any good help.” Yet they are still paying the same non living wages that they have for 30 years. reply sfilmeyer 17 hours agorootparentI don't think that dynamic is the same in construction and in semiconductor manufacturing. Certain parts of the chip-building supply chain just plain don't exist in the USA, and so no one in the USA currently has those skills. It's not like there are lots of folks with the skills in the USA but they're all leaving the industry for higher paying jobs. reply lotsofpulp 15 hours agorootparentThe reason there are not a lot of folks with the skills in the USA is because 30 years ago, the US labor market did not appropriately reward those parts of the chip building supply chain. Same dynamic as not paying construction workers enough, just with a greater time lag. reply sfilmeyer 7 hours agorootparentI think the distinction is still important, in that the time lag is large enough to have changed the current dynamics, even if they still match on longer timescales. Raising salaries a bit could stem the outflow of construction workers, and raising salaries sufficiently could bring folks like the prior commenter back into the industry. But as more time passes this gets less and less effective, because there's no one left in the industry to retain and no one with recent enough knowledge to pull back in. reply javajosh 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat skills are they, specifically? I'd like to see companies like Intel make a resource describing them, at least, and at most, offer to pay training costs and offer a job at the end of it. reply autoexecbat 16 hours agorootparentprevThe type of work does matter. If I had the choice between a low-pay office job and a low-pay physical labor job, many would pick the office. reply bluGill 13 hours agorootparentThat depends. When I was young and the weather was nice the physical labor job sounded really nice. However physical labor also means when it is -1C and raining, or 40C with no clouds. Now that I'm older my body isn't willing to do that and the office job is a lot nicer (but my doctor keeps telling me to stay active) reply plantwallshoe 13 hours agorootparentprevYou, sure. Half the dudes in my high school class couldn’t manage to write a coherent 5 paragraph essay, so low pay office work is not really an option for them. reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentprevNot saying this with snark, but how many of those former peers work for companies with a clear pipeline to train people? Usually when I hear complaints like \"We can't hire or keep good help\" it's correlated with a company who isn't willing to invest in developing their workforce. reply bluGill 13 hours agorootparentNot sure where in construction he was, but I've worked framing crews before, and the boss would hire anybody (not disabled) who said they were willing to work hard. It isn't hard to teach someone the basic tasks and most people could catch on in just an hour. Most people though realized it was physically hard work and quit in a week (even though this should be obvious). Plumbers and electricians have a good start from nothing apprentice program. They are sometimes hard to get into, but I know a few people who have gotten in over the years. reply icyfox 17 hours agorootparentprevTo be clear, I'm not saying we can't have this skilled workforce. Merely that we don't have it today. So the pipeline to employ Americans for these jobs is going to require increasing the funnel of people who learn the skills, become junior engineers, learn more on the job, then become senior engineers. That's a long pipeline to beef up the numbers. reply spaniard89277 17 hours agorootparentI'm waiting for those job postings of \"Junior Engineer with 5 years of experience minimum\" in companies with zero pipeline of in-house training. reply s3p 5 hours agorootparentprevIntel pays its employees very well.

Also random YouTube videos are not scientific evidence. DEI has become a new conservative talking point but so far I haven't seen any evidence that such programs do anything to restrict hiring \"white and Asian male[s]\" as you put it. I've noticed some people complaining about what they imagine DEI means which is just the same old \"affirmative action\" complaints recycled. I'm not saying there are not some cases of DEI-induced discrimination - the world is wide after all - but that isn't what DEI policies/programs say in their text or how they're intended to work. I have never seen anyone saying we should lower standards to meet some kind of \"quota\". Again I want to point out that the numerous conservative attacks on affirmative action constantly claimed it was a quota system despite that being a flat-out lie. That makes me skeptical about this current round of conservatives blaming everything from the airline pilot shortage to fab personnel issues on \"DEI\". reply asabjorn 13 hours agorootparentYou are trying to dismiss my claim by making a moral claim about your opponents instead of formulating an argument for why my claim is wrong or an inquiry. To your claim there is no evidence. Here are some videos of top executives saying DEI enforce hiring & performance outcomes using Marxist oppressor/oppressed hierarchies: —- CEO of IBM @ArvindKrishna admits to using coercion to fire people and take away their bonuses unless they discriminate in the hiring process. “You got to move both forward by a percentage that leads to a plus on your bonus,\" Krishna said about hiring Hispanics, \"and by the way if you lose, you lose part of your bonus.” https://x.com/jamesokeefeiii/status/1734374423124176944?s=46 —- Carole Huntsman, Former Senior VP at Sanofi Pharma: “One in five hires NEEDS to be a black employee for us to meet our goals” … “One in ten HAS to be a Latinx employee.” https://x.com/jamesokeefeiii/status/1737986459007590636?s=46 reply 7speter 16 hours agorootparentprevSo is every black or hispanic person trying to get a job in tech or maybe thinking of going back to school to get another degree is a closet communist trying to… destroy institutions?

That’s not an argument and not an inquiry.

The US does of course need on-shore chip foundries for strategic reasons. reply mywittyname 16 hours agorootparentIt was not obvious to Intel leadership that the future of manufacturing was to become a contracted fabricator of the design of other companies. Vertical integration and total control over both design and manufacture of chips was the obvious (and, until recently) successful path. What board would keep an Intel CEO that presented the idea of shifting the primary focus of the company to manufacturing the designs of other companies whose products are in direct competition to Intel? Intel is a perfect example of why companies need to regularly kill their old selves in order to survive. But it's also a perfect example of why so many companies fail to do so, since it often involves making what appears to be a terrible decision at the time, and convincing a bunch of people who know better to back you up. Very few leaders have the clout to pull this off. The success of TSCM was the result of an interesting confluence of events: including the existence of ARM; Apple deciding that they were going to design their own hardware and outsource its manufacture; Nvidia developing CUDA; and the machine learning/AI revolution that drove demand for Nvidia cards. If you take away any of those pieces, I think TSCM doesn't become the powerhouse it is today. reply bgnn 12 hours agorootparentIt's TSMC. Their rise is waaay before Apple or ARM. Plug and play fab model made getting into semiconductor design as a start-up possible. Broadcom, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Conexant etc all used TSMC in 90s, way before smart phones and ARM-mania. Intel saw this coming but they were ahead and they didn't worry about it. At the end they got stuck at getting bad yield from their FinFETs, which is invented by Intel, while TSMC and Samsung moved forward. Iphones would have been using Intel processors if Intel had a competing product to be honest. They screwed that up too. TSMC and Samsung just had the right mindset and focus, and a lot of smart and hardworking people. reply rileyphone 17 hours agorootparentprevPat Gelsinger only returned 3 years ago, it just takes a while for changes to propagate through an org as large as Intel. reply FredPret 17 hours agorootparentI hope you turn out to be right. reply markhahn 13 hours agorootparentprev+1 this. Intel let MBA-think drive too many decisions (ie EUV). Maybe there was some misperception there, even cultural bias. Pat's biggest real change has been to push the company towards process leadership. They always had good designs, though perhaps also damaged by MBA-think there too. Still not sure about the decision to get out of non-volatile memory, though perhaps that was just a scope decision. Obviously, you could make a pretty amazing AI device with a whole bunch of NVM in-package... reply smolder 13 hours agorootparentprevShort term profit focus is arguably what led to Intel's engineering decline in the 2010s, despite what you say. An HN comment once recounted how they had spun off engineers into a another company and then merged with it again in a play to avoid pension obligations. That led to at least one frustrated engineer leaving and wishing them \"good luck with 10nm\". You often see other comments talking about how underpaid these highly educated workers are. Things seem hopeful that with Gelsinger at the helm, they may continue on the right path. reply Guthur 13 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet the US has been the biggest pusher of comparative advantage economics for everyone else via the world bank and imf. What is good for the goose is apparently not good for the gander.

You're living in a bubble if you think the biggest money printer in the world actually cares about the historical performance of your cherry-picked stock comparisons. reply FredPret 16 hours agorootparentNot 100% sure what you mean or why you're so antagonistic. Who's the money printer in your comment? Why are my stock comparisons cherry-picked? The companies I listed make money from chips. Besides - any investor can compare any two companies for market cap, revenue, and profit, even if one makes chips and the other sells sugary drinks. reply metaphor 15 hours agorootparentMy response was nothing more than a reflection of your remark echoed from a very different perspective. The money printer I'm alluding to is the US federal government. They own the proverbial money trees that $8.5B in grants will be plucked from. The US federal government is also the investor. They couldn't care less that the companies you're attempting to compare against \"make money from chips\". If the government wants money, they print it, end of story. Furthermore, these irrelevant companies aren't getting $8.5B big bucks for the simple reason that they don't have the independent capacity to make their own semiconductor products...they're fabless design houses, dependent on other companies' infrastructure and processes...more specifically, a certain most excellent company whose bleeding edge infrastructure and processes are physically located at the doorsteps of its greatest economic adversary. What the US federal government more immediately cares about are sufficiently advanced fab owner operators, more specifically, those rooted deeply in domestic soil...and who better to incentivize than a domestic former alpha dog who ate his own breakfast. Intel isn't leading at the margins anymore, but they're certainly not out of the game. If you're still not seeing the bigger picture, then I'd recommend reading this recently discussed[1] short story by Arthur C. Clarke to get a relevant feel for the underlying threat landscape.

Intel is notorious for shutting down projects like that just before they could have been profitable so they can \"focus on their core competencies\". > They need to do some variation of what Elon did to twitter. Doing to Intel what Elon did to Twitter sounds like a disaster. Yes, Intel needs a shakeup, but don't completely destroy it. It's the largest chipmaker in the US and has actual fabs.

What nonsense. Since Elon's purge Twitter has had and endless number of persistent issues that frankly are amature hour level bugs. He filtered developers by demanding they bring a printout of source code and explain it to him, when it's clear if you've ever seen him talk in detail about software he actually understands almost nothing about the process and details of writing code. This is both an ineffective and unfair way of deciding whether or not to fire someone. He also lost about half of Twitter's advertisers in a matter of weeks.

    "originBody": "Northeastern University researchers showed a group of parrots and their caregivers how to play a simple tablet game, then used it to collect data. Photo by Matthew Modoono/Northeastern University Parrots love playing tablet games. That’s helping researchers understand them. New research from Rébecca Kleinberger’s lab at Northeastern University delves deep into the data on how parrots use touchscreen devices, with the help of a bespoke gaming app. by Schuyler Velasco March 20, 2024 Touchscreens have long been integral to our everyday life — humans use them to work, play, talk with loved ones and snag Lightning Deals on Prime Day. In recent years, they’ve shown potential for the animal kingdom as well, leading to a growing body of academic research and a proliferation of consumer products promising to leverage technology to enhance our relationships with our pets. Northeastern assistant professor Rébecca Kleinberger and her collaborators have been at the forefront of that exploration, using computer interaction to enrich and understand the lives of dogs, orcas and parrots. Their latest research begs the next logical question: If animals are going to use touchscreens, how should we design for them? Parrots are helping them find the answer — by playing tablet games. In a new study released Wednesday, Kleinberger; Megan McMahon, an undergraduate studying behavioral neuroscience; and collaborators Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas at the University of Glasgow and Jennifer Cunha in Florida used a bare-bones, Balloon Pop-style tablet game to collect data on a group of 20 pet birds’ tactile interactions with their touchscreens. In doing so, they hoped to establish a framework to build tech intentionally designed for parrot use. “Cognitive enrichment is a crucial component for parrot health and well-being, and tablet games are one method of providing this enrichment,” McMahon says. “Designing apps specifically made for birds and their unique touchscreen tendencies makes this form of enrichment more accessible.” The parrot participants ranged from small species, like a green-cheeked parakeet, to a hyacinth macaw, the world’s largest. All had prior experience using touchscreens and completed the study in their homes. With the help of their caregivers, they learned to use a basic app game on Samsung Galaxy tablets. Adapted by McMahon, the game challenged the birds to tap multi-colored target circles of different sizes on varying locations around their screens with their beaks and tongues. The birds engaged in short sessions (no longer than 30 minutes) each day, playing the game over the course of three months. Seventeen completed the study; three dropped out after showing slight signs of aggression or a lack of interest during the training period. The game collected information on the birds’ accuracy, tap locations and frequency, as well as tactile elements like touch pressure and drag rate. The team’s data evaluated how well existing, human-based touchscreen design principles translated to parrots. Specifically, they honed in on Fitts’ Law, a formula that predicts human pointing movement toward targets. Some of the paper’s findings are intuitive enough: Parrots primarily use their tongues to work tablets, for example, which means their eyes are much closer to the screen than a human’s. As a result, they are quantifiably less accurate, and they fare better hitting larger targets. There was also a lot of variability in performance based on the birds’ size — smaller birds tended to have more trouble. But the data-based assessment revealed much about the parrots themselves, as well. Kleinberger was surprised “just how fast some parrot species can control their tongue,” she says. “Some parrots could touch the tablet up to 41 times in a row, resulting in a touch every few milliseconds.” That led to a real-time ergonomic adjustment: the team added a “multi-tap threshold” to the app’s interface during the study, making it less frustrating for the birds to use. “This …is a good example of how studying animals’ bodies can inform the design of new interfaces to empower animals,” Kleinberger says. The findings, to be presented at the CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May, signal a next step for Kleinberger and her collaborators. Their past research has shown that parrots — with their prodigious intelligence, high sociability and singular physical capabilities — are uniquely poised to benefit from touchscreen technology. Last year, the team showed a group of parrots how to video call one another, finding that the birds both overwhelmingly enjoyed the activity and could make the calls themselves, when given the option. The latest research further bolsters the case that touchscreens can enrich parrots’ lives. In surveys after the study was completed, human handlers said the experience was positive for their birds, and that participating in the study together was a great bonding experience. Kleinberger says that is by design. She stresses that the systems her lab is developing are meant for humans and animals to use together, and as an enhancement to their interactions rather than as a replacement. As with humans and touchscreens, there are potential drawbacks — some familiar (“Participants in our study often emphasized the risk of their birds’ overuse, likening their screen time needs to those of children,” the paper reads); others uniquely avian (“When asked what risks tablet applications could pose to parrots, the most common answer was ‘potential damage to the tablet.’”) In the longer term, the researchers hope the findings will serve as a starting point in adapting screen technologies for parrots and, eventually, other species. Kleinberger thinks it can bring some academic rigor to the booming “pet tech” market, “with new products promising to improve animal welfare with often very little data and research to back up the claims,” she says. “My goal is for these insights not only to benefit the pet tech industry but also to offer valuable guidance to the wider research community, technology developers, [and] pet owners,” Kleinberger says.

So much that is fascinating about non-human animals. I can't resist but think that there's a deep similarity between us, and them. One that we even don't suspect.

Seems like an oversimplification to me, and we don't know that they live their whole live in fear. We observe playful and happy behavior in plenty of wild animals, not only in apex predators. > I am not convinced that when animals are grown by humans in appropriate conditions [...] They lack any kind of self determination, take a milk farm for example. The cows are inseminated/raped by humans until they die, children are taken away from their mothers shorty after birth, the girls are destined for a live of constant pregnancy, the boys for 9 month of power food and then the knife. So many animals that we use including many pets, would run away, if we opened the prison doors. I fail to see this form of enslavement as something positive. > Do you believe all predators are \"morally wrong\", or only humans?? No, I don't believe that. But I believe you are making a false equivalence here, I have no moral qualms with an indigenous group of people hunting for a living.

But as a social species, we evolved some \"rules\" which ensure our survival. In that sense, some of our morality has roots in nature and evolution. So I don't agree at all that by not using violence all the time we're going against our nature. But in the case of food, I believe we are, because evidently we require certain substances to survive, and one of the best ways to get those is to eat meat.

It seems obvious to me, though I might be redefining \"smartness\" in a very human-centric way. It seems pretty clear to me that humans are the smartest in terms of analytical ability; you hear things in the media all the time like \"crows are smarter than 7 year old humans\", but I think that really depends on how you measure it. I am pretty sure I could teach a seven year old child that four quarters, ten dimes, twenty nickels, one hundred pennies, five dimes and ten nickels are all equal to the same amount. I don't even think that a seven year old human child would struggle with that terribly; I'm pretty sure I knew that five one-dollar bills was the same thing as a five dollar bill at that point. I don't think any other animal is capable of making those equivalencies though; I am pretty sure that a crow could not be taught this, no matter how hard you tried. Now, it's entirely possible that assigning weight to this is demonstrating bias towards human concepts; this stuff might be obvious to humans because humans invented it, and thus comparing human and non-human ability in terms of human creations might be an entirely malformed premise.

I've heard that one motivating factor for the ancient egyptian's strange-to-us mathematical style ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction ) is that when they divvied stuff up, they needed to do it in a way that was more obviously fair than we do. Example: we have four workers on our gang and need to pay them with 3L of beer and 3 loaves of bread at the end of the day. The beer is easy; just pour equal levels in three similar containers. For us, the loaves are easy too: give 3 workers 1 * 3/4 loaf and the last one 3 * 1/4 loaf. For the ancient egyptians (who might complain the last one either got smaller portions or more things) it'd be important to give everyone obviously the same portion: 1 * (1/2 + 1/4) loaf. reply miriam_catira 8 hours agorootparentOh this is by no means limited to ancient times, try giving any two young children the same amount of food, but cut into different sized pieces - smaller cuts result in more pieces than the larger cuts...

A closer analogy might be trying to teach a 7 year old who speaks a different language. Or even deeper, a 7 year old child who only knows sign language and you do not. The communication gap makes it very hard to figure out how much is a “intelligence” difference versus just being unable to even communicate the contents of the test. reply tombert 12 hours agorootparentSure, but even then isn't that making an assumption that animals have the same capacity for communication that we do? Let me try and explain; I don't speak Spanish, but if I had teach a 7 year old who only knew Spanish, presumably I, as a human, could learn Spanish and then teach the 7 year old whatever I needed to. I'm not sure there's an equivalent \"crow\" language that is even possible for anyone to learn, at least in the same way that humans have language. I know that animals \"communicate\" in some senses with mating calls and the like, but I don't think they have anything even approaching \"grammar\" and \"syntax\". But I suppose if you're going on a deeper level, if you had some way of directly communicating with a crow (like beaming information directly into their brain already translated in a form that they could understand), I still don't know that you could teach them that money equivalence analogy I used. Again, I'm speaking out of my ass here, I don't know anything about this stuff, just spitballing. reply Veserv 12 hours agorootparentNo. I am pointing out how being unable to communicate makes it very hard to determine intelligence. It is hard to determine if another human is smart without being able to speak the same language or explain the procedure and contents of the test. Given that there is no known means to effectively communicate with animals, we are restricted to tests that do not demand shared communication to identify intelligence. These tests must be benchmarked on mutually unintelligible humans. For instance, a grade school Chinese exam might be a good way of gauging the intelligence of Chinese children, but is a terrible way of gauging the intelligence of French children. Such a test is lousy in certain domains. We must be cognizant of such testing methodology limits in the design of animal intelligence tests. tl;dr A test that would fail animals and speakers of a different language are not good tests.

Yes, children aren't born knowing languages so you teach the child the language and then you can see it understands it. You don't need to share a language to teach language.

How would you teach (and know that they have understood it correctly) the concept of monetary denominations to a 7-year old child if you were limited to communicating on the level you can with a crow? I have no idea, and would probably give up. But this does not necessarily tell us anything about the intelligence or capacity for learning language in the child, it tells us only of the gap in communication that we cannot bridge. > so animals at least doesn’t have the same level of language intelligence as humans do.

A pair of geese chased secretaries and CEOs alike. Very egalitarian. No one was spared. All ran to their cars in fear. But there was one day when they met their match. Another pair of geese appeared like magic. Just wandering around like they owned the place. The original pair were not happy. They hissed and waved their wings in anger. The new pair did the same. Uncowed. The original pair decided to charge the interlopers and chase them off. Lowered their necks. Went full speed at them. Then slammed into the glass doors because they were attacking their own reflections. They spent the rest of the day, greatly humbled, swimming around the office park pond.

Read Later Peter Bagde / Typos1 / Abel Prize 2024 By Jordana Cepelewicz Senior Writer March 20, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode Abel PrizeAbstractions bloggeometrymathematicsprobabilitystatisticsAll topics Introduction Random processes take place all around us. It rains one day but not the next; stocks and bonds gain and lose value; traffic jams coalesce and disappear. Because they’re governed by numerous factors that interact with one another in complicated ways, it’s impossible to predict the exact behavior of such systems. Instead, we think about them in terms of probabilities, characterizing outcomes as likely or rare. Today, the French probability theorist Michel Talagrand was awarded the Abel Prize, one of the highest honors in mathematics, for developing a deep and sophisticated understanding of such processes. The prize, presented by the king of Norway, is modeled on the Nobel and comes with 7.5 million Norwegian kroner (about $700,000). When he was told he had won, “my mind went blank,” Talagrand said. “The type of mathematics I do was not fashionable at all when I started. It was considered inferior mathematics. The fact that I was given this award is absolute proof this is not the case.” Other mathematicians agree. Talagrand’s work “changed the way I view the world,” said Assaf Naor of Princeton University. Today, added Helge Holden, the chair of the Abel prize committee, “it is becoming very popular to describe and model real-world events by random processes. Talagrand’s toolbox comes up immediately.” Talagrand views his own life as a chain of unlikely events. He barely passed grade school in Lyon: Though he was interested in science, he didn’t like to study. When he was 5 years old, he lost sight in his right eye after his retina detached; at age 15, he suffered three retinal detachments in his other eye, forcing him to spend a month in the hospital, eyes bandaged, fearing he’d go blind. His father, a mathematics professor, visited him every day, keeping his mind busy by teaching him math. “This is how I learned the power of abstraction,” Talagrand wrote in 2019 after winning the Shaw Prize, another major math award that comes with a $1.2 million bounty. (Talagrand is using some of this money, along with his Abel winnings, to found a prize of his own, “recognizing the achievements of young researchers in the areas to which I have devoted my life.”) Abstractions navigates promising ideas in science and mathematics. Journey with us and join the conversation. See all Abstractions blog He missed half a year of school while he recovered, but he was inspired to start focusing on his studies. He excelled in mathematics, and after graduating from college in 1974, he was hired by the French National Center for Scientific Research, Europe’s largest research institute, where he worked until his retirement in 2017. During that time, he obtained his doctorate; fell in love with his future wife, a statistician, at first sight (he proposed to her three days after meeting her); and gradually developed an interest in probability, publishing hundreds of papers on the topic. That wasn’t preordained. Talagrand began his career studying high-dimensional geometric spaces. “For 10 years, I had not discovered what I was good at,” he said. But he does not regret this detour. It eventually led him to probability theory, where “I had this other viewpoint … that gave me a way to look at things differently,” he said. It enabled him to examine random processes through the lens of high-dimensional geometry. “He brings in his geometric intuition to solve purely probabilistic questions,” Naor said. A random process is a collection of events whose outcomes vary according to chance in a way that can be modeled — like a sequence of coin flips, or the trajectories of atoms in a gas, or daily rainfall totals. Mathematicians want to understand the relationship between individual outcomes and aggregate behavior. How many times do you have to flip a coin to figure out whether it’s fair? Will a river overflow its banks? Talagrand focused on processes whose outcomes are distributed according to a bell-shaped curve called a Gaussian. Such distributions are common in nature and have a number of desirable mathematical properties. He wanted to know what can be said with certainty about extreme outcomes in these situations. So he proved a set of inequalities that put tight upper and lower bounds on possible outcomes. “To obtain a good inequality is a piece of art,” Holden said. That art is useful: Talagrand’s methods can give an optimal estimate of, say, the highest level a river might rise to in the next 10 years, or the magnitude of the strongest potential earthquake. When we’re dealing with complex, high-dimensional data, finding such maximum values can be tough. Say you want to assess the risk of a river flooding — which will depend on factors like rainfall, wind and temperature. You can model the river’s height as a random process. Talagrand spent 15 years developing a technique called generic chaining that allowed him to create a high-dimensional geometric space related to such a random process. His method “gives you a way to read the maximum from the geometry,” Naor said. The technique is very general and therefore widely applicable. Say you want to analyze a massive, high-dimensional data set that depends on thousands of parameters. To draw a meaningful conclusion, you want to preserve the data set’s most important features while characterizing it in terms of just a few parameters. (For example, this is one way to analyze and compare the complicated structures of different proteins.) Many state-of-the-art methods achieve this simplification by applying a random operation that maps the high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional space. Mathematicians can use Talagrand’s generic chaining method to determine the maximal amount of error that this process introduces — allowing them to determine the chances that some important feature isn’t preserved in the simplified data set. Talagrand’s work wasn’t just limited to analyzing the best and worst possible outcomes of a random process. He also studied what happens in the average case. In many processes, random individual events can, in aggregate, lead to highly deterministic outcomes. If measurements are independent, then the totals become very predictable, even if each individual event is impossible to predict. For instance, flip a fair coin. You can’t say anything in advance about what will happen. Flip it 10 times, and you’ll get four, five or six heads — close to the expected value of five heads — about 66% of the time. But flip the coin 1,000 times, and you’ll get between 450 and 550 heads 99.7% of the time, a result that’s even more concentrated around the expected value of 500. “It is exceptionally sharp around the mean,” Holden said. “Even though something has so much randomness, the randomness cancels itself out,” Naor said. “What initially seemed like a horrible mess is actually organized.” This phenomenon, known as concentration of measure, occurs in much more complicated random processes, too. Talagrand came up with a collection of inequalities that make it possible to quantify that concentration, and proved that it arises in many different contexts. His techniques marked a departure from previous work in the area. Proving the first such inequality, he wrote in his 2019 essay, was “a magical experience.” He was “in a state of constant elation.” He’s particularly proud of one of his subsequent concentration inequalities. “It’s not easy to get a result which tries to think about the universe and that at the same time has a one-page proof that’s easy to explain,” he said. (He recalls with delight that he once used a cab service whose owner recognized his name, having learned the inequality during a probability class in business school. “That was extraordinary,” he said.) Like his generic chaining method, Talagrand’s concentration inequalities appear all over mathematics. “It’s amazing how far it goes,” Naor said. “Talagrand inequalities are the screws that hold things together.” Consider an optimization problem where you have to sort items of different sizes into bins — a model of resource allocation. When you have a lot of items, it’s very difficult to figure out the smallest number of bins you’ll need. But Talagrand’s inequalities can tell you how many bins you’re likely to need if the items’ sizes are random. Similar methods have been used to prove concentration phenomena in combinatorics, physics, computer science, statistics and other settings. More recently, Talagrand applied his understanding of random processes to prove an important conjecture about spin glasses, disordered magnetic materials created by random, often conflicting interactions. Talagrand was frustrated that, though spin glasses are mathematically well defined, physicists understood them better than mathematicians. “It was a thorn in our foot,” he said. He proved a result — about the so-called free energy of spin glasses — that provided a foundation for a more mathematical theory. Throughout his career, Talagrand’s research has been marked by “this ability to just step back and find the general principles that are reusable everywhere,” Naor said. “He revisits and revisits, and thinks about something from all kinds of perspectives. And eventually he puts out an insight that becomes a workhorse, that everyone is using.” Related: Dennis Sullivan, Uniter of Topology and Chaos, Wins the Abel Prize Pioneers Linking Math and Computer Science Win the Abel Prize Karen Uhlenbeck, Uniter of Geometry and Analysis, Wins Abel Prize “I like to understand simple things very well, because my brain is very slow,” Talagrand said. “So I think about them for a very, very long time.” He’s driven, he said, by the desire to “understand something deeply, in a pure way, which makes the theory much easier. Then the next generation can start from there and make progress on their own terms.” Over the past decade, he has achieved this by writing textbooks — not just about random processes and spin glasses, but also about an area he doesn’t work in at all, quantum field theory. He had wanted to learn about it, but realized that all the textbooks he could find were written by and for physicists, not mathematicians. So he wrote one himself. “After you can no longer invent things, you can explain them,” he said. Share this article Copied!

Reading his papers, he manages to connect basic geometric ideas (like the notion of \"isoperimetry\", i.e., enclosing the maximum volume within a given perimeter) to probabilistic notions like convergence of averages. It links together stuff you learn in information theory (the probability mass of the \"typical set\"), and in machine learning (deviations of an training-set error rate from a true error rate), and in probability theory (empirical processes). His papers typically had an introduction that related the main theorem to some of these basic geometric notions. The introduction would reveal a whole new, very intuitive and geometric connection between a very abstract theorem to basic geometry, like the volume of a spherical shell.

There is no need to assume bias in Wikipedia editors, the bias could just as well lie with those people who create the many rejected articles. Also, one criteria which Wikipedia must, by necessity, use, is “published articles in other media about the subject”.

We all see (right?) that one of the cultural topics of the XXI is about focus. In a relative past people could study and/or read \"all\" texts and be intellectuals or feel like that. It is obvious that the focus economy always existed but now there are zillions of potential content to consume (good or not, doesn't matter). Wikipedia, as an example, has the opportunity to add layers (not many) of content in the quest of helping (not solving) this focus problem. As you said Wikipedia does not currently has this purpose, but this does not mean that they cannot carry the lit torch and pay attention to the focus economy (wordplay just by chance). It is also important to highlight that Wikipedia has many externalities, it is not just them. For example, Wikipedia results are generally the first that cames up in a search engine and their content is much used in machine learning. In this context, the problem of focus is not just about Wikipedia itself but the \"focus graph\" that has Wikipedia as one of the top releveant nodes. reply tptacek 19 hours agorootparentWikipedia is premised on being a tertiary source, and pays a price for every \"layer\" of content they add in volunteer time needed to correct inaccuracies, which are constantly being added.

I will try to restate this, for the sake of an interesting discussion, in a completely different direction but using Wikipedia as an example: in software engineering we create different kind of tests for our software systems, I think Wikipedia should add \"unit tests\" and other tests to augment, fix, and link their current content.

I follow Wikipedia since its inception and it seems part of its processes, as in major organizations, amplifies bureaucracy more than process innovation. Any organization is not only their throughput but their processes, including resources as humans. reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentI'm sure there's any number of things they can do better, but revisiting their entire premise isn't just a suggestion, it's a request that they become a completely different thing. Wikipedia is probably the single most successful human knowledge project of the last 100 years. It sounds crazy saying that out loud! Maybe it's not true! But that it's even a colorable argument speaks to how little software engineers have to contribute to its fundamental direction. It's not about us. reply wslh 15 hours agorootparentI agree with you with the importance of Wikipedia but it should be noted the acceleration of technology (not talking about singularity!) that will impact them. It is the acceleration of the means in the relationship of humans with technology. This is a fact.

    "originBody": "(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window) Link Copied AI OpenAI’s chatbot store is filling up with spam Kyle Wiggers@kyle_l_wiggers / 12:15 PM UTC•March 20, 2024 Comment Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced GPTs, custom chatbots powered by OpenAI’s generative AI models, onstage at the company’s first-ever developer conference in November, he described them as a way to “accomplish all sorts of tasks” — from programming to learning about esoteric scientific subjects to getting workout pointers. “Because [GPTs] combine instructions, expanded knowledge and actions, they can be more helpful to you,” Altman said. “You can build a GPT … for almost anything.” He wasn’t kidding about the anything part. TechCrunch found that the GPT Store, OpenAI’s official marketplace for GPTs, is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs that imply a light touch where it concerns OpenAI’s moderation efforts. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that purport to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services, and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools such as Turnitin and Copyleaks. Missing moderation To list GPTs in the GPT Store, developers have to verify their user profiles and submit GPTs to OpenAI’s review system, which involves a mix of human and automated review. Here’s a spokesperson on the process: We use a combination of automated systems, human review and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies. Violations can lead to actions against the content or your account, such as warnings, sharing restrictions or ineligibility for inclusion in GPT Store or monetization. Building GPTs doesn’t require coding experience, and GPTs can be as simple — or complex — as the creator wishes. Developers can type the capabilities they want to offer into OpenAI’s GPT-building tool, GPT Builder, and the tool will attempt to make a GPT to perform those. Perhaps because of the low barrier to entry, the GPT Store has grown rapidly — OpenAI in January said that it had roughly 3 million GPTs. But this growth appears to have come at the expense of quality — as well as adherence to OpenAI’s own terms. Copyright issues There are several GPTs ripped from popular movie, TV and video game franchises in the GPT Store — GPTs not created or authorized (to TechCrunch’s knowledge) by those franchises’ owners. One GPT creates monsters in the style of “Monsters, Inc.,” the Pixar movie, while another promises text-based adventures set in the “Star Wars” universe. Image Credits: OpenAI These GPTs — along with the GPTs in the GPT Store that let users speak with trademarked characters like Wario and Aang from “Avatar: The Last Airbender” — set the stage for copyright drama. Kit Walsh, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained it thusly: [These GPTs] can be used to create transformative works as well as for infringement [where transformative works refer to a type of fair use shielded from copyright claims.] The individuals engaging in infringement, of course, could be liable, and the creator of an otherwise lawful tool can essentially talk themselves into liability if they encourage users to use the tool in infringing ways. There are also trademark issues with using a trademarked name to identify goods or services where there is a risk of users being confused about whether it is endorsed or operated by the trademark owner. OpenAI itself wouldn’t be held liable for copyright infringement by GPT creators thanks to the safe harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which protects it and other platforms (e.g. YouTube, Facebook) that host infringing content so long as those platforms meet the statutory requirements and take down specific examples of infringement when requested. Image Credits: OpenAI It is, however, a bad look for a company embroiled in IP litigation. Academic dishonesty OpenAI’s terms explicitly prohibit developers from building GPTs that promote academic dishonesty. Yet the GPT Store is filled with GPTs suggesting they can bypass AI content detectors, including detectors sold to educators through plagiarism scanning platforms. One GPT claims to be a “sophisticated” rephrasing tool “undetectable” by popular AI content detectors like Originality.ai and Copyleaks. Another, Humanizer Pro — ranked No. 2 in the Writing category on the GPT Store — says that it “humanizes” content to bypass AI detectors, maintaining a text’s “meaning and quality” while delivering a “100% human” score. Image Credits: OpenAI Some of these GPTs are thinly veiled pipelines to premium services. Humanizer, for instance, invites users to try a “premium plan” to “use [the] most advanced algorithm,” which transmits text entered into the GPT to a plug-in from a third-party site, GPTInf. Subscriptions to GPTInf cost $12 per month for 10,000 words per month or $8 per month on an annual plan — a little steep on top of OpenAI’s $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus. Image Credits: OpenAI Now, we’ve written before about how AI content detectors are largely bunk. Beyond our own tests, a number of academic studies demonstrate that they’re neither accurate nor reliable. However, it remains the case that OpenAI is allowing tools on the GPT Store that promote academically dishonest behavior — even if the behavior doesn’t have the intended outcome. The OpenAI spokesperson said: GPTs that are for academic dishonesty, including cheating, are against our policy. This would include GPTs that are stated to be for circumventing academic integrity tools like plagiarism detectors. We see some GPTs that are for ‘humanizing’ text. We’re still learning from the real world use of these GPTs, but we understand there are many reasons why users might prefer to have AI-generated content that doesn’t ‘sound’ like AI. Impersonation In its policies, OpenAI also forbids GPT developers from creating GPTs that impersonate people or organizations without their “consent or legal right.” However, there’s plenty of GPTs on the GPT Store that claim to represent the views — or otherwise imitate the personalities of — people. Image Credits: OpenAI A search for “Elon Musk,” “Donald Trump,” “Leonardo DiCaprio,” “Barack Obama” and “Joe Rogan” yields dozens of GPTs — some obviously satirical, some less so — that simulate conversations with their namesakes. Some GPTs present themselves not as people, but as authorities on well-known companies’ products — like MicrosoftGPT, an “expert in all things Microsoft.” Image Credits: OpenAI Do these rise to the level of impersonation given that many of the targets are public figures and, in some cases, clearly parodies? That’s for OpenAI to clarify. The spokesperson said: We allow creators to instruct their GPTs to respond ‘in the style of’ a specific real person so long as they don’t impersonate them, such as being named as a real person, being instructed to fully emulate them, and including their image as a GPT profile picture. Image Credits: OpenAI The company recently suspended the developer of a GPT mimicking long-shot Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Dean Phillips, which went so far as to include a disclaimer explaining that it was an AI tool. But OpenAI said its removal in response to a violation of its policy on political campaigning in addition to impersonation — not impersonation alone. Jailbreaks Also somewhat incredulously on the GPT Store are attempts at jailbreaking OpenAI’s models — albeit not very successful ones. There are multiple GPTs using DAN on the marketplace, DAN (short for “Do Anything Now”) being a popular prompting method used to get models to respond to prompts unbounded by their usual rules. The few I tested wouldn’t respond to any dicey prompt I threw their way (e.g. “how do I build a bomb?”), but they were generally more willing to use… well, less-flattering language than the vanilla ChatGPT. Image Credits: OpenAI The spokesperson said: GPTs that are described or instructed to evade OpenAI safeguards or break OpenAI policies are against our policy. GPTs that attempt to steer model behavior in other ways — including generally trying to make GPT more permissive without violating our usage policies — are allowed. Growing pains OpenAI pitched the GPT Store at launch as a sort of expert-curated collection of powerful productivity-boosting AI tools. And it is that — those tools’ flaws aside. But it’s also quickly devolving into a breeding ground for spammy, legally dubious and perhaps even harmful GPTs, or at least GPTs that very transparently runs afoul of its rules. If this is the state of the GPT Store today, monetization threatens to open an entirely new can of worms. OpenAI has pledged that GPT developers will eventually be able to “earn money based on how many people are using [their] GPTs” and perhaps even offer subscriptions to individual GPTs. But how’s Disney or the Tolkien Estate going to react when the creators of unsanctioned Marvel- or Lord of the Rings-themed GPTs start raking in cash? OpenAI’s motivation with the GPT Store is clear. As my colleague Devin Coldewey’s written, Apple’s App Store model has proven unbelievably lucrative, and OpenAI, quite simply, is trying to carbon copy it. GPTs are hosted and developed on OpenAI platforms, where they’re also promoted and evaluated. And, as of a few weeks ago, they can be invoked from the ChatGPT interface directly by ChatGPT Plus users, an added incentive to pick up a subscription. But the GPT Store is running into the teething problems many of the largest-scale app, product and service digital marketplaces did in their early days. Beyond spam, a recent report in The Information revealed that GPT Store developers are struggling to attract users in part because of the GPT Store’s limited back-end analytics and subpar onboarding experience. One might’ve assumed OpenAI — for all its talk of curation and the importance of safeguards — would’ve taken pains to avoid the obvious pitfalls. But that doesn’t appear to be the case. The GPT Store is a mess — and, if something doesn’t change soon, it may well stay that way.

Discoverability is nonexistent because search is just buried by spam. At least with plugins, there were only a few hundred to sort through, and most had some unique API they would plug into. For context, we built ChatOCR- an OCR tool that lets users extract text from photos and PDFs. We made roughly $20k from 39,000 users over 6 months on the plugins catalog reply barfbagginus 13 hours agoparentThere's a conflict in value proposition here, which is more drastic than the discovery issue. That might help you better contextualize the failure, and avoid similar risks in the future. Namely, GPT is now a multimodal trained llm capable of doing OCR over PDFs and images. Given the accessibility of that feature, we expect that users do not try to discover OCR plugins anymore- they feel no need. Out of curiosity, what was the contingency plan in the case that OpenAI did this? What rationales did you use to estimate the likelihood and severity of that risk? Were there good reasons to discount that risk? reply Areibman 13 hours agorootparentWe knew the time would come, but we built ChatOCR in a week. If we overthought the time horizon problem, we'd have 0 users and $0. But also, GPT-4-Vision is multi-modal but does not specifically use OCR. Our tool is used mostly to extract text from documents and load it into context, and we still saw growth after OpenAI built this feature into ChatGPT. reply nextworddev 8 hours agorootparent$20k for a week’s work seems more than good, no? reply sangnoir 8 hours agorootparentWhose week's work? One person, a small team ( Not sure what you mean: OpenAI's App Store doesn't charge and has discoverability. (hence the viability of the spam, hence TFA) I think the point was that the app store charge acts as an effective filter for spam, enough so as to determine the sustainability of the app store ecosystem. I could very well be mistaken though, that was just how I interpreted it. reply xandrius 13 hours agorootparentprevWrong thread. reply matthewmacleod 13 hours agorootparentprevIt’s almost like different people can think differently about different things! reply cdme 14 hours agoprevA tool to generate spam content becomes plagued by it.

Sure, there are other ways to generate unsolicited commercial emails. There are even services that will spam on your behalf. But, there's obviously a huge difference between an empty text editor and a service that generates plausibly phrased emails with virtually no effort. reply jsheard 14 hours agorootparentSimilarly, the worst kind of SEO grifters are now providing services which can mass-generate thousands of longform \"articles\" on your behalf based on nothing but a handful of keywords, or even scrape a competitors site and bulk generate articles based on their content. SEO spam isn't new but automating it on this level is unprecedented. reply mega_dean 9 hours agorootparentA recent example of this was \"theresawikiforthat\", which generated sites like ocamlwiki.com and juliawiki.com that were full of very low-quality information. They are offline now, but the ocamlwiki was consistently toward the top of google search results for a while last year. Here are some threads from the ocaml/julia communities as they started to catch on: https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/whats-up-with-ocamlwiki/13605 https://discourse.julialang.org/t/whats-the-juliawiki/109335 reply jay_kyburz 3 hours agorootparentI would like to write a bot for these kinds of websites, but subvert the whole thing, have no ads, no waffle, high quality info.

The monopoly they have as a search engine means there is effectively sole responsibility on them to maintain a usable internet. I genuinely feel sorry for the people that now have to figure out how search engines work in a world where anybody can generate reams of passable (albeit not unique) content in minutes. reply jsheard 9 hours agorootparentWhile the Google Search people are scrambling to figure out how to sift through genAI slop, another team on the other side of the Google campus is building a platform for publishers to generate that slop. By joining the AI arms race they've put themselves in the awkward position of contributing to the problem that's killing their own core product. https://www.adweek.com/media/google-paying-publishers-unrele... reply ilrwbwrkhv 8 hours agorootparentYup I saw the Google official YouTube channel comment on a seo channel saying these are good tips and the tips were basically let AI generate a bunch of content for you.

And also golergka is still completely correct. reply ben_w 13 hours agorootparentprevLike all automation tools, LLMs are very effective at getting more done. They're not content-neutral (no violence, no sex, etc., which some people complain about very loudly), but for anything not forbidden, gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 can output more for about $4233.60 than a human record holding stenographer can type in a working lifetime. When it doesn't have to be amazing, and I think spam is one of many things in that category, this is absolutely a huge deal compared to a text editor. reply klabb3 4 hours agorootparent> gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 can output more for about $4233.60 than a human record holding stenographer can type in a working lifetime. “This is the same picture” 1. Build your entire professional ethos on automating things 2. Claim that automation doesn’t make any difference If it’s not named already, I’d coin it “the hacker blindspot”: Scale is simultaneously paramount and irrelevant. reply phoe-krk 13 hours agorootparentprevSimilarly, the Haber–Bosch process is no more a tool to produce crop fertilizer than feeding corn to a cow is. Seriously though - the ability to industrialize and mass-produce that both LLMs and the industrial ammonia process have given us, for the bad and the good, is the real game-changer here. Treating two tools the same because both can give you the same singular result is an error if they have dramatically different - by several orders of magniture - speeds at which these results are achieved. reply probably_wrong 12 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever found this quote? > These findings, combined with earlier results on synthetic imagery, audio, and video, imply that technologies are reducing the cost of generating fake content and waging disinformation campaigns. That paragraph comes from this [1] now-deleted blog post from OpenAI in 2019 when they decided not to release GPT-2 due to \"concerns about malicious applications of the technology\". It's hard to argue that GPT and friends are not \"tools to generate spam\" when the researchers themselves argued that point years ago.

Please do share these intriguing cuisine and masonry techniques! reply pavel_lishin 12 hours agorootparentI think the majority of explosives are used for fireworks and mining, but I honestly have no idea how to get an accurate count of explosives set off in mining vs. explosives set off in warfare. reply golergka 12 hours agorootparentI'm pretty sure that majority of explosives by equivalent TNT or by dollar value are used in nuclear warheads for strategic deterrence, and thankfully have never been set off. But it would an interesting challenge to estimate all of these indeed. reply bevekspldnw 7 hours agorootparentI think you’ll appreciate the origins of the Nobel Prize. Alfred Nobel was born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden, into a family of engineers.[11] He was a chemist, engineer, and inventor. In 1894, Nobel purchased the Bofors iron and steel mill, which he made into a major armaments manufacturer. Nobel also invented ballistite. This invention was a precursor to many smokeless military explosives, especially the British smokeless powder cordite. As a consequence of his patent claims, Nobel was eventually involved in a patent infringement lawsuit over cordite. Nobel amassed a fortune during his lifetime, with most of his wealth coming from his 355 inventions, of which dynamite is the most famous.[12] There is a popular story about how, in 1888, Nobel was astonished to read his own obituary, titled \"The Merchant of Death Is Dead\", in a French newspaper. It was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died; the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will.[13] Historians have been unable to verify this story and some dismiss the story as a myth.[14][15] On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.[16] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize reply bdjsiqoocwk 11 hours agorootparentprevHe wasn't claiming that, he was just applying your stupid logic elsewhere. reply bdjsiqoocwk 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, they ARE more a tool to generate spam than text, because they can do everything a single text does, but in addition it can also generate text. So strictly more spam. reply samatman 10 hours agorootparentprevC'mon, be serious. It isn't the only thing they're good at, but they are very good at generating spam. I would even argue that it's what they're best at, because it's the one application where the tendency to confabulate is irrelevant to the use case. reply pants2 14 hours agoprevIt was a huge mistake to monetize GPTs. I and many other AI enthusiasts would have probably developed plenty of useful GPTs for free. But now I would never bother because nobody will see my projects under all the SEO spam and fake ratings. reply creesch 4 hours agoparentThat and even if they had proper reviews in place, there is no telling when they would pull the plug on the entire thing. Based on that alone I never even considered making a GPT for sale. Having said that, I do like them because of the openAPI integration. I made one for myself that can send things to a private discord channel through webhooks and can calls my memo instance (https://github.com/usememo) to store or retrieve memos. reply ilaksh 13 hours agoparentprevWhen you say it's monetized, are they actually giving anyone any money? The details of that were to \"to be announced\" but I haven't heard any announcement. reply Implicated 12 hours agorootparentIt seems that just the 'threat' of monetizing it would cause an absolute flood of GPTs to be launched, under the assumption that they would eventually get paid. reply vasco 4 hours agoparentprevIt's the fastest growth product in number of users in the history of the internet, to think they wouldn't run the Apple store playbook as much as possible is naive. reply MattDaEskimo 10 hours agoparentprevHave to disagree. When OpenAI didn't provide a method of revenue for plugins they were plagued with third-party paywall services reply pants2 8 hours agorootparentPlug-ins are a bit different because someone needed to host a backend for it. Most GPTs are fully hosted by OpenAI. reply Bjorkbat 10 hours agoprevReminds me of an early rumor back when Sam Altman was fired (and briefly re-hired) that the old board allegedly was very much against the GPT store. I kind of get why now. It arguably doesn't really aid in the non-profit's mission to pursue AGI, or share the benefits of AI with humanity, or any of that stuff. Doesn't even seem to be much of a worthwhile endeavor from a purely money-making perspective either. reply brevitea 9 hours agoparentBut it does keep users in OpenAI ecosystem vs. the competition. reply Bjorkbat 8 hours agorootparentYeah, but does it matter? Most of their revenue comes from enterprise clients and it seems more likely that someone is going to create a killer app for AI by leveraging APIs and publishing their work on traditional distribution channels rather than creating something that only works on a relatively niche platform. Like, hypothetically, if Anthropic took the lead in this effort, I don't think it would derail OpenAI's plans in the slightest. reply CSMastermind 8 hours agorootparentUsers on the platform provide training data that can be used to improve the platform which attracts more users in a classic snowball/flywheel effect. reply paxys 12 hours agoprevA spam-filled online marketplace is almost becoming a feature. That way the top developers have to pay and outbid each other to get featured and show up in search results, and that becomes a lucrative revenue source for the platform. reply klabb3 6 hours agoparentBingo. It’s the “platform-corporation” playbook only at 10x the speed. “Tired of drowning in the totally unpreventable noise of spammers? Well, have you tried our Boost product?” reply ActionHank 15 hours agoprevMaybe they should use an AI to automate moderation. reply bink 15 hours agoparentIt is a bit funny that if you apply for a job with many of these companies they ask they you do not use AI for the application. reply throwaway11460 14 hours agorootparentAs any company should. Not sure what's funny about it - I'm interested in the person. If using AI is one of required capabilities I will ask them to perform a task using it during the interview so I can review their process. In the same way I don't expect to receive an executable binary as a cover letter for a SWE position. I had many candidates submit absolutely terrible cover letters clearly made by ChatGPT. The number one sign - it talks about their experience exactly in the order I listed it on the job post; number two - I don't get to know anything about the person. I asked them to submit a cover letter they wrote themselves, and while not everyone's writing was as good as ChatGPT can write, I got to know the person, and hired few of these who definitely wouldn't make the cut if I went by the AI made letter. If you can have AI generate your letter so well I can't tell, you get a pass. Nobody was able to do that yet, though (or at least didn't admit to it, even though I'm asking after they are hired and saying that at this point it would only help them if they did so). reply StableAlkyne 14 hours agorootparent> The number one sign - it talks about their experience exactly in the order I listed it on the job post I wouldn't attribute that to AI; it's a very natural way to write a cover letter. You want to hit the bullet points in the job posting, and the most logical way to do that is to go down the list and check boxes. reply throwaway11460 14 hours agorootparentYes, but this goes much further - on a word by word, sentence by sentence basis. reply ben_w 13 hours agorootparentI've never seen that from an LLM; usually the error they make is I've asked them for too many things (a quantity which varies wildly), I get a response for about 3 of those things and a note saying something to the effect of \"put more here\". reply herval 14 hours agorootparentprevmost companies are using AI to filter out CVs these days, and cover letters written with ChatGPT seem to have a higher success ratio. I wouldn't blame anyone for using it, unfortunately. reply throwaway11460 14 hours agorootparentMaybe in first rounds. I am the third/fourth round interviewer. If a cover letter like that gets to me, it's automatically a no - not because of the fact itself but simply because the cover letters are terrible. reply basil-rash 14 hours agorootparentDon’t you see how the incentives become impossible? The AI stage needs you to be as obvious and direct about your experience as possible, the human stage gets irritated when you write like the reader doesn’t have a brain. Personally I send my resumes through a gpt with the job posting and ask if I’d be a good fit. Almost always the GPT will initially say no because I’m using some terminology that anyone in the industry would understand is a form of the posting’s requirements, but the GPT does not. But then perhaps the screening recruiter doesn’t either. So why not be specific? But then anyone else at the company might think I’m a moron… ugh. reply crooked-v 14 hours agorootparentprevIn a third round, why are you even looking at cover letters? reply badwolf 14 hours agorootparentWho is even looking at cover letters at all? reply kergonath 13 hours agorootparentI suspect it depends on the field, but in my experience it’s often a good indicator of success. A shoddy letter betrays a lack of professionalism. If you’re not going to spend 10 minutes running a spell checker it means that either it’s not important to you, so good bye, or that your standards are really low and you will keep producing garbage if I hire you, so good bye as well. The problem with cover letters is false positive (people who did not write the letter themselves, or who did it to a much higher standard than their usual). But then, that’s what interviews are for. I did hire a couple of people with either a subpar CV (some good people sometimes end up in dead ends or difficult situations), or cover letter (not everyone is a great writer), or reference (your issues with your former boss are not always your fault), or interview (you can have a bad day), so I would not rely on a single factor. But a combination of 2 dodgy elements is an automatic rejection. Each one tends to surface different aspects. reply ungreased0675 11 hours agorootparentConsider that job seekers today sometimes have to apply to hundreds of positions before being hired. For most of those applications, they won’t hear anything back. Given that dynamic, would you spend time polishing a cover letter for each application? reply badwolf 10 hours agorootparentMy recent job hunt was over 1700 applications. Nobody is spending 10 minutes writing a cover letter. Companies that are getting hundreds to thousands of applications are not reading every cover letter. reply mock-possum 4 hours agorootparentprevI guess my thing is that I don’t want to jump through hoops, I want to write code. You know how some people are enamored of those little ‘shit tests’ for relationships, they think they’re really clever? I have no patience for that. Show me who you are and I’ll show you who I am, and if we like eachother, then let’s try to get together and see what we could build together. if the entire interview process is a series of hoops that you dictate I jump through to even have a chance with you, then why should I expect my future with you to be any different? I don’t want that. I don’t want to write a carefully crafted letter pretending that I want anything other than respect and money and a chance to do work on interesting from a potential employer. I just want to write code. The rest of it is extensive shit testing in my book and I have no patience for that.

The prices on OpenAI's website are listed per million tokens, the cheaper model can read a typical book for less than the cost of that book in paperback, second hand, during a closing down discount sale, and even the fancy model is still in range of a cheap second-hand paperback (just not during a closing-down sale) for reading and just about the price of a new cheap paperback for writing — cheap enough it might as well be free. Plus, they're an intern at everything all at once. You don't get to hire someone who has a late-degree-level grasp of programming (in every major programming language at the same time) and genetics and law and physics and medicine and who has a business-level grasp of all the most common written languages on Earth — there is no such human. (If and when we can make an AI, be it an LLM or otherwise, which can act at the level of a senior in whichever field it was trained on, even if that training takes a gigawatt-year to compute per field, and even if inference costs 100 kW just to reach human output speed, it's going to seriously mess up the whole world economy; right now it's mainly messing up the economic incentives to hire people fresh from university while boosting the amount of simple stuff that actually gets done because normal people and not just business can now also afford to hire the weird intern). > and might even grow to good hires. Even if they do, will you be the one to hire them? Also, ChatGPT has so far existed for about as long as I spent on my (paid) year in industry that formed part of my degree. It wasn't called an internship, but it basically was. In that time, the models have grown and improved significantly, suggesting (but not proving, because induction doesn't do that) that they will continue to grow and improve. reply giarc 7 hours agoprevThe Apple App Store (and Google Play Store) have a fairly large barrier to entry. To develop an app, you needed to actually code one. Learning objective C, Swift or Java isn't easy and therefore you had to have some skill to gain entry. With the GPT store, anyone that could type out some instructions could build a GPT and submit it. There was 0 barrier to entry and the flood of spam was a foregone conclusion. They should have either vetted the GPTs, invited select developers, or charged a large developer fee to be included to increase the quality and reduce the spam. reply kristopolous 1 hour agoparentAnd you have to pay and there's a review process, and basically anyone who has released apps has had their submission rejected, the reviewers generously deny. reply mitjam 2 hours agoprevI use GPTs like bookmarks.

For me, Custom GPT is just a flashy term for bookmark and the GPT Store is just a social bookmark site. reply tkgally 11 hours agoprev> OpenAI’s terms explicitly prohibit developers from building GPTs that promote academic dishonesty. Yet the GPT Store is filled with GPTs suggesting they can bypass AI content detectors, including detectors sold to educators through plagiarism scanning platforms. The use of generative AI in academic contexts--both education and research--is turning out to be a vast ethical gray area. It seems that some people regard any use of AI for writing under one's own name to be dishonest. Others are willing to allow some AI use, but where they draw the line varies a lot. Is it okay, for example, to have an LLM correct word-level grammatical mistakes, rewrite a paragraph to make the author's point clearer, write a paragraph based on the author's bullet points, write a full first draft that the author then checks and revises by hand, translate phrases or sentences that the author has written in their native language, translate an entire paragraph or paper that the author wrote, etc.? Over the past year, I have conducted several workshops on LLMs for university faculty in Japan, and when I have polled them about the acceptability of each of those use cases, their responses have varied widely. At the institutional level, some universities discourage their students from using AI for writing at all, while others seem to be encouraging it. Just last week, I heard about two public universities in Japan that have contracted with Microsoft to provide Copilot to all of their students starting in April, when the new academic year begins here. reply pylua 10 hours agoparentWhat’s more unethical than the bypassers is the so called detectors whose claims are dubious. reply mistrial9 9 hours agoparentprevexample -- \"UC Berkeley Law School AI Policy\" https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/u-california-ber... reply jsemrau 13 hours agoprevAs I had written about publicly already, this doesn't surprise me a bit.

The web will be increasingly clogged with AI-generated content (e.g. videos and articles ) that can do a reasonably good job impersonating human-generated content to the undiscriminating reader.

It has to only be good enough to pass muster for the average person or anyone who is not paying close attention. reply visarga 14 hours agoparentOne area that's getting close to hitting the mainstream is AI agents that control web browsers or desktop apps. Basically, you tell your AI what you want to do, and it does the computer work for you, showing the results the way you like. You won't have to dig through tons of useless apps anymore. It'll search, sort, and create feeds for you. This is what scares advertisers the most - when we start saying, \"Just talk to my AI.\" God knows I'd love an AI that can fill tax forms for me. Operating on top of UI it is compatible with all devices, kind of like an android robot would fit well with all human spaces and tools. There is plenty of screen capture with narration to learn from. You can generate more training data by essentially giving free reign over a VM to an AI agent. Ask it to do office work.

The result is well grounded enjoyable \"regurgitated slurry\". It's a match made in heaven - people's opinions debating stuff and LLMs ability to phrase that like professional written articles. Grounding and style. I'm afraid in the future not even our social network posts will be directly read by other people. Everything will pass through an AI extractor-reformatter. As an experiment, copy paste a few pages of comments into a LLM and see the quality of its outputs. I often grok a new angle or make a new connection after reading the AI text.

A good accountant can do it for an insignificant[1] annual fee, and if he screws up, you know where to find him. Or if you're poor enough to really need to save a hundred bucks once a year, you probably qualify for freefile, probably have a really simple tax situation (1 or more W2s, end of story), and can file really quickly. Have you used an e-file program lately? It, much like a human accountant, asks a bunch of questions. Not sure what an AI could do differently, except fuck up and ask the wrong questions confidently once in a while. The US has some screwed up tax filing practices but throwing more magic at them would only make it worse. If AI does my taxes, who do I get mad at when it files it wrong and the IRS comes after me? Why are we even talking about AI to apply to a problem that really isn't particularly messy and is already easily solved by good data import and by a nest of ifs and elses maintained once a year by a team of programmers who can read tax laws? Like, we could make tax filing unnecessary tomorrow for most people with no AI, just by passing a law that allows the IRS to use the imported W2 data they already receive to compute and file default tax returns for most people who have simple tax situations. reply falcor84 13 hours agorootparentprevI recall imagining something s quite like this as a kid when I first encountered the term \"User Agent\".

While email spam still exists today, it was way, way, way, way worse before Gmail introduced bayesian spam filtering around that time. Today it's an occasional amusement. In those last days before spam filtering got a lot better it was reaching the point of seriously making it difficult to use email because the majority of your inbox was spam. The crazy part is it's really just this simple bayesian approach that solved like 95% of the problem. Simple math that already existed. Stuff that can be explained to a high schooler. No new crazy ML/AI, none of that. Just someone stepping back and pointing out \"hey, I think we can use this tool here....\" There was a lot more lower hanging fruit in those days. https://paulgraham.com/spam.html reply visarga 1 minute agorootparentI remember \"A plan for spam\", I implemented the algo myself, and it's my first contact with ML. chasd00 11 hours agorootparentprevseems like that would be very straightforward to the point that i could probably do it but maybe not in the most elegant way. I would be surprised if there wasn't a model on hugging face trained to identify the political leaning of some text. I bet it would be small enough to run locally, then it's a matter of creating a plugin/module or something that you add to your email client that runs on every new mail. Based on the result, move the email to your political spam folder. reply samus 11 hours agorootparentprevLLM is just quite compute-intensive. You could send emails to the OpenAI API to classify them as SPAM or HAM, but you'd probably cry at the bill. That should explain why it doesn't exist in free-tier accounts. Worry not, even in the event you belong to the GPU-poor, a beefy CPU should allow you to run a small LLM on your local machine. And if you find a good dataset for it, you can train the model in a Google Collab. reply kaibee 13 hours agorootparentprevI am endlessly frustrated every day that this is not a thing yet. I also don't want to send all of my emails to OpenAI though. reply jart 11 hours agorootparentYou can configure Postfix to filter content based on a shell script. https://www.postfix.org/FILTER_README.html You can turn the email into plain text from your shell script using links and then ask Mistral if it's spam or political: https://justine.lol/oneliners/#url You can use the grammar flag to force Mistral to only provide a YES or NO answer, which is easy to check from your script using an IF statement. Then boom, no more spam or politics. reply samus 12 hours agorootparentprevI recently did a Kaggle experiment and finetuned a LLM to classify SMS as SPAM or HAM. It was not so difficult; following the text classification example in the Hugginface transformers docs was enough. Without trying hard at all, accuracy was above 90%. Impressive even though even the messages marked as HAM seemed to be quite trash. The model itself was small - few hundred million parameters only. Models of this size run well on CPUs and an even smaller might have workd too. And non-neural classifiers might also do fine. You could do something similar and unleash it on your mailbox. The tricky part are integrations. At work, I don't even bother since interacting with the email system there is way more tricky than with GMail. reply smusamashah 10 hours agoprevShouldn't OpenAI be able to easily remove these non-complying GPTs by putting up their own GPT for moderation with a set of rules?

So what really happened? Most likely little quality control, garbage copy cats running around and now there is an insurmountable amount of spam. That is nothing like the quality of the Apple App Store. reply jart 11 hours agoparentIt was doomed from the start, because monetizable computing platforms that target consumers can't succeed if they don't have high barriers to entry. Low quality Atari games were responsible for the 1983 video game crash. Anyone could publish an Atari game. So what ended up happening was people made games about things like raping Native American women (Custer's Revenge) and they were sold just like any other Atari cartridge. Nintendo pioneered the closed platform. No one was allowed to build games for Nintendo without Nintendo's permission. Microsoft and Apple did things a bit differently, by making their platforms as difficult to develop for as possible. WIN32 is byzantine. Making iPhone apps when the App Store was launched required learning Objective C, which was an entirely new language to most developers at the time. OpenAI on the other hand created an app store which, in their own words, \"is simple and doesn't require any coding skills.\" https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store reply nextworddev 8 hours agorootparentYep.

They should scrap this failed idea and just give us MedQA, AlphaCode, etc. Specialized GPTs based on custom RAG or symbolic reasoning overlay or whatever, that actually do something that base GPT-4 can't do, in the sense of having an unmistakable step-change in quality for one type of task. reply ecronant 9 hours agoparentprevI think it has a fundamentally different problem. Any GPT I have tried, I could just ask chatGPT4 the same thing so I haven't bothered exploring much. I am still waiting to hear of a GPT that is obviously better than chatGPT4 by itself. Maybe it exists but I haven't heard of it. Short of GPT5 powered GPTs while I can only still talk directly to GPT4, I don't think I am going to be that impressed with anything using the chatGPT API compared to just asking chatGPT4 directly or using the API for my own needs. I don't need an interface for what I want to do with the API. ChatGPT4 can help me write that myself quite easily. I think the future looks much more like this than some app store knockoff. reply duskwuff 12 hours agoparentprev [–] > So what really happened? Most likely little quality control, garbage copy cats running around and now there is an insurmountable amount of spam. That, and there isn't a lot of space for real innovation within the \"GPT\" framework that OpenAI provides. Most of what's available in their store is literally just prepackaged prompts, and there's only so much that can accomplish. You can ask a chatbot to pretend to be an expert in a topic all day, but that won't actually make it into one. If Apple's App Store were just a form you filled out to release versions of Flappy Bird with new graphics or whatever, that'd fail too. Developers need conceptual \"space\" to innovate; I'm not convinced that's possible when the interface (a chat window) and the back end (a language model) are both set in stone by the platform. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Secure Local Development with lcl.host's Easy HTTPS Setup",
    "originLink": "https://anchor.dev/blog/introducing-lcl-host",
    "originBody": "Today we are launching lcl.host, a free devtool for web developers to quickly setup & use HTTPS locally. With lcl.host, you get a secure browser context in development that matches your production environment. Eliminate mixed asset issues, CORS errors, and secure cookie misconfiguration before they cause problems in production. Read more about the benefits of using HTTPS in development, and give it a try: it only takes 2 minutes to switch your app to HTTPS. Why We Built lcl.host Anchor provides managed private certificate authorities (CAs) for internal TLS. As both a security product and hosted SaaS application, we put a lot of effort into secure application development. From handling the private keys that sign certificates, to managing fine-grained access credentials in the dashboard, we take a rigorous approach to secure development on all layers of our stack. Keeping our development, staging, and production environments in sync (aka dev/prod parity) helps to prevent bugs that would otherwise only show up in production. For full dev/prod parity, we use HTTPS to get a secure browser context, not just the secure-ish special case localhost browser context. Before building lcl.host, we used self-signed app.localhost certificates, but those have a few downsides: All team members had to manually provision (and re-provision) their own self-signed certificates. The self-signed certificates had to be manually added to each trust store on the system app.localhost domains don't work everywhere, so /etc/hosts entries or a development DNS server were required for non-browser clients (like curl). Running apps in local containers required constant certificate re-provisioning and trust store updates. Since we already used Anchor private CAs internally between development services, we knew it could solve some of these problems. But a private CA alone is not a complete solution. So we built lcl.host, and we think it’s the best way to setup and use HTTPS with your apps in development: ACME-powered automated certificate provisioning and renewal instead of troublesome manual processes. Hostnames that just work everywhere, with no custom configuration required. The same secure browser context to match production, without the browser quirks in the localhost context. Works well inside, outside, and even between containers (thanks to Anchor’s powerful packages features). Fast setup and batteries included, no certificate or encryption expertise required. We’re excited to share it with you! To setup HTTPS in development, install the Anchor CLI toolchain, run anchor lcl, and follow the instructions. That’s it! $ brew install anchordotdev/tap/anchor $ anchor lcl Or install from source if Homebrew isn't an option. Loading... Use lcl.host to add HTTPS to a Next.js app How lcl.host Works lcl.host combines an Anchor managed private CA for your personal development environment, the lcl.host DNS zone to resolve subdomains to your local system, and the Anchor CLI to manage your local trust stores. Personalized Private CA When you sign up for an Anchor account, we automatically provision a “localhost” CA for you. This dedicated private CA provides portability between development environments and remains 100% free to use with an unlimited number of development apps. This CA has some restrictions though: it can only issue certificates for subdomains of lcl.host and localhost, but that’s all you need for local development. The anchor lcl mkcert command is the easiest way to get development certificates using Anchor's zero-challenge ACME flow. Other ACME client tools like certbot and acme.sh work well too, but we recommend integrating an ACME client into your application to allow automatic certificate provisioning and renewal. Don't worry, we will walk you through that too when you run anchor lcl setup. lcl.host DNS Zone All lcl.host subdomains resolve to 127.0.0.1, the same address as localhost. These subdomains work without HTTPS too, making them a drop-in replacement for localhost. To use them with HTTPS you will need a certificate for the subdomain that is trusted by your system. Your personal CA handles the first part, and the Anchor CLI takes care of your system's trust stores. Trust Stores A trust store manages a set of root certificates (aka trust anchors) which browsers and other clients use to verify certificates presented by servers. Some trust stores are integrated into the operating system (Keychain on MacOS), others are file/directory based (/etc/ssl/certs/ on Debian systems), or even a custom database format (like certdb for NSS/Firefox). Keeping every trust store up to date used to be a lot of recurring manual work, but the Anchor CLI automates the whole process. After signing in, the Anchor CLI fetches the list of expected CA certificates for your development environment, checks for them in your local trust stores, and walks you through any required changes. After this quick and easy install, your certificates will be trusted everywhere on your system. There's a lot that's required to setup HTTPS in development. The magic of lcl.host is that it's all handled for you, so you can get back to building secure apps that work seamlessly in development and production. Try Now Install the Anchor CLI and run anchor lcl from your application directory, and have local HTTPS in no time!",

It's probably that they didn't think about it when they wrote the code, but now they know and hopefully this gets fixed in the next release? reply mholt 17 hours agorootparentYeah, exactly.

Mozilla bricked SSL certificates that are mandatory for everything, including Browser Extensions. There is a flag for about:config to unbrick it. Problem is though, that this lasts less than a second because of the remote settings service running in a loop. If you block that services domain with a host firewall (like opensnitch), Firefox will do an endless for loop using 100% CPU load trying to request the shavar and other services domains. So, effectively, you cannot run an old Firefox version, and especially not a version that uses the old bundled mozilla certificate (which is all provided download variants).

The parent project, lcl.host, has some annoying restrictions: > This CA has some restrictions though: it can only issue certificates for subdomains of lcl.host and localhost, but that’s all you need for local development. Localias, on the other hand, lets you use any custom domain you'd like. And if you use a domain ending in .local, it will broadcast over mDNS so that you can easily connect to that server from any other device on your wifi network (like your phone.) Localias also allows you to share your configuration with your entire development team by committing a .localias.yaml file to the root of your git repo. This makes sharing links with each other super convenient. Always nice to see another competitor in the space; if you're interested in this, please check out Localias as well!

Localias wraps Caddy to handle all the cert provision; I believe Caddy uses mkcert.

I had my eye on Caddy for a local reverse proxy but can't be doing with maintaining another big config file. With the labels method the reverse proxy becomes \"set and forget\" and you're probably going to be editing bundled compose files to get rid of port conflicts anyway (or using override like https://blog.gpkb.org/posts/multiple-web-projects-traefik/) reply dspillett 19 hours agoprevIt surprises me how few people dev/test against HTTPS, given that it isn't exactly hard to setup manually (with tools like this making it even easier). Just point a wildcard DNS entry at 127.0.0.1 or some other useful address if your dev copy is actually not that local, and chuck a web server there acting as a proxy to what-ever apps, with a LetsEncrypt wildcard cert. It isn't zero work, but saves time in the long run as soon as you hit unexpected issues caused by small differences between dev and prod. reply zikduruqe 19 hours agoparentYou don't even need to mess with a wildcard from Lets Encrypt, just use https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert reply dspillett 18 hours agorootparentI've always been a bit wary of a local trusted CA, especially with the signing cert on the same dev box as the certificates it signs which is how I've seen things done a lot. It feels like opening up a trust issue that could allow an uncooperative entity to play games with me… Maybe that is just paranoia from the practical jokes played back in CompSci at Uni! Admittedly an external attacker getting close enough to sign a cert using such a CA, in order to trick me into something, means they probably have such high access already that they don't really need the CA to do that or worse, so perhaps it is unnecessary caution. reply nucleardog 17 hours agorootparentThe way I handle this in the dev tooling I put together is to run a totally separate browser profile that (1) trusts the certificate and (2) can only connect to localhost. It also launches with a totally different colour scheme. With chrome, that's something like: google-chrome --user-data-dir=\"${HOME}/.config/ourlocaldev/google-chrome\" --install-autogenerated-theme=85,63,9 --host-rules=\"MAP * 127.0.0.1, EXCLUDE localhost, EXCLUDE fonts.googleapis.com, EXCLUDE fonts.gstatic.com\" --ignore-certificate-errors-spki-list=\"0oKw9nasIS7qRQD1CYXe5bmi22/mnHjZP++f6G+VM88=\" \"https://my.dev.thing\" This will launch a separate copy of chrome with a fresh/separate profile. It will have a different colour (RGB values set in there) so it's visually distinct when it's running and I don't get the windows mixed up. Any request made from the browser will be rewritten to connect to 127.0.0.1 (except a couple google font domains). The danger if someone got their hands on my local key/cert is basically nil. They would only be able to MITM connections from this one specific browser window to localhost. And that browser is incapable of connecting to anything besides localhost. I can never accidentally open my banking site in there. Also fresh profile so no saved passwords, credit cards, or anything else. (As an added benefit, I don't really need to worry about reconfiguring URLs for projects. If I open \"testing.mysite.com\" in that browser, it will force the connection to localhost, so I can just run my services at our test URLs and steal configs as-is from the testing environment. Taking it further, I then have a controller set up in k3s/Rancher Desktop that rewrites the service on all annotated ingresses to point to its own service, which runs nginx, which the controller then configures to proxy the requests on to the local service or the actual upstream testing service depending on whether the local container is running. It also configures CoreDNS to point the upstream URLs at the same proxy. End result is that from the browser or anything running in k3s you can hit our testing URLs and it will hit your local container if it's running or fall back to the testing environment if not.) If you want to try the browser thing, you can generate the fingerprint for a certificate with: echo \"\"openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -prexit 2>/dev/nullopenssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in /dev/stdinopenssl pkey -pubin -outform deropenssl dgst -sha256 -binaryopenssl enc -base64 reply djbusby 14 hours agorootparentThis is an awesome trick, thanks, I'm copying you. reply dpkirchner 9 hours agorootparentprevI figure you could create the CA, have your browser trust it, create and sign your localhost cert, and then nuke the CA private key so no other carts may be signed. It'd be annoying if you need to make a new localhost certificate, but totally manageable. reply javajosh 8 hours agorootparentprevYou don't even need that. See https://simpatico.io/devops/deploy.sh#generateSelfSignedCert() and also #generateRootCA() Then point your server to the output files. If you want, you can also modify `/etc/hosts` to point a \"production name\" to localhost (something I actually don't do and never wrote a script for). Far fewer moving parts than the OP. (parts of Simpatico uses subtle.crypto and so requires https to run even locally) reply afavour 18 hours agoparentprev> It surprises me how few people dev/test against HTTPS For dev at least it’s mostly because web browsers treat localhost as a special domain that gets the HTTPS treatment even when loaded over HTTP. I have set up local HTTPS certs before now, can’t remember exactly what required it. But I still load most web projects on localhost over HTTP just out of habit. reply hk1337 17 hours agorootparentI've always thought the need for local HTTPS was unnecessary for at least 90% of the projects and brought no real value other than making the developer \"feel\" better. localhost with HTTP should be sufficient for most things. It's when you start doing stuff like \"app.localhost\" like what was mentioned in the article which, despite it having \"localhost\" is not the same as http://localhost. Develop basic in local and do all the hostname + https on actual server where you can easily do something like letsencrypt route DNS to it. reply chuckadams 17 hours agorootparentThere are a number of APIs, such as geolocation, that only work over https. It's also very common to accidentally generate non-https urls for assets, which is a bug most people would rather catch in local dev and not production when the browser refuses to fetch them. I use traefik to serve my apps in dev, which generates self-signed certs by default if you don't hook it up to ACME. Slightly more cumbersome because it means clicking through a warning screen and disabling verification in CLI tools (actually those are where I do drop to plain http). I'm sure this lcl.host product smooths this process considerably, but when it comes to local dev tools, I have an absolute requirement that they actually run locally and don't tether me to some cloud service, so I'll be sticking with traefik regardless for now. reply afavour 17 hours agorootparent> There are a number of APIs, such as geolocation, that only work over https And localhost https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure... reply ifwinterco 14 hours agorootparentMight have changed, but last time I tried to use the Clipboard API it didn't work on localhost without https reply umvi 13 hours agorootparentI would be very surprised if that were the case. Localhost gets special privileges in most browsers reply knallfrosch 15 hours agoparentprevIt is hard to set up. Creating a cert and trusting it is easy – a Powershell script can do that in 3 lines. But then, trouble begins. You have to configure every server to use the certificate (or use a proxy) and every client to accept the certificate. Sometimes the proxies eat headers, or they have trouble with WebSockets and hot reloading or whatever. We also use IPs instead of domains to find our locally running prod servers so that our customers don't have to configure anything DNS on their maybe-offline WiFi network. We also have to test with external devices, such as iPads. How do you automate getting your certificate onto them? ..And then your IP changes and all is lost again. Yeah, if you have a 50 line Svelte \"app\" that you serve as site it's easy. But who does that? reply holoduke 13 hours agoparentprevI never work locally. Always remote. Dev.xxx.com, stg.xxx.com etc reply austin-cheney 13 hours agoprevSome things I learned about trusted localhost HTTPS: * Windows is the easiest... by far. There is only one trust store and its extremely easy to access at different levels of trust. Firefox has its own trust store so you can either add your certs to both the Windows store AND the Firefox trust store or flip a config in Firefox to tell it to use the Windows trust store like everyone else. * Linux is a challenge because you have to add your certificates to the OS trust store and then each browser has their own trust stores. * MacOS is pretty close to impossible, at least fully automated. If the cert is not registered with a third party of the OS's choosing the cert will not be trusted in the browser. The way around this is to manually add your localhost cert chain to the MacOS keychain. If anybody wants an example here is something I wrote a ways back in JS (but please be warned its specific to my application: * Build the certificate chain - https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems/blob/master... * Install the cert by OS type - https://github.com/prettydiff/share-file-systems/blob/master... That second sample also installs pcap so that I can serve on localhost over ports 80/443. reply mdavid626 24 minutes agoprevThey lost me at \"Signin to Anchor.dev\". reply BroomOfSYS 19 hours agoprevHow is this different from something like Caddy which supports https://localhost instead of something like https://lcl.host reply its_stolt 18 hours agoparentlocalhost gives you a different security context in your browser than using a full domain name. Typically to use a full domain name locally you'd either need to mess with /etc/hosts (which can bite you later) or mess with DNS. lcl.host just makes things work out of the box. reply its_stolt 18 hours agorootparentLet me add a bit of clarification here, since you specifically asked about https://localhost Using http with localhost is a mostly security context, but it has some quirks[0]. Using https://localhost will give you the full security context but then you're typically stuck either dealing with certs manually or using a proxy, like caddy. lcl.host should simplify your setup. We're big fans of caddy by the way and even sponsor the project. Matt's doing amazing work over there. [0] https://web.dev/articles/when-to-use-local-https reply mholt 18 hours agorootparentThanks! That reminds me we need to get your logo on our new homepage. I'll shoot you an email. reply mholt 18 hours agoprevI want to point out that Anchor.dev sponsors the Caddy project and we're very grateful for that! Anchor devs have also made code contributions to Caddy and CertMagic. Anchor has a neat product. They're making internal TLS more accessible to more developers who don't necessarily need a separate web server. They're doing local TLS just about as best as possible from what I can see. IMO this has more utility than mkcert -- which is a great tool by Filippo and Caddy shares some of its underlying library for its own auto-trusted internal CA -- because, like Caddy, Anchor fully automates the certificates instead of just generating them and needing a cron job. It's more hands-off and higher-level, allowing you to get more done with less effort. reply blopker 18 hours agoprevI don't see OrbStack mentioned here much, but it's completely replaced Docker Desktop for me.

Is there any risk to just publishing a globally valid wildcard cert for *.lcl.host, since it always resolves to 127.0.0.1 anyway? reply benburkert 17 hours agoparentWe install the CA certificates into the trust stores so that the certificates are trusted by your browsers and clients, otherwise they will (rightfully!) get connection errors. We also set the CAA records for all lcl.host subdomains to anchor.dev, so no public CA will issue certificates for *.lcl.host. The only valid certs for lcl.host subdomains you will encounter are for your account's CAs. If we gave everyone a cert+key for *.lcl.host, besides the security concerns, we'd have to keep redistributing them every ~45 days, but with lcl.host you can setup ACME to automatically renew certs before they expire. reply 8organicbits 17 hours agoparentprevSome sites have tried this before, but I dont think they stay online long. The certificates are \"leaked\" when they are shared, so the CA will revoke them. I think a better approach is to get a domain name and a Let's Encrypt certificate. There's lots of tooling for this, and it matches production. I built https://www.getlocalcert.net/ to act as free, Let's Encrypt compatible subdomain service specifically for these sorts of challenges. reply extraduder_ire 17 hours agorootparentCool. I was hoping something like this existed, and glad to see you got it into the public suffix list. I'd been considering doing something like it for some time. reply jpambrun 14 hours agoprevI have another personal solution [0]. It's a DNS server that also gets a wildcard certificate and make it available with a secret. This is definitely in the convenience over security relm, but it resolve any pattern prefix-123-123-123-123-suffix.example.com to the enclosed ip (e.g. 123.123.123.123). It will resolve to 127.0.0.1 or any other ip happily. Now you just need to use the associated cert and enjoy https. Works great from with k8s ingress, caddy, node..

Yes, it exposes globally, but that's often convenient to share a link to my dev with colleagues. And it has been fast enough. Downside is that you need internet connectivity. reply d_meeze 14 hours agoprevI’m skimming the docs looking for how “in containers” is handled and so far I can only see a one liner in the release notes. One problem in local environments I keep having and building tricks for is for services inside containers getting certs for other containers. From within the container, resolving to 127.0.0.1 isn’t helpful as that’s the internal loopback not the host. reply benburkert 13 hours agoparentwe're going to say more about how lcl.host works between containers in the future since it ends up pulling in Anchor's package features, but I can give a quick rundown of what we've done in the past with docker-compose: start a service in container A and expose port 44300, and configure the service with an ACME client to provision a `service-a.lcl.host` certificate. The clients in that container won't trust the cert, but that no problem, since your system/browser will trust the cert if you've run `anchor lcl`. In container B, install an anchor built package for the language of the server, and setup the HTTPS/TLS client to use the set of CAs in that package. Now app B can connect to `service-a.lcl.host:443300` over HTTPS/TLS. reply d_meeze 13 hours agorootparent“Clients in that container won’t trust the cert”. Yeah, there’s the trick. “service-a.lcl.host:443300“ so when inside the container, won’t that resolve to 127.0.0.1 which is the container internal loopback interface not the docker host’s interface? Hence trying to connect to itself not its sibling. reply benburkert 13 hours agorootparentright it's the loopback, but I believe docker-compose can forward loopback ports to the host (and then back into the other container) using links, but i'm fuzzy on the details and may be misremembering. reply jbverschoor 14 hours agoprevJust use orbstack, it gives you https and hostnames.

I've spent the last 6 months building a static analyzer that mostly uses ASTs and couldn't understand what you were offering after skimming the readme until I saw this link. Now I'm thinking of how I could integrate something like this into my analyzer to simplify the implementation of some of the simpler rules. reply herrington_d 12 hours agoparentprevthanks for mentioning ast-grep! reply bilekas 9 hours agoprevThis looks really interesting, especially the GritQL side of things, I remember playing around with doing something simular on a much smaller and tailored use-case so I have an idea how much effort is involved here, but seems like a really great idea to introduce a query language to move things smoother. Great work, can't wait to play around. reply CJefferson 3 hours agoprevNormally I wouldn't suggest this, but have you considered integrating with AIs? One tool I've been looking for (and I wonder if this is such a tool?) is something that can do things like rename variables in functions to \"more sensible names\". Now, it's not hard to get ChatGPT to read a function and suggest new names for variables, but if you ask it to also do the substitutions, there is an annoyingly high chance it break the function in the process. reply worldsayshi 2 hours agoparentI suspect that ChatGPT would be quite challenged trying to write code in any language that wasn't part of its training data. So a DSL that was just released would be a challenge. Worth trying out though. Perhaps rule creation can be turned into function calls so it wouldn't need to understand new syntax. reply mdaniel 12 hours agoprevapologies if this should be a discussion/issue/whatever but: Do you envision going up against CodeQL and/orby making semantic information available to the ast nodes? OT1H, I can imagine it could be an overwhelming increase in project scope, but OTOH it could also truly lead to some stunning transformation patterns e.g. https://github.com/github/codeql/blob/v1.27.0/java/ql/exampl... or even more \"textual\" semantics such as var foo = \"hello\".substring(1); // knowing \"foo\" is a String Since you already have GitLab on your docs page, if I could pay for CodeQL over on GL that would be a game changer IMHO reply morgante 12 hours agoparentOne of the specific design goals we had was to make sure that the query engine isn't tightly coupled to AST nodes. We started with the AST, since that's ultimately the foundation for code but the goal is to add more graphs on top. So you could do a query like this to find all cases where a function called `unsafe` is queried with an unknown value: `unsafe($val)` where $val method is a call to S::method, which seems like it is somewhat less useful for several kinds of rewrites I'm interested in. (One of the main things I keep playing around with in my head is converting a C codebase into C++ by converting its ad-hoc vtable implementation into regular C++ virtual methods.) reply morgante 9 hours agoparentWe don't have semantic information yet (it's on the roadmap), but in many cases it's sufficient to get that information from the AST by looking where the variable was originally defined. For example: https://app.grit.io/studio?key=TteyWLNGZGWFIC9EOiCRi `$x.old($arg)` => `$x.new(\"method\", _, $arg)` where { $programDoes the rewrite code also have to be syntactically correct or is that a simple text replacement because that's what I see as the main impediment; if I'm using the sqlite grammar to parse and produce postgresql output, the output won't conform to the grammar. No, we don't require the output code to be syntactically correct. You can use the raw`code` modified to indicate a raw text replacement: https://docs.grit.io/language/patterns#raw-output > Also how do I dynamically load custom tree-sitter grammars like in ast-grep? We don't currently support dynamically loading grammars, mainly because our metavariable approach requires some modifications to the grammar. reply snthpy 3 hours agorootparentThank you.

    "title": "Bug Fix: Btrfs Filesystem Corruption Solved",
    "originLink": "https://tavianator.com/2024/btrfs_bug.html",
    "originBody": "Bug hunting in Btrfs 2024-03-18 Tavian Barnes The other day I was implementing multi-threaded stat() calls in bfs. When I ran some benchmarks, I saw something that made my heart skip a beat: $ tailfin run bench/bench.sh --build=main --default ... bfs: error: bench/corpus/chromium/v8/src/heap/heap.cc: Structure needs cleaning If you're not familiar, \"structure needs cleaning\" is the human-readable description of EUCLEAN, an errno value that usually indicates filesystem corruption. Fearing the worst, I checked dmesg and saw $ dmesgtail ... BTRFS critical (device dm-2): corrupted node, root=518 block=16438782945911875046 owner mismatch, have 4517169229596899607 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] I immediately rebooted into a live environment and ran btrfs check, but to my surprise, there were no errors found. btrfs scrub also found no evidence of corruption. And in fact, the file from the error message was completely fine. Whatever the issue was, it seemed to have gone away on its own. I searched Google for that \"corrupted node\" message and found that it had happened to someone else recently too: Linus Torvalds, just after merging a Btrfs pull request. (This was not the first time Linus and I had hit the same bug. We both have the same CPU in our desktops. Last time it led to one of my favourite bugfixes ever.) But the difference between me and Linus was that I could (semi-)reliably reproduce the error. Not every time, but maybe 10% of the time I ran bfs with parallel stat() calls on a large directory tree, I would see that \"structure needs cleaning\" error. I reported my findings to the Btrfs mailing list, and though it led to some discussion about potential causes, we didn't narrow down the root cause. extent_buffer Based on the logs, the Btrfs developers assumed the problem had to do allocation of struct extent_buffer and their memory pages. I'm not a Btrfs internals expert by any means, but I understand that extent_buffers are used for metadata I/O; that is, reading and writing B-tree nodes. An extent_buffer is associated with an array of struct folio/struct page (depending on kernel version), and those pages hold the actual contents of the extents that are read or written. The abstraction helps with file system block sizes that are different from the system page size. Allocating an extent_buffer and its pages is more complicated than you might expect. Each struct extent_buffer holds an array of struct folio, and those folios have a private reference that points back to the extent_buffer. There should only ever be one extent_buffer at a time for any particular extent. To reduce locking on the allocation path, the extent_buffer and the corresponding folios are allocated separately, linked together, and then inserted into a radix tree keyed by the start offset of the extent. Only the radix tree insertion needs locking. At the point of insertion, if it turns out someone else beat us to allocating the same extent, we instead take an extra reference to that extent_buffer and free the one we just allocated (and its pages). This code path had undergone some churn recently, both changing the race detection/handling strategy and converting from struct page to struct folio, so there was suspicion that a race or reference counting bug had crept in. But the extra debug logging didn't show it. It appeared that the extent_buffer and the folios had all the right reference counts, but the memory itself had garbage rather than the appropriate on-disk contents. Btrfs does some sanity checks after reading these blocks in, and those checks were failing, causing the errors. But the on-disk blocks themselves were fine, and the next time we read them in, everything worked. git bisect bad One of the best bug hunting tools for the Linux kernel is git bisect. Unfortunately, bisecting bugs like this is challenging. For intermittent issues, it's easy enough to know when to mark a commit bad, but harder to know if a commit is good—maybe the bug just hasn't triggered yet. You also need a known-good commit to start from, but that was hard to find. I thought at first the bug was new in Linux 6.7, but I could still reproduce it on 6.6 and 6.5. The Btrfs devs suggested I start from 6.0. Bisecting can also be dangerous because you are running arbitrary old mid-development-cycle kernel commits that may have since had bugs fixed in the official releases. It's safer to do it from a virtual machine, but so far I had been unable to reproduce the bug on a VM. So started bisecting on my actual desktop. Normally I would be far too scared to bisect a filesystem corruption bug on my actual computer that I use daily. But this seemed like it wasn't \"real\" corruption, plus I have backups, so I risked it. Unfortunately, after a couple rounds, I ran into actual, on-disk filesystem corruption. 2,073,625 uncorrectable read errors is a new record for me, so I was too scared to continue the bisect. I restored what I could from backups and carried on with my life. tracefs A few weeks later, Btrfs developer Qu Wenruo got back to me with some extra debugging patches and I decided to give it another shot. I ran his patch on bare metal, but wasn't able to reproduce the bug with the debugging patch applied. Such is life when debugging race conditions! I also tried again to reproduce the issue in a VM. I configured it to more closely match my actual system configuration: multiple disks with dm-crypt full disk encryption, joined together in a Btrfs RAID 0 array. And I made them emulated NVME drives instead of VirtIO. That did the trick: I could now reproduce the issue in a VM, though it took around 30 runs of my reproducer instead of the ~10 it took in real life. But this time I could still reproduce it with the debugging patch applied. After a couple runs and tweaking the trace messages to make cross-referencing easier, I noticed something odd. Looking at just the lines from the trace corresponding to the \"corrupted\" error message, I saw this: $ grep 'eb=15302115328' dmesg.log BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=258 block=15302115328 owner mismatch, have 13709377558419367261 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=15302115328 iou-wrk--173727 15..... 2649295481us : alloc_extent_buffer: alloc_extent_buffer: alloc eb=15302115328 len=16384 kworker/-322 15..... 2649295735us : end_bbio_meta_read: read done, eb=15302115328 page_refs=3 eb level=0 fsid=b66a67f0-8273-4158-b7bf-988bb5683000 kworker/-5095 31..... 2649295941us : end_bbio_meta_read: read done, eb=15302115328 page_refs=8 eb level=0 fsid=b66a67f0-8273-4158-b7bf-988bb5683000 The only relevant operations seem to be allocating this extent_buffer, and then reading it ... twice. Reading it once ought to be enough, I thought, so I looked more closely at the code that actually reads them in and managed to eyeball the bug. read_extent_buffer_pages() Just like how multiple threads might try to allocate the same extent_buffer at the same time, they might also try to read it at the same time. To ensure the read only happens once, a custom locking protocol is used: int read_extent_buffer_pages(struct extent_buffer *eb, /* ... */) { if (test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags)) return 0; /* ... */ /* Someone else is already reading the buffer, just wait for it. */ if (test_and_set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags)) goto done; /* ... */ bbio = btrfs_bio_alloc(INLINE_EXTENT_BUFFER_PAGES, REQ_OP_READREQ_META, eb->fs_info, end_bbio_meta_read, eb); /* ... */ btrfs_submit_bio(bbio, mirror_num); done: if (wait == WAIT_COMPLETE) { wait_on_bit_io(&eb->bflags, EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE); if (!test_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_UPTODATE, &eb->bflags)) return -EIO; } return 0; } static void end_bbio_meta_read(struct btrfs_bio *bbio) { /* ... */ bool uptodate = !bbio->bio.bi_status; /* ... */ if (uptodate) { set_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb); } else { clear_extent_buffer_uptodate(eb); set_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READ_ERR, &eb->bflags); } /* ... */ clear_bit(EXTENT_BUFFER_READING, &eb->bflags); smp_mb__after_atomic(); wake_up_bit(&eb->bflags, EXTENT_BUFFER_READING); /* ... */ } The logic is intended to work like this: read_extent_buffer_pages() { if (test_bit(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set_bit(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on_bit_io(READING); return 0; } end_bbio_meta_read() { set_bit(UPTODATE); clear_bit(READING); wake_up_bit(READING); } read_extent_buffer_pages() { if (test_bit(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set_bit(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on_bit_io(READING); return 0; } Unfortunately, this locking protocol has a bug: if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; set(UPTODATE); clear(READING); wake_up(READING); if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; If the first thread starts and finishes the I/O between the second thread checking the UPTODATE bit and the READING bit, the second thread will start a totally unnecessary read even though we already read in the extent. Worse, because the UPTODATE bit is already set, the third will return without waiting for the read to complete. That thread will then think it's safe to access the extent_buffer's pages, despite them currently being under I/O, leading to a data race! The fix is to use double-checked locking: after setting the READING bit, check UPTODATE again so we don't kick off more useless (actively harmful, even) I/O. if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; if (test(UPTODATE)) goto wake; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; end_bbio: set(UPTODATE); wake: clear(READING); wake_up(READING); if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; if (test(UPTODATE)) goto wake; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; end_bbio: set(UPTODATE); wake: clear(READING); wake_up(READING); if (test(UPTODATE)) return 0; if (test_and_set(READING)) goto done; if (test(UPTODATE)) goto wake; btrfs_submit_bio(); done: wait_on(READING); return 0; end_bbio: set(UPTODATE); wake: clear(READING); wake_up(READING); I submitted a patch that adds this missing check, as well as a couple cleanup patches. With that fix, I can run the reproducer overnight without triggering any more errors. Epilogue You might be surprised that this race was not benign. After all, we're reading some disk blocks into memory that already holds the contents of those same disk blocks. It's still technically a data race to read and write memory at the same time, even if the writes don't modify the memory, but usually it would be unobservable in practice. uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory The reason I could observe it was already mentioned above: full disk encryption. When dm-crypt processes a disk read, it reads the encrypted contents into memory and then decrypts them in-place. uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory uninitialized memory It's obvious why this causes problems: sometimes the racing thread will see valid metadata, but sometimes it will see encrypted bytes that appear totally random. I even captured a trace where the error messages show the extent being gradually filled in: [ 807.737576] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted node, root=266 block=3178470954007437077 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064 [ 807.751913] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=266 block=12738904064 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064 [ 807.800898] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupted leaf, root=266 block=12738904064 owner mismatch, have 6155297726051334641 expect [256, 18446744073709551360] eb=ffff8ac915d022d0 start=12738904064 There you can see the same block switch from an internal node to a leaf, and the block number change from a random number to the start of the extent, over about 0.02 seconds.",

That widget had a bug, prevented it displaying a new message when it was in the middle of an animation, which effectively ate messages related to LDAP (Your password will expire in X days, etc.). Also we needed a keyboard selector in that window, which was absent. I gave heads up to the GDM team, they sent a “go ahead” as a reply. I have written an elaborate patch, which they rejected and wanted a simpler one. I iterated the way they wanted, they said it passes the muster and will be merged.

Now obviously if the complaining involves requiring people to work for some feature you want, that's entitled and wack. Same goes for throwing a fit because maintainers went for systemd instead of your own favorite init system. But being open source doesn't mean people shouldn't or can't just say \"this is bad\" or \"don't use x\" or even \"this X feature doesn't work when using Y\" (now If what they are saying isn't true, sure we should call them out) It's normal and in fact I think it should be encouraged, as not everyone can be aware of potential problems they could have with a piece of OSS that is already known in some obscure dev mailing list.

We weren't using btrfs anyway (for data drives) and it definitely was not cheap. But storage never is. But again, most systems are not like that. Kubernetes cluster nodes? Reimage at will. Compute nodes for vms backed by SAN? Reimage at will. Btrfs can actually make that reimage faster and it's pretty reliable on a single flash drive so why not? reply wongarsu 16 hours agorootparentprevMy impression of btrfs is that it's very useful and stable if you stay away from the sharp edges. Until you run into some random scenario that leads you to an unrecoverable file system. But it has been that way for now 14 years. Sure, there are far fewer sharp edges now than there were back then. For a host you can just reimage it's fine, for a well-tested fairly restricted system it's fine. I stay far away from it for personal computers and my home-built NAS, because just about any other fs seems to be more stable. reply nolist_policy 18 hours agorootparentprevYou do you.

This is drastic, and I'd rather perform such an operation on an image copy. This is one case where ZFS is absolutely superior; if a drive goes offline, and is returned to a set at a later date, the resilver only touches the changed/needed blocks. Btrfs forces the entire filesystem to be rewritten in a rebalance, which is much more drastic.

I understand the point you're trying to make here, but 1000 is just an incredibly unrealistically small number if we're modelling bugs like that. The real number might be on the order of millions.

I'm not a filesystem developer, I'm a user: as a user, I don't care about the long tail, I only care about the average case as it relates to my deployment size. As you correctly point out, my deployment is of negligible size, and the long tail is far far beyond my reach. Aside: your hypothetical event has a 0.1% chance of happening each hour. That means it has a 99.9% chance of not happening each hour. The odds it doesn't happen after 100 hours is 0.999^100, or 90.5%.

No, that's not how probabilities work at all for a bug that happens with uniform probability (i.e. not bugs that deterministically happen after n hours since boot). If you have millions of users, some of them will hit it within hours or even minutes after boot! > As you correctly point out, my deployment is of negligible size, and the long tail is far far beyond my reach.

The 1000 number came from you. I have no idea where you got it from. I suspect the \"real number\" is several orders of magnitude higher, but I have no idea, and it's sort of artificial in the first place. My overarching point is that mine is such a vanishingly small portion of the universe of machines running btrfs that I am virtually guaranteed that bugs will be found and fixed before they affect me, exactly as happened here. Unless you run a rather large business, that's probably true for you too. The filesystem with the most users has the least bugs.

Nobody dies when their filesystem gets corrupted. Nobody even loses money, unless they've been negligent. I don't know what to say to that other than that I wish I had your optimism on reliable system design practices across various industries. Maybe there's a parallel universe where people treat every file system as having an error rate of something like \"data corruption/loss once every four days\", but it's not the one I'm familiar with. For better or worse, the bar for file system reliability is much, much, much, much higher than anything you could reasonably produce empirical data for unless you're operating at Google/AWS etc. scale. reply jcalvinowens 12 hours agorootparent> \"I've experienced 100 error-free hours, so this is a non-issue for me and my users\" It's a statement of fact: it has been a non-issue for me.

Also, no users, just me. \"Proabably okay\" is more than good enough for me, and I'm sure many people have similar requirements (clearly not you). I have no optimism, just no empathy for the negligent: I learned my lesson with backups a long time ago. Some people blame the filesystem instead of their backup practices when their data is corrupted, but I think that's naive. The filesystem did you a favor, fix your shit.

You're missing the forest for the trees here. It is predictive ON AVERAGE. I don't care about the worst case like you do: I only care about the expected case. If I died when my filesystem got corrupted... I would hope it's obvious I wouldn't approach it this way. Adding to this: my laptop has this btrfs bug right now. I'm not going to do anything about it, because it's not worth 20 minutes of my time to rebuild my kernel for a bug that is unlikely to bite before I get the fix in 6.9-rc1, and would only cost me 30 minutes of time in the worst case if it did.

Also, if you don't mind sharing your kconfig that would be interesting to see too. reply tavianator 18 hours agorootparentNo, but I may have been missing some debugging CONFIGs. I was just using the stock Arch kconfig. I did submit a patch to add a WARN_ON() for this case: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/d4a055317bdb8ecbd7e6d9bd... But to catch the general class of bugs you'd need something like KCSAN. I did try that but the kernel is not KCSAN-clean so it was hard to know if any reports were relevant. reply jcalvinowens 16 hours agorootparentThe WARN is great. Something as general as KCSAN isn't necessary: it's a classic ABA problem, double checking the ->bflags value on transitions is sufficient to catch it. Like a lockdep-style thing where *_bit() are optionally replaced by helpers that check the current value and WARN if the transition is unexpected. Using the event numbering from your patch description, such a thing would have flagged seeing UPTODATE at (2). But the space of invalid transitions is is much larger than the space of valid ones, which is why I think it might help catch other future bugs sooner. Dunno if it's actually worth it, but I definitely recall bugs of this flavor in the past. It'll take some work to unearth them all, alas... reply tavianator 16 hours agorootparentI like that idea, but it isn't really compatible with my fix. `bflags` still makes the same transitions, I just skip the actual read in the `UPTODATEREADING` case. reply jcalvinowens 15 hours agorootparentI think after your fix the set of valid states in that spot would just include UPTODATE.

No quotas and no compression, but it was indeed openSUSE! reply nolist_policy 15 hours agorootparentThat explains it, because openSUSE uses snapshots and quotas by default. It creates a snapshot before and one after every package manager interaction and cleans up old snapshots once per day. Unfortunately, deleting snapshots with quotas is an expensive operation that needs to rescan some structures to keep the quota information consistent and that is what you're seeing. reply Daunk 15 hours agorootparentI'm not sure that's correct. When you install openSUSE (this was a clean install) there's a checkbox that asks if you want snapshots, which I did not enable.

And all hardware components changed at least once during the fileystsen lifetime. Worst corruption was when one DIMM started corrupting data. As a result computer kept crashing and eventually refused to mount because of btrfs checksum mismatches. Fix was to buy new HW. Then run btrfs filesystem repairs, which failed at some point but at least got the filesystem running as long as I did not touch the most corrupted locations, luckily it was RAID1 so most checksums had a correct value on another disk. Unfortunately the checksum tree had on two locations corruption on both copies. I had to open the raw disks with hex editor and change the offending byte to correct value, after which the filesystem has been running again smoothly for 5 years. And to find the location to modify on the disks I built a custom kernel that printed the expected value and absolute disk position when it detected the specific corruption. Plus had to ask a friend to double check my changes since I did not have any backups. reply matja 13 hours agorootparent> running again smoothly for 5 years So did you bite the bullet and get ECC, or are you just waiting for the next corruption caused by memory errors? :) reply londons_explore 19 hours agoparentprev> last week my btrfs filesystem got irrecoverably corrupted. This is 2 bugs really. 1, the file system got corrupted. 2, tooling didn't exist to automatically scan through the disk data structures and recover as much of your drive as possible from whatever fragments of metadata and data were left. For 2, it should happen by default. Most users don't want a 'disk is corrupt, refusing to mount' error. Most users want any errors to auto-correct if possible and get on with their day.

It can't be on the same filesystem it was created for or it negates the purpose of its creation. reply londons_explore 17 hours agorootparentIf I were designing it, the recovery process would: * scan through the whole disk and, for every sector, decide if it is \"definitely free space (part of the free space table, not referenced by any metadata)\", \"definitely metadata/file data\", \"unknown/unsure (ie. perhaps referenced by some dangling metadata/an old version of some tree nodes)\". * I would then make a new file containing a complete image of the whole filesystem pre-repair, but leaving out the 'definitely free space' parts. * such a file takes nearly zero space, considering btrfs's copy-on-write and sparse-file abilities. * I would then repair the filesystem to make everything consistent. The pre-repair file would still be available for any tooling wanting to see what the filesystem looked like before it was repaired. You could even loopmount it or try other repair options on it. * I would probably encourage distros to auto-delete this recovery file if disk space is low/after some time, since otherwise the recovery image will end up pinning user data to using up disk space for years and users will be unhappy.

As more people try it, it will hit more and more drives with buggy firmware and whatnot. reply viraptor 12 hours agorootparentThey're in a slightly different position though. Bcache itself has existed for many years and has been used in production. Bcachefs changes it quite a bit, but I wouldn't expect any basic issues we've seen elsewhere. reply bhaney 19 hours agoparentprevAs a heavy btrfs user, I do expect bcachefs to fully replace it eventually.

I remember when Btrfs was initially released (I was doing Solaris sysadmining, and it was billed as \"ZFS for Linux\"), and yet here we are all these years later and it still seems to be 'meh'. † E.g., RAID5+ that's less likely to eat data: * https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html#raid5... * https://bcachefs.org/ErasureCoding/ / https://github.com/koverstreet/bcachefs/issues/657 reply bhaney 19 hours agorootparentBy the time future-bcachefs has feature parity with present-btrfs, who knows what more will be in future-btrfs? For your specific example, bcachefs's erasure coding is very experimental and currently pretty much unusable, while btrfs is actively working towards fixing the raid56 write hole with the recent addition of the raid-stripe-tree. By the time bcachefs has a trustworthy parity profile, btrfs's may be just as good. reply throw0101d 18 hours agorootparent> For your specific example My specific example says that the bcachefs are \"actively working towards fixing the raid56 write hole\" as well—or rather, their way of doing things doesn't have one in the first place. reply bhaney 14 hours agorootparent> bcachefs are \"actively working towards fixing the raid56 write hole\" as well Yep, that's my point. Neither btrfs nor bcachefs have a write-hole-less parity raid profile implementation yet, and both are working towards one. We don't know if one will be finished and battle tested significantly before the other, or if one will prove to be more performant or reliable. Just have to wait and see. reply curt15 18 hours agorootparentprevBcachefs has not advertised erasure coding as production ready only to renege on that claim later. So nobody has been unwittingly burned yet. reply maxloh 19 hours agorootparentprevGPL only forbids ZFS to be distributed alongside Linux, it doesn't prevent users from installing it manually. (IANAL) reply vladvasiliu 18 hours agorootparentIn addition to what mustache_kimono said, there apparently seem to be issues with kernel functions moving / changing and breaking ZFS which then needs a while to catch up. For the latest reoccurrence of this, see https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/15931 for Linux 6.8 compatibility. There's also the fact that not everything is OOB compatible with ZFS. For example, newer versions of systemd have been able to use the TPM to unlock drives encrypted with LUKS. AFAIK it doesn't work with ZFS. I use ZFS on my daily driver Linux box and mostly love it, but as long as these things happen, I can see why people may want to try to find an in-kernel solution. I personally use Arch so expect for bleeding edge updates to not work perfectly right away. But I recall seeing folks complaining about issues on Fedora, too, which I expect to be a bit more conservative than Arch. reply didntcheck 18 hours agorootparentLUKS and the associated systemd hook shouldn't care about the filesystem, right? It's just block layer But presumably you meant native ZFS encryption, which unfortunately is considered to be somewhat experimental and neglected, as I understand. Which surprised me, since I thought data at rest encryption would be pretty important for an \"enterprise\" filesystem Still, apparently lots of people successfully run ZFS on LUKS. It does mean you don't get zero-trust zfs send backups, but apparently that's where a lot of the bugs have been anyway reply vladvasiliu 17 hours agorootparentYes, I was talking about ZFS native encryption. > But presumably you meant native ZFS encryption, which unfortunately is considered to be somewhat experimental and neglected, as I understand. Which surprised me, since I thought data at rest encryption would be pretty important for an \"enterprise\" filesystem. Yeah, I've happened about someone saying something similar, but I've never seen anything about that from \"official\" sources. Wouldn't mind a link or something if you have one on hand. But there is the fact that this encryption scheme seems limited when compared to LUKS: there's no support for multiple passphrases or using anything more convenient, like say, a U2F token. > Still, apparently lots of people successfully run ZFS on LUKS. It does mean you don't get zero-trust zfs send backups, but apparently that's where a lot of the bugs have been anyway I'd say I'm one of those people, never had any issue with this in ~ten years of use. And, indeed, the main reason for using this on my laptop is being able to send the snapshots around without having to deal with another tool for managing encryption. Also, on my servers on which I run RAIDZ, having to configure LUKS on top of each drive is a PITA. reply mustache_kimono 19 hours agorootparentprev> GPL only forbids ZFS to be distributed alongside Linux But does it even do that? You might be surprised when/if you read a little more widely. Position of OpenZFS project[0] is which I find persuasive (my emphasis added): In the case of the Linux Kernel, this prevents us from distributing OpenZFS as part of the Linux Kernel binary. *However, there is nothing in either license that prevents distributing it in the form of a binary module* or in the form of source code.

Might we agree then that the only thing that really matters is the law? And we should ignore other opinions coughlike from the FSF/the SFCcough which don't make reference to the law?

The so far theoretical claim of OpenZFS/Linux incompatibility is especially weak re: a binary kernel module. reply wtallis 16 hours agorootparentWhat matters in practice isn't the law, but how much trouble Oracle could cause should the lawnmower veer in that direction.

Veer in what direction? The current state of affairs re: Canonical and Oracle is a ZFS binary kernel module shipped with the Linux kernel. Canonical has literally done the thing that which you are speculating is impermissible. And, for 8 years, Oracle has done nothing. Oracle's attorneys have even publicly disagreed with the SFC that a ZFS binary kernel module violates the GPL or the CDDL.[0] Given this state of affairs, the level of legal certainty re: this question is far greater than the legal certainty we have re: pretty much any other open IP question in tech. What matters is practice, is that you stop your/the SFC's/the FSF's torrent of FUD. > Even a complete rewrite of ZFS would have some risk associated with it given Oracle's history. I'd ask \"How?\", but it'd be another torrent of \"What if...\"s. [0]: https://youtu.be/PFMPjt_RgXA?t=2260 reply wtallis 8 hours agorootparentI said that what matters is not the law, to which you responded by doubling down on your argument about what the law says, accused me of disagreeing with you on an issue I did not take a position on, and then went for the personal attacks. In case my lawnmower reference confused you enough that you were unable to make an appropriate response to the point I actually made, I'll try to state it a bit more clearly: It does not matter how confident you are that Oracle would eventually lose a lawsuit over using or distributing ZFS with the Linux kernel. If Oracle decides to attempt to exert control over ZFS and interfere with the use or distribution of ZFS with Linux, they have ample resources to make a lot of very expensive trouble for various users and organizations. Oracle's history—most importantly, their history vs Google re Java in Android—means it would not be much of a stretch for them to decide to start behaving like The SCO Group. I do not think this risk is large. But I do think it is a real risk that a cautious Linux distro can reasonably be worried about. If you truly believe that Oracle's lack of action thus far against ZFS on Linux and their public statements of their beliefs about the effects of the CDDL and GPL would prevent them from starting shit, then you are simply wrong about how our legal system works, and there are plenty of examples. The things you point to to bolster your arguments about what the law says are things that would make it hard for Oracle to win a lawsuit on its merits, but the eventual judgement is hardly the only thing that matters when assessing a legal risk—especially if your pockets are not as deep as Oracle's. reply mustache_kimono 5 hours agorootparent> I do not think this risk is large. But I do think it is a real risk that a cautious Linux distro can reasonably be worried about. The 2nd or 3rd most commercially important Linux distro has been using ZFS since 2016. > If you truly believe that Oracle's lack of action thus far against ZFS on Linux and their public statements of their beliefs about the effects of the CDDL and GPL would prevent them from starting shit I understand the argument \"Oracle might do something\", plus spooky magic fingers and creepy noises, all too well. Except it's not actually an argument. It might be best described as a boogeyman, sent to frighten little children into not running ZFS. My point was: I think it's time for you to get over sleeping with the light on. In 2000, we called this FUD when Microsoft did this. In 2024, we should know better, even when you're fronting for the FSF or the SFC. reply maxloh 19 hours agorootparentprevMaybe replace Oracle-owned code with a clean room implementation? reply arp242 19 hours agorootparentThey did that. It's called \"btrfs\". A stable clean-room ZFS with on-disk compatibility would be a huge task. How long did stable NTFS write capability take? And NTFS is a much simpler filesystem. It would also be a huge waste of time given that btrfs and bcachefs exist, and that ZFS is fine to use license-wise – it's just distribution that's a tad awkward (but not overly so). reply rascul 16 hours agorootparentInteresting to note here that btrfs came from Oracle. reply tadfisher 16 hours agorootparent\"Chris Mason is the founding developer of btrfs, which he began working on in 2007 while working at Oracle.

It's on v7 of posting to linux-block and will make snapshotting available for all block devices. reply apitman 11 hours agorootparentThis is the first I've heard of blksnap. Looks very interesting. There's not much documentation in the repo. Am I understanding correctly that if I were to build a custom WSL kernel with those patches, I would be able to do snapshotting in WSL today? Can you give or link to a brief description of how blksnap works? reply mappu 9 hours agorootparentYou could do block device snapshotting today if you build your block devices on top of LVM. You can also somewhat do it with fsfreeze and remounting your mount point on top of a dm-snapshot target. Blksnap is better because it does not require setup in advance like LVM, and it does not require interrupting any live users like fsfreeze. It \"should\" just work with the live block device within the WSL distro. LWN covered the v1 posting, which is a good start: https://lwn.net/Articles/914031/ This is all somewhat future-looking, and if you only want file-level snapshotting instead of block-level, it's probably easier to try and get btrfs/bcachefs/nilfs2 instead. My WSL2 on Windows 11 shows btrfs present inside /proc/filesystems. reply aseipp 14 hours agoparentprevHell, even just being able to use XFS would be an improvement, because ext4 has painful degradation scenarios when you hit cases like exhausting the inode count. (Somewhat related, but there has been a WIP 6.1 kernel for WSL2 \"in preview\" for a while now... I wonder why it hasn't become the default considering both it and 5.12 are LTS... For filesystems like btrfs I often want a newer kernel to pick up every bugfix.) reply chasil 15 hours agoparentprevCan this be used? I knew ReactOS would use it natively. https://github.com/maharmstone/btrfs reply apitman 11 hours agorootparentMaybe that could be adapted, but I don't think it would solve my problem currently. Basically I want to be able to do btrfs snapshots from within my WSL distros, so that I can run restic or similar on the snapshots. reply west0n 19 hours agoprevThe vast majority of databases currently recommend using XFS. reply londons_explore 19 hours agoparentAll modern databases do large block streaming appending writes, and small random reads, usually of just a handful of files. It ought to be easy to design a filesystem which can have pretty much zero overhead for those two operations. I'm kinda disappointed that every filesystem doesn't perform identically for the database workload. I totally understand that different file systems would do different tradeoffs affecting directory listing, tiny file creation/deletion, traversing deep directory trees, etc. But random reads of a huge file ought to perform near identically to the underlying storage medium. reply rubiquity 18 hours agorootparentWhat you’re describing is basically ext4. I do know there are some proprietary databases that use raw block devices. The downside being that you also need to make your own user space utilities for inspecting and managing it. reply west0n 19 hours agoparentprevI'm very curious if there are any databases running in production environments on Btrfs or ZFS. reply yjftsjthsd-h 19 hours agorootparentIt wasn't a company you've heard of, but I can absolutely tell you that there are:) We really benefited from compressing our postgres databases; not only did it save space, but in some cases it actually improved throughput because data could be read and uncompressed faster than the disks were physically capable of. Edit: Also there was a time when it was normal for databases to be running on Solaris, in which case ZFS is expected; my recollection is that Sun even marketed how great of a combination that was. reply dfox 16 hours agorootparentSun marketed the combination of PostgreSQL and ZFS quite heavily. But IIRC most of the success stories they presented involved what was decidedly non-OLTP read heavy workload with somewhat ridiculously large databases. One of the case studies even involved using PostgreSQL on ZFS as an archival layer for Oracle, with the observation that what is a large Oracle database is medium-sized one for PostgreSQL (and probably even more so if it is read mostly and on ZFS). Sunhad some recommendations for tuning PostgreSQL performance on ZFS, but the recommendations seemed weird or even wrong for OLTP on top of CoW filesystem (I assume that these recommendations were meant for the above mentioned DWH/archival scenarios). reply eru 19 hours agorootparentprevInteresting. The compression options that postgres offers itself were not enough? reply yjftsjthsd-h 18 hours agorootparentIt went the other way; we were using ZFS to protect against data errors, then found that it did compression as well. But looking now, the only native postgres options I see are TOAST, which seems to only work for certain data types in the database, and WAL compression (that's only existed since pg 15), so unless I've missed something I would tend to say yes it's far superior to the native options. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentI mostly only looked into the options offered by MariaDB a while ago, and they seemed quite neat. I had just assumed that postgres was at least on par. Thanks for reporting! reply riku_iki 13 hours agorootparentprevpostgres allows to compress only large text and blob column values. reply chasil 14 hours agorootparentprevOnly 12 pages.

When I wanted to reinstall I naively thought I could format the root super volume and keep /home subvolume -- but this was impossible: I had to format /home as well according to the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed installer. Major problem for me. I now have separate root (btrfs) and home (ext4) partitions. reply stryan 16 hours agoparentYou can do it but it's not a very happy path. Easiest way is probably to map the old home subvolume into a different path and either re-label the subvolumes once you're installed or just copy everything over. Separate BTRFS root and ext4 home partitions is either the default filesystem layout now if you're not doing FDE or the second recommended one. reply streb-lo 18 hours agoprevAs someone who uses a rolling release, I use btrfs because I don't want to deal with keeping ZFS up to date. It's been really good for me. And btrbk is the best backup solution I've had on Linux, btrfs send/receive is a lot faster than rsync even when sending non-incremental snapshots. reply kccqzy 16 hours agoparentSame here: I use a rolling release and btrfs. Personally I really enjoy btrfs's snapshot feature. Most of the time when I need backups it's not because of a hardware failure but because of a fat finger mistake where I rm'ed a file I need. Periodic snapshots completely solved that problem for me. (Of course, backing up to another disk is absolutely still needed, but you probably need it less than you think.) reply matja 13 hours agoparentprev> I don't want to deal with keeping ZFS up to date That's what DKMS is for, which most distros use for ZFS.

On a rolling distro this is a pretty common breakage AFAIK. It's not the end of the world, but it is annoying. reply yjftsjthsd-h 13 hours agoparentprevDepends on the rolling release; some distros specifically provide a kernel package that is still rolling, but is also always the latest version compatible with ZFS. reply TZubiri 18 hours agoprev [–] reminder that btrfs stands for butter filesystem and not better filesystem reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

So yeah, it might be annnoying buit in the long term it won't matter much anymore (same as the company) reply catwell 11 minutes agoparentTalking about bait and switch for Redis makes no sense. Redis is a 15 years old project started in 2009 by Salvatore 'Antirez' Sanfilippo. He worked on his startup, then at VMWare, them at Pivotal, and only joined Redis Labs (created in 2011) in 2015. In 2018 Redis Labs changed the license of their modules and Antirez published http://antirez.com/news/120 In 2020 he quit. Anyway I agree with the conclusion: Redis will be forked, the fork will win and Redis Labs will become irrelevant. reply jeffparsons 5 minutes agoparentprevAre you talking about the developers who willingly contributed code under the BSD licence? The same BSD licence that says that it's completely fine for the company to do this? It's such a strange pattern that plays out again and again: developers insist that a permissive license is the way to go, until somebody (or company) they don't like exercises their rights. Usually what said developers actually wanted was the GPL, because they realise in retrospect that they didn't want the company to be allowed to do this. But they didn't like it because it restricts recipients rights. So they want people to have those rights as long as they never actually exercise them? It's all very confusing. I say this having contributed to and released my own projects under both permissive and copyleft licenses — based on what I'm actually willing for people to be able to do with the code. reply Alifatisk 36 minutes agoparentprevI don’t think this is about bait-and-switch, I believe (like some other comments mentioned) they want a bigger part of the pie.

When individual developers contribute back, they weren't doing it to enable AWS to freeload. AWS of course is the single biggest reason why projects are flocking to more restrictive licenses. The right thing to do for AWS would have been to respect the work of the original authors (/company) and throw their weight behind an offering supported by the original developers. Instead, AWS builds a competing product when they see an OSS product succeeding. Third party vendors stand no chance after that due to the tighter integration and marketing muscle. Not to mention, Amazon and AWS give so little back to Open Source despite being a big (the biggest?) beneficiary. Google, Microsoft and even Oracle do more for Open Source than Amazon. reply elric 35 minutes agoparentSome time ago I tried to argue for a FOSS license that would disallow code from being used by AI. I got a lot of negative feedback saying that this wouldn't be FOSS because it imposes restrictions etc. The same is true for the SSPL.

Many people have yet to learn about dozens of obscure databases (that have been in development for years) simply because AWS or other big cloud providers have not pushed them. Also, many projects receive a lot of contributions (bug reports, PRs, patches) due to liberal licenses increasing their use and popularity.

As far as I can see, this license means that Redis the company gets some exclusivity on who can run a hosted version of their product, and everybody else gets it for gratis, with source we can change libre. reply vineyardmike 1 hour agoparentIt’s not “open source” now. Your view on its impact is orthogonal to this reality. People’s view on this reality is orthogonal to its impact Personally, I’ve grown tired of this debate. Redis is clearly commercial software. None of my “freedoms” rely on redis, the way they might on more core or primitive softwares like Linux, Bash, or a browser. The real (but non-exclusive) value of the invention lies in commercial applications. I’ll bring out my “it’s not OSS” pitchfork when VI or eMacs changes their licenses. I care deeply about open source software, but not all source code matters. Contributing is a thankless task that benefits people’s profit driven interests. It’s understandable that contributors would like to try for some of that profit, and this doesn’t seem to be too aggressive either. Yea, the relationship changed, because they were “giving it away” prior. But so what, life is full of changes. There is only a handful of organizations this will impact and they’re all rich corporations that don’t need my pity. The project is mature, so most remaining work is likely feature adds required by mega-scale and niche commercial uses cases, that’s just not work people usually do for fun. Pardon my aggression - it’s rhetorical- but redis doesn’t need to exist in this world. It certainly doesn’t need anyone’s emotions. reply bawolff 47 minutes agorootparent> There is only a handful of organizations this will impact and they’re all rich corporations that don’t need my pity. The project is mature, so most remaining work is likely feature adds required by mega-scale and niche commercial uses cases, that’s just not work people usually do for fun. There is still a long tail on this. For example, wikipedia offers a cloud like platform thar people who contribute to wikipedia can sign up for free to, get some web space where they can make small unofficial tools, provided that the tool is somehow related to wikipedia. This includes redis hosting among other things (https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Toolforge/Redis_for... ). The license change would probably effect that use case ( the RSAL would prohibit that. The situation with the SSPL is less clear (IANAL)) reply stavros 59 minutes agorootparentprevWell, if you've grown tired of this debate, maybe I shouldn't reply, but maybe someone else wants to have it: Sure, it's not OSI-OSS, but what does that mean for the world, in practical terms? OSI-defined OSS means \"comes with no restrictions, except maybe redistribution\", whereas this license adds another restriction (you can't run the software as a service without offering the source, as I understand it). How does this restriction affect us? It surely can't be that OSS as defined by the OSI is the only good thing, and anything else is horrible, it has to be a continuum. Why is this license so bad, when it only affects AWS? How are my liberties being restricted? It doesn't really answer anything to say \"it's not open source\", because that just implies that we already agree on why that's bad. reply inejge 6 minutes agorootparentSure, it's not OSI-OSS, but what does that mean for the world, in practical terms? One practical consequence: Linux distributions will drop the new Redis, and ship its OSS fork or an alternative protocol-compatible cache. Or perhaps continue with the pre-license-change version for a while, which is a kind of fork. What was the relatively simple \"apt install redis\" will now be \"apt install freeredis\" or \"apt install awesome-cache\" or \"apt install redis73\". So you will have churn. I don't have an idea how many installations are via the official docker image; they won't change, but even there now you have a legal risk, however tiny: will Redis Inc. come after us for our usage? Legal departments are allergic to risk: witness their aversion to GPL variants, especially GPLv3 and AGPL. So perhaps there will be pressure to avoid Redis, again causing churn. reply vineyardmike 19 minutes agorootparentprevWell I always welcome a healthy discussion so feel free to answer. I’ve really just grown tired of seeing outrage that software which was previously “OS as defined by the famous organizations” changes to protect their commercial interests. Like you said, there’s a continuum, and I really don’t think that “you can’t sell this as a service” is a huge restriction on freedom. Especially when I can still use the software (even commercially) if I host it myself. Many of these services (Redis, Elastic Search, Mongo, etc) wouldn’t really exist without commercial use cases, and I really care more about protecting individuals freedoms and the use case of a human using a machine in their own hands for their own use. The extent of my interest in OSS being good/bad (if you can make that claim at all) is in the impact to individuals at home. Also, the server side license just feels like the modern viral license we should have. GPL ensures all code running together is forced open, and AGPL ensures clients are open, and this ensures that the server is open. Seems good to me the same way GPL or AGPL are good. I view it like government regulation. Bureaucracy is waste and I’m all for enriching society and creating new jobs and products with better commerce… but environmental protections and safety protections help society. If your business can’t exist without endangering someone, I won’t miss it. If your business exists solely to resell free software (explicitly designed for commercial use) that someone else made, and they don’t want to give it to you for free anymore, I won’t care it if you need to change up your business. reply zokier 27 minutes agorootparentprevThere is larger community impact of not being FOSS. Most immediate, distros will not package it anymore. Overall you will not be able to include Redis in FOSS projects in the same way anymore. In longer term this means that Redis will not enjoy similar integration with other projects; FOSS projects tend to prefer using/depending/integrating other FOSS projects, so Redis becoming non-FOSS means that it loses that preferred status. And so on. reply jeltz 27 minutes agorootparentprevThat Redis cannot be included in many Linux distributions anymore. Is that enough of a practical impact? reply bawolff 1 hour agoparentprevIts no longer open source, if being open source isn't one of your requirements then it probably doesn't directly effect you. It might indirectly effect you as some free labour from the open source community might dry up. E.g. your linux distro might no longer package it and you might have to rely on packages maintained by redis which might not be as well integrated into your distro (although lots of users probably don't care about that) reply ForHackernews 1 hour agorootparent\"open source\" has always been a marketing term. It doesn't mean anything because it's never meant anything. The GNU people fought the good fight on free/libre software, but they lost because companies are greedy and devs are lazy at their day jobs. reply bawolff 1 hour agorootparentThe people who coined the term (OSI) gave a definition when they coined the term.

Pretty much every company I've worked at has wanted legal signoff for use of any open source project. Granted, compliance with that directive was often spotty. But some did have a tool to scan our repositories for dependencies, and flag things that had licenses not on an approved list (which, no, was not the entirety of OSI-approved licenses). reply sakjur 46 minutes agoparentprevIt opens you up to a larger litigation surface. Previously, you didn’t risk having to explain to a court that you’re really not offering Redis as a service even though your service is using Redis. Copyleft licenses are limited to the software itself, but SSPL expands this to ”including, without limitation, management software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software”. If there’s even the tiniest risk of having to comply with that, I’d stay clear of anything SSPL licensed. reply stavros 44 minutes agorootparentThat makes sense, thank you. reply supz_k 37 minutes agoprevSlightly off-topic: Until last week, we used Redis for Laravel queues and cache in our blogging platform. We decided to get rid of Redis and use the database. The reason was that we are planning to allow self-hosting of our software so removing a dependency is a huge win to reduce complexity (didn't know about the license change then). There are a lot of arguments against using a relational DB for queues, but from our testing, it just worked! So, we just went with it in production. Surprisingly, there are no noticeable performance issues so far. We initially used Redis because, well, Laravel recommends it.

The follow-up question would be what allows them to still use the old contributions together with the new proprietary ones and the answer is: the permissive license of the old contributions. If the old contributors have not wanted that, they should not have contributed to a project under a permissive license. reply kelnos 15 minutes agorootparentTo be clear (for the GP and others): the consequence of the parent's second paragraph is that if the old license were something like the GPL, this wouldn't be allowed, unless all copyright holders consented to the change. (The GPL specifically does not allow \"adding restrictions\", which the new licenses do.) But since the old license is BSD/MIT (I think?), it's fine.

I wonder if that is basically an integration of Redis Cluster into AWS. reply ZiiS 1 hour agorootparenthttps://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/ reply Gasp0de 1 hour agorootparentprevYes it is, as well as ElastiCache reply CrLf 42 minutes agoprevIt's about time we stopped calling projects that require copyright assignments \"open-source\", because they aren't. Regardless of license. reply kelnos 14 minutes agoparentAll GNU projects require assigning copyright to the FSF[0]. It feels a little absurd to call a GNU project \"not open source\". But I would certainly trust the FSF not to change licensing terms (aside from moving to newer versions of the GPL/LGPL) to something unsavory, while the same can't be said of any old random project out there. I think that trust (or lack thereof) is the real issue. Ultimately, though, it's better to just not have to trust; I don't sign over my copyright to projects either, unless it's part of a job and the stuff that I write would otherwise be owned by my employer anyway.

Or Eclipse? Or CNCF? reply jeltz 2 minutes agorootparentYup! I might make an exception at some point but so far I haven't. I believe that all contributors should be equals and not some have more rights than others. Also I need to research and trust the entity which I sign the CLA with. reply SuperSandro2000 10 minutes agoprevCapitalism does capitalism things... reply mort96 2 hours agoprevAlternative title: Redis is no longer open source but rather source available. reply nailer 1 hour agoparentNot sure why this is downvoted, it’s accurate. reply efilife 1 hour agoparentprevAren't those two interchangeable? reply speedgoose 1 hour agorootparentNo really. Many proprietary software are source available but far from being open source. Even Microsoft Windows is source available if you are an important customer: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sharedsource/default.aspx A bit more public and open to anyone is Unreal Engine's source code: https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/... reply nicce 1 hour agorootparentThat Windows page seems to be from 2015. Wonder if that still applies. reply my123 31 minutes agorootparentYes, it does still apply reply gcau 41 minutes agorootparentprevTo a lot of people (if not the majority outside hacker-news), yes. reply cthalupa 30 minutes agorootparentprevNope. This is tied to the whole \"Free as in speech, not beer\" thing. Open Source has core definitions around the freedoms (the \"speech\") allowed to people when making use of that source code. Source available makes the source code available for free (the \"beer\") along with certain specific freedoms, but not all of the freedoms that would be required to be Open Source. Whether or not you think those missing freedoms are important is a matter of personal opinion, I suppose. I think they are, which is why I try to avoid source available software if there is a reasonable open source alternative. reply kelnos 8 minutes agorootparentSource available need not be free as in beer, though. A company can charge for it, and of course restrict distribution. reply bawolff 1 hour agorootparentprevNo reply darby_eight 1 hour agorootparentprevThey are. The change is that the source is no longer (as?) free. reply externedguy 5 minutes agoprevPerfect, yet another reason to use BEAM languages reply lionkor 2 hours agoprevWill have to find an alternative that can work with sentry to eat 150 GB of RAM for no reason /s reply figmert 1 hour agoparentI don't know which part of your comment you're saying sarcastically, but I presume you're referencing the fact that Redis uses up a lot of memory. This is because Redis is a caching database, and pulls the data into memory for it to be faster. This is by design. reply cthalupa 24 minutes agorootparentI believe the sarcasm is around Sentry and implying that it's redis usage is poorly optimized. I'm not familiar with Sentry, but it looks like the self hosted version makes use of redis as part of it's underlying stack. reply the_mitsuhiko 1 hour agoparentprevI recognize our (Sentry’s) over-use of redis. Also doesn’t make us particularly happy. Can’t promise that this will get significantly better but the desire is there at the very least. reply Comma2976 28 minutes agoparentprevJust run a few instances of any JVM application reply stees 57 minutes agoparentprevKeyDB? :) reply wg0 1 hour agoprev [–] Another wonderful piece of open source software swallowed by corporate warlords. Now expecting an OpenRedis fork soon from AWS? reply mirekrusin 1 hour agoparent [–] It's the other way around. Mega corps are cut off from leeching on open work. It's the only sustainable way to have business model around open work. With pure open source licensing you have asymmetry - where a) you guys implement it b) we sell it, thanks - problem. You cannot run sustainable business around it. As far as I understand it they want to preserve \"open sourceness\" for self hosted projects - ie. if you run redis in your docker/vm/k8s, you're fine. But if mega corp clouds are offering managed service, they need to give back a cut from premium they're charging end users. reply ncruces 11 minutes agorootparentBut now you're open to [Redis] taking you to court saying that your service that uses [Redis] is too similar to “just [Redis]” for you to offer it to anyone else. Field of use restrictions are a terrible idea, and totally incompatible with “open sourceness”. reply Abroszka 53 minutes agorootparentprev> As far as I understand it they want to preserve \"open sourceness\" for self hosted projects - ie. if you run redis in your docker/vm/k8s, you're fine.

I like it and I think this is how open source should work to thrive. reply cthalupa 16 minutes agorootparentThe world would be a very different place if, say, the people that wrote apache httpd felt this way. I don't know what it would look like, so I won't weigh in on whether or not it would be a good or a bad thing. But it would assuredly be different. reply bogantech 19 minutes agorootparentprevNevertheless the leeches will start a big PR campaign about how the creators are evil for wanting a piece of the pie just like they did for Terraform reply jeltz 6 minutes agorootparentRedis is also on the the leeches in this case. They have a 500 people company which plans to profit off of hosting Redis and wants to have a competitive advantage by being the only ones who do not have to open source their modifications. reply wg0 31 minutes agorootparentprev [–] by corporate warlords I mean - the ones leeching off the open source work. :) reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
