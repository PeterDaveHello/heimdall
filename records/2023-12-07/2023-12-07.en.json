I wonder if EU citizens feel well-served by e.g. the pop-up banners that afflict the global web as a result of their regulations[1]. Do they feel like the benefits they get are worth it? What would it take for that calculus to change?1 - Yes, some say that technically these are not required. But even official organs of the EU such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;europa.eu continue to use such banners. reply IanCal 0 minutes agorootparent> This is such an understated point. I wonder if EU citizens feel well-served by e.g. the pop-up banners that afflict the global web as a result of their regulations[1]. Do they feel like the benefits they get are worth it? What would it take for that calculus to change?Absolutely. It goes far beyond cookie management, it&#x27;s a fundamental thing about what you&#x27;re allowed to do with my data without my consent.You know you can block them right? Ublock origin has \"annoyances\" in the lists, just tick that. makeitdouble 4 hours agorootparentprevAs a former EU citizen, yes it was great. Most of the dirty tricks pulled when you register or buy something online were off by default, and even if I somewhat got ropped in some stinky mailing list a litteral single click would get me out of it. Even killing your account could be done in one legally binding email. No 50 pages \"do you really want to quit ?\" and no \"Do you not not not not not refuse to to not let us delete your account ?\" last question.Now I&#x27;m feeling how bad it is on the other side of the fence, and the funny thing is people don&#x27;t seem to give a shit because they never experienced decent regulation and being fucked by brands is just the way of life. reply drakonka 2 minutes agorootparentprevAs an EU citizen, yes I feel well-served. Having been burned by companies refusing to delete my personal information before when trying to close accounts, I appreciate having some regulations and basic rights in this respect. I also feel safer shopping online and not getting \"stalked\" by personalized ads everywhere is nice.It was a bit of a pain to manually reject all the _purposefully_ annoying cookie consent banners that companies started pulling, but now there&#x27;s plugins for that, which reject everything for me by default. reply sensanaty 5 minutes agorootparentprev> I wonder if EU citizens feel well-served...Yes, because I can tell them to fuck off from harvesting all my data and have an easy, legally enforceable way to tell them to delete whatever data they&#x27;ve harvested off me. I&#x27;ve reported a few websites that have done shady shit with the cookie banners and even saw them get some fines, so I&#x27;m perfectly happy that companies can&#x27;t hoover up any and all data about me that they want to feed the pockets of some rich assholes an ocean over.If a company can&#x27;t exist without massive privacy violations and personal data exfiltration then they deserve to die. reply t_mann 4 hours agorootparentprevI think that having the right to ask companies to tell you what personal data they&#x27;re storing on you and asking them to delete it is well worth the minor annoyance of dealing with cookie banners, which are largely the result of the industry trying to discredit that regulation, btw (until they became something that can be de facto considered part of the law through adopted practice).As regards the lesser availability of American tech, I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s much more limited in China, which coincidentally happens to have the most notable domestic AI industry outside of the US. It&#x27;s something that economists can be reluctant to admit, but for which there&#x27;s solid evidence by now afaik, that at least temporary import barriers, if done right, can be a boost to industrial development. The thing that is weird about the EU regulation is that they&#x27;re putting the same shackles on their domestic tech industry, which is dwarfed by the giant US incumbents who have more resources to invest in compliance than startups (apart from the bits that apparently only target said encumbants that some posters have mentioned here, which I don&#x27;t know anything about). reply runako 4 hours agorootparentTo your first point: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38553315Again, folks say the cookie banners are not required, but even the EU web managers are unable to build a site without them. So maybe they are \"practically\" required for all sites?> they&#x27;re putting the exact same shackles on their domestic tech industryThe Digital Markets Act is an attempt to fix this by targeting the American tech companies specifically, without explicitly naming them in the law. I would venture that the DMA is why Gemini isn&#x27;t available in the EU right now, like it is in the rest of the world where US companies are allowed to do commerce. reply djvdq 41 minutes agorootparent> targeting the American tech companies specifically, without explicitly naming them in the lawNo, it&#x27;s targeting all big tech companies, not only American.You can stop this pathetic lament that the evil EU is attacking innocent American corporations. It&#x27;s typical american ignorance. reply t_mann 2 hours agorootparentprevOn the second point, you were replying while I was updating my comment, sorry about that. I know it&#x27;s a controversial opinion, but from the perspective of the EU, I think having regulation that effectively only targets US Tech makes sense for the reasons mentioned above. It may not exactly be &#x27;fair game&#x27;, but to anyone who thinks the US isn&#x27;t doing the exact same thing, I&#x27;m sure Airbus executives for one would have some enlightening stories.On the first point, I think user rights trump developer convenience, so I stand by what I said. reply runako 2 hours agorootparent> having regulation that effectively only targets US Tech makes senseI agree, this may be good for Europe in the long term. However, one would expect to see the protectionist measures coupled with similar measures intended to generate competitive native alternatives. Limiting the expansion of Boeing is great, as long as you have Airbus. Without Airbus, you&#x27;re starting to make some real compromises.> to anyone who thinks the US isn&#x27;t doing the exact same thingUS is currently playing both sides of this in the chip space in an attempt to wrestle some of the power back from China. Unlike the DMA, the US effort is putting a lot of money on the line to help build local alternatives.IIRC Cliqz was an EU-financed search engine project that looked like it was going to be a contender, but I think Covid killed it. Projects like that could be the way. reply t_mann 2 hours agorootparentYeah, while I think some of the tech-related EU regulations like GDPR are a net benefit, the idea that you could become a leader in AI through regulation seems ludicrous to me.In all fairness, there are some genuine European players in the AI space (eg Mistral), and they also produced one of the early global hits (StableDiffusion, which was largely developed in Munich afaik). But if you look at the overall footprint in AI (research output at top conferences, patents (which are basically impossible to get for anything software-related in the EU),...), Europe seems at risk of hopelessly falling behind. And in the face of that, it&#x27;s concerning that policy makers&#x27; chief concern seems to be further curtailing it. reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentprevGithub doesn&#x27;t have a cookie banner. reply fauigerzigerk 2 hours agorootparentprev>Again, folks say the cookie banners are not required, but even the EU web managers are unable to build a site without them.They have a pretty interesting explanation of each cookie they use:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;european-union.europa.eu&#x2F;cookies_enWhat I never quite understand is the analytics issue. We had server logs for analytics long before everyone started using cookies for that.In my opinion the cookie part of GDPR is clearly bad regulation. It requires cookie banners for some things that are not privacy issues. And at the same time it doesn&#x27;t institute a sensible consent mechanism that doesn&#x27;t in practice amount to constant harassment. reply runako 2 hours agorootparent> We had server logs for analytics long before everyone started using cookies for that.IIRC a server log that retains IP addresses is covered under GDPR and may itself require disclosure via e.g. a popup. (IP addresses are part of the protected class of personal data.)More to the point, server logs != modern Web analytics. Modern Web analytics require someone to ingest lots of data and run an app to allow users to analyze that data. Common practice outside of sensitive industries like healthcare and finance means offloading all of that ingestion&#x2F;storage&#x2F;management&#x2F;analytics to a third party, hence 3P cookies. reply fauigerzigerk 2 hours agorootparent>IIRC a server log that retains IP addresses is covered under GDPR and may itself require disclosure via e.g. a popup. (IP addresses are part of the protected class of personal data.)It is covered under GDPR but I think the general consensus is that server logs containing IP addresses do not require consent. You just need a legal basis for collecting the data and this has to be spelled out in the privacy policy.>More to the point, server logs != modern Web analytics. Being \"modern\" is not a sufficient explanation for why it is necessary. Using third party services does not generally require consent either. reply openplatypus 2 hours agorootparent> It is covered under GDPR but I think the general consensus is that server logs containing IP addresses do not require consent.It depends on the legal basis. If you store these IPs to render service or combat fraud, you might get away from explicit consent. However, if you use and store these IP addresses for analytics, then it is a very different conversation.GDPR is not just about what and how you collect and use data. reply fauigerzigerk 1 hour agorootparent>It depends on the legal basis.Indeed it does. So it will come down to the specific purpose of any analytics.Consent is only one of six different legal bases that can justify processing personal data.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legislation.gov.uk&#x2F;eur&#x2F;2016&#x2F;679&#x2F;article&#x2F;6 replysilversmith 3 hours agorootparentprevEU citizen - I love it. Couple clicks to tell a website not to profile me is nothing. You already are rejecting mailing lists and offers everywhere, what&#x27;s one more thing.I don&#x27;t get spam mailing lists or robocalls. I can safely sign up to services knowing I will be able to unsubscribe easily.

I politely smile and nod. reply Notatheist 42 minutes agorootparent>I don&#x27;t get spam mailing lists or robocallsNot strictly true. I get robocalls and WhatsApp spam messages from country code +1 all the time. reply bayindirh 2 hours agorootparentprevBeing able to tell a webpage that they can&#x27;t share my data to their 780 data partners in a legally binding way with a click is priceless. reply jug 24 minutes agorootparentprevI think the cookie banners didn&#x27;t work as intended and they&#x27;re a good example of the lack of insight in the web and how web designers tick by people writing the laws. Other than those though, I like most of the regulations including Digital Markets Act that is (probably) behind this delay. They give us much better control over where and how our data is handled, give us leverage to have corporations delete said data. Microsoft even built a better version of Windows 11 for us* (but only for us) and that was awesome to watch happen. The difference will probably be even greater in Windows 12. Without the EU, very little of this would have happened and that&#x27;s simply too much power to corporations.Yes, \"you chose to use them so you decided to follow their terms of use and privacy clauses\" but key here is how you&#x27;re more and more often required to use certain services online or you&#x27;re put at significant disadvantages ranging from keeping in touch with your family or friends to being disadvantaged in the job market.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.windows.com&#x2F;windows-insider&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;16&#x2F;preview... reply andrewmutz 4 hours agorootparentprevThe banners drive me absolutely crazy. And I don&#x27;t care if the authors of the law never intended the banners, policy is judged on is consequences (not it&#x27;s intent).Is it possible for the law to be amended so that non-EU citizens can use a browser flag that just says \"I&#x27;m fine withe the cookies\"? That way Europeans can enjoy all the cookie consent clicking and the rest of us can go back to how the web was before? reply berkes 1 hour agorootparentWe had (have?) that flag in browsers.But once too many people switched it in the &#x27;do not track&#x27; mode, the industry decided to simply ignore it.You cannot get a more clear sign that government pressure and laws are needed, than that. reply bayindirh 1 hour agorootparentI think there&#x27;s a recent ruling states that web pages can&#x27;t ignore the Do Not Track flag sent by the browser, and another one is coming for cookie preferences, too. reply fauigerzigerk 1 hour agorootparentprevThe law might get fixed eventually, but I fear we will never go back to how the web was before because flooding people&#x27;s screens with popups has become the norm everywhere and among all types of organisations with very few exceptions. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentprevYes, I feel well served and we should regulate even more.And even though I tend to complain about UNIX like OSes, maybe they are the key to free Europe from US corporations operating systems, like a few other countries are already doing as well.We should stick to international regulated programing languages and OSes, that free us from dependencies on export technology regulations. reply roboben 4 hours agorootparentprevSimple solution: Do not use cookies which are not strictly necessary and you don’t need a banner. reply runako 4 hours agorootparentI was going to write something tongue in cheek but instead I will simply say that your \"simple solution\" automatically opts you out of a lot of tooling that site operators have grown to find indispensable over the last couple of decades. Compliance with the EU regulations such that you can legally operate a website without a cookie banner establishes a fairly retrograde set of bounds on how you operate your site.Which is their prerogative[1]. I&#x27;m just pointing out that the people who run the EU&#x27;s official websites aren&#x27;t able to operate inside those bounds, so it&#x27;s fair to say those bounds are not commercially reasonable in general for functional sites. QED the banners are de facto required.1 - The extensive reach of the law is breathtaking. The EU claims jurisdiction over any web property, based anywhere in the world, that might be seen by an EU national. reply archerx 3 hours agorootparentWhat tooling? There are no tools that I need to implement on my sites that requires third party cookies. Maybe I just respect my audience and not try to spy every last detail about them? reply runako 3 hours agorootparentReally not trying to make a value judgement here. Just observing that many Web professionals do find value in tools that use third-party cookies, and such value is not always about spying or selling data.For example, the European Parliament website uses third-party cookies for analytics and for Web streaming. Yes, they can run the whole stack themselves. It is also a) more work and b) not how most of the industry works.The European Parliament with the resources of the EU, finds it expeditious to use 3P cookies and just display a cookie banner. How reasonable is it to expect sites with fewer resources to do similar interesting things on the Web without also falling afoul of the EU law? reply posterboy 47 minutes agorootparentprev> it&#x27;s fair to say those bounds are not commercially reasonable in general for functional sites. QED the banners are de facto required.For all I care your site isn&#x27;t required to be commercially viable. If you aren&#x27;t able to convince the customer and instead opt for so-called cooky-terror banners as a dark pattern with the primary goal of de-sensitive-izing users, you don&#x27;t deserve my cooky. Opt-in means legislation has passed this view into law, with the quirk that the dark-pattern is fully expected because the industry needs a sort of legitimization for the use of private data. Small companies usually suffer under compliance, no doubt.Besides, what has this to do with AI prompts? No doubt they want to analyse every single interaction as a sort of supervised training for free. This does not rely on third party cookies, but it might benefit from making identifications which somebody could argue are not essential to the service as advertised.Is that the kind of tooling that site operators have grown to find indispensable over the last couple of decades, that you mention? reply IanCal 1 hour agorootparentprev> 1 - The extensive reach of the law is breathtaking.Not really, it&#x27;s about the rights of people represented by the EU. reply gmerc 2 hours agorootparentprevThe EU is preventing a wholesale sellout of the continent. It’s great. reply MyFirstSass 21 minutes agorootparentprevAs a EU citizen; The intentions are good, some of GDPR is great, and some of the huge fines have been welcome in a world where corporations usually always gets tiny fines.That said, as with most heavy bureaucracies there&#x27;s just not enough internal organisational tech education so lobbying and misunderstandings end up diluting the process.Example is the cookie banners leading people away from smaller competitors strengthening monopolies, and teaching people to click at 100 banners a day because no one has time to read so much.Another is GDPR which is great but a huge hassle for smaller orgs and companies.Everything always ends up a win for the largest players, while the smaller ones struggle to maintain legality.That has been my experience with a few GDPR processes. reply Joeri 3 hours agorootparentprevI challenge you to point out the specific paragraphs of GDPR you object to as somehow unreasonable or targeting american tech companies.The cookie banners are a bad outcome for sure, but GDPR does not mandate them. They are an indirect result of the bureaucracy installed by GDPR which does not incentivize user-friendly design of privacy-aware features. I don’t want GDPR rolled back, even as a software developer, because I think it creates the kind of protections everyone in the world should have. But I would like a rule clarification on how to build compliant websites without cookie banners, so I blame the administration (the EU commission) but not the legislation.The digital markets act similarly is the kind of regulation we need everywhere. It’s only hostile to online businesses because other places don’t have those kind of guard rails on the abusive behavior of big tech.Now, as far as the EU AI act. I think that in its original intent when it was specifically targeting things like public face recognition by governments it was a very good idea, but it has been hijacked and in its current form it would be very harmful if passed. I don’t think it particularly targets american tech companies, because the biggest victims would be EU AI startups like Mistral. reply mahkeiro 3 hours agorootparentExactly, and this law is used everyday against European companies that tries to grab too much data. The US is the epitome of the surveillance society on par with China (look at how Apple wad sending push notification, or how phone companies just share your location data with the world). Here in Europe we fight by making sure that the data cannot be collected in the first place. reply IanCal 1 hour agorootparentprev> The cookie banners are a bad outcome for sure, but GDPR does not mandate themNot only that but the terrible banners you get are very often not compliant with GDPR. reply runako 3 hours agorootparentprev> specific paragraphs of GDPRGDPR doesn&#x27;t target American tech companies, that&#x27;s the DMA. Essentially, the framing is there are companies that are \"gatekeepers\" and then everyone else. The criteria for gatekeepers are theoretically objective, but they were written with a specific set of companies in mind. As a consequence, the designated companies except TikTok just so happen to be based in the US. Further, the rules were written such that EU firms like Spotify are not eligible.Also, Vodafone somehow is not considered a gatekeeper in any relevant digital market.Anyway, no judgement. We are in a time of rising protectionism. This may be good for Europe. But the DMA clearly targeted a set of West Coast US companies and it&#x27;s doing what it was intended to do.I do wish they would modify GDPR to only apply to people e.g. physically in Europe or similar. It really does make the Web worse for billions of people who are not EU nationals and derive absolutely no benefits from the banners.While they&#x27;re regulating browsers and plugs, could they make browser makers ship EU versions of their browsers that show the popups, while the rest of us save tons of clicks? EU nationals could install EU versions of their favorite browsers and the rest of us would just use the stock versions. reply davedx 1 hour agorootparentIsn&#x27;t it mostly about companies with platforms or app stores? Vodafone isn&#x27;t a gatekeeper because it doesn&#x27;t have its own app store. reply sussmannbaka 1 hour agorootparentprevThe banners (in their annoying form) are illegal under gdpr and sites are pivoting away. The DNT header will replace it, as it entirely suffices to signal my opting out: I tell the site owner in a machine readable form that I don’t wish to be tracked. There was no legal basis for this to mean anything before. It feels pretty good to not be sold out by my government to the highest bidding tech company and if the price I’m paying is having no access to wildly overhyped AI toys, I’ll manage. reply IanCal 1 hour agorootparent> The banners (in their annoying form) are illegal under gdpr and sites are pivoting awayThis needs to be more widely known.Also, because they need active consent - any cookie banner blocking extension (weird to see so few people talk about this when it&#x27;s seen as obvious we need ad blockers) means no consent and is perfectly fine under GDPR. You&#x27;re not required to signal \"no\". reply Roark66 3 hours agorootparentprevAs an EU citizen I hate it (cookie popups). I think the stupid regulation achieved nothing and essentially \"broke the Internet\" by normalising popups that obscure content while anyone that tracks can do so using alternatives.Sadly the EU is being led by a clique of unelected beaurocrats (commisars - like in the USSR) and the most democratic of institutions - the EU parliament as well as national parliaments have very little influence on what is being proposed and bulldozed in. For example, let&#x27;s say in a given country literaly everyone is opposed to ACTA and the country has the balls to veto it (despite the beaurocrat&#x27;s usual tricks of rolling in together things everyone wants and needs with absolute crap like ACTA). The same idea is brought back again 2 years later (ACTA v2). It is vetoed again, it is brought back again 2 years later and this time bypasses the veto by being \"voluntary\". \"Countries that don&#x27;t want it don&#x27;t need to implement\" - great on paper. Until you realise most people in the EU oppose it, including in the countries that implement it and by the fact of implementing it in the majority they make it a de-facto standard which increases the cost of doing business affected in the countries that now have differing regulations.Same thing is being done with the \"EU constitution\". No one, other than it&#x27;s rulers, wants the EU to be a country. The idea got shot down immediately in a popular vote. So they are essentially implementing it anyway bit by bit by stretching the law and outright breaking it (especially against countries that vote in parties that are not in the EPP club).I&#x27;m a big fan of the idea of EU as it was before the treaty of Nice. It was a group of countries with similar values creating an open market and agreeing to make decisions affecting it together. Sadly the institutions that were created to oversee that structure have the priorities of their own (increasing their own power) and using both the method mentioned above and simply doing things \"extra legally\" (as lawyers say) they do whatever they want and if the extremely corrupt \"court\" tied to them decides it&#x27;s OK there is no way to question it. These bastards say they are \"strenghtening the EU\". They are destroying it.

Even if GPT-4V were aligning a pretrained image model and pretrained language model with a projection layer like PaLM-E&#x2F;LLaVA&#x2F;MiniGPT-4 (unconfirmed speculation, but likely), it&#x27;s not as if they are not &#x27;natively&#x27; training the composite system of projection-aligned models.There is nothing in any of Google&#x27;s claims that preclude the architecture being the same kind of composite system. Maybe with some additional blending in of multimodal training earlier in the process than has been published so far. And perhaps also unlike GPT-4V, they might have aligned a pretrained audio model to eliminate the need for a separate speech recognition layer and possibly solving for multi-speaker recognition by voice characteristics, but they didn&#x27;t even demo that... Even this would not be groundbreaking though. ImageBind from Meta demonstrated the capacity align an audio model with an LLM in the same way images models have been aligned with LLMs. I would perhaps even argue that Google skipping the natural language intermediate step between LLM output and image generation is actually in support of the position that they may be using projection layers to create interfaces between these modalities. However, this direct image generation projection example was also a capability published by Meta with ImageBind.What seems more likely, and not entirely unimpressive, is that they refined those existing techniques for building composite multimodal systems and created something that they plan to launch soon. However, they still have crucially not actually launched it here. Which puts them in a similar position to when GPT-4 was first announced with vision capabilities, but then did not offer them as a service for quite an extended time. Google has yet to ship it, and as a result fails to back up any of their interesting claims with evidence.Most of Google&#x27;s demos here are possible with a clever interface layer to GPT-4V + Whisper today. And while the demos &#x27;feel&#x27; more natural, there is no claim being made that they are real-time demos, so we don&#x27;t know how much practical improvement in the interface and user experience would actually be possible in their product when compared to what is possible with clever combinations of GPT-4V + Whisper today. reply andai 4 hours agorootparentprevIf what they&#x27;re competing with is other unreleased products, then they&#x27;ll have to compete with OpenAI&#x27;s thing that made all its researchers crap their pants. reply mnky9800n 2 hours agorootparentprevWhat makes it native? reply teleforce 6 minutes agorootparentGood question.Perhaps for audio and video is by directly integrating the spoken sound (audio mode -> LLM) rather than translating the sound to text and feeding the text to LLM (audio mode -> text mode -> LLM).But to be honest I&#x27;m guessing here perhaps LLM experts (or LLM itself since they claimed comparable capability of human experts) can verify if this is truly what they meant by native multi-modal LLM. reply TaylorAlexander 11 hours agorootparentprevI’m impressed that it’s multimodal and includes audio. GPT-4V doesn’t include audio afaik.Also I guess I don’t see it as critical that it’s a big leap. It’s more like “That’s a nice model you came up with, you must have worked real hard on it.

ChatGPT has already replaced Google for me and I wonder if Google starts to feel the pressure. reply alberth 15 hours agorootparent> \"ChatGPT has already replaced Google for me\"Would you mind elaborating more on this.Like how are you \"searching\" with ChatGPT? reply c-hendricks 15 hours agorootparentSome of my searches aren&#x27;t really searches, they&#x27;re questions which Google has the information to be able to sum it up. A few weeks ago I was trying to remember the name of a site that put up two movie posters and you pick which one you liked more.Googled \"What was the website that showed two movie posters and you picked the one you liked more?\" and I got links to reddit, lots to letterboxd, some quora, and a lot more, all irrelevant to my question.Asked ChatGPT that same question verbatim and> The website you&#x27;re referring to is probably \"Flickchart.\" It&#x27;s a platform where users can compare and rank movies by choosing which one they like more between two movie posters or movie titles. Please note that my knowledge is up to date as of January 2022, and the availability and popularity of such websites may change over time.Another time I was looking for the release dates of 8 and 16-bit consoles. With Google I had to search for each console individually, sometimes offered a card with the release date, sometimes didn&#x27;t and I&#x27;d have to go do more digging.So I asked ChatGPT and got a nice formatted list with dates reply gurchik 13 hours agorootparentVery similar to your second example, I&#x27;ve been using ChatGPT to calculate the total calories in a recipe. Before, I would consult a database like the USDA food database for nutrition info and do measurement conversion manually. I&#x27;ve tried asking ChatGPT for the same recipe and the total amount was within 1% of what I calculated. It runs into a couple snags I&#x27;ve noticed though.First, it always gives a calorie count for cooked meat, but it should assume the meat is uncooked since I said it was for a recipe.Second, it seems to struggle with the concept of uncooked rice. If you ask it to work with 1 \"rice cooker cup\" of rice, it refuses because that isn&#x27;t a standard measurement. If you swap in the converted standard measurement (3&#x2F;4 cup), it still is way off. It told me 3&#x2F;4 cup uncooked rice is about 150 calories when cooked. That&#x27;s a third of what the USDA database gives. When you point out that 3&#x2F;4 cup uncooked rice is a large serving after being cooked, it changes its answer to 375 calories, still about half of what the USDA database gives. But this is fine for me because rice is not typically part of my recipes since it doesn&#x27;t usually require special preparation.Overall it reduces a 10 minute task to 10 seconds, but you need to know enough about the ingredients to spot obvious problems in its result. In my case I could see the calories given for meat was way too high, and way too low for rice. It gave a better answer after telling it to fix the former and ignore the latter.I tried a second recipe and the total it gave was 2% under my calculation, but I did not see any obvious error in its result so I could not correct it further.It is unfortunate that you kind of have to trust the numbers are correct, but this is no different than the nutrition details on sites like MyFitnessPal which are often wrong when you closely examine it. reply sebastiennight 9 hours agorootparentWait. 150 is one third of the USDA answer, and 375 is half of the USDA answer? What is the USDA answer?This equation is beyond my paygrade!Edit: I asked our GPT3.5 bot to solve this, and it hallucinated \"pulling up the USDA database\" ; complete with a \"(a few moments later...)\" message before giving me 160 calories as the USDA answer.I asked the same bot (identical prompts) with GPT-4-Turbo enabled and it went through \"step by step\" to say the correct answer is 461 calories because 1&#x2F;3 cup uncooked is 1 cup cooked, so 1 rice cooker cup (160g) = 3&#x2F;4 cup uncooked, so 2.25 cooked * 205 = 461 cal.Is that the right answer? If so, 375 seems far from \"half\" reply gurchik 6 hours agorootparentThe database gives 716 calories for 1 cup uncooked rice. So, 537 calories for 3&#x2F;4 cup. It was a mistake to say 375 was half of 537, my intention was to point out that it&#x27;s not close.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fdc.nal.usda.gov&#x2F;fdc-app.html#&#x2F;food-details&#x2F;168881&#x2F;n...I don&#x27;t have access to GPT-4 but your results are interesting. I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s trying to approximate the yield of the uncooked rice after cooking before giving a calorie estimate. From my testing it doesn&#x27;t do this for other ingredients like raw chicken.It seems to be more accurate when giving calorie estimates for a list of ingredients instead of a single ingredient. For example, in a recipe that includes \"boneless skinless chicken thighs (1 lb, raw)\" ChatGPT gives \"about 880 calories\" as the answer. But in a new prompt if you ask it only about the chicken and nothing else, it gives \"between 1100 and 1300 calories.\" The USDA database shows 144 calories per 100 grams, so 653 calories per pound. The first answer by ChatGPT is much more accurate.I have no idea why this is the case, and I bet this would be easy for a researcher to demonstrate if true. Alas, I don&#x27;t have API access. reply londons_explore 2 hours agorootparentprevYou should probably consider most calorie calculations to be +-50% anyway due to huge differences between human digestion and the way calories are estimated in a lab. reply behnamoh 8 hours agorootparentprevThese (I call them) \"reverse-dictionary\" searches are absolutely amazing on ChatGPT! I&#x27;ve asked it several times things like \"what&#x27;s the word you use to describe a situation that&#x27;sbut slightly ?\" and ChatGPT consistently \"gets\" what I&#x27;m looking for. What a time to be alive. reply thefourthchime 5 hours agorootparentI did this the other day. For some reason, I was trying to think of a word for nationalism a-holes and it was something like Django, and I thought, is it Jengoism, but that didn&#x27;t sound right...So I asked ChatGPT: \"There’s a word that sounds kinda like Django but it’s like jingoistic\"Turns out I was right, it&#x27;s \"jingoistic\", but then I could go on and ask:\"Give me the definition of the word, then.\"\"The term \"jingoistic\" refers to a form of extreme and aggressive patriotism, often characterized by a belligerent foreign policy. It denotes a belief in the superiority and righteousness of one&#x27;s own country, sometimes leading to the denigration of other nations and the advocacy of aggressive political and military actions.\"\"Where does the word come from?\"\"The origin of the word \"jingoistic\" traces back to a popular British song from the 1870s. The song, with the refrain \"We don&#x27;t want to fight, but by Jingo if we do, We&#x27;ve got the ships, we&#x27;ve got the men, and got the money too,\" was sung during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878). It expressed support for the British government&#x27;s aggressive stance towards Russia.The phrase \"by Jingo\" in the song is believed to be a minced oath, a euphemistic expression used to avoid swearing. \"Jingo\" here stands in for a stronger word, likely a reference to God. Over time, the term \"jingoism\" evolved to describe an aggressive, belligerent form of patriotism and foreign policy, and \"jingoistic\" is the adjective form used to describe someone who exhibits this attitude.\"Fascinating! For anyone who is interested in learning, there hasn&#x27;t been a tool like ChatGPT since the internet itself! reply kolinko 54 minutes agorootparentImportant note here - ask for the definition in a separate thread, otherwise if it hallucinated the word it will still keep hallucinating the definition. reply jeremiahbuckley 7 hours agorootparentprevGreat idea.Me: “staircase wit” is a very charming phrase.

Now what?If they address the competition then they have to undo that optimisation and cut into their own profits.My guess is they won&#x27;t settle for merely extortionate profits, they won&#x27;t address the competition fully and so people will flip to using LLM-first search.I&#x27;m hoping that in a year or so we&#x27;re asking why Google went from being the top search on Bing to being only one of many - principally LLM-based - tools people are using for getting answers (most of what &#x27;search&#x27; represents now).

Then if you want to verify a particular tidbit you can go to Google. reply melagonster 5 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft Bing have same mistake, if I used your browser for chat, why you force me search first:( reply LeonardoTolstoy 15 hours agorootparentprevThe first is maybe a good example of where an LLM integrated search engine makes sense. Because \"compare two movies\" has flickchart as the third option for me. But it is nowhere to be seen for \"compare two movie posters\" which is how I read your search originally (and indeed flickchart is about ranking movies not the posters themselves ... Obviously).Anyways an LLM clearly teased that out whereas if you misremember or misread something a straight search is going to be bad.Most of my searches are the opposite. I was to know about an obscure movie from the 80s with a toy helicopter. Google very neatly suggests Defense Play (correct) but most LLMs I&#x27;ve tried end up just suggesting very popular films with a helicopter and it ends up being quite difficult to get it to give me information about obscure stuff. Also with that same search the LLM suggests a bunch of incorrect films since (and I figured this out later) it turns out that it was all sourced from a single forum thread from the 90s where a bunch of the posts suggested movies that don&#x27;t have toy helicopters in them. Go figure. reply SomewhatLikely 11 hours agorootparentThanks, this gave some good insight to GPT4.

People have described these types of outputs as the text equivalent of a highly compressed JPEG, which seems to fit well with what&#x27;s going on here. It gets some of the top level elements right and kind of remembers there&#x27;s some kind of vehicle that&#x27;s important but it has forgotten all the details, even the date the movie was released. But unlike a human who might indicate their fuzziness (was it a helicopter or a submarine?), GPT4 gladly pretends like it knows what it&#x27;s talking about. I think it&#x27;s likely a solvable problem, the model probably has the information to know when it&#x27;s confident and when it&#x27;s in a fuzzy JPEG region but the current alignment isn&#x27;t doing a great job of surfacing that. reply c-hendricks 15 hours agorootparentprev\"compare two movies\" on Google doesn&#x27;t even have flickchart for me, and rewording my question to not involve posters also doesn&#x27;t have flickchart in the results.So, get as pedantic as you&#x27;d like, but Google really dropped the ball.

It worked first try, I could inspect the code it generated and saw it looked correct, it was within my original estimate. Took less than one minute.I had a question about adding new RAM to my computer, about what things I should take into account since the original brand no longer makes paired dimms that match my current spec. It gave me a big bullet list of all of the things I should compare between my current ram, my current motherboard and any new ram I would choose to buy to ensure compatibility.Both of these are things I might have gone to Google (or even reddit) for previously but I believed I could get faster answers from ChatGPT. I was right in both cases. I didn&#x27;t have to construct a complicated query, I didn&#x27;t have to filter SEO spam.

It certainly fails or hallucinates and I always feel I have to double check it, However, it just feels more reliable as a first stop compared to Siri or Wolfram.I don&#x27;t want to have to think \"is this a query Siri can handle?\" or \"will Wolfram Alpha manage to work for this query?\" - I just want to get a pretty good answer quickly with no hassle. reply nomel 13 hours agorootparentprevWhich ChatGPT can utilize with the plugin!

I literally started writing a response to you saying \"it doesn&#x27;t seem to count only weekdays\" but in order not to be wrong on the Internet I went back and checked and buried in the interface is a link \"Count only workdays\".So, my answer to why: It was actually faster and easier using ChatGPT to get it to write Python than it would have been for me to use Google to find the site and then to use the site.

But as for now the online service is far from smooth (intermittent), not as fast and seamless as Google search.Granted I use ChatGPT-4 with subscription but if later the online RAG browsing feature is opened for free to the public I can see more people abandoning Google for casual searching (i.e most of the Internet users). They keyword here is &#x27;casual&#x27; and what LLM provided us is the intuitive nature of searching using it even with miss spellings or missing words.I think Google is realizing this and before this exodus really happened it needs to do something otherwise the adage of \"nothing last forever\" will come true sooner or later for Google. The main thing for Google now is how to monetize this technology assuming that they have similar product because all this while they are struggling with Deepmind to generate income and, voila ChatGPT just shows them how to do it.

One of the plugins is Internet access via Bing. It automatically chooses which plugins to call upon based on the context it infers from your question - you don&#x27;t have to select anything.Here&#x27;s an example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;be3821e7-1403-44fb-b833-1c73f3...It correctly finds a texture atlas example by discovering it nested inside of Bevy&#x27;s github.Note that it didn&#x27;t summarize when I didn&#x27;t say to conditionally consider summarizing. I consider this poor behavior, but I&#x27;m confident it would elaborate if I followed up. The initial seed prompt by OpenAI encourages concise answers (likely as cost saving measure but also for brevity)I realize this is just a glorified \"I&#x27;m Feeling Lucky\" search, but I find it to be a much better UX, so I default to it over Googling. It&#x27;s nice to be able to seamlessly transition from \"search\" to \"brainstorm&#x2F;discuss\" without losing context. reply vy007vikas 15 hours agorootparentI searched for \"github bevy rust texture atlas code\" and the first link is what ChatGPT provided as well.

If the thoughts in my head go from, \"Can I see an example of this?\" to \"Okay can I give you some of my code and have you refactor it using this example?\" to \"now I want to actually edit the texture atlas\" I don&#x27;t have to switch programs or exert effort.It&#x27;s really convenient.For a less contrived, more impressive example (multi-modality is insane!), see these: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;iy6FkBOThe above example shows me uploading 16 sprite tiles to GPT. The files were labeled 0-15 on my system. I uploaded them in two parts because there is a 10 file upload limit. I wanted to create a sprite sheet from these sprite tiles and didn&#x27;t want to open an editor. So, I had it do it. After it worked, I realized I needed the three sprite sheets in varying colors (dirt, sand, and food) so I had it find&#x2F;replace the dirt color with sand&#x2F;food color. It then gave me download links to all three and all three were good results and saved me time.(and yes, I know I don&#x27;t have to compliment it.

Just formulate your search query as a question and type it into ChatGPT; it&#x27;s not much more complicated than that. Looking over my ChatGPT history over the last week or two, I&#x27;ve asked it for stuff like what I should eat if I have certain fitness goals, how to improve meals, how to work out more effectively, lots of coding-related questions, which types of heating for a house are most cost-efficient, etc. For almost all those questions (minus the coding ones) I know Google will return blogspam, so I didn&#x27;t even bother. reply nomel 12 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;ve asked it for stuff like what I should eat if I have certain fitness goals, how to improve meals, how to work out more effectivelyThe sad reality is that typing this into google would have given you AI generated content, anyways. Might as well use the best model for it. reply joshstrange 11 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s replaced search for me (Kagi in my case) but for anything where I&#x27;m looking for an answer with a bit of background ChatGPT takes the cake. It completely removes the need for me to click through to multiple websites and sum it up myself manually.In the same way google&#x2F;search made it possible to answer a question in real-time in a group of friends, ChatGPT does that but better in most cases. Yes, you have to deal with hallucinations and while they happen less often they do happen but you have to deal with crap in web searches as well.Search is a super-power (most people suck at searching) and being able to grab information via ChatGPT feels very similar. reply 93po 7 hours agorootparentprevI ask quick coding questions exclusively to chatgpt. it&#x27;s extremely direct and quick compared to stackoverflow (or god forbid any other website with 3 pages of someone&#x27;s life story first) and if i paste in the segment of code im working on it&#x27;ll even show me with my own code. reply hot_gril 7 hours agorootparentSame, also Google is now ranking tons of spammy SEO&#x27;d coding sites above useful ones like StackExchange. I could restrict to StackOverflow, but maybe the answer is on dba.stackexchange or something instead, plus it&#x27;s annoying. reply MattRix 15 hours agorootparentprevI’m not OP but I do much fewer Google searches now as well.Prior to ChatGPT, the majority of my Google searches ended up on either Wikipedia (for direct information), Reddit (for opinions&#x2F;advice), or StackOverflow (for programming questions).Now all those use cases can be done by ChatGPT, and it’s faster, especially because it requires less skimming to find useful data. reply j_bum 15 hours agorootparentprevIn addition to the other response, you can ask ChatGPT to search for you (via Bing) and provide a cited answer, or you can ask it to curate a set of results that might match your search query.Here’s a humorous example from a recent GPT-mediated search: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;ec874cd5-7314-4abc-b169-607601... reply spaceman_2020 14 hours agorootparentprev1. Most coding and documentation questions now go straight to GPT-42. Most quick general purpose questions like \"What is 4-month sleep regression in babies?\" go to GPT-3.53. If I want to deep dive on a topic, I find myself either using one of the custom GPTs (Grimoire is great for coding), or increasingly, talking to it via voice chat. It&#x27;s particularly great if I&#x27;m walking around the house doing chores and want to learn something I would otherwise turn to Wikipedia for (say, the successors to Genghis Khan and the various Khanates). reply jmknoll 13 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s particularly great if I&#x27;m walking around the house doing chores and want to learn something I would otherwise turn to Wikipedia for (say, the successors to Genghis Khan and the various Khanates).This sounds like a great use case. What is your setup for this? Do you have ChatGPT connected to a smart speaker? reply spaceman_2020 13 hours agorootparentNo, I just use my airpods and the iPhone app. I use the voice chat and ask questions, then follow up questions.Like I was reading a book about Genghis Khan the other day, which got me into Wikipediaing all his sons and grandsons. While doing chores, I asked chatGPT \"tell me about Genghis Khan&#x27;s sons\", and then follow up questions like \"what was the name of the khanate or empire Ogedai founded?\"It&#x27;s an absolutely fantastic tool for diving into a new topic. reply p_j_w 11 hours agorootparent>While doing chores, I asked chatGPT \"tell me about Genghis Khan&#x27;s sons\", and then follow up questions like \"what was the name of the khanate or empire Ogedai founded?\"You actually trusted the information it gave you? reply kolinko 38 minutes agorootparentWith time you learn where it’s trustworthy and where you need to check for bullshit. reply spaceman_2020 3 hours agorootparentprevIf I trust Wikipedia for this info, then I have no reason to distrust it.And I’m asking about Ogedai Khan and the Ilkhanate, not my child’s health. It’s okay if I learn something wrong :D reply m_fayer 12 hours agorootparentprevI think the Star Trek computer has actually been achieved now. And Google didn&#x27;t get there first. reply esafak 3 hours agorootparentprevSimple: you don&#x27;t (have to) because searching was a means to an end. And now that end is served through a different product; a conversational agent. reply chatmasta 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve had dozens of moments over the past few months where I got frustrated at the lack of answers from a Google search, remembered ChatGPT, pasted the exact same query into its chatbox, and got an immediate answer (which was also way clearer than any answer from Google, or any blogspam site Google could have sent me to). reply mike00632 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve had the same experience. Now ChatGPT is my go-to.I often paste error messages with context into the chat and ask what&#x27;s wrong. reply vnchr 15 hours agorootparentprevSearching is frequently a means to the end of answering some question. I find myself more often asking the question directly with both Google and chat, GPT. ChatGPT comes to mind sooner for a question that requires two or more searches. reply thefourthchime 5 hours agorootparentprevI just did this responding to another comment. My late night &#x2F; slightly drunk brain wanted to know:\"What is that annoying thing where I have to click on on all the websites. Because of cookies and Europe\"Google: Links to things full of SEO and ads and maybe answer the question eventually.ChatGPT: The \"annoying accept\" button you often have to click on websites, particularly in Europe, is related to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas.Websites are required to get your consent before they can store or retrieve any information on your device, such as cookies. Cookies are small data files used to remember your preferences, login information, and browsing history. The GDPR mandates that websites must inform users about the cookies they use and obtain their consent before placing these cookies on their devices.This is why you see those cookie consent notices – websites are legally obligated to ask for your permission to use cookies, and you must actively agree to it, usually by clicking an \"Accept\" button. This process aims to protect your privacy and give you more control over your personal data online. reply crote 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the wrong answer, though.Websites are required to get your consent before they can track you. Storing cookies or other information is totally fine if it is purely functional, for example a login session or dark mode preference. Similarly, tracking without consent is also forbidden if they do so without using tracking cookies. reply saagarjha 4 hours agorootparentprevUsing cookies for any of these purposes does not require a banner, though. reply acchow 13 hours agorootparentprevChatGPT does Bing searches automatically then consumes the results for you. reply ZoomerCretin 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m surprised no one has mentioned Perplexity yet. It uses ChatGPT and a public web searching API to provide answers. For cases where you absolutely do not want hallucinations, but you also want information that requires a search and reading a few web pages, it is far superior to a Google search alone. reply pbronez 10 hours agorootparentprevI use Kagi’s AI stuff for search all the time. Just type in a question and add !fast… it’ll search the web, write a response based on what it finds, and gives you the links. It’s not perfect, but it’s at least as good as Bing with much less annoying UX. reply corethree 12 hours agorootparentprevA lot of people on HN were very dismissive of chatGPT. I think you missed the boat. It&#x27;s way beyond a stochastic parrot right now.Whatever you call it, this thing is the closest to a human that a machine has ever been. Talking to chatGPT is quite close to talking to a human being that has the knowledge of all of google inside his brain.If you&#x27;re a developer and you&#x27;re not paying for chatGPT or copilot you are literally operating at a disadvantage. Not a joke. reply tavavex 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not OP, but I still feel kind of confused by people saying that ChatGPT is a 100% equivalent replacement for search engines. I&#x27;m not saying that LLMs aren&#x27;t extremely impressive in their current stage, but that the use cases for the two are different, at least for me. In my mind, LLMs seem to be more useful for open-ended questions, problem solving, and formulating questions that wouldn&#x27;t be suited for a search engines. But when I use Google, I&#x27;m usually not looking for answers, but specific places on the internet. If I need to find an email of a professor at my university, or a Github page for a project, or the official website of some software I need - I don&#x27;t see why I&#x27;d need to replace Google with an LLM for it. reply mewpmewp2 10 hours agorootparentNot 100% equivalent, but I definitely use more of ChatGPT than Google to solve any of my problems nowadays. reply corethree 6 hours agorootparentprevTrue but their use cases do intersect quite a bit. This is also ignoring the fact that chatgpt4 will actually use bing to search for things when it feels the need to do so. It will literally tell you when it does this. The LLM is no longer generating just text it is taking action well outside the boundaries of text generation. reply m_fayer 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah I was one of those. Now that the power it brings has dawned on me I&#x27;m trying to integrate it everywhere I can with a \"where was this thing for half my life\" feeling. I truly think it&#x27;s a bigger revelation than Google was when it first appeared.There&#x27;s definitely something disquieting behind the elation. reply corethree 11 hours agorootparentOf course.First of all this technology is on track not to just assist you better, but to replace you.Second it&#x27;s not huma",

    "originBody": "AI Introducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model Dec 06, 2023 min read Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link Making AI more helpful for everyone Sundar Pichai CEO of Google and Alphabet Demis Hassabis CEO and Co-Founder, Google DeepMind Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Mail Copy link In this story In this story Note from Sundar Introducing Gemini State-of-the-art performance Next-generation capabilities Scalable and efficient Responsibility and safety Availability A note from Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai: Every technology shift is an opportunity to advance scientific discovery, accelerate human progress, and improve lives. I believe the transition we are seeing right now with AI will be the most profound in our lifetimes, far bigger than the shift to mobile or to the web before it. AI has the potential to create opportunities — from the everyday to the extraordinary — for people everywhere. It will bring new waves of innovation and economic progress and drive knowledge, learning, creativity and productivity on a scale we haven’t seen before. That’s what excites me: the chance to make AI helpful for everyone, everywhere in the world. Nearly eight years into our journey as an AI-first company, the pace of progress is only accelerating: Millions of people are now using generative AI across our products to do things they couldn’t even a year ago, from finding answers to more complex questions to using new tools to collaborate and create. At the same time, developers are using our models and infrastructure to build new generative AI applications, and startups and enterprises around the world are growing with our AI tools. This is incredible momentum, and yet, we’re only beginning to scratch the surface of what’s possible. We’re approaching this work boldly and responsibly. That means being ambitious in our research and pursuing the capabilities that will bring enormous benefits to people and society, while building in safeguards and working collaboratively with governments and experts to address risks as AI becomes more capable. And we continue to invest in the very best tools, foundation models and infrastructure and bring them to our products and to others, guided by our AI Principles. Now, we’re taking the next step on our journey with Gemini, our most capable and general model yet, with state-of-the-art performance across many leading benchmarks. Our first version, Gemini 1.0, is optimized for different sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. These are the first models of the Gemini era and the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind earlier this year. This new era of models represents one of the biggest science and engineering efforts we’ve undertaken as a company. I’m genuinely excited for what’s ahead, and for the opportunities Gemini will unlock for people everywhere. – Sundar Introducing Gemini By Demis Hassabis, CEO and Co-Founder of Google DeepMind, on behalf of the Gemini team AI has been the focus of my life's work, as for many of my research colleagues. Ever since programming AI for computer games as a teenager, and throughout my years as a neuroscience researcher trying to understand the workings of the brain, I’ve always believed that if we could build smarter machines, we could harness them to benefit humanity in incredible ways. This promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we’ve wanted to build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive — an expert helper or assistant. Today, we’re a step closer to this vision as we introduce Gemini, the most capable and general model we’ve ever built. Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of information including text, code, audio, image and video. 10:25 Introducing Gemini: our largest and most capable AI model Gemini is also our most flexible model yet — able to efficiently run on everything from data centers to mobile devices. Its state-of-the-art capabilities will significantly enhance the way developers and enterprise customers build and scale with AI. We’ve optimized Gemini 1.0, our first version, for three different sizes: Gemini Ultra — our largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks. Gemini Pro — our best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks. Gemini Nano — our most efficient model for on-device tasks. State-of-the-art performance We've been rigorously testing our Gemini models and evaluating their performance on a wide variety of tasks. From natural image, audio and video understanding to mathematical reasoning, Gemini Ultra’s performance exceeds current state-of-the-art results on 30 of the 32 widely-used academic benchmarks used in large language model (LLM) research and development. With a score of 90.0%, Gemini Ultra is the first model to outperform human experts on MMLU (massive multitask language understanding), which uses a combination of 57 subjects such as math, physics, history, law, medicine and ethics for testing both world knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Our new benchmark approach to MMLU enables Gemini to use its reasoning capabilities to think more carefully before answering difficult questions, leading to significant improvements over just using its first impression. Gemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks including text and coding. Gemini Ultra also achieves a state-of-the-art score of 59.4% on the new MMMU benchmark, which consists of multimodal tasks spanning different domains requiring deliberate reasoning. With the image benchmarks we tested, Gemini Ultra outperformed previous state-of-the-art models, without assistance from object character recognition (OCR) systems that extract text from images for further processing. These benchmarks highlight Gemini’s native multimodality and indicate early signs of Gemini's more complex reasoning abilities. See more details in our Gemini technical report. Gemini surpasses state-of-the-art performance on a range of multimodal benchmarks. Next-generation capabilities Until now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models involved training separate components for different modalities and then stitching them together to roughly mimic some of this functionality. These models can sometimes be good at performing certain tasks, like describing images, but struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning. We designed Gemini to be natively multimodal, pre-trained from the start on different modalities. Then we fine-tuned it with additional multimodal data to further refine its effectiveness. This helps Gemini seamlessly understand and reason about all kinds of inputs from the ground up, far better than existing multimodal models — and its capabilities are state of the art in nearly every domain. Learn more about Gemini’s capabilities and see how it works. Sophisticated reasoning Gemini 1.0’s sophisticated multimodal reasoning capabilities can help make sense of complex written and visual information. This makes it uniquely skilled at uncovering knowledge that can be difficult to discern amid vast amounts of data. Its remarkable ability to extract insights from hundreds of thousands of documents through reading, filtering and understanding information will help deliver new breakthroughs at digital speeds in many fields from science to finance. 10:25 Gemini unlocks new scientific insights Understanding text, images, audio and more Gemini 1.0 was trained to recognize and understand text, images, audio and more at the same time, so it better understands nuanced information and can answer questions relating to complicated topics. This makes it especially good at explaining reasoning in complex subjects like math and physics. 10:25 Gemini explains reasoning in math and physics Advanced coding Our first version of Gemini can understand, explain and generate high-quality code in the world’s most popular programming languages, like Python, Java, C++, and Go. Its ability to work across languages and reason about complex information makes it one of the leading foundation models for coding in the world. Gemini Ultra excels in several coding benchmarks, including HumanEval, an important industry-standard for evaluating performance on coding tasks, and Natural2Code, our internal held-out dataset, which uses author-generated sources instead of web-based information. Gemini can also be used as the engine for more advanced coding systems. Two years ago we presented AlphaCode, the first AI code generation system to reach a competitive level of performance in programming competitions. Using a specialized version of Gemini, we created a more advanced code generation system, AlphaCode 2, which excels at solving competitive programming problems that go beyond coding to involve complex math and theoretical computer science. 10:25 Gemini excels at coding and competitive programming When evaluated on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, AlphaCode 2 shows massive improvements, solving nearly twice as many problems, and we estimate that it performs better than 85% of competition participants — up from nearly 50% for AlphaCode. When programmers collaborate with AlphaCode 2 by defining certain properties for the code samples to follow, it performs even better. We’re excited for programmers to increasingly use highly capable AI models as collaborative tools that can help them reason about the problems, propose code designs and assist with implementation — so they can release apps and design better services, faster. See more details in our AlphaCode 2 technical report. More reliable, scalable and efficient We trained Gemini 1.0 at scale on our AI-optimized infrastructure using Google’s in-house designed Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) v4 and v5e. And we designed it to be our most reliable and scalable model to train, and our most efficient to serve. On TPUs, Gemini runs significantly faster than earlier, smaller and less-capable models. These custom-designed AI accelerators have been at the heart of Google's AI-powered products that serve billions of users like Search, YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play and Android. They’ve also enabled companies around the world to train large-scale AI models cost-efficiently. Today, we’re announcing the most powerful, efficient and scalable TPU system to date, Cloud TPU v5p, designed for training cutting-edge AI models. This next generation TPU will accelerate Gemini’s development and help developers and enterprise customers train large-scale generative AI models faster, allowing new products and capabilities to reach customers sooner. A row of Cloud TPU v5p AI accelerator supercomputers in a Google data center. Built with responsibility and safety at the core At Google, we’re committed to advancing bold and responsible AI in everything we do. Building upon Google’s AI Principles and the robust safety policies across our products, we’re adding new protections to account for Gemini’s multimodal capabilities. At each stage of development, we’re considering potential risks and working to test and mitigate them. Gemini has the most comprehensive safety evaluations of any Google AI model to date, including for bias and toxicity. We’ve conducted novel research into potential risk areas like cyber-offense, persuasion and autonomy, and have applied Google Research’s best-in-class adversarial testing techniques to help identify critical safety issues in advance of Gemini’s deployment. To identify blindspots in our internal evaluation approach, we’re working with a diverse group of external experts and partners to stress-test our models across a range of issues. To diagnose content safety issues during Gemini’s training phases and ensure its output follows our policies, we’re using benchmarks such as Real Toxicity Prompts, a set of 100,000 prompts with varying degrees of toxicity pulled from the web, developed by experts at the Allen Institute for AI. Further details on this work are coming soon. To limit harm, we built dedicated safety classifiers to identify, label and sort out content involving violence or negative stereotypes, for example. Combined with robust filters, this layered approach is designed to make Gemini safer and more inclusive for everyone. Additionally, we’re continuing to address known challenges for models such as factuality, grounding, attribution and corroboration. Responsibility and safety will always be central to the development and deployment of our models. This is a long-term commitment that requires building collaboratively, so we’re partnering with the industry and broader ecosystem on defining best practices and setting safety and security benchmarks through organizations like MLCommons, the Frontier Model Forum and its AI Safety Fund, and our Secure AI Framework (SAIF), which was designed to help mitigate security risks specific to AI systems across the public and private sectors. We’ll continue partnering with researchers, governments and civil society groups around the world as we develop Gemini. Making Gemini available to the world Gemini 1.0 is now rolling out across a range of products and platforms: Gemini Pro in Google products We’re bringing Gemini to billions of people through Google products. Starting today, Bard will use a fine-tuned version of Gemini Pro for more advanced reasoning, planning, understanding and more. This is the biggest upgrade to Bard since it launched. It will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories, and we plan to expand to different modalities and support new languages and locations in the near future. We’re also bringing Gemini to Pixel. Pixel 8 Pro is the first smartphone engineered to run Gemini Nano, which is powering new features like Summarize in the Recorder app and rolling out in Smart Reply in Gboard, starting with WhatsApp — with more messaging apps coming next year. In the coming months, Gemini will be available in more of our products and services like Search, Ads, Chrome and Duet AI. We’re already starting to experiment with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience (SGE) faster for users, with a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S., alongside improvements in quality. Building with Gemini Starting on December 13, developers and enterprise customers can access Gemini Pro via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI. Google AI Studio is a free, web-based developer tool to prototype and launch apps quickly with an API key. When it's time for a fully-managed AI platform, Vertex AI allows customization of Gemini with full data control and benefits from additional Google Cloud features for enterprise security, safety, privacy and data governance and compliance. Android developers will also be able to build with Gemini Nano, our most efficient model for on-device tasks, via AICore, a new system capability available in Android 14, starting on Pixel 8 Pro devices. Sign up for an early preview of AICore. Gemini Ultra coming soon For Gemini Ultra, we’re currently completing extensive trust and safety checks, including red-teaming by trusted external parties, and further refining the model using fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) before making it broadly available. As part of this process, we’ll make Gemini Ultra available to select customers, developers, partners and safety and responsibility experts for early experimentation and feedback before rolling it out to developers and enterprise customers early next year. Early next year, we’ll also launch Bard Advanced, a new, cutting-edge AI experience that gives you access to our best models and capabilities, starting with Gemini Ultra. The Gemini era: enabling a future of innovation This is a significant milestone in the development of AI, and the start of a new era for us at Google as we continue to rapidly innovate and responsibly advance the capabilities of our models. We’ve made great progress on Gemini so far and we’re working hard to further extend its capabilities for future versions, including advances in planning and memory, and increasing the context window for processing even more information to give better responses. We’re excited by the amazing possibilities of a world responsibly empowered by AI — a future of innovation that will enhance creativity, extend knowledge, advance science and transform the way billions of people live and work around the world.

    "originLink": "https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-governments-surveil-push-notifications/",
    "originBody": "Apple Confirms Governments Using Push Notifications to Surveil Users Wednesday December 6, 2023 5:06 am PST by Tim Hardwick Unidentified governments are surveilling smartphone users by tracking push notifications that move through Google's and Apple's servers, a US senator warned on Wednesday (via Reuters). In a letter to the Department of Justice, Senator Ron Wyden said foreign officials were demanding the data from the tech giants to track smartphones. The traffic flowing from apps that send push notifications put the companies \"in a unique position to facilitate government surveillance of how users are using particular apps,\" Wyden said. He asked the Department of Justice to \"repeal or modify any policies\" that hindered public discussions of push notification spying. In a statement given to Reuters, Apple said that Wyden's letter gave them the opening they needed to share more details with the public about how governments monitored push notifications. \"In this case, the federal government prohibited us from sharing any information,\" the company said in a statement. \"Now that this method has become public we are updating our transparency reporting to detail these kinds of requests.\" According to the report, Wyden's letter said a \"tip\" was the source of the information about the surveillance. A source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for metadata related to push notifications. The data is said to have been used to attempt to tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts. Reuters' source would not identify which governments were making the data requests but described them as \"democracies allied to the United States.\" They did not know how long the requests had been going on for. Apple advises developers not to include sensitive data in notifications and to encrypt any data before adding it to a notification payload. However, this requires action on the developers' part. Likewise, metadata (like which apps are sending notifications and how often) is not encrypted, potentially giving anyone with access to the information insight into users' app usage.

    "title": "Rethinking serverless: Introducing the FLAME pattern for granular elastic scaling",
    "originLink": "https://fly.io/blog/rethinking-serverless-with-flame/",
    "originBody": "Author Name Chris McCord Twitter @chris_mccord Imagine if you could auto scale simply by wrapping any existing app code in a function and have that block of code run in a temporary copy of your app. The pursuit of elastic, auto-scaling applications has taken us to silly places. Serverless/FaaS had a couple things going for it. Elastic Scale™ is hard. It’s even harder when you need to manage those pesky servers. It also promised pay-what-you-use costs to avoid idle usage. Good stuff, right? Well the charade is over. You offload scaling concerns and the complexities of scaling, just to end up needing more complexity. Additional queues, storage, and glue code to communicate back to our app is just the starting point. Dev, test, and CI complexity balloons as fast as your costs. Oh, and you often have to rewrite your app in proprietary JavaScript – even if it’s already written in JavaScript! At the same time, the rest of us have elastically scaled by starting more webservers. Or we’ve dumped on complexity with microservices. This doesn’t make sense. Piling on more webservers to transcode more videos or serve up more ML tasks isn’t what we want. And granular scale shouldn’t require slicing our apps into bespoke operational units with their own APIs and deployments to manage. Enough is enough. There’s a better way to elastically scale applications. The FLAME pattern Here’s what we really want: We don’t want to manage those pesky servers. We already have this for our app deployments via fly deploy, git push heroku, kubectl, etc We want on-demand, granular elastic scale of specific parts of our app code We don’t want to rewrite our application or write parts of it in proprietary runtimes Imagine if we could auto scale simply by wrapping any existing app code in a function and have that block of code run in a temporary copy of the app. Enter the FLAME pattern. FLAME - Fleeting Lambda Application for Modular Execution With FLAME, you treat your entire application as a lambda, where modular parts can be executed on short-lived infrastructure. No rewrites. No bespoke runtimes. No outrageous layers of complexity. Need to insert the results of an expensive operation to the database? PubSub broadcast the result of some expensive work? No problem! It’s your whole app so of course you can do it. The Elixir flame library implements the FLAME pattern. It has a backend adapter for Fly.io, but you can use it on any cloud that gives you an API to spin up an instance with your app code running on it. We’ll talk more about backends in a bit, as well as implementing FLAME in other languages. First, lets watch a realtime thumbnail generation example to see FLAME + Elixir in action: Now let’s walk thru something a little more basic. Imagine we have a function to transcode video to thumbnails in our Elixir application after they are uploaded: def generate_thumbnails(%Video{} = vid, interval) do tmp = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), Ecto.UUID.generate()) File.mkdir!(tmp) args = [\"-i\", vid.url, \"-vf\", \"fps=1/#{interval}\", \"#{tmp}/%02d.png\"] System.cmd(\"ffmpeg\", args) urls = VidStore.put_thumbnails(vid, Path.wildcard(tmp\"/*.png\")) Repo.insert_all(Thumb, Enum.map(urls, &%{vid_id: vid.id, url: &1})) end Our generate_thumbnails function accepts a video struct. We shell out to ffmpeg to take the video URL and generate thumbnails at a given interval. We then write the temporary thumbnail paths to durable storage. Finally, we insert the generated thumbnail URLs into the database. This works great locally, but CPU bound work like video transcoding can quickly bring our entire service to a halt in production. Instead of rewriting large swaths of our app to move this into microservices or some FaaS, we can simply wrap it in a FLAME call: def generate_thumbnails(%Video{} = vid, interval) do FLAME.call(MyApp.FFMpegRunner, fn -> tmp = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), Ecto.UUID.generate()) File.mkdir!(tmp) args = [\"-i\", vid.url, \"-vf\", \"fps=1/#{interval}\", \"#{tmp}/%02d.png\"] System.cmd(\"ffmpeg\", args) urls = VidStore.put_thumbnails(vid, Path.wildcard(tmp\"/*.png\")) Repo.insert_all(Thumb, Enum.map(urls, &%{vid_id: vid.id, url: &1})) end) end That’s it! FLAME.call accepts the name of a runner pool, and a function. It then finds or boots a new copy of our entire application and runs the function there. Any variables the function closes over (like our %Video{} struct and interval) are passed along automatically. When the FLAME runner boots up, it connects back to the parent node, receives the function to run, executes it, and returns the result to the caller. Based on configuration, the booted runner either waits happily for more work before idling down, or extinguishes itself immediately. Let’s visualize the flow: We changed no other code and issued our DB write with Repo.insert_all just like before, because we are running our entire application. Database connection(s) and all. Except this fleeting application only runs that little function after startup and nothing else. In practice, a FLAME implementation will support a pool of runners for hot startup, scale-to-zero, and elastic growth. More on that later. Solving a problem vs removing the problem FaaS solutions help you solve a problem. FLAME removes the problem. The FaaS labyrinth of complexity defies reason. And it’s unavoidable. Let’s walkthrough the thumbnail use-case to see how. We try to start with the simplest building block like request/response AWS Lambda Function URL’s. The complexity hits immediately. We start writing custom encoders/decoders on both sides to handle streaming the thumbnails back to the app over HTTP. Phew that’s done. Wait, is our video transcoding or user uploads going to take longer than 15 minutes? Sorry, hard timeout limit – time to split our videos into chunks to stay within the timeout, which means more lambdas to do that. Now we’re orchestrating lambda workflows and relying on additional services, such as SQS and S3, to enable this. All the FaaS is doing is adding layers of communication between your code and the parts you want to run elastically. Each layer has its own glue integration price to pay. Ultimately handling this kind of use-case looks something like this: Trigger the lambda via HTTP endpoint, S3, or API gateway ($) Write the bespoke lambda to transcode the video ($) Place the thumbnail results into SQS ($) Write the SQS consumer in our app (dev $) Persist to DB and figure out how to get events back to active subscribers that may well be connected to other instances than the SQS consumer (dev $) This is nuts. We pay the FaaS toll at every step. We shouldn’t have to do any of this! FaaS provides a bunch of offerings to build a solution on top of. FLAME removes the problem entirely. FLAME Backends On Fly.io infrastructure the FLAME.FlyBackend can boot a copy of your application on a new Machine and have it connect back to the parent for work within ~3s. By default, FLAME ships with a LocalBackend and FlyBackend, but any host that provides an API to provision a server and run your app code can work as a FLAME backend. Erlang and Elixir primitives are doing all the heavy lifting here. The entire FLAME.FlyBackend istmp_file = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), Ecto.UUID.generate()) flame_stream = File.stream!(tmp_file) Enum.into(parent_stream, flame_stream) tmp = Path.join(System.tmp_dir!(), Ecto.UUID.generate()) File.mkdir!(tmp) args = [\"-i\", vid.url, \"-vf\", \"fps=1/#{interval}\", \"#{tmp}/%02d.png\"] System.cmd(\"ffmpeg\", args) urls = VidStore.put_thumbnails(vid, Path.wildcard(tmp\"/*.png\")) Repo.insert_all(Thumb, Enum.map(urls, &%{vid_id: vid.id, url: &1})) end) end On line 2 we open a file on the parent node to the video path. Then in the FLAME child, we stream the file from the parent node to the FLAME server in only a couple lines of code. That’s it! No setup of S3 or HTTP interfaces required. With FLAME it’s easy to miss everything we’re not doing: We don’t need to write code outside of our application. We can reuse business logic, database setup, PubSub, and all the features of our respective platforms We don’t need to manage deploys of separate services or endpoints We don’t need to write results to S3 or SQS just to pick up values back in our app We skip the dev, test, and CI dependency dance FLAME outside Elixir Elixir is fantastically well suited for the FLAME model because we get so much for free like process supervision and distributed messaging. That said, any language with reasonable concurrency primitives can take advantage of this pattern. For example, my teammate, Lubien, created a proof of concept example for breaking out functions in your JavaScript application and running them inside a new Fly Machine: https://github.com/lubien/fly-run-this-function-on-another-machine So the general flow for a JavaScript-based FLAME call would be to move the modular executions to a new file, which is executed on a runner pool. Provided the arguments are JSON serializable, the general FLAME flow is similar to what we’ve outlined here. Your application, your code, running on fleeting instances. A complete FLAME library will need to handle the following concerns: Elastic pool scale-up and scale-down logic Hot vs cold startup with pools Remote runner monitoring to avoid orphaned resources How to monitor and keep deployments fresh For the rest of this post we’ll see how the Elixir FLAME library handles these concerns as well as features uniquely suited to Elixir applications. But first, you might be wondering about your background job queues. What about my background job processor? FLAME works great inside your background job processor, but you may have noticed some overlap. If your job library handles scaling the worker pool, what is FLAME doing for you? There’s a couple important distinctions here. First, we reach for these queues when we need durability guarantees. We often can turn knobs to have the queues scale to handle more jobs as load changes. But durable operations are separate from elastic execution. Conflating these concerns can send you down a similar path to lambda complexity. Leaning on your worker queue purely for offloaded execution means writing all the glue code to get the data into and out of the job, and back to the caller or end-user’s device somehow. For example, if we want to guarantee we successfully generated thumbnails for a video after the user upload, then a job queue makes sense as the dispatch, commit, and retry mechanism for this operation. The actual transcoding could be a FLAME call inside the job itself, so we decouple the ideas of durability and scaled execution. On the other side, we have operations we don’t need durability for. Take the screencast above where the user hasn’t yet saved their video. Or an ML model execution where there’s no need to waste resources churning a prompt if the user has already left the app. In those cases, it doesn’t make sense to write to a durable store to pick up a job for work that will go right into the ether. Pooling for Elastic Scale With the Elixir implementation of FLAME, you define elastic pools of runners. This allows scale-to-zero behavior while also elastically scaling up FLAME servers with max concurrency limits. For example, lets take a look at the start/2 callback, which is the entry point of all Elixir applications. We can drop in a FLAME.Pool for video transcriptions and say we want it to scale to zero, boot a max of 10, and support 5 concurrent ffmpeg operations per runner: def start(_type, _args) do flame_parent = FLAME.Parent.get() children = [ ..., MyApp.Repo, {FLAME.Pool, name: Thumbs.FFMpegRunner, min: 0, max: 10, max_concurrency: 5, idle_shutdown_after: 30_000}, !flame_parent && MyAppWeb.Endpoint ] |> Enum.filter(& &1) opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor] Supervisor.start_link(children, opts) end We use the presence of a FLAME parent to conditionally start our Phoenix webserver when booting the app. There’s no reason to start a webserver if we aren’t serving web traffic. Note we leave other services like the database MyApp.Repo alone because we want to make use of those services inside FLAME runners. Elixir’s supervised process approach to applications is uniquely great for turning these kinds of knobs. We also set our pool to idle down after 30 seconds of no caller operations. This keeps our runners hot for a short while before discarding them. We could also pass a min: 1 to always ensure at least one ffmpeg runner is hot and ready for work by the time our application is started. Process Placement In Elixir, stateful bits of our applications are built around the process primitive – lightweight greenthreads with message mailboxes. Wrapping our otherwise stateless app code in a synchronous FLAME.call‘s or async FLAME.cast’s works great, but what about the stateful parts of our app? FLAME.place_child exists to take an existing process specification in your Elixir app and start it on a FLAME runner instead of locally. You can use it anywhere you’d use Task.Supervisor.start_child , DynamicSupervisor.start_child, or similar interfaces. Just like FLAME.call, the process is run on an elastic pool and runners handle idle down when the process completes its work. And like FLAME.call, it lets us take existing app code, change a single LOC, and continue shipping features. Let’s walk thru the example from the screencast above. Imagine we want to generate video thumbnails for a video as it is being uploaded. Elixir and LiveView make this easy. We won’t cover all the code here, but you can view the full app implementation. Our first pass would be to write a LiveView upload writer that calls into a ThumbnailGenerator: defmodule ThumbsWeb.ThumbnailUploadWriter do @behaviour Phoenix.LiveView.UploadWriter alias Thumbs.ThumbnailGenerator def init(opts) do generator = ThumbnailGenerator.open(opts) {:ok, %{gen: generator}} end def write_chunk(data, state) do ThumbnailGenerator.stream_chunk!(state.gen, data) {:ok, state} end def meta(state), do: %{gen: state.gen} def close(state, _reason) do ThumbnailGenerator.close(state.gen) {:ok, state} end end An upload writer is a behavior that simply ferries the uploaded chunks from the client into whatever we’d like to do with them. Here we have a ThumbnailGenerator.open/1 which starts a process that communicates with an ffmpeg shell. Inside ThumbnailGenerator.open/1, we use regular elixir process primitives: # thumbnail_generator.ex def open(opts \\\\ []) do Keyword.validate!(opts, [:timeout, :caller, :fps]) timeout = Keyword.get(opts, :timeout, 5_000) caller = Keyword.get(opts, :caller, self()) ref = make_ref() parent = self() spec = {__MODULE__, {caller, ref, parent, opts}} {:ok, pid} = DynamicSupervisor.start_child(@sup, spec) receive do {^ref, %ThumbnailGenerator{} = gen} -> %ThumbnailGenerator{genpid: pid} after timeout -> exit(:timeout) end end The details aren’t super important here, except line 10 where we call {:ok, pid} = DynamicSupervisor.start_child(@sup, spec), which starts a supervisedThumbnailGenerator process. The rest of the implementation simply ferries chunks as stdin into ffmpeg and parses png’s from stdout. Once a PNG delimiter is found in stdout, we send the caller process (our LiveView process) a message saying “hey, here’s an image”: # thumbnail_generator.ex @png_begin > defp handle_stdout(state, ref, bin) do %ThumbnailGenerator{ref: ^ref, caller: caller} = state.gen case bin do > -> if state.current do send(caller, {ref, :image, state.count, encode(state)}) end %{statecount: state.count + 1, current: [bin]} _ -> %{statecurrent: [binstate.current]} end end The caller LiveView process then picks up the message in a handle_info callback and updates the UI: # thumb_live.ex def handle_info({_ref, :image, _count, encoded}, socket) do %{count: count} = socket.assigns {:noreply, socket |> assign(count: count + 1, message: \"Generating (#{count + 1})\") |> stream_insert(:thumbs, %{id: count, encoded: encoded})} end The send(caller, {ref, :image, state.count, encode(state)} is one magic part about Elixir. Everything is a process, and we can message those processes, regardless of their location in the cluster. It’s like if every instantiation of an object in your favorite OO lang included a cluster-global unique identifier to work with methods on that object. The LiveView (a process) simply receives the image message and updates the UI with new images. Now let’s head back over to our ThumbnailGenerator.open/1 function and make this elastically scalable. - {:ok, pid} = DynamicSupervisor.start_child(@sup, spec) + {:ok, pid} = FLAME.place_child(Thumbs.FFMpegRunner, spec) That’s it! Because everything is a process and processes can live anywhere, it doesn’t matter what server our ThumbnailGenerator process lives on. It simply messages the caller with send(caller, …) and the messages are sent across the cluster if needed. Once the process exits, either from an explicit close, after the upload is done, or from the end-user closing their browser tab, the FLAME server will note the exit and idle down if no other work is being done. Check out the full implementation if you’re interested. Remote Monitoring All this transient infrastructure needs failsafe mechanisms to avoid orphaning resources. If a parent spins up a runner, that runner must take care of idling itself down when no work is present and handle failsafe shutdowns if it can no longer contact the parent node. Likewise, we need to shutdown runners when parents are rolled for new deploys as we must guarantee we’re running the same code across the cluster. We also have active callers in many cases that are awaiting the result of work on runners that could go down for any reason. There’s a lot to monitor here. There’s also a number of failure modes that make this sound like a harrowing experience to implement. Fortunately Elixir has all the primitives to make this an easy task thanks to the Erlang VM. Namely, we get the following for free: Process monitoring and supervision – we know when things go bad. Whether on a node-local process, or one across the cluster Node monitoring – we know when nodes come up, and when nodes go away Declarative and controlled app startup and shutdown - we carefully control the startup and shutdown sequence of applications as a matter of course. This allows us to gracefully shutdown active runners when a fresh deploy is triggered, while giving them time to finish their work We’ll cover the internal implementation details in a future deep-dive post. For now, feel free to poke around the flame source. What’s Next We’re just getting started with the Elixir FLAME library, but it’s ready to try out now. In the future look for more advance pool growth techniques, and deep dives into how the Elixir implementation works. You can also find me @chris_mccord to chat about implementing the FLAME pattern in your language of choice.

    "commentBody": "Rethinking serverless with FLAMEHacker NewspastloginRethinking serverless with FLAME (fly.io) 359 points by kiwicopple 21 hours ago| hidepastfavorite136 comments imafish 14 hours agoHaving dealt with the pain and complexity of a 100+ lambda function app for the last 4 years, I must say this post definitely hits the spot wrt. the downsides of FaaS serverless architectures.When starting out, these downsides are not really that visible. On the contrary, there is a very clear upside, which is that everything is free when you have low usage, and you have little to no maintenance.It is only later, when you have built a hot mess of lambda workflows, which become more and more rigid due to interdependencies, that you wish you had just gone the monolith route and spent the few extra hundreds on something self-managed. (Or even less now, e.g. on fly.io)A question for author: what if not using Elixir? reply hinkley 14 hours agoparentA pattern I see over and over, which has graduated to somewhere between a theorem and a law, is that motivated developers can make just about any process or architecture work for about 18 months.By the time things get bad, it&#x27;s almost time to find a new job, especially if the process was something you introduced a year or more into your tenure and are now regretting. I&#x27;ve seen it with a handful of bad bosses, at least half a dozen times with (shitty) &#x27;unit testing&#x27;, scrum, you name it.But what I don&#x27;t know is how many people are mentally aware of the sources of discomfort they feel at work, instead of a more nebulous \"it&#x27;s time to move on\". I certainly get a lot of pushback trying to name uncomfortable things (and have a lot less bad feelings about it now that I&#x27;ve read Good to Great). Nobody wants to say, \"Oh look, the consequences of my actions.\"The people materially responsible for the Rube Goldberg machine I help maintain were among the first to leave. The captain of that ship asked a coworker of mine if he thought it would be a good idea to open source our engine. He responded that nobody would want to use our system when the wheels it reinvented already exist (and are better). That guy was gone within three to four months, under his own steam. reply antod 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s why I&#x27;m always wary of people who hardly ever seem to stay anywhere more than a couple of years.There&#x27;s valuable learning (and empathy too) in having to see your own decisions and creations through their whole lifecycle. Understanding how tech debt comes to be, what tradeoffs were involved and how they came to bite later. Which ideas turned out to be bad in hindsight through the lens of the people making them at the time.Rather than just painting the previous crowd as incompetent while simultaneously making worse decisions you&#x27;ll never experience the consequences of.Moving on every 18-24 months leaves you with a potentially false impression of your own skills&#x2F;wisdom. reply no_wizard 8 hours agorootparent>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m always wary of people who hardly ever seem to stay anywhere more than a couple of yearsDo have some empathy for when job markets or life make people move on. I&#x27;d like to stay at an employer for more than 1-2 years, but between the layoffs (avoiding them or getting laid off) or the need for a higher salary that often only comes from switching jobs, its not always possible to build tenure.Frankly its a big issue in the industry at large. I hate interviewing etc. but I&#x27;m not going to get paid 20% less because of it. I had to ride the job hopping treadmill for awhile, and I&#x27;d like to get off it just as much as you&#x27;d like to see people have more tenure.When I first started out though, I worked for 5 years at the same place until it was very clear I was going to cap out on being able to advance and merit increases of 3-5% a year aren&#x27;t going to cut it. reply Aqua_Geek 7 hours agorootparentYep. Absolutely this. I get the frustration of people building fragile junk and bouncing before the house of cards falls, but I wouldn’t hold switching jobs every couple of years against a candidate when a significant difference in salary is potentially on the table. A 20% raise, compounded over a couple of switches, is massive.I got way more by switching jobs (after 4 years) than I was ever going to get by staying. reply hinkley 7 hours agorootparentprevIt definitely colors which questions I want to ask people.It is possible to avoid these traps, but then there are a lot of traps that we collectively have the wisdom to avoid but individually do not.I started taking things apart and putting them back together at a very young age. When I was a young man I was in a big hurry to get somewhere, and so I could walk into a brownfield project and slowly reconstruct and deconstruct how we got here, would I have made the same decisions with the same information, and how do I feel about this news. Not only was I not falling into the \"1 year of experience 10 times\" dilema, I got more like 3-4 years of experience 4 times in 10 years, by playing historian.My first almost-mentor left me with a great parting gift at the start of the dot-com era. He essentially convinced me of the existence of the hype cycle (in &#x27;95!), that we were at the beginning of one&#x2F;several, he had seen previous ones play out, and they would play out again. Not cycles for new things, mind you, but cycles trying to bring back old things that had been forgotten. Like fashion. If anything it made me more likely to want to excavate the site.Going into the trap knowing it&#x27;s a trap doesn&#x27;t necessarily save you, but it does improve your odds. Of course it also makes you a curmudgeon at a tender age. reply jvans 10 hours agorootparentprev> There&#x27;s valuable learning (and empathy too) in having to see your own decisions and creations through their whole lifecycle.This is so true. It&#x27;s extremely enlightening to watch a design go from design docs to implementation and then finally the maintenance phase. A lot of problems that could happen never do and some unexpected ones pop up along the way. reply katzgrau 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd don’t forget that the developer fought like hell to use that new process, architecture, pattern, framework, etc reply hinkley 7 hours agorootparentI have spent so much time fighting to do things the boring way.There&#x27;s only so much interesting code you can add to interesting code, before every single conversation becomes a proxy discussion of The Mythical Man Month - we can&#x27;t teach anybody new how to use this code in anything like a reasonable time frame. The best we can do is create new experts as fast as the old ones disappear.Really Interesting Code is more at home surrounded by Really Fucking Boring code. You get so blinded by the implementation details of the Interesting Code that you cannot see the forest for the trees. That is the secret wisdom of Relentless Refactoring. The more I rearrange the pieces the more things I can see that can be made out of them, some of which are better, and a few of which are much better or brilliant.Last week I implemented something in 2 days that we wanted years ago and didn&#x27;t do because it would have taken more than a month of 1.5 people working on it to fix. But after a conversation in which I enumerated all the little islands of sanity I had created between Here and There, it took a couple dozen lines of code to fix a very old and very sore problem. reply Rapzid 9 hours agoparentprevYou can monolith on lamba if you don&#x27;t care too much about cold starts or can manage it..Put another way, you can monolith and minimize spend on AWS; it&#x27;s not either or.I&#x27;m using asp.net these days and even a chunky app published ready to run with optimized ef models starts relatively quickly. reply chrismccord 14 hours agoparentprevI talk about FLAME outside elixir in one one of the sections in the blog. The tldr; is it&#x27;s a generally applicable pattern for languages with a reasonable concurrency model. You likely won&#x27;t get all the ergonomics that we get for free like functions with captured variable serialization, but you can probably get 90% of the way there in something like js, where you can move your modular execution to a new file rather than wrapping it in a closure. Someone implementing a flame library will also need to write the pooling, monitoring, and remote communication bits. We get a lot for free in Elixir on the distributed messaging and monitoring side. The process placement stuff is also really only applicable to Elixir.

If you use the C#&#x2F;v4 model, I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;d have a hard time. Azure even sets up the CI&#x2F;CD for you automatically if your functions are hosted in Github.If your functions need to talk to SQL, you should be using Managed Identity authentication between these resources.

Because it’s a terrible experience.I think our “best” issue is how sometimes our functions won’t be capable of connecting to their container registry. For no apparent reason. We have an Entra ID group that has Arc Pull access and we add new function slot identities to it automatically, and for the most part it works fine, but then suddenly it won’t.We currently has a pipeline slot, that is completely the same as the four other slots, which will only deploy a new function version if you deploy it twice through the Azure pipeline. We’ve had Microsoft look at it and their suggestion was to delete the pipeline and create it again.And that’s just part of it. Then comes the VNETs, the subnets the private endpoints and how both subscriptions and resource groups make everything a tiny battle.I don’t really mind that much, we’re abandoning it in favour of Azure Container Apps and a fully run Bicep + Dapr pipeline and we’re never looking back.Though, to be fair to Microsoft, the way they designed Azure Functions makes the migration away from them really, really, easy. Which is frankly a brilliant design for the more managed side of “serverless” in my opinions. It’s just a shame that the managed part just doesn’t work very well.

Great work reply rubenfiszel 16 hours agoprevThat&#x27;s great. I agree with the whole thesis.We took an alternative approach with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.windmill.dev which is to consider the unit of abstraction to be at the source code level rather than the container level. We then parse the main function, and imports to extract the args and dependencies, and then run the code as is in the desired runtime (typescript, python, go, bash). Then all the secret sauce is to manage the cache efficiently so that the workers are always hot regardless of your importsIt&#x27;s not as integrated in the codebase as this, but the audience is different, our users build complex workflows from scratch, cron jobs, or just one-off scripts with the auto-generated UI. Indeed the whole context in FLAME seems to be snapshotted and then rehydrated on the target VM. Another approach would be to introduce syntax to specify what is required context from what is not and only loading the minimally required.

Another approach would be to introduce syntax to specify what is required context from what is not and only loading the minimally required.This isn&#x27;t strictly what is happening. FLAME just uses the BEAM&#x27;s built in clustering features to call a function on a remote node. That implicitly handles transferring only the context that is necessary. From the article:> FLAME.call accepts the name of a runner pool, and a function. It then finds or boots a new copy of our entire application and runs the function there. Any variables the function closes over (like our %Video{} struct and interval) are passed along automatically. reply rubenfiszel 16 hours agorootparentFair point, TIL about another incredible capability of the BEAM. As long as you&#x27;re willing to write Elixir, this is clearly a superior scheme for deferred tasks&#x2F;background jobs.One issue I see with this scheme still is that you have to be careful of what you do at initialization of the app since now all your background jobs are gonna run that. For instance, maybe your task doesn&#x27;t need to be connected to the db and as per the article it will if your app does. They mention having hot-modules, but what if you want to run 1M of those jobs on 100 workers, you now have a 100 unnecessary apps.

Is there a way to pass along that data or for it to be pulled from the parent?Acknowledging this is brand new; just curious what your thinking is.EDIT: Would it go in the pool config, and a runner as a member of the pool has access to that? reply chrismccord 15 hours agorootparentGood question. The pools themselves in your app will be per usecase, and you can reference the named pool you are a part of inside the runner, ie by looking in system env passed as pool options. That said, we should probably just encode the pool name along with the other parent info in the `%FLAME.Parent{}` for easier lookup reply jrmiii 12 hours agorootparentAh, that makes a lot of sense - I think the FLAME.Parent{} approach may enable backends that wouldn&#x27;t be possible otherwise.For example, if I used the heroku api to do the equivalent of ps:scale to boot up more nodes - those new nodes (dynos in heroku parlance) could see what kind of pool members they are. I don&#x27;t think there is a way to do dyno specific env vars - they apply at the app level.If anyone tries to do a Heroku backend before I do, an alternative might be to use distinct process types in the Procfile for each named pool and ps:scale those to 0 or more.Also, might need something like Supabase&#x27;s libcluster_postgres[1] to fully pull it off.EDIT2: So the heroku backend would be a challenge. You&#x27;d maybe have to use something like the formation api[2] to spawn the pool, but even then you can&#x27;t idle them down because Heroku will try to start them back.

Runners are pooled and remain configurable hot for whatever time you want before idling down. Under load you are rarely paying the cold start time because the pool is already hot. We are also adding more sophisticated pool growth techniques to the Elixir library next so you also avoid hitting an at capacity runner and cold starting one.For hot runners, the only overhead is the latency between the parent and child, which should be the same datacenter so 1ms or sub 1ms. reply solatic 14 hours agorootparentCold start time is the issue with most serverless runtimes.Your own mission statement states: \"We want on-demand, granular elastic scale of specific parts of our app code.\" Doing that correctly is fundamentally a question of how long you need to wait for cold starts, because if you have a traffic spike, the spiked part of the traffic is simply not being served until the cold start period elapses. If you&#x27;re running hot runners with no load, or if you have incoming load without runners (immediately) serving them, then you&#x27;re not really delivering on your goal here. AWS EC2 has had autoscaling groups for more than a decade, and of course, a VM is essentially a more elaborate wrapper for any kind of application code you can write, and one with a longer cold-start time.> Under load you are rarely paying the cold start time because the pool is already hot.My spiky workloads beg to differ. reply bo0tzz 14 hours agorootparentDepending of course on the workload and request volume, I imagine you could apply a strategy where code is run locally while waiting for a remote node to start up, so you can still serve the requests on time? reply solatic 13 hours agorootparentNo, because then you&#x27;re dividing the resources allocated to the function among the existing run + the new run. If you over-allocate ahead of time to accommodate for this, you might as well just run ordinary VMs, which always have excess allocation locally; the core idea of scaling granularly is that you only allocate the resources you need for that single execution (paying a premium compared to a VM but less overall for spiky workloads since less overhead will be wasted). reply conradfr 12 hours agorootparentprevIn a Elixir&#x2F;Phoenix app I don&#x27;t think this will be really used for web traffic and more for background&#x2F;async jobs. reply bo0tzz 16 hours agorootparentprevCurrently the per-runner concurrency is limited by a fixed number.

It reminds me of a (very lightweight) Elixir specific version of what we built at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inngest.com&#x2F;.That is, we both make your existing code available to serverless functions by wrapping with something that, essentially, makes the code callable via remote-RPC .Some things to consider, which are called out in the blog post:Often code like this runs in a series of imperative steps. Each of these steps can run in series or parallel as additional lambdas. However, there&#x27;s implicit state captured in variables between steps. This means that functions become workflows. In the Inngest model, Inngest captures this state and injects it back into the function so that things are durable.On the note of durability, these processes should also be backed by a queue. The good thing about this model is that queues are cheap. When you make queues cheap (eg. one line of code) everything becomes easy: any developer can write reliable code without worrying about infra.Monitoring and observability, as called out, is critical. Dead letter queues suck absolute major heaving amounts of nauseous air, and being able to manage and replay failing functions or steps is critical.A couple differences wrt. FLAME and Inngest. Inngest is queue backed, event-driven, and servable via HTTP across any language. Because Inngest backs your state externally, you can write a workflow in Elixir, rewrite it in Typescript, redeploy, and running functions live migrate across backend languages, similar to CRIU.Being event-driven allows you to manage flow control: everything from debounce to batching to throttling to fan-out, across any runtime or language (eg. one Elixir app on Fly can send an event over to run functions on TypeScript + Lambda).I&#x27;m excited where FLAME goes. I think there are similar goals! reply chrismccord 17 hours agoparentIngest looks like an awesome service! I talk about job processors&#x2F;durability&#x2F;retries in the post. For Elixir specifically for durability, retries, and workflows we reach for Oban, which we&#x27;d continue to do here. The Oban job would call into FLAME to handle the elastic execution. reply darwin67 16 hours agorootparentFYI: there&#x27;s an Elixir SDK for Inngest as well.

Curious to see how it handles the server parts of serverless like environment variables, db connection counts, etc.One potential gotcha I&#x27;m curious if there is a good story for is if it can guard against code that depends on other processes in the local supervision tree. I&#x27;m assuming since it&#x27;s talking about Ecto inserts it brings over and starts the whole apps supervision tree on the function executor but that may or may not be desired for various reasons. reply chrismccord 18 hours agoparentIt starts your whole app, including the whole supervision tree, but you can turn on&#x2F;off services based on whatever logic you want. I talk a bit about this in the screencast. For example, no need to start the phoenix endpoint (webserver) since we aren&#x27;t serving web traffic. For the DB pool, you&#x27;d set a lower pool size or single connection in your runtime configuration based on the presence of FLAME parent or not. reply agundy 18 hours agorootparentOh cool!

Looking forward to it. reply sofixa 18 hours agoprevVery interesting concept, however it&#x27;s a bit soured by the fact that Container-based FaaS is never mentioned, and it removes a decent chunk of the negatives around FaaS. Yeah you still need to deal with the communication layer (probably with managed services such as SQS or Pub&#x2F;Sub), but there&#x27;s no proprietary runtime needed, no rewrites needed between local&#x2F;remote runtime environments. reply chrismccord 18 hours agoparentBring-your-own-container is certainly better than proprietary js runtimes, but as you said it carries every other negative I talk about in the post. You get to run your language of choice, but you&#x27;re still doing all the nonsense. And you need to reach for the mound of proprietary services to actually ship features.

So active processes&#x2F;calls&#x2F;casts are given a configurable amount of time to finish and no more work is accepted by the runner.If you&#x27;re talking about a FLAME.call at app shutdown that hasn&#x27;t yet reached the runner, it will follow the same app shutdown flows of the rest of your code and eventually drop into the ether like any other code path you have. If you want durability you&#x27;d reach for your job queue (like Oban in Elixir) under the same considerations as regular app code.

Do they communicate in the same region and share the pools? Or are Flame pools strictly children of each individual parent? Does it make a difference in pricing or anything else to run on hot workers instead of starting up per parent?What would you recommend the setup be in such a case?Aside: I really liked the idea of Flame with Fly. It&#x27;s a really neat implementation for a neat platform! reply chrismccord 13 hours agoparent> Or are Flame pools strictly children of each individual parent?Confirm. Each parent node runs its own pool. There is no global coordination by design.> Does it make a difference in pricing or anything else to run on hot workers instead of starting up per parent?A lot would depend on what you are doing, the size of runner machines you decide to start in your pools (which can be different sizes from the app or other pools), etc. In general Elixir scales well enough that you aren&#x27;t going to be running your app in every possible region. You&#x27;ll be in a handful of regions servicing traffic in those regions and the load each region has. You could build in your own global coordination on top, ie try to find processes running on the cluster already (which could be running in a FLAME runner), but you&#x27;re in distributed systems land and it All Depends™ what you&#x27;re building the tradeoffs you want. reply timenova 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the reply!Can I suggest adding some docs to Fly to run Flame apps? To cover the more complex aspects of integrating with Fly, such as running Flame machines with a different size compared to the parent nodes, what kind of fly.toml config works and doesn&#x27;t work with Flame, such as the auto_start and auto_stop configurations on the parent based on the number of requests, and anything else particularly important to remember with Fly. reply guluarte 9 hours agoprevCompanies should pay 1Mm everytime they use a new acronym reply davidjfelix 18 hours agoprevThis is a very neat approach and I agree with the premise that we need a framework that unifies some of the architecture of cloud - shuttle.rs has some thoughts here. I do take issue with this framing:- Trigger the lambda via HTTP endpoint, S3, or API gateway ($) * Pretending that starting a fly machine doesn&#x27;t cost the same as triggering via s3 seems disingenuous.- Write the bespoke lambda to transcode the video ($) * In go this would be about as difficult as flame -- you&#x27;d have to build a different entrypoint that would be 1 line of code but it could be the same codebase. Node it would depend on bundling but in theory you could do the same -- it&#x27;s just a promise that takes an S3 event, that doesn&#x27;t seem much different.- Place the thumbnail results into SQS ($) * I wouldn&#x27;t do this at all. There&#x27;s no reason the results need to be queued. Put them in a deterministically named s3 bucket where they&#x27;ll live and be served from. Period.- Write the SQS consumer in our app (dev $) * Again -- this is totally unnecessary. Your application *should forget* it dispatched work. That&#x27;s the point of dispatching it. If you need subscribers to notice it or do some additional work I&#x27;d do it differently rather than chaining lambdas.- Persist to DB and figure out how to get events back to active subscribers that may well be connected to other instances than the SQS consumer (dev $) * Your lambda really should be doing the DB work not your main application. If you&#x27;ve got subscribers waiting to be informed the lambda can fire an SNS notification and all subscribed applications will see \"job 1234 complete\"So really the issue is:* s3 is our image database* our app needs to deploy an s3 hook for lambda* our codebase needs to deploy that lambda* we might need to listen to SNSwhich is still some complexity, but it&#x27;s not the same and it&#x27;s not using the wrong technology like some chain of SQS nonsense. reply chrismccord 18 hours agoparentThanks for the thoughts – hopefully I can make this more clear:> * Pretending that starting a fly machine doesn&#x27;t cost the same as triggering via s3 seems disingenuous.You&#x27;re going to be paying for resources wherever you decide to run your code. I don&#x27;t think this needs to be spelled out. The point about costs is rather than paying to run \"my app\", I&#x27;m paying at multiple layers to run a full solution to my problem.

All my local dev I just do on Windows reply sgarland 19 hours agorootparentprevBecause they are not concerned with those things, the lack of knowledge in those areas creeps in.If you don’t understand how the OS works at a very fundamental level, you will write sub-optimal code. This is usually fine, because people are smart, compilers are good, and hardware is absurdly fast. However, the fact remains that it’s probably giving up some bits here and there.More germane to my point, though, the amount of libraries and tooling and abstractions being spun up to avoid having to run a server seems like more effort than its worth. Serverless sometimes has cost merits, but as a counterpoint, you can get a 1 year RI micro EC2 for something like $3&#x2F;month. If your app is struggling to run on that, either you have the scale to justify more cash outlay, or your app has performance issues – and now we’re full circle back to the previous paragraph. reply quaunaut 19 hours agorootparentAll true, but you&#x27;ve got a few issues:- Flame still assumes you have a server somewhere- this is purely for elastic workloads.- Dynamically scaling horizontally is not something \"linux\" can do for you: It&#x27;s a legitimately hard problem because of all the usual distributed systems difficulties.- Often, there are workloads that are only needed occasionally but also have very different resource needs than the rest of the system. Being forced to not only create a new version of your application, but additionally a bespoke server setup and dedicated VM&#x2F;Container image for that case takes something that could be trivial in the Flame model, and makes it take hours even for someone experienced.Basically, you really should&#x27;ve read the article first. reply sgarland 17 hours agorootparent> Dynamically scaling horizontally is not something \"linux\" can do for youIt can, depending on your definition of horizontal, and whether you accept that tools like HAProxy fall under the realm of “Linux administration.”systemd can spawn N services from a single definition file, which can then register with the load balancer. A small shell script could monitor those service cgroups for basic metrics like memory or CPU utilization, and then command systemd to scale up&#x2F;down. This is horizontal from the app’s perspective.I’m not suggesting the above is a great idea, and you’d probably be better off with container orchestration of some kind – but tbf, all that’s doing is encapsulating cgroups and monitoring consumption to command scaling. reply shortrounddev2 19 hours agorootparentprevThe cost you are trying to save is not infrastructure, or compute time, it&#x27;s labor.

I’m also a huge fan of simplicity.My advice to anyone starting out on a purely web adventure: run your monolith on lambda. Just upload your whole app as your lambda.

Spin up a relational database or maybe an auto scaling group.But start with a monolith on lambda.

In addition to focusing on their core stack, they would also need to deal with Lambda details and its restrictions. How would they work around the 15 minute execution limit, for one?My advice would be to start with a plain old monolith. Even launch with it. Once, and if, you have workloads that a) make sense to run as an isolated function, and b) would help offload some processing from your main app, consider splitting it and using a Lambda.Doing so prematurely, or worse, starting with it, opens the door to complexity you just don&#x27;t need early on. reply jedberg 9 hours agorootparentYou shouldn’t need to run anything more than a minute or two.

Or need some specific integration or workflow that doesn&#x27;t fit the Lambda model? It would be very expensive to backtrack and implement a traditional architecture at that point, instead of starting with the traditional architecture and using Lambda only when you have a good use case for it.Not to mention that you&#x27;re going all in with a single cloud provider.

Shows disappearing from streaming services is commonplace, but in this case, people are losing access to shows they bought to watch on demand whenever they wanted. Then, on Monday, many users were unexpectedly banned from their PlayStation Network accounts, meaning that not only were they blocked from playing multiplayer games or using cloud streaming but they were also locked out of games they purchased digitally from Sony’s PlayStation marketplace. Affected users who may have spent years building a robust digital library were suddenly left without access to content they had bought through no fault of their own. It appears that Sony has since restored account access to people who were accidentally banned, but the company hasn’t explained what happened or said how it might prevent similar unexpected bans in the future. (Sony hasn’t replied to our multiple requests for comment.) Related After unexplained bans, PlayStation users report their accounts have been restored This is why we can’t have nice [full seasons of Auction Kings]. The ephemerality of digital “ownership” isn’t a new issue. Even though downloading and accessing digital content is often easier than trudging to a retail store to buy a physical copy of a game, you’re putting your faith in the platform holders to maintain their digital storefronts, the content on those storefronts, and their account systems so that your access keeps working. The recent closure of Nintendo’s Wii U and 3DS eShops was a stark reminder that companies have the power to decide when you can buy digital content. While you can still redownload Wii U and 3DS games that you’ve purchased, it seems inevitable that Nintendo will stop letting you do that one day. (It’s already planning to shut down online services for those platforms, after all.) And remember when Google shut down Stadia? I’m considering switching back to physical games. Photo by James Bareham / The Verge These recent PlayStation incidents are more aggravating, however, because of how sudden and seemingly unfair they are. With the Discovery content, Sony is giving users a matter of weeks to watch their purchased shows for the last time before the shows are yanked from their library entirely. And Sony isn’t offering any compensation for titles you’ve already bought or a way to transfer those purchases to another store. The PlayStation account bans were as swift as they were unexpected, and while resolution for most arrived within a few hours, Sony still hasn’t shared any public communication about what happened or why users should continue to trust the platform. I’ve been all in on digital content for years. I don’t like the clutter of physical boxes, and I enjoy being able to switch games and movies without having to get off the couch. But after seeing more instances of companies removing “purchased” digital content — essentially making things I buy digitally a long-term rental — I’m seriously considering going back to buying discs and cartridges.

    "originBody": "An Open Letter to the Python Software Foundation December 05, 2023 Dear PSF, We, organisers in the pan-African Python community, would like to raise some concerns and frustrations that have been brought to a head by recent events. We held the first-ever DjangoCon Africa in November, a flagship event for our community, and the first Africa-wide Python event since 2019’s PyCon Africa. The PSF Board approved a grant of USD 9000 for the conference (six days, 200 people). The event was a significant success, and the PSF’s support was key to that. Delays in the grant award process As acknowledged in the PSF’s article, “September & October Board Votes”, there were however some problems leading up to the grant decision. First, the Grants Working Group was unable to come to a consensus on the request, so the decision was passed to the PSF Board. The Board was also unable to come to a consensus in its September meeting. Finally in the Board’s October meeting, the grant was approved. That was just a few weeks before the event started, nearly three months after its submission. Effect of the delays We would like to share a statement from the organisers of DjangoCon Africa describing the effect of these delays on the event and on them personally. For a considerable period of time, we were in doubt about a significant portion of our expected conference budget - from the PSF, whom we expected to be a steadfast ally and backer. During that time, we felt quite stuck - unable to make decisions. Our daily conversations became centred around anxious what-if calculations. At one point we had reduced our budget for catering to a total of 5 USD per person per day, for breakfast, lunch and refreshments - even in Zanzibar, this is an unfeasibly low figure. We jettisoned one item after another from our budget. We were unable to make decisions about financial assistance, which in turn delayed our ability to make decisions about the programme (how could we invite a speaker whom we knew would require some funds to travel if we couldn’t provide the funds?). We watched as the air-fares we had expected to cover for many of those people rose. We had to answer all the people who couldn’t understand why we hadn’t decided on their talk proposals and grant applications, or who wondered why an event starting so soon had not yet even published a programme of talks. “What are we supposed to say to these people?” became another anxious topic in our meetings. We felt unable to advertise or promote the event, because we simply didn’t know what we could promise people. Some of the people affected had applied for visas - incurring expense - well in advance, on our advice; they too were waiting to hear back from us. Locally, we had caterers and other businesses waiting for deposits and confirmation of contracts. Some lost patience with us. The local PyCon Tanzania organisation bore the brunt of this. The organisation of DjangoCon Africa must have looked lazy, or incompetent, or worse, to someone looking at it from the outside. The delay in a decision on funding from the PSF also made it harder for us to approach other organisations for funds - “Is the PSF sponsoring DjangoCon Africa? Why not?”. It’s hard to describe the embarrassment we felt sometimes. We had sleepless nights with worry - literally, not figuratively. More than one of us confided in another that we wished we had never started the project. We started a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe to help cover the cost of financial assistance. It was a comfort to know that members of the international Python/Django community would stand up to support us, but the pleasure and gratitude we felt about that was overlaid with a feeling of humiliation that once again, a major African open-source software event had been obliged to publicly extend a begging-bowl. At one point, gaps in our funding meant that the organisers faced a personal liability of almost USD 10,000 - funds actually spent, or committed, to make the event possible. For any volunteer conference organiser, the weeks in the run-up to an event are full of hard work. This experience went far beyond that. Much of the pride and joy of staging DjangoCon Africa was sucked out of it for us. Eventually, we received the grant funding we had applied for, though even this seemed to come with a humiliation: it happened after a white European spoke up publicly on behalf of the African Python community. By the time we were able to start taking care of travellers who needed financial assistance, many of the air tickets had gone up significantly in price. Amongst the hard choices we had to make: one of our own organisers - a student, who has worked tirelessly in multiple events - was unable to attend because we could not afford to pay for her travel. The organisers personally contributed well over USD 4000 to make the event possible in the form it took - funds contributed to a cause that we believe in, but it is not right that volunteer organisers of community events should be forced to make such choices. We are genuinely grateful for the support we received from the PSF. The event was a success, and we are proud of what we achieved, but we remain perplexed and hurt by the problems we faced, and how our grant request was treated. Problems within the PSF? It’s not clear to the wider African Python community why events unfolded in this way, though we are aware of some things that we have found very troubling. We know that there are some extraordinary attitudes at work within the PSF. A PSF Board member once openly expressed the opinion that Anglo cultures always seem to be the ones that take the moral lead around the world, leaving others to follow their example. From any non-western perspective, this is an astounding idea to receive. In the case of DjangoCon Africa, the first public response to our event on Mastodon was a negative response from a PSF Director, that in effect, cast doubt on the whole idea of a DjangoCon in Tanzania. That’s not a solitary episode. We understand that (notwithstanding the PSF’s ambition to support Python in Africa) a PSF Director has consistently spoken out against funding for African events, over a period of years. Our grant request was handled by the PSF’s Grants Working Group. We understand that one member of this group was able effectively to stall its decision-making long enough that the grant request had to be passed to the PSF Board. At the PSF Board meeting in September 2023, a board member strategically used an abstention to ensure that a resolution to support our request could not pass. (Under the PSF rules, had they voted against the resolution, it would have passed 4-1. In the circumstances, other abstentions for different reasons - including one person who was required to abstain, as an organiser of DjangoCon Africa - meant that the resolution could not pass.) We are genuinely shocked by this. It’s one thing for a PSF Board member to vote against something they don’t believe in. It is quite another that someone has been able to weaponise the PSF’s voting system against an African event. We are deeply troubled that such behaviours and values are actively at work inside the PSF. As an organisation, the PSF (and its Board and Working Groups and their processes) should be robust enough to stand up to individual prejudices, and not allow decision-making and deliberation to be derailed by individuals, however influential. The PSF and marginalised and at-risk groups We understand that the argument against support for DjangoCon Africa was that the host country, Tanzania, is not a safe place for the LGBTQIA+ community. The PSF represents a global community, and has for years upheld high standards of inclusion and protection, paying special attention to the needs of those in marginalised and at-risk groups. Python community events around the world are effective safe spaces, that give strength to people who do not always find guarantees of safety elsewhere. It is therefore especially shocking to have observed an attempt, coming from within the PSF, to pit the well-being and interests of two different excluded groups against each other, as if somehow the interests of members of the LGBTQIA+ community and of Africans are mutually exclusive. Many questions can be asked about this reasoning. What counts as “safety”? Which places in the world are truly safe for LGBTQIA+ community? How much of a city, or state, or country needs to be LGBTQIA+ hostile for the whole of it to be declared unworthy of PSF support? What does the PSF have to say to LGBTQIA+ community members in such locations? Are the LGBTQIA+ communities who are worthy of the PSF’s consideration only those who live in western countries, or do others count too? What does the PSF have to say to Python community organisers around the world who assert the community’s standards of inclusion, even in countries where it takes an act of bravery to do so? And we would like to ask: when have questions been raised to check on whether western events present potential safety risks to non-western attendees, and when have non-western people been asked for their experiences? All across the world, including the west, there are countries and places that are genuinely unsafe for members of particular groups, on the basis of their religion, ethnicity, language, gender, sexuality, nationality and other characteristics. Some of these risks may be obvious to westerners, or native English speakers, or men, and some of them may not. Simplistic judgements made from narrow perspectives will not enhance the safety of anyone in our community. Risk and the law The PSF and its directors quite correctly also observe the laws that apply to them. Yet we have witnessed discussions in which it has been proposed that volunteer organisers take public stances in their own countries that are not just contentious or socially unacceptable, but would actually violate local laws. In one recent example, voices on the PSF Board were demanding that a condition of funding for a particular PyCon be the formal adoption of a “human rights plan” - a measure that would pose a significant legal and personal risk to its organisers. The entitlement and assumption of cultural superiority embodied in these ideas are absurd and offensive. Guidance and consideration for non-western Python events grant awards At a meeting earlier this year, the PSF expressed concern that barely 16% of grants go to African communities. At the same time, the perception within some African Python communities is that the PSF is less likely to award a grant to an African event, or will scrutinise it more harshly, or take longer to make an award. For example, in 2019 and 2020 one Ugandan Python community made two grant requests that we understand received literally no response. In 2022, another grant request finally received attention from the working group when - with the event coming up in a matter of days - one of the PSF Directors connected to the community raised the issue with PSF staff, and a vote was initiated immediately. This can be contrasted with the way a grant request for a European event was handled, at around the same time; the European request was made later, and dealt with sooner. Inconsistency, lack of transparency and lack of clarity around expectations serve to undermine trust and confidence. The general perception within the Ugandan Python community is now that their events will only be given consideration if a PSF Director happens to take a personal interest in it. In fact, other African organisers have reported timely responses and good communication from the PSF, so what is happening here? Do some African grant requests lack quality or detail, because organisers failed to understand what was required? Are there enough people in the PSF with an adequate understanding of the challenges faced by non-western events? Is there a pattern where weaknesses in a grant request made from some regions in the world are given the benefit of the doubt, while others are treated less favourably? We simply don’t know, and there could be a whole range of explanations. Whatever the underlying reasons, we need to understand and work together to address them, because the effects are harmful. Our requests to the Python Software Foundation Transparency We request that the PSF undertake and publish a review of actual grant applications, to determine whether there indeed are differences in grant responsiveness, approval times, rejection rates and so on in response to requests from different regions. We would like the PSF to publish clear expectations of timelines for handling grant requests, and for each final decision to be accompanied by a report showing how the case was actually handled. Guidance and feedback Organisers, and especially those operating without the benefit of long-standing networks of knowledge and shared expectations, need more guidance, and feedback they can act upon, especially in the case when a grant is rejected. We ask that the PSF commits to developing - in collaboration with organisers, especially those in non-western regions - further materials and guidance to help organisers put in the best possible requests for funding. This could include a more proactive approach to working with those organisers to help them understand the PSF’s expectations and standards. We request that the PSF institute a practice of providing clear feedback to grant applicants, to help improve and motivate subsequent applications. In cases of delay or doubt, we would like a practice of prompt, direct engagement with organisers to help clarify. Understanding of global needs We ask that the PSF as an organisation commits to a better understanding of global diversity and the realities, needs and challenges of non-western events and organisers. This includes an understanding of financial realities. For example, the organisers of African events face the combined difficulties of lesser commercial sponsorship prospects, the expense of intra-African travel, vast geographical distances and so on. We need the PSF to understand these realities in its decision-making about financial awards to events. The law and marginalised groups We request that the PSF undertake a formal review of policies and bylaws, that incorporates expert legal advice and takes full account of the realities of laws and legal regimes across the world that apply to volunteer Python community organisers. We recognise that all across the world, Python events are proposed in places where laws and practices mean that the rights of some individuals will be in jeopardy. We would like the PSF to recognise, formally and in its actual practices, that this includes the west, and that it is not only non-western events that should be subjected to critical scrutiny over this. We also ask the PSF to adopt a constructive stance that requires all local organisers, wherever they may be, to consider the safeguarding of marginalised groups, and actively helps them improve safety, without ever demanding that volunteers be willing to violate local law or place themselves at risk while doing unpaid work on behalf of the PSF. Progress, prejudice and confidence In the past ten years, Python in Africa has developed with remarkable speed and success. In 2014 there was just one African PyCon, in South Africa. Since then PyCons and other events have been held all over the continent, and the communities behind them have grown in size, confidence, expertise and influence. We can trace the introduction of Python teaching in universities across Africa and its spread across multiple commercial and non-commercial sectors to our work. We have been generously supported, financially and morally, by the Python Software Foundation. Leaders like Ewa Jodlowska and Naomi Ceder have been part of that growth due to intentional support for our communities. This has been a story of growth, motivation and courage. More recent experiences have left us feeling hurt and angry. We hear voices, openly and confidently raised within the PSF, that denigrate us and our communities, that dismiss our experiences, that doubt our values, and harm us materially. Our confidence in the PSF, and the confidence of many other people in our communities, has been shaken. Our motivation has taken some hammer blows. The work of the last decade risks being set back. Constructive collaboration We want to work with the PSF on everything addressed in this letter, in the spirit of constructive collaboration. We are willing to put our energies into building better practices and understanding. We want to be part of a solution to the concerns. We ask the PSF to recognise our concerns, and not just to take them seriously, but to commit to working with the African Python community to address them, so that we do it together.

I am not involved at all with the PSF, but my company has given the PSF money in the past.I think that I could sense the slight uncertainty about the conference, and the post above had made plain why. Considering what more could have been done if that uncertainty was resolved more quickly, the PSF’s procrastination (which is a generous interpretation, a less generous interpretation could be “tactical stonewalling”) is very disappointing.I generally supports PSF initiatives, I hope they will answer publicly and if necessary make commitments to improve their communications and processes. The PSF need to recognise the pent-up demand for support and financial aid outside of the Anglosphere. With good leadership they could make a huge contribution.I appreciate the difficult situation that the organisers are now in: it takes courage to call out poor behaviour.This doesn’t diminish the organisers or the event in any way: it was a huge success from my perspective as an attendee. DjangoCon Africa was the most invigorating conference experience I have had in years. reply jzb 20 hours agoparentWhat strikes me most about this is that, apparently by the timeline described in the open letter, the conference organizers planned the event with the expectation they&#x27;d get funding and asked for the funding fewer than five months before the event. That seems like extremely poor planning from my perspective.Maybe that&#x27;s normal for events given money by PSF, I dunno, but \"we&#x27;ve already decided to do this so hurry up and say yes now or it&#x27;s your fault\" doesn&#x27;t seem entirely reasonable to me. It is, unfortunately, something I&#x27;ve run into time and again, with community driven events. reply sampo 19 hours agorootparent> asked for the funding fewer than five months before the eventThe Python Software Foundation says that they need less than 6 weeks for processing grant applications:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;psf&#x2F;grants&#x2F; reply jzb 19 hours agorootparentYeah, just dug that up myself. I still feel that you ask for funding and then plan the event, if the funding is crucial, but clearly the PSF set an expectation that it didn&#x27;t live up to.Note the same FAQ, though, says this: \"There is no set maximum, but grants are awarded with consideration for the annual PSF grant budget and that events&#x2F;sprints will be virtual...with that in mind are willing to consider up to $2,500 per request for larger virtual events.\"My guess is that this FAQ needs an update now that the PSF is once again willing to fund in-person events. reply ealexhudson 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a bit chicken and egg though: I would expect that a grant would be much more likely to be granted for an event that had a decent amount of groundwork already done? For new events especially, you&#x27;d want to see some commitment. reply jzb 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d want to see a plan, for sure. I would, in the place of the PSF folks, not want to be handed a \"this is already in motion, and we are depending on funding so you better say yes.\" reply remram 10 hours agorootparentThis doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case, and they had a plan if the PSF had said no. The problem is that they didn&#x27;t say anything, which in turn meant they couldn&#x27;t finalize the program or answer to their own requests for travel expense (either way). reply washadjeffmad 18 hours agorootparentprevIn case you&#x27;ve never organized events before, it&#x27;s a bit of a catch-22. You need to be prepared to accomplish what your funding request entails before you are awarded, to the degree of satisfaction of the grantor.When the criteria and timelines are unclear, as they were here, the requestor is put in a position where budgeting becomes a more serious jeopardy to an event than any planning concern.The PSF should have responded. There&#x27;s really no cause for what they did, even if it was only miscommunication. reply jzb 17 hours agorootparentI’ve organized a lot of events, and I’ve been in the position of holding funding for community events. I’ve never put an event in motion with uncertain funding like this, ever. If I can’t do it without funding from a single entity and they may say “no” then I don’t set things in motion until they’ve said yes. reply remram 8 hours agorootparentprevThe letter says it was approved \"nearly three months\" after, and that&#x27;s including the request for more information (idk if that should count as \"processing\" delay or not).Definitely over 6 weeks but not as much as I first assumed. reply pradn 19 hours agorootparentprevI don’t see why it would take more than one PSF board meeting to approve funding for an event. Even if the board had questions, the follow-up is supposed to happen quickly. Several months to approve $9000 is silly. That’s probably just the catering budget for a 3-day, 200-person conference in the Bay Area - let alone for a conference for all of Africa’s Python community. reply jzb 19 hours agorootparentThe FAQ[1] asks for 6 weeks before an event, so I suppose that&#x27;s fair. That still seems like poor planning, though -- clearly the event was planned the the presumption that the funding would be approved. What would this open letter have looked like if the ask had been turned down altogether?IMO the order of operations should be 1) ask for funding, 2) plan the event, not the other way around.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;psf&#x2F;grants&#x2F;faq&#x2F; reply ExoticPearTree 18 hours agorootparentPoor planning to ask for money 6 months in advance? How is that poor planning? reply bombcar 18 hours agorootparentYou ask for money far in advance so you can get a no with a reasonable timeframe to switch to something else.Yes is easy, what&#x27;s you&#x27;re no plan? reply ExoticPearTree 16 hours agorootparent6 months is way in advance. PSF policy is to ask 4-6 weeks before the event (Timeframe: We require that applications be submitted 6 weeks before the event&#x2F;project start date - this gives us enough time to thoroughly review, ask questions, and have enough time to send you the funds.), so 6 months is more than enough time.And we&#x27;re missing the issue: the organizers were asking for $9k, which by all means should have been an easy yes&#x2F;no. If they would have asked for 100k, maybe, but $9k is chump change. reply jzb 15 hours agorootparentThe funding FAQ gives general guidance of $2500 at the high end and still discusses virtual events. I suspect some of the problem is the process is for very low budget meetups, and virtual things, not six-day real world events. reply kakwa_ 16 hours agorootparentprevOr you simply are extremely cautious not knowing how bureaucratic and slow the PSF is or is not. replyExoticPearTree 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m missing something: you&#x27;re saying 5 months in not enough time for a bunch of people to meet up and say \"yeah, we&#x27;re giving money for this event\" or \"no, we&#x27;re not interested\" ? It should be a week or two to decide, not months. reply mkoubaa 18 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m very disappointed in the PSF leadership. Their organization has a clear mission, and it&#x27;s leaders need to be held accountable. Folks leading institutions ought to understand that they are placed there as stewards, not as an opportunity to exercise leverage in other areas, regardless of their good intention. People who donate to PSF do not want to be an instrument for another cause, they could just as well donate to that cause. reply ayhanfuat 22 hours agoprev> What counts as “safety”? Which places in the world are truly safe for LGBTQIA+ community? How much of a city, or state, or country needs to be LGBTQIA+ hostile for the whole of it to be declared unworthy of PSF support?What a cheap shot. You don&#x27;t need a safetyometer or something to determine that a country where same sex relationship is punishable by life imprisonment is unsafe for homosexuals or bisexuals. reply keraf 21 hours agoparentThe claims of Zanzibar being unsafe for LGBTQIA+ communities is ridiculous. I live there and it&#x27;s the most tolerant place I lived in so far. There are laws, but as long as you mind your own business and don&#x27;t disturb others, you will be left alone. I&#x27;ve even been to same-sex weddings here (between foreigners of course, same-sex relationships are still taboo between locals but they do exist) and have gay friends living on the island that never reported any incident (unlike in Europe).Still, there are some things that should be avoided in public, out of respect for the local population. Kissing and holding hands for example is not well seen, even for heterosexual couples. Despite this, even if you happen to do it in public you will never face verbal or physical aggression from anyone, maybe just some frowns but even that is rare.Pushing our views to countries that are still developing is Neocolonialism at its best. We take our progress in the West for granted, but it took us time to get there. Give the tools for Africans country to develop on their own, they will get there in their own time, there are many other pressing matters to address first. reply rob74 21 hours agorootparent> There are laws, but as long as you mind your own business and don&#x27;t disturb others, you will be left alone.that&#x27;s exactly what differentiates developed from developing countries: the rule of law. Not saying that it&#x27;s perfect in developed countries (far from it), but at least you don&#x27;t have to fear being arrested and face life imprisonment for something that&#x27;s \"generally tolerated\", but in your special case wasn&#x27;t because the police officer didn&#x27;t like how you looked, or you didn&#x27;t pay the customary bribe. reply biorach 20 hours agorootparentThe distinction between developed and developing countries you think is so clearcut is actually not so clear\"the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of sodomy laws in Bowers v.

Even if as a foreigner things are \"safe in practice\", that&#x27;s not a guaranteed evaluation if the law still criminalizes it. Just because the people you know are safe doesn&#x27;t protect a possible convention goer who gets a bad run in with the local police and that can result in very bad consequences (prison time) just because they wanted to attend a convention (and raises questions on why a grant for the convention was approved to begin with, given safety is a relevant factor for these).Taking a quick glance at the Wikipedia page about LGBTQ rights in Africa[0] (going for the broad continent page here to see if there are other, less likely to cause problems, candidates for hosting locations), Tanzania is explicitly listed as \"Punishable by prison\" on the map, which the article text confirms. More broadly speaking, it would seem most of the countries in Africa have a poor track record on LGBTQ rights except for South Africa (although I&#x27;d not be surprised if any of the countries listed in grey on the map would&#x27;ve caused less problems with the grant approval, with \"no laws either way\" not being amazing but at least not inherently discriminatory). This begs the rather obvious question: why not organize in South Africa (or again, any of the more lenient countries), why does it have to be in Tanzania once these issues were brought to light.The PSF clearly has standards they wanted to adhere to for these things and wanting a guaranteed safe space for contributors of all walks of life seems to be an important one. I understand the complications on this one and why the usual process resulted in it being kicked upstairs.Which yes, does suck for the organizers, but again, Tanzania was chosen here and they even admit in the post that preliminary feedback caused a negative response surrounding event safety, so moving the event ought to have been considered with that in mind.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LGBT_rights_in_Africa reply isodev 21 hours agorootparentprev> Still, there are some things that should be avoided in publicNow read this again and imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who needs to suppress who they are in public, just so they don’t get stoned to death or make local narrow minded folk get a headache. reply keraf 20 hours agorootparent> out of respect for the local population.You&#x27;re a guest, there are some cultural do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s and holding hands in public is one of the latter, even for heterosexual couples.

How about if a country has a big pro-Israel or anti-Israel protest that the PSF doesn&#x27;t like -- is that a legitimate reason to deny funds for events in that country?An event like DjangoCon in Tanzania is most likely going to be a tiny step forward for LGBT rights there. The organizers are probably more liberal than the average Tanzanian.

I don&#x27;t see a plausible story for how this DjangoCon could be a step back for LGBT rights.If I was a leader of the PSF, my approach would be to not worry about this issue by default. If I heard a story through the grapevine about LGBT Pythonistas feeling unwelcome at the conference, I would have a friendly conversation with the organizers to see if there&#x27;s anything which can be done.

Even if we assume that software should be apolitical, there&#x27;s still the issue that it is the Tanzanian government that is imposing political restrictions on participation. The entire debate here is about the fact that the government of Tanzania will not not allow a software conference to exist in Tanzania that is divorced from politics.If you truly, really want to be apolitical, then it shouldn&#x27;t matter whether an attendee is openly gay or not. If it&#x27;s really separated from the politics, then gay or anti-gay, trans or anti-trans, they should at the very least be able to participate while feeling like they&#x27;re physically safe. And if they&#x27;re not safe, then it&#x27;s not apolitical.If someone feels unsafe participating because of their identity, that is a political conference, it is a conference where people are being excluded on account of someone else&#x27;s political views.The PSF is not asking for everyone in Tanzania to say that they&#x27;re fine with LGBTQ rights. But regardless of someone&#x27;s political views about LGBTQ rights, LGBTQ people should still be able to participate safely in the conference. We&#x27;re not talking about whether people can take part in a software conference while holding anti-LGBTQ views. We&#x27;re asking whether or not it&#x27;s reasonable for the political environment to threaten LGBTQ people and through that threatening environment prevent them from participating.An apolitical conference is one where it&#x27;s safe to give a tech talk regardless of whether or not you&#x27;re openly trans, because regardless of whether or not people are offended about your gender, ultimately the technical content of your talk is the part that matters. A political conference is one where in addition to the tech, you also have to think about how you look and what clues you&#x27;re letting slip and whether or not you&#x27;re doing a good enough job pretending that your partner isn&#x27;t your partner and whether you&#x27;re using the bathroom people expect -- all just so you can avoid legal consequences from the government. reply OkayPhysicist 9 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s \"holds different political views\" and then there&#x27;s \"believe you and your kind should be exterminated\".Whether or not LGBTQ+ people should be arrested and potentially executed is not at all comparable to holding disagreements about tax policy, or whether bridges should be funded over tunnels.

So it is not LGTBQ people who are injecting politics into Python when they point out that they can be imprisoned for their identity, that they can&#x27;t go to a Python conference and just focus on the tech. It is not them who are abandoning the notion of \"live and let live together.\"If this was a conversation about avoiding Tanzania just because some of the attendees might be anti-gay, sure, maybe we could talk about pluralism and decorum. But that&#x27;s not at all the conversation. You want to take politics out of the equation, politics is the thing that throws people in prison for an aspect of their identity that they don&#x27;t even control. Politics is the thing that decides that people going to a tech conference need to be on their best behavior to avoid being prosecuted by the government.Taking politics out of Python and embracing pluralism means saying, \"if somebody wants to give a technical talk in drag then you don&#x27;t get to complain about it as long as the tech talk is good.\" You can dislike it, you can have a political disagreement about it, but a global, officially sanctioned Python conference should be open to everyone. Of course it&#x27;s not the fault of the organizers that their government won&#x27;t allow them to put on a conference that meets that criteria. But it&#x27;s also not the fault of the Python Software Foundation, they don&#x27;t have any special input into Tanzania&#x27;s laws.And while it&#x27;s definitely important to try and be as inclusive as possible to global contributors and to recognize that they are not their government, ultimately if you want to have an apolitical inclusive conference for people from all walks of life, the Tanzania government will not allow you to do that. The Tanzania government (not the African organizers and not the PSF) is saying that the political will rule the technical and the Tanzania government is saying that a politically pluralistic conference is not allowed in Tanzania. The Python Software Foundation is simply recognizing that fact.Of course, if the Tanzania government wants to allow for a pluralistic apolitical tech conference, it could at the very least pass explicit legal guarantees for attendees that they will be at no risk for their orientation or gender identity. But I suspect it&#x27;s not willing to do that for a tech conference, and I suspect (however good their intentions are) that the organizers do not have the political sway necessary to get that kind of concession from the government. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 11 hours agorootparent>But somehow it&#x27;s the people pointing out that the environment isn&#x27;t safe who are getting accused of being against pluralism?Pointing out that it&#x27;s unsafe is one thing, denying funding is another>Taking politics out of Python should mean that whoever you are and whatever you believe and whatever your identity is, you are at least safe at a Python conference because Python conferences are not the places where we debate identity, they&#x27;re places where we talk about Python.I agree.

Seems like you may be working very hard to save people who didn&#x27;t ask to be saved?In any case, in line with my \"give and take\" point from earlier, I think a reasonable conference policy would be as follows: Don&#x27;t worry about this problem until an LGBT African person makes a complaint about it. At that point, talk to the organizers about whether the next conference could be organized in one of the few LGBT-friendly African countries, for the sake of LGBT Pythoneers in Africa.

For example, if a venue change means that some LGBTs can now attend safely, but a much larger number of other conference attendees aren&#x27;t able to reach the new location, then I think it is reasonable to stay in the original location, in order to maximize overall accessibility for attendees. Even if Tanzania is the wrong venue, I think that is a discussion for next year&#x27;s conference -- this isn&#x27;t a sufficient justification to cancel the conference altogether or deny it funding.

Just don&#x27;t say that you want it to be apolitical or pluralistic then. You can not be simultaneously arguing for pluralism and for people to be invisible. Invisibility is not pluralism.> just because it happens to be disproportionately common among the LGBT population?That being said, I would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t mention that wearing drag is not inherently sexual. And before you get too caught up on drag, we should also acknowledge that of course a trans person not wearing drag but merely wearing appropriate clothing for their gender is obviously not sexual or kink. And to be clear, when you ask attendees to keep their identity under the radar, you are asking for transgender people to misgender themselves, you are denying them agency to wear clothing that would be perfectly acceptable for other people to wear at a conference, and you are denying them that agency based entirely on a political designation of their identity.Funding was not denied for this conference because they weren&#x27;t going to allow kink. Funding was denied because the government has threatened to imprison LGBTQ people, and in the defense of \"pluralism\" you are asking LGBTQ attendees to refrain from behaviors and actions that would not raise a single eyebrow from anyone if performed by someone of another gender. You are asking for invisibility and pretending that it&#x27;s pluralism.> Sorry this seems like a total non sequiter to me, you&#x27;ll have to explain better.It is not a reasonable cultural compromise to throw someone into prison, and laws that explicitly rule that people can be thrown into prison are the reason why funding was originally denied.I&#x27;m not sure... how to say that more clearly. It doesn&#x27;t strictly relate to drag in except that drag is yet another thing you could be thrown into prison for. But if you&#x27;re under the assumption that funding was denied over drag, it wasn&#x27;t. It was denied over tangible laws and government policy. Accommodation of that policy is not \"give and take\" and it is completely unreasonable to ask LGBTQ people to tolerate that situation.> I&#x27;m glad you also believe in give and take. Can you give a specific example of a \"give\" that the LGBT community should be willing to make? See my statement from earlier \"Seems like you want LGBT people to do all of the taking and none of the giving.\" I&#x27;m happy to be corrected!Sure. Suppose we held a conference where people were allowed to attend that were gay, and also people were allowed to attend that were anti-gay. A conference organizer might decide, \"yes, we have a position on this, but we&#x27;re going to tolerate someone who is known to be anti-gay attending, provided no one is making anyone else feel unsafe.\"That would be an example of give and take; two communities of people with disagreements temporarily deciding not to be at each others throats or temporarily deciding to tolerate someone&#x27;s involvement even though they find them detestable. It doesn&#x27;t require an anti-gay person to stop denying the existence of LGBTQ identity, and it doesn&#x27;t require LGBTQ people to believe that the anti-gay person is any less of a bigot. But... we live in a pluralistic society and in the interest of keeping that society running we have collectively all agreed that we are going to do our absolute best not to kill each other.In contrast, suppose we held a conference where people were allowed to attend that were gay, and then some other people said, \"what the heck, no, I&#x27;d better not even be aware that there are gay people here, if I catch them they are going to be in physical danger.\" That is an example of one side doing \"all the taking.\" The Tanzania government&#x27;s position is not compromise. It gives nothing, it is a physical threat.> Maybe there&#x27;s a misunderstanding here. I agree that the Tanzanian government are being jerks.

But it wasn&#x27;t a local event and it&#x27;s not an exclusion from the community. I just don&#x27;t think your characterization here is accurate, this was planned to be an international event, the linked open letter describes it that way.

(\"God told me to speak my truth, you&#x27;re going to send me to hell!\")Can you see why people might choose to agree on a norm of more subtle identity expression for a professional conference? And how a Christian who is asked to remove an \"I Trust Leviticus\" shirt would be acting like a diva if that Christian complained that you were \"forcing him to be invisible\"? Or if that same Christian says that gay people are oppressing him with their subtle rainbow jewelry because gay sex is gross and disgusting and causes him to involuntarily vomit, activating his gut condition?Or are we going to define identity expression such that when gays do it, that&#x27;s just an irrepressible part of their identity, but when Christians do it, they are oppressing others? It seems to me like you&#x27;re pretty biased in terms of making these judgements, but for pluralism they need to be made in an unbiased way.I guess what I&#x27;m trying to get at here is just, don&#x27;t be a diva, and try to see things from the perspective of others.

When someone makes a point about conferences in places with terrible human rights and you miss the point completely to talk about something unrelated, it is not normal conversation. reply HelloNurse 2 minutes agorootparentThis is the sort of delicate topic that tends to exceed the boundaries of normal hypocrisy, with tangents that are irrational and self-delusional (like the abundance of slightly blunted, sometimes subconscious hate speech), rhetorically illogical and distracting (slavery, precedents of other conferences in other places, etc.), drastically missing the point (e.g. the distinctions between Tanzanian laws and what happens to foreign tourists in Zanzibar).andrepd 22 hours agoparentprevIf you read the whole context, that is not the point at all. The point is (1) that the Python event would be an effective safe space even in a context of LGBT persecution, and (2) that it&#x27;s illegitimate and counterproductive to prevent such an event from happening just because it&#x27;s located in a less than enlightened country. Both of those are valid. reply ayhanfuat 22 hours agorootparentWhat is an effective safe space other than saying \"relax, generally nothing happens\"? Are you guaranteeing their safety? Of course not. I live in a \"less than enlightened\" country and I do know when everything feels safe tiny little things can lead to catastrophic consequences. I experience it regularly.

There are even Roman Catholic monasteries&#x2F;convents in the country that do philanthropic work with rural communities, on the condition that they don’t try to openly convert locals, and of course they all possess Bibles and liturgical books for their services.This is something that even tourists are often aware of, because in Tangier the Anglican parish[1] is a popular tourist attraction.

Why are you so fixated on that? reply disgruntledphd2 21 hours agorootparentSure, that&#x27;s totally fine.However, what is the impact here?Basically the volunteers for a Python conference needed to write an open letter as the conference didn&#x27;t happen.Like, if the PSF don&#x27;t want conferences in places where same-sex relationships are prohibited, then they should just make that a policy. Personally, I would disagree with that policy as I don&#x27;t see how Python relates to said policies, but it would be fine.What&#x27;s not fine is relatively poor volunteers being forced to guarantee major expenses for a conference because the PSF couldn&#x27;t make a decision. reply DeathArrow 21 hours agorootparentprev>PSF has some moral viewsI thought the reason PSF exists is to promote Python, not to have political views. reply Xeamek 21 hours agorootparentThe main reason of some entity&#x27;s existence doesn&#x27;t prevent it from having an additional views, that can even shape the way they execute their primary goal reply Tao3300 18 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.python.org&#x2F;psf&#x2F;mission&#x2F;> The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers. reply polski-g 18 hours agorootparentBy prohibiting African Python programmers from taking part because of their political views, how does that promote \"diverse and international communities\"?Are anti-LGBT Africans not diverse enough? reply acdha 17 hours agorootparentNobody is prohibited from attending based on their political views.

If you see freedom as additive, that’s consistent: the PSF doesn’t want to be associated with conferences which are risky for some people to attend. That doesn’t mean that a different conference can’t be organized, only that they are uncomfortable supporting less free places.

Tanzania != Malaysia, as another commenter seemed to think. Their version of Sharia is nowhere near as strict.Incidents of violence are the product of opportunity and generally perpetrated through in-group policing. Westerners and other African travellers are less exposed, so in the case of an LGBT developer from the US travelling to Zanzibar (which is also a very special case relative to the rest of Tanzania) I doubt they&#x27;d be in any real danger unless they were publicly displaying unambiguous attraction to the same-sex. I know an openly gay couple living in Kinshasa, which is a much more dangerous environment.This is a very cheap shot from PSF and a classic case of perfect defeating good. reply Tao3300 18 hours agorootparentHeh... if the argument is coming down to \"yeah, but in their version of Sharia\", I&#x27;m thinking maybe it&#x27;s not such a good idea. reply phantomathkg 22 hours agorootparentprevNot answering for African or Python community standpoint, but surely in Muslim country there are people monitoring.

I have traveled the Muslim world and sub-Saharan Africa extensively and I have met plenty of fellow travelers who are gay, whether individuals or even gay couples. The couples simply don’t show affection in public, but heterosexual couples shouldn’t either. Even sharing a room as two men or two women is no issue, because the locals will assume you are friends unless you explicitly, deliberately, tell them otherwise.And twice when I got the contact info of local Europeans living in the region who were known for extending hospitality to any travelers coming through, I arrived to find that it was a gay couple who had been there for decades. I must say, this whole thread is full of uninformed stereotypes, and posters would benefit from firsthand experience of the world. reply plufz 9 hours agorootparent> I must say, this whole thread is full of uninformed stereotypes, and posters would benefit from firsthand experience of the world.LBTQ and HR activists often protest international conferences and events held in countries with lacking human rights.

People in those areas should be able to hold their own conferences, and should get questions on funding answered in a timely manner. The point I wanted to make was that there are valid reasons to not hold (or fund) a conference based on local laws. reply em-bee 19 hours agorootparentright, but those reasons could have been considered when the permission to host an event called pycon was sought and given.i&#x27;d like to assume that once i have permission to organize a pycon, then funding is a mere question of how much, and whether the expenses are appropriate, not whether it should be funded at all. reply jdiff 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t disagree.

And I live in a country where such laws targeting LGBTQ has been enacted. FYI, Most people here have no idea what LGBTQ means and those who do don&#x27;t give a damn. Those leading the making of laws and noise making are just populists after their bread. [These are facts, hoping they still matter]If you feel so strong about attending the conference, no one is going to ask your sexual orientation at the airport. Tourists are coming in everyday.

Zanzibar seems like one of the few places that would work, along with Botswana, and a few others. Some of the other countries that might work have completely different safety issue, regardless of your sexual orientation.I think realistically, someone has the well meant opinion that these conferences should only be held in places where everyone can feel completely safe, and then just completely ignores reality. The unfortunate result is an effectual ban on any meetings in places like Africa or the Middle East, which is equally unreasonable and excluding.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;LGBT_rights_by_country_or_terr... reply nomdep 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think is unreasonable at all.

Python evangelism is about the tech and is not an endorsement of whoever organize conferences, even if is in nazi Germany.2. Giving money to a conference IS an endorsement of whoever organize it, so it must comply with the morals of the PSF board and biggest backers.In hindsight, (1) seems more fair, but because the PSF is about politics and not tech, is not surprising they will always choose (2). reply IAmLiterallyAB 19 hours agorootparentprevBased on that map, South Africa would seem to be the best choice reply doix 19 hours agorootparentSouth Africa is great except they have rolling blackouts(load shedding) and can be somewhat unsafe.

Quad9 has received word from the courts in Dresden, Germany in the appeal of our case versus Sony Entertainment (Germany). The court has ruled in favor of Quad9, clearly and unequivocally. The text from the court is available here in German and in English. Needless to say, we are elated at the news. Background Sony Entertainment (Germany) started a legal proceeding against Quad9 more than two years ago to force Quad9 to stop resolving certain domain names which they claimed were involved in copyright infringement behavior. 07/2023 03/2023 02/2023 08/2022 09/2021 We believe this lawsuit was an attempt to set a precedent, such that commercial rights holders could demand that sites on the internet be made unreachable by forcing recursive resolvers to block content. We contended that recursive resolvers have no commercial or even remotely indirect relationship to any of the infringing parties, and that Sony’s demand for blocking was ineffective, inappropriately specified, and not related to Quad9. What made this case more problematic, in our view, was that the servers in question in this case were not located in Germany, and the links they pointed to were on servers also not in Germany. The domain name (canna.to) was not registered in Germany and was under the top-level-domain operated by the nation of Tonga. Sony Entertainment further asserted that we block the domains globally, not just in Germany, as geoIP does not block for users based in Germany with certainty. For that matter, Quad9 has no office or standing in Germany (we are a Swiss entity), but due to the Lugano Convention treaty it was possible for Sony to serve an injunction in Switzerland and drag Quad9 into legal proceedings. Details on Judgement The appeal with the Higher Regional Court in Dresden follows a decision by the Regional Court in Leipzig, in which Sony prevailed, and Quad9 was convicted as a wrongdoer. Before that, Sony successfully obtained a preliminary junction against Quad9 with the Regional Court in Hamburg. The objection against the preliminary injunction by Quad9 was unsuccessful, and the appeal with the Higher Regional Court in Hamburg was withdrawn by Quad9 since a decision in the main proceeding was expected to be made earlier than the conclusion of the appeal in the preliminary proceedings. Please find below a table summarizing the main take-aways from the decision in Dresden. For more information on these points, please go here. Leipzig Dresden Result Extending the motion to “and/or the other domain(s) is ok “and/or the other domain(s)” is too unspecific Win DNS resolver plays a \"central role\" in the publication of the copyrighted material leading to liability as a wrongdoer No liability as a perpetrator: DNS resolver does not play a “central role” Win No Störerhaftung as Quad9 was held liable as a wrongdoer No Störerhaftung Win Liability privileges are not applicable as DNS resolver operators are not deemed service providers under the Telemedia Services Act DNS resolver operators enjoy liability privileges as access providers Win Subsidiarity criteria fulfilled Subsidiarity criteria not fulfilled: Sony has not done enough to go after the hosting company Win The court has also ruled that the case cannot be taken to a higher court and their decision is the final word in this particular case. Sony may appeal the appeal closure via a complaint against the denial of leave of appeal and then would have to appeal the case itself with the German Federal Court. So while there is still a possibility that this case could continue, Sony would have to win twice to turn the decision around again. We would also like to clarify that even though Quad9 benefits from the liability privileges as a mere conduit, it is possible that a DNS resolver operator can be required to block as a matter of last resort if the claiming party has taken appropriate means to go after the wrongdoer and the hosting company unsuccessfully. Such measures could be legal action by applying for a preliminary injunction against a hosting company within the EU. These uncertainties still linger, and we expect that this ongoing question of what circumstances require what actions, by what parties, will continue to be argued in court and in policy circles over the next few years. We remain committed to the concept that resolving a domain name is not an action that should be prohibited for commercial goals. The DNS does not contain content - it is a system designed for delivery only of pointers, not for data transport. The courts in Cologne also recently ruled in favor of Cloudflare in a similar case involving DNS recursive resolution (though that case also includes a separate consideration of issues relating to CDN and proxying services.) and we are pleased to have consistent and clear statements from both courts in this matter of DNS recursive resolution. Today was a significant win in Germany, but there is some disappointment as well. We received a notice from a consortium of Italian rightsholders (Sony Music Italy, Universal Music Italy, Warner Music Italy, and Federation of Italian Music Industry) who have demanded that Quad9 block domains in Italy, and there is potentially another court process ahead of us. We have a blog post on that here, also published today. Actions taken From a practical perspective, Quad9 has removed the blocks on all domains previously noted by Sony and documented in the lower courts. Those domains are listed below. Currently, there are no domains now being blocked in Germany or anywhere else related to this case. Thanks to those who believed in us and in your rights There are hundreds of individual supporters that we wish to thank for their monetary support, advice, and willingness to speak up in public - social media, blogs, and in industry settings. In particular, we would like to thank our legal team at Rickert.law - Thomas Rickert and Sandra Schulte - who gave us an enormously generous amount of effort and time spent on achieving this win. We'd also like to thank the GFF for their legal advice, continued advisement on German media issues, and for being a sounding board for our legal team and management. We would also like to thank the Kahle Austin Family Foundation, and Stiftung Mercator Schweiz, and eco for their support. To those who have donated to Quad9: By helping us, you helped yourself. It is clear to us that expansionism of internet censorship will never stop and letting minor inappropriate removals of digital sovereignty go without challenge will ultimately end with heavy-handed suppression of ideas much closer to the user. Those boundaries are constantly being tested, and we have won this round. You have kept the front lines from moving closer to you - congratulations! Quad9 is a non-profit organization, and the costs of pursuing court cases is a heavy burden which takes away our ability to expand the network as quickly as we need. We will continue to need that help in the next phases of our defense of the DNS. Please consider donating - every euro counts as we continue to fight for your ability to use the DNS. Thank you for making this possible for us. Regardless of our victory in this case, the costs to Quad9 have been extensive and excessive from a real monetary perspective as well as a time and attention drain. If you feel like we have done service for you in this court case, please consider donating to Quad9 so that we can catch up to where we should have been by now with other costs related to our continued service.

I will also point out that Germany is the reason why the US went to life+70 terms in the 90s, since they had the longest terms in the EU. Disney was able to play the EU off the US to get an extra few decades on Mickey Mouse. However, that seems only scarcely related to this lawsuit. Even if copyright terms were only a few years, we&#x27;d still have idiot companies trying to take down notorious markets through any intermediary they can yell at.

This is likely in order to protect the higher instances from being flooded with appeals on non-fundamental issues. As mentioned by TFA, there is still a procedure to object to such a decision, but it comes with higher hurdles for providing justification for objecting. reply slow_typist 11 hours agorootparentThe procedure is called Nichtzulassungsbeschwerde in Germany, and is generally possible if the claim exceeds 20,000 EUR according to § 544 ZPO [1]. At the BGH (highest civil court), the success rate is surprisingly high, less than 5% rejections in 2022 [2].

Yes, they don&#x27;t have to know how to program a PDF redaction tool, but they should certainly be proficient in using one.

Human comprehension is a shallow collection of approximations and simplifications - albeit in different areas for different people, but the point is that no one mind is capable of understanding everything anymore.

    "originLink": "https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2023/12/05/introducing-wikifunctions-first-wikimedia-project-to-launch-in-a-decade-creates-new-forms-of-knowledge/",
    "originBody": "A “function” is a sequence of programming instructions that makes a calculation based on data provided. Internet users most commonly encounter functions when entering queries on search engines, such as the time difference between two cities, the distance between two locations, or the volume of an object. Functions operate behind-the-scenes to produce answers to these queries. For the first time, Wikifunctions will provide a library of functions that everyone, everywhere can access and contribute to. Notably, these functions can exist in any language; therefore, for many Wikifunctions users, this will be the first project where they can read and write functions in their native language. “Functions are pathways to knowledge. Wikifunctions aims to make these pathways more accessible than ever before. Imagine a programming system where a single line of code can be run from anywhere by anyone — even by programs written in different programming languages. That is the promise and potential of Wikifunctions,” said Dr. Denny Vrandečić, Head of Special Projects at the Wikimedia Foundation. “Wikifunctions will be built in the same community-led fashion as Wikipedia, with volunteer editors donating their time and energy to the cause of building a freely editable library of valuable functions. We are excited for this project to continue to grow with their contributions.” Currently, functions on Wikimedia projects are complex, siloed, and vary by language versions of various projects (Wikipedia alone has over 300 language versions). Wikifunctions will place functions in a single shared space, simplifying the work of the volunteers who maintain them and increasing their accessibility. Wikifunctions will eventually integrate with Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, opening new opportunities for knowledge creation. “Wikifunctions will bring together different data sources from other Wikimedia projects in new and powerful ways, ultimately leveraging functional code to create new forms of knowledge,” said Selena Deckelmann, Chief Product and Technology Officer at the Wikimedia Foundation. “We are excited to announce Wikifunctions as yet another step in getting us closer to our vision of a world where everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.” Wikifunctions is the underlying technical infrastructure that will support a wider initiative by the Wikimedia Foundation to enable people to share more knowledge in more languages across Wikipedia. Through this initiative, users will be able to create and maintain content in their native language, which others can access in over 300 languages available on Wikimedia projects. The long-term aim of this effort is to create knowledge that is independent of language, and easier for Wikipedia editors to share, add, translate, and improve across languages on the online encyclopedia. The work is being supported by grants from Google.org, The Rockefeller Foundation, and the Wikimedia Endowment. Wikifunctions was approved by the Wikimedia Foundation’s Board of Trustees in 2020. The project went live as a read-only site earlier this year, and it is now available so that anyone, anywhere can use it. It is the fourteenth Wikimedia project — the first new project in a decade. Learn more about the project at wikifunctions.org. About the Wikimedia Foundation The Wikimedia Foundation is the nonprofit organization that operates Wikipedia and other Wikimedia free knowledge projects. Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We believe that everyone has the potential to contribute something to our shared knowledge and that everyone should be able to access that knowledge freely. We host Wikipedia and the Wikimedia projects; build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content; support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible.

The traditional answer to this kind of critique would be to say, “Let’s just organize an effort to work on Grammatical Framework.” The design philosophy behind Abstract Wikipedia is to make as few assumptions about a contributor’s facility with English and programming experience as possible. Organized efforts around Grammatical Framework (or otherwise) are not a bad idea at all. They may well solve some problems for some languages. However, the contributor pools for under-resourced languages are already small. Demanding expertise with specific natural languages like English and also specific programming paradigms contracts those pools still further.and> A solution designed by a small group of Westerners is likely to produce a system that replicates the trends of an imperialist English-focused Western-thinking industry. Existing tools tell a one-voice story; they are built by the same people (in a socio-cultural sense) and produce the same outcome, which is crafted to the needs of their creators (or by the limits of their understanding).

In this situation, if you said \"I have an empty meat pot\" and somebody answered you \"No, I need an empty milk pot, give me another one!\" - it would make a total sense. Even though both pots are empty, they are not the same kind of pot for their users.Similarly, if a string is a sequence of certain objects (characters, bytes, runes, graphemes, whatever you please) then empty sequence of such objects is not the same as an empty sequence of other objects - you could append a character to it, but you can&#x27;t append a database connection to it, for example, and expect something sane to happen.So yes, \"empty cup of water\" is exactly what it is, because in most programming languages, empty cups are not all alike. In some languages, there are sequence types that are agnostic towards their elements, and then an empty sequence of that kind wouldn&#x27;t be a sequence of anything - it&#x27;d be just a separate entity. But strings rarely are implemented this way, for many practical reasons. reply cfiggers 5 hours agorootparentprevYou just... Blew my mind.So, but wait...

Is this like the number sequences library but for pure functions? reply duskwuff 13 hours agoparentThe description is a little vague and hand-wavey. Here&#x27;s a concrete example:A lot of Wikipedia sites have scripts embedded in the wikitext which automatically generate or transform information on a page, e.g. automatically performing unit conversions to generate text like \"I would walk 500 miles (804.67 km)\", performing date math to automatically generate and update a person&#x27;s age based on their birthdate, or querying structured data from Wikidata [1] to display in an infobox. One example of these scripts is the {{convert}} [2] template on the English Wikipedia.Initially, these scripts were written in MediaWiki template logic [3], and were maintained individually on each wiki. This quickly proved unmaintainable, and some of those scripts were rewritten in Lua using the Scribunto extension [4], but these were still per-wiki, and there were frequently issues where different wikis would copy scripts from each other and introduce their own incompatible features.The WikiFunctions project is an attempt to centralize development of these scripts, much like how Wikimedia Commons [5] centralizes hosting of freely licensed images and other media.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wikidata.org&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Template:Convert[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediawiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Help:Extension:ParserFunction...[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mediawiki.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extension:Scribunto[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;commons.wikimedia.org&#x2F; reply starkparker 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;d be an even better example if there was an equivalent conversion function on Wikifunctions to link to.

We think this is a huge missed opportunity. One of the longest-standing requests from the Wikimedia community has been to provide a means of reusing code across different projects by centralizing common code on a global wiki. This is a tractable, well-scoped problem (at least in comparison with Wikifunctions as currently conceived).> “V1” of Wikifunctions could have been a new, central wiki for common Lua code. Structuring the development plan for Wikifunctions in this way would have meant a much shorter, surer path to delivering value to Wikimedians. It would have satisfied a long-standing community request, and (we suspect) earned the team quite a lot of goodwill. The team could then innovate on top of this initial version by building new graphical interfaces for producing and interacting with code, and by extending the capabilities of querying Wikidata.> We are not sure why this was overlooked, particularly in light of the project requirements described above. In conversations with the Abstract Wikipedia team, team members suggested to us that this option was considered and rejected because Scribunto is an expert system and that Lua is based on English, and that these properties made it incompatible with the Wikifunction goal of broad accessibility. We think this is a bad argument, for the following reasons:> - Lua has been successfully adopted by many projects whose primary language (as in, the language spoken by the users and developers) is not English. It is used successfully in hundreds of different language editions of Wikipedia.> - Wikifunctions can provide localized, graphical user interfaces that generate Lua code behind the scenes (see Blockly, for example). Lua can also be used as a “transpilation” target for text-based programming languages (there is precedent for this on Wikimedia wikis). As an intermediate representation, Lua would be far more efficient and robust than an ad-hoc function composition language.Which are all great points explicitly disregarded by Abstract Wikipedia for Wikifunctions. reply noirscape 11 hours agorootparent> We are not sure why this was overlooked, particularly in light of the project requirements described above.I can guess the actual reason for this and it amounts to \"managerial pride causing NIH\".

What do they mean by &#x27;Python&#x27;?Most programming languages make considerable effort in supporting old versions (gcc has c90 and c++98 for example, fortran goes even earlier). With Java, they make very strong efforts to support older code (as long as it uses the library which are labelled as stable). Old javascript code also tends to work well, as there are lots of old websites that don&#x27;t want breaking.Python on the other hand has gone out of it&#x27;s way to nuke Python 2, and many new version of Python 3 deletes something from the standard library. reply JCharante 6 hours agoparentPython 3 came out 15 years ago.

For reference, the greater project this is a part of has been in development since 2013[0] and seems to be an attempt to basically remove the editor from Wikipedia.For the uninitiated - this is part of an attempt to basically turn WikiData[1] into article text. From what I understand, the idea behind this is to create a bunch of text rendering functions to make it easier to provide automatic translations of rendered text.Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the idea here is neat, but from what I understand the Wikipedia community has been having far greater needs not being met rather than some lofty goal to drive even more editors out of the site and replacing them with data entry drones. It&#x27;s a bit too often that you hear about some ailing extension and the WMF response being \"no budget for it\", while a lot of it gets spend on projects like this.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abstract_Wikipedia[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikidata:Main_Page - basically, Wikipedia data meant to be in a machine-readable format. reply simbolit 7 hours agoparentThe goal of Wikipedia is for every \"person on the planet [to be] given free access to the sum of all human knowledge\".The community is a means to that end, not the end. reply zozbot234 11 hours agoparentprev> Yet another Wikimedia project with way too lofty ambitions...Perhaps, but so what. Wikidata was \"a project with way too lofty ambitions\" back when it started (a.k.a. make the Semantic Web something that actually works in a useful way) and it&#x27;s been wildly successful. It now gets more edits per minute than the most popular Wikipedia and gets used all over the place by Big Tech firms. reply simonw 11 hours agoparentprevWhat are some of those greater needs that are not being met? reply noirscape 11 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s been a hot minute since I last looked at the most recent list, but the short of it is that the WMF likes to release extensions onto Wikipedias that ship with a ton of technical bugs, aren&#x27;t tested beforehand by the Wikipedia community for usability (which is ironic given the WMFs obsession with making tools as accessible as possible) and when the complaints get leveled, the response from the WMF basically ends up being \"yeah so there&#x27;s no budget for that\". Rinse and repeat for a ton of tiny technical issues that affect all their extensions on the regular. It&#x27;s a bit odd to be putting so many engineers and money onto lofty projects when the maintenance of Wikimedia extensions is in such an extremely precarious state already.The most evergreen example of this is and probably always will be the rollout of VisualEditor, their WYSIWG editor. It was completely unwanted, was proven to be not ready for general use (due to all the problems that plague \"combining a WYSIWG editor with a code view\"), yet forcibly deployed on all Wikipedia languages without much room for warning or feedback. After that, the WMF promised communities the option to opt-out if they didn&#x27;t want it... before violating it on the German Wikipedia because they voted to not roll it out. To my knowledge, VisualEditor hasn&#x27;t improved over the years (beyond \"rewrite Parsoid into PHP\"), but editors have just gritted their teeth. That&#x27;s the extreme example, but the WMFs relationship with building features for Wikipedia is... pretty much in a vacuum from what users want. A lot of their projects seem to be conceived by WMF managers first, without consultation to their existing community of volunteers.Which is I guess fine for moonshot projects like Wikifunctions (since they don&#x27;t involve the volunteers before release) but results in a lot of friction when a managers pet project is forcibly rolled out on all language Wikipedias. Very few of their big extension deployments have gone smoothly with the community. I distinctly remember the Minerva skin (mobile Wikipedia) needing tons of changes and improvements before it was usable as well, after it was already rolled out and caused a ton of negative fedback. reply zozbot234 10 hours agorootparentVisualEditor has actually rolled out lots of features since it first came out, and more are in the pipeline that rely on the same infrastructure (particularly around helping novices find things they can help with). You don&#x27;t have to use it if you don&#x27;t like it, but it&#x27;s been huge for helping less technical users become contributors. reply starkparker 8 hours agorootparentBoth can be, and are, true.The Visual Editor works better now for its designed purpose than it did before, and rewriting Parsoid in PHP made it easier to deploy and maintain across projects (and in general Mediawiki). For editing text and non-templated content, which is the bulk of the work and the entry point for new contributors, it&#x27;s matured into a useful tool.The Visual Editor was also designed around English and European Wikipedia usage, and it still causes problems for other Wikipedia languages and for Wikimedia projects outside of Wikipedia. It has strong built-in opinions about the usage and design of skins and templates that other Wikimedia projects disagreed with.And it&#x27;s still frustrating as tech, both in bugs and by design, and especially when used in situations where wikitext editing is still common or required. It has caching and session bugs that either don&#x27;t affect or aren&#x27;t as destructive to other editing tools, or even pre-PHP Parsoid versions of VE. It still makes unnecessary wikitext changes — and arbitrary, if you weren&#x27;t in the discussions where they were implemented or closed out as Won&#x27;t Fix — to formatting and templates based on its own strong opinions. It breaks completely on interwiki redirects, a bigger problem for projects outside of Wikipedia than inside of it.It&#x27;s a useful, arguably invaluable, tool for new contributors that was badly designed at launch, has improved since, but is still fundamentally incompatible with many use cases into which it&#x27;s been forced. reply simonw 11 hours agorootparentprevThanks, that was really informative. reply culi 10 hours agoprevIs it me or does it not seem very well thought out? Every example I&#x27;ve seen only has implementations in JavaScript and&#x2F;or Python (without any mention of which version of this language the code is meant to run in. A critical piece of info for certain languages). I haven&#x27;t seen any other languages nor a way to search by language. What a \"string\" means in one language can be completely different in another language. The primitive data types that the project assumes are not really supported across all programming languages.Also if anyone hasn&#x27;t already seen them, similar projects already exist and are more complete.

Is this a tool for computer scientists to use in mapping the standard functions in various languages, rather than a reference resource for the working coder? The blog post doesn&#x27;t go into any useful details, it&#x27;s more like a standard marketing team announcement. They do mention it&#x27;s part of wider initiative but it&#x27;s not clear what that will be.I do agree though that, especially in the age of AI autocomplete tools, I will never find this useful.... actually, maybe it&#x27;s a great resource for LLMs to learn from? reply jacekm 8 hours agorootparent> Is this a tool for computer scientists to use in mapping the standard functions in various languages, rather than a reference resource for the working coder?Neither of these. The video on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikifunctions.org&#x2F; gives a better explanation. If I understand it correctly, the project seems to be aimed at providing building blocks to more complex functions. Once the basic functions are defined in programming languages and described using natural language, you&#x27;ll then be able to create new functions without writing any code, just by using existing blocks. Because each function is supposed to be described in multiple natural languages, you will be able to utilize them even if you don&#x27;t speak English. Whatever you create you&#x27;ll be able to embed on Wikipedia pages to perform calculations (e.g. automatic unit conversions) or string transformations. reply windwindow 9 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;mas.to&#x2F;@vrandecic&#x2F;110866878265998471> I love Rosetta Code and we took a look at it.

Same for Wikisource and Wikiquote.Wikivoyage is just not well made and there are other better projects out thereWikispecies should just be a result of Wikidata, not a new project. Catalogue of Life (taxonomy) is much more thorough, rigorous, complete, and maintainable. No academic would use Wikispecies over COL. Misguided hobbyists might and that&#x27;s a problem. And Open Tree of Life (phylogeny) already (thoroughly) serves the purpose of centralizing phylogenetic studies so there&#x27;s really no unique thing Wikispecies provides and it gets outcompeted on the things it does provide.Wikifunctions... I&#x27;m gonna be honest. I really think it&#x27;s not well thought out and wish it didn&#x27;t exist. I know a lot of people have already poured in a lot of effort into it and I always hate to shit on that, but as a long time Wikipedian I hate to see Wikimedia&#x27;s name backing this up. Especially when I feel there are already other efforts out there that are more complete, better thought out, and better organized that would benefit from more contributors reply zozbot234 1 hour agorootparentWikibooks and Wikiversity are pretty different. The former is about book-like or tutorial-like content (not just textbooks, but mostly any non-fictional content) that doesn&#x27;t fit in the reference-work format of Wikipedia, whereas the latter is a catchall project for useful education-focused content. Wikisource hosts complete primary sources where allowed by copyright, while Wikiquote focuses on short well-known citations, including from modern works.But yes I&#x27;m pretty sure that Wikispecies would not exist if it was proposed today, Wikidata has basically superseded it. The Wiktionary is a lot more popular but it could also end up being broadly superseded by Wikidata&#x27;s lexical content. reply windwindow 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d argue that sister projects such as Wikidata, Wikiversity, etc, are greatly useful and that the solution to improving them is not to neglect them, but to provide more resources to them. reply starkparker 8 hours agorootparentWikidata was launched by the same people launching Wikifunctions, in service of the same broader goals around abstraction of facts and semantic usage.

    "title": "23andMe Faces Backlash for Requiring Binding Arbitration in TOS Update",
    "originLink": "https://stackdiary.com/23andme-updates-tos-to-force-binding-arbitration/",
    "originBody": "23andMe is updating its TOS to force binding arbitration with a limited opt-out window In response to the cyberattack, rather than implementing robust security measures, 23andMe has opted for a legal shield, mandating binding arbitration for disputes. by alex ivanovs on december 6, 2023 9:53 am Photo: 23andMe 23andMe, the personal genomics and biotechnology company, has been trying to contain a security breach that was first disclosed on October 6th. On October 19th, 23andMe disclosed another security breach by the same hacker who had initially claimed responsibility. The hacker said he had access to more than 4 million genetic profile records this time. And on December 4th, 23andMe confirmed that the total scope of the breach was 6.9 million users in total. The fallout of this disclosure, which started in October, was swift. By October 14th, several individuals had already filed lawsuits against 23andMe for negligence, as Stack Diary reported. Likewise, the general consensus of 23andMe users has been that the company handled the situation very poorly. To add insult to injury, Stack Diary can reveal that 23andMe is now rolling out an update to its Terms of Service. This change will force its users into binding arbitration, which is a means to resolve disputes (such as a cybersecurity breach leaking your DNA data) outside of court. In this process, both parties in a disagreement present their cases to an arbitrator, who is a neutral third party. The arbitrator listens to both sides, reviews the evidence, and decides. The key aspect of binding arbitration is that the arbitrator's decision is final and legally enforceable, meaning both parties must accept it and cannot appeal to a regular court. This method is commonly used in various settings, including consumer contracts, employment disputes, and business disagreements, as it is often faster and less formal than going to court. And 23andMe is trying to accomplish exactly this. Initial Dispute Resolution Period: If you have a problem with 23andMe's services, you first need to contact their customer care team. This is to try and solve the issue quickly and without legal proceedings. You have to try this informal negotiation for at least 60 days before you can take any further legal action. You need to provide them with a detailed email outlining your issue, including what the dispute is about, when it happened, what you want as a solution, and your contact details. You (and your lawyer, if you have one) will also need to have a discussion with them to try and solve the dispute. Arbitration Instead of Court: If the issue isn't resolved in those 60 days, the next step is usually not a lawsuit in court, but arbitration. This means a neutral third party (an arbitrator) will listen to both sides and make a decision. The rules of this process are governed by JAMS, a company that provides arbitration services. In some cases, if many people have similar disputes against 23andMe, a different process called Mass Arbitration with another company, NAM, will be used. Arbitrator's Decision: The arbitrator’s decision is final. They have to follow the law and can give any ruling that a court could. Exceptions to Arbitration: There are a few situations where you or 23andMe can take the issue to court instead of arbitration. This includes things like intellectual property disputes and small claims (minor issues). No Class Actions: You can't join with other people to bring a class action or collective arbitration against 23andMe. Each dispute is handled individually. Severability: If any part of this dispute resolution section is not legally enforceable, the rest still applies. In the event of a cybersecurity breach, this means that if you have a dispute with 23andMe about it, you would first try to resolve it with their customer care. If that doesn't work, you'd generally go to arbitration, not a lawsuit, unless it falls under one of the exceptions. You also can't join a class action lawsuit for such an issue. 23andMe is beginning to notify its users 23andMe is beginning to inform its users of a modification in their Terms of Service via email. Users are given a 30-day window from when they receive this email to opt out of these new, stringent terms that significantly reduce their rights. In the email that 23andMe is sending to its users, the \"notify us\" hyperlink contains an email address that is \"legal@23andme.com\" as opposed to an address that is listed in the Terms of Service. The email doesn't mention that you must email the \"arbitrationoptout@23andme.com\" address to opt out of forced arbitration, as outlined in the updated Terms of Service, which you can preview here. 30 Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at arbitrationoptout@23andme.com. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service, or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing an Arbitration and Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver section otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. It's unlikely that the intention of the email mix-up is malicious in nature; they would absolutely get destroyed by every privacy organization on the planet if they snuck in a change like that, but I have emailed them to verify the above and will add a response here once I get it. That said, unless you email this account 30 days after starting to use the service for the first time, you will automatically be enrolled in this arbitration scheme. Likewise, this affects all users who were affected by the cybersecurity breach since the terms were changed after the fact. Because these terms were put in place on November 30, 2023 - it has already been over a week, and most users might not understand why this is important or relevant. If you're unsure as to why arbitration is bad, it's because it is biased against the consumer. The Stanford Graduate School of Business did an entire study on it; you can read the blog post about it here or view the entire study here. Here's an excerpt from the blog post: Now, a new analysis of almost 9,000 arbitration cases from the securities industry confirms what many have long suspected: The system is biased against consumers — and not just because big companies have more money to spend on lawyers. When it comes to arbitration, the study finds, companies have a big information advantage in fishing for arbitrators who are likely to rule in their favor. Making matters worse, the arbitrators themselves know that being pro-company in one case greatly increases their chances of being picked for future cases. Edmund L. Andrews, Stanford Business This is merely about 23andMe protecting itself (not you, the consumer) because if a security breach of this scope happens again in the future, it will have some protection against mass user complaints. How to opt-out (email template) If you have been affected by the security breach at 23andMe and would like to opt out of the forced arbitration, here is an email template that you can use: To: legal@23andme.com, customercare@23andme.com, arbitrationoptout@23andme.com Subject: Request to Opt-Out of Updated TOS Dear 23andMe Team, I am contacting you regarding the recent changes to the 23andMe Terms of Service, dated November 30, 2023.

For example, disassembling or repairing items you paid for or duplicating legally owned copyrighted works for personal use (not distribution) were rights that were well established, but sprinkle in the right technology (even if it has no purpose other than to interfere with these rights) and suddenly it gets a pass.

    "title": "Unveiling the ESP32: Open-source MAC Layer Development",
    "originLink": "https://zeus.ugent.be/blog/23-24/open-source-esp32-wifi-mac/",
    "originBody": "The ESP32 is a popular microcontroller known in the maker community for its low price (~ €5) and useful features: it has a dual-core CPU, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity and 520 KB of RAM. It is also used commercially, in devices ranging from smart CO₂-meters to industrial automation controllers. Most of the software development kit that is used to program for the ESP32 is open-source, except notably the wireless bits (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, low-level RF functions): that functionality is distributed as precompiled libraries, that are then compiled into the firmware the developer writes. A closed-source Wi-Fi implementation has several disadvantages compared to an open-source implementation though: You are dependent on the vendor (Espressif in this case) to add features; if you have a somewhat non-standard usecase, you might be out of luck. For example, standards-compliant mesh networking (IEEE 802.11s) is not supported on the ESP32; there is a partially closed-source mesh networking implementation made by Espressif, but this is rather limited: the mesh network has a tree topology, and uses NAT on the nodes connected to the root network, making it hard to connect from outside the mesh network to nodes in the mesh network. The protocol is also not documented, so it’s not interoperable with other devices. It’s hard to audit the security of the implementation: since there is no source code available, you have to resort to black-box fuzzing and reverse engineering to find security vulnerabilities. Additionally, an open-source implementation would make research into low-power Wi-Fi mesh networking more affordable; if each node only costs about €5, research involving hundreds of nodes can be affordable on a modest budget. Espressif has an open issue in their esp32-wifi-lib repository, asking to open-source the MAC layer. In that issue, they confirmed in 2016 that open sourcing the upper MAC is on their roadmap, but as of 2023, nothing has been published yet. Having the source code would for example allow us to implement proper 802.11s-compliant mesh networking. Goals The main goal of this project is to build a minimal replacement for Espressifs proprietary Wi-Fi binary blobs. We don’t intend to be API-compatible with existing code that uses the Espressif ESP-IDF API, rather, we’d like to have a fully working, open source networking stack. The rest of this section will contain information about how the network stack and Wi-Fi (the 802.11 standard) works, so if you’re already familiar, you can skip it. OSI model of the network stack (the difference between application/presentation/session is a bit murky) Above, you can see a diagram showing the network stack. Computer networking is done with a network stack, where every layer in the stack has its own purpose; this design makes it easier to swap out layers and allows for separate development of layers. The layer at the bottom of the stack interacts with the physical world (for example, by using radiowaves or electric signals); every layer adds their own features. Wi-Fi (also known as the 802.11 standard by engineers) is implemented in the bottom two layers: the PHY layer (what the radio waveforms look like, …) and the MAC layer (how we connect to an access point, what packets exist, how to send packets to local devices, …). On the ESP32, the PHY layer is implemented in hardware; most of the MAC layer is implemented in the proprietary blob. One notable exception to this separation is sending acknowlegement frame: if a device receives a frame, it should send a packet back to acknowledge that this packet was received correctly. This ACK packet needs to be sent within ~10 microseconds; it would be hard to get this timing correct in software. There are 3 types of MAC frames: Management frames: mostly for managing the connection between the access point and station (client) Control frames: help with delivery of other types of frames (for example ACK, but also request-to-send and clear-to-send) Data frames: contain the data of the layers above the MAC layer Previous work Since it doesn’t look like Espressif will release an open source MAC implementation anytime soon, we’re on our own to create this. This is rather hard to do, because the hardware with which we send and receive 802.11 packets on the ESP32 is entirely undocumented. This means that we will need to reverse engineer the hardware; first we’ll need to document what the hardware does, then we’ll need to write our own code to correctly interact with it. In 2021, Uri Shaked did some very light reverse engineering of ESP32 Wi-Fi hardware, to mock this in his emulator. That way, programs for the ESP32 can be emulated instead of running them on real hardware. Shaked gave a talk about this, but only discussed very high level details about the hardware. Espressif has their own fork of QEMU (a popular, open-source emulator) that can also emulate the ESP32, but this fork does not support emulating the Wi-Fi hardware. In 2022, Martin Johnson added basic support for the Wi-Fi hardware to their own fork of Espressif’s QEMU. The emulated ESP32 can connect to a virtual access point, or have a virtual client connect to it. esp-idf (the SDK for the ESP32) has a function to transmit frames (esp_wifi_80211_tx), but this function only accepts certain types of frames; it does not allow sending most management frames, severely limiting the usefulness of this API to base an 802.11 MAC stack on. They also have a function (esp_wifi_set_promiscuous_rx_cb) to receive a callback on reception of a frame. Tools Before we can start reverse engineering how the 802.11 PHY hardware works and how we interact with it, we first need to find or build tools that will help. We’ll use 3 main approaches: Static reverse engineering: we have the compiled libraries that implement the Wi-Fi stack, so we can look at the compiled code and try to decompile it to human-readable code. From this more readable code, we then try to see what the hardware expects the software to do. Dynamic code analysis in an emulator: we can run the firmware in an emulator and inspect how it interacts with the virtual hardware. This has the advantage of having a lot of freedom to how we inspect the hardware, but the disadvantage that the emulator might not behave the same as real hardware. Since we’ll need to write the emulated peripherals ourselves, this risk is real: there is no public datasheet for the Wi-Fi peripheral, so we have to guess how the hardware will behave from the code that interacts with it. Dynamic code analysis on real hardware: we can run the firmware on an actual ESP32, and debug it using a JTAG debugger. This allows us to place breakpoints, inspect the memory and registers, stop and resume the execution, … The disadvantage is that the debugging capabilities are more limited compared to running in an emulator: we can only place 2 breakpoints, we cannot place watchpoints (breakpoints that trigger on memory reads/writes to a certain address), … The big advantage compared to using an emulator is that we’ll know for sure that the behaviour of the hardware is correct. Static analysis For the static analysis, we use Ghidra, an open-source reverse engineering tool made by the NSA. Out of the box, Ghidra does not have support yet for Xtensa (the CPU architecture of the ESP32), but there is a plugin that adds support. The build tools used in the ESP32 SDK generate both an ELF file (a type of binary file that can contain metadata) and a flat binary file: using the ELF file has the benefit of automatically setting most function names. Dynamic analysis in emulator We started off from Martin Johnsons’s fork of Espressifs version of QEMU (a popular open-source emulator), and ported their changes to the latest version of Espressif’s QEMU fork. The ESP32 talks to its peripherals via memory mapped IO: by reading from and writing to certain memory addresses, the peripherals provides information to the CPU and does things. To help in reverse engineering, we added log statements to the QEMU Wi-Fi peripherals that log every access to their memory ranges. Additionally, we also implemented stack unwinding in QEMU; this is done for every memory access to a hardware peripheral related to Wi-Fi. That way, we can get a full stack trace for every peripheral access. Symbols are not stripped, so this is a very useful tool. However, to get stack unwinding properly working, we have to run QEMU in single step mode: QEMU has a JIT compiler that compiles sequences of emulated assembly instructions into optimized basic blocks. This greatly improves the execution speed, but since the CPU execution state is only guaranteed to be correct at the beginning of a basic block, if a peripheral memory access happens in the middle of such a basic block, the stack unwinding algorithm gives wrong results. Running in single-step mode negates much of the benefit of the QEMU JIT compiler, causing the code to run much slower. This is not that big of a disadvantage, compared to the treasure trove of information the execution trace gives us. Below is an example of a single memory access logged by QEMU: it’s a write (W) to address 3ff46094 with value 00010005, done by the function ram_pbus_force_test. The rest of the callstack is also logged, and translated to a symbol name if available. W 3ff46094 00010005 ram_pbus_force_test 400044f4 set_rx_gain_cal_dc set_rx_gain_testchip_70 set_rx_gain_table bb_init register_chipv7_phy esp_phy_load_cal_and_init esp_phy_enable wifi_hw_start wifi_start_process ieee80211_ioctl_process ppTask vPortTaskWrapper Finally, we also corrected the handling of MAC addresses (compared to Martin Johnsons version), so that a packet capture has correct MAC addresses in packets instead of hardcoded addresses. Dynamic analysis on real hardware To dynamically analyze the firmware on real hardware, we use the JTAG hardware debugging interface. By connecting some jumper wires between the ESP32 and a JTAG debugger, we can debug the ESP32. We followed the steps described in this GitHub repository to get our JTAG debugger (CJMCU-232H) working. In additon to the JTAG debugger, we also connected a USB Wi-Fi dongle directly to the ESP32: the ESP32-WROOM-32U variant of the ESP32 has an antenna connector. We connect that antenna connector to a 60 dB attenuator (this weakens the signal by 60dB), then connect that to the antenna connector of the wireless dongle. That way we’ll be able to only receive the packets coming from the ESP32, and the ESP32 will only receive packets sent by the wireless dongle. This idea unfortunately did not entirely work: enough radio waves from outside access points leaked into the antenna connector that the wireless dongle also receieved their packets. We tried to build a low-cost faraday cage from a paint can to prevent this, but this only attenuated outside signals with an extra 10dB: this removed some APs, but not all of them. The current solution is definitely not ideal, so we’ve started work on building a better and larger faraday cage, from conducting fabric and with fiber-optic data communication. Wi-Fi dongle connected to the ESP32, with two 30 dB attenuators in between Faraday cage made from a paint tin, with copper tape to close the hole for the USB connectors, and ferrite chokes to reduce the RF leaking in Architecture SoftMAC vs HardMAC SoftMAC (Software MAC) and HardMAC (Hardware MAC) refer to two different approaches for implementing the MAC layer for Wi-Fi. SoftMAC relies on software to manage MAC layer functions, which offers flexibility and ease of modification but can consume more power/CPU cycles. HardMAC, on the other hand, offloads MAC layer processing to dedicated hardware, reducing CPU usage and power consumption but limiting the ability to adapt to new features without hardware changes. The ESP32 seems to use a SoftMAC approach: you can directly send and receive 802.11 frames (instead of with HardMAC, where you tell the hardware you want to connect to a certain AP, and it would then automatically craft the nescessary frames and send them). This is good news for our open source implementation, since there already exist open-source 802.11 MAC stacks for SoftMAC (for example, mac80211 in the Linux kernel). Peripherals The Wi-Fi functionality is implemented via multiple hardware peripherals, each responsible for a separate part of the functionality. Through reverse engineering, the following peripherals were identified as ‘used for Wi-Fi functionaliy’ (these are memory addresses, through which the peripherals can be accessed): MAC peripherals, at 0x3ff73000 to 0x3ff73fff and at 0x3ff74000 to 0x3ff74fff RX control registers, at 0x3ff5c000 to 0x3ff5cfff baseband, at 0x3ff5d000 to 0x3ff5dfff chipv7_phy (?) at 3ff71000 to 3ff71fff chipv7_wdev (?) at 3ff75000 to 3ff75fff RF frontend, at 3ff45000 to 3ff45fff and 3ff46000 to 3ff46fff analog at 3ff4e000 to 3ff4efff (this is also used by the DAC connected to GPIO pins) It should be noted that these peripherals are mirrored to another place in the address space: Peripherals accessed by the CPU via 0x3FF40000 ~ 0x3FF7FFFF address space (DPORT address) can also be accessed via 0x60000000 ~ 0x6003FFFF (AHB address). (0x3FF40000 + n) address and (0x60000000 + n) address access the same content, where n = 0 ~ 0x3FFFF. Lifecyle By writing some minimal firmware that just sends packets in a loop and using the three reverse engineer strategies described earlier, a high level overview of the Wi-Fi hardware lifecycle for sending a packet was determined: Calling esp_wifi_start(), this indirectly calls esp_phy_enable() esp_phy_enable() is responsible for initializing the wifi hardware: Calibrate the PHY hardware: this tries to compensate imperfections of the hardware. According to the data sheet, this does, at least: I/Q phase matching; antenna matching; compensating carrier leakage, baseband nonlinearities, power amplifier nonlinearities and RF nonlinearities (I’m more of a software person than an electronic engineer, so I don’t exactly know what these terms mean). This calibration can be stored to the non-volatile storage and to memory. This is used so we don’t have to do a full calibration every time the ESP32 wakes up from modem sleep. Initialize the MAC peripherals: set RX MAC address filters, set the buffers where the packets will be received into, set the auto-ACKing policy, set the chips own MAC address. Set various physical radio properties (TX rate, frequency, TX power, …) Set up the power management timer: if packets are not sent often enough, the modem power save timer kicks in and de-initializes part of the Wi-Fi hardware to save power. Now, we’re ready to send a packet: Wake up some Wi-Fi peripherals from deep sleep and restore their calibration, if we need to Set some metadata, related to the packet (likely the rate and other PHY settings) Create a DMA entry, consisting of the length of the packet and the address of the buffer containing the MAC data. The MAC Frame Checksum is automatically calculated by the hardware. DMA stands for Direct Memory Access: that means that we just tell the hardware the address and length of where our packet is, and the hardware will then read that memory and transmit the packet, all on its own. Write the lowest bits of the DMA entry into a hardware register, then enable it for transmission by setting a bit in the bitmask of that register. Once the packet is sent, interrupt 0 will fire to notify us how succesful the transmission was. We can react to collisions and timeouts (and probably also to ACKs received?). We also have to clear the interrupt bit that indicates a packet was sent. Implementing transmitting packets As a (very limited) proof-of-concept, we wanted to send arbitrary 802.11 frames by directly using the memory mapped peripherals, so without using the SDK functions. As you can see in the lifecycle diagram above, before transmitting, we first need to initialize the wifi hardware. Unfortunately, this initialization is a lot more complex than sending packets: to intialize the hardware, about 50000 peripheral memory accesses are needed, compared to about 50 for transmitting a packet (including handling the interrupt). These are not exact numbers at all, but they give an idea about the complexity involved. For the basic ‘transmitting packets’ proof-of-concept, we are currently still using the proprietary functions to initialize the wifi hardware. We encountered the issue that after initializing, the modem power save timer would kick in and de-initialize the wifi peripherals, preventing us from sending packets. To work around this, we send a single packet using the SDK and then immediately call the undocumented pm_disconnected_stop() function, which disables the modem power save mode timer. After this, we can send arbitrary packets by directly writing to the MAC peripheral addresses. For this PoC, we don’t need to replace the interrupt handler for wifi events: the existing, proprietary handler will handle the ‘packet was sent’ interrupt just fine. The basic proof of concept works, we can transmit arbitrary packets by directly writing and reading from memory addresses! Current roadmap Now we can transmit packets, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us: this is the to-do list, in rough order of priorities ☑ Send packets ☐ Receive packets: to do this, we will need to do the following: Set the RX policy (this filters packets based on MAC address) / enable promiscous mode to receive all packets Set the memory address in which we want to receive the packet via DMA Replace the wifi interrupt with our own interrupt; the code indicates that there might be some kind of wifi watchdog, we’ll need to figure out how to pet it. ☐ Send ACK (acknowledgment) packets back if we receive a packet that is destined for us ☐ Implement changing the wifi channel, rate, transmit power, … ☐ Combine our implementation with an existing open source 802.11 MAC stack, so the ESP32 can associate with access points ☐ Implement the hardware initialization (now done by esp_phy_enable()). This will be a hard undertaking, since all calibration routines will need to be implemented, but also has a high payoff: we’ll then have a completely blob-free firmware for the ESP32. And a list of possible future extensions that are not yet on the roadmap, but are useful to do anyways: ☐ Implement modem power saving: turning off the modem when not in use ☐ AMSDU, AMPDU, HT40, QoS ☐ Do the cryptography needed for WPA2 etc in hardware instead of in software ☐ Bluetooth ☐ Write SVD documentation for all reverse engineered registers. An SVD file is an XML file that describes the hardware features of a microcontroller, this makes it possible to automatically generate an API from the hardware description. Espressif already has an SVD file containing the documented hardware registers; we can document the undocumented registers and (automatically) merge them in. Code All code and documentation is available in the esp32-open-mac GitHub organisation. I think especially the QEMU fork can be useful for other reverse engineers because of the memory tracing feature. Update Since the beginning of writing this blog post, receiving packets was also implemented. To accomplish this, we needed to implement the Wi-Fi MAC interrupt handler and manage the RX DMA buffers. This means that we now can send and receive packets using only open source code: the hardware initialization is still done with proprietary code, but after this setup is done, only open source code is used to send and receive packets, no more proprietary code is executed. The second part is here Questions? Want to collaborate?

This feeds a tiny paranoia I have at the back of my head when dealing with esp32&#x2F;espressif. I have dozens of esp32s around and I love them, but Espressif is 100% Chinese.Im uncomfortable with what I read that every company of significant size in China automatically requires CCP party members to be involved in the company at a high level.So Im very happy to hear people such as these guys are looking deep at this.Ofcourse since Espressif controls the hardware, so they can do anything eventually. My itch will always be there and Im going to switch once I find something made in preferably the EU when I find something comparable to esp32. Maybe Nordic Semiconductors will make some nice risk-v chips and dev-boards soon. reply RF_Savage 3 hours agoparentIt is because of FCC certification requirements. Usually, if the end user can modify the lowlevel radio firmware on the device, the device looses it&#x27;s FCC certification and cannot be sold in USA.It also seems that Espressif has bought their wifi IP, so their contracts and licensing terms with the IP vendor likely prevent any sharing.But FCC is the reason for closed binary blob firmware for all wifi radios out there these days. reply dariosalvi78 2 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t understand how the license affects certification TBH. As this post clearly shows users can implement their own stack if they really want to, it&#x27;s not that the license is going to prevent them. Why can&#x27;t one have an open source stack with specific builds that are approved, tested and certified? reply RF_Savage 1 hour agorootparentThey could, but somebody would have to write that FOSS wifistack. You could not run selfcompiled versions of the stack on any hardware that has been FCC certified, because if you could, the certs would be gone once again.Wifi is shared spectrum and devices using are licenced to make sure they conform to the local regulations. One size does not fit all. For example 2.4GHz wifi channel 13 is legal in EU, but in USA it falls on a govt owned band. This is why companies like Mikrotik or Ubiquiti have specific hardware versions for USA. So that they verifiably cannot be set on illegal channels by the enduser. reply ajsnigrutin 10 hours agoparentprevWifi is easy... there&#x27;s no way to send anything undetected, since you control the routers, etc.GSM->5G modems are a lot harder to debug... maybe now in recent years with cheaper SDRs, but a lot harder then wifi.And not sure why you&#x27;d be afraid of CCP, we saw the wikileaks, USA does a lot of similiarly bad stuff too and even got caught doing it... and if you live in a \"western\" country, USA has much easier access to you than China. reply simondotau 4 hours agorootparentThere’s no point having a vague Chinese back door in Espressif devices which security researchers could discover with relative ease.

When someone raises this concern, the response \"the USA has a history of surveiling its citizens\" is not a rebuttal, it&#x27;s irrelevant. Thus a whataboutism.2) Your burden of proof might be different from mine, but one needs to be pretty naive to think that the CCP doesn&#x27;t surveil western citizens.

The entire framework and toolchains are open-source for one thing. You get listings and sometimes pseudo-code for the internal ROMs (though no code). You get full access to datasheets, technical reference, and sdk documentation. Everything in their SDK is documented. You even get help on github. All of that accessible to anyone anywhere at any time.Contrast that to the last time I worked with Nordic in a professional manner, I had to sign NDAs to get the full documentation and toolchain. Their toolchain contained binary blobs that when inquired about you get told \"don&#x27;t worry about it ;)\" which is shockingly frustrating when a crash occurs in them and you&#x27;re left trying to work around it. And if you&#x27;re not a professional you&#x27;re basically SOL and left with half-baked community toolchains, when they exist for a particular chip. reply dromtrund 1 hour agorootparent> Contrast that to the last time I worked with Nordic in a professional manner, I had to sign NDAs to get the full documentation and toolchainThat has to be at least 5 years ago, but even back then, 99% of their software was out in the open.

Their support is done on an open forum and complete data sheets are available both as PDFs and (with the exception of the nRF51) as web pages.

The legal requirements essentially mandate 30dB + manufacturing safety margin.

Last night I prototyped some code in Python on my Mac to talk to a Bluetooth peripheral, and then had ChatGPT translate it to Arduino C++ code for a $5 ESP32, and it mostly worked on the first go.You can even run Python on microcontrollers these days. See Adafruit&#x27;s https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circuitpython.org for which they publish modules for many (almost all?) of the sensors they sell. The modern microcontroller frameworks hide much of the complexity of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, filesystems, etc. so you can do complicated things with minimal effort. You can really cobble something together in an afternoon.The \"hello world\" of microcontrollers is making an LED blink. Then figuring out how to print a message out over serial (print debugging is invaluable). Then maybe figure out how to make a Wi-Fi connection and an HTTP request. Then go on a shopping spree on Adafruit or SparkFun for $9 sensors that spark your imagination and figure out how to talk to them; Adafruit publishes zillions of tutorials you can copy from: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.adafruit.com reply jof 9 hours agoparentprevMake an LED blink.Then, connect an RGB LED and experiment with PWM signal generation.Then, experiment with network programming, accepting a UDP packet to the ESP32 that sets the color of the RGB LED. reply PeterisP 9 hours agorootparentAlternatively, you can go high-level immediately - instead of accepting a UDP packet to set the color, run a webserver on it with functionality to change the RGB LED color that you can access from any browser. Modern microcontrollers have enough resources to just spend them like that. reply zlg_codes 9 hours agorootparentAre we talking lightweight servers like minihttp and shizaru, mid-level lighttpd , or big-ass Apache and nginx? reply PeterisP 9 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re talking lighter than minihttp and shizaru - instead of a separate process on an OS, you&#x27;d use library that allows your firmware to respond to http requests, but that still allows you to run all the relatively complex UI&#x2F;UX code on the user&#x27;s computer or phone, with the microcontroller only handling the physical functionality; and reduces the need to have and manage more physical buttons&#x2F;lights&#x2F;screens&#x2F;etc on the device itself; but you can do that without writing a separate app to generate some custom command&control messages - as in the grandparent post example of encoding RGB light control in an UDP packet, it would probably need three times the amount of code both on sending and receiving side compared to a http-based rgb control, which can probably be done in ten or so lines of your own code. reply zlg_codes 8 hours agorootparentOh, that&#x27;s pretty neat. Basically trimming the server down to the routing itself. 1. accept HTTP 2. check for valid endpoint 3. if yes, do thing and exit 4. if no, &#x27;error&#x27;Client side has fancy UI for essentially templating per-HTTP request or command sent to the device.I guess the only issue I see is you&#x27;d need some sort of firewalling or security. Otherwise any rando could fire HTTP requests at the thing and make it do stuff.How would you structure this on the device&#x27;s side?

FCC concerns about radio power occur at the PHY layer, OSI Layer 1:> On the ESP32, the PHY layer is implemented in hardware; most of the MAC layer is implemented in the proprietary blob. One notable exception to this separation is sending acknowlegement frame: if a device receives a frame, it should send a packet back to acknowledge that this packet was received correctly. This ACK packet needs to be sent within ~10 microseconds; it would be hard to get this timing correct in software.* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pics.zeus.gent&#x2F;vYXyQm2t9pJCzpDdWFvq9oWR2DACoUJoTsYf8... reply crote 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not that simple. Besides implementing a SoftMAC, the blob is also responsible for setting up the PHY, so it would definitely be able to adjust things like transmitting power.

    "originBody": "MORE FUN WITH FIRMWARE — Just about every Windows and Linux device vulnerable to new LogoFAIL firmware attack UEFIs booting Windows and Linux devices can be hacked by malicious logo images. Dan Goodin - 12/6/2023, 3:02 PM Enlarge Getty Images reader comments 188 Hundreds of Windows and Linux computer models from virtually all hardware makers are vulnerable to a new attack that executes malicious firmware early in the boot-up sequence, a feat that allows infections that are nearly impossible to detect or remove using current defense mechanisms. The attack—dubbed LogoFAIL by the researchers who devised it—is notable for the relative ease in carrying it out, the breadth of both consumer- and enterprise-grade models that are susceptible, and the high level of control it gains over them. In many cases, LogoFAIL can be remotely executed in post-exploit situations using techniques that can’t be spotted by traditional endpoint security products. And because exploits run during the earliest stages of the boot process, they are able to bypass a host of defenses, including the industry-wide Secure Boot, Intel’s Secure Boot, and similar protections from other companies that are devised to prevent so-called bootkit infections. Game over for platform security LogoFAIL is a constellation of two dozen newly discovered vulnerabilities that have lurked for years, if not decades, in Unified Extensible Firmware Interfaces responsible for booting modern devices that run Windows or Linux. The vulnerabilities are the product of almost a year’s worth of work by Binarly, a firm that helps customers identify and secure vulnerable firmware. The vulnerabilities are the subject of a coordinated mass disclosure released Wednesday. The participating companies comprise nearly the entirety of the x64 and ARM CPU ecosystem, starting with UEFI suppliers AMI, Insyde, and Phoenix (sometimes still called IBVs or independent BIOS vendors); device manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, and HP; and the makers of the CPUs that go inside the devices, usually Intel, AMD or designers of ARM CPUs. The researchers unveiled the attack on Wednesday at the Black Hat Security Conference in London. Advertisement The affected parties are releasing advisories that disclose which of their products are vulnerable and where to obtain security patches. Links to advisories and a list of vulnerability designations appears at the end of this article. As its name suggests, LogoFAIL involves logos, specifically those of the hardware seller that are displayed on the device screen early in the boot process, while the UEFI is still running. Image parsers in UEFIs from all three major IBVs are riddled with roughly a dozen critical vulnerabilities that have gone unnoticed until now. By replacing the legitimate logo images with identical-looking ones that have been specially crafted to exploit these bugs, LogoFAIL makes it possible to execute malicious code at the most sensitive stage of the boot process, which is known as DXE, short for Driver Execution Environment. “Once arbitrary code execution is achieved during the DXE phase, it’s game over for platform security,” researchers from Binarly, the security firm that discovered the vulnerabilities, wrote in a whitepaper. “From this stage, we have full control over the memory and the disk of the target device, thus including the operating system that will be started.” From there, LogoFAIL can deliver a second-stage payload that drops an executable onto the hard drive before the main OS has even started. The following video demonstrates a proof-of-concept exploit created by the researchers. The infected device—a Gen 2 Lenovo ThinkCentre M70s running an 11th-Gen Intel Core with a UEFI released in June—runs standard firmware defenses, including Secure Boot and Intel Boot Guard. LogoFAIL. In an email, Binarly founder and CEO Alex Matrosov wrote: LogoFAIL is a newly discovered set of high-impact security vulnerabilities affecting different image parsing libraries used in the system firmware by various vendors during the device boot process. These vulnerabilities are present in most cases inside reference code, impacting not a single vendor but the entire ecosystem across this code and device vendors where it is used. This attack can give a threat actor an advantage in bypassing most endpoint security solutions and delivering a stealth firmware bootkit that will persist in a firmware capsule with a modified logo image.

Any vulnerability that requires local access can be exploited if you first get remote code execution through another vulnerability. Also, exploiting the browser or the media player doesn&#x27;t give you admin privileges, you need another privilege escalation exploit for that. reply tuetuopay 51 minutes agoparentWhat make this vulnerability frightening is- the persistence that’s nearly perfect- an av cannot detect it ever- it bypasses all forms of secure boot by getting code exec at the earliest of stages in the boot chain of trust- the disassemblies show that the bios vendors did not even remotely try to make the parser secure. it is a joke. and if an image parser is that bad, I can’t even imagine the quality of usb or network stacks reply K0balt 12 hours agoparentprev [–] But this makes the access persistent, and allows the removal of all evidence of the initial penetration, survives OS patching, vulnerability scanning, etc. reply adrians1 11 hours agorootparent [–] Agree, it&#x27;s a serious vulnerability, but it&#x27;s not exploitable remotely. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
