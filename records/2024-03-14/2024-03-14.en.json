    "originBody": "Research A generalist AI agent for 3D virtual environments Published 13 March 2024 Authors By the SIMA Team Share We present new research on a Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent (SIMA) that can follow natural-language instructions to carry out tasks in a variety of video game settings Video games are a key proving ground for artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Like the real world, games are rich learning environments with responsive, real-time settings and ever-changing goals. From our early work with Atari games, through to our AlphaStar system that plays StarCraft II at human-grandmaster level, Google DeepMind has a long history in AI and games. Today, we’re announcing a new milestone - shifting our focus from individual games towards a general, instructable game-playing AI agent. In a new technical report, we introduce SIMA, short for Scalable Instructable Multiworld Agent, a generalist AI agent for 3D virtual settings. We partnered with game developers to train SIMA on a variety of video games. This research marks the first time an agent has demonstrated it can understand a broad range of gaming worlds, and follow natural-language instructions to carry out tasks within them, as a human might. This work isn't about achieving high game scores. Learning to play even one video game is a technical feat for an AI system, but learning to follow instructions in a variety of game settings could unlock more helpful AI agents for any environment. Our research shows how we can translate the capabilities of advanced AI models into useful, real-world actions through a language interface. We hope that SIMA and other agent research can use video games as sandboxes to better understand how AI systems may become more helpful. Learning from video games Pause Play We collaborated with eight game studios to train and test SIMA on nine different video games. To expose SIMA to many environments, we’ve built a number of partnerships with game developers for our research. We collaborated with eight game studios to train and test SIMA on nine different video games, such as No Man’s Sky by Hello Games and Teardown by Tuxedo Labs. Each game in SIMA’s portfolio opens up a new interactive world, including a range of skills to learn, from simple navigation and menu use, to mining resources, flying a spaceship, or crafting a helmet. We also used four research environments - including a new environment we built with Unity called the Construction Lab, where agents need to build sculptures from building blocks which test their object manipulation and intuitive understanding of the physical world. By learning from different gaming worlds, SIMA captures how language ties in with game-play behavior. Our first approach was to record pairs of human players across the games in our portfolio, with one player watching and instructing the other. We also had players play freely, then rewatch what they did and record instructions that would have led to their game actions. SIMA comprises pre-trained vision models, and a main model that includes a memory and outputs keyboard and mouse actions. SIMA: a versatile AI agent SIMA is an AI agent that can perceive and understand a variety of environments, then take actions to achieve an instructed goal. It comprises a model designed for precise image-language mapping and a video model that predicts what will happen next on-screen. We finetuned these models on training data specific to the 3D settings in the SIMA portfolio. Our AI agent doesn’t need access to a game's source code, nor bespoke APIs. It requires just two inputs: the images on screen, and simple, natural-language instructions provided by the user. SIMA uses keyboard and mouse outputs to control the games’ central character to carry out these instructions. This simple interface is what humans use, meaning SIMA can potentially interact with any virtual environment. The current version of SIMA is evaluated across 600 basic skills, spanning navigation (e.g. \"turn left\"), object interaction (\"climb the ladder\"), and menu use (\"open the map\"). We’ve trained SIMA to perform simple tasks that can be completed within about 10 seconds. Pause Play SIMA was evaluated across 600 basic skills, spanning navigation, object interaction, and menu use. We want our future agents to tackle tasks that require high-level strategic planning and multiple sub-tasks to complete, such as “Find resources and build a camp”. This is an important goal for AI in general, because while Large Language Models have given rise to powerful systems that can capture knowledge about the world and generate plans, they currently lack the ability to take actions on our behalf. Generalizing across games and more We show an agent trained on many games was better than an agent that learned how to play just one. In our evaluations, SIMA agents trained on a set of nine 3D games from our portfolio significantly outperformed all specialized agents trained solely on each individual one. What’s more, an agent trained in all but one game performed nearly as well on that unseen game as an agent trained specifically on it, on average. Importantly, this ability to function in brand new environments highlights SIMA’s ability to generalize beyond its training. This is a promising initial result, however more research is required for SIMA to perform at human levels in both seen and unseen games. Our results also show that SIMA’s performance relies on language. In a control test where the agent was not given any language training or instructions, it behaves in an appropriate but aimless manner. For example, an agent may gather resources, a frequent behavior, rather than walking where it was instructed to go. We evaluated SIMA’s ability to follow instructions to complete nearly 1500 unique in-game tasks, in part using human judges. As our baseline comparison, we use the performance of environment-specialized SIMA agents (trained and evaluated to follow instructions within a single environment). We compare this performance with three types of generalist SIMA agents, each trained across multiple environments. Advancing AI agent research SIMA’s results show the potential to develop a new wave of generalist, language-driven AI agents. This is early-stage research and we look forward to further building on SIMA across more training environments and incorporating more capable models. As we expose SIMA to more training worlds, the more generalizable and versatile we expect it to become. And with more advanced models, we hope to improve SIMA’s understanding and ability to act on higher-level language instructions to achieve more complex goals. Ultimately, our research is building towards more general AI systems and agents that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world.

Dota is an insanely complicated and difficult game. This was an eye opening moment for me that led to a career shift. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Five reply jsheard 17 hours agoparentThe caveat being that the scope of the game was significantly pared down for the sake of the AI. Specifically the team compositions were pre-determined, meaning the AI only had to understand 10 heroes in two specific arrangements of 5, when there's normally >100* heroes which can be chosen in any permutation, and certain game mechanics were also declared off-limits for the human players because the AI wasn't able to understand them. Beating pros in that subset of the game was an impressive achievement but there was a huge gulf between what they did and doing it in the full version of the game, which they quickly gave up on trying to do after collecting their marketing trophy of beating Dota pros in something resembling Dota. * I'm not sure exactly how many heroes there were at the time, it was less than the 124 there are today, but it was certainly a lot more than 10. reply avree 17 hours agorootparentThere were 112 heroes available at that time. It's also worth noting that two of the heros chosen for OpenAI to use, Viper and Sniper, are considered some of the mechanically 'easier' heroes, as they rely primarily on autoattacks to do damage, as oppose to decision-making around when to use spells. Crystal Maiden, Lich, and Necrophos, the other 3 of the 5 OpenAI heros, are similarly considered 'easier' as they have spammable, very forgiving abilities that can be used almost indiscriminately. reply FrustratedMonky 12 hours agorootparentbaby steps. Still impressive. AlphaGo was strait up same. AlhaStar did have some limits placed to narrow it down for the AI. But was still imperfect information, and wildly complicated. And those were all 3+ years ago. Games are a lower resolution representation of the 'real' world. And we haven't seen any slowing down of AI scaling up for more and more complex world views. Eventually the 'map' will be the 'real', as real as the human brains internal map of reality. reply Jensson 11 hours agorootparent> And we haven't seen any slowing down of AI scaling up for more and more complex world views. We absolutely have. We have superhuman performance on Go, we have human expect level performance at Starcraft, and now we get human baby level performance at 3d games. The more complex the task/game the worse the AI gets relative humans it seems, I don't see how this shows the AI scaling up, to me this is all moving horizontally. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentI feel like the dimensional complexity of the problem space is disproportionately larger at each level than the gap in capability over that evolution. Each level of capability you described was science fiction stuff before they were achieved. They’re not in any way horizontal achievements. reply Jensson 3 hours agorootparent> I feel like the dimensional complexity of the problem space is disproportionately larger at each level than the gap in capability over that evolution But you acknowledge that things slowed down as we moved into more complex domains? Then you agree with my comment, the person I responded to said that things didn't slow down as we moved towards more complex domains, but there is no way you can say they haven't. AlphaStar and AlphaGo quickly competed and could beat top humans, the domains they worked with after that went way slower and still can't compete with top humans. > Each level of capability you described was science fiction stuff before they were achieved. They’re not in any way horizontal achievements. The second statement doesn't follow from the first, moving horizontally by applying the same things to a new domain can still unlock massive capabilities that we didn't have before. reply XenophileJKO 8 hours agorootparentprevI feel like this isn't a fair characterization. This is a \"general\" agent where the others are single environment. reply Jensson 3 hours agorootparentYes, this is more complex, that is cool. But we did see the slowing down as otherwise we would have maintained superhuman performance at every step, AlphaGo and Alphastar saw much quicker progress past human skill levels. reply benreesman 6 hours agorootparentprevI apologize in advance if this comes off as critical of you personally, you’re not saying anything that isn’t said constantly and I certainly don’t mean to single you out. With that said, we’ve got to strangle this meme. ML/AI moves forward in unpredictable fits and starts, it doesn’t follow e.g. Moore’s law in exponential formulation. When they’re doing research and not PR, researchers talk about “performance” on “tasks”, and define those terms rigorously. People have been trying to improve performance, as measured by some metric or metrics, on any number of tasks, since at least the 1950s. Certain periods of time generated breakthrough after breakthrough and a bunch of “well we’ll just scale it up and it’ll be a thinking machine” sentiment amongst the lay or semi-technical public, and similar grandiosity from experts when PR and/or funding are the objective. The world we live in I guess, but not a fire we on HN should be pouring fuel on. During other periods of time, we’ve hit the effective asymptote on the techniques thus far invented, the scaling dimensions flattened out. Then it’s all “AI was a fad, it’s hype, this is AI Winter”. There’s no robust consensus on when these summers and winters happen, how long they last, how much performance on one task is amenable to “transfer learning” regarding another task. It seems pretty random, the constant being the PR/funding talk. The years since AlexNet in 2011, word2vec in 2013, ResNet in 2016, Attention is All you Need in 2017, the GA on GPT-3 series just over a year ago, and countless other interesting things have been wildly fruitful, we’ve been on a hot streak. This is generally good news! The human race has new capabilities, win! But it’s a nearly impossible claim to defend that modern attention transformers are the final word on this area of endeavor, progress since then has been substantially brute-forced via unprecedented budgets achieved through subsidy of one kind or another, and there will continue to be periods of rapid progress unlocked by key insights, and there will continue to be less explosive periods of progress, and it serves no one with a plan more noble than “cash out while the spice flows” to tee up another collapse in interest, funding, and attention by pulling a Yud: a log scale and a ruler are never the complete toolkit on forecasting novel research. This stuff is incredibly cool stated as flat, consensus, rigorous science, it’s incredibly exciting to practitioners and laypeople alike without any breathless hyperventilation at all. The story thus far needs no grandiose embellishment to be thrilling. But the absolute best case in terms of research we currently know about as hyped by those seeking funding would be a nightmare end-state if it landed there (it won’t, but this disaster comes in degrees): right now the off-the wall exhilarating tech demos are so expensive that the public is effectively a spectator. There’s talk of multi-trillion dollar buildouts under complete, utterly unaccountable, ethically dubious control of people who crossed the “yikes is that even legal” line some time ago. A trillion dollars in 2024 is give or take thirty Manhattan Projects, the idea of handing that kind of scope to people who answer to no one, hold strong minority worldviews, and give the public the finger in print by calling the bribery department “OpenPhilanthropy”? Who the fuck thinks this isn’t a dystopian horror movie outcome in an already hyper fragile world? It’s time to squeeze the water out of these bloated, money is no object models, make them run on reasonable power budgets in the hands of John Q. Taxpayer (who along with a bunch of helpless civilians and service men and women, ultimately foots the tab when Nadella or Riyadh write blank checks one way or another), reform copyright law so that the commons isn’t vacuumed up, compressed, and copyrighted, and take a few whacks at shit like Jenson and Lisa Su being literally cousins while partitioning the market and gouging via API lock-in. The hyper, hyper-elite stand to gain even more immunity from all scrutiny, consequence, accountability, and even bad press if “AGI” turns out to be a mere 1-3 trillion in de facto blood money away from being locked in a vault somewhere. Literally everyone else stands to find out that slavery isn’t a strong enough word for what this would mean for them. reply FrustratedMonky 14 minutes agorootparentSo I'm downvoted for over-hyping? You went from: Start: \"we’ve got to strangle this meme. ML/AI moves forward in unpredictable fits and starts, it doesn’t follow e.g. Moore’s law in exponential formulation.\" At End: \"Who the fuck thinks this isn’t a dystopian horror movie outcome in an already hyper fragile world?\" Isn't that hype? By the end of the post you are doubling down on the over-hyped meme's. reply Etherlord87 13 hours agorootparentprevVery interesting! Shows how much AI is over-hyped (even though, as you say, it was very impressive anyway). It was even worse in case of Starcraft 2, where the AI had a much wider view than humans, and while the AI was supposed to show its strategic superiority, by limiting the APM (actions per minute), the limit was still very high, inspired by the max APM achieved by humans - whereas this max is achieved only for a very short period of time (a single minute), and consists mostly of insignificant click spam (had APM been limited to half that for humans, the effect would probably be negligible, and very minor for a quarter...). So as a result the AI would win by being able to micro-manage more units, rather than having a better strategy. But again, it was very impressive anyway. reply FrustratedMonky 12 hours agorootparentHow do you have 'over-hyped' and 'very impressive' in same sentence. Which is it? I think you are not giving AlphaStar the correct spin. They came back and changed it to only have the same viewport as the human, it could not see all of its units simultaneously, it had to move the cameras like a human. BUT importantly, it NEVER had perfect information. It could only see exactly the same as the human, just at one point they were letting it see the whole map without changing the camera, but it still could not see enemy units without sending a probe. And. Little unsure on what the argument about APM is saying. It was slowed down to match the human speed, but somehow that makes it less impressive? That is just making it more 'human-like'. Kind of like people today want to put guardrails on AI, but if it was unleashed, it beats them easily. That isn't a knock on the AI. The AI would still have to think about every move, and form a strategy. They slowed it down to human level inputs, handicapped it, to make it playable to a human. But to your point, if AI could make 400 APM and human had 400 APM (both limited to same), then that is better measure about the 'thought' behind each individual move. I still remember watching one match where the human was winning, the AI was down, and the AI really did fight back very aggressively from a loosing position, like a human. by expanding and adapting, and it looked very scary. reply Etherlord87 11 hours agorootparent> How do you have 'over-hyped' and 'very impressive' in same sentence. Which is it? I'm stunned; how would you think they are contradictory? Imagine a transportation that moves with the speed of 1000 km/h. Very impressive, right? Now imagine media everywhere say it moves with the speed of light. Wouldn't this be over-hyping? > BUT importantly, it NEVER had perfect information. It could only see exactly the same as the human Maybe we're speaking about different events... In the one I'm commenting on, the AI had some zoom-out, I think 2x (meaning it would see 4 times more at once). Yes it had fog of war, but a zoom out like this is a very significant advantage. > And. Little unsure on what the argument about APM is saying. It was slowed down to match the human speed, No it wasn't, not exactly. Imagine that you measure a human racer speed in km/minute, every minute. Then you take the highest measured \"average per minute\", and program AI to move with that speed at all times. Then you praise AI for its pathfinding algorithm, because using that speed, it beats the human racers. Yes, if a human racer has to slow down, because e.g. the human is unable to avoid obstacles at maximum speed, it does make the AI being able to move faster, impressive. But few people here would be impressed by a high reflex of a computer, because we all are used to the fact computers can react much faster than humans. It is misleading, however, to allow AI to move faster, and then give it the \"spin\", as you say, that the AI has won because it was smart, as opposed to being fast. BTW, I think the AI was either only using one race, or was playing only against one race. This one thing was actually mentioned in the event (once). The APM was mentioned too, I think, but the nuance I describe unfortunately wasn't mentioned. It makes me sad, because as I said, it is a very impressive technology. But it's hard to fully appreciate something when it is so blatantly over-hyped and when you see so many people around you being mislead and praising AI for achievements that it didn't exactly accomplish. reply FrustratedMonky 9 hours agorootparentYou are correct, there were limits on the AI in the event. It could only play 1 race, but I think the opposition could be different races. I think it was protoss, but it was playing terrans and zerg. There might have been 1 or 2 units that were also removed. In the first events where it was really dominant. It could see the whole map at once, and move its units all over the map by seeing it all. So moving units on both sides of the map practically simultaneously. BUT, this was called out as just too much of an advantage, so they made another version that actually had to move the camera around the map like a human. And the second version was still able to perform. Map wise though, for AI, I think the dealing with the fog of war and un-known/imperfect information was the big break through. Not the map size or speed. It still had to scout, and keep up with enemy movements that were hidden, and anticipate. The zoom out didn't provide that. I'm not totally buying the APM argument (but by end of the paragraph I do). Even if a computer can move 'faster', each move must mean something, do something worthwhile. So the computer must think out its moves. I know micro in SC2 is very big deal, and speed is essential, but you do have to know what to micro. The computer having 1000+ APM was called out also, and they added a limit. By throttling the AI to what a human can do, is handicapping the AI which isn't proving that AI isn't as good, it is showing that it can be better. Or another way, in Chess or GO, there is a time limit, but nobody is throttling the AI CPU to the same speed as a human brain, like limiting its computation cycles. So, guess in end, I do agree, throttling APM is like a real time imposing a time limit to each move, like in Chess. For Over-Hype/Impressive point. It is difficult. Both can be true. And everyone on the internet has different thresholds for what they think is over-hype and what is impressive. AI seems overwhelmed with both sides right now. Seemingly new miracles every day, and also over-hyped companies pumping their stock by adding an AI sticker to every product. I just say, those AlphaStar matches were like 5 years ago, and they still blow me away. Hard to imagine what could be possible, with this latest release in this post from deepmind. Plug into a camera, on a robot, with a gun, and tell it the world is just a 3d game. reply msp26 16 hours agorootparentprevOne of the constraints ended up being implemented into the main game: separate couriers for each player. But generally, agree with your point. But it's very cool how the OpenAI matches ended up making mid players reevaluate how they used consumable regen. reply nindalf 16 hours agorootparentExplanation - health potions cost a small amount of in game money and have to be ferried by a courier to the player. Most pros (and good players copying the pros) didn’t do this because it wasn’t considered cost effective. They would rather save up for a larger purchase. Until they repeatedly lost to OpenAI bots spending absurd amounts of money on health potions. The AI didn't follow \"best practice\" because it wasn't trained on human games, found a better way and that was quickly adopted by all, becoming the new best practice. reply murderfs 14 hours agorootparentLeague of Legends players discovered this like 15 years ago (the \"13 health pot start\"), I wonder why this didn't cross over. I suppose the player bases don't actually intersect very much? reply cptn_badass 12 hours agorootparentIt's mostly because it's was a different scarce resource at that time that was seen as non-optimal use by the players, the courier. It can ferry item to you, in a normal game there was only one of them for your whole team, which mean using it would take that ability away for your teammate during the ferry time. One constraint to those showmatches at the time was that every heroes had their own courier, and player at that point were not accustomed to using it for \"low value\" travel, unlike the AI that was using it liberally. In a later patch, the 1 courier per hero feature was added, and now pro players are much better at managing it, but at that time it was truly a heavy opportunity cost. reply mellinoe 2 hours agorootparentIIRC the couriers were invulnerable, making the strategy even stronger as you couldn't kill them to stop the flow of consumables. Also, according to this Q&A post on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/bf49yk) the consumable purchasing logic was scripted, not learned. reply evandale 13 hours agorootparentprevI think maybe the games are a bit different and it wasn't viable? I was pretty into the original WC3 Dota and starting with tangos for healing was a pretty popular strategy for supports and solo lane players. caveat: my Dota 2 knowledge is lacking because I haven't followed the game for about a decade now and I have essentially 0 experience with League. reply coffeebeqn 10 hours agorootparentprevSounds like any other game that AI powered search finds new optimal strategies. Chess , go, poker all have new strategies that no human thought of for hundreds of years. Some of them seem obvious in hindsight but that’s how knowledge works generally reply chse_cake 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's a fair assessment but it was also 6 years ago. Back then transformers had recently come out. Tricks to do DL at scale were still brewing. Even achieving what they did for 10 heroes showed DL could work in \"non-deterministic-ish\" problem settings. The more interesting question is: can we train a Dota model that plays with all 124 heroes today? reply iamdelirium 17 hours agoparentprevNot really. By only playing a certain subset of the game, the AI could use heroes that they were good at (micro intensive) while disallowing heroes that could counter the strategy the Open AI chose. Hardly a fair game. reply nsypteras 17 hours agoparentprevSo glad you said this!

What matters is that there are well-established rules defining scope.

The fact that it is (unaugmented) humans competing is the entire point. This is my thought/hope for what we'll expect in the coming years as AI's automation becomes more commonplace. Society's interests will start going towards activities that showcase human ability - sports, livestreaming (very much its own industry now, but mostly for socializing, art, and gaming), performance, dance, etc. Sure AI can 'do' these things, but not at the level elite performers can or with the subtle nuisances in human personalities. reply diego_sandoval 6 hours agorootparentprevOn the other hand, watching androids compete in physical sports is going to be pretty cool. reply thfuran 9 hours agorootparentprevIs it?

Even in the future when the AI is provide everything and we are no longer able to understand it, humans will be doing human competitions, playing chess, etc...

They didn't even get close to playing normal Dota at a high level, nevermind a hypothetical version of Dota which is twice as complex. reply everforward 15 hours agorootparentprevYou would need to define what kind of complexity. I would broadly break it into things that are complex to perform (crazy APMs or accuracy), things that are complex to understand (the stack or layers in MTG), and things that are complex to predict (e.g. time-delayed abilities and the correct time to use them, like Baptiste's lamp in Overwatch). AI have basically constant performance across a performance complexity curve, because the complexity typically derives from physical interfaces the AI doesn't use anyways. E.g. their APM is not limited by how fast their fingers can physically move. AIs do very poorly on tasks that are complex to understand. The best Magic: The Gathering AI's I've seen are awful (though also likely far less well-funded). Best-case scenario is basically an AI who makes plays that don't make any sense, but are at least valid plays. It's a crazy difficult problem. E.g. there are various ways to make infinite mana with combinations of cards, and the AI needs to a) realize that it can use those cards in order to create infinite mana, and b) that it can do this multiple times (I.e. it can pay for a spell that costs more mana the loop generates by going through the loop multiple times). That's very hard thing to do; human players somewhat frequently don't realize when they have loops. Add on top of that that a game of Magic can enter a state where a loop of effects becomes recursive but doesn't result in either player winning. The game is a draw, because it cannot progress anymore. Detecting these can be non-trivial, because they might involve side effects that look like someone should win (I.e. you lose a life and I gain one, then I gain 2 life, then you deal 1 damage to me, then I gain 1 life, then you deal 2 damage to me. Life totals shift around, but net to 0 by the end of the loop). I think the AI do well at complex prediction tasks as well, by nature of their response times and access to prior information. I would expect an AI to beat humans by a wider margin the more complex the prediction gets. Humans have finite time and thus experience; the AI is going to have more \"experience\", and be able to recall it at a faster rate. reply mminer237 17 hours agorootparentprevA big advantage of AIs is instant reaction time. OpenAI programmed in an artificial reaction delay to most skills, but they were still generally much faster than any human would be. Overall strategy is where the AI was lacking, but its technical flawlessness makes up for it. reply adtac 16 hours agorootparentIf we model the game as someone flicking switches, strategy is ability to know which switches to flick when whereas technical skill is the ability to quickly and precisely flick the chosen switches. In more complex games, there are more switches and the current set of best switches changes faster. With more switches, it's harder to know which are the best switches because the future is less predictable. And even if we figure out the best ones, they might change before we flick them. And even if we get around to it in time, we might fat finger it and accidentally flick an adjacent switch. And our opponent never gets tired or injured. This is why I suspect AIs have a much higher ceiling even if we limit them to half the APM pros have. Better strategy matters less, but I admit it's our only chance lol. FWIW, I've never played Dota but I've played a lot of AoE2 and from what I know they're similar enough (but maybe someone can correct me). reply CuriouslyC 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you're talking immediate mechanical complexity, then yes. If you're talking delayed strategic complexity, then definitely not. reply injuly 16 hours agoparentprevOh, that was wild. Though to be fair, the human players had to rely on muscle memory to win lanes (CSing, blocking waves, pulling, trading hits, cutting waves, stacking, etc.); whereas the AI could perfect the timings down to the fraction of a millisecond. reply ballenf 16 hours agorootparentWas there any control input limit on the AIs? Like if the AI couldn't click buttons or move the mouse faster than a very fast human. In a similar vein, it would be fascinating if the AI had to also evade bot detection, that is appear (nearly) indistinguishable from a human player. reply blharr 12 hours agorootparentSomewhat related, AlphaStar has such a control input limit for Starcraft limiting the actions per minute by some amount. reply kelvie 15 hours agorootparentprevIf I remember right there was a reaction time for the OpenAI team they could tweak, if I remember right it was around 200ms (and a short search I think confirms that). reply Jensson 14 hours agorootparentThe bot did perfectly dodge a skill that humans almost never dodged because it didn't have a good visual cue.

So many times we've been promised NPCs in RPGs that have their own lives, do their own things independent of the player, etc. and it's never really materialized into anything notable. With AI though, I feel like we may be getting close. reply digging 17 hours agoparentI'm suspicious of whether that will actually make games more fun or interesting. For example, the more realistic human character animations get, the deeper we seem to fall into the uncanny valley. The fact is that humans themselves naturally move in ways that look weird when put on a stage, so mocap tends to look sillier the better it is. Which is why we have theater, where movements are exaggerated. Anyway, with AI characters, I expect it will actually be more frustrating and boring than not if they have realistic lives and schedules. All the littler irritations that we deal with and accept form real people just become friction in a game. Games, as movies and books and shows and plays and illustrations, don't need to be more realistic to be better. Media is caricatures of real life, with important information intentionally presented to give us a good experience. Taking inspiration from real life can give us better mechanics but blindly mimicking real life will give us shitty games. reply Legend2440 16 hours agorootparentEveryone's a skeptic these days.

Of course unfun implementations would be unfun. But what the gp was clearly intending to suggest was fun implementations of more advanced NPC AI. And your responses are either ignoring that intention, or implying that it's unlikely to occur, both of which seem like being a downer and a skeptic just for the sake of being a skeptic. reply BoorishBears 2 hours agorootparentI can't tell if this is satire, but one of the \"rules that are always true, until they aren't\" in game design is that realism isn't fun (https://www.gamesradar.com/gabe-newell-says-games-dont-need-...) Games bend over backwards in a million ways not to be realistic even when they seem realistic: from silently helping your odds, to intentionally breaking physics (see: coyote running in platformers), to helping your movement align with enemies. Even the most realistic games with human locomotion almost all rely unrealistic ankle-breaking acceleration changes for your character because you'd feel like you were piloting a bowl of soup otherwise. The reason we don't have full agentic NPCs right now isn't a technical limitation: it just wouldn't be fun. Usually you're the hero going against impossible odds with NPCs, in the real world you'd just die. Games like GTA constantly have NPCs saying outlandish but comical quips at a rate that far surpasses real life. Hard coded NPC behaviors in games often become the defining features of those games - There's nothing wrong with realizing that outside of very narrow context like simulator physics, people generally don't seek out realism in our entertainment. People want a certain degree of escapism that relies on breaking the rules a little, or in the case of NPCs a lot. reply ahazred8ta 1 hour agorootparentOutlandish but comical quips?

For example in Rainworld, the enemies keep doing their own thing even when you aren't around. This has some gameplay value (makes the game less predictable), but I think the main value is that people talk about it and think it's interesting. So it changes people's perception of the game world in a positive way. reply ryandrake 16 hours agorootparentprev> Anyway, with AI characters, I expect it will actually be more frustrating and boring than not if they have realistic lives and schedules.

I think you misread my posts. We don't have awkward animations because our mocap isn't good enough, we have awkward animations because typical human motion looks awkward - our brains just mostly ignore that. People are awkward; we don't actually want characters in games/movies/etc to be like real people. Very few movies, for example, would be well served by conversations frequently and for non-plot-related reasons being interrupted by loud noises, having people talk over each other and nonverbally try to figure out who gets to speak, having characters ask \"What?\" and then begin to reply without waiting for the answer because their brain caught up half a second later, etc. reply ca_tech 17 hours agoparentprevThere is a delicate balance though. The draw of the RPG is that you play a character who usually has an outsized impact on the world in comparison to most everyone else. If we expect the NPCs to operate as independent entities, how do we manage their ambition so that they don't individually, or in aggregate, impact the world more than you? Without that, your character becomes another cog in the machine; it's their world and you are simply living in it... Which I could see having a certain appeal and may be just another genre. reply ta8645 10 hours agorootparentSome of the most hilarious and enjoyable parts of gaming is manipulating the environment in ways developers didn't anticipate.

All his points are good, they are things you would have to work around in some way. > Then we'll make new kinds of games where the unpredictability of the NPCs is a core mechanic. This is impossible, you need the NPC to be predictable on some level to make a fun game. Even unpredictable NPC needs to have a predictable personality on some level, total randomness isn't fun. Like, imagine a terrain generator that just randomizes terrain on each tile, that wont be fun at all, that is what a basic random personality would be like. Think of a human opponent, they are very predictable, just looking at a human player and what he does and I can predict what he will do in the future. Not perfectly, but players aren't that random. To make an AI that feels good it has to be very predictable. The main problem with \"smart\" bots is that they have so far always been way less predictable than humans, they get a strange edge cases and bugs where they start to act very dumb and strangely, that feels like a bug to the player and isn't fun. Or their smartness makes them do the same thing every time making them even more predictable than basic scripting, either way they are worse than basic scripting.

Right now I'm into games like Factorio and Captain of Industry and they've both recently had blog posts about how they do terrain generation and CoI stuck out because you can manually plop features like mountains and then it procedurally generates the mountain range[1]. There's been a lot of games recently that seem to be doing procedural land generation, is there not a way this can be applied to AI personalities as well or is there no overlap between them?

But people like having other people even if they never really interact, just having others there that you can show what you did to and talk about stuff is fun. But point is, that realization isn't that simple, it took a long time for cooperative games to become common. In early days game consoles had cooperative split screen to let two players play at the same time, not because that was more fun, so it took a really long time for cooperative modes to become standard in online gaming because it wasn't at all obvious that people liked cooperative play. MMORPGs were the main cooperative online games for a long time.

First, each human is kind of a separate universe, another 80 billion neurons to converse with, each with our own histories and vastly different knowledge and experience. In a conversation, we learn a lot from each other, and better understand how we can be different in skills, and even in basic things like emotion, motivation, etc.., better understanding what it means to be a human, and better understanding what it means to be in general. Also, it's very important for us to maintain some kind of social contact (I think written counts as well), because our brains language ability will degrade and we will lose critical skills including reading social cues. Speaking of social cues, interacting with others specially in a complex environment where there can be severe competition as well as cooperation and difficult coordination, is something that also is worth practicing. I have nothing against solo games, but this kind of thing is not practiced in a solo game. Finally, I think other kinds of games (e.g. in competitive games) tend to have very simple interactions and objectives, compared to an MMO: there's a clear objective to win that's shared by everyone. Some MMOs have much more interesting interactions, where each person is interested in a different thing, and I think this contributes to a very rich atmosphere that isn't just 'Go win, try to win match, go out', i.e. more life-analogue (without other limitations of life, like you can't actually die, and being poor isn't as terrible as it often is IRL :( ). reply dreamworld 12 hours agorootparentSo just be more in the real world? (I mean, IRL) Well, yes, but there are advantages to virtual worlds, as long as they're not designed to be simply addictive time sinks. And there are advantages to the real world. The inputs to a computer game are more limited, you can't see people, their faces (and sometimes voices), the graphics are still a far cry from the more beautiful places. Also, real life is full of responsibilities and large parts of it still, well, suck (bad jobs, exploitative practices, etc.). I think we're improving somewhat (greatly hampered by greed and power games). If you have interesting activities IRL, like a great fulfilling job and hobbies (that are also potentially useful in other ways, like charity work), then by all means, but I think virtual worlds have their place in our lives. reply Kerb_ 11 hours agorootparentprev3 hours of gaming alone can be valuable relaxation and entertainment but doing it while voice chatting can be both as well as social engagement. Just because one is more valuable from most perspectives doesn't mean one is a waste and one isn't. You don't need to be in a lobby with friends to enjoy or be good at CS:GO or R6, but I think it makes you more likely to become a better player and cooperate with your teammates if you do, and I think engaging in cooperation in one realm of your life can lead to easier cooperation in other areas. They are both wastes of time from the perspective that you could be building something or doing a creative hobby with an actual output, and they're both effective uses of time from the perspective that recreation and skill are important even if they aren't essential skills. In the end, I think playing MMOs without engaging in the social aspect is a waste and you might as well be playing Cookie Clicker, but that doesn't mean I think MMOs or Cookie Clicker are waste of time in and of themselves. reply alfiedotwtf 15 hours agorootparentprevI’m with Vasco on this one.

In many singleplayer games, you can slide difficulty up or down to change the effort:reward ratio. In an MMORPG, though, you have different groups of players with different amounts of time. You want to make it fun for both the kid on summer vacation who is happy to spend 80 hours a week on a game (not a choice I want for my kid, but I was a kid once too) and an adult who has a 60-hour work week and exchanges 2 hours of sleep after the kids go to bed to play.

So by interface you'd have to mean like, a robotic hand. And if that ever becomes a real problem they add a 3D camera to the controller or require it to be positioned below the screen, and use ML to decide if there's a human in front of the machine or not. AI cuts both ways. Integrated hardware devices aren't necessarily easy to just cut into. That's why it's hard to mod consoles to begin with. reply FrustratedMonky 11 hours agorootparentprevThat is correct. I think what people are missing, is that by the time you build a controller interface, and a screen grabber, and have an AI that can interpret the screen grab, understand and play the game, that this is super incredible, and really the humans are probably already being herded into Soylent Green processing centers to feed the remaining humans that are kept around for maintenance tasks. reply jedberg 11 hours agorootparentI think you're underestimating how easy it is to cut the cord on an Xbox controller and hijack the signals and just plug the HDMI cable into a capture card.

Credit Credit... Kenny Holston/The New York Times By Sapna Maheshwari, David McCabe and Annie Karni March 13, 2024 阅读简体中文版閱讀繁體中文版 The House on Wednesday passed a bill with broad bipartisan support that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner to either sell the hugely popular video app or have it banned in the United States. The move escalates a showdown between Beijing and Washington over the control of a wide range of technologies that could affect national security, free speech and the social media industry. Republican leaders fast-tracked the bill through the House with limited debate, and it passed on a lopsided vote of 352 to 65, reflecting widespread backing for legislation that would take direct aim at China in an election year. The action came despite TikTok’s efforts to mobilize its 170 million U.S. users against the measure, and amid the Biden administration’s push to persuade lawmakers that Chinese ownership of the platform poses grave national security risks to the United States, including the ability to meddle in elections. The result was a bipartisan coalition behind the measure that included Republicans, who defied former President Donald J. Trump in supporting it, and Democrats, who also fell in line behind a bill that President Biden has said he would sign. The bill faces a difficult road to passage in the Senate, where Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, has been noncommittal about bringing it to the floor for a vote and where some lawmakers have vowed to fight it. And even if it passes the Senate and becomes law, it is likely to face legal challenges. But Wednesday’s vote was the first time a measure that could widely ban TikTok for consumers was approved by a full chamber of Congress. The app has been under threat since 2020, with lawmakers increasingly arguing that Beijing’s relationship with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, raises national security risks. The bill is aimed at getting ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese owners within six months. The president would sign off on the sale if it resolved national security concerns. If that sale did not happen, the app would be banned. Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who is among the lawmakers leading the bill, said on the floor before the vote that it “forces TikTok to break up with the Chinese Communist Party.” “This is a common-sense measure to protect our national security,” he said. Image Representative Mike Gallagher, the Wisconsin Republican who is among the lawmakers behind the bill. Credit... Kent Nishimura for The New York Times Alex Haurek, a spokesman for TikTok, said in a statement that the House “process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: It’s a ban.” “We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy — seven million small businesses — and the 170 million Americans who use our service,” he added. On Wednesday, before the House vote, Beijing condemned the push by U.S. lawmakers and rejected the notion that TikTok was a danger to the United States. At a daily press briefing, Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry, accused Washington of “resorting to hegemonic moves when one could not succeed in fair competition.” If the bill were to become law, it would likely deepen a cold war between the United States and China over the control of many important technologies, including solar panels, electric vehicles and semiconductors. Mr. Biden has announced limitations on how U.S. financial firms can invest in Chinese companies and restricted the sale of Americans’ sensitive data like location and health information to data brokers that could sell it to China. Platforms like Facebook and YouTube are blocked in China, and Beijing said last year that it would oppose a sale of TikTok. TikTok has said that it has gone to great lengths to protect U.S. user data and provide third-party oversight of the platform, and that no government can influence the company’s recommendation model. It has also said there is no proof that Beijing has used TikTok to obtain U.S. user data or to influence Americans’ views, two of the concerns lawmakers have cited. In an unusually aggressive move for a technology company, TikTok urged users to call their representatives last week to protest the bill, saying, “This legislation has a predetermined outcome: a total ban of TikTok in the United States.” TikTok has spent more than $1 billion on an extensive plan known as Project Texas that aims to handle sensitive U.S. user data separately from the rest of the company’s operations. That plan has for several years been under review by a panel known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS. Two of the lawmakers behind the bill, Mr. Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, said last week that lawmakers were acting because CFIUS “hasn’t solved the problem.” It’s very unusual for a bill to garner broad bipartisan support but at the same time divide both parties. President Biden has said he would sign the bill into law, but top House leaders like Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, voted against the bill. Mr. Trump said he opposed the bill, but many of his most stalwart allies in the House, like Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, the No. 4 Republican in the House, voted for it. The vote came down to something of a free-for-all, with unusual alliances in support of and opposed to the bill. Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the former house speaker, sat in the chamber nodding along with hard-right Republicans like Representative Dan Crenshaw, Republican of Texas, as they outlined their support for the bill. At one point, she got up and crossed over to the Republican side of the aisle to confer with Representative Chip Roy, a hard-right Republican of Texas, who had vocally supported the bill on the floor. Several Republicans and Democrats expressed their opposition to the bill based on free speech concerns and TikTok’s popularity in the United States. Some legal experts have said that if the bill were to become law, it would probably face First Amendment scrutiny in the courts. Representative Maxwell Frost, a Democrat of Florida, said on Tuesday that “not only am I no, but I’m a hell no.” He said the legislation was an infringement of First Amendment rights. “I hear from students all the time that get their information, the truth of what has happened in this country, from content creators on TikTok.” He said he was concerned about Americans’ data, but “this bill does not fix that problem.” Image Representative Maxwell Frost at a news conference with TikTok creators on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. Credit... Haiyun Jiang for The New York Times There wasn’t any legislation last year in the aftermath of a fiery hearing with Shou Chew, TikTok’s chief executive, despite bipartisan support to regulate the app. But concern among lawmakers has grown even more in recent months, with many of them saying that TikTok’s content recommendations could be used for misinformation, a concern that has escalated in the United States since the Israel-Hamas war began. “It was a lot of things in the interim, including Oct. 7, including the fact that the Osama bin Laden ‘Letter to America’ went viral on TikTok and the platform continued to show dramatic differences in content relative to other social media platforms,” Mr. Krishnamoorthi said in an interview. There’s also a chance that even if the bill is signed and survives court challenges, it could crumble under a new administration. Mr. Trump, who tried to ban TikTok or force its sale in 2020, publicly reversed his position on the app over the past week. In a television appearance on Monday, Mr. Trump said that the app was a national security threat, but that banning it would help Facebook, a platform the former president criticized. “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,” he said. Mr. Trump’s administration had threatened to remove TikTok from American app stores if ByteDance did not sell its share in the app. ByteDance even seemed ready to sell a stake in the app to Walmart and Oracle, where executives were close to Mr. Trump. That plan went awry in federal court. Multiple judges stopped Mr. Trump’s proposed ban from taking effect. Mr. Biden’s administration has tried turning to a legislative solution. The White House provided “technical assistance” to Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Krishnamoorthi as they wrote their bill, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said at a briefing last week. When the bill was introduced, a National Security Council spokesman quickly called the legislation “an important and welcome step to address” the threat of technology that imperils Americans’ sensitive data. The administration has repeatedly sent national security officials to Capitol Hill to privately make the case for the legislation and offer dire warnings on the risks of TikTok’s current ownership. The White House briefed lawmakers before the 50 to 0 committee vote last week that advanced the bill to the full House. On Tuesday, officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Justice Department spoke with lawmakers in a classified briefing about national security concerns tied to TikTok. Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Krishnamoorthi had previously sponsored a bill aimed at banning TikTok. The latest bill has been viewed as something of a last stand against the company for Mr. Gallagher, who recently said he would not run for a fifth term because “the framers intended citizens to serve in Congress for a season and then return to their private lives.” Sapna Maheshwari reports on TikTok, technology and emerging media companies.

Order ReprintsToday’s PaperSubscribe 1186 Share full article 1186 TikTok Under Scrutiny The popular video app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, is under pressure amid concerns over the handling of users’ data. Efforts to Ban TikTok: Over the last year, lawmakers in the United States, Canada and Europe have escalated efforts to restrict access to the app, citing security threats. Here is what to know. In the United States: The House passed a bill with broad bipartisan support that would force TikTok’s Chinese owner to sell its hugely popular video app or be banned in the United States. The move escalates a showdown between Beijing and Washington over the control of technologies that could affect national security, free speech and the social media industry. How TikTok Shares User Data: Internal documents show how TikTok employees have regularly posted user information, including the driver’s licenses of American users, on a messaging and collaboration tool called Lark. First U.S. Ban: In November, a federal judge blocked Montana’s statewide ban of TikTok from taking effect, at least temporarily preventing the nation’s first such prohibition on the app. The Stakes: Even as U.S. officials are focused on the dangers of TikTok, many users disagree with those concerns.

We can make similar arguments about the negative effects of Facebook, Instagram, and etc. even from the POVs of other countries, but the key issue here is that China heavily restricts foreign apps and services from operating in their market. If China is unwilling to allow US companies to compete fairly in their digital ecosystem, why the hell should we continue to grant Chinese firms unrestricted access to our market? reply jrockway 16 hours agoparentI don't think we should \"lowest common denominator\" to oppressive regimes. Our Constitution says \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" TikTok, at the end of the day, is just a kind of printing press. So it should be allowed under the First Amendment. The First Amendment protects pledging your allegiance to the Flag, just as it protects China saying \"China is great, you should love us instead\". The First Amendment makes no attempt to moderate content; you can say pretty much whatever you want. If China's use of TikTok for propaganda upsets you, then it's on you to make a compelling argument that is better than theirs. (I actually don't think that TikTok is much of a Chinese propaganda avenue. People are just mad that it's telling kids to eat tide pods and then they get sick. Who knew that underfunding public education for years would have consequences.) At the end of the day, what this law is asking for is a Great Firewall around the US, that prohibits which websites its citizens can visit. I do not want that, even if China's market practices are unfair. The cure is worse than the disease. reply zachmu 15 hours agorootparentTiktok isn't \"some website\", it is partially owned and controlled by the CCP, which influences what content gets shown to Americans. A majority of zoomers get most of their news and information primarily from this platform, which again is under the influence of a hostile foreign government. (TikTok also spies on US citizens for the CCP, but let's keep this restricted to the free speech argument about the ban). We actually don't have to shrug and say \"oh well, first amendment\" with respect to propaganda outlets of foreign countries. reply throwaway199956 14 hours agorootparentDoesn't first ammendment protect even that.

Can you paint me a picture of a timeline or a series of key turns that would lead to that outcome? reply amou234 11 hours agorootparentAnything's possible I guess, I mean, did anyone expect that China would allow the release of the man made covid virus from its Wuhan biolab (intentionally, or unintentionally) out to the world, killing millions in the process and giving long covid to millions more? And US and UK would be the ones that developed the vaccine successfully, and allowed the rest of the world to fully function after 2 years? And China would be the one that couldn't come up with its own vaccine, and just decided to release it into the wild in 2022 and bury any sort of mention of mass covid deaths [1]? I mean, if it were the other way around, and US and the rest of world was still shut down after 2 years while China was fully functional, TikTok could have been used by China to incite civil unrest in democratic countries, leading some to its downfall. I mean, there's no way China would release a covid 2, right?

It sounds like a specific concern you have and you've given it careful consideration. reply zachmu 14 hours agorootparentprevA US citizen distributing foreign media themselves is quite different than what is effectively a directly controlled broadcast owned by a foreign government. reply brookst 13 hours agorootparentI’m not usually a slippery slope person, but if we’re outlawing content based on who owns the creator or transmitter, things get ugly quick. reply zachmu 13 hours agorootparentIt's not even content per se, it's much more insidious than that. The comment I originally replied to likened tiktok to a printing press, but that's not quite right. Imagine a printing press owned by an enemy that would subtly manipulate the text of whatever you tried to print. Or maybe it would omit entire articles from certain recipients of the newspaper, or reorganize the page layout to emphasize different things than the editor intended. We wouldn't allow this hypothetical printing press controlled by a hostile foreign government to be sold in the US, we would be crazy to. reply brookst 12 hours agorootparentActually, yes, we would allow such a thing. Plenty of our news organizations are foreign – owned, and many of them are very elegant to your hypothetical printing press. The US simply doesn’t have the constitutional or legal framework to regulate content reproduction for ideological reasons. reply true_religion 13 hours agorootparentprevA rule that hostile nations can’t own communication platforms in your country isn’t a slippery slope.

ISIS wouldn't be allowed to own a publishing company in America; nobody thinks that somehow curtails freedom of speech. If somebody so chooses, they could distribute content from ISIS, and restrictions on that would indeed be a restriction on speech. But it wouldn't be a restriction to make it illegal to give money to ISIS. reply chii 7 hours agorootparentthat's because ISIS is a terrorist organization. So if you want to make the same argument, you will have to declare china's CCP to be a terrorist organization - and all of the legal implications that entails. reply mannerheim 4 hours agorootparentThat's not a constitutional requirement. There's no law that says the government can only do this to terrorists. In fact, even if somebody is a terrorist, if they're American, it would still be unconstitutional to deprive their freedom of speech. ByteDance, as a foreign entity, enjoys no such protection. reply throwaway199956 14 hours agorootparentprevListening to foreign radio stations on shortwave and listening their propaganda is also not illegal in the US. reply hayst4ck 12 hours agorootparentprevIs it? When you're saying that, I think you're imagining your neighbor, not your oligarch. When one country tries to cause chaos in another, they use a two pronged approach. (1) they offer a country's aristocracy the ability to enrich themselves at the cost of their people. This could be things like cheap labor, gas pipelines, or being the guarantor of loans. (2) They tell a countries peasantry that the worlds problems are simple and that their government is their enemy and failing them. This is only empowered by having compromised their aristocracy, so their government is failing them. Then they put their fingers on the scale by providing resources (weapons, funding, press, intelligence, etc.) to an aligned entity capable of promoting their interests. It's worth considering that the great firewall of china exists explicitly because the Chinese government (rationally) thinks it's risky to subject people who were subsistence farming a generation ago to foreign influence. The cost of freedom is responsibility, and if you have an irresponsible (read: poorly educated/non critical thinking) populace, then people will unwittingly surrender their freedom. Freedom means the freedom to do the wrong thing, but that can result in bending or breaking. reply cangeroo 14 hours agorootparentprevDo foreign nationals have the same rights as Americans?

In that case, that relevant consideration would seems to be rare broad bipartisan support (as evidenced by a very lopsided 352-65 vote, but we'll see what happens in the Senate) to limit the potential harm that can be done by the information warfare capabilities of a genocidal authoritarian regime with whom it is certainly plausible that the US will be at war with in the next decade.

Some of our oldest and most well supported laws revolve around limiting what a business can and can't say.

For example, the FCC prevents public broadcasters from saying \"fuck\" on the air. Yet you can yell \"Fuck the police\" over and over again and be protected by the first amendment.

There are things they can't say while the stock market is open (such as announcing a merger). Yet an individual has no such restrictions on their free speech. The closest analogy would be preventing individuals from inciting a riot or issuing calls for violence. And that underlines that free speech in the US has limits (and always has). About the only speech that is pretty much fully protected is political speech, but as I said, even that falls a bit short as you can get in hot water if someone uses your political speech as inspiration for violence. reply kirse 15 hours agorootparentprevTikTok, at the end of the day, is just a kind of printing press.

The idea of “rights” expands far beyond that which works well for you and people like you. reply heroprotagonist 8 hours agorootparentprevWe have laws against foreign ownership of broadcast TV and radio. Our legal system already acknowledges that foreign ownership of the media is a bad thing that should be prevented. The problem is that these laws haven't been updated for the modern era. TikTok is not covered. But this due to a failure of our politicians to respond to the modern era, not because the bill of rights enshrines or applies to foreign companies. That's why Rupert Murdoch had to become a US citizen in order to start FOX in the 80s. This then enabled him to build FOX News with the specific intent to become the media arm of the Republican party, by tapping Roger Ailes as the first and guiding CEO. Ailes had already worked on media campaigns for Nixon, Reagan, and Bush, often credited as a major factor in their victories. So he got to run the day to day of the party's new media arm. Murdoch himself was an international operator who wanted political power for the benefits rather than the ideology. This is demonstrated by the much more liberal leanings in Australia when that was the party willing to grant him power. What could the impacts be today, if FOX News was owned by the CCP instead of an Aussie of negotiable political virtue? reply jrockway 8 hours agorootparentThe law in the US is that you can't make radio transmissions on TV / AM / FM frequencies without a license, because left unchecked, everyone doing what they want would make radio useless for everyone. The government has a clear reason to require licenses, and they have the power to restrict who can receive one. The Internet doesn't work like that, though. No license is required to make a website or mobile app, because websites and mobile apps don't interfere with each other. The government wouldn't have a very strong argument to require websites to have a license, because they have no reason for doing that other than in moderating the content of the website, which is prohibited by the Constitution. In the past, TV licenses were absolutely used to censor viewpoints the government didn't like, but now that is no longer possible, because nobody cares about TV or radio. You can bring in whatever content you want from anywhere in the world, thanks to the Internet. That is what the government is salty about; they are losing control because people don't care about TV anymore. (I'll also point out that shortwave radio still exists. You can tune your radio to, say, 5910kHz and listen to CCP propaganda all day, and there is nothing the US government can do about it. On the flip side, we have Voice of America for a reason. We like broadcasting American propaganda into China just as much as China likes the reverse. Unfortunately, nobody listens to shortwave radio anymore. That's what the US is mad about; people like TikTok, but they don't have anything like it.) reply heroprotagonist 5 hours agorootparentI was referring to the section of the Telecommunication Act that limits foreign direct investment to a 20% ownership stake (which ups to 25% with FCC approval for anything more if a holding company is used). I'm not sure I communicated my point clearly though, because I agree that the old laws do not apply because they haven't been updated to work with the internet era. I do know how the internet works, though, and that you can get data from 'anywhere'. Nobody would really care about the issue, though, if there weren't ways to make it more difficult to operate. Banning from the app stores doesn't prevent people from watching TikTok, but it makes it more difficult. They'll get fewer users if they need to side-load a native app or use a PWA, and a significant revenue dip from blocked advertising from PWA or browser views. This gives competitors an artificial advantage that network effects can solidify in time. But the point I was trying to make is, the US should address their failure to keep legislation up-to-date with national security objectives, rather than single out a single company. Rather than stick-up jobs on random international corporations, eg 'Sell to our country, OR ELSE', they should have created legislation with privacy laws that apply Congress' concerns to all companies, perhaps with stricter rules for international companies. A review process and penalties could result in forced removal from the app store. This could have _prevented_ TikTok's data collection by defining a clear line they're not allowed to cross. And if they still crossed the line, their app could be removed without it clearly being biased. Now, the stated concern (privacy violations and data transferred to China) are likely not the only problem. We would have to update the old laws and go beyond simply checking for foreign ownership. The law would need to directly address the same issue that the old law was written for (potential abuse by a foreign entity). The privacy laws would need to be there. But we'd need to also build a process enabling review of algorithmic behavior and manual processes around censorship and propaganda, when companies reach a certain size or market reach. We'd need safeguards to prevent abuse of the law (which will happen, considering the tendency for all of our institutions to come under regulatory capture at some point). Frankly, I'd prefer if algorithmic ranking system were forced to be opened to the public in a scenario where they gain sufficient audience to cause a significant impact on public discourse, as long as we're rewriting the laws. Some might cringe and cry 'Oh no, what about the intellectual property of that dozen or so megacorps!' And no doubt these companies would also incur expense fighting the gamification of their algorithms. That's just the cost of being so impactful, and it will drive innovation if they can't keep up. And it's the best way to ensure abuses are discovered if we put regulation of censorship and algorithmic abuse in the hands of government organizations. Basically, we need a framework to systemically address these issues. Not repeated contentious multi-year congressional fights that are triggered on a case-by-case basis. The current haphazard approach _might_ succeed against an occasional bad actor, but it's going to let dozens more through. All they're doing now is generating talking points during an election year. It's political theatre, not problem-solving. reply maybelsyrup 14 hours agorootparentprev> People are just mad that it's telling kids to eat tide pods and then they get sick.

It's the worst system out there, except for all the others. People not understanding their government is the deeper problem. Does banning TikTok fix this problem? It sounds like we're saying \"only opinion columnists who work for The New York Times and Fox News should be able to tell you how to vote and what issues you care about\". That's really not great either, is it? It's really depressing watching the government strip away the rights of women and transgender people. We can't blame social media influence bots for that.

I agree with the rest of your premises, but the above should be a separate issue from them. reply wdh505 14 hours agorootparentprevI'll try to weigh in. Democratic republics like the USA are heavily swayed by people, protests, etc. In the digital age, just-in-time censorship of social media like Facebook or Twitter have been extremely effective at preventing \"good/bad\" protests, and each government sets the rules for the social media in the country (read easy censorship). Additionally, there have been a number of international propaganda campaigns that were successful to disrupt regular elections in the USA recently. See evidence of certain protests getting huge right before and during the russo-ukrainian conflict and covid shutdowns. Tik tok the platform's users generally contribute and consume as a \"community that generates content in good faith\" (I use that definition loosely), but it is a arm of soft CCP power that could just-in-time promote something terrible (brainstorming here: cultivate civil-war-esque mindsets then trigger, convince the population to avoid polio vaccines, etc.) Elections are tumultuous enough without having each \"town square\" potentially weaponized by potentially hostile nations, so requiring that free press be free from foreign control (influence is okay under free speech) is what is being decided here. reply paganel 14 hours agorootparentprevIf American democracy goes down because of \"foreign influencers\" from platforms like TikTok then it means that it wasn't all that strong to begin with. reply cutemonster 10 hours agorootparentI don't think there's any country that can withstand someone having direct access to manipulate more than half of the population reply paganel 18 minutes agorootparentI stand by my point, if half of the population can be ideologically \"switched\"/manipulated by a smartphone app then the original ideology (I would assume liberal-democracy in the case of US) wasn't that heavily implanted to begin with.

Hence why I didn't claim it to be universally optimal. All I'm saying is that your willingness to defect against defectors should always be non-zero, just to keep the players in line who start out with a higher predisposition towards defecting. The noisiness of the real world should probably bias us more in the direction of cooperation, to avoid a cascade of defection as you mention, but a player who only cooperates will get taken advantage of regardless of the precise details of the game.

Does the US benefit from the ability to arbitrarily declare companies to be \"foreign adversaries\" and shut them down or force their owners to divest?

In Africa, it's a similar situation - we poured in boatloads of money and aid, in exchange for the demand of a bare minimum of human rights, and now a lot of the countries there are falling to the lure of Russia and China.

If they decided to censor and follow the laws of China they would be allowed to operate there. Google tried to reenter the Chinese market but decided not to after an uproar from its own employees who didn't want to censor. Microsoft is allowed to provide hotmail and bing, etc. services there, because they decided to censor. The problem is exactly what law has tiktok broken in the US?

Sure, but in an act og completely understandable and justafiable reciprocality I guess we should soon see China passing laws to force Microsoft to divest from their American owners or be banned in China.

American social media giants thought it was too damaging to follow Chinese law and voluntarily retreated (Google), played the game until they got burned (Facebook) or silently comply (Bing/Microsoft). In the case of Facebook, they didn't want to share data on Uighur separatists, who organized protests on Facebook, which in turn left hundreds of people dead. Barring any kind of moral judgment, this obviously wouldn't fly in the US either. No, at the core of this issue is the realisation that a social media giant has enormous influence on the minds of the next generation, and having this be in the hands of foreign powers is very dangerous. Of course, the US doesn't want to be super open about this, since 4/5 global players in social media are American, and they'd rather not have other regions get similar thoughts. In the end, the reasoning is sound while the justification is hypocritical. reply IncreasePosts 13 hours agorootparentWell, fine. But now the American law TikTok needs to follow (assuming it is passed by the senate and signed by POTUS) is that the US TikTok needs to be sold, or become unavailable in app stores. reply chaostheory 13 hours agorootparentprevGoogle tried to follow the law, but how can they comply when CCP laws mercurial & vague which is the opposite of EU & US law?

Reciprocity of policies isn't really conceptually coherent. There was some semi-recent news (really, not that recent) to the effect that Saudi Arabia would allow women to drive. Now imagine our policy toward them before they made that change. We could ignore them because they have their own country. Or we could give up on that and try to impose some kind of penalty on them. But one thing you're unlikely to see an argument for is reciprocity. \"So, they don't let their women drive? How barbaric! We'll show them -- we won't let our women drive either!\" reply mempko 13 hours agoparentprevBecause economists would have to acknowledge that protected and restricted markets are better for developing local industry than open markets. Which of course is true. But then they would have to acknowledge the whole neo-liberal experiment of open global markets is bad for us. It would also pave the way for foreign markets to follow in our footsteps and restrict google, facebook, and others, further segregating our digital spaces. reply xdennis 16 hours agoparentprev> I think the primary argument for banning TikTok should be based on reciprocity rather than moral and/or security concerns. The argument that CCP people make is that Facebook et al aren't banned, they just need to follow the law to be allowed.

Banning TikTok is not impinging on free speech. People are still free to say whatever they want on so many (unrestricted) platforms. If someone makes a video of a TikTok video and shares it on Youtube/Whatsapp, that's legal. The actual content is legal, so it's not a free speech/censorship issue. This is the equivalent of \"We've put sanctions on China. You can write whatever you want, as long as you don't do it using Chinese pens and Chinese paper\" It's not at all unusual for countries (including the US) to restrict commerce with a country if they believe the other country isn't engaging in fair commerce. reply pksebben 15 hours agorootparentWhat I find troubling about this is the delta between the vox populi and the decision made. Whether it's right or prudent or whatever, if you figure that people using the service don't want it shut down (~170M or roughly half of the population) then what's happening here is that our \"representatives\" are doing what they always do and totally ignoring their constituency. Mind you, this isn't surprising in the least, but perhaps it's a good moment to step back and reflect a little on this snag in our governance. reply hellotomyrars 12 hours agorootparentI think a lot of this is the language used in reporting around it. It is presented as a Ban on Tiktok in headlines and people who regurgitate them when the purpose of the legislation is not to ban Tiktok but require them to sell their American operations to a domestic company.

Learn from a real LLM Spreadsheets-are-all-you-need implements the forward pass of GPT2 (an ancestor of ChatGPT that was state of the art only a few years ago) entirely in Excel using standard spreadsheet functions. This same Transformer architecture is the foundation for OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Bard/Gemini, Meta’s Llama, and many other LLMs. Yesterday I knew nothing about how AI works.

Lesson 1: Demystifying GPT with Excel In this 10-minute video we kick things off by walking through the high-level architecture of GPT-2 and witnessing each phase of the Transformer come to life in an Excel spreadsheet. Lesson 2: Byte Pair Encoding & Tokenization In this lesson we dive into the first phase of GPT, the tokenization phase and the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm used in models like ChatGPT. We cover Detailed walkthrough of the BPE algorithm, including its learning phase and application in language data tokenization. Spreadsheet Simulation: A hands-on demonstration of the GPT-2’s tokenization process via a spreadsheet model. Limitations and Alternatives: Discussion on the challenges of BPE and a look at other tokenization methods. Extra: An end-to-end walk through of the Excel sheet This is a high level walk through of the Excel implementation. It is primarily geared to those who already understand Transformers and want to know how the standard architecture is mapped to the spreadsheet. Try it yourself Downloading The sheet is available as an xlsb (Excel binary) file in the Releases section of the github repo. You should be able to download and run this file in Excel for Mac or PC. Using If you’re quickly trying to orient yourself to the spreadsheet this walk through video may be helpful though it is not oriented to beginners. For beginners, it’s recommended to start with the lesson videos. Please realize the implementation is just enough to run very small workloads: Full GPT2 small (124M parameters) model including byte pair encoding, embeddings, multi-headed attention, and multi-layer perceptron stages Inference/forward pass only (no training) Context is limited to 10 tokens in length 10 characters per word limit Zero temperature output only This sheet is very big. Unfortunately, it is not unusual for Excel to lock up (but only on a Mac) while using this spreadsheet. It is highly recommended to use the manual calculation mode in Excel and the Windows version of Excel (either on a Windows directory or via Parallels on a Mac). Issues Bugs are not out of the question. Please file issues on Github Contact @ianand on Twitter ianand/spreadsheets-are-all-you-need on Github FAQ What about Google Sheets? This project actually started on Google Sheets but the full 124M model was too big and switched to Excel. I’m still exploring ways to make this work in Google Sheets but it is unlikely to fit into a single file as it can with Excel. Why can’t I chat with it like ChatGPT? It doesn’t match the output of ChatGPT? Aside from the minuscule context length, it also lacks the instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) that turn a large language model into a chatbot.

Always looking to improve it. To answer your question: EECS Major in college; 20 years of engineering and product management experience. I have given a few technical talks at conferences and I do enjoy the process of explaining things though it takes a surprising amount of work. When I went to school ironically neural nets were the one thing they didn't cover in the intro to AI courses. I've basically learned modern AI from just filling my own curiosity over the years through online resources on nights and weekends. Learned a lot from Jeremy Howard's Fast.ai and Andrej Karpathy's stuff just like everyone else. I really wanted to know how every step of GPT worked, kind of like how you learn Computer Architecture in college: you learn how CPUs work in principle starting with circuits. Then I got a crazy idea the whole model could fit in a spreadsheet because well I just really like spreadsheets. Went down a 2-3 month rabbit hole in my non-existent sparetime to make it work. reply anhner 59 minutes agorootparentThe passion and curiosity you have for the topic are palpable in the videos.

I hung out with a friend while they solved Advent of Code challenges in Excel, that was a trip to watch. reply makeitdouble 1 hour agoparentI wonder at what point we stop calling them \"spreadsheets\" though. You mention Excel, and a bunch of us do it Google Sheets, but at this point it's not about sheets of data anymore and more about the interface and runtime, and we have full applications running in it. I remember a colleague running API tests inside his Excel sheet to more easily check for the different parameter combinations, but telling everyone he was still using Postman just to avoid discussing it. reply thelittleone 55 minutes agorootparentI think it still becomes about the data. If using a sheet as an app particularly with sharepoint, data integrity and merging multiple users often becomes a problem. I run one for a financial services firm and often get \"excel couldnt merge changes, want to save a copy or discard\". We tested this out, 2 users make editing different sheets on a single excel workbook hosted on sharepoint and excel can't figure out how to merge. If someone is on VPN and connection drops this also often occurs. reply wil421 27 minutes agorootparentprevYou can feed postman a CSV to test parameters with.

This starts kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines. The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole, asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem. Ingenious! The Wikipedia page about wire photos is worth a read — French designers argued that the technology was responsible for an early form of fast fashion. After World War II at haute couture shows in Paris, Frederick L. Milton would sketch runway designs and transmit his sketches via Bélinographe to his subscribers, who could then copy Parisian fashions. In 1955, four major French couturiers (Lanvin, Dior, Patou, and Jacques Fath) sued Milton for piracy, and the case went to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. Wirephoto enabled a speed of transmission that the French designers argued damaged their businesses.

I remember working at a little paper in South Carolina when AP rolled out an early way to see photos on a computer screen instead of waiting for the wacky old spinning drum machines to spit out prints, one by one, that you'd physically thumb through.

And the they take their time to convey the message. I wonder what happened? I have been blown away by some of the older explainer videos from the 40s and 50s, esp. some of the military training videos for vehicle repair, electrical engineering, etc. Very concise and very clear explanations, always with visual examples. Today, we have things like 3brown1blue that are kind of like that, but in general you don't see information transfer like this either online or in school (at least not in my experience). reply BurningFrog 14 hours agorootparentMy guess is that back then producing films was expensive cutting edge technology, and the few films that got made hired the brightest and best, and gave them time to get it right.

The problem is that libraries Dewey decimals are managed by librarians who want to sort things correctly. YouTube would be managed by uploaders who wants their stuff to be managed _incorrectly_. YouTube recommendations and search is a super interesting problem not just because of the scale but also because uploaders are an adverse opponent, trying to keyword stuff their spam. reply waterheater 5 hours agorootparentThe obvious solution is to actually have librarians correctly classify the videos. DDS focuses on the nature of the work itself, not on the keywords or spam in the content. Librarians understand how to class all kinds of works, and it should be relatively simple to build a DDS/MDS index (Melville Decimal System since it's open, see https://librarything.com/mds) for YouTube videos. Just like with books, disagreement on classification is inevitable and perfectly natural; there's no perfect classification scheme, though DDS/MDS does a generally good job. reply ghaff 4 hours agorootparentDewey Decimal is probably not actually appropriate but it would be nice to have a good and appropriate classification scheme be used. reply wodenokoto 3 hours agorootparentprev> The obvious solution is to actually have librarians correctly classify the videos Which videos?

This includes unclassified material, though I don't know how you'd find it as a civilian if, for whatever reason, you were interested in learning how to perform maintenance on a modern humvee or what not. The technical manuals are all available through Army epubs, but even though they're not classified, you still need a common access card to login and use the site.

A popular YouTuber mentioned on HN, and deservedly so, is Ben Eater. His series on building a 6502 computer on a breadboard is exactly the kind of blueprint-driven content I would like to see more of.

I used to think that advancing media formats and productions tools would generally make conveying knowledge faster, better and deeper. Instead, we see most media intentionally engaging in overall 'dumbification'. It's not just more content being shorter or more summarized, as I'm trying to compare 'apples to apples' here in terms of content targeting, length etc. reply Narkov 11 hours agorootparentDoes survivor bias account for this? Only the best/most worthwhile videos from the \"old times\" are archived. Right now, we see every piece of crap uploaded to YouTube. No doubt there's awesome video content being created today - Smarter Every Day by Destin Sandlin seems to fit - but it's surrounded by junk. reply AlotOfReading 7 hours agorootparentNo, almost every piece of non-live media that was produced from the 1940s onwards went into huge broadcast archives. Some of the media it was stored on was destroyed, or otherwise reused for newer broadcasts, but much of what survived wasn't due to the inherent quality of the content and we have vast amounts of it remaining. Take this compilation of 1960s commercials from the Prelinger archives [0]. These obviously weren't produced to the same quality as the Chevrolet videos, but it's also not drastically different from contemporaneous syndicated content. The pacing is slower than modern ads, most include practical demonstrations of why the product is better/necessary, and there's just less optimization towards the visual frenzy we see today.

I just wonder if then it’s simply a matter of more creators competing for less ad-money-per-person, which leads to the kind of “optimized” content we see today. reply Swizec 10 hours agorootparentIt’s the algorithm.

I have found so many great videos for woodworking, coffee (both roasting and espresso brewing), robotics, home construction, car repairs, computer/portable device repairs, etc. Youtube has made almost any hands-on activity so much easier for me to learn. I prefer reading for theoretical concepts most of the time, but something more complex that I don't have the time to properly study is sometimes better served by a good video or series as well. Practically, most everything I dig into it's using both, although I just now started using phind.com (thanks for the tip HN) to fill in some of the things all my sources seemed to be skipping over or presupposing, and that has helped me get answers to latent questions I had for quite some time. I really need those links out because I can't rely on AI generated information otherwise, of course. reply lysis 6 hours agoparentprevThe pedagogical level and the production values both have the same source - this is an advertisement. The Jam Handy Organization made what we would now call sponsored content. It is unfair to compare the production values of this to modern educational content or modern amateur content - they're operating at different scales and with different resources. In the past - as in now - media production is driven by the demands of capital. We can wax nostalgic for commercials all we want but comparing it to a different modern product does a disservice to the past and media workers in the present. https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt45kdjb.16 reply Animats 14 hours agoparentprevThe hard part was synchronization. We're used to synchronization being easy today, but it was really hard to synchronize anything until the 1980s, when phase-locked loops became easy and cheap. reply jnewkirk 12 hours agorootparentI had a pair of these transceivers when I was in my teens, from a somewhat later period, thanks to my grandfather who refurbished them from his time as a telegrapher at Western Union. Synchronization at startup took ten seconds or so while each unit adjusted its timing and apparently sent a correction signal to the other, drums whirling all the time and gradually matching initial positions. It looked like the most primitive process possible, but worked every time. reply rightbyte 14 hours agorootparentprevDoes the belinograph need syncing though? I imagine you would just have a waste ribbon around the photo and start it after the call with say a delay you both agreed too. Or maybe you could send light in some known pattern with a starter strip and the receiver could look at the lamp. Attenuation most have been a problem though? I guess you could send some sort of calibration photo to adjust gain? I don't think practical FM signal modulation was a thing yet in the 30s? reply barrkel 11 hours agorootparentYou need to synchronize the spin rate of the drums on either end. If there's a difference of half a rotation over however many hundreds (thousands?) of rotations to transmit the photo, you'd end up with a completely distorted picture. reply barrkel 11 hours agorootparentprevYes, I was looking for the bit where they addressed skew. You can even see it in the demo with the string, horizontal lines come out wavy after transfer to the other spool due to small differences in synchronization. reply Animats 14 hours agoparentprevThat's Jam Handy.

Microwave trucks excluded. I ask this because I swear, as a kid, I’ve seen a cameramen open up a telecom/telephone box and connect something to it. I assumed it was for an uplink back to the station to transmit video. reply lebuffon 16 hours agoparentAbsolutely. From the advent of radio broadcasting telephone lines were used for everything, audio and even DC signalling to control relays. All remote radio broadcasts used at least two lines. One for sending sound back to the station and a 2nd pair (telephone lines are a balanced pair of wires) for \"cue\" that came from the master control room to the remote site. Since most transmitters were located outside of city limits, equalized telephone lines were used to send the sound from master control to the transmitter. This was the most common and cheapest way to make the connection to the transmitter until the advent of inexpensive microwave equipment. And microwave links have a nasty habit of fading out during tropospheric inversions so they were actually not as reliable, over long distances, as a phone line with a backup phone line that took an alternate path. (first hand experience here. Ya I'm that old) :-) Most people today have no idea how you transmit analogue audio faithfully and reliably over long distances, via wires. Telephone engineers figured it out over 100 years ago. reply riffic 15 hours agorootparentthey would have had the operator reverse the charges I assume? by the way the old bell system technical journals are a fun read and are generally available at places like archive.org reply lebuffon 5 hours agorootparentThese were called \"leased\" lines.

Was the quality of audio for remote broadcasts better than a typical phone call? reply lebuffon 5 hours agorootparentYes. The audio quality of land line phones was dictated primarily by transducers. This was by design. The TIA published specs for USA, Canada had their own as well as most other countries. The response of a twisted pair was pretty good over 2 to 4 miles as I recall but for a audio grade (50Hz to 5000Hz) various techniques were used that at the simplest involved coils but there were also active equalizers available for long haul circuits and/or \"hi-fi\" requirements. Remember DSL lines were/are shipping 1..2Mhz carriers over those same old telco lines. :-) Of course some old trunk lines used paper insulation. Really. Which meant noise went up ... when it rained. reply subpixel 15 hours agoparentprevThis is also how live radio broadcasts were made. I'm old enough to have been a part of shows performed at the West End, mixed across the street in the studio, and broadcast from the World Trade Center downtown. reply ikiris 15 hours agoparentprevI know ISDN was used for this kind of thing for a good while. reply lebuffon 15 hours agorootparentYes, ISDN was the higher priced product offered by the telcos but ISDN was not available until the 1980s.

The over the top and increasingly forced devices used to essentially manipulate the viewer, lest there's any ambiguity as to what they \"should\" be feeling.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/flox/flox",
    "originBody": "Hey HN,I&#x27;m Ron Efroni, CEO at Flox, and today we are releasing version 1.0 of our open source CLI, helping folks manage development environments everywhere.My own experience with development environments began with air-gapped systems, having to actually burn software to a CD to iterate over a very slow and expensive development cycle, sometimes reaching the server rack and realizing I have the wrong disk.... Fast forward to today and there are countless alternatives available backed by incredible compute resources, yet we somehow still find ourselves paying the price of long development cycles. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been working for over a decade to simplify the development stack so we can spend more time on making 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s do magical things, and why my co-founder Michael and I started Flox to bring you the solution based on Nix. Today is just the first step on that journey. We hope you&#x27;ll take a peek at our new release, and very much look forward to continuing the journey with you from here together!Introducing Flox 1.0Flox is a platform that lets developers and operators focus on building fast with reproducible environments that span the enterprise SDLC. Using a declarative framework based on Nix, a package management and configuration tool, Flox allows developers to create environments that contain everything they need to build software.Why Flox?Flox behaves a lot like your favorite and familiar package manager, but it allows you to create as many environments as you want on your machine. Each one can contain a different combination of packages.Environments are portable by default. If you install a package inside one that isn&#x27;t cross-platform, it&#x27;s easy to carve out exceptions. It&#x27;s also easy to write hooks and populate your environment with variables - we designed it to be hackable.Flox environments run in user-space, like, where you are.

    "commentBody": "Flox 1.0 – Open-source dev env as code with Nix (github.com/flox)349 points by ronef 18 hours agohidepastfavorite165 comments Hey HN, I'm Ron Efroni, CEO at Flox, and today we are releasing version 1.0 of our open source CLI, helping folks manage development environments everywhere.My own experience with development environments began with air-gapped systems, having to actually burn software to a CD to iterate over a very slow and expensive development cycle, sometimes reaching the server rack and realizing I have the wrong disk.... Fast forward to today and there are countless alternatives available backed by incredible compute resources, yet we somehow still find ourselves paying the price of long development cycles. That's why I've been working for over a decade to simplify the development stack so we can spend more time on making 1's and 0's do magical things, and why my co-founder Michael and I started Flox to bring you the solution based on Nix. Today is just the first step on that journey. We hope you'll take a peek at our new release, and very much look forward to continuing the journey with you from here together! Introducing Flox 1.0 Flox is a platform that lets developers and operators focus on building fast with reproducible environments that span the enterprise SDLC. Using a declarative framework based on Nix, a package management and configuration tool, Flox allows developers to create environments that contain everything they need to build software. Why Flox? Flox behaves a lot like your favorite and familiar package manager, but it allows you to create as many environments as you want on your machine. Each one can contain a different combination of packages. Environments are portable by default. If you install a package inside one that isn't cross-platform, it's easy to carve out exceptions. It's also easy to write hooks and populate your environment with variables - we designed it to be hackable. Flox environments run in user-space, like, where you are. When you type `ls` after activating a Flox environment you will see the same stuff because you're in the same place - even with all those new packages available. No mounting volumes, no proxying ports. No breaking into the toolset you just conjured. Getting Started: No sign-ups, just one install away. Dive into our GitHub repository (https://github.com/flox/flox) and start exploring I’m around all day to answer questions, talk Nix, or just reminisce about simpler times ;). Lots of open source love, Ron peter_l_downs 16 hours agoHi Ron, congratulations on the release. My question is: how will you make money? I see you are the CEO, there is a company, and you have employees. Crunchbase links to news articles that make it seem like you've raised $24MM. Maybe I'm just missing it, but I can't see any pricing information on your landing page or in your docs. After I log in to FloxHub with my Github profile, I don't see any billing options. What is your plan? reply ronef 16 hours agoparentAppreciate the call out. Regarding pricing, bringing forward what you saw today for free and open source, was a major part of why I started Flox, with much more to come into it. What we released today will be free forever (both the open source client and the FloxHub services for sharing environments). We plan on expanding the offering to include a more robust private software catalogs that layers on top of the OOTB Flox Catalog that ships with Flox. If you are interested in publishing your output or need revised versions of open source packages in Flox then it'll be very easy to have your own catalog to compliment the always-free Flox Catalog that Flox ships with today. Beyond that, we are focused on a number of services that help bring Nix's build to the enterprise. Over time we intend to sell a solution to enterprises - through subscriptions and services - so they can more effectively manage expansive and fragmented software supply chains. As part of developing custom tooling for enterprises, we think it's reasonable for them to participate in funding for that work. reply peter_l_downs 15 hours agorootparentThank you for the answer. Best of luck to you and your investors! reply IshKebab 13 hours agorootparentprevGood luck! My experience of Nix, and similar \"robust engineering\" solutions like Bazel is that there are a handful of people that get it, and see the benefits. But there are hoards more that think you should just write hacky shell scripts and bugs don't really matter anyway. reply elbear 40 minutes agorootparentThere are also the people who get it and see the benefits, but don't want to put up with the work required to have your system or environment managed with Nix. If this tool simplifies things, it could get traction. reply yencabulator 8 hours agoparentprev> Crunchbase links to news articles that make it seem like you've raised $24MM. Oh wow. I really don't see a way to a $2.4B exit here. Good luck! reply jahsome 14 hours agoprevThe line about nix making it easier for newcomers in the readme and similar statements always trigger me. I am quite a competent person and I've never once thought \"that was easy\" when trying to use nix. I adore the concepts of nix, but the user experience is awful. Maybe that's what this tool solves? It takes a frustrating amount of effort and incessant config tweaking with little to no documentation and navigating seemingly endless already-deprecated methodologies to reach that point. Perhaps I'm just dumb, or looking in the wrong places. In any case in my experience the end result is every time I see something related to nix, I find myself thinking \"I can't wait til that's easy\" reply paulhilbert 13 hours agoparent\"Flox began its life during the deployment of Nix at the D. E. Shaw group, where it quickly proved invaluable by making Nix easier for newcomers\". Is that the line you are referring to? Sounds like the opposite of what you suggests it says. reply jahsome 7 hours agorootparentThe line suggests the opposite yes. That's why I take issue with it. There's nothing easy about nix. Maybe flox makes it easier, but I am so burned out by screwing around for countless hours with nix I'm not even going to try to figure out if it's true. reply bitvoid 5 hours agorootparentI'm confused here. That quote clearly says that Flox makes Nix easier for newcomers, not that Nix is easy. What exactly do you take issue with? reply jahsome 4 hours agorootparentThe fact that my experience with nix has historically been _so_ difficult, I fear even something that claims to make it \"easier\" will not be able to deliver -- my aversion has everything to do with nix, and little do with any product which claims to improve it. Consider it guilt by association. For me, it doesn't simply need to be easier, it needs to be usable. I lack confidence a product which is an abstraction layer is going to solve that for me, because I have a personal inability to understand the underlying system. reply emptysongglass 3 hours agorootparentMaybe you need to try it out rather than casting doubts about a product you haven't tried yet? Pre-emptively doubting claims based on your past experience with a tool Flox claims to solve seems like a poor way to go here. For what it's worth, there are a number of options in the Nix space that really do solve for its complexity like Devbox and now Flox. reply aidenn0 13 hours agoparentprevI read that as Flox makes nix easier for newcomers, not that nix is easy for newcomers. reply jaxr 13 hours agoparentprevExact same experience here. Been fiddling with nixos for quite a while, but never got comfortable with .nix or flakes. The base concepts keep escaping my mind, I have to revisit every time I have to configure something new and I just got tired. Issues are difficult to debug and you have to go through very specific commands and a hellish filesystem to understand what's going wrong. I love the concept, but I feel like it just gets too much in my way. reply SkyMarshal 13 hours agorootparent> and a hellish filesystem What do you mean by this part? The actual filesystem like Ext4/ZFS/etc? Or the removal of the unix Filesystem Heirarchy and replacement with a simulated/softlinked version in Nix/OS? reply tmountain 14 hours agoparentprevI love nix and have contributed quite a few packages to the nix repository, and I will vouch that it’s anything but easy. I have a background in Haskell which makes it more familiar, but even the syntax is counterintuitive to newcomers. reply xedrac 6 hours agorootparentThis is my experience too. At scale, I find Nix to be really slow, and the remote building infrastructure over VPN to be very flakey (see what I did there?). But it does solve some tough problems, and also introduces some new ones. Nix is incredibly useful, and extremely frustrating at the same time. Also, disk space... reply phero_cnstrcts 10 hours agoparentprevI think once somebody solves the hellish configuration with another language that people can actually understand NixOs will take off. I mean, I hate js as much as everybody else, but I’d rather use that to configure nix than whatever that thing is that they use now. reply stevefolta 5 hours agorootparentThe language isn't the problem, it's the structure (if you can call it that) of Nixpkgs that makes it so difficult. And no, flakes are not the answer, they may solve composability but they create other problems. reply rjblackman 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is garn a typescript frontend to the nix language. https://github.com/garnix-io/garn/ reply rochak 12 hours agoparentprevHard agree. I see the advantages but the initial learning curve is incredibly steep. Funny how this mimics my experience with Rust. reply rapnie 13 hours agoparentprevAgreed on the experience, hard to onboard. I looked at devenv.sh as easier way to get going. Implemented all with Nix, less lock-in. Just found std [0] and that looks quite promising too. [0] https://std.divnix.com/ reply whateveracct 8 hours agoparentprevI used the repl from day 1 and it was so intuitive. No other alternative has a repl (besides guix I guess) reply solatic 15 hours agoprevOne critical issue with \"power of Nix without the learning curve\" kind of products is that you still have Nix behind the scenes, including the /nix/store, which is intentionally not cleaned up by Nix automatically. So when users try out something that hides Nix from them, their drives inevitably fill up, which is super user-friendly because they have no idea how to reduce the amount of storage used. It's different when users understand that they're installing Nix, and go through the learning curve, because that learning curve helps them to build the mental model of what /nix/store is and how to maintain it. What's your strategy for dealing with the underlying complexities? reply tomberek 15 hours agoparentSupporting rollback and history means disks can fill up. With Nix, this is usually due to a bunch of GC roots pointing to profiles and packages that then cannot be cleaned up. Our environments are not just symlinks, but have a declarative format (under the hood, flakes) so one can remove them, but also reproduce them as needed. So GC'ing them is less destructive than with using `nix-env`/`nix profile`. This allows us to be more aggressive in cleaning up old generations. So the strategy is to ensure there is always a declarative+reproducible way to recover the things you clean up, then we can apply various heuristics to avoid disks from filling up; free space, age, least-recently-used, least-frequently-used - are all being considered. reply xyzzy_plugh 14 hours agoparentprevAs opposed to Docker, or Bazel? Conversely I have never had this problem with Nix. It tells you plainly how to clean up garbage. It's easy to interrogate to find out what's hanging around, and why. The reason it's not on by default is that, like any garbage collector, it can be disruptive -- there is no \"one size fits all\" policy. Ultimately if you have too many gc roots you have to make some decisions. reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparentThe problem (especially pre-flakes) with nix (and Docker too; haven't used Bazel) is that if you GC, you can't recreate your previous environment (which version of nixpkgs were you using when you built it/which day did you run apt-get update in your Dockerfile). It appears that Flox uses flakes and versions the flake.lock file, so it should be possible to readily reproduce anything that hasn't completely disappeared from the internet. reply OJFord 42 minutes agorootparentCan't you just pin pkgs to particular commit, so everything will have the version it did as of that commit? reply Cyph0n 12 hours agorootparentprevTrue, but with Flakes, as long as you didn’t upddate your lock file, you should always be able to rollback to your previous environment. On NixOS, you can then configure background GC to clean up the Nix store periodically: https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=23.11&from=0&size=5... reply emptysea 15 hours agoparentprevWe have the same problem with bazel at work, after a few months your machine is running out of disk space reply dieortin 15 hours agorootparentLuckily a feature to limit the disk cache size is in development: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/5139 reply colordrops 15 hours agoparentprevNix supports garbage collection. Also there are literally thousands of insanely complex things happening behind the scenes every time you use your computer. Not sure why Nix is considered special when abstracting over it. reply anon291 15 hours agoparentprevJust set nix garbage collect to run every thirty minutes. reply pasc1878 14 hours agorootparentThe point being asked was how do you do the gc using flex, as the aim is to not have to go inti nix reply Cu3PO42 16 hours agoprevCongrats on the launch! I love Nix. I really do. I also recognize the onboarding experience is bad at best and terrible at worst. As such I welcome any effort to make it more approachable. I believe the imperative CLI is a great step in that direction. It's much closer to what many people expect and will feel comfortable with. Simplifying the \"using an environment from somewhere else\" story is also one I strongly relate to. One thing I'm not seeing that I think would be important is IDE integration. Starting your IDE from the command line inside the environment is not intuitive to many of my colleagues and is something I've diagnodes as the root cause of an issue more than once. What's your story for dropping down into 'real Nix' if required? I'm a bit afraid that this might drop you off at a cliff for somewhat more complicated environments, for example to set up a cross-compilation Rust toolchain. To stick with the example of Rust development, I have the following shellHook in one of my Flakes: export LIBCLANG_PATH=\"${pkgs.llvmPackages.libclang.lib}/lib\" export RUST_SRC_PATH=\"${pkgs.rust.packages.stable.rustPlatform.rustLibSrc}\" export BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS=\"$( What's your story for dropping down into 'real Nix' if required? We already have talked about this and plan to allow using Nix itself in those cases where someone needs the additional power. The current thought is to have allow a either a reference to a flake for specific fields or to have an Nix-style entrypoint. This is not yet exposed or documented. Stay tuned. aside: absolutely agree that there is a fine line between hiding complexity and exposing power reply ivanjermakov 17 hours agoprevWhat is the benefit of using Flox over plain nix-shell or nix develop? reply mkenigs 16 hours agoparentFlox employee here! To start off by addressing how this relates to nix tools: - Our goal is to be more user friendly. You don't have to learn the Nix expression language or understand nix internals to be successful. - We've been able to add some opinionation and polish. Some of that is subjective, but some examples are: - We have a hybrid imperative/declarative interface. You can `flox install && flox list`, and those changes are reflected in TOML. Whereas with `nix develop` you have to edit a Nix expression - `nix develop` drops you into a bash shell, whereas `flox activate` can drop you into a bash or zsh shell (and we plan to add support for fish) - We support using git to manage environments just like nix tools do, but we've also added the option to share flox environments in ways you can't with any of those tools (flox push/flox pull/flox activate -r) and the ability to view environments in ways we feel can be more user friendly. If you create an account, you can see packages I have in my environment at https://hub.flox.dev/mkenigs/default, or if you have the CLI, you could inspect my environment with `flox list -r mkenigs/default` before using it with `flox activate -r mkenigs/default`. I think that's much more digestible than linking a flake.nix to someone who doesn't know the Nix expression language reply the_duke 15 hours agorootparentSo what you are offering here is essentially a small UX improvement over sharing a flake with a devshell in a Git repo? I'm the first to admit that nix is way too cumbersome to use, but this alone doesn't seem like enough value add. reply joshcsimmons 15 hours agorootparentIf you think this is a \"small\" improvement on Nix's UX you clearly have never used Nix. reply pxc 10 hours agorootparentOr they've used it so much that they no longer have to think about stepping around Nix's UX quirks. Once the habit is automatic a lot of the UX difficulties that can be striking at first become invisible, or at least forgettable. reply d0mine 8 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like: \"Dropbox is a small UX improvement over rsync\" reply eikenberry 15 hours agorootparentprevThe value needed by Nix is not more/better tech but an on-ramp for people who want to use Nix without learning all about all the various ways to do thing. Just having a single, opinionated onboarding experience will add a ton of value to the project. reply notresidenter 16 hours agorootparentprevYou know you can just write `nix develop -c zsh` or `nix develop -c fish` or whatever, right? reply tomberek 15 hours agorootparentYes, I'm also a Nix maintainer. `nix develop` does many other things, originally based on re-creating the build environment of a derivation. This means that it is not ideal for the case of development environments that must support more than just building. reply OJFord 36 minutes agorootparentIsn't there nix shell for that, and nix-direnv to activate automatically? reply notresidenter 12 hours agorootparentprevInteresting, thanks. reply tripdout 14 hours agorootparentprevDoes this save environment variables and aliases defined in the Nix devshell? reply shubber 16 hours agoparentprevPut another way, I would think that individual engineers would be better off learning the underlying tech and the tools provided that go with them. I think it's very possible that Flox (or devenv or...) reaches EOL, or ceases to track nixpkgs appropriately, or any of the other ways that software rots. Where nix develop is going to last as long as Nix Flakes do, and there's incentive to provide a migration path to whatever's next. Even more important: every abstraction is going to leak. Maybe the Flox CLI \"looks\" cleaner or whatever, but in the end you'll still need to learn Nix to use it effectively. Why learn twice as much stuff as you need? reply pxc 16 hours agorootparentI use Nix at work, to distribute tools to (among other places) developers outside my team. I'm also the person within my team who knows Nix best. We're currently using devenv.sh to present a prettier interface to those users, who are developers. I don't expect those devs to learn much about Nix, but I do expect to some extent to be responsible for educating and supporting them as issues inevitably come up. I've not really tried Flox (now that I can do so without any signups and the CLI tool is open-source, I'm more seriously tempted to dig in than before!). But for me, the proposition isn't really learning 2 things vs. 1 or even asking other people to do so. The question is which interface is going to be easier for me to support— my expectation is that if/when things go awry, I'll end up relying on the same Nix knowledge either way. So I don't really see Flox changing what the developers I support are expected to master, but if Flox is something that developers I support find convenient and pleasant to use, I can imagine it reducing UX and documentation work I have to do with the Nix-based tooling I'm gluing together. It may also save me infrastructure burdens, in terms of setting up shared binary caches or helping users share environment configs and Nix code. I'd really love to support a developer so obsessive and curious that they felt the need to learn and master Nix because they were using Flox as a dependency of my project. I'd like to think that as someone who knows my way around the Nix ecosystem, I could make exploring how Nix works and how Flox adds to it fun for them. But I can also imagine being that developer and feeling annoyed at the prospect of 'having' to learn two tools. I hear that. reply joshcsimmons 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes a python developer NEED to know how C works to write automation scripts that work reasonably well? This logic is silly. reply pxc 14 hours agorootparentThey don't, but I have respect and sympathy for developers who prefer to dig deeper with learning their tools, and how that might make them tend to prefer stacks with fewer layers sometimes. I think it's a valid concern, especially for hobbyist and experimental/autodidactic use cases. In a corporate environment or within a team, people typically specialize and defer to each other in various areas, so maybe it matters less there. reply mrd3v0 17 hours agoparentprevOr https://devenv.sh reply slekker 17 hours agorootparentor https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/ :ˆ) reply anonzzzies 17 hours agorootparentAh! The modern hell of choice. Can’t these peeps just work together and make one great thing instead of fragmenting over and over? I think I know the answers but have to ask anyway, hope to learn. reply mrd3v0 13 hours agorootparentI guess it somewhat follows the Nix tradition of having several pieces of software doing the same exact thing and confusing the users about which one to pick. reply zamalek 16 hours agorootparentprevDevenv and devbox are completely different. Devenv will merely automatically install envars into your env from a plugin (one of which handles nix). If you aren't using devenv you are missing out, irrespective of whether you use nix. Devbox is a direct alternative to Flox. Edit: all incorrect, I got confused. There are indeed to many of these Nix wrappers. reply vhodges 16 hours agorootparentI think you're referring to direnv as opposed to devenv.sh which does compete in the same space. Numentide was working on one too. I am using devenv.sh at work, at home I just nix develop (but this doesn't do services, but there was a flake util just announced that adds support for that I need to check out). reply OJFord 16 hours agorootparentWhy `nix develop`, not `nix shell` or `nix profile`? Because you're also packaging the final result with nix anyway or something? > nix develop starts a bash shell that provides an interactive build environment nearly identical to what Nix would use to build installable. Inside this shell, environment variables and shell functions are set up so that you can interactively and incrementally build your package. I'm not saying it's bad or wrong - it's a long time since I've used nix and it's changed/progressed a lot, and I'm considering it again so just keen to understand. edit: also just found shell.nix & nix-direnv integration - https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/declarative-shell#decl... reply vhodges 8 hours agorootparentI am no expert, but yes, it's flakes for my projects. It keeps the build time tooling separate (eg Go compiler, node version,etc) from the main system (so I could for example have different versions for different projects). It also makes it easier for others that might (one day) contribute to my projects to start developing (assuming they're using nix) with the same tooling and versions that I am using. aiui, nix shell was the non-flake way of doing things and nix develop is for flakes (this is probably a gross over simplification!) reply zamalek 13 hours agorootparentprevNix shell is for devshells declared as a top-level in your flake. 99.99% of the time this is identical to the primary package, but sometimes having additional things around is helpful. E.g. I use justfiles for local dev (meaning I have to pull Just in as a dep), but that isn't something used for a real package build. Nix profile is for activating profiles, which even a seasoned nix user would have little use for directly. It's what underpins home-manager as an example. reply OJFord 12 hours agorootparentI suppose what I'm missing then is why you ever need to switch from nix shell to (your just etc. -less) nix develop environment? Is it that the latter is for actually building/running the debug build locally, like a `docker compose up --build` for example? i.e. it's the environment the thing you're working on runs in, but you working on it run in nix shell (with just, git, docker compose in that example, your editor, etc.)? reply srid 16 hours agorootparentprev> this doesn't do services, but there was a flake util just announced that adds support for that You must be referring to services-flake: https://community.flake.parts/services-flake reply vhodges 8 hours agorootparentyes, thanks! reply smw 16 hours agorootparentprevI think you're discussing direnv, not devenv -- which appears to be a direct alternative to Flox reply soraminazuki 11 hours agorootparentprevThat’s equivalent to demanding the Python community to abolish PyPI in favor of making the “one great” standard library.

Imagine if the Arch or Ubuntu installer halted, told you neutrally / BBC style criticism-focussed even about systemd, and then asked you how to proceed: systemd or sysvinit? reply anonzzzies 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, I wonder about all language communities why they don’t coordinate efforts indeed. I see monthly arrivals of new ‘js runtimes’ and package managers as well. And that eco system is a lot larger than nix. If these talented people would band together, wouldn’t we get a better endresult as a whole? If it’s commercial products then that doesn’t work, but this is all nice open source under good licenses, so outside ego, what’s the benefit of 50000 things that do the same thing except 499XX*n hours of life wasted? reply mikenikles 7 hours agoprevHow does it compare to the existing Devbox project (https://www.jetpack.io/devbox)? Does Flox have an optional cloud solution as well? Can Flox install specific versions of Nix packages? What about OS-specific dependencies? I've worked with tools like that for 5 years. Curious to understand what Flox brings to the table that we don't already have. reply Rucadi 17 hours agoprevI really don't understand why should I use this over plain nix, can you elaborate? reply cal85 16 hours agoparentI just want clean, repeatable environments for different projects. I’ve tried getting into Nix a few times but I always get overwhelmed by all the different things it is/does. This looks 100x simpler to me. reply Rucadi 15 hours agorootparentHmm... I understand that if you don't know anything about the language or what is a flake, it may be a little bit difficult. But really, adding a new package to your environment once you have a flake setup, which a minimal one is trivial, is just adding the name of the package. Here you have a flake.nix example from leptos. https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/blob/main/flake.nix You want a new dependency? Add it to buildInputs. (this one doesn't have packages setup, but anything in the attribute set packages will be available in path) You want to search a package: https://search.nixos.org/packages (or use the cli) you want to test a package before adding it? nix-shell -p or nix shell for example. Heck, even if you want it more easy, you could write a tool in less than 100 lines that adds packages names to .json/.yaml/.toml, which allows you to parse it using the nix language and a simple cli written with bash functions to add/remove packages if you wanted. That's why it is hard for me to understand this project as a product, it seems like a wrapper to the most basic things :\\ reply waldrews 9 hours agorootparentRespectfully, I'd like to nominate \"Heck, even if you want it more easy, you could write a tool in less than 100 lines that adds packages names to .json/.yaml/.toml, which allows you to parse it using the nix language and a simple cli written with bash functions to add/remove packages if you wanted.\" as the next \"why would you need dropbox\" comment ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9224 ). reply malkosta 14 hours agorootparentprevI once needed to install a specific version of a package on my nix environment.

Does it have any kind of simpler syntax for overlays? Or you are referring to pinning a nixpkgs version? I'm not really against tools that make it easier to use nix, I think devenv is a nice tool and I like that it doesn't hide nix, the same way I love home-manager and use it all the time. reply malkosta 13 hours agorootparent> I like that it doesn't hide nix Yep. That's my main argument for it against devbox. > Does it have any kind of simpler syntax for overlays? Yes, it does. But what helps isn't that, but the concise docs with just the information I need to know to get up and running quickly: https://devenv.sh/getting-started/ I've read multiple docs/books on Nix, but I always find myself lost when I need to accomplish anything simple. With devenv, I can spot most of my answers from the docs menu. They are all a single click distant from me. reply dataangel 13 hours agorootparentprevI tried NixOS because I needed to recreate an environment with a specific GCC version. It was absolute hell, you are likely looking back on your experience with rose colored glasses now that you know how things work. Even really really really basic shit was insane, here's an example: the whole system is built on hashes, and there is no consistent format for them! I was getting an error with hash A even though I explicitly requested hash B, and I couldn't figure out why. Turns out nix can't decide whether to use base32 or base64.... I also tried passing arguments to specify the GCC version in like 10 different ways, *that all failed silently*. Staying far far far away from Nix even though on paper I should love it. Edit: oh yeah and `nix shell` and `nix-shell` both exist and don't do the same thing reply tomberek 16 hours agoparentprevI understand that Nix solves many problems and indeed bet on its ability to do so. It is why I've put so much effort into Nix itself. However, Nix poses a relatively steep learning curve being built up from first principles making it very general. Flox aims at simplifying this by narrowing the problem field and providing specialized abstractions and interfaces for those who want to benefit from nix' capabilities without needing to becoming a nix expert at day 0.

But - Have you ever seen the Microservices video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ I was leading the developer products team at Facebook back then and started a project around injecting remote capabilities into local dev. Short of it was that thousands of developers were waiting 45 minutes for cold builds... Part of the initial steps for the project was to map out the entire SDLC (so we can get a sense of what parts of the toolchains we need to rebuild), that's where that video above comes into mind if you look at that whiteboard towards the end... Visualizing how complex we've made it is what got me into the headspace of - this can't actually be how we go about this. reply danhudlow 9 hours agoprevWhat I desperately want is the generation of a lock file so that environment installs are cryptographically guaranteed to be repeatable byte-for-byte.

So the rpm/dev/OSX installers first install Nix, and then installs flox itself. If you have Nix already, you can try it out as described here: https://flox.dev/docs/install-flox/#install-with-existing-ni.... side-note: with further improvements to Nix as a library, it may be possible to make installing Nix not necessary for flox to function, but this is on a longer time horizon... don't hold your breath reply WatchDog 11 hours agoprevHow does nix deal with different CPU architectures? If I have some developers using an ARM based macbook, and some devs on an x86_64 based machine, is it easy to support both without much maintenance? reply takeda 9 hours agoparentOne way of thinking about Nix is like A Makefile on steroids. It will build what is needed for the right platform. It is also smart enough that you can add cache server and when it needs something that already is in the cache[1] it will download and use binary package seamlessly. Those packages are built from the same sources with same (or almost the same) configuration options and for all intents and purposes should be nearly identical. So while you use your devenv, it will download and use the right packages for your architecture, and if something is missing on the cache server it will build it locally. Now as ARM Mac's are as popular as the intel ones, people are making sure that the packages build on both. [1] nix generates a hash which is based on the package source code, compile options, architecture etc. and uses that for the lookup. reply carlhjerpe 10 hours agoparentprevThe Nix binary cache does x86_64-linux, aarch64-linux, x86_64-darwin, aarch64-darwin and maybe others. Every single package is different, but built from the same source. You won't be sharing binary cache even for python or other interpreted things since they depend on \"stdenv\" which contains bash. But in practice it's really easy. Though if you're all into robustness you should probably test on the same arch you deploy to eventually. reply ildjarn 11 hours agoprevLast I tried to use Nix there was lots of confusion over flakes - some tutorials suggested using them and others saying they are still in development. Has the situation improved? reply takeda 10 hours agoparentI believe so, it seems like almost all (or all?) solutions listed here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39696038 use flakes underneath. I think the flakes problem come from two things: - flakes are labelled experimental for years now (I think it might be almost 5 years now) which creates confusion with new users, but they are universally used nearly everywhere now - there seems to be some bad blood[1] between https://determinate.systems/ company and the long time Nix users and developers who are accusing them that they are using Nix for their benefit with not contributing back. From my understanding Determinate Systems introduced flakes and probably this why there's some resistance to it by some. But to answer your question, pretty much everyone adopted flakes and guides that don't use them are most likely old. [1] https://discourse.nixos.org/t/introducing-flakehub/32044 reply grhmc 7 hours agorootparentDetSys founder here :). Firstly, congratulations to Flox on the launch. DetSys is founded by Nix's inventor Eelco, and me -- a fairly long time community member (since ~2016.) We're also loaded with long term Nix users and contributors. We (the company) didn't invent flakes, and I didn't have anything to do with it either. While working at Tweag, Eelco worked with Target to develop the idea. I'm not sure where this idea of bad blood or not contributing back comes from, either. The vast, vast majority of our code and products are completely FOSS, and our most popular product (the Determinate Nix Installer) is deliberately licensed in a way that upstream Nix can take it and integrate it however they want, any time they want. And I hope they do! We also invest heavily in contributions directly upstream. We're long time open source contributors and advocates, and that doesn't change now that we started a company. I think there is a lot of compression of time and history here that has lead to lot of pretty baseless accusations and confusion. I think some people who don't like the change don't like it because they've built their own mechanisms to get what flakes provides. That's fine, nobody has to use flakes. The old ways aren't going away. Some folks don't like them because they're not technically perfect or bug-free. That's fine, too, but they're not becoming more stable by pretending flakes don't exist. I look at threads like the one you linked as evidence we're doing something interesting. Nobody would care if what we were doing was useless. One point that is absolutely true, though: DetSys is 100% contributed to the version of the future where Nix + Flakes is the thing. Flakes solve such vast problems that I feel there is no going back. This is the basis for the Determinate Nix Installer: we guarantee flake stability, and use the installer as the wedge to keep that promise with our users. This promise has been the basis of our work on FlakeHub and our just-launched-today FlakeHub Cache. Unfortunately, nix.dev -- an official Nix documentation source -- specifically does not teach much about Flakes. To the degree of introducing documentation for unmaintained tools that see very low community adoption: https://nix.dev/guides/recipes/dependency-management. We've taken a strong position on flakes by introducing our installer and zero-to-nix.com, a flake-first documentation source because of this confusion. I have asked numerous times for the various Nix leadership teams to make a choice on if flakes are the future or not, but as we can all plainly see: they have not chosen to do so. This confusion about flakes comes from the very top, unfortunately. I find this very motivating for building the best Nix company I can, to support the adoption of Nix and flakes in interesting places around the world. reply amarshall 8 hours agoparentprevI don’t know anyone who is recommending against flakes these days. The “experimental” label is more about the API stability than completeness, bugginess, or anything else. There are certain scenarios where the performance can be problematic, but there are workarounds and permanent solutions are being worked on. Nevertheless, using flakes extensively at home and work. reply Qwertious 2 hours agorootparent>I don’t know anyone who is recommending against flakes these days. The “experimental” label is more about the API stability than completeness, bugginess, or anything else. \"Experimental\" traditionally means \"if you use it and it breaks, then that's your fault\". This is because ifdid break, the entire internet would dogpile on any complainers with \"IT WAS LABELLED EXPERIMENTAL WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING.\" It's the same as ignoring Kickstarter warnings; if a project gives you a warning then tell you to ignore that same warning, don't; if things go to shit then everyone will say \"YOU WERE WARNED WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING.\" They cannot un-warn you, that's not how this social situation works. I'm not claiming this is fair, I'm just claiming this is how it plays out in practice. The only safe response to this is to assume that anything labelled \"experimental\" is exactly what it says. And to be clear, that means the only safe response is to ignore any claims that the thing labelled \"experimental\" is safe. Or to put it another way: if you don't mean it's experimental and do recommend it to the average user, then don't use the term \"experimental\". reply methyl 15 hours agoprevHow do you compare to devenv and devbox?

I'm Michael Brantley, Flox CTO and formerly responsible for build and release engineering at the D. E. Shaw group. The high-level summary can be found in https://flox.dev/about but the back story is that I started diving into Nix in late 2017, and once I finally understood how Nix worked, how amazing the Nix community is and the incredible potential of the Nixpkgs collection I immediately realized I'd been \"doing it wrong\" all this time! It was then that we embarked on an effort to deploy Nix internally, but soon ran into many obstacles to enterprise adoption. As I'm sure will be similar for many other teams, our Nix deployment started life as a series of bespoke applications and systems created to address such obstacles, but I suppose the difference in our case was that we had an internal venture studio called DESCOvery who recognized the impact that it could have on devs everywhere, and then worked closely with Ron, founding engineer Tom Bereknyei and me to launch the business.

I normally would actually welcome GPL, because it allows to keep project being open source. Though looks like project also comes with CLA where anyone who contributes surrenders their copyright to FloxDev, Inc. What this means, is that no one can fork it and make from it a commercial product. Many would say this is great as it can keep the project open source, except the CLA gives FloxDev, Inc. option to change license at any moment to whatever they want, including making the project fully closed source. I don't think such project can be called open source. It feels like a Trojan horse to fool developers (kind of what Hashicorp did).

The link at https://flox.dev/terms-conditions is correct. Fixing.... thanks! reply stephenr 16 hours agoprevSo, I read about a similar-ish tool to this recently, `devenv` - it sounds like both tools are based around Nix. The other article (talking about `devenv`) was discussing a migration away from running Vagrant. I had questions then that I still have now with this tool: assuming this, like `devenv` doesn't directly run a VM, how exactly do you solve actual platform differences - e.g. it's quite common to have developers using macOS or Windows, and production servers running a Linux distro. Sure, some things work the same or close-enough to the same, but even with scripting languages (no aot compiling) that have pretty good cross platform support, there are differences either in features, extensions, or in system level dependencies (i.e. a database server, cache server, etc). Vagrant is one solution to this problem, as is \"Docker in a VM\", albeit a little less flexible IMO - essentially you run a \"close to production\" environment inside a VM, with zero worries about what the host environment is, because the software is still running in basically the same environment as prod. The rise of Arm workstations has made this interesting, but Debian 12 on Amd64 is still a heck of a lot closer to Debian 12 on Arm64 than it is to macOS or Windows on anything. So what is the Nix solution to this problem? It sounds like the best you'd hope for would be to run Nix inside a VM, potentially managed by something like Vagrant (thus giving you a reproducible VM running a reproducible environment), but a number of comments I've seen about using `devenv` or nix made a point of \"no VM required\".. so that just makes me wonder, am I missing some vital piece of information about Nix, or are these people just running much simpler dev environments than I'm used to? reply Rucadi 15 hours agoparentUsing Nix as a package manager works best with a repository called \"Nixpkgs\". Nixpkgs focuses on reproducible builds, that means that for the same inputs, you always are going to get the same binary output. All of Nixpkgs are built using nixpkgs, and they don't depend on any library outside nixpkgs, including glibc and compilers. That means that you can \"lock\" your packages into a version, and you ensure that it will run the exact same version and configuration in all machines that you install it, no matter the underlying OS or how old/new it is, glibc problems etc... This is the power of Nix. All of this can be done via a simple Flake.nix -> define the system Flake.lock -> automatically generated, defines the exact version of nixpkgs among others. (Can also be done via channels but flakes are better imo) reply tomberek 15 hours agoparentprevNix runs alongside other distributions in various OSs, including OSX. (Windows is being looked at, do not hold your breath.) The cross-platform capability of `flox` comes from our usage of Nixpkgs, which includes allowance for some of the differences between platforms and makes them less of an issue. If some piece of software has a specific difference when run on different platforms and you rely upon that difference, then your need to use that platform in some way: native, VM, translator, etc. Nix does make it easier to manage, build, distribute, multiple kinds of software. Flox environments leverage this same foundation to expose the same environment on multiple systems and we plan to work on this more. What in particular would you be looking for? reply focom 16 hours agoprevSorry to be this guy, but why is Nix better than a docker dev container? reply tomberek 16 hours agoparentIt's not necessarily that one is better than another; it can be complementary. I tend to think that Nix makes many of the reasons to use a container superfluous, but there still remain other reasons to use containers. For example, a talk about using both Docker and Nix (yep, that's me ;) ): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l17oRkhgqHE reply Rucadi 15 hours agoparentprevI have to use both at the same time. I have a Docker with an old version of centos which for some reason is the one provided to us. I then create an \"overlay\" over it using nix, so I can actually use software with newer glibc etc... easily. Regardless of that, nix is way better than docker, in the sense that docker doesn't ensure reproducibility, you can build a Dockerfile in two different days, and get different versions of packages installed, this is simply not possible with nix, you have complete control over your tools. And if you decide to port your application to a \"nix package\", you have complete control over all the dependencies of you application, a reproducible way to build it, and an easy way to deploy it. reply OJFord 16 hours agoparentprevOn non-Linux it should be faster/less overhead; on all platforms I suppose it's just arguably easier/quicker to make changes & 'rebuild', and then the result is that that just is your environment, it's not a container inside it that you have to exec into or run commands through or make your IDE use or whatever. But mostly it's just two different approaches and people will be happy to argue about why there's is better, or that they don't use either (just the system environment (on a non-NixOS system..) as it were). reply ParetoOptimal 15 hours agorootparentI mostly agree, but one big thing missing is Nix is reproducible by default while docker is only repeatable. reply OJFord 15 hours agorootparentYeah, I was just trying to avoid anything to which you could say 'well I can do that with docker [and appropriate care & attention]'. reply gregwebs 14 hours agoprevThere are several tools in this space now- nix is maturing and people are realizing how useful nix can be for dev envs. * [devenv](devenv.sh) - I am using it and loving it, but worried that the development is not moving forward * [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox) * [daytona](https://www.daytona.io/docs/usage/workspaces/) * [devshell](https://github.com/numtide/devshell) * [bob.build](bob.build) more focused on the build I am glad that flox is pushing its development forward.

One of the key usages we see is to automate tasks that are personal to users and require them to be logged in, for instance automating the process of paying bills, filling out forms or pulling data from specific websites. LaVague is built on open-source projects and leverages open-sources models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests. ✨ Features Natural Language Processing: Understands instructions in natural language to perform browser interactions. Selenium Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Selenium for automating web browsers. Open-Source: Built on open-source projects such as transformers and llama-index, and leverages open-source models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests. Local models for privacy and control: Supports local models like Gemma-7b so that users can fully control their AI assistant and have privacy guarantees. Advanced AI techniques: Uses a local embedding (bge-small-en-v1.5) first to perform RAG to extract the most relevant HTML pieces to feed the LLM answering the query, as directly dropping the full HTML code would not fit in context. Then leverages Few-shot learning and Chain of Thought to elicit the most relevant Selenium code to perform the action without having to finetune the LLM (Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO) for code generation. 🚀 Getting Started You can try LaVague in the following Colab notebook: 🗺 Roadmap This is an early project but could grow to democratize transparent and aligned AI models to undertake actions for the sake of users on the internet. We see the following key areas to explore: Fine-tune local models like a gemma-7b-it to be expert in Text2Action Improve retrieval to make sure only relevant pieces of code are used for code generation Support other browser engines (playwright) or even other automation frameworks Keep up to date with our project backlog here. 🙋 Contributing We would love your help in making La Vague a reality. Please check out our contributing guide to see how you can get involved! Please also join our Discord community where we can chat about the project further!",

So far all of these are… not working except for trivial cases. This one is also choking on basic saas sites; especially the ones with spinners while getting content. Notice that this type of tool would be great for the millions of enterprise ‘internal app’ garbage ‘integration’ that is now done manually by copy/pasting data from pdf to email to excel to app1 to app2 to app3 to excel to email to app4 to app5 to word to email etc etc. But, because before the latest ssr fad, everything was client side loading SPAs with a billion spinners so many of those departmental/enterprise apps/saas are that. None of the solutions named here can handle that properly, so in the end it’s a frustrating experience of repeating yourself 10 times with maybe one success. The cases with static or fully ssr sites was not really needing much automation (although it could fix breaking changes to the site automagically); those are trivial with existing tools already. Just a little bit of manual setup (the right selectors). reply wjnc 3 hours agoparentAn RPA-team that does work for me as a client told me that with a certain system they just use a 20 second window between actions. The robot is not much faster than colleagues, but a lot more sturdy and appreciative of menial work. I curse all developers of bigcorp software that do not create an API for all functionalities exposed to users. Likewise, we don’t praise those that do enough! reply anonzzzies 2 hours agorootparentYes, that's the approach I take, but in that case, the problem is that Playwright with Chrome plugin + our own bag of scripts for detecting spinners etc, is faster AND more accurate than these AI attempts. These RPA things with LLMs would only work in case they can actually venture out alone and Get Shit Done. If I have to sit and wait and reprompt, I might as well just get the Playwright script which will work actually every time. But I know it's early days! There is a reason I test ALL of these every few months. reply wruza 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy use hard timeouts if you can wait for selector and then 100ms more?

In my opinion of course. reply atonse 8 hours agoprevMy experience at least from 2010-2011 was that selenium type tests were woefully brittle and unreliable. Are they generally better these days? If so, is it due to different protocols like remote debugging and headless browsers? Please be kind to this old man and his outdated views. reply creesch 1 hour agoparentTo be honest, that likely had little to do with Selenium (although there were fewer options around back then) but more with the expectations around the tests. UI front-end tests are often brittle because people try to test things through them that should have been tested in earlier stages. Either on API level or unit level. Just to give a simple example. Say you have a login screen. It has a username input, password input, login button and finally a div to show any messages. The only things you actually want to test here are: 1. A succes login action 2. A action that leads to a message being shown in the message div. 3. *If* there are multiple categories of messages (error, warning, etc) possibly one of each message. What you don't want to test here are all sorts of login variations that ultimately test input validation (API level) or some other mechanism surrounding password (possibly unit testing). The problem is that often, and certainly the decade earlier you are talking about, is that companies often take their manual regression tests and just throw them into automation. Forgetting that those manual regressions tests are equally brittle but that this is often overlooked due to the way manual tests are done and reported on. Having said all that. Selenium is still a solid option in a java environment. But as others have pointed out, there are other very solid options out there like Playwright. But these also can be equally as brittle if the tests are not setup properly. reply imp0cat 4 hours agoparentprevIf you ever find that you need to automate some browsing and Selenium comes to your mind, banish that thought! :) Do yourself a favour, use Playwright instead. https://playwright.dev/ It's a headless browser that's both faster and less flaky than Selenium. reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 3 hours agorootparentI use playwright to run an automated test every time I deploy to staging. I don't think it's caught any real bugs yet because I haven't actually broken anything but the playwright script keeps running reliably it includes a login and fills out a big long complicated form. Works great. Very quick. Selenium was slow and unreliable. reply pjerem 3 hours agorootparentprevI hate Microsoft with a passion but Playwright is a gem. reply DanyWin 8 hours agoparentprevHere we just provide natural language instructions and the LLMs generate the code appropriate at a given time. If the site changes, we can regenerate the code using the same instruction, so unless the site changes a lot, it is quite robust reply atonse 8 hours agorootparentRight so in general I can see this in use by development teams itself cuz we don't want to sit there and manually write tests. I'd love to tell it to just log in to my own website, click on certain pieces of functionality and repeat that. Especially with more casual day to day tasks. Heck, we could even auto-generate tests from a bug report (where the steps to reproduce are written in plain english by non-technical testers). That means less time for a dev to actually reproduce those steps, right? reply DanyWin 8 hours agorootparentExactly! In the future, testers could just write tests in natural language. Every time we detect, for instance with a vision model, that the interface changed, we ask the Large Action Model to recompute the appropriate code and have it be executed. Regarding generating tests from bug report totally possible! For now we focus on having a good mapping from low level instructions (\"click on X\") -> code, but once we solve that, we can have another AI take bug reports -> low level instructions, and use the previously trained LLM!

I agree that this kind of tool has the potential to take more jobs, but companies looking to do this kind of thing have had a number of options available for awhile now. New tech like this will accelerate the trend. reply dbish 6 hours agorootparentOne of the big problems with RPA is that it's very very specific, and requires less natural tool interactions that we can do with the new models (or will soon be able to do). It should be as simple as having an AI system \"look over your shoulder\" while you tell them what you're doing once or twice, maybe they ask a question some time in the future, but they can automate it from there like teaching a junior person on your team. I think one of they pieces to do that is actually being able to explain, not just silently watch your screen, and ask questions,make it a dialogue, even once that you might get pinged on later if they hit a snag or a situation changes and they need confirmation of something. RPA today is really nothing like that. reply haolez 8 hours agoparentprevAn old executive that I know once said that he saw multiple times in his career a back office task being automated away, but the person that did that one task had 20 other tasks beyond that single one that were not yet automated, so the job remained.

But I think this challenge will still present itself. reply MattGaiser 7 hours agorootparent> but the person that did that one task had 20 other tasks beyond that single one that were not yet automated, so the job remained. I used to be an innovation analyst at a bank and we looked at automating tasks quite frequently and found that many could be automated. But you are right on the money for why it did not happen. Tasks are straightforward to automate. Entire job roles are not. If you want to save headcount, you need to automate some tasks and then rethink one, if not several, job roles. That is a lot messier to do. In most cases, we decided not to bother as we didn't think there would be a net savings. reply DanyWin 8 hours agoparentprevIt could indeed have an impact on jobs, just like any productivity gains have destroyed jobs. However, the net gains, in my humble opinion, could be phenomenal. Imagine all the time, mental energy and money spent on navigating through the legacy of today's society? From the legacy legal systems that is super complex, to legacy websites, I believe there is much time to be saved so we can dedicate resources to what truly matters, intellectual pursuits or quality time with friends and family reply brailsafe 6 hours agorootparent> However, the net gains, in my humble opinion, could be phenomenal. Doesn't seem like a very humble opinion, every time people lose work they need to find income somewhere else or end up working more anyway. Productivity gains equalling more free time has only really ever worked for people who end up or who were already unemployed or self-employed, otherwise it's propaganda spread by people who stand to gain. Even in cases where someone's job became only less manual, it's not like they suddenly got the rest of the day off to spend with their family, they just ended up operating the machine all day anyway, and often getting paid less to do it, to a point where eventually families and friends as a concept started becoming more rare. reply pjerem 3 hours agorootparentprev> Imagine all the time, mental energy and money spent on navigating through the legacy of today's society? I can see the business perspective for sure. But I really don’t think humanity have the luxury to consume even more energy to run billions of GPUs to do what a programmer team could do and in the meantime having an excuse to not fix its legacy. That sounds like either totally cyberpunk or very late stage capitalism. We need to reduce global energy consumption and fix the society as much as we can, not going full throttle in the current direction. reply MattGaiser 7 hours agorootparentprev> However, the net gains, in my humble opinion, could be phenomenal. And historically, have always been phenomenal.

They would have been similarly horrified if you told them that virtually nobody would work in textile manufacturing in the Western World. But in reality, the jobs in the former are considered so dismal that they are heavily staffed by desperate people who have no other legal work options and migrant workers from poor countries and jobs in the latter pay so poorly globally that you would be better off running a lemonade stand in a Western country.

    "originBody": "IRS Direct File — IRS has launched its free tax filing service, Direct File, in 12 states Direct File has many limits, but nearly 19M people in 12 states may be eligible. Jon Brodkin - 3/12/2024, 8:46 PM Enlarge / Internal Revenue Service (IRS) headquarters building on January 30, 2024, in Washington, DC. Getty ImagesJ. David Ake reader comments 133 The Internal Revenue Service's free tax filing service, Direct File, is now available in 12 states for taxpayers with simple tax returns. The service, available in English and Spanish, underwent \"weeks of successful testing\" before the launch, the US Treasury Department said today. \"Direct File provides a free, secure option for taxpayers with simple tax situations in 12 states to file their taxes directly with the IRS,\" the Treasury Department said. \"Direct File is easy to use, with no hidden junk fees, and works as well on a smartphone as it does on a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Direct File shows taxpayers the math so they can be sure that their return is accurate, and they are getting the refund they are entitled to.\" You can check whether you qualify to use the system at directfile.irs.gov. Based on the eligibility restrictions in the IRS program, the Treasury Department said it \"estimates that one-third of all federal income tax returns filed could be prepared using Direct File.\" In the 12 eligible states combined, the department estimates that 18.7 million taxpayers are eligible for Direct File. That includes a high of 5.2 million taxpayers in California and a low of 80,000 in Wyoming. \"Thousands of taxpayers across all 12 states have already successfully filed returns during the pilot's testing phase,\" the Treasury Department said. The government is calling this year's version of Direct File a pilot program. It will presumably expand to more states and perhaps have fewer restrictions on who can file in future years. State tax options vary Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York worked with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot, the IRS said in October 2023. The pilot is also available in eight states without an income tax: Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. Advertisement The IRS originally said that Alaska, which also has no income tax, was slated to be part of the pilot. But the state was not included in the end. \"The Direct File pilot does not support reporting the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend for federal income tax reporting purposes,\" the IRS was quoted as saying in January. There are different options for state taxes depending on what state you live in. There's a free state filing tool for Arizona and New York that integrates with IRS Direct File. Users in California and Massachusetts will be directed to their respective state's online tax tools for filing state taxes. What you can and can’t file Direct File supports employment income, unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, and $1,500 or less in interest income. But there are many limits that would prevent taxpayers from using the system. Income types that cannot be reported with Direct File include income from payment apps, online marketplaces, or payment cards; income from independent contractor and gig work; income from rent, prizes, and awards; income from pension and retirement account distributions; allocated tips and unreported tips; and alimony. Direct File is further limited by the amount of income. You can't use Direct File if your wages were over $200,000, or $160,200 if you had more than one employer. Direct File also isn't available to those who use the filing status \"Married Filing Separately\" and had wages of more than $125,000. For a married couple filing a joint return, there is a combined wage limit of $250,000. There's another limit related to how you obtain health insurance. Direct File won't work if you bought health insurance from a HealthCare.gov marketplace or if you withdrew money from a health savings account. Other types of health insurance are supported. Direct File supports the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Credit for Other Dependents but does not support other types of credits. Itemized deductions also are not supported, though the IRS says that about 90 percent of people filing federal taxes use the standard deduction. reader comments 133 Jon Brodkin Jon has been a reporter for Ars Technica since 2011 and covers a wide array of telecom and tech policy topics.

IRS is working with Login.gov to upgrade Login.gov to deprecate ID.me for this purpose [2] [3]. Would it make sense to not proceed with this pilot until this was ready? Certainly not; Login.gov will catch up and meet IRS in the future as Direct File expands next filing season.

The call to action is to ensure, through pressure, that the desired outcome is reached. Are we on track? It appears so. reply generalizations 18 hours agorootparentIDK. I've seen too much bureaucracy where a bad solution (with properties the bureaucrat likes) is implemented with promises to improve later (into something the petitioner wants). But after the initial solution is implemented, all they gotta do is procrastinate - and the whole time they procrastinate, they get what they want. Why change it? All the bureaucrat has gotta deal with is a bit of complaining. reply sanderjd 18 hours agorootparentThe far more common problem with bureaucracy is that nothing ever gets done because every incremental step is met with \"but this isn't perfect so you shouldn't do it!\" from one faction or another, which ensures that no step is ever made, if given credence. reply generalizations 17 hours agorootparentThe other problem with bureaucracy: \"We must do something! This is something. Let's do it.\" Just because it's important to get something done, doesn't mean we should be satisfied with something that messes other stuff up. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentAgain, the far more common problem is the one I described. Lots of people say the problem you're describing is the bigger problem, but I've spent a lot of time in the adult world now, and I conclude that no, that is not the bigger problem, at least in the US. I'm very pleased to see dissatisfaction of the form \"this isn't good enough; here are ideas for incremental improvements to it\", but have totally lost my patience with the far more common \"this isn't good enough; we should do nothing instead\". reply generalizations 16 hours agorootparentWell, I agree it's the more overt problem. But having spent some time in the adult world myself, I find that the larger problem is partial solutions piled on partial solutions, burying users in piles of steaming bureaucracy that take time and effort to wade through. Like good software, it requires principles and discipline to construct correctly and avoid 'technical debt' - though a quick&dirty solution will certainly work in the short term. I've noticed as well, it's quite common that when a well-constructed solution takes much more time (and may be harder to identify) than an quick fix, proponents of the quick fix will claim that the 'do it right' folks are actually saying we should do nothing. reply sanderjd 15 hours agorootparentWe'll have to just agree to disagree :) We simply have different philosophies; you're a perfectionist whereas I'm an incrementalist. We both have life experiences and probably personality traits that lead us to our differing preferences. In my view, \"partial solutions piled on partial solutions\" is just life as a human being, where the alternative to that is not perfect solutions with no piling required, but rather no solutions. And yes, it is just like software, where incrementalism is also the better approach, in my view. > proponents of the quick fix will claim that the 'do it right' folks are actually saying we should do nothing. We don't think you're actually saying we should do nothing, just that it's the common end result, despite your best intentions. And in the sphere of politics in particular, I think well-meaning people who really do want better solutions are often used by more cynical people who really do want to do nothing, for their own ends. Like the tax software industry lobbyists, in this case. Or like how old school environmentalists often find themselves aligned with fossil fuel industry lobbyists when it comes to building renewable or nuclear power generation, or transmission lines. I don't begrudge people their dislike of partial solutions, I just don't subscribe to the same strategy. reply Judgmentality 15 hours agorootparent> We simply have different philosophies; you're a perfectionist whereas I'm an incrementalist.

There's no justification for the IRS needing higher security than free fillable forms or normal turbo tax to deliver a similar self prepared efiling, so they are repeating the same crime the next level down, choosing a private system to provide something that benefits the IRS and is of negative value to the tax payer themself. reply sanderjd 10 hours agorootparentThat is emphatically not the status quo. reply meesles 19 hours agorootparentprev> But we don't have an alternative right now.

They will keep hounding you for years after you have moved away from the state.

Some cities collect some types of taxes, some others and so on. When it comes to stuff like taxes it may be easier to think of US as the EU. Non-free is because of lobbying by various tax prep companies. It's a large business and here in US there is thing about not wanting the US government to compete with companies.

In this case we have a multi billion dollar tax filing industry that is fighting tooth and nail to keep its cash cow around through lobbying (read: legalized bribery). reply danaris 19 hours agoparentprevThe answer is a bit complicated, but there are two major parts to it: 1) The tax filing prep companies spend ridiculous amounts lobbying to ensure both that the tax system remains complex, and that they are the only way to deal with that complexity. Fortunately, the effectiveness of this has been gradually waning, leading to things like the new service the article describes. 2) Taxes in the US are genuinely quite complicated, for some good reasons, many bad ones (including the aforementioned lobbying), and even more neutral-but-complicated ones. Both major political parties have a tendency to add extra complexity to the tax code for their own ideological (and often purely political) reasons. (But despite what many people like to propose in response to this, a flat tax wouldn't actually make things better, because progressive taxation is very important for mitigating the staggering inequality in our current system, and is not even the primary cause of the complexity. The primary cause is the difficulty of agreeing on exactly what constitutes \"income\", combined with many often-conflicting attempts to incentivize or disincentivize various things through the tax code.) reply creshal 18 hours agorootparentTaxes are genuinely quite complicated in many countries (Germany's patchwork of feudal church obligations, diffuse taxing authority spread over multiple layers of government, and \"temporary\" taxes lasting over a century has some fun surprises, e.g.), and almost nobody ever voluntarily reduces the tax code's complexity. What really sets the US apart is 1, very few other countries manage to witness so much criminal energy getting put into legislation without simply collapsing. reply lotsofpulp 19 hours agoparentprevThe US is very diffuse in taxing power. The federal government only has the power to implement procedures related to federal taxes. But the state/county/city and even other amalgamations of governments such as “metropolitan”, “transit”, or other special case governments have the ability to tax and their own jurisdiction for implementing how to collect it. In my opinion, the complexity is at a point that it is a drag on national productivity. And on top of that, it enables lots of corruption where anyone can simply claim plausible deniability and pay a small fine well worth the low probability of being punished. reply grecy 17 hours agoparentprevYou can take a step back to explain this in the \"bigger picture\" sense. The US is a for profit country. Virtually everything is done with the intent of making profit, rather than to benefit citizens. This is different than other developed countries, and the reason the US is so rich. Prisons exist to make money, not to rehab (or punish) inmates. Higher education exists to make money, not to educate. \"Healthcare\" exists to make money, not to heal people. (The list goes on and on). Companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the government (money is speech, after all) to keep it this way.

At its core, most people in the US can file taxes very simply and for free. A typical guy or gal who works a normal job and doesn't own complex investments, gives to charity reasonably but not extravagantly, etc. can file 1040EZ on-line or on paper, and the equivalent state version, for free in a few minutes. I've done this in the first few years of my career. Layered on that is a bit of \"complexity\" that occurs when you engage in activity that the government seeks to reward or discourage. EG if you start a business, or partake in equity, make more complicated types of investments, hire people, donate large (relative to your income) - then your tax work gets proportionally more complex. According to the IRS, almost 90% of filers take the standard deduction - so you can take that as a rough proxy that only 10% of filers deal with more complex situations. The fact that state taxes further complicate the situation is a small price to pay for the diversity of lifestyle that the US offers (kind of like the complexity of Unix is worth it for the freedom over the simple interface of IOS for many people.) I live in NY which is a very high tax state and therefore has complexities that are worth navigating if you're in that more complicated 10%. We could have chosen to live in a lower tax state and face a very different tax code (but also very different lifestyle in other ways) but I am happy to take on the complexity for the freedom of the choice.

IMO, I wish the government would have found and replicated (or contracted?) the service I had used before HealthCare.gov existed [0], and just bolted on the subsidies and other things they do. It is still functional today, and I've used it to get insurance since HealthCare.gov went live (specifically off-marketplace, but marketplace-compliant insurance), and it is my first stop anytime my HealthCare.gov insurance tells me the price is going up.

It's not as if the government doesn't have experience employing software developers. When you introduce a private company into the mix you get a perverse incentive to jack up the price as much as said private company can get away with.

    "originBody": "[Music] thank you as we move through life we encounter numbers that are obviously significant for example do you recognize this one 3.14152 what is this yes it would have been probably if that digit had been seven instead of four and the next 0.07 double seven what is that obviously James Bond but it turns out the surface tension of water at 25 degrees Celsius typical temperature at Oxford and if you know that number you understand lots of things for example when you shower there are lots of droplets that hanging from the from the glass pain and so on and that's all understood how large those droplets are in terms of 0.07 something that you can remember for the rest of your life now and yet some other times I need numbers which look significant but which we cannot quite a place for example when I saw this number I knew it meant something in my life but I cannot really and remember what it is so I mobilized my entire scientific education and I tried to calculate this number from that number and I really don't see where it comes from although I know I have seen it somewhere before but this morning at breakfast finally Eureka I know what it is it's of course the telephone number of them now the light motif of this lecture is 2.5 what is that well I'm you'll be happy to know that is exactly a number between two and three and I'd like to convince you that this is in some sense more than metaphorical sense the dimension in which paper membrane surface any such thing evolves lives and continues to surprise us it is between the dimension two which is intrinsic to the paper it is obviously a two-dimensional object but it's also important that paper lives inside a three-dimensional ambient space so that's the extrinsic and this is the interplay between the intrinsic ad extrinsis will which will be really the weaving theme in order to start I shall play a little magic trick on you I brought here toast a coaster excuse me a circular one and then a piece of paper which is um where I put the hole and now I put this like that and I come past the coaster circular coaster through the hole like so it is really going through you see and I haven't started cheating yet so it is really going and but when you put one next to the other obviously the diameter of the circle is greater than the diagonal of the square hole I did not stretch let alone tear and yet something larger goes through something smaller you see I can even pass it backwards from here and it is really going through as you can see and what is going on last thing is going to through a smaller thing so how is this possible because you are such a nice bunch of people I'd like to review the secret for free usually I pass around the heart but yeah you see when you fold a paper like this the largest gap that I can take advantage of is this one which used to be the diagonal of the square hole but that's not all I do I grab this sheet of paper and then I twist as I twist you might see in the camera that the part of the paper is rising away from the two-dimensional plane into the three-dimensional remaining residuous Dimension and as those two segments are aligned I squash and crease then the Gap that I have created is no longer the diagonal but it's actually the sum of those two sides and if you remember Pythagoras you have gained an extra factor of about 40 percent yeah square root of 2 minus one so that's how you can pass this through although the square it seems to be smaller than the the diameter the secret was to make a hole whose diagonal is shorter than the diameter but whose some of the suicide is longer and you can see that this kind of thing was possible although at first sight it was impossible because we escaped into the ambient 3D and then came back down into 2D and this extra freedom of going in and out is going to be really important for us do you recognize this man he's the most romantic figure in the history of mathematics perhaps you you know him so that's uh who is this thank you very much and he died at the young age of 20. now um Professor traffic is thinking oh dear talash can't do arithmetic because if you subtract 11 from 32 it's 21 not but he died shortly before his 21st birthday so he that's the gigantic Legacy for all of us and one of the simplest things that he taught us to solve is a Greek problem a problem going back to ancient Greeks and this is the problem of trisecting an angle you might have some recollection of taking an arbitrary angle and hit and dividing that into two equal parts that's the bisection with rude and Compass it's very easily done but can you do three Eco pass that is tri-section of an arbitrangle to be sure of course there are angles that can be transected for example the flat angle of 180 degrees 60 60 60 no problem but that's not the program the programming question is is there a universal algorithm using ruler and Compass straight Asian Compass alone which given any arbitrary angle Under the Sun automatically trisects it into three equal parts and if you learn a little bit of mathematics for example first dl2 of mathematics you learn that in fact there are angles that you cannot trisect with Rule and Compass alone for example something as simple looking and innocent looking at 60 degrees cannot be trisected however there is an ancient art in Japan which is more and more popular nowadays called origami Ori means fall and Kani means paper so folding of paper and with origami you can do all angles here is one example um you can see actually instead of the how do you bisect an angle let's say that your angle is given as a corner of a sheet of paper actually corner of a sheet of paper is usually 90 degrees isn't it but let's say that your angle is given there and how do you bisect it well it's very simple you just fold over until the edges are aligned you just align the edges you negotiate and one spare nicely aligned it with you crease and open and you see this beautiful line that comes out of the corner and that is the bisector of the angle that divided I'm going into equal parts nothing is simpler well trisection is no harder because you just fold over you over shoot and then come back and you make this three-fold sheet and then you just align your negotiate the corners and then you align your life until they're well done then you would crease and when you open you have to see those two beautiful lines that are coming out from the corner those are the tri-section lines and any section is no harder you go back and forth back and forth you have an end fold so decrease and then you open many people don't like this negotiating the size because they want to have every operation to be determined and discrete but in fact one of the powerful points of origami one of its secret to versatility is that you can seek for optimal answer among the whole Continuum of continuous parameters and that is in fact very important now next do you recognize this person it looks rather grumpier than the first one but he left is no less of a giant in mathematics that's and he too left a lot for us to think about he stands at the junction between the 18th and 19th century and one of the simpler problems that he allowed us to solve is this problem and you might recall drawing a regular polygon with Rule and compacts for example I showed a regular Trigon that is called a equilateral triangle you just draw a segment you plant the pivot of the composite one then they just throw a circle circular Arc at the other end you the symmetrically and that intersection is the third politics that you connect to the end in order to make an equilateral triangles regular Trigon can you draw a regular antagon with ruler and Compass alone with the end for whatever you like yeah and you probably suspect that the end has to be of a very special type it's slightly inaccurate what I'm saying but this is what the answer is forget about the power of two in the first place the N has to be essentially a product of primes of distinct forms these are very very strange Crimes of the form two to two something plus one these are called Firma primes and if you plug in various values or something you get this sequence 1 3 5 15 17 51 and so on some of these are prime some of them are not those in both face 3 5 17 are primes later on 257 and if you multiply those primes never repeat in the same factor twice but multiply them and multiply that with some power of two that's a number that can be constructed by rule and compass and regular enercon and it's even only if the power of two is easy because once you have constructed some regular angle you can always divide each of the angles into two parts bisection is easy so you can always double the number of sides you see that's why the power of 2 is cheap but the essential information is there yeah so that's the restriction but actually I've been into suspect I'm sure that with origami you can do absolutely everything so I'm going to show you how by showing how to do a regular pentagon if you show pet 5 is in the on that list so you are not going to be impressed but this will show you very very cleanly how to do a regular pentagon you take a strip of paper and you make the simplest knob that you can imagine just like so okay and then you tighten the knot and flatten it tighten and flatten tighten and flattened very very gradually and very gently Python and flattened Titan flattened and you keep tightening your flattening and eventually when you tighten the flattened sufficiently you have something that is completely flat and completely tight this is what it is and now there's parts that are sticking out I shall throw them away and when I throw these away and show you what is really in the middle in the middle you see that you have a very very beautiful regular pentagon I didn't do it anything nature took its own course and it's a beautiful exercise to show that it is a regular pentagon by the way when a professor says it's a beautiful exercise it usually means that he is too lazy to do this but it's actually a very very beautiful exercise so that's a regular pentagon now how do you do other polygons you saw that when I made a pentagon I made the simplest note so I passed through this knot once so to speak that's the simplest what about the next level up in complexity if I pass twice to make a note how twice I'm going to show you a picture in a moment but if you pass twice the next simplest note and then tighten and flatten what you get is a regular seven Bond heptagon if you fast three times regular nine gone four times regular eleven gone and so on so that's how it works here is a picture of that and in fact Professor how is some pointed out that this picture is wrong sometimes but anyway um so regular fibon you see but regular seven coins drawn here it's like to disability but the way to understand it I think is to draw a regular seven Bond already if you imagine it regular seven one I think that the inside is coated with the mirror and like a ray of light go into that seven bone and bounce off the inside bounce bounce bounce bounce bounce and you come out and that order of bouncing how the race sort of went over each other and so on gives you a pattern of the of the tightening of the of tying the knot and if you tighten up that way and and the title and flatten you get the regular seven okay so you see that one pass making a knot makes an equal five two passes n equals seven three passes in England I and so forth ah so you have access to all the regular even um old guns but wait a minute there's one number missing what about n equals three how many passes do you think you must make in the not in order to make a regular Trigon huh hey zero path and indeed that's it you come in you try to make a note but you don't succeed and you come out and then in that corner is a regular free gun hiding so it works for all odd end and once you have any both end then bisection is very easy so you access now all ends yeah so all angons can be constructed by this method okay here is a little lion that I folded and when you open it you see this um what is called origami diagram don't pay too much attention to the blue and red because those are the priest Falls and the value Force um and so they reach force and that is sorry but what is interesting is that you see it's some kind of graph as mathematicians like say or network so you have lines and and the points that are collected together and if you look at any of those points any of those vertices there are so many lines that coming in together and meeting at that point okay let's count number of lines for example there they are there you have points where four lines are meeting at each of those parts yeah okay there there is a point where as many as eight lines meet that's interesting and a little further up there is a point where six nines meet it turns out that at any point if you take a sheet of paper and fold it intentionally otherwise and then squash onto a plane and open there's some kind of graph or network that is grown at any of those points there are always an even number of lines that need now I would like you to accept this because this is actually a the simpler of the theorems and so it's the proof is not difficulty slightly tedious for the experts in the audience what is happening is that when I squashed I reduced what you might call a singular covering space which has the front back front back pattern which forces the Parry okay so that's actually easy so let's accept this so the simplest pattern is where you have four lines meeting at the point yeah this is the example those four lines make sectors whose angles Alpha Beta Gamma Delta so I'm going to give you a little present a present is usually an object and which costs money is heavy and when you go through airport Securities you know you get into trouble but the present that I brought it here for you today is a phenomenon or to better set better set is the mathematical field and you know theorem as phenomenon costs you nothing weighs exactly zero gram and when you go through airport security is there no wiserable so here is what it is that's um for the paper in with valency for and it's simplest thing that you can do is what everyone uses before breakfast and that is the square form of the organism so I'm going to trace the lines so that you see what is going on here and here okay so it's 90 degrees all over the place so that's very nice but that was done very intentionally and deliberately so if you did something much more randomly and generically this is the pattern that you see and when you open up here increases there's that there's that and there is that and there's that those are the four lines and so this is what it looks like and those are those angles which were randomly produced cannot however be arbitrary there is a very beautiful law that is satisfied among all those angles so I'd like to show that that's a present now this camera is what upside down but it's not reflective this is because it looks like my right hand yes it does so I have to write upside down but not to mirror refresh it let's see so this is Alpha do you think I'm going to get into trouble drawing Delta but that's bad very good okay this is the first time you know do I have time for digression yes I do I always could write upside down and also in the mirror image as well in any writing system in room enough with Greek colors with Hebrew alphabetic Japanese scripts and song Chinese characters but the um when I used to teach in those tutorials at Cambridge of course I would have students around a very large oak table and they were on their other side and I will write upside down to do everything including math formula that's no problem and they were all very impressed and that's the effect that I was looking for but but every year there was one or two students who noticed nothing at all very interesting but anyway so where was that okay so here is the serum those angles are not arbitrary and what are the laws of nature a mathematical theorems that are satisfied first of all sorry um those angles must add up to 360 Degrees you wish that you said it but I said it first yeah so that's the simple condition but the other condition is much more interesting it is that the opposing angles Alpha plus b gamma should equal beta plus Delta so in this picture if you look at the camera for example that kind of picture I drew there is impossible however clever you are and how the working you are to create by folding and squashing a piece of paper because the sum of that narrow sector plus the last sector is way too large compared with the remaining two angles yeah so you cannot make it that's impossible so I'd like to prove that theorem for you that Alpha plus beat gambas must be equal to Beta plus Delta by going back to how this angle was created okay here here I go that's Alpha yes seen from the other side that's Alpha but Alpha equals beta plus Delta oops minus gamma did you understand that no that was too quick so let's do that again so this is Alpha and C from the other side that's also going to angle Alpha but Alpha consists of the superposed overlap Tangles beta and Delta and so I have to actually subtract the superposition which is the the what I counted too much gamma which means that the alpha equals beta plus Delta minus gamma which is exactly the same thing as that QED okay so in general if you want to do an even number of angles that are collected at the at the point Alpha One Alpha two alpha three all the way to Alpha two n yeah so four six and any even number those angles are realizable by cramping a sheet of paper and squashing so flapping flattening crumpling if and only if they're in sufficient condition if they add up to something suitable like 360 degrees but the more important and interesting condition is that not the sum but what the mathematician is called the alternating sum plus alpha 1 minus Alpha 2 plus Alpha 3 minus Alpha 4 plus minus plus minus must close to zero that condition for four angles can be written like that two you could write it as Alpha minus beta plus gamma minus Delta equals zero and that's necessarily insufficient yeah now what I mean is that the if for example Professor hitching um gives me those angles some numbers you know real numbers possibly real numbers and if they add up to 360 degrees well probably he's a rather mischievous person so he's going to give them to me in a completely wrong order yeah but his granddaughter Olivia is a very nice person so she's going to reorder them in the correct order and if there is a correct reordering such that the alternate sum in that order closes zero then I can realize those numbers as angles by squashing a piece of paper how I take the largest of numbers that Olivia ordered and then I start folding forward and back and forward and back and forward back and when I run out of the supply of the angles I know thanks to that closure to zero condition that I also run out of angles boom I close exactly and then I crease I open and you have those beautiful lines coming out of the corner of the center and those are the elements it's exactly the same proof okay and I keep saying it's a closure condition because this is if you like the manifestation a shadow of the beginning of discrete version of homology that's neither here nor there okay so far we have been playing with mathematics especially geometry but now we'll gradually transition to physics and from thence we'll go towards engineering physiology and whatnot and you know we really have to expand our field of Investigation because the phenomena that we are talking about exists across all scales in the universe from the smallest to the largest for example in the upper left corner there I show you a photograph of a paper from Mino from the regional Mino which is a bit to the east of Kyoto this paper is made in the following fashion you take a wooden Institute of paper and then you wet it and then you take a half cut persimmon you know one of those fruits from Japan Kaki and then you scrub the paper and stretch it out with pacimon and once you have done enough of that you dry it in the sun and after it's dried you wet it against crumple and then you scrub it out to to make it flat again and you keep repeating this process and describing with persimmon emissions the fiber small fibers of the paper so much that he becomes strong and you can make from this Seminole paper you know clothes bags even shoes that last for quite a long time and those things are happening on that small scale less than a millimeter long yeah in the top right corner you see one of my best friends and you see that his trunk is lined with lots of wrinkles and they are best of biomechanical and thermal reasons why biology likes to make use of those creases and that's happening on the scale say human scale between centimeter and millimeter a few millimeters and also nature can play at this game of origami on the humongous scale for example that's the basketball Latin America that's the Andes yeah how did this mountain range come to be that's because on the one side there was the Latin American plate on the other side there was a Pacific Plate to be precisely called Nazca flight and that's the plate started pushing against the Latin American today and do you know what happens when one plate pushes against other one there is some kind of compression along a paper he just starts rising and that rises Anders and of course you own him your own outs because Africa is pushing against Europe and Himalayas Rose because India keeps pushing against Asia and all those things are being have been happening on on the scale of kilometers or indeed thousands of kilometers yeah and depending on how we manufacture these things for example if it's really humanly contrived designed it is called origami at the other hand it's randomly produced by Nature you can record crumpling and in between there is this really important sort of Elemental phenomenon of buckling which we shall come back to at the end of the tour and the challenge is can you actually extract science out of all this all this mess for example here you think you are seeing a photograph you know that looks like a crumpled sheet of paper well for the good reason that this is actually a photograph of example sheet of paper but what is that what is it that we are seeing you see if you ask an artist to draw a crumpled sheet of paper you realize that actually it's extremely difficult to find another artist who can Leonardo da Vinci I know couldn't do it very few people can because it's very difficult to draw a crumpled sheet of paper you see it's not enough to take a sheet of paper and draw a network because a randomly drawn network is not cannot arise as a result of complicated paper there's already this story about the alternating sum being zero but even if you satisfy that that's kind of a perfect classification around each vertex but of course the interesting point is when you have multiple vertices multiple points that are talking to one another via lines and then there's an interesting mysterious interaction that nobody has really studied so among all the embedded graphs or if you like you know networks are drawn a sheet of paper there's a tiny tiny minority which can arise by crumpling a sheet of paper and flattening what is it well we who have lived in this universe long enough I have lived probably longer than most of you and you know can actually recognize it immediately but we haven't been able to verbalize this I mean nobody has so what is it that we know which we can't express that's the challenge okay well next person do you recognize him he's third is famous perhaps in the popular imagination than the previous two but if you study mathematical Sciences at some point you keep running into a meal that's equation for some distribution for some bracket was on this person that now he also left a contribution in what is called the theory of elasticity and my purpose today is to teach you how for all remind you half of the theory of elasticity in 45 seconds here we go so take a block of material and you squeeze it in One Direction what do you think happens right of course it's going to baljat in the transverse remaining directions yeah how much he bulged out per how much you squeezed in that ratio is called poisson ratio to be precise you take the derivative okay differential coefficient o equivalently you can pull the material stretch it and then of course it's going to tuck in its belly how much it compressed in the transverse Direction per how much you put that that's the same thing okay so bulge over squeeze now for such a simple and important characteristic of the material effect effectively it characterizes the transverse response of the material to compression of Direction yeah for such an important concept the notation in the literature is a mess I mean nobody I mean there are so many different symbols and so forth for example you'll see that London I'm going to sight in a moment and denoted by Sigma some people who should know better call it pi oh my God and if I should mean something else or P Lambda Lambda is terrible because it should be a direct constant and so on there is absolutely no consensus on how to denote personal ratio now after many years of living with me um my wife Lisa Willis finally finally found a god-given or rather Lisa given notation for the poisson ratio poisson ratio henceforth should be denoted by this Alpha without thoughts in 200 years time I would like the history of science to remember Lisa Willis as the person who finally discovered the correct motivation for personal ratio now let's train our intuition if you take that losing shape so those black dots are supposed to be hinges universal joints and then those bluish lines are supposed to be rigid rods okay and if you compress that along the blue lines blue arrows of course you see that it's going to bulge out along the Red Arrows that's a response of poisson and the person ratio is directly to be positive and you can already assemble that simple thing into a structure and you have a mesh pattern and that is very interesting because you know if you have tissue with that kind of mesh pattern and make that say a dress or something it has a property that if you stretch in One Direction it hurts the body behind the shapes very nicely and so forth you can do the same thing with fundamental domains unit cells which are hexagonal and then you have honeycomb and so on so on and all of that is positive to be honest the question ratio varies a lot from structured structure from material to material but there is a very common belief that the traditionally it's been believed that personal ratio should be always positive after all it's kind of absurd to think of material which upon being compressed sort of you know becomes smaller in the other direction as well when you pull it bothers you that and that seems to be wrong there's some kind of some Dynamic stability program there too mind you there are actually structures which seem to have almost zero plus some ratio for example if you take a string and you compress it lengthwise it doesn't look like it's bulging out in the transverse Direction but if you look very very carefully actually it's becoming a factor so it's almost zero but nonetheless it is strictly speaking positive it's this belief that person ratio should be positive is supported by the best of authorities for example this is randomly prominent Russian physicist wrote together with his student this is a Monumental 10 volume series course of theoretical physics and and he I don't know why I'm putting the French Edition but because I'm business and that was my for my test you see this a cartoon picture of Landau preaching to his students that he's has a halo around his head and has angel wings and he's telling truth about physics and his students all happening so in the volume seven which is devoted Theory whether that's the series there's a footnote which I shall translate as we got there in fact the question ratio varies only between 0 and one half so certainly positive zero and one half we don't know of anybody in nature for which Sigma That's The annotation for personal ratio but do you know a better notation for personal reasons okay should be negative that is which will bulge out while being stretched okay well faced with such great authorities and common sense it's inevitable that you know we should be tempted to try to design negative personal materials and in fact when you start looking for negative percent ratio it's actually quite a one point for example instead of taking as a unit cell a hexagonal pattern as we took before let's take a hexagon but a dented version of hexagon and concave version hexagon on that yeah and you can no doubt see that if I compress it along the blue arrows it's going to respond by shrinking along the Red Arrows that's negative visual Behavior you can assemble them into a pattern and it's already an interesting structure you can also have other ideas you think that these are just squares that are stuck together but they're hinged in a strange pattern here you see when you start pulling any of the two points apart those squares turn left right left right in alternation they all dance together and then expand nicely and that's negative person two you can do it with a strike your patterns and their 3D versions too 3D versions are actually quite subtle okay so the truth of the matter is not that the personal ratio is between zero and one half this is for isotropic material that is it doesn't depend on Direction all directions look the same it will come to anisotropic case later and it's isotopic materials it's actually not between zero and one half but minus one and one half the upper limit one-half has a very clean physical interpretation it's the incompressible limit not be confused with the incomprehensible limit so what it means is that if you have a material which doesn't want to change its volume that's income free incompressible thank you very much well and if you squeeze it in One Direction by one book well there are two remaining directions right in that space so it has to expand back one half and one half you know the compensate for minus one okay in case you're wondering why I'm taking the choice because Trace is the derivative of the determinant okay never mind so that's so in dimension D to be one over D minus one okay the lowering it lower bound one minus one also has a feasible interpretation and that is the unshareable limit do you know what shearing means take a deck of cars like that and it's a rectangle and put your palms at the bottom on the top and while keeping them parallel just slide them like this that's going to deform the rectangular deck of cards into parallelogram that's called shearing okay and it turns out when the negative proportion ratio is negative shearing becomes harder and harder and that comes from a very simple and Theorem of mathematics which says that any Square Matrix can be decomposed as written as a product of orthogonometrics and symmetric Matrix and if you like this is the generalization if you have learned about complex numbers that any complex number can be written as e to I Theta times some R so ETI Theta is a rotation that's also going to part and R is the dissertation by some Factor that's the symmetric part but much better to see all of that in pictures so forget what I said just simply take that brown Square let's say that you want to share it into that blue paragraph you can do it in Two Steps step number one you take that brown square and you expand it along the diagonal along the right and it contracts it along the anti-diagonal along the blue to make it into the Los Angeles rhombus and having made that you just rotate by a small angle stock into place and that result up to Infinity era is the same as the result of Shear yeah so you can do it in two steps but the first step this one becomes really hard when the poisson is negative because when you extract it along with the red it wants to stretch also along the blue and it resists your effort yeah and at minus one it becomes absolutely impossible that's y minus one for absolute number two is the lower limit okay with that under our belts let's go on to this person that's Mr he is still alive with us and he's a Japanese aeronautical engineer in the 1970s he made invented a very beautiful origami pattern or the mural which you'll see there now I'm going to show you a mirror for reals you know how annoying it is to fold a road map a map I just I just said something but I realized many of you are very young you know Maps used to be made of paper you know this I mean it wasn't something you swept it was actually a sheet of it I know it's unbelievable but it was actually a sheet of paper with pictures and and letters written on this yeah and you try to open this as you are driving from say Oxford Birmingham yeah why would you but you do and on the road you want to know where you're going and then you open this that's fine but when you try to close it it never never folded back poorly and it started so crazy in the wrong places making holes and so and next thing you know your car is in a tree because you're no longer driving and that's because this standard way of folding a map had too many degrees of freedom but here is mirony here's a map you should like a sheet of paper and you know to fold it back all you have to do is to take any two points and just make them come closer together and it collapses automatically in one way yeah there's no degree of freedom but one so I can just push these together I can push these together it's very very easy there's only one and it's Contracting in all directions at once that's this negative person okay so this property that somehow it's negative person and it has very few degrees of freedom that leads only and they are very intimative related there's another sort of property which is hyperbolistic which I'm not going to mention about this okay I mentioned that the uh Mr Miller was an analytical engineer and the indeed in 1997 the Japanese decided putting orbit a satellite artificial satellite you know one of the biggest challenges the most annoying challenges of a satellite is what to do with the solar panels or unpair NS these must be very very large in order to receive plenty of sunlight or you know have much enough resolution with the communication with the Earth but when you put it in orbit you have to you know taste them inside a small small place inside the rocket right and once you know that you want to expand it but you know after you have folded into such a small space and once you know of it you want to expand it you know what's going to happen you start opening it and all the hinges go three three click and they get stuck and you have lost you know maybe um billion pounds that's because it just got stuck there are so many failure points so the Japanese decided to design this folding pattern immediately and then when you open open it in orbit it's mathematically impossible to get stuck because there's only one degree reference all you have to do is to grab two points and just pull them apart and go some food just opens up automatically and if I mean you are interested in closing it you can just push them together and then close it back together so that has been tried okay now so far I have been mostly talking about isotropic so Direction independent properties but now I'm going to discuss one or two direction dependence and purposes of the materials so here is a an experiment I'll try to show you that excuse me you don't want to see my face and so I shall hiven those two squares were cut out from a single sheet of paper on my desk that they call no money in Paris and a single sheet of paper so these are twins if you like they come from the same material made of the same paper yeah and if I put them together and and serve them on one Edge and and then pull them in space like that they sag a little bit and they suck exactly in the same manner because they are exactly the same material yeah they come from the same sheet of paper so they respond the same way and the gravity they said so they stick together of course because they're striking the same way no surprise but now when I turn them over they separate on one side they stick together on the other side they separate they come from the same sheet of paper you know those two squares but that's not the only one only surprise this is the separating side and the other side was the Sticky Side yes now keeping that them on the separating side I'm going to migrate the the clamp on the next Edge and hold it this was the separate inside a moment ago but this time if I support them on this Edge they stay stuck and the other side which used to be a sticky side now becomes the separate inside so that is good very good so because I'm I'm very fond of toys this is a toy but I brought a toy of a toy this is the secondary toy if you um make a square and it fold it an accordion pattern like this this accordion has a wonderful property that in One Direction it is very very flexible but in other direction it's completely Rich it's already that actually I can support the weight yeah it's completely Rich And for those of you who are interested the fact that they're increased in One Direction means that if you try to bend in the other direction it produces some non-zero gaussian curvature which paper doesn't like I'll come back to that okay so this is a way of rigidifying a sheet of paper or any membrane just by creasing okay so what I did when I had in front of me that sheet of paper is very simple staple has some anisotropy that is directly Independence because living in a fibers are running this way and that way who knows that because the malfacturing method of paper after all however I cannot see this microscopic structure because I don't have a microscope but it doesn't matter I just shut out two sheets of paper like so and when I assemble them I turned one against the other by 90 degrees because then look what happens if I support them like that what is rigid is supporting underneath what is flabby above so they stick together but when I turn over they separate yeah and when I migrate to the other side the next side the sticky side and separating such exchange the rules so I didn't know what the microscopic structure was like I couldn't see it but by playing the microscopic structure one against itself I elicited extracted a microscopic response that I liked okay so this is kind of a magical trick which gets the mattress response from microscopic structure without knowing what the microscopic structure looks like okay so this is how it was done by the way I showed this to my friend Steve Childress of Grant Institute and he does the new New York Times puzzle and crosswords by the way he does it on paper too I know newspapers used to be made of paper too yeah and she says that when he takes that he wants to keep some crossword puzzle you try to share it with with his hand and One Direction is much easier to tear than others so I wanted to repeat that experiment and here it is in the long history of your August institution it's probably the first time that public lecturer brings in toilet paper into the lecture and yeah I harvest this over there a moment ago so if I try to tear it lengthwise it's very very easy it goes really strict but if I try to pair it sideways I'm trying to do it very very carefully but actually it's basically impossible to tear it um straight it goes all over the place excuse me yeah it's really a mess and that is a manifestation of microscopic anisotropy of paper by the way I can't help think pointing out at Oxford University at mathematical Andrew Wells Building the toilet paper and tears very easily lengthwise but sideways it's impossible it's something to think about okay so let's now make a detour it's actually a final video through a very very contemporary geometry it's really the day before yesterday yes a strange question take a sphere by the way you might know that the mathematicians like the modern mathematician like to distinguish between sphere and ball when the mathematician talks about sphere it's you almost always a spherical shell yeah there's nothing inside this hollow it's just a shell and the bowl is the stuff inside together so that's called the solid ball if you like so this is the spiritual shell two-dimensional shell sitting inside of 3D can you if you like a big pimple ball can you put that kind of sphere into a smaller space like that the answer is yes you just crush it ah without crushing that is without changing length along the surface yeah that's called isometrically can you do it without changing anything and the answer should be no because you see after all when you try to make something smaller you must start bending it yes and when you think like that you create a crater and the region of the creator has what is called gaussian curvature zero whereas the gas and coverage of a sphere is one over radius squared and so you change the gaussian curvature which cannot be because that's not an isometric isometric operation if you like there is a way of measuring curvature yeah which you learn in University in the second year or so and which prevents you from doing this yeah because whatever is isometry I measure and so confirm length preserving has to preserve the curvature so it's impossible it's prohibited by curvature but then another funny thought occurred which is that okay so if you again learn about curvature you'll see that there is a formula for the curvature and you have to have the second derivative you know it differentiate once you differentiate twice and you combine these second derivatives and that's the formula for curvature what if we try to do this isometric embedding as we call of a large thing into a small thing with surfaces that have only one derivative first derivative what do I mean well it's not smooth enough it can be differentiated once but not twice because then what's going to happen is that Professor Royale is going to come and say well actually you can't do this isometric Amendment because coverage gets in the way and they say what curvature you kind of calculate it because you have one we have only one derivative not two that sounds like really kind of you know peopling but in fact this is one of the basis for the great work by national group of deafness in a beautiful mind and for embedding isometrically allows thinking the small thing and that's used in only first derivative but with that surface switch it's kind of smooth but not too smooth okay and more recently there was an existential proof um theoretically but a French team and Tiber and already and so on they were based at that time I think in Uno but actually implemented this and found that I expressed the algorithm that puts a large sphere into a small space and it was a really Concrete Construction because they made a model out of concrete you see so you this is a halfway model as you can see but they did was to actually what they do is to twist the sphere and as you twist it develops all those corrugations wave patterns but if you look very closely at each of the correlations that's the line there's more correlations and more corrugation this is the next step pattern all the way down to the infinite testicle yeah and when we've already came and showed me this I said ah I have seen this summer before that's the twist version of neura so I shall show you what that is a sheet of paper all my demos start with the phrase take a sheet of paper and two cans a cylinders and I'm going to roll up this in those cans and roll up sorry roll the paper around those cans but while leaving a little bit of gap between those guns okay so I wrote them very carefully and having wrote them tightly I twist one corner against the other and then squeeze and when they're open I see a rather beautiful pattern that is produced here yeah and this there's a lot of geometry you know the pattern and so forth but but all of that is determined by only one dimensional parameter which is the gap between those scans divided by the diameter there's nothing left and this is terrible because while I'm sort of squeezing there's a lot of physics going on here some functional being minimized and what not but at the end when you squash there's only geometry left that's very very typical yeah but anyway at the end you see this pattern and that is very much like the pattern that we saw there and for a good reason I think because what did I do I put I trapped between those two hands a little bit paper and I told nature well you have to go into a much tighter space yeah put it in a smaller space and nature really doesn't want to do it but if he has to do it he wants to do it as isometrically as it can yeah because you know not the isometric it costs the energy so that was the Nature's response the how to put the large thing into a small thing as isometric as yeah so you know these are wonderful imaginative and intelligent people but we didn't have to ask them to do this we could have asked nature to do it so I'm proposing that this is something called H principle you could do actually a physical version based principle okay now another thing that I wanted to share before moving on is something that is related so this is actually um a beautiful thing that I learned from alcohol who's I think David outblock who's no longer here but he's probably retired at Oxford and it's called a momotanic carpet and this particular one actually I folded on a long long flight between London and Cape Town I used to go to Cape Town to work at the Ames some of you know and also at the nursery school which I helped the found and run for hiv-positive babies in Islam next to Cape Town so it used to be a very very long flag between London and Cape Town and 14 hours or something like that but the uh so one day I learned this from outbox so I decided to fold it I started from a large sheet of paper about a year large and then as soon as I got on the airplane I started folding with my neighbor was rather worried about this and yeah and so of course I didn't vote for 14 hours maybe for maybe 90 minutes or less because it's just the replicative pattern or something but the at the end of the day and there's some coffee staying here and what happened what was produces the so I pull this Watch What Happens whoop whoop whoop whoop and on the other side something dual is happening whoop whoop and that is very beautiful but that's the oh well you see this is maybe from a single sheet of paper is not particularly elastic right let me just in fact when I pull and the release it actually has it's bouncy yeah um like like a spring so it is a way of putting effective elasticity into a sheet of paper it's probably quite interesting so that's it for the momentum carpet which was invented by another Japanese engineer called the momotani a long time ago but there is another story about this which is that the I mean at Stanford I have a very close friend um prakash and it is and he recently had a very very sort of that sort of hospitalization experience and he almost died fortunately he survived but he said that in hospital they had to put a tube down his esophagus his throat and that was extremely sort of unpleasant he said so we started talking in the hospital and I thought well you'd be nice not necessarily this one but something that has negative personal ratio you see it has negative personal ratio because when the pool expanding all directions yeah something negative person ratio if I wrap it around into a cylinder like this into a tube oops sorry like that this would have the funny property that you see when you compress this tube lengthwise it expands the opposite of what an ordinary material would do afterward all the material when compressive comes fatter when you pull it comes thinner right but it's the opposite so if you could make of course that not that particular one but if you could make a negative for some Cube then you can push it down your esophagus and because it seems going to be in compression it will shrink and it will be very thin I need to go down smoothly and once you reach the top of the stomach you just tug and that's going to be intentional food it's expands and hugs the inside of your exothers that would be a nice thing to do and there are some other sort of applications to maybe design stands and your arteries and so forth okay so it's time to now summarize some of these things in a theoretical version so here's a typical photograph of a murali you know they simplified discussion let's say that each rhombus in other words all the edges have the same length I can do it in general but this will simplify the formulas well a miraori in any state it's characterized by two angles one of the angles shows its geometry at the other angle shows its Dynamics if you like geometry is represented by Alpha that's the angle in the corner of each face so if I mean outside it's almost 90 degrees each face is almost a square if Alpha is small it means that each face is long and thin okay so that's just the shape Theta on the other hand is the angle between two adjacent faces neighboring faces yeah so if Theta is almost 180 degrees that means that I have stretched out the mirror already almost flat and if Theta is suppose that means that I have compressed it then okay so that's right so any sort of neurality and in any state is characterized those two angles and in that state it's not too difficult to compute the question ratio that's what it is it's one minus something that is larger than one if you know anything about science it's one of a sine that PSI so that's so it's going to be a negative number and by playing with Alpha and Theta those angles I can actually hit any negative number whatsoever as the percent ratio now you're going to object wait wait what about that theorem that I told you about which is the lower bound is -1 that was the isotropic case yeah this is anisotropically it's very very much Direction dependent so that's allowed okay so you see it's interesting a single mirrority in a certain step will present represent any negative number as the negative percent ratio but there's more I mentioned earlier Buckley but you know what buckling is you take a rod and then you just compress the ends and if the load is very light the road contracts elastically just shortens but when you put the critical the rod can't take it anymore boom it Popples out very large deflection sideways and that's what buckling and oil and people and study this but that's a one-dimensional thing what about the two-dimensional buckwheel what I mean is you take a membrane and at each point of the membrane you apply a homogeneous and isotopic compression how do you do that it's actually quite difficult because if you start pushing the edge The Edge effect becomes very noisy and so forth so you might have to use moisture you might have to use family whatever it is but you do the compression and for very weak compression the whole membrane shrinks in its own plane that's fine but that's some critical load the membrane can't take a terminal and boom but was out into the third dimension and that buckling pattern turns out to being rude so again Mr muta extremely imaginative and intelligent person but we could have asked nature to invent this fault so far from being us just an example Mira only is actually the simplest and the universal model of negative personal ratio at this stage actually I realized something you see there is a much much easier way of producing native person racial Behavior so far we have been very clever and very hard working try this try that we study this and and invested in that but there is a much much easier way of doing it take a sheet of paper and just sample it and when I pull it out you expands in all directions that's negative for soon isn't it now those of you who are very careful will say that well bird's eye view will show me any question but if you look at this sideways when a crumple you actually picked on them so that's not negative person but I'm going to counter this for any sort of allowable error Epsilon I can actually do this in a gap within Epsilon by increasing the wave number I feel like that by having lots of creases So quantitatively within Epsilon error for any artificial Epsilon I can do this in a negative person I should be happy and of course if this matter because some because I made it that way I trampled in all directions so of course when I expanded the expanse in all directions at the same time and look this looks really random right as random as human can be and of course each point as I said you know earlier satisfies this mysterious alternate some zero condition what not and you know the rest of it is kind of unknown to science at this moment but you know it looks very random and it's negative by construction and on the whole statistically and on the last scale it is you know homogeneous and isotropic so this leads me to avoid the conjecture which is in both phase by the way you know you know until recently people thought negative person Behavior didn't exist and if it did it was very very freakish and artificial but far from it it might be that if in this universe you take arbitrary and random structure you might have with high probability in the majority of cases negative force on racial Behavior and the reason is that this is really a prototype of of the neck of a of random structure right example sheet of paper and that has negative personal ratio negative percentage okay it's time to wrap this up and you know the we scientists uh as well as the general public alike have the impression that science takes place mathematics included in a very very specialized context um you know you might go to a lecture and do some Professor haranging you and then okay but when the examination is over you close the book and you go out of the room and the Institute is closed and you go on holiday science ceases to exist yeah that's the impression we have so science is something special that we do in some context to show off to have money and so forth and that happens in Labs institutes and you know on the internet and in the libraries you who are looking for information and of course nowadays you know you have to apply for Grant research grants and in order to do so you have to you know draft Cutting Edge proposals saying that we are going to achieve this upload to achieve that and so forth and so on all of these are supremely important because that's where we expect science to come from obviously and on the industry scale as a matter of organizational Society we have to do this but I guess all this background you are perfectly Justified to ask Tadashi why are you playing with paper yeah as in Geisler an answer I'd like to um share with you a little red passage of Aristotle In this passage which comes from the party Busan Mario and this is preservative philosophers so the collection 22a9 and Aristotle is telling a story about heracritos um so this is the heraculators who was one of the presocratic philosophers if you like natural philosophy yeah about 600 BC and he was you know a science style of the time yeah so equivalent of a professor mathematics at Oxford University nowadays and so in at one one day two young people wanted to come see heracritos Aristotle tells and those people obviously expected to see a science star typical stereotype you know probably somebody wearing a lab coat and a long beard and you know sitting at the super computer console and coding with huge sort of uh sort of distributed and programming and so forth and all maybe lecturing to a thousand people or you know running a lab where everyone has his place and sort of you know hundreds of people experiment on something or other and so this was what they expected heraculators to be but when they arrived and so herak didn't they found a completely different person from what they were expecting okay this is Aristotle speaking and my free translation from Greek they in all natural things there is something of the marvelous there is a story that some visitors once wish to meet Heracles but when they entered and saw him in the kitchen warming himself at the stove and playing with children they hesitated is this I mean woman himself at the stove and playing with children of all people but the hero Academia said come in don't be afraid they are Gods even here it's been a great pleasure and privilege to address this wonderful company especially I would like to thank Professor Keating professor bradson professor traffic and Professor Boya and all my friends for their very kind invitations thank you very much [Applause]",

    "originBody": "Johan wrote this @ 2024-02-28 Care My tech posts often come from kind of a negative place. I wish it wasn’t like that, but we all know how the mind works: writing with nuance and positivity is a lot harder than fired-up screeds of the “someone is wrong on the Internet” variety. I do try to check myself. I know that people come from all kinds of situations and codebases, everyone is doing their best given the conditions they’re in, and there really is no One True Way to write code. I will at least always try to give a good sense of how I’d prefer things be done instead, rather than just pointing at something and saying it’s bad. But I think there’s another reason why I come across as negative or angry. And as always with these things it’s hard to tell if I’m just jaded and ossified from having spent my entire adult life touching keyboards, or if it has real merit: I feel like the web used to work better. Not in the sense of features or flagship sites—web-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher quality than ever. I’m not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise. But if I were to estimate some rough median of “how well do websites work” I would also say that there’s an incredible amount of jank out there. My father called me in exasperation last night after trying and failing to book a plane ticket. I find myself having to go over to their house and do things like switch browsers, open private windows, occasionally even open up the Web Inspector to fiddle with the markup, and I hate every second of it. I’ve trained myself out of using the Back button and opening things in new windows, and I will often close and restart order flows rather than try to go back and edit something I messed up. And I just… WHY. Why is it so hard? Your web browser is an amazing piece of software. Give it an HTML page and it’ll render and lay it out in milliseconds, and if you let it do what it wants to do (follow a link when it’s clicked, submit a form with a button, populate input fields, etc) it’ll just work like everyone expects it to. I think that’s where most of my pathos comes from: I have a lived experience from the Before Times when things were just pages and forms, and it turns out pages and forms get you very, very far. I’m a web developer, so I know that the number one cause of jank and breakage is another developer having messed with the browser’s default way of doing things. I can usually figure out what has been tampered with and work around it. But normal people can’t. They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it would! If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do! I could absolutely write cheerier, more charitable and uplifting tech posts. Everything doesn’t have to be an aggressive “do better” response to something or someone. But I assure you those posts come from a place of genuine concern: much of the modern web makes me sad and I feel like I’m screaming into the wind. Every broken contact form or booking site is a truly spectacular own-goal. If your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button, you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support calls from frustrated octogenarians. And it’s hard for me to shut up about that. I care. I really do. That’s why I’m mad sometimes.",

    "commentBody": "Care (hal.se)218 points by herbertl 9 hours agohidepastfavorite60 comments orng 1 minute agoI think part of the problem is that there seems to be a widespread sentiment among software developers to prioritize our time above the user's. Ease of development trumps ease of use and features are made to be easy, or rather fast, to build rather than easy to use and performant. As a young developer I was taught to take the extra time to make things better for the user. Even if it might mean spending two days on a feature rather than a few hours, the cumulative time saved would end up much more than the extra time I spent since users use your software more often than you write it and there are many users. Unfortunately this view is not widespread enough. reply crooked-v 8 hours agoprevI feel like a lot of the problems with web UX come from browsers never natively implementing even basic functionality needed for many web apps, like comboboxes, menus, tab panels, etc. Then there's the endless layers of fiddly work needed to make accessibility work cross-platform (check out all the work Adobe puts into the react-aria project for an example), and that there's still fundamentally no browser-native no-JS way to submit a form and use the response without loading the whole page again... reply lkrubner 8 hours agoparentAgreed. I remember in 2012 we joked that if you used enough Javascript you could get the Web in 2012 up to the level that VisualBasic 1.0 offered back in 1991. But we were certain that in 10 years, by 2022, we'd up to the level offered by VisualBasic 6.0, which would have been amazing, because VisualBasic 6.0 had been amazing. I've been stunned by the lack of progress. The major browser companies/projects have largely stopped innovating. The period from 1993 to maybe 2010 or 2015 was very fluid, and HTML and CSS expanded quickly, but after a certain point the attitude seemed to be \"We don't need to fix HTML because we can fix it with Javascript.\" Which is sort of true, but it is clunky. It would be much better to simply add more to HTML. At a minimum, every form element offered by VisualBasic should have eventually been added to HTML. What is the hold up? Why isn't this happening? It's shocking, but there are still no calendars in HTML. Every calendar has to be custom built with CSS and Javascript. You'd think in the year 2024 we'd have every possible time element added to HTML, with easy customization options. I'm baffled this hasn't happened yet. What will it take to get the major browser companies/projects to start adding more to HTML? reply marcus_holmes 5 hours agorootparentI think Web Components was seen as the fix for this; that (in the same way VB4 did) we'd have packages of standard components as building blocks for UIs. So rather than each browser implementing a calendar defined in HTML, you'd use a third-party library Web Component that implemented a calendar. Which is happening. You can get a Web Component calendar, and they mostly work. I just don't think it's taking off as \"the way\" for doing web UI (yet). This might change, I guess. But probably not. I think the big difference from the VB days is design. In the old days, we dev monkeys would design UIs by slapping together controls in a form. Which is why they all looked the same, and while they worked well they didn't exactly inspire. Now in Web Dev we have designers as the first step, and every designer designs their UI differently. You can't slap together a UI and call it done. Well, you can, and I do, but everyone thinks the result is ugly and needs a designer to make it usable - we've moved the bar of acceptable aesthetics to the point where this VB way of creating UIs doesn't work any more. reply smaudet 5 hours agorootparentYou hit the nail on the head (well, half) - design is an incredibly tricky problem. Mostly because it at its core is the process of adding constraints, and once you've added those its far harder to un-add them. That's why CSS was so janky for so long - there were design paradigms (tables, box model, flex box, etc) and once they were there, you hoped they worked and you hoped that your specific design didn't break one of its core assumptions, leading to large amounts of work-around code that was either slow or exhibited constant random bugs in different versions of browsers... The other half of the nail was backwards compatibility. Unfortunately you can't have web components and your stuff working on 20 year old devices. So any new design/paradigm etc. served to splinter the ecosystem (your stuff only works on this browser, that device, our operating system). Graceful degradation sort-of would have provided a work around, but it would have done so by shifting the workload onto the provider (please make sure your calendar works, in these browser, and also has fallback implementations as a clock that doesn't break your back-end code because they entered hours as farsi, test on on these 40 browsers and also target moving backends). So instead we invented polyfills as a way of \"automatically\" back-filling for a lot of stuff. Unfortunately, you can't do much about the Web Component calendar. The design paradigm that once existed doesn't support it without a lot of busy work, even if newer browsers could natively implement one and never load a line of javascript or any of your shitty thousand line long html layout code... I don't think its a completely lost cause, HTMX + Web Components seems like our best path forward so far. Right now, a lot of people who've written millions of lines in non-html frameworks like React and the like are very reluctant to give up their codebase(s), however terrible they might be. It is unfortunately, the result of someone somewhere making a design decision that added constraints, now causing headaches and difficulties un-adding those constraints... reply yen223 7 hours agorootparentprev> What is the hold up? Why isn't this happening? One of the problems, and arguably one of its strengths, with the modern web is that there's no single \"entity\" that owns everything. A large part of why this isn't happening is that there are too many parties involved in the web - browser implementers, standards maintainers, and web developers. If you want to introduce a new feature to the web standard, it's not enough to convince one browser implementer to add it - web devs can't use a feature that only one browser supports! You need to convince the standards body to adopt it, and to convince browser implementers (plural) to support it, and this takes a lot of time and coordination effort. In the case of Visual Basic, you just need to get some PM in Microsoft to add it, and it'll be added. reply actionfromafar 1 hour agorootparentIs it Apple and Google? reply freeone3000 8 hours agorootparentprevInput type=“date” was added and is supported in HTML5, no js required. Same with time! reply crooked-v 7 hours agorootparent...which is great as long as you don't need a calendar on the page itself, or a calendar that shows two months instead of one, or a calendar where you can display information on dates or block selection of certain dates, or a calendar you can add any CSS styling to, or... you get the idea. reply clipsy 7 hours agorootparentWhat browser do you use? You can test `input type=\"date\"` here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/in... -- I've tested every up-to-date browser I have on my laptop and phone and they all display a proper calendar-style date picker. reply wild_egg 7 hours agorootparent_date picker_, yes. Calendar display? No native options. The person you're replying to is talking about displaying event data to users which always requires building custom components or pulling in libraries which do reply bombcar 6 hours agorootparentWhich is hilarious because it can display a calendar for date picking; but cannot display a calendar. reply smaudet 5 hours agorootparentLikely because the element authors didn't want to overload the existing input semantics. You are talking aboutnot . Its the same semantic issue that lead toand , with different functionality/support in different browser(s), and why we have auto-fill libraries that eventually became javascript component libraries, got rolled into development frameworks and turned into hyper-adware... Its \"hilarious\" but an \"input\" that does nothing but show an input calendar is arguably better. Otherwise, you're not writing (semantic) html, you're writing . reply hawski 1 hour agoparentprevRegarding a form submission without a reload I got this idea years ago: If the page that is loading has the same origin as the page before it the browser would do the equivalent of DOM diffing and replacement. Basically doing what those new batch of JS libraries did in browser. reply Zak 5 hours agoparentprev> no browser-native no-JS way to submit a form and use the response without loading the whole page again I think a lot of badness comes out of the desire to avoid loading the whole page again. Sure, there are lots of more desktop-like webapps where that's definitely undesirable, but a whole lot of interactions are just fine as a page load, as long as the page load itself doesn't suck. reply _factor 4 hours agorootparentThe real problem isn’t the page load, it’s that it’s visible. If only one picture and a bit of text update, why does the whole screen have to blink? reply zarathustreal 8 hours agoparentprev“And use the response” Right, because a description of the use of the response would constitute a DSL reply lmm 6 hours agoparentprev> I feel like a lot of the problems with web UX come from browsers never natively implementing even basic functionality needed for many web apps, like comboboxes, menus, tab panels, etc. This is completely backwards IMO. The problems come from browsers natively implementing all of these things, in ways that are almost, but not quite, good enough for those web apps. The browser has the Python standard library problem of being \"where modules go to die\", but even worse since browsers can never deprecate anything; as a result we have all these 80% implementations that don't quite solve the problem but are enough to suck all the oxygen away from any good solutions. And then we just pile hacks on hacks to improve these things without ever fixing the underlying stuff. I mean FFS, Chrome will save and sync passwords that I enter in some web form flow based on heuristics, but it won't save actual username/passwords that I enter via the built-in username/password functionality that the browser has; how screwed up is that? If I was somehow king of the web, what I'd be looking to do is: standardise one of the various \"web components\" proposals that lets people implement custom tags as libraries. Reimplement almost all of the things that are currently implemented as browser builtins as web components instead, move them out of the core rendering engine and into what are effectively polyfills-in-reverse; make the actual \"browser\" piece only implement div/span/canvas or something. Normalise pages loading components from libraries, where they can be iterated on and improved more quickly. But for some reason web folks and especially HN seem to hate the few parts of the web technology stack that actually work well (Javascript, NPM) and love implementing as much as possible in the parts that are awful and unfixable (CSS). So I don't see things ever improving. reply crq-yml 6 hours agorootparentThe elephant in the room is that the majority of the standards we end up with are the same thing done three or more different ways in a great rush by a bunch of industry players, with the most popular one being sufficient for a demo app, and the rest being unknown and NIH'd out of parlance. What we've managed to seriously agree on: * 8-bit bytes * IEEE 754 * Unicode Still up for grabs to a motivated dissenter: * Endianness * Line endings * 3D coordinate systems * Structured data encoding * Networking protocols * Calendars * Everything else The browser does work and do some useful things. At the same time, it is mostly a defacto-standard in the post-Chromium era. Specifications like Web Audio did not appear through a lengthy process like, e.g., what created MIDI 2.0. A team at Google appointed themselves a rubber stamp for the thing they wanted to do. But if you actually want to implement it, you look at what Chromium did. These days I go with the assumption that most of our interfaces are not seriously standardized, and starting over is correct once you have an application that really needs control. reply smaudet 3 hours agorootparentprev> But for some reason web folks and especially HN seem to hate the few parts of the web technology stack that actually work well (Javascript, NPM) Actually, the parts that are \"awful\" and \"unfixable\" work great. You still need a DOM to render anything whether its CSS or JS. Without all the parts that make a browser, well, a browser (that you seem to hate), you have a glorified JS engine. But maybe you are a guy who likes doing everything in their own custom graphics engine, you can have your canvas and javascript-based UI (ew, hard pass) and render everything like molasses except on 24 core monster desktops... > Reimplement almost all of the things that are currently implemented as browser builtins as web components instead, move them out of the core rendering engine and into what are effectively polyfills-in-reverse; make the actual \"browser\" piece only implement div/span/canvas or something There's no reason to do that last part, and in fact its really terrible news for not just compatibility but also any sort of accessibility. I guess you don't care about blind, disabled people, or people in different markets, 24 core video game guy... or maybe you do and you'll re-implement the browser...in your browser! What a great idea... Now, as far as web components go, we should have default impls of nearly everything. You can, and probably should, have some ability to customize the render of individual elements (what web components brings to the table). But you don't get to change default behavior _because you feel like it_. There's no point to writing web-apps otherwise. You are far better off just writing in a \"native\" language where you have full control anyways. reply TehShrike 8 hours agoprevOne of the top things that I want in a job is coworkers who care obsessively. reply serf 7 hours agoparentit's a double-edged sword. I want balance rather than obsession. reply sndean 8 hours agoparentprevEspecially if you're working as team. Caring obsessively can be a negative in some competitive environments, e.g., a very insular/non-collaborative university department. But I suppose I might not call those other professors coworkers. reply irjustin 8 hours agoparentprev> One of the top things that I want in a job is coworkers who care obsessively. While I agree with the premise, the \"downstream\" really matters though. There's a lot of different ways to care obsessively and many are quite toxic if you've ever worked with them. One example comes to mind is I've been there were PR comments are way overbearing. There's definitely good points/notes, but nitpicking, snide comments, holier-than-art attitude easily comes along with the boat. \"With love\" is such a blase statement, but it really has to be the starting point. That caring combined with respect has to be present to be a healthy, long term working environment. Like with many things, there's a balance. reply jaggederest 7 hours agorootparentI'm going to plug my PR log level policy here: I add a tag to my PRs asking for \"error level\" or \"debug level\" or whatever in between. Then the reviewer can tune their feedback. I started doing this when I was working with a diverse group of folks with different backgrounds. I'd like it to be a standard thing. I find that I want different kinds of feedback through the process of developing a PR, and whether it's over a day or a month matters a lot too. That way, I can safely be obsessive about things when giving PR feedback, in the knowledge they're asking for \"debug level\" feedback, or give it just-the-facts review if they're just trying to get something merged that has been reviewed to hell and back. reply Retr0id 7 hours agoparentprevs/obsessively/pragmatically/ reply jjtheblunt 8 hours agoparentprevThat’s such a great observation reply roenxi 8 hours agoparentprevWell, y'know. You're likely to be better off if you put that desire to one side and focus within. Consider a soup kitchen vs a supermarket checkout. The people working at the soup kitchen arguably care a lot more. The person at the supermarket checkout can be as glassy eyed as they feel and still be part of feeding more people in absolute terms. Humans seem to have some sort of emotional heuristic to focus on care (really, focus on motivation of others I think). That works in small groups but it is highly misleading in large ones. In large groups, the only factors that matter are incentives and competence. If the incentives are good and the people are competent, good results will happen. If the reverse, corruption. The motivation heuristic actually does a lot of harm because it causes a huge amount of noise in the discourse where people whinge about this person or that having bad character to no avail. It is often true that people have impure motivations, but at scale that is true of effectively everyone. There are the devils you know and the devils waiting to become known. We can get great outcomes regardless; our politicians are cut from the same cloth as the Nazi and Communist parties but look at the difference in outcomes. One of the most peaceful insights I ever stumbled across was that of the people in the workplace who cared less than me, there were a significant and productive subset who were just doing more good than me through competence and being thoughtful about what work to pick up. reply ozr 8 hours agorootparentI've been on large and small teams of people that cared and didn't care. It feels noble and reasonable and right to tie it to a greater purpose; like your soup kitchen vs supermarket example. It's not that type of care the OP is getting at. It's closer to a craftmanship kind of care. Being proud of what you're putting into the world. Caring that it works well, not because the purpose is important, but because it's something you're doing and you want to do it well. reply roenxi 7 hours agorootparentIf someone wants high personal standards then ok, that'll be good for them in the long term. But if we're talking about colleagues that care then that is just a cover for bad management. And fair enough bad management is endemic in the software industry so teams pick up the slack. But it is management's job to decide on software quality standards and provide feedback to devs. Expecting the developers to be responsible for quality as a baseline is just a path to burnout for those devs; because then they are going to go mad because everyone on the team has different personal standards. The person with the highest standards on the team will never be satisfied. You can't reasonably expect teammates to cover for bad managers, it is much cleverer to learn to identify good managers and try to work for them. Or become one. reply patch_cable 8 hours agorootparentprevHow would you describe the difference between thoughtful and caring? reply roenxi 7 hours agorootparentMaybe I'd pick on an auditor as an example. They need to think about whether people are doing what they say they do. They don't need to care about what they are doing. To me, caring means expecting work to be done to your standards instead of an independent standard. reply chime 8 hours agoprevWeb and modern tech can be fantastic if you take away the dark patterns.

It’s slightly amusing seeing hacker news bringing the magnifying glass trying to look for which JavaScript framework to blame when the boogeyman is standing right in front of them: it was meant to be this way, largely. It’s a pure function of the parameters given to the developers by their employers and clients. JS hell is just collateral damage. I mean… try to turn off the adblocker for a bit. And don’t look at the address bar. Now this is hard: but pretend you can’t tell ads and clickbait apart from the content. Also, pretend you don’t know that websites are sandboxed and that they can helpfully warn you about “problems with your computer”. Now you’re somewhat close to the experience of an average user.

It doesn't. Its supposed to come from your operating costs (cost of living + insurance costs).

A fairly nasty one, and I feel the need to atone. No excuses. I just don’t do that, anymore. My formula tends to be specific, in praise (and as much of that, as possible), and vague, in criticism (and as little of that, as possible). It does earn me some sneers, from this crowd, but I’m really too long in the tooth, to be ruled by personal insecurities. I continue to do it, and the occasional insult won’t stop me, or provoke me into retaliating. I’m a pretty good coder. I write code every day, and just about everything I write, ships.

If a technology structurally encourages shooting oneself in the foot, people will shoot themselves in the feet. The author seems to be arguing the the core problem is behavior — if only developers would stop building flimsy things! But what about a structural view? Is there a certain structure that lends HTML, CSS, and JS to creating frustrating experiences? The structural heart of this problem is so big it's hard to see — it's the ground we stand on. The designed-by-committee dissonance between \"the Web should be a simple document engine\" and \"the Web should be a game-engine-like interactive graphical runtime\" leaves us with a bloated tech stack that doesn't excel at either.

The fact that a tool enables you to shoot yourself in the foot is never an excuse to shoot yourself in the foot. Knowing how not to shoot yourself in the foot with a powerful tool is one thing that separates amateurs from professionals, and you get to be a professional by caring.

Similar to how LLMs have enabled products that completely circumvent crap in search results (e.g. low quality listicles), we will see the same happen for most products and services. Some products are going to be tough to displace, and it might take a new airplane startup that owns the entire ticket purchasing to inflight entertainment and last mile transportation (airport to destination) to show the world what an incredible flying experience could look like, that will force other airlines to at least try and catch up.

Nah. If you did that progressive enhancement nonsense it would take 3x as long and would still work less well. Frankly the biggest thing holding back the web is the opposite, people keep trying to use the broken and awful browser widgets and technologies instead of declaring bankruptcy and just rendering their system via one big canvas element like you would if you were writing a program in a real programming language.

You'd have to implement so much functionality that we take for granted (selecting text, copy & paste, accessibility, keyboard shortcuts, etc.). If you don't want to do it yourself, you have to use a widget library or some kind of UI kit. Maybe like Flutter. The web-version of a Flutter app renders everything to canvas (with a lot of caveats). Since people bring their own UI libs for their JS-CSS-HTML web apps all the time, they will probably do the same with a pure canvas implementation and the result would be even shittier, because half of them will forget basic functionality. reply d--b 5 hours agoprevThis is utter bullshit.

    "originBody": "Energy Giant 'sand battery' holds a week's heat for a whole town By Michael Irving March 12, 2024 Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn Giant 'sand battery' holds a week's heat for a whole town Polar Night Energy is building a new \"sand battery\" Depositphotos View 2 Images 1/2 Polar Night Energy is building a new \"sand battery\" Depositphotos 2/2 Polar Night Energy's previous sand battery has been running since 2022 Polar Night Energy A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to 100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than a pilot plant that’s been running since 2022. The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a clever concept. Basically, it’s a big steel silo of sand (or a similar solid material) that’s warmed up through a heat exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity from the grid – say, that generated during a spike from renewable sources, when it’s cheap. That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat itself. In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into the local district heating system, which shares heat produced from industry or energy production through the community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the district heating system of the Finnish municipality of Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan Lämpö. Polar Night Energy's previous sand battery has been running since 2022 Polar Night Energy This new sand battery is expected to stand 13 m (42.7 ft) tall and 15 m (49.2 ft) wide, providing an output power of 1 MW and a capacity of 100 MWh. That, the companies claim, equates to a week’s worth of Pornainen’s heat demands in winter, or a month’s worth in summer. By comparison, Polar Night’s previous sand battery stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft), for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity of 8 MWh. The new battery should also reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the district heating system by 160 tonnes per year, translating to an almost 70% reduction. The sand itself will also be sustainably sourced – it’ll consist of crushed soapstone, which is a manufacturing byproduct of another local industry. This material can apparently conduct heat even better than regular old sand. While sand batteries might not find wide outside of areas that use district heating, they could still be one useful tool in a climate change toolbox that needs to be as diverse as possible. Sand batteries might join other grid-scale storage options like lithium-ion, gravity, molten salt, iron-air or flow batteries. Polar Night Energy says the new sand battery will complete construction and testing in about 13 months. Source: Polar Night Energy",

Put a heating element and a simple oven thermostat on the bottom. Fill with sand. Connect to a solar panel or other enrgy source. The air between the sand particles seem to actually provide a bit of convection and insulation. The thermostat turns the circuit off before getting too hot for the heating element. The heat accumulated during the day is slowly released over time directly through the metal. reply kiney 7 hours agorootparentThats just a regular storage heater... reply immibis 8 hours agorootparentprevAny system that involves an electrical solar panel connected to a low-temperature electrical heater is likely to be better served with a solar hot water panel, by about a 10:1 ratio. reply Retric 5 hours agorootparentMore like 4.5:1 solar is 20% or so efficient and solar thermal is only like 90% when including losses. Anyway, the real question here costs both in equipment and labor. Solar hot water panels involve plumbing and need radiators etc they quickly pay for themselves when heating a large home but don’t scale down very well. Running the numbers I was surprised how cost competitive the sand bucket is for something like a chicken coop. Sure the panel(s) are wasted most of the year, but you don’t exactly need an electrician to set this up either. Probably also worth considering for redundancy in some situations. reply slow_typist 4 hours agorootparentThe monetary case of PV does not account for the damage that is done to the environment over the entire lifecycle. Solar hot water panels are ecologically superior. Not only are they more efficient in W/sqm. Their production is not as energy intensive (plumbing included), the recycling process is less complex, poisonous materials can mostly be avoided. If heat is the desired product, they probably beat PV by an order of magnitude in the energetic dimension. reply bb123 1 hour agorootparentprevBut this would stop you getting the sand hotter than 100c - which is one of the main advantages of using sand over water for heat storage. reply kgabis 12 minutes agorootparentYou can make it work under pressure and/or add salt. reply mercutio2 6 hours agorootparentprevAre you including the maintenance costs of the water panel in your estimate? I used to buy this argument, but then: A) PV panels got ridiculously cheap B) everyone I know with solar hot water has emptied their systems because the maintenance hassles were not worth dealing with Using high grade intermittent current to produce resistive heat isn’t high on my list of efficient things to do, but unfortunately neither is maintaining hot water panels. reply defrost 5 hours agorootparentMight be a location thing; there are vast numbers of solar hot water systems here in W.Australia and typical maintainence is maybe just replace the tank outright and flush the lines every 20 years or so.

But I can't help but think of one \"technology\" that could make a scheme like this MUCH more effective. a phase change. for example, it takes 1 calorie for water to go from 30 to 31 degrees F, but but it take 80 calories to go from solid at 32 to liquid at 32 F. A project I remember reading about that was really interesting was a house constructed with logs that had a resin that phase changed around room temperature. The idea was that the logs would be heated by sunlight, and the resin in the logs would absorb lots of energy without easily going above room temperature. Then at night, they would slowly solidify and give off heat at room temperature. This would be a cool way to stabilize house temperatures without needing equipment. EDIT: it was called the enertia house I'm uncertain of the history, it seems there are a lot of different \"enertia house\" search hits. Here's one explaining the idea: https://enertia.net/howitworks.html reply usrusr 4 hours agoparentPhase change heat storage is well established techology. It's in the product you buy when you want to have building scale latent heat storage. I've even seen a company trying their luck at the business model of selling heat in twenty foot equivalents, e.g. for building sites. So it's safe to assume that they knew about this option. But there's also the square-cube-law, at some point it will be cheaper to insulate a larger volume of the cheaper material than a smaller volume of a material that requires less volume per unit of energy at the heat range you aim at. It's well possible that this line is between building-scale and grid-scale storage. reply isolli 44 minutes agoparentprevThe Venera probes used this idea in the 1970s.

Waste material costs over €100/ton to dispose of across most of the EU. So therefore this material costs less than nothing! That's why the project doesn't use water (which has a 4x higher heat capacity and can be pumped allowing the heat exchangers to be far smaller and eliminating the 'temperature decreases as it discharges' problem). reply yetihehe 3 hours agorootparentprevFor construction you need a special kind of sand (still pretty common on average). For this battery you can use sand unusable for construction. reply jillesvangurp 1 hour agorootparentprev> The sand itself will also be sustainably sourced – it’ll consist of crushed soapstone, which is a manufacturing byproduct of another local industry. The requirement is not really construction grade sand but any substance with a largish thermal mass. Sand/dirt/crushed rock, etc. whatever you have right on your doorstep. There have been plenty of prototypes using such various materials as thermal mass. All you need is a big container, some insulation to keep the heat in and lots of mass in whatever form. And some pipes to get heat in and out via e.g. water. The bigger the container, the smaller its surface area is relative to its volume. So these things can be quite efficient. If you make them large enough, you can store enough energy in the summer to last for months during the winter. Here's a story about a Dutch retiree who built a prototype using basalt as the thermal mass in his backyard: https://deepresource.wordpress.com/2020/03/08/cesar-seasonal...

There is a small community of eco housing that uses this system, in Boekel. They use solar panels in summer to heat the battery which lasts all winter. On a diy scale, there is also this system for passive greenhouse called a climate battery which uses the same principle, storing heat underground and using it in winter. With almost zero energy we can use it to grow bananas in a greenhouse in the Netherlands. reply kumarvvr 2 hours agorootparentprevSand used for construction should not have salt content.

But yeah, something like a phase changing fluid (gasliquid) will probably work well, as it does in air conditioners right now. reply foofie 3 hours agoparentprev> But I can't help but think of one \"technology\" that could make a scheme like this MUCH more effective. I think this is one of those things that drive home the point that there are fundamental differences between physics and engineering. The article states that the thermal silos are heated with excess energy from the power grid. This alone tells you right from the start that efficiency is not the primary requirement. Sand is inert, doesn't decompose or degrade, is readily available, is easy to work with, and has no moving parts. You can make it work in a silo, or digging a well to fill it with sand. In fact, geothermal heat pumps are already used extensively in residential buildings to regulate temperature. You just have to drill a hole in the ground that's deep enough, run a water pipe through it to heat/cool the water, and run that water through your building to heat/cool the environment. The nifty trick of Polar Night Energy is that they introduce the extra step of actively heating the thermal source with cheap energy supplied by the electrical power grid. This sort of argument is like complaining that a Formula 1 car is far more efficient than a Volkswagen Golf. Yes it is,but that's a mute point. reply standardUser 2 hours agorootparentI can't endorse this perspective enough. The amount of energy storage we need is staggering and ever-growing. We've someone convinced ourselves that the 'baseline' is consuming with abandon millennia worth of stored energy and anything even slightly less responsive than that is too inconvenient. Given those parameters, we need any and all energy storage options and efficiency is not a priority. Tesla powerwalls were never going to power the world, but giant caverns full of sand might. reply heyalexej 7 hours agoprevHere's a smaller scale water battery that heats an entire house year round.

Even better, unlike a sand battery, you can potentially cycle it for several months of summer, by offsetting consumption by just a few hours feels like it could be economically viable.

It's already viable for stadiums and other public events. reply bumby 8 hours agorootparentThis has been around for a long time. The Detroit VA hospital used it, I believe with tanks under the parking structure. I also believe there were problems related to the maintenance of the tanks. But the important aspect is that this is a cost saving technique, not an energy saving one. You’ll spend more energy because of the thermal losses of the tanks, but hopefully it is more than offset by the cheaper electricity rate. reply dragontamer 6 hours agorootparentEnergy is (sometimes) free, or even negative priced (!!!!). As it turns out: it's economically infeasible to turn off solar panels, wind, nuclear and sometimes Hydro (depending on water rights, it may be illegal to store water/energy at a water dam). In all of these cases, the energy is 0 cost or even negative cost. reply Danieru 5 hours agorootparentYou're confused, negative prices are not driven by techincal limitations. Solar, and especially hydro, and even nuclear can shut down just fine. Solar and Wind instead drive prices negative because they have subsidized contracts. Each country is slightly different in implementation, between Feed-in-Tarif vs Feed-in-Premium. In either method there will exist prices which are negative to the market but positive to the producer. Thus if you cannot plan long term to rely on negative prices. Those FIT schemes around the world are transforming into FIP, and the FIP premiums are getting lower and lower. Negative pricing in electricity markets will go away in a decade or two. This isn't magic or even special, solar is succeeding which means the subsidies are getting weakened. Curtailing solar production is not a big deal. How many existing plants have grid operator directed shutoffs depends on your market. In Japan as of 2024 all new non-rooftop solar has it. Prior to 2020ish only Kyushu and Kansai regions required it. Now Tepco, Hokkaido, and Touhoku require it for new contracts. There are still a couple old contracted plants getting developed this year, but those are rarities. And that's only Japan, which itself does not have a super strong duck curve yet: http://jepx.org/ Regions like California have had extreme duck curves for ages. While duck curves are a big worry for internet commentors, they've been points of discussion for grid operators are a lot longer. Hence the move to Feed in Premiums which will slowly make the duck curve a solar operator's problem and not a tragedy of the commons situation. reply taneq 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you’re using renewable energy that would otherwise go to waste for lack of storage, then that’s definitely saving (useful) energy. reply llm_trw 8 hours agorootparentprevJust because something seems like should work doesn't mean it will.

The other day we had a warm sunny spring day (5C / 40F), so I opened all the windows and did some spring cleaning. I set the thermostat to 16C as I didn't want the heating coming on while I was doing this. I forgot about this, and the next day when I woke up wondered why the temperature in the house was only 20.5C (68F) as usually we have it set to 22C (72F) - then I remembered I effectively turned off the heating 18 hours ago, and forgot to turn it back on. reply bicebird 9 hours agoprevI was thinking of ways to get around the peak solar generation being when you don't need it for heating and genuinely really heartening to hear about solutions like this. The article doesn't mention the costs or complexity in building each unit but definitely implies it's cheaper than storing it batteries, which makes sense if it's essentially a heating element buried in sand. Wonder what the smallest viable size would be, could you have one for each street / block of flats? One of the comments mentions burying them for better insulation which I'm assuming they didn't want to do just for the prototypes? reply llm_trw 9 hours agoparent>The article doesn't mention the costs or complexity in building each unit but definitely implies it's cheaper than storing it batteries, which makes sense if it's essentially a heating element buried in sand. Batteries are more expensive than nuclear power so yes, anything else is better. The issue is that we can't both electrify everything and use legacy heating applications. Going back the the 20th century idea of central heating/cooling is great until you realize the costs involved with adding all the plumbing to buildings which were never designed with it in mind. reply noqc 7 hours agoparentprevPeak solar is peak A/C usage in the summer, which is typically more expensive than heating. In colder times more energy is used at night, but I think less energy is still used at night in the winter than in the day in summer. reply Newlaptop 4 hours agorootparentUsing the term \"energy\" here is suboptimal because it's mixing grid electricity with gas power. A/C tends to be powered from electrical grid. Heat is often from propane or fracked gas. More energy overall is used to heat homes in cold climates, but cooling homes in hot climates creates the challenging grid demand. reply fbdab103 6 hours agorootparentprevThat does not seem right. A hot day in summer might be 35C->20C (95F->68F). Winter is going to be more like -10C->20C (15F->68F) twice the temperature gradient to overcome. reply noqc 2 hours agorootparentYou could be right, insulation is a lot more effective at keeping houses warm than cold though (greenhouse effect) and heat pumps can dump their waste heat inside. reply lstodd 4 hours agorootparentprevThat does not seem right. -10С to +20C .. I can't even think of a place with such a swing.

My bad. Still, if you got this kind of temperature gradients, and I happen to have lived in such a place, you also got at least 100mm mineral wool insulation or eqivalent. Which is poor by the way, and people do invest into 200 or sometimes 300mm. Which makes CO2 and moisture control more of a problem than heating. You basically either heat the outside via ventilation anyway, or invest into heat exchangers.

It's specifically intended to store surplus energy from renewables for later use. reply froddd 2 hours agoprevThe fact I find most fascinating is that they have a local district heating system reusing heat produced from local industry. That’s efficiency on another level. reply apexalpha 51 minutes agoparentI think that's pretty common, no? Here in NL our district heat comes from a chemical refinery a few clicks away. For them the heat is an annoying waste product. reply latchkey 3 hours agoprevGood buddy of mine in Vietnam has been working on a company around this as well: https://www.alterno.group/ reply photonbucket 10 hours agoprevI'm curious about \"why sand\", is it better at holding heat than say water? reply ben_bai 9 hours agoparentIt's more effective volume wise. I did the math, some time ago here are the rough numbers. Sand has way less heat capacity then water per kg (about half). Water can be heated to 95C with standard unpressurized vessel. Sand in this application is heated to 600C. Sand is denser then water (kg/m3). For the same heat energy stored this comes out to about 2.5x more volume of water(95C) compared to sand(600C). Water and Sand are both dirt-cheap. Hot water can be managed with standard plumbing equipment. Sand needs some high temperature piping (hot air to water heat-exchanger, resistive heat tho heat up the sand). How well both contain the heat is primarily dependent on the isolation. Which favors the smaller footprint of sand, but needs to isolate a higher temperature difference... reply tjmc 9 hours agorootparentOne advantage of heating water over sand is that you can heat it up with high temperature heat pumps which currently have CoPs ranging between 2.4 to 5.8 [1]. So for every kW of electrical energy you put in you get at least 2.4kW of thermal energy out. So yes, the volume of 95C water would be much greater than that of 600C sand, but if volume wasn't an issue you could do it much more efficiently. Alternatively, you could use battery storage for just the electrical capacity required and not the (much higher) thermal capacity which may be more cost effective when you look at the conversion. [1] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S03605... reply shellfishgene 8 hours agorootparentprevThe temperature also matters. If you need at least 50 C water to run district heating, about half of the energy stored in near boiling water cannot be utilized. This is much less with 600 C sand. reply Ekaros 39 minutes agorootparentAnd 50C is too low. That is minimum temperature of the heated tap water(Legionella and other diseases). And preferably you want some higher. And then as distance increases there are losses and other people using the heat. So temperature you need is actually quite high and in very cold days can be over 100C... reply Ekaros 1 hour agoparentprevNote here is also that district heating uses water that is heated to 65-115C. Which means that you have rather little of delta to work with. And at upper end it becomes somewhat risky to have large container of water that is beyond boiling in normal pressure... With sand you can use very simple heat-exchangers. No need to use exotic heat pumps that require extra energy... reply pfdietz 9 hours agoparentprevSand is cheap, and stays stable up to 1200 C or so. For conversion back to work the efficiency will be much higher than for lower temperature water. reply dragontamer 10 hours agoparentprevProbably not. But sand doesn't freeze (or perhaps, sand doesn't melt) under normal temperatures. That's probably more important for an icy region. reply tonyarkles 8 hours agorootparentProbably not relevant to the specific problem at hand because sand that's getting heated to 600 degrees is going to quickly boil off any residual moisture. As a warning, though, so that people don't experience the pain I got to experience, a pile of sand is really good at holding onto water internally and freezing when it gets cold. We had to replace our sewer line a while back and for various reasons were taking care of filling the hole and redoing the concrete ourselves. The sand guys left a big pile in the driveway for us and as soon as winter came the whole pile turned into a single giant rock despite having been out in the hot sun previously. Exactly to your point, though, one of the great things about using sand for this application instead of water is that you can probably just shut the thing off for maintenance without having to worry about draining all of the sand out. If it freezes up due a bit of residual moisture content it's not going to expand nearly the same way that a silo full of water would, and it should be easy enough to thaw out just by putting some heat into it. reply fghorow 9 hours agoparentprevNo advective heat transport in sand. In tanks of water, on the other hand... That means that the hot middle of a sand pile stays hot, instead of advecting to the outside, where it cools by conduction. reply christkv 10 hours agoparentprevCan store a lot more heat by volume. Water has other bad properties. The higher the temperature the higher the pressure. reply Terr_ 10 hours agorootparent> [Sand] Can store a lot more heat by volume. A quick caveat/clarification: It's only true if you're pushing the system over the 100°C mark. Otherwise a volume of liquid water--with its greater latent heat-capacity--will outclass the same volume of sand. Water's heat-capacity is 4.186 J/g°C, while estimates for sand run towards ~0.830 J/g°C. If we also assume the sand is 1.6x denser, then our below-boiling water still comes out ahead at ~3.15x the joules per volume. There are hints [0] this system tops out around 600°C.

Is that just speculation or did you read it somewhere? IIRC the original motivation of PNE was a bunch of engineers at uni speculating on how to build the perfect building for engineers, and making it self-sufficient would require handling its own heating, which they originally thought would be best done with a big hot-water tank to store the heat. No turbine was suggested, IIRC. reply christkv 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah see that but i imagine the safety engineering is a fair bit easier due to not having to worry about the pressure of super heated water. reply Waterluvian 10 hours agoparentprevIt’s probably less likely to turn into gas, increase in pressure, and explode the silo. reply SuperNinKenDo 10 hours agoparentprevIn addition to what others have said, isn't one of the weird properties of water that it tends to take in energy easily, but not give it back so easily? I've never really understood how that works, but I think I've leqrned that at some stage. Hence why it's used in cooling so much. Somebody jump in and tell me how wrong I am, or if I'm on a track that doesn't lead completely nowhere. reply candiodari 9 hours agorootparentWater vaporizes, and at that point blows up just about every container you can build around it. As will ice when it cools down. Sand is just sand, very little difference, very unreactive from way under freezing temps to about 1300 degrees.

In Europe a 100 year old building is shockingly common. And they are still in use. Mostly because even back then (some) housing was already build in a lasting manner. And not being able/willing to tear them down gives you a baselevel of sustainability. The other thing is that we used up most of \"our\" fossil energy reserves decades ago and what we want to burn today requires imports, which requires a reasonably stable world economy, a reasonably strong geopolitical position and ... well ... even the last conservative governments have woken up, that those assumptions may not be true any longer reply Gigachad 8 hours agoparentprevLess politically radicalised maybe? America should have all the tech and resources required to pull this stuff off, but it just doesn’t happen. reply yurishimo 2 hours agorootparentIt's mostly centered around cost. Fuel (of all types) is so cheap in the US that efficiency was not an ultra high priority for most people. Ironically, the US has now gotten extremely competent at drilling for natural gas and the price is going to stay pretty much fixed where it is for the next 50+ years. Most of the waste from the early days has also been reduced and funneled into new petrochemical production processes that used to be reliant on oil. If you are going to stay in one place for a long time, renewable solutions to problems like hot water and residential electricity are worth the investment, but with the migratory nature of the US worker, it's often cheaper for a household to pay for fuel for 5~ years rather than invest in a renewable solution that they will never reap the monetary benefits from. From what I've experienced since moving from the US to Europe in 2022, it's a lot more common for people to stay in the same houses for an extended period of time. Especially here where I live in the Netherlands, you can commute to work almost anywhere in the country in about 2 hours by car. This allows people to keep the family home. reply komali2 7 hours agoparentprevEurope is more politically progressive (in some ways) than the USA, and sustainability is a progressive standpoint. Political identity politics in the USA means that even if you have a ranch in rural Texas and are directly observing the negative effects of fracking on your local environment, you still support the people that are trying to make more of that happen because if you don't, well, you must hate pickup trucks and beer and Christians too (drawing on personal experience as a Texan). I've poked around on this topic here and there when bored and never found many good explanations for why this is the case. Probably a million weird little reasons, historical, economic, cultural. IMO the country is just too damn big to try to claim a single cultural identity, and it's resulted in absurd caricatures of polarized political identity, fostered as well by a two party system where it's basically impossible to be represented well per your values. In the USA you can't vote for someone that's promoting reducing government spending without also voting for someone that's attacking trans people's right to exist, or at least in the same party as such a person. Or someone that's trying to take away your wife's healthcare rights. Same way you can't vote for reducing oil dependence without also voting for, idk, taking everyone's guns away. reply at_a_remove 7 hours agoprevI've been obsessed, mildly, with Feolite. It could be brought back for these sorts of applications to great effect. It's got the volumetric heat capacity of water and the ability to withstand much greater temperatures without any annoying phase transitions. It was very popular in the UK, where they went in early on charging for electricity on a rate varying by hour. The basic formula is easy, but there's a lot of secret ingredients to get the heat capacity way, way up. Speaking of home uses and phase transitions, they have made inroads into making materials with a phase transitioned tuned to household temperatures. Say you have aimed for seventy-two Fahrenheit. The temperature gets higher than that? The material melts, absorbing ambient heat. Then, as the temperature dips below seventy-two Fahrenheit, it freezes, releasing heat. It would make a fantastic sort of \"heat capacitor,\" designed to deal with rapid, small-scale temperature fluctuations, while larger heat batteries could deal with fluctuations over days, weeks, and so on. Only problem is that these phase transition materials tend to be terrifyingly flammable, so far.

They're also using the term \"reasoning\" which is... new. Can you call this an AI wrapper company? Kinda! The medium is a little different than an app, of course. Lots of amazing applications of AI even if frontier AI development froze today. reply jaffee 18 hours agoparent> text to servo movement yeah this was super impressive. If this is at the point where you can put an arbitrary object in front of it and ask it to move it somewhere, that's going to be huge for industrial automation type stuff I'd imagine. I do wonder how much of that demo was pre-baked/trained though. Could they repeat the same thing with a banana? What if the table was more cluttered? What if there were two people in the frame? reply archermarks 17 hours agorootparentKnowing as many people in the robotics space as I do, I suspect the demo may not be completely \"pre-baked\" but it is almost certaintly highly selected. Often they'll try the demo many many times until they get a clean run-through without mistakes. The circumstances are also likely pretty idealized, like they pick objects and settings that they know it performs well in. reply mvkel 16 hours agorootparentInteresting! This would sort of explain the low energy of the human demonstrator in the video \"Take 488... action!\" reply mvkel 17 hours agorootparentprevGreat question.

What strikes me as amazing is the speed with which it is performing tasks that require dexterity. This is the first object manipulation robot demo I have seen that didn't require speeding up the video for it to look \"natural\". reply darth_avocado 15 hours agoparentI am 100% convinced that the demo is partly fabricated, or at least very far from the robot’s capabilities. The inference part was probably true, but the dexterity would put them waaaaay ahead of what robots are capable of, if not programmed finely for a specific task. Industrial robots obviously have that kind of dexterity and precision because they’re specifically programmed for a task. General purpose robots however are nowhere as close to this level of accuracy or fluidity in their movements. reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentIt is. Have you seen ok robot? https://ok-robot.github.io/ reply binoct 13 hours agorootparentOK-Robot is super impressive, but there is a huge difference in the manipulation ability OK-Robot shows with a simple 1-DOF gripper and parallel-axis arm to pick up objects and place them largely on flat surfaces, and the human-analog arms and fingers of Figure 01 picking up a plate in both hands and placing it in the right slot in a drying rack, or dropping the apple into a person's moving hand. It would be absolutely amazing if they really are at that level of manipulation in general, and it would put them vastly beyond what anyone has been able to do date. However robotics demos have a great history of being a mix of slight of hand (partial/full tele-op), heavily cherry picked, or tuned to a extremely specific example. Because it's such a leap being implied by this video, it's reasonable to want significantly more evidence before believing they can do this type of interaction and manipulation in a general way. But even if it is heavily leaning say on imitation learning for this exact scenario, there are tons of potential applications for this level of capability. reply fragmede 8 hours agorootparentYes, there are two half’s to this. This is being able to understand the command which OK robot shows is possible, and then there’s the control of motors and actuators as you pointed out. Not needing a team of engineers to laboriously write gcode to manipulate motors is part two and is the other astounding thing here. I haven’t been following this sort of thing, so I have no idea what previous state of the art was, so I can’t judge how much of an advancement it really is. reply whatever1 14 hours agorootparentprevProbably some sort of imitation learning reply btbuildem 13 hours agoparentprevThe slightly dismissive nature of the toss seemed like a hack or maybe a deliberate way to speed up the [pick up, carry, drop] pathway. reply StarCyan 14 hours agoparentprevYeah the motion looks way more fluid then similar systems I've seen before. reply huytersd 17 hours agoparentprevHow though. It’s probably just predefined actions that are triggered by the LLM output. At the same time it would be impressive if the LLM determined the right function to call in real time, was able to deal with the ambiguity in placement of the garbage and bonus points if it could do that in a scenario that wasn’t hardcoded to exactly standing behind that table in that spot. reply og_kalu 17 hours agorootparentThe robot movements are separate end-to-end neural networks.

I don’t think it’s intentional. I think there are certain phonetic/tonal linkages that are naturally “weird” (uncommon in the training corpus) and that AI struggle with them.

I argued that ChatGPT indicated that we were not too far away from being able to tell a robot to pick the apples from a particular row and put them in the green barn as the usual red barn was being painted today. This video suggests that I was right, and I in fact suspect that such manual labour is a more realistic type of work for AI (with robots) to substantially replace first than most knowledge work, where I think it will remain as an assistant for some time. reply iamflimflam1 14 hours agoparentI think we are going to find that the Moravec paradox is wrong.

You can sign up and use their Voice Lab for free or maybe a few bucks and experiment with the slider for Stability and the other setting.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread Giant sequoias are a rapidly growing feature of the UK landscape by University College London Redwood Trees at Wakehurst Horsebridge Woods. Credit: Visual Air RBG Kew Imported giant sequoia trees are well adapted to the UK, growing at rates close to their native ranges and capturing large amounts of carbon during their long lives, finds a new study led by UCL researchers with colleagues at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The new research, published in Royal Society Open Science, found that the most massive species of redwood trees, Sequoiadendron giganteum, known as the giant sequoia, can potentially pull an average of 85 kilograms of carbon out of the atmosphere per year. Though introduced to the UK 160 years ago, this is the first time the trees' growth rate and resilience in the UK have been analyzed. There are an estimated half a million redwoods in the UK and more are being planted, partly due to their public appeal. In the wild, they are endangered with fewer than 80,000 giant sequoias remaining in their native California range. Lead author Ross Holland, formerly a Master's student at the UCL Department of Geography and now at East Point Geo, said, \"Giant sequoias are some of the most massive organisms on Earth and in their native range make up some of the most carbon-dense forests in the world due to their great age. We found that UK redwoods are well adapted to the UK and able to capture a large amount of carbon dioxide. We hope that these findings can help guide decisions on future tree planting and management.\" 3D laser scan of a Giant Sequoia. Credit: Mathilda Digby The researchers emphasize that the most effective way to mitigate climate change is by reducing carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. Trees can help by absorbing carbon emissions, but they also provide other important climate, ecosystem and well-being benefits. Giant sequoias grow quickly and are also some of the longest-lived organisms in the world, keeping up their rapid growth throughout their 3,000-plus year lives. They can grow up to 90 meters tall, and while not quite the tallest in the world (that title goes to their closely-related cousin the coastal redwood), their wide trunks grow out, giving them the greatest volumes. In addition, they're fire resistant, able to survive blazes that would wipe out forests of other tree species. The trees grow best in their native range in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, so the researchers wanted to gauge how they fare under UK climates, which are milder and with a wider range of rainfall. They compiled the first dedicated map of giant sequoias in the UK, mapping nearly 5,000 individual known trees. The team visited three groves of trees, located at Wakehurst, the wild botanic garden of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in Sussex, Havering Country Park in Essex, and Benmore Botanical Garden in Scotland. They set up terrestrial laser scanners to map the trees in 3D, enabling them to measure the heights and volumes very accurately and to create 3D models of 97 representative trees. 3D laser scan of two Giant Sequoias. Credit: Mathilda Digby Co-author Dr. Phil Wilkes, formerly of UCL and now at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said, \"Using the latest laser scanning technology has allowed us to accurately 'weigh' these massive trees without having to cut them down. This means we can measure many more trees as well as revisit them in the future.\" The tallest tree they found measured about 180 feet tall (54.87 meters)—giant compared with most native UK species, but dwarfed by their American counterparts. This is in part because of the UK sequoias' youth: the oldest giant sequoias in the UK are those at Benmore, the earliest dating to 1863. Knowing when the trees were planted allowed the team to calculate their average growth rates under the varying climate conditions between the three UK sites. They found that the trees at Kew and Benmore grew at similar rates as their US counterparts, although growing slightly taller and slimmer at Benmore compared to Wakehurst, while at Havering the trees grew more slowly, likely due to less rainfall in the region and competition from dense local woodland. Though giant sequoia stack up well for sequestering carbon, the researchers caution that planting trees requires long-term commitment, and consideration needs to be given to how well they will thrive in the UK's changing climate in the next 160 years and beyond. 3D laser scan of a Giant Sequoia with a green block to represent the height of a person. Credit: Mathilda Digby Senior author, Professor Mat Disney (UCL Geography), said, \"These results give us an important baseline for estimating how well giant sequoias are doing in the UK climate. Currently, these trees are probably more important for their aesthetic and historical interest than they are for solving the climate crisis. But as more are planted we need to know how they will grow. \"The history of these trees in Britain is fascinating—initially as symbols of wealth and power, through to now being widely planted in parks and woodlands. They are iconic, but there is almost no work on how fast they grow or how well they will do in the UK's changing climate. I find it amazing to see these giants dotted across the landscape and see how rapidly they are growing.\" More information: Giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) in the UK: carbon storage potential and growth rates, Royal Society Open Science (2024).

What would be the net benefit of treating it like radioactive waste versus using it as a construction material? Yes, a small percentage of the carbon would escape, but most of it would stay locked up in the wood, and one wouldn't create the massive amounts of CO2 necessary to build and operate those hypothetical mines. reply enriquto 18 hours agorootparent> What would be the net benefit of treating it like radioactive waste versus using it as a construction material? Man, that was just a silly example to illustrate the absurdity of the situation. We are currently unearthing millions of years worth of sequestered carbon per year and dumping it all into the atmosphere. Talking about planting trees is ridiculous at this point. Like pumping water out of the sinking titanic with a champagne glass. If we don't want to increase the amount of carbon in the atmosphere we just need to stop putting it in! reply bcatanzaro 19 hours agorootparentprevGenerally I agree but Sequoiadendron wood is famously unsuitable for construction. It’s brittle and shatters easily. Not the same as Sequoia wood, which is famously wonderful for construction! reply BlueTemplar 17 hours agorootparentprevYou seem to be assuming that the carbon will stay locked in the construction materials. But I doubt that it will, what will happen to it after the building is destroyed ? Either it will have been by fire, or as waste, will likely be back in the atmosphere after wood-eating life is done with it. I wonder how feasible it would be to put wood (from particularly dense species ?) on the bottom of the expanding anoxic ocean zones ? That seems to be one of the rare locations where the only thing that could possibly degrade it are sulphur-\"breathing\" bacteria, which seem to have trouble digesting lignin ? But even here, it might still be easier to just stop burning fossil fuels ? EDIT : ninjaed P.S.: For an opposite example, see how concrete reabsorbs over decades back up to half of the CO2 exhaled during its production. P.P.S.: Supposedly, soil-buried charcoal is also decently stable, I guess even fungi find it unpalatable ?? reply therealdrag0 3 hours agorootparentThe thing is humans build more and more. Any destruction or burning is replaced with more building. So in that sense construction with wood has aligned incentives and is more economical than just burying carbon with is purely a cost. But construction seems unlikely to be sufficient alone. Tho most of the world prefers concrete which is also releases carbon iirc so them switching to wood may help. reply omnibrain 19 hours agorootparentprev> and what, then? When plants die, their matter is decomposed by fungi and all their carbon is released back into the atmosphere (unless the dead plant matter is buried). Why does every measure have to solve the problem? Buying time is just as important. We start mammoth groves now. Buy time for measures that solve the problem and win huge ressources (building wood, recreational space, erosion prevention) for the future. reply mapt 18 hours agorootparentIt's not \"Mammoth groves\" if you want to meaningfully \"buy time\". A grove is an open tree stand a few acres wide. That's not what we're talking about. It's not adding a little bit of tree seed to unused spaces. It's inverting our footprint entirely. It's planting the entirety of the UK, every year, indefinitely. It's employing a few million people with heavy machinery to walk from one side of the planet to the other and bulldoze every farmhouse they find, leaving behind mixed saplings at a wide spacing in the fields. It's just way easier to decarbonize most of our society than it is to spend the land on forest carbon fixation. It's a lot of land, more land than we'd ever agree to dedicate. And I would point out that planting trees and then sequestering that carbon periodically with charcoal production is by far the easiest way. Every other technique is ten or a hundred or a thousand times lower payoff. If you want to slow things down, you have to mostly stop burning fossil fuels. We need to tax the hell out of them, we need to shut down new projects, we need to electrify anything feasible, we need to heavily subsidize and aggressively plan for rapidly scaling renewables. When we're at a 90% reduction in fossil fuel usage, then we can re-assess priorities because we've both \"bought some time\" and eliminated all the low-hanging fruit that's easier than deliberate carbon fixation projects. More likely, we'll keep on steamrolling ahead, and something like sulfur geoengineering will be put forward as a way to stave off the worst effects for a while. reply medstrom 20 hours agorootparentprevI suppose we could do that too, down the line, if we plant trees now. It's at least a method of buying time, but maybe not so reliable. It presumes no one will find a way to cut them down for profit later. So maybe we'd need to add each tree planted to a growing count of trees \"never to be cut\" in the country. reply HPsquared 19 hours agorootparentprevAll the work involved in felling, cutting and manually sequestering the wood sounds like it could be more expensive - and a lot slower and less scalable - than direct air capture.

Other places with similar climate grow tall trees but nearly so high. Is it something about the climate or are forests here just full of highly evolved specimens involved in an arms race? reply OkayPhysicist 16 hours agoparentThere's a couple factors. A big one is that the North American Pacific coast was just one the last places to get significant settlement, so we didn't cut down all the big trees like we did elsewhere. Appalachia, for instance, used to have its share of giant trees. But those trees are still dwarfed by the sequoias. The West Coast's wet-dry spells lead to more forest fires, presenting another evolutionary pressure on tree height. Tall trees put their canopies far enough away from the flames that fires can sweep through the undergrowth without ever reaching them. There's also the fact that we have one of the most mild climates in the world: wild temperature fluctuations cause difficulties in getting water up tall trunks. Finally, there's the fog that keeps the canopies moist. reply dhosek 17 hours agoprevI remember going to Kings Canyon/Sequoia National Park back in the '00s and when we got to the altitude where the sequoia groves existed and I caught a glance of one off to the side, I was so transfixed by how amazing it looked I almost drove off the road. reply huytersd 3 hours agoprevThey live for a thousand years but will never be able to reproduce in the uk? reply physicsguy 14 hours agoprevAt Chatsworth House not far from where I live there's a 'pinetum' (which was a word I'd never heard before) which has quite a few redwoods planted in Victorian times. reply zabzonk 9 hours agoprevIn Edinburgh Botanic Gardens.

I'm not familiar with Nanos internals, but after skimming their FAQ[0] it seems that Nanos is kind of VM that can't run on bare metal and still requires hypervisor (presumably Linux, unless your CTO plays a lot of golf with MS salespeople): Nanos is a single process operating system designed to run as a virtual machine and has no support to run on hardware.

Etc., etc. reply eyberg 4 hours agorootparent> I don't really have a filesystem in the way we know it. This is a rather common misconception. Nanos (and many other unikernel projects) have filesystems.

But running a full multiuser OS with kernel and userland for your one process, adding extra context switches and what have you to everything you do, just for the rare occasions where you log in and run a few commands, seems crazy to me. As long as it can output logs/traces/etc. to a collector (which is what I'd want to do anyway, no-one wants to have to SSH to each separate instance to look at log files on the local filesystem) and there's a way to attach a debugger (e.g. the Java style where your debugger connects to it on a given port), I don't see any advantage from having e.g. a filesystem per se.

Is the IRC channel hosted on libera/oftc/efnet? reply eyberg 7 hours agoparentWe need to remove that. We did have a channel on freenode a while back but got rid of it. Outside of gh discussions there is also https://forums.nanovms.com/. We made a decision a while ago to follow Zig's lead here and have no 'official' community space (https://github.com/ziglang/zig?tab=readme-ov-file#community) instead letting people form their own spaces. reply exceptione 1 hour agorootparentAn 'official' community space is a blessing, I think Zig took the wrong direction here, I can understand why project maintainers don't want to carry the burden of gardening a space, but Zig is not doing itself any favors here. Instead, I would suggest maintainers to open a \"vacancy\" for an accessible and privacy friendly space, and if it fits the criteria, bless it. Or just start one yourself and hand it over. Why? From a quick glance, most of the Zig communities are on discord. That means all folks that value privacy would not participate. And even if you are ok to lose out on that demographic, you still have a highly fractured information space. Although in the case of discord, \"information space\" is too generous. \"Information black hole\" is a more apt term, because none of it gets indexed by search engines. One cannot do without a bit of leadership to make a project successful. ... and props for your project! reply injuly 3 hours agoprevAmazing work. The code looks very neat too.

Genuine question. reply convolvatron 4 hours agorootparentI thought I was going to do is research. There was a consensus at the time in the community and at least one famous white paper that I can’t find now (pike? rashid?) that explained it was dead. I kind of agree and kind of don’t. I think we have more exploring to do on what the right structure is, but I’m not sure I’d call it research. I think we really missed an opportunity to lay down a new foundation with cloud services. Distribution and security are still two pretty massive holes, and people are looking at them. reply quocanh 6 hours agoprev [–] I so very much want this idea but coded in Rust. Alas, I'll have to try this out. reply walterbell 3 hours agoparentRust + WebAssembly unikernel, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37982137 reply munukutla 6 hours agoparentprev [–] Why Rust? reply quocanh 5 hours agorootparent [–] Partly because it's an ecosystem that I'd like to see grow. More people using it means that the other Rust-based projects I use will be better too. Partly because it is the \"carbon fiber\" of programming languages. Just its use is something you can use to market to other engineers. Partly because it's very ergonomic and I enjoy working with it. I'd much rather dive into esoteric Rust code than esoteric C code. Partly because code written in of Rust will have less errors than code written inside of C. It isn't just memory safety - it's all of the type theory/best practices we figured out in the last 50 years. I understand why it was written in C. It's an easier language to work with and they probably needed something out quickly. But coding in Rust is a sign (not proof, but a sign) that a program is of quality make. reply convolvatron 4 hours agorootparent [–] It’s really small. I know c doesn’t translate to rust, but it would be a good template for someone doing that. You need the state in an os, and using threads as memory containers is a bad idea here. But you could certainly do the array thing or arc everything steal the interrupt notion from the embedded rust community, write a different async runtime and that would get you most of the way reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
