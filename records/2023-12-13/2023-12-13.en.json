Pranav Dixit Senior Editor Updated Fri, Dec 8, 2023, 10:24 AM EST·3 min read 0 SOPA Images via Getty Images Genetic testing company 23andMe changed its terms of service to prevent customers from filing class action lawsuits or participating in a jury trial days after reports revealing that attackers accessed personal information of nearly 7 million people — half of the company’s user base — in an October hack. In an email sent to customers earlier this week viewed by Engadget, the company announced that it had made updates to the “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section” of its terms “to include procedures that will encourage a prompt resolution of any disputes and to streamline arbitration proceedings where multiple similar claims are filed.” Clicking through leads customers to the newest version of the company’s terms of service that essentially disallow customers from filing class action lawsuits, something that more people are likely to do now that the scale of the hack is clearer. “To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you and we agree that each party may bring disputes against the other party only in an individual capacity and not as a class action or collective action or class arbitration,” the updated terms say. Notably, 23andMe will automatically opt customers into the new terms unless they specifically inform the company that they disagree by sending an email within 30 days of receiving the firm’s notice. Unless they do that, they “will be deemed to have agreed to the new terms,” the company’s email tells customers. 23andMe did not respond to a request for comment from Engadget. In October, the San Francisco-based genetic testing company headed by Anne Wojcicki announced that hackers had accessed sensitive user information including photos, full names, geographical location, information related to ancestry trees, and even names of related family members. The company said that no genetic material or DNA records were exposed. Days after that attack, the hackers put up profiles of hundreds of thousands of Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people for sale on the internet. But until last week, it wasn’t clear how many people were impacted. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 23andMe said that “multiple class action claims” have already been against the company in both federal and state court in California and state court in Illinois, as well as in Canadian courts. Forbidding people from filing class action lawsuit, as Axios notes, hides information about the proceedings from the public since affected parties typically attempt to resolve disputes with arbitrators in private. Experts, such as Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Nancy Kim, an online contractor expert, told Axios that changing its terms wouldn’t be enough to protect 23andMe in court. The company’s new terms are sparking outrage online. “Wow they first screw up and then they try to screw their users by being shady,” a user who goes by Daniel Arroyo posted on X. “Seems like they’re really trying to cover their asses,” wrote another user called Paul Duke, “and head off lawsuits after announcing hackers got personal data about customers.”",

IANAL, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that a court would not allow that, given that the TOS was changed AFTER the breach and it&#x27;s pretty clear that the company is trying to avoid legal issues after-the-fact.I would expect the court would evaluate any breach under the TOS that was in effect at the time of the breach, rather than under a new (and arguably suspect one) that was put in place after it, arguably in an attempt to \"rewrite history\". reply everforward 16 hours agoparentThey ought to be evaluated as if no TOS exists. Given the clear intent to defraud customers by misrepresenting the contract they were bound by, the claims should be evaluated under the TOS most favorable to the plaintiffs. The most favorable TOS is the one that&#x27;s invalid because 23andMe didn&#x27;t get anyone to actually agree, ergo the claims are evaluated as if no TOS exists.This is an attempt to undermine consumer protection laws, and the government should treat it as a direct attack. Other companies are watching. The government needs to send a clear message that this won&#x27;t be tolerated before it spreads, becomes the status quo, and leaves many consumers believing that they don&#x27;t have any rights or protections.The head of legal should also be disbarred under American Bar Association rule 1.2(d):> (d) A lawyer shall not counsel a client to engage, or assist a client, in conduct that the lawyer knows is criminal or fraudulent, but a lawyer may discuss the legal consequences of any proposed course of conduct with a client and may counsel or assist a client to make a good faith effort to determine the validity, scope, meaning or application of the law.This reads as clear contract fraud in the factum [1]. Customers are told that they&#x27;re bound by new contract terms, despite that 23andMe never got agreement, nor tried to get agreement, nor even know whether customers have read the new contract. I can&#x27;t fathom any other reasonable interpretation of the situation. They created a fraudulent contract hoping to confuse other entrants to prior versions of the contract, and intend to benefit from that confusion. It seems clear to me. They are attempting to undermine the legal system, and the ABA needs to deal out swift punishment as one of the protectors of that system.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fraud_in_the_factum reply blagie 8 hours agorootparent> ABA needs to deal out swift punishment as one of the protectors of that system.This is part of the legal system. It shouldn&#x27;t be, but it is. If you can toss a hundred issues the other party has to refute, you drive up legal costs to where litigation is no longer practical. The other side loses by default of not being able to afford litigation.The ABA is, indeed, one of the protectors of the legal system, and have no vested interested in undermining it. The system means their constituents, lawyers, make more money.Footnote: The mistake you made is that 23andme isn&#x27;t undermining the legal system, but rather, justice. The two are not the same. reply bertil 9 hours agorootparentprevI’m curious if their lawyer has a defense in saying that they advised against it, but were told to try it anyway.I’m even more curious if the change of ToS alone could be grounds for a trial, even a class action—making the risk not even worth the try.Even harder to swallow: discover that the lawyers using the class action got hold of the data from the leak and used that in their marketing. reply underlipton 10 hours agorootparentprevThere should a (modern version of a) letter-writing campaign to pressure the government to take this seriously. The literal core of one&#x27;s being is on the line. reply throwaway092323 17 hours agoparentprevThey probably know that it doesn&#x27;t hold water legally. The hope is to victim blame as much as possible so that fewer people sue them in the first place. The next step will be to \"remind\" people about the TOS that they totally agreed to. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentThis looks like a perfect class action case. There&#x27;s really no physical harm or financial harm to the users, but a class action might be the only way for it to hurt. But IANAL, and probably have it all wrong in my head??? reply underwater 13 hours agorootparentWhy is it that in the US individuals have to band together and privately launch a class action to stop these types of parasitic behaviours. The government is supposed to represent the interests of citizens. reply alistairSH 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s exactly why - we have a largely dysfunctional federal government (and most state governments aren&#x27;t much better).The biggest downside is the lawyers take a massive chunk of any award and the actual victims are often left with very little. Or, even worse, the victims get worthless coupons (like with many credit&#x2F;PII breaches - the award will be 1-year of credit monitoring from the company that allowed the breach in the first place). reply BrandoElFollito 12 hours agorootparentThis credit score system in the US always made me curious. Say some point I had a proposition to move to the US and I asked the company offering the job how they will ensure that I immediately get the best possible score. They said it was not possible because it was a personal score.I told them that I will certainly not start to build a credit score at 40 yo so they will have to find someone else. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sure that as soon as they stopped crying and wiped the tears away from their eyes, they had no problem filling the spot. The question I have, were they crying from laughing so hard at your retort. reply BrandoElFollito 40 minutes agorootparentWhen you come from a place where in order to get a credit the banks look at your finance, job etc. and based on that they give you one or not, the US system is weird to say the least.I am glad you are happy building a credit score and then when your SS number is lost (or some other PII) you have to go through hoops to maintain it. This is a place I do not want to be in. reply carlhjerpe 8 hours agorootparentprevThis seems like the perfect reasoning to build a country upon. The US brain drain was hugely accelerated by WW2 and is in steady decline. Having a system that encourages new people to take out loans&#x2F;credit just to build a score probably doesn&#x27;t make it better, don&#x27;t think that won&#x27;t affect the US economy long term.On a single individuals level it doesn&#x27;t matter ofc, but don&#x27;t be ignorant towards how that might affect your future if you&#x27;re young enough to live through brilliant people leaving. reply listenallyall 7 hours agorootparentprevYou refused a job because the company would not assist you in obtaining a perfect (\"best possible\") credit score?a) nobody has a perfect score b) FICO algorithms are proprietary from third-party companies, how would your potential employer have any influence? reply BrandoElFollito 35 minutes agorootparentYes, and this is when I discovered this system which looks quite crazy to me.I am coming from abroad with experience nedded in a US company (and therefore in the US at large) and I start my finance as if I was 18.Then if there is a problem with my PII I have to worry about why it was lost. The company that lot it is going to give me a year of some kind of monitoring.Well, no. I am not really interested to depend on some proprietary system that can make my life difficult just because someone fucked up. Or go through hoops to build it without consideration of my past outside the US or my job. reply aamoyg 9 hours agorootparentprevI thought our government was dysfunctional on purpose? reply dylan604 3 hours agorootparentworking as intended. won&#x27;t fix.reply wharvle 12 hours agorootparentprev1) Common law versus civil law. We rely a lot more on private lawsuits than on regulator action. This is probably a mistake, given that it sure looks like it adds costs to common law countries with little to no benefit (and, arguably, harm) but it’s what we have.2) The consumer protection laws we do have, and the bodies to enforce them, are relatively weak and enforcement is spotty at best. The most recent serious attempt to kinda fix this is the formation of the CFPB, and one of our two relevant political parties deliberately prevents it from working when they hold the White House (sample size of one, admittedly) and has been trying to totally kill it, in the legislature or (better, because it’s popular and this is deniable) in the courts. reply mistrial9 9 hours agorootparent> consumer protection laws we do have, and the bodies to enforce them, are relatively weakIANL - however, in the US and in US States, many serious cases have been decided in favor of the consumer, over decades. It is the most recent waves of privacy versus ad revenue that are indeed, very weak. It is awkward to defend these regulators since their failures are sometimes glaring, however it is my impression that serious settlements against industry can have silence or \"gag orders\" attached, and they often do. The industry lawyers can argue that the news of the settlement alone constitutes additional commercial damage to the company, and of course they are right in a narrow sense. reply zlg_codes 12 hours agorootparentprev> The government is supposed to represent the interests of citizens.I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s ever happened in this country. They pay all sorts of lip service, but when challenged or under pressure, the US makes a lot of excuses for leaving its own people behind.Thankfully we can repay that favor and see how they like it when there&#x27;s nobody left to defend them. reply listenallyall 8 hours agorootparentWho is \"we\" and \"them\" in your statement? reply losteric 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not true that individuals need to band together. A single individual can kick off a class action lawsuit, private litigators can even kick start a lawsuit themselves (though ultimately the lawsuit will bring in impacted individuals).The idea of private litigators is to complement the innate limitations of federal&#x2F;state lawyers, by offering profit as an incentive.Ideally yeah Americans would have stronger laws around TOS, customer privacy, data handling and security, and robustly funded state lawyers... but we don&#x27;t.Practically speaking, such gaps are not unique to technology. Every industry has this same problem, and your awareness of those problems is reflective of the general public&#x27;s political engagement with this thread&#x27;s topic. So having gaps that private litigators address is really quite normal and part of the incremental progress of legislation and state enforcement. reply dylan604 13 hours agorootparentprevLobbying.

Those stickers on dump trucks that say \"Stay back 200 feet. Not responsible for broken windshields\" are worthless from a legal perspective.They do absolutely nothing to remove liability from the truck driver&#x2F;company. If a rock falls from their truck and cracks your windshield, they absolutely are responsible for any damages.Rather, their sole value is to convince drivers that the trucking companies aren&#x27;t at fault, so that drivers whose vehicles are damaged from falling rocks erroneously elect not to press charges or pursue damages. reply dexterdog 4 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t their sole value to keep most people back far enough so they don&#x27;t get their windshields broken? reply ironick09 6 hours agorootparentprevi’m guessing you have a problem with signs that say “danger, do not enter” as well reply listenallyall 7 hours agorootparentprevSuch a lawsuit, if one was filed, would be in civil court, where nothing is guaranteed. If, in the unlikely case that the suit was not settled and it actually went to jury, no judge would direct that jury that truckers \"absolutely are responsible for any damages.\"If you are tailgating directly behind a rock truck with a big sign \"stay back 200 feet\" for an extended period of time, or end up right behind the truck because you&#x27;re in a big hurry, or because you thought you could squeeze through an empty lane, a good lawyer could absolutely argue, successfully, that you are at least halfway responsible for the damage, if not 100%. reply padjo 14 hours agorootparentprevThe point being that while it’s not at all enforceable there’s a non zero number of people who will think it is and not fight it reply quickthrower2 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat about fallen leaves? reply chihuahua 10 hours agorootparentStraight to jail! reply quickthrower2 9 hours agorootparentOr at least probable cause for a search :-) reply constantly 16 hours agorootparentprevYep. A small tangent for anyone who has seen these: they’re very clearly not specifically enforceable. I got a window banged up by things falling off a truck with this signage, and the first thing they said when I called their “How Am I Driving” number the first thing they said was that they were not responsible citing this sign. Fortunately that sign was non binding. :) reply jstarfish 15 hours agorootparentGeorgia (state) takes it a step further. They wrote an exemption to the license plate law that allows dump truck owners to display the plate only on the front of the vehicle.

But even then the driver is very much responsible for the mud guards on the truck they are operating, just as the police would write a ticket to the driver for worn down tires or broken lights. reply andrei_says_ 9 hours agorootparentBut are they “a punch in the face”-responsible?I lived in Boston for a while. Cracked windshields were extremely common. No one was ever upset at another person. reply squeaky-clean 4 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re missing the joke. If truck drivers could actually put up a sign saying they are not liable for any debris falling from their vehicle, and have it be a valid defense in court. Then they would just put up a sign saying they are not liable for any black eyes given when they see debris falling off a truck.They&#x27;re taking the unrealistic expectation of the truck driver&#x27;s sign protecting them from doing something illegal and flipping it. In other words \"If you coul just put up your own sign and get legal protection to break my windshield, then I could just as easily put up a sign giving me legal protection to break your nose.\" reply sithlord 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is usually related to drivers who do not use the cover of their truck they are legally supposed to.

Also, the practice of having a sticker on a shrink-wrapped box of software that read \"By opening this package you agree to the Terms of Service contained within\", where the TOS was inside the box that you needed to open the package to read, was deemed unenforceable back in the 90&#x27;s. It&#x27;s the reason that TOS&#x27; are now displayed as a pop-up during installation. Not that many more people actually read them before installing the software, but at least they are given the option to.I suspect that a competent lawyer could fairly easily argue that this \"automatic opt-in\" is the same thing in a slightly different format. reply smcl 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more than suspect, what&#x27;s the point of agreeing to a terms of service if they can change after you agree to them? reply huytersd 16 hours agorootparentThey usually put that exact thing into the ToS. The right to change it at any time. reply wongarsu 14 hours agorootparentJust because they write that doesn&#x27;t make it legally enforceable. You can&#x27;t agree to terms you don&#x27;t know.

Especially when the TOS changes were made after an event likely to trigger litigation.This isn&#x27;t a case of a minor change to consumer rights in the TOS like changing who would arbitrate a case. It&#x27;s a significant restrictive change to the rights of the customer in favor of the company. And it was made after a security breach that affected a huge portion of the companies clients which is likely to trigger lawsuits of the form that the TOS now seeks to restrict.This is clearly a case of attempting to close the barn door after the horse was spotted in the next county over. reply BobaFloutist 14 hours agorootparentprevThe good news is binding arbitration has some significant downsides for corporations - look up \"mass arbitration\". reply lozenge 14 hours agoparentprev> IANAL, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that a court would not allow thatYou and a lot of the people who replied to you seem to be confusing what is unjust with what is illegal.

Presume I already know all the common arguments, evaluated them using my background knowledge (which includes a PhD in biology, extensive experience in human genome analysis, and years of launching products in tech).I&#x27;ve been asking people to come up with coherent arguments for genome secrecy (given the technical knowledge we have of privacy, both in tech and medicine) and nobody has managed to come up with anything that I hadn&#x27;t heard before, typically variations on \"well, gattaca, and maybe something else we can&#x27;t predict, or insurance, or something something\". reply sedatk 11 hours agorootparent1) You can be subject to discrimination based on your ethnicity, race, or health related factors. That&#x27;s especially a problem when the data leaks at scale as in 23andme&#x27;s case because that motivates the development of easy-to-search databases sold in hacking forums. The data you presented here would be harder to find, but not the case with mass leaks.2) It&#x27;s a risk for anything that&#x27;s DNA-based. For example, your data can be used to create false evidence for crimes irrelevant to you. You don&#x27;t even need to be a target for that. You can just be an entry in a list of available DNA profiles. I&#x27;m not sure how much DNA can be manufactured based on full genome data, but with CRISPR and everything I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re too far away either. You can even experience that accidentally because the data is out there and mistakes happen.3) You can&#x27;t be famous. If you&#x27;re famous, you&#x27;d be target of endless torrent of news based on your DNA bits. You&#x27;d be stigmatized left and right.4) You can&#x27;t change your DNA, so when it&#x27;s leaked, you can&#x27;t mitigate the future risks that doesn&#x27;t exist today. For example, DNA-based biometrics, or genome simulation to a point where they can create an accurate lookalike of you. They&#x27;re not risks today, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not tomorrow.There are also additional risks involved based on the country you&#x27;re living in.

It&#x27;s their decision to make, since it&#x27;s their personal data and deemed confidential under most privacy frameworks, and therefore a breach. reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentTo your first point: Yes, I generally extend my argument to more or less everything in the modern world. Put your garbage out on the street: reporters can rifle through it looking for evidence.To your second point: we already know DNA can&#x27;t remain confidential (there is no practical mechanism by which even a wealthy person could avoid a sufficiently motivated adversary who wanted to expose their DNA). That&#x27;s just a fact, we should adjust our understanding based on that fact.Most important: sharing my genomic information with the world is not a breach of any privacy framework I&#x27;m aware of and subject to (US laws). Do you have a specific framework or country in mind? reply hot_gril 14 hours agorootparentprevOne non-theoretical risk is that you or a relative leaves DNA on the scene of a crime you didn&#x27;t commit (or?), and this makes you a suspect.

The morality is flipped. Privacy is recognized as a core, natural right. Others have to prove their onus for wanting your biological data. Trusting others is a moral and character weakness, because you have no guarantees as to how that data will be used. Or more specifically, what new ways to analyze and take advantage of that data will become.I think actuaries will care an awful lot about this data and could use it to negatively influence your risk factor, and thus insurance premiums. reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentI think if your prior includes \"trusting others is a moral and character weakness\" then I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful for us to discuss this topic further.As for actuaries, in the US, the GINA law prevents health insurance companies from using this data.

I might talk some stuff over lunch, but will not email it to the person so they have it on record), and I am quick to distrust people once they fail me. Legal protections do matter, because they discourage misuse of unintended data sharing. reply sunnybeetroot 11 hours agorootparentprevThe law could change, allowing the usage of your data without your consent. reply hot_gril 2 hours agorootparentprevThey could also use it to positively influence my risk factor. reply syndacks 8 hours agorootparentprevWhere is it stated exactly that privacy is a core, natural right? Not in the Constitution, though the 4th suggests it. It’s not part of the natural order, I don’t think (most stuff is out in the open). I’m not saying I think privacy is bad or people deserve to have their info out in the open, I just don’t understand why people feel such a right to it, or where governance — natural or man-made — dictates it. reply necovek 5 hours agorootparentprevGenerally, being pseudo-anonymous is what allows open and free discussion (but lots of vitriol too).While genetic information is not yet understood well enough by masses to be abused in stereotyping and rejecting and — indeed — \"cancelling\", there is a huge potential to do so. This especially holds true for gender, racial, national differentiation, genetic disease potential and health profiling — all accessible through a full genome (even if some of the indicators are not with 100% confidence). Lots of this can also be used to start linking genome data to an actual person (helped with data from other contexts), which is where it starts to become risky according to known risk profiles.Unsurprisingly, someone who is likely a white male (I could have checked using your genome too, but loading up your profile above confirms that) with \"no credible genetic risk factors\" is a lot less concerned about opening up their genome to the public: you are unlikely to get discriminated against. With that said, even you can get potentially ignored for your privilege: even I just engaged in that — somewhat discounting a part of your experience&#x2F;claim because you are a white male. Part of that is also education: your extensive experience in the field allows you to make an educated choice. Many can&#x27;t attain that much knowledge before they decide whether to share their genome or not.This opens up the question similar to that entire face recognition fiasco — how will unprivileged be affected by the privileged being mostly used to train the models on and do research on?So the question is how do we ensure enough anonymity to make everyone happy to contribute to the world knowledge, but reduce chances of linking data back to actual people? I know nebula.org is doing something of the sort (though mostly just guaranteeing that they will remove the data at your request, and not share it without your permission), but we could have one genome produce a bunch of part-genomes, still allowing causation&#x2F;correlation research, but none of them having the full picture.That would disable some of the groundwork research (is there a correlation&#x2F;causation only visible in the full genome or larger part of it?), so it&#x27;s a tricky balance to find.And finally, I always like to make this choice a bit personal: how would you feel about your child being linked to a criminal case due to your genome being publicly available? reply BobaFloutist 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m gonna start making clones of you. reply dekhn 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m fine with that, but merely having my genome sequence doesn&#x27;t enable you to do that. reply necovek 4 hours agorootparentWasn&#x27;t your original argument that they could easily get your genetic material (to figure out the genome from) anyway?Would a bunch of your cells be sufficient at some point in the near future? (I know progress is being made to turn any cell into a reproductive cell, but that&#x27;s still not exactly the same thing, but it&#x27;s on that exact path)You still might not mind a bunch of your clones though, so I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s much of an argument. reply downWidOutaFite 14 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not the same risk because 23andme also has name, address, email.One risk if you have PII+genome is that a technically sophisticated entity can determine if you&#x27;ve physically been in a location. Also with an extensive PII+genome database they could find your family, for example for blackmail purposes.Another risk is that a health insurance provider could deny you based on potential health issues they find in your genome. reply hiatus 13 hours agorootparentTechnically, even without PII an adversary could determine that you have been in a physical place, they just wouldn&#x27;t know what to call you. reply dekhn 13 hours agorootparentprevYes, but technically sophisticated entities can also use methods that require less effort.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;538&#x2F; reply zlg_codes 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s your defense?

Clearly just a spoiler. reply dekhn 11 hours agorootparentWhat real, actual risks which I didn&#x27;t already know about have been shown in this thread?The point is that while you can use DNA to identify people in most cases, sufficiently motivated adversaries have more effective, cheaper, lower-technology approaches that they will use first. reply necovek 4 hours agorootparentLike with many things, the issue is the aggregation of data on many individuals (a database), and easy accessibility of your individual data on request (discoverability and processing).Me shouting my sensitive private details in a crowded bar is entirely different from putting them on my webpage.

So, with a picture of your retina, a sophisticated adversary could potentially reproduce your retina to allow access to some secure facility.Genomic data doesn&#x27;t have the same risk factors--at least at the moment. I think that the point many are trying to make here is that there may be risk vectors available at some point in the future that aren&#x27;t known now. A couple of theoretical examples:* You had to give a blood sample rather than other biometric data like a retina scan.* Spoofing DNA evidence.

At least 23andMe provided actual value, to some at least.What I find strange is that 23andMe did not automatically delete data after 30 days, or at the very least took it offline, only to be available on request. Notify people that their results are available and inform them that the data will be available for 30 days after the first download.

Do we even know how accurate it is at doing that? reply dekhn 14 hours agorootparentIf you go back in time, 23andMe was founded to collect genetic data with the goal of using that data to improve the health condition of humanity.Over time it became clear that 23andMe&#x27;s data set had limited predictive ability for health for a number of technical reasons (previously, dahinds, one of their statistical geneticists, has defended the quality of their predictions on HN, you can search for his comments. I suspect he can no longer comment on HN because of 23&Me&#x27;s security debacle).However, around that same time, 23&Me&#x27;s dataset turned out to be excellent for ancestry analysis. It&#x27;s generally considered fairly accurate (not just 23&Me- the entire process of ancestry through snp genotyping workings really well).I never did 23&Me but my dad did- and he learned he has children all around the US (half brothers and sisters of mine) from some samples he provided some 45+ years ago. Both my dad and those people gained value from making that connection. It&#x27;s interesting because my dad had already done most of the paper research (including going to SLC to visit the Mormon archives) to identify our obvious ancestors, and these relatives would never have shown up. reply jstarfish 15 hours agorootparentprevAncestry data, but also health markers.

When I signed up for 23andme, I assumed with certainty that it would be hacked and all data leaked at some point. I balanced that with the value of knowing potentially important health&#x2F;genetic bio markers.In the end, I valued knowing these bio markers above the privacy of my genome. The former is actionable and I can use it to optimize my health and longevity; the latter is of vague value and not terribly exploitable outside of edge-case threat models. reply smarkov 17 hours agorootparentExactly my thoughts.I&#x27;d be more upset if a combination of my name and email&#x2F;phone number got leaked than if my DNA was made available public. reply tuwtuwtuwtuw 17 hours agorootparentWhy would you be upset if your name+phone combo was leaked?

Some minor ones, but nothing I didn&#x27;t know already. I loved learning about my ancient ancestry, though (ie migratory patterns 300k years ago.)On balance, was the utility worth the cost (of a breach)? Probably not, because I found no major actionable issues. But if I did find severe biomarkers, it would have been worth it. So I do still think I made the right choice. reply logifail 13 hours agorootparentprev> I can use it to optimize my health and longevityQ: Is it a HN thing to be (obsessively?) interested in health and longevity?Dying is a natural process.

During the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), two goats were chosen: one to be sacrificed and the other to be sent into the wilderness, symbolically carrying away the sins of the community. This second goat was called the \"Azazel\" or the \"scapegoat\".Over time, the term \"scapegoat\" evolved to have a more general meaning in English. It came to refer to a person or group that is unjustly blamed for the problems or misfortunes of others, reflecting the original ritual in which the goat was symbolically burdened with the sins of others before being sent away. \" reply VBprogrammer 16 hours agorootparentprevIn the US, the bad actor here is much more likely to be insurance companies who can tune their secret algorithms to make sure no one with a gene tied to an illness which blooms later in life can get affordable heath care. reply tfehring 16 hours agorootparentIn the US, health insurers can only price based on age, location, and tobacco use. Setting health insurance premiums or denying coverage based on any health-related factors has been illegal for over a decade, and changing that would be totally unviable politically.However, it&#x27;s a significant risk for other types of insurance including life, disability, and long term care. reply imiric 15 hours agorootparentJust because it&#x27;s illegal, doesn&#x27;t mean health insurance companies don&#x27;t find loopholes, and consider fines when they get caught as the cost of doing business. See this series of articles[1] for some of their criminal shenanigans.It&#x27;s more than likely that they would use genetic data to deny insurance, and then settle the cases in court if they happen to get sued, which statistically is probably a rare occurrence.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.propublica.org&#x2F;series&#x2F;uncovered reply maxerickson 10 hours agorootparentThey are denying claims.

Both of which exist, and are free.So far, the only real use-case for doing this is people trying to identify criminals from just DNA. reply slingnow 15 hours agorootparentYou realize this data is often available for purchase or eventually publicly leaked, right?

At least in the US, there are already protections for genetic information (including but not limited to GINA [1]).In the long run, I think keeping your genetic information private will be untenable- the potential benefits will outweigh the drawbacks. Plus, anyone sufficiently motivated could get your DNA somehow, you shed your DNA everywhere you go, no getting around that.So what&#x27;s left is to urge your representatives to maintain and strengthen regulations on how that information can be used, and in the long run we&#x27;ll just have to trust that that will be enough.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Genetic_Information_Nondiscrim... reply pavel_lishin 17 hours agorootparent> In the long run, I think keeping your genetic information private will be untenable- the potential benefits will outweigh the drawbacks.Can you give an example?> Plus, anyone sufficiently motivated could get your DNA somehow, you shed your DNA everywhere you go, no getting around that.That assumes there&#x27;s someone out to get you specifically.

I&#x27;d imagine that even with current technology, a sufficiently motivated organization could sample various locations to reconstruct the genomes of people who often visit there. With enough info, they could start building webs of genetic relation. From there, all they&#x27;d need is access to a database of samples from known individuals (which, as we can see, already exists), can chances are they could quickly deanonymize future samples. The only thing that could stop such mass collection is proper regulation.> That&#x27;s like saying there&#x27;s no point in having 2FA or strong passwords, because the FSB, the FBI and Mossad can get in anyway.Unlike your password, your DNA is unencrypted and gets spread everywhere. reply slingnow 15 hours agorootparent>> That&#x27;s like saying there&#x27;s no point in having 2FA or strong passwords, because the FSB, the FBI and Mossad can get in anyway.> Unlike your password, your DNA is unencrypted and gets spread everywhere.This doesn&#x27;t address the point. In both cases, someone sufficiently motivated could get what they want from you. So by your argument, there&#x27;s no point in maintaining privacy for either piece of information (DNA &#x2F; passwords). reply 6177c40f 12 hours agorootparent> So by your argument, there&#x27;s no point in maintaining privacy for either piece of information (DNA &#x2F; passwords).The problem with privacy is that it&#x27;s fragile. When your info is leaked, you should assume it&#x27;s out there for good.I also think that while right now when you do the cost&#x2F;benefit analysis of having your DNA sequenced, you think the cost outweights the benefit. Clearly my personal calculus is different than yours, and that&#x27;s ok. But I would caution you that in the future that calculation may be different for you.So I think people will either lose privacy, or voluntarily give up some privacy for some benefit. In either case, we will need something other than privacy to protect ourselves.

I believe that in the future, however, the promise of precision medicine will be realized, and that having one&#x27;s genetic information readily available will be crucial to receiving the best treatment possible for many diseases.For example, take Crohn&#x27;s Disease (and other inflammatory diseases more generally). The current thinking is that it is highly influenced by genetics, and that a number of different genotypes exist that can result in the phenotype we refer to as Crohn&#x27;s Disease. It&#x27;s conceivable that having a better understanding of someone&#x27;s specific genotype could lead to more precise treatment of their condition.> And why do you assume that it won&#x27;t be accompanied by negatives?I explicitly don&#x27;t assume this, I said that the benefits will outweigh the drawbacks.> the sole agent of evil in this world is people.This is a specious argument. By that same measure, the sole agent of good in the world is also people. But that&#x27;s irrelevant. Tech can be used both to harm and to benefit, and I&#x27;m arguing that personal gene sequencing can and will be used to provide more benefit than harm. reply quantified 8 hours agorootparentYes, you did reference both, and I lost track in my response.I expect a few relatively wealthy people to get some benefit, for example when they have real health conditions that can be helped by genetic knowledge. I don&#x27;t expect benefit for the rest. Across the population, some will have net benefit, some will have net drawback, and it would be very easy for the second group to be an order of magnitude larger than the first. reply mauvehaus 18 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone opted in as such.

Unless regulated, this will be data that gets collected and abused en-masse.

It is almost an ad every single minute. Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet. Become a Redditor and join one of thousands of communities. × 571 572 573 YouTube doesn't want to take down scam adsDrama (self.youtube) submitted 22 hours ago by Jakob_G Hey Reddit, i recently noticed that there are way more scam ads on YouTube. And i am not talking about those ads of people selling you get rich quick courses, which i get to see way too often as well, i am talking about deep fake Elon Musk saying that he has built an AI powered trading bot that will allow you to make 1 million dollars in 6 months risk free and to be honest i can't tell that it is deep fake, it looks very real. Here is the link to the ad: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWGb0BLYBOs https://preview.redd.it/z7zagtomju5c1.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ed808fbf9800784a6bb1698fac2317d8e5f2a85 or here another one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE77YkmsbDc&t=75s I am from Austria so i get to see the German version of these scams as well. Like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Iyuyx5thgI or this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMRY5dxnZ4E The first one i have seen so many times it gets ridiculous. Its about a famous German figure supposedly being sued by the central bank because he found an infinite money glitch. And because these scam ads are getting so annoying i started reporting them every time i see one, because i do understand that there are probably millions of advertisers on YouTube and sometimes these scams don't get detected right away. So i also reported that Fake Elon Musk Ad, but the next day i get shown the exact same ad again, then i open my email inbox finding a YouTube email about my report stating \"We decided not to take this ad down. We found that the ad doesn’t go against Google’s policies\". The same goes for all four ads listed above, all reported, all apparently not against policy. So one of these two is true: 1 - Elon Musk has actually found a way to make everyone rich with ai. 2 - YouTube simply doesn't care about people getting scammed as long as they make money. As much as i would like the first one to be true, these YouTube Ads are not cheap to run, with one of them running for more than a month with 364K views. So the fact that the scammers are able to afford these ads means that people keep falling for these scams, and YouTube doesn't seem to care at all. And i don't want to use an adblocker because i want the people i watch to get paid for their work, but i don't want them to be paid with the money from the victims of these scams. Is this a regional problem in Austria or do you see these scams too? 140 comments share save hide report all 140 comments sorted by: best (suggested) topnewcontroversialoldrandomq&alive (beta) Want to add to the discussion?

Seems like pretty simple liability on their part. Youtube is platforming these scams and is also platforming the Elon deepfake. If he gave a fuck I'm pretty sure it would be relatively simple with his amount of money and legal team to sue youtube for hosting this video and they would have to take it down, he could potentially even sue them for a form of defamation for hosting such a video. I'm not a lawyer though. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]_N3ph 15 points16 points17 points 18 hours ago (2 children) I had the same experience, I kept seeing these Elon Musk Deepfaked videos of him giving some key note speeches for some crypto platform. They all pointed to different URLs as well, probably the same company behind the ads OP posted about. I reported them all. I kept getting emails back that they didn't see anything wrong with the advertisement. I appealed a few times since it was an obvious deep fake. Same response, \"If you don't like them you can block the advertiser\" Now I don't get emails back when I report an ad so ironically I think I have been blocked from reporting ads permalink embed save report reply [–]cowmowtv 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago (0 children) Search for a scam where you could do a chargeback (e.g. dropshipping scam), \"fall for it\", report the ad, hope YouTube doesn‘t do anything and file a online police report against the scammers and also YouTube for supporting those scammers if your state allows to do so. At least in accordance to German law, if you could prove to YouTube an advertiser has set up a scam ad and YouTube won‘t take action after a report, the person who was responsible for handling the report could get criminal charges, too. YouTube makes money with advertisements, therefore they also have responsibilities. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Standard-Rule63 1 point2 points3 points 13 hours ago (0 children) Thing is blocking does nothing.

The human reviews google does are not what you think they are. You imagine someone at Google receiving an email, opening the ad, watching it, researching for 2 minutes and answering. What actually happens is someone gets paid a pittance to have 20 tabs open and click \"reject\" in as many as they can in the least amount of time to meet their quotas and feed their family since Google also likes to do these in developing countries (geo is not the problem, salary is) rather than pay proper salaries. Until they are forced to charge enough money for their services to actually provide human support where it's needed, nothing will change. They'll keep banning adwords accounts, letting fraudulent ads out, and a number of other things that need review. permalink embed save report reply [–]jonathan_levitz_1999 29 points30 points31 points 17 hours ago* (13 children) YouTube will do anything for money, even if it's illegal.

EU has no more sovereignty than the US has and it's controlled by the same financial elites than the US. I'm a EU citizen. Let me be clear here: there's no true democracy anywhere in the world.

Google is just a search engine.

Lots of flash games that gave you viruses and awful hoax stuff like the human dog hybrid thing. It wasn't until 2010-2012 when the ads started becoming actually bearable. Car ads, movie trailers (that varied in quality but were still trailers nonetheless), music, etc. It wasn't perfect. There were a few hiccups, like the fact that you got a lot of pro religious ads on antitheist channels. But it was a system that worked. Now, it feels like Google is taking us back to the era of shitty ads, except worse. Edit: I would also like to point out that the spam bots have gone absolutely wild. Last night, I saw a whole ass thread of bots speaking to each other about a passive income scam...on a video about the lady who has to flee Texas to get an abortion on a nonviable pregnancy.

It's not difficult to create accounts and post ads, and it's nearly impossible to monitor and control everything that closely. One thing that could potentially be useful in mitigating this may be raising the pricing of ads, but that would also eliminate a ton of small businesses from being able to advertise on YT/Google so... idk. permalink embed save report reply [–]dazchad 10 points11 points12 points 19 hours ago (7 children) Of course they can. Don’t let their narrative convince you otherwise. They earn money to display those ads, so they can pay somebody to curate what is shown. They don’t because they can get away with it until some major PR hits them on the face. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]TheEdward39 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (6 children) I'm sure that also plays a role but... You can set as low a daily limit as something like a single dollar. That's why I'm saying it's overly cheap. I'm almost 100% certain that paying someone to manually check ads wouldn't be worth it for ads with a daily budget that is less than the daily wage of a full-time employee in proportion to the display rate of a specific campaign. They can use an automated system to check it for obvious TOS-breaks, like pornography (although we've seen that a low opacity overlay can slip through unnoticed) or gore; but an algorithm will likely not be able to spot a scam. But yeah, I generally agree that ads should cost at least marginally more money, and should be controlled much more strictly. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Straight-Clothes484 7 points8 points9 points 18 hours ago (0 children) The viability of Google's business is not our problem The company that just did a massive PR day about how they have the best AI can't future out how to automate those? permalink embed save parent report reply [–]DM_Sledge 3 points4 points5 points 16 hours ago (2 children) What you are saying is that they choose not to monitor these ads because \"it would cost money\".

These choices have consequences. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]TheEdward39 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (1 child) I am almost 100% sure that is the main reason behind it.

Its like the little stores that installed self checkouts, when they still need someone to stand near them, and only ever scheduled one person to run the self checkout in the first place. Someone high up decided this would save them money. Now people are being told to \"increase SCO numbers\" or be fired etc. The solution to this is that the cashier has to run over to the self checkout when people want to pay, and check them out using the SCO. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Close 2 points3 points4 points 18 hours ago* (0 children) It doesn't take a day to check these ads - Say for a 30 second ad we could take 1 minute for someone to watch the video and click a green tick (good) or a red tick (bad). For any red tick (bad) videos we could then send it to a more senior person to review, annotate with the reason code (i.e. the policy it violated), and then block the originating source. If you pay someone $6 an hour to review offshore, that's 10 cents per ad. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]DontQuoteMeOnTheNews 1 point2 points3 points 15 hours ago (0 children) You can set as low a daily limit as something like a single dollar. Right, except that Google chose those limits. If the minimum spend is actually too low to be worth paying someone to validate that ads aren't literally elon musk deepfakes, they always have the option of raising it. There's a difference between something being impossible, and something being less profitable. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]kdklv_ 2 points3 points4 points 20 hours ago (3 children) t to create accounts and post ads, and it's nearly impossible to monitor and control everything that closely. Well, they are quite adept at downright harassing small creators over minor issues, such as background music. I believe they are more than capable of manually checking the ads that are going to make them money in the same way they check if the content meets their standards. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]TheEdward39 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (2 children) Afaik the contentID system is automatic, that’s why it’s so difficult to actually get a video unmuted if you do end up owning the rights to the music, because your appeal will likely not reach an actual human being for a long ass time. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]Goldenier 1 point2 points3 points 19 hours ago (1 child) They could \"easily\" do same thing, contentID for detecting celebrity faces an brand logos and making it require extra verification if some ads are using them. It's very likely they will end up doing something like that in the future, they just need few big companies threatening or suing them before they start to act. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]TheEdward39 0 points1 point2 points 19 hours ago (0 children) They could, yeah. It might actually be pretty useful too, since the bulk of these scams are now using deepfake celebrities and AI voices.

Like why have a report button if you ignore my reports anyway. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]TheEdward39 1 point2 points3 points 20 hours ago (0 children) Fair enough. Their report system has always been pretty shit too, not unlike with Meta, when you report anything at all, chances are it won't ever reach a real human being. Other than that, even if they do remove it (like the Mr. Beast scam videos) they often just come back the next day on a brand new channel. I think it's inevitable that every social media platform will, in time, be full of shitty scam or scam-adjacent ads unfortunately. permalink embed save parent report reply [–]digitaltransmutation 1 point2 points3 points 17 hours ago (0 children) funny, my experience with Adsense is that if you do a minor oopsie they will block you as a person and also ban any future accounts that you make if they can possibly correlate your identity. They will not issue warnings or tell you what specifically you did wrong and there is nobody to talk to.

I've reported them every time but I feel like I'm just shouting into the void. Google has the tech to stop this at the source, they don't bother, because they don't care. Revenue is more important than preventing the stupid and naïve from spending their life savings on a scam. I think I'm going to try and report this to the my local CBC news outlets and see if I can get any traction. What's interesting tho is every time I check the advertisers info in the ad when I'm reporting it, it always comes up as : About this advertiser Advertiser has not yet verified their identity Advertiser Click Tech Limited (this varies) Location Hong Kong (this varies) So I'm curious... why is Google allowing non verified advertisers to show ads? Shouldn't this form of blind faith advertising either be illegal or open Google up to liability for not doing due diligence about who they allow to advertise? You'd never see these ads get the light of day on TV broadcasts... so what's the loophole here? permalink embed save report reply [–]neytey 0 points1 point2 points 16 hours ago (0 children) Youtube is all about money these days, I am from austria myself and I saw this ad multiple times.

A whole back I reported an obvious real estate scam using Wayne Gretzky and some Blue Jays player (I&#x27;m in Canada). The reply was it didn&#x27;t break any policy.When ads are the primary source of revenue, there&#x27;s zero incentive to police the platform reply ForkMeOnTinder 19 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s even worse: the incentive is to police the creators, not the advertisers. Youtube will bend over backwards for advertisers whose \"brand safety\" team doesn&#x27;t want their product to appear next to a swear word, and demonetize&#x2F;strike&#x2F;etc those creators. But the ad content itself isn&#x27;t policed nearly as relentlessly. reply TazeTSchnitzel 19 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;d think that creators making people want to use the site would be important, but unfortunately YouTube is a monopoly and is addictive, so content is more or less fungible from Google&#x27;s perspective. If you aren&#x27;t viewing ads on creator A&#x27;s content, you&#x27;ll probably be viewing them on creator B&#x27;s content instead. It&#x27;s not like other streaming services where there is real competition and losing particular content would make people go to competitors. reply dspillett 18 hours agorootparent> You&#x27;d think that creators making people want to use the site would be importantYouTube&#x27;s audience size and advertising metrics have long since gone through the point where individual creators or groups of them matter little. If a creator walks off the platform there are more who will fill the place, in search of potential monetisation, so youtube will still have somewhere to hang adverts off. An advertiser leaving is harder to replace than a content provider.eBay has a similar flip some years ago: they realised that there was more value caring for buyers needs than sellers: sellers swarm in attracted by the number of buyers and are difficult to put off for long as there are often few other options, buyers need to feel safe to hand around. reply bcrosby95 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s quite obvious they either have advertiser problems or their ad serving algorithm sucks.I get so many repeats in stuff I&#x27;m not interested in at all, and completely unrelated to what I watch.I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a matter of those ads bidding the highest or what. But YouTube&#x27;s ability to show something I&#x27;m interested in is worse than even what the daytime TV ads were back in the day. reply ben_w 15 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t buy ads on any of the major platforms.Twitter (when I downloaded my info, they were still called that) classified me as speaking three languages I know zero words of, and as having interests in several sports (I care for none); my YouTube ad experience is like yours; my Facebook experience today was about renouncing my US citizenship (I&#x27;m a British national); the Instagram ads are only marginally less bad — I do find myself liking them, but I have no idea what they&#x27;re selling because what I get shown are all uplifting landscapes or cute animals with no sales pitch.Edit: also, a friend of mine was just playing a game, advert popped up in a language neither of us could read. I had to open Google Translate just to find out it was Romanian and which button was \"close\" (and also to discover that it was an ad for \"easy and fast international payments\"?) reply mikrotikker 17 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s kinda good it means whatever privacy steps you&#x27;re taking are working reply bambax 16 hours agorootparentprev> YouTube is a monopoly and is addictiveYoutube is indeed a monopoly -- but it&#x27;s not actually addictive. Since they started this war against adblockers I have found that I can perfectly live without it.When I absolutely would like to watch an informative video (for example, about how to fix something on my bike, etc.), I first try to open the video in a private window (with ublock on); if that also doesn&#x27;t work I try to use yt-dlp.But I have completely stopped mindlessly watching videos that are not the result of a search.There&#x27;s nothing necessary about youtube. reply KMnO4 16 hours agorootparent> but it&#x27;s not actually addictiveYoutube is definitely addictive to a large population of people.

It’s not addictive in the sense that your brain craves it’s chemicals but it definitely is habit-forming, watching video after video after video on electric motors and their construction has sent me down rabbit holes. Software topics, talks, how to’s, engineering channels, gaming drivel, it’s definitely a habit. reply johnnyanmac 9 hours agorootparentprevCongrats (kind of), but we can&#x27;t view \"addiciton\" in a microcosm of 1. And regardless, addiction isn&#x27;t the term I&#x27;d use to describe the problem. maybe more like all-encompassing.But the real problem is that Youtube makes all this money but it still took a decade+ to start looking profitable. It&#x27;s extremely hard to compete with them even if you somehow got over the network effects because it&#x27;s hard to make money while also paying content creators. Google could do it because they could commoditize youtube&#x27;s early unprofitability to their ads revenue.Ideally, something like Netflix spawns and lets \"amateur\" content creators host as well, which solves many problems. But netflix doesn&#x27;t seem interested and the few competitors doing that are still in the discovery phase. reply rurp 12 hours agorootparentprevBeing addictive doesn&#x27;t mean that that literally everyone who uses it will become addicted. Most people who use alcohol, or pain killers, or gamble can stop without much trouble; that doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t a subset of users who get dangerously addicted.It&#x27;s great that you&#x27;re in the majority of people who aren&#x27;t addicted to Youtube, but that doesn&#x27;t mean everyone has the same experience that you do. reply bambax 12 hours agorootparent> Being addictive doesn&#x27;t mean that that literally everyone who uses it will become addictedNot everyone, sure, but a majority. People can get addicted to anything; yet we don&#x27;t just call any activity addictive -- only those where most people have a hard time controlling their behavior.I don&#x27;t think watching youtube qualifies (not just being on your phone, or watching tv). reply swid 5 hours agorootparentYouTube is probably more addictive than gambling, and it’s pretty clear and accepted some minority of people get addicted to that. reply vkou 16 hours agorootparentprev> You&#x27;d think that creators making people want to use the site would be important,The economics of supply and demand disagree with you.A lot more people want to be creators, than there is money in the ecosystem to support them.If you want to hold platforms responsible for scams being advertised on them, you&#x27;re going to need to rewrite a lot of law. reply rollcat 16 hours agorootparentprevTrue, and it&#x27;s so ironic when the situation reverses...Of the ads that recently slipped through my adblockers, one was a xenophobic piece of Hungarian propaganda against illegal immigrants. It was shown in the middle of a Minecraft video (a game without binary gender); that was made by a disabled person; to people living in a city where ~50% of the population was born elsewhere. Google does have all of that context, and yet this is what their ad selection algorithm picks.This is one among many reasons why I have absolutely zero moral reservations about blocking YouTube ads. (inb4 ad money: I do support creators directly, as my budget allows.) reply kmeisthax 15 hours agorootparentGoogle doesn&#x27;t care about the context, they care about who pays the most for the ad. Hungarian fascists have deep pockets[0] and are willing to spend shittons of money to make you watch lies about immigrants[1]. Most of that money is wasted, but if they can radicalize even one out of a million viewers, they won. So they pay loads for it.Yes, this is the same math that scammers run on - because fascism is a scam category, alongside advanced-fee fraud, refund scammers, and fake tech support companies. Your grandpa thinks the immigrants are invading the country for the same reason he thinks he needs to wire $10,000 to the &#x27;bank&#x27; of a Nigerian &#x27;prince&#x27;.also> It was shown in the middle of a Minecraft video (a game without binary gender)For the same reasons as above, the creator of Minecraft went from \"I don&#x27;t want gender in my game\" to \"all women are evil\", because he isolated himself in an LA mansion and read nothing but Twitter. He also had a girlfriend he broke up with. This makes you vulnerable to being fed bullshit that agrees with you - in the same way that expecting a UPS package might make you vulnerable to clicking a fake UPS text that steals your login info. Either that, or Notch was a trans inclusive radical misogynist[2] the whole time!Now, let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a scammer. Your 1-in-a-million odds suck - but what if you could pay more money to find more vulnerable people to send texts to? Like, even if you went from paying $1 CPM[3] for 1-in-a-million odds to $10 CPM for 1-in-ten-thousand, which is mathematically identical, you still get an advantage because less people can see what you&#x27;re trying to steal. Targeted advertising lets you do this[4], and for unrelated reasons, legitimate advertisers will pay more to target their ads to a smaller but more lucrative cohort as well. So Google inherently makes more money the more they build out tools for scammers to do their scamming.You are perfectly in the right to block ads. I pay for YouTube Premium but I won&#x27;t yell at anyone who uses uBlock Origin.[0] To be clear, we don&#x27;t know exactly where the money comes from, though I can guess either Russia or Saudi Arabia[1] The core irony of fascism is that the most efficient way to demonize the other is to point out that the other also has a fascist wing. e.g. in America, Christofascists yell and scream that we need a Muslim ban to keep Islamofascist terrorists out.[2] See also: James Somerton[3] Cost per French thousand[4] If you read between the lines I&#x27;m accusing Google for the last decade of democratic backsliding. reply johnnyanmac 3 hours agorootparent>because fascism is a scam category, alongside advanced-fee fraud, refund scammers, and fake tech support companies.Facism or not, those heavy ad campaigns come from the most extreme ends of the spectrum. And the new age will adapt to new tech faster. It&#x27;s no suprise this is the result of it all, especially when platforms can claim article 243 to prevent any litigation against them.>For the same reasons as above, the creator of Minecraft went from \"I don&#x27;t want gender in my game\" to \"all women are evil\", because he isolated himself in an LA mansion and read nothing but Twitter.ehh, who knows. 10 years is a long time and the first statement was made some 8 years prior to the 2nd. Could be bad experiences IRL or on the net, or both. Could be wounds much much older than Minecraft coming up.>You are perfectly in the right to block ads. I pay for YouTube Premium but I won&#x27;t yell at anyone who uses uBlock Origin.Google has plenty of money and adtech as a concept is the antithesis to how I operate (let&#x27;s COMPLETELY TANK the performance of your web browsing because people will pay us to be hostile t the user. And then tank it more so we have proof that the user actually got successfully harassed).But from a purely logical perspective, I don&#x27;t like the argument of \"google has bad ads, therefore I block all ads\". That just doesn&#x27;t track well. reply kazinator 15 hours agorootparentprevYoutube puts ads for investment funds in the middle of videos for three-year-olds. reply mrweasel 17 hours agorootparentprevI do wonder, clearly there is a perverse incentive for YouTube to be less strict with ads, but is it also a question of availability? I&#x27;ve been paying for YouTube Premium, so haven&#x27;t seen ads in a while, but before that I noticed that there was almost no variety in the ads. You just got the same three or four ads on repeat.What I&#x27;m wondering is: Does YouTube not have enough quality advertisers? You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d turn away the scammers, because actual business doesn&#x27;t want to be on the same platform as some shady \"buy&#x2F;sell gold\" or similar. If they don&#x27;t, is that because there&#x27;s no money, or not enough honest business buying ads in a sufficient amount? Or is it that YouTube just makes more on the scams? reply phatskat 15 hours agorootparentprevA channel I follow does ad reads in the middle of the show, and as such had to say “Say-bay-Day” when advertising a CBD product because YT would demonetize the video if they just pronounced it as one would pronounce “See-Bee-Dee”.It’s wild that they couldn’t advertise a sponsor but YT allows scam ads to roll before their videos reply fallingknife 18 hours agorootparentprevIn the Youtube economic model the advertisers are the customer and the creators are the vendors (the viewer is the product), so that actually makes sense and isn&#x27;t really any different from any other business.

The same being true with respect to Taoiseach. I would like to point out that they are not the same positions.

A third party created a bogus profile of a global brand and began releasing unfavorable content as though they were the brand. The global brand leveraged their relationship with Google to shutdown the profile (which could be labeled as satirical).

I stopped bothering to report obvious scams on Facebook as any response I got was they didn&#x27;t breach any standards (for others I got no response at all), yet I&#x27;ve had a comment removed because calling someone a numbskull was unduly rude&#x2F;aggressive&#x2F;whatever (I forget the exact complaint given).For a while I added comments details why it was so obvious the scam posts were scams, but this has little effect as my comment would be quickly drowned out by the many “I got mine OK!” and “thanks!” comments that are presumably placed by compromised accounts. It also backfires: commenting, even to point out the scammyness, is interaction – that interaction tells the recommendation algorithms that I might want to see more of that sort of thing or worse that my friends&#x2F;family would also. reply mavamaarten 17 hours agorootparentFor Facebook though, I understand why they want the scammers to continue using their platform.

And why would advertisers pay for ads if consumers are not engaging with them?Thus, Google has an incentive to keep the ad space free of scams - it makes Google users more valuable to advertisers. reply onion2k 12 hours agorootparentMaybe the fact Google doesn&#x27;t police Ads is a signal that advertising isn&#x27;t as lucrative as it once was... reply TremendousJudge 19 hours agorootparentprevGPs argument is the opposite of this: it&#x27;s not about the scammers, but about the legit brands. The same way Pepsi doesn&#x27;t want to get their ads shown over somebody discussing STDs or something of the sort, they probably also don&#x27;t want to get their ads shown next to scams, since it makes the product kinda seem like a scam by association. reply IggleSniggle 16 hours agorootparentIt also increases the cost of the ad, though, by introducing more buyer competition for the available slot. And a higher cost per available slot is good for the seller AND for the middlemen involved in the transaction. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentDoes it increase the cost of the ad? Or does it decrease the cost of ads because the larger number of legitimate products don&#x27;t want to be there and so are not buying ads at all. reply IggleSniggle 11 hours agorootparentIt increases the cost in the short term, and potentially decreases the cost in the longer term. replystaunton 17 hours agorootparentprevMost people believe they themselves cannot be influenced by ads \"at all\".

When something else is the goal it is much harder to measure.Most ads are about a future purchase. They need to measure not did you buy now from this ad, but did all the ads you saw across all platforms (YouTube, Facebook, radio, tv, billboards) make enough of a difference in your buying habits when you finally buy. This is hard to measure, but it is more important. Most people are not buying now from an ad, they are buying in the future.Sometimes ads are about an image. Even if you cannot afford some luxury good, they may want to advertise so that you recognize it on someone else and think \"that is a rich person\". reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentprevwhich is why I said I take steps to avoid the influence, but not that I&#x27;m not influenced. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 14 hours agoparentprevThere was a time before people called websites \"platforms\".

The operators of these mega websites, posing as so-called \"tech\" companies, argue they are providing a valuable \"service\" to web users, valued at a price of zero dollars. Truly they are only interested in providing a service to advertisers. If advertisers stop paying, the operators will be forced to scale back the surveillance as it&#x27;s too expensive to host peoples&#x27; files for free.

Investors want to see profitability.But it&#x27;s also a problem unique to trillion dollar companies: finding growth. If you have a money printer of $280B per year, how do you find growth that moves the needle?For new product development, you&#x27;d need to launch a product that brings in revenue of say $20B, otherwise it&#x27;s just not that interesting.Imagine how hard it is to launch a new product like that? If you&#x27;d have a billion users (which is absurdly hard for a new product), you&#x27;d then need to monetize them for $20 per year per user. In a saturated competitive environment where users don&#x27;t want to pay.Hence, the more common strategy is to turn some dials on the existing money printer. Just increase ads.That&#x27;s why FB&#x27;s Metaverse bet wasn&#x27;t crazy at all. You make $100B+, social media is stagnating, and you need a huge new revenue stream. They don&#x27;t really exist. You have to go crazy on big bets. reply marcosdumay 18 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s a high interest rate phenomenonWell, it&#x27;s more of an interest rate change phenomenon.All companies are currently overvalued by absurd amounts, but the computer-related ones have it dialed a few dozen notches above \"absurd\".

For some, increasing profits isn&#x27;t the growth that matters. Rather, increasing the rate at which profits are increasing is the true metric. So even vastly increased profits can still be a form of failure that requires more actions be taken to wring more money out of the platform and its users. reply ploum 19 hours agorootparentprevWell, that’s the definition of a private company, isn’t it?It would be naive to think a company could behave otherwise in the long term. reply givemeethekeys 13 hours agoparentprevThey definitely police the platform.

They bring in a lot of money now so YouTube is not interesting in policing them, but they are a risk that they will suddenly go away for legal reasons. which is why I don&#x27;t understand why YouTube doesn&#x27;t police them now - between the potential loss in court and the big companies staying away there is a lot of risk to YouTube.Note too that if YouTube would police scam ads better they would have a better message to various countries that laws and legal action is not needed at all. Right now I&#x27;m shocked the EU hasn&#x27;t put in place harsh laws about ads - if YouTube would police their own ads they could have a slightly less harsh policy in place and thus make it not worth while for the EU to pass the harsh law they don&#x27;t like. reply GuB-42 14 hours agoparentprevBut then, it there is no incentive to police the platform, there should be sexual content in ads, and yet, I don&#x27;t even remember seeing ads for vibrators or other \"soft\" adult stuff.

There are scams, but not many obvious counterfeits.To be fair, I block ads, so I don&#x27;t see many, but the few times I don&#x27;t have them blocked, they are usually the kind you see on TV: big brand products, blockbuster video games, etc... with the very occasional scam and maybe a few of these fake games.

Probably because it may hurt their viewership, or drive off other advertisers.And they don&#x27;t seem to do it to comply with some laws, or making it more kid friendly since, as you said, sports betting gets a pass, even if it is absolutely \"adult\" and maybe even illegal in some countries. Obviously, scams are illegal too.It just mean they think scams don&#x27;t give them enough of a bad reputation to police against, which is weird do me, one would think that reputable brands wouldn&#x27;t want to appear next to scammers. reply FirmwareBurner 19 hours agoparentprev> (I&#x27;m in Canada) The reply was it didn&#x27;t break any policy. When ads are the primary source of revenue, there&#x27;s zero incentive to police the platformTL;DR:If you&#x27;re a major on-line ad distributor like Google&#x2F;Meta, and broadcast malicious ads to consumers, then you should be liable for them according to local laws just how TV and radio broadcasters are liable for the same thing.Long argument:Sure those ads don&#x27;t break Youtube&#x2F;Google&#x27;s own internal policy (why would they, they&#x27;re an ad company reporting to their shareholders), but what about breaking the nation&#x27;s&#x2F;Canada&#x27;s policy on ads? I bet there might be some fines there to be handed out. Hear me out.If such scams aren&#x27;t legally allowed on licensed national TV and radio channels or printed media, otherwise the broadcasters and publishers would face crippling fines, then why do we as government agencies allow Youtube to get away with broadcasting these scams to its viewers?Sure, Youtube is not a licensed TV broadcaster but maybe we should start regulating them partly as such, similarly how the EU&#x27;s Digital Markets Act aims to fix current major digital gatekeepers and make them as compliant as physical markets.I mean, one of the main reasons big-tech has reaped such insane profits is that the same regulations that apply to traditional physical businesses like brick and mortar markets and media broadcasters, did not apply to them because they operated on the unregulated Wild West that was the internet, while also extracting all the global profits that come from operating on such a global scale except with none of the costs assigned to local legal regulatory compliance that operating physical business have.So now it&#x27;s time to patch these digital loopholes and have big-tech operating in the ad space just as accountable as the rest of the businesses, considering their size, outreach and therefore influence on the gen-pop. Google&#x27;s not a scrappy start-up anymore, they can definitely afford to police the ads they serve according to the local laws, considering their size, workforce, ML tech and profits. Same with Meta and their ad network. reply vannevar 19 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re a major on-line ad distributor like Google&#x2F;Meta, and broadcast malicious ads to consumers...It&#x27;s actually worse than that. If they were neutrally broadcasting, they&#x27;d at least have the argument that they were conceptually just a common carrier providing a neutral conduit between advertisers and consumers. But they are actively selecting which ads to present to which consumers---with respect to scam ads, they are preferentially sending scams to the people they believe are most likely to fall for them, and profiting as a result. They are not neutral conduits, but active participants in the underlying fraud.Note that Section 230 only means they are not treated as a publisher or speaker of the fraudulent offer. That does not mean that they could not be held liable for an independent act in furtherance of the fraud, such as identifying vulnerable targets in collusion with the scammers and preferentially presenting the fraud to those targets. reply FirmwareBurner 18 hours agorootparentIndeed, you&#x27;re right, I missed that. Big-tech&#x27;s targeted advertising tech makes their scam ads way more dangerous to the targeted individuals, than similar scams broadcasted blindly to gen-pop on radio and TV.It&#x27;s kind of like the difference between a WW2-era dumb bomb and a modern GPS & laser-guided smart bomb.

You are either paying user or a supplier of product, both of which are providing something of value to the company in exchange for what they provide you. The \"product\" witticism is a bad presentation of the problem, both mistaking the source of distinction (presenting it as pay vs. not-pay) and the nature of the issue (presenting it as product vs. customer.) It&#x27;s related to another overused and misleading statement, the idea that \"the customer is always right\" is a general principle (when, in fact, it very much is not and businesses actively work to drive out undesirable paying customers, and strategically neglect the particular interest of others, all the time.)The real issue is that if you are a small, replaceable fraction of a broad set of people from whom a firm can get the same thing of value -- whether its attention to ads, or a small monthly payment, or whatever -- there is very little reason for the company to expend effort catering to things that will keep you in particular (rather than the broad group as a whole) happy and willing to supply the thing of value in question, and if you are part of a particularly demanding subset of that group, placing a high demand on resources but from which the firm is not able to extract greater value by market segmentation, then the firm is quite likely to not only not want to expend much to satisfy you, but is likely to actively wish to drive you off as a customer.The real issue is that you are a commodity vendor seeking to influence a large buyer (or a commoditized purchaser trying to influence a large seller), not that you are \"product\" or that you aren&#x27;t \"paying money\". reply CamperBob2 15 hours agorootparentprevNice moving the goalposts! ...I&#x27;ll type slowly this time to make it easier to understand: I don&#x27;t care about ads on other sites, I only care about avoiding them on YouTube, and YouTube Premium currently works fine for that.It&#x27;s OK if they \"spy\" on me to keep the other ads relevant, but that&#x27;s not the subject of this thread. reply wredue 11 hours agorootparentOkay?The point is that the claim that “paying for premium means you’re no longer the product” is absolutely, and demonstrably bullshit.Now you’re just giving money to Google for you to be the product, with a side benefit of (currently) not seeing Google ads.This it going to change within 16 months anyway, as Google shifts away from broad spectrum premium towards premium having different benefits, and you’ll have to have individual paid subscriptions to remove ads for specific users (not unlike twitch, where paying for prime no longer removes ads). replycaskstrength 16 hours agorootparentprevYou are not a shopkeeper being extorted for protection money, you are a (unwelcome) shop customer demanding things you don&#x27;t want to pay for while being free to go to another place. reply JanneVee 14 hours agorootparentYou haven&#x27;t followed my argument, so I&#x27;ll break it down for you.

I&#x27;m simply unwilling to pay for a service so I can opt-out predatory ads on behalf of my father.

It may be nearly impossible to relate to such a topic from such a place, but nearly != entirely, and it&#x27;s part of HN&#x27;s mandate to try. Consider this an experiment, or perhaps an advanced exercise, in community. reply ido 14 hours agoparentThank you, Dang.As someone on the Israeli left I feel like I&#x27;m between a rock and a hard place- I do not condone Netanyahu and his government and am indeed very critical of Israeli governments of the past decades. But on the other side, my 78 year old mother is fleeing to shelter every couple hours as my hometown (not anywhere near the west bank or the Gaza strip) gets hit by rockets, as do my young nieces and nephews, some of which developed psychological issues from the stress. And the stories from what people experienced on the October 7th attacks wrench my gut.At the same time I&#x27;m also sorry for the Palestinians suffering during this war, the vast majority of them civilians. I wish instead of people treating it like a football match where you to support \"your side\", they could process the nuance of opposing any violence towards civilians and support peace (with the goal of a two state solution with Israel and Palestine co-existing according to the 1967 borders and UN resolution 242).IMO this would require that both Netanyahu and Hamas do not stay in power. reply NotSammyHagar 10 hours agorootparentI wish more people had your perspective. I see a lot of us politicians who miss this basic human nuance, let&#x27;s all be against all violence and attacks on civilians - we don&#x27;t need to both sides it, just humanize our behavior. I think like you state, I want innocents, civilians everywhere on all sides to avoid violence, terrorism, bombings, this seemingly endless horror. I see many us politicians making misleading statements about wanting to say you must support destroying Hamas, and that&#x27;s all they can say, and they attack people who say we must protect innocent people - and they can&#x27;t accept any criticism about needing to protect civilians on the Palestinian side.It&#x27;s easy to over-react to an attack, and I hope people like you are able to control the reaction. I&#x27;m in the US, and it&#x27;s important to me to remind people that the US destroyed Iraq in response to 9&#x2F;11 (and Iraq wasn&#x27;t behind it, regardless of them being an evil government) and a million people died and also we bear eternal shame for kidnapping people and torturing them in black prisons during that terrible time.

Coming from a family with many war deaths over the past several hundred years, I’m thankful the violence ended with my generation. reply NotSammyHagar 4 hours agorootparentThe military doctrine, plans, aims we talked about publicly were unfortunately quite different from the reality of what happened. I&#x27;m not sure we are talking about the same thing - I&#x27;m talking about the unnecessary and unjustified invasion of Iraq. Yes there hasn&#x27;t been a world war - but in Iraq there are continuing tribal conflicts. We didn&#x27;t create an era of peace there.This article says 300k civilians died in the immediate wartime, more died in the aftermath. For example, see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2023&#x2F;03&#x2F;20&#x2F;iraq-broken-...:With little doubt, the United States broke Iraq. U.S. forces succeeded in the campaign to topple Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein... But what followed turned into a debacle for U.S. grand strategy, and a traumatic nightmare for much of Iraqi society.The war, driven by the hubris of the Bush administration and a supportive Washington establishment — as well as what has to be described at this point as a vengeful post-9&#x2F;11 bloodlust that permeated American society — is now widely seen as a generational American mistake. ... According to Brown University’s Costs of War project, many of the 306,000 estimated deaths in the Iraq war were of civilians killed by “direct war related violence” between 2003 and 2019, a span of time that saw Iraq convulsed by waves of insurgencies and counterinsurgencies, and its cities ravaged by terrorist attacks and airstrikes.The consensus now, even among formerly hawkish Republicans, is that the United States should never have invaded Iraq 20 years ago. ...“Iraq quickly fell prey to chaos, conflict and instability, experienced an uncountable number of deaths and displacements, and the erosion of health, education and basic services,” wrote Iraqi academic Balsam Mustafa. “Behind the statistics, there are untold stories of agony and suffering. The structural and political violence would spill into social and domestic violence, affecting women and children. With every life lost, a whole family is shattered.

They might not like their leaders but they would put new ones in power who were substantially the same.After this? Maybe. Before this, the poll above shows people wanted them out, per above. Which might make one want to ask why the Israeli leadership is so easy to goad into over-reaction and what that says about the extent to which they want peace, because given the sharp but predictable changes in polling this reaction is clearly entirely counter-productive. reply devenvdev 2 hours agorootparentFor the same reason I wish people would stop call it overreaction. As far as I see from inside Israel the reaction is considered spot-on by majority. reply vidarh 56 minutes agorootparentOverreaction is the mildest thing I&#x27;d call it. It&#x27;s an ongoing series of brutal war crimes, and if it&#x27;s true that the reaction is considered spot-on that does not make it more justified.At the same time, it is a demonstration of exactly why this reaction is counter-productive, because you can expect that exact same anger to grow in a Palestinian population where the vast majority had nothing to do with the attacks, nor have ever voted for - or even had a chance to vote for - Hamas (~80% of the current population of Gaza were either not born or not of voting age when Hamas won a minority of the vote), and who before this wanted Hamas out. Expect to see a massive resurgence in support for Hamas and even more extreme groups, and the net outcome being to have made Israel&#x27;s security situation significantly worse.It has also massively damaged support and sympathy for Israel internationally. E.g. many political forums I&#x27;m in used to see it as distasteful or too extreme to describe Israel as an apartheid state just a couple of years ago, while it is a widely supported view today, and the Israeli reaction is regularly described as ethnic cleansing with little opposition to the use of that term.Put another way: Hamas has gotten exactly what it wanted out of this, and Israel has harmed its case and harmed its security massively.If I were to make a prediction, it would be that unless Israel massively changes direction very quickly, the Israeli response to the Hamas attacks will contribute to making resistance to the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement start to crumble. reply colechristensen 1 hour agorootparentprev>support for Hamas attacks once the retaliation has stoked up hate is inherently going to be strongly affected by views shaped by the large-scale invasion and bombingIn September 2022 armed struggle was the most popular option for resolving the situation, support for that went up in Sept 2023.

[1]The change is well within the margin of error given the poll size. It is also a question that does not in any way tease out how many of those support atrocities like the Hamas attacks vs. legal and legitimate armed resistance of an occupied population against the occupier (Israel is still considered an occupier by both the UN and EU due to the extent of their control). As such it&#x27;s not relevant in response to the sentence of mine you quoted.The other survey asked a very different question, specifically on views on the cease-fire specifically in Gaza. If we&#x27;re going to compare polls that ask entirely different questions, it&#x27;s far more reasonable to interpret that as directly contradictory to support for those kinds of attacks prior to the Israeli retaliation than it is to assume abstract support for armed struggle as a long-term means to solve the conflict as a whole implies support for a specific kind of action.As it is, I stand by my claim that you can&#x27;t meaningfully say anything about the pre-Israeli retaliation views on attacks of the type Hamas carried out when interviewing a population that at that point had been subject to a full-scale invasion, extensive bombing, and many thousands dead.What we can say something about is about the specific questions people were asked in surveys, none of which to my knowledge included questions about large terror attacks on civilians.> \"32% support and 67% oppose the idea of a two-state solution\"\"which was presented to the public without providing details of the solution\" is key here. The poll I linked got 50% for “Hamas should stop calling for Israel’s destruction, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.” A key part of the problem with asking open-ended about a two-state solution is that it forces people to impose their own idea of what that would mean in terms of borders and concessions from each side. E.g. if you were to ask about a two-state solution that involves Israel maintaining control over their illegal settlements in the West Bank, you&#x27;re certainly likely to get far more opposition than the poll I linked.As such what the difference in numbers tells us is just that the exact form of a two-state solution would have a significant impact on the potential for it to lead to peace.> The older survey above did not address violence. Not liking your government does not imply that you oppose all of their general positions.I did not suggest they did. It showed people wanted Hamas out, and replaced by the PA, and wanted them to give up their independent armed units, as I stated. The statement people were asked to agree or disagree with was \"The PA should send officials and security officers to Gaza, to take over the administration there, with Hamas giving up its separate armed units\"Not wanting to give up all violence for an occupied population is unsurprising - it&#x27;d be far more surprising if most of a population of which the vast majority was born after the Oslo accords were signed yet has seen no signs of progress would believe in negotiation. It&#x27;d also be entirely unreasonable to demand of an occupied population to want to give up their legal right to armed resistance.There is, however, a vast chasm between legitimate armed struggle and indiscriminate attacks on civilians. reply mkesper 3 hours agorootparentprevSorry I think you got confused there by the unclear question in the report. The survey was conducted on 6th of October, one day before the Hamas attack (that&#x27;s written on the report page). So \"this war\" can not mean that attack or the Israeli counterattack but probably the decade long conflict. Also the survey shows people have very low trust in organisations, including Hamas. reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentThe second link they posted is about [1], which was conducted well into the retaliation. So while it is clearly about the October 7 attack, it&#x27;s also clearly massively affected by the feelings about the counter-attack.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.awrad.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;10719&#x2F;Wartime-Poll-Results-... reply sa501428 2 hours agorootparentprevFrom the article you quote, 51% of Gaza supported a 2 state solution, 75% face food insecurity, only 23% had a great deal or quite a lot of trust in Hamas, 52% had no trust at all in Hamas, most said their freedom of speech is limited or not free at all. Per the Washington Institute, 70% wanted PA to take over Gaza from Hamas in July 2023.In regards to the 60% you quote, the question was framed as \"How much do you support the military operation carried out by the Palestinian resistance led by Hamas on October 7th?\"Given the majority of Gaza has trouble accessing the news&#x2F;electricity, 95% don&#x27;t trust Israel&#x27;s news (in the same survey), what they know about Oct 7 is not what we know about Oct 7. Whether you and I believe it or not, there are plenty who think all the targets on Oct 7 were military, any atrocities are fake news, etc. And for a people suffering under blockade for 16 years, including a year of weekly peaceful protests in 2018-2019 that were repeatedly met with violence by the IDF (~200 killed, thousands maimed&#x2F;disabled), living in slums with little to no electricity [1], seeing their lives deteriorate year after year as the world has forgotten them - it would not be surprising at all for them to support a \"military operation carried out by the Palestinian resistance.\"Furthermore, we&#x27;re talking about a survey taken in the midst of war where 46% have lost their homes (same survey you shared), 80% of Gaza is displaced, and all the thousands of civilian and children deaths and tens of thousands of maiming and mutilations etc. Hospitals destroyed. Bakeries and water towers bombed. Journalists and health care workers murdered. ... Unclear how many, but probably all of the population has PTSD; 90% of the children had PTSD back in 2021 [2]. So in that context, in the midst of such immense suffering, the answer to this question should not be surprising at all. It is completely rational.However, it would not be accurate for us to conflate their answer with supporting atrocities committed by Hamas on Oct 7 (which is not something it seems the survey asked about).>> Many people on the ground support the conflict Re: Gaza, the survey you link says 90% \"support a ceasefire that includes a mutual cessation of hostilities.\" So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s accurate to say the civilians of Gaza support this conflict.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pbs.org&#x2F;newshour&#x2F;show&#x2F;harsh-living-conditions-in...

Even if they are 100% right about all the historical injustices they&#x27;ve endured, and everything was 100% Israel&#x27;s fault - it would still make no sense to \"let down our guard\", cause the direct result will be the death of multiple thousands of Israelis. dragonwriter 1 hour agorootparentprev> It is just a true fact of the world that if Israel were to let down its guard even a little, many Israelis would be killed.It is a true fact of life that many Israelis are killed, as a direct result of the Israeli government&#x27;s long-term policy of actively assuring that the most violent and extreme Palestinian faction possible is reinforced and strengthened at every turn (starting with its original creation) to maintain internal Palestinian divisions and provide a pretext to deflect domestic and international pressure to make peace. reply edanm 1 hour agorootparentYes, that was a very very mistaken plan by Netanyahu and I hope (and think) he will pay for it with this being, finally, the end of his political life.That said, what would&#x27;ve been your alternative?

His opposition to a two-state solution does not derive from any messianic conviction or biblical inspiration. While many of his supporters are religious traditionalists, he is staunchly secular and doesn’t even keep kosher. Instead, his worldview is shaped by deep pessimism. “I’m asked if we will for ever live by the sword – yes,” he told a group of Knesset members in 2015. He had absorbed this view as a child. His father, Benzion Netanyahu, was a dyspeptic historian of the Spanish Inquisition who died in 2012, at the age of 102. “Jewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts,” Netanyahu Sr once told the New Yorker’s David Remnick. For Netanyahu the son, that catastrophic vision of history has meant that nearly all matters of defence appear refracted through the lens of existential threat. According to such calculus, any Palestinian state would almost certainly devolve into an Islamist terror state threatening Israel’s existence; therefore indefinite Israeli control over the occupied territories is an absolute necessity for Jewish survival. reply la64710 9 hours agorootparentprevJust need one side to surrender to end a war. reply jncfhnb 9 hours agorootparentA group like hamas cannot functionally surrender.

Prior to October 7, a large majority of Gazans supported having the PA take over control in Gaza. It&#x27;s worth considering to what extent waning support and credibility with their own population was a motivation for Gaza in the attacks, given being seen to do something and goading Israel into making themselves be seen by the Gazan population as an obvious villain plays straight into Hamas&#x27; hands.The biggest blow Israel could deal to Hamas would probably be to do the minimum to contain them, provide the PA with access and means, and let the PA deal with it with guarantees of meaningful concessions if&#x2F;when the PA succeeds in meeting certain targets (that ought to carefully not mention Hamas, but mention things like demonstrating a functioning justice system and ability to secure the borders). To your point of a \"neutral\" foreign coalition, if granted access by Israel, the PA would potentially be in a position where it could ask for international assistance and try to frame it as allies coming to the aid of the population rather than an attack on Palestine.But that would also first take an Israeli government that is serious about peace and negotiating concessions, and frankly the current Israeli government seems as caught up in seeing the continuation of the conflict as essential to their own power as Hamas.In the meantime there&#x27;s a real danger this will stoke up more radicalism not just in Gaza but in the West Bank as well. reply boppo1 9 hours agorootparentprevIs there any way Israel could undermine Hamas with prosperity?

It&#x27;s totally legit (and morally must be done) to criticize Israel if it does bad things - but if literally every action that Israel takes is criticized as being \"too much\", the end result can only be \"Israel cannot do anything\".Btw, small language nitpick - the correct term is \"Israeli\" not \"Israelian\", at least in English. reply hef19898 1 hour agorootparentIt is tricky isn&#x27;t it?

The only way peace will happen is if there is a two state solution in which Palestinians get some land (presumably the WB, Gaza, and&#x2F;or land swaps for existing settlements that are hard to move). And Israel gets some security assurances.The only problem is that there have been no leaders on either side willing to reach such a deal, or at least, we haven&#x27;t had leaders on both sides willing to reach a deal at the same time. reply hef19898 51 minutes agorootparentAbsolutely agree on the two state solution, withe qual security assurances and existence rights for both. Otherwise it will end with a last man standing thing, and hopefully only a very small minority is actually fine with that.Re bombing: Using unopposed air power to wreck civil infrastructre is pretty much the definition of terror bombing, we can call startegic bombing if you want. Point is, this didn&#x27;t work once since it was first tried, small scale, in WW1 and at an unprecedented scale in WW2. It didn&#x27;t work in Vietnam neither. Or Iraq, the Balcans... The difference between an air strike resulting in 20 colleteral casualties and a suicide bomber (which Hamas hasn&#x27;t used so far if I am not mistaken) doing the same thing is the means and available resources.For the very same reason I am utterly opposed to drone warfare as done by the West in places like Pakistan and Afghanistan, among others. reply edanm 9 minutes agorootparent> Re bombing: Using unopposed air power to wreck civil infrastructre is pretty much the definition of terror bombingIt isn&#x27;t done to wreck civil infrastructure, it&#x27;s done to attack Hamas that is cynically using that civil infrastructure for itself.> The difference between an air strike resulting in 20 colleteral casualties and a suicide bomber (which Hamas hasn&#x27;t used so far if I am not mistaken) doing the same thing is the means and available resources.Well the intent is a big difference too. Trying to kill civilians on purpose vs. air striking valid military targets.Though yes of course, if Hamas had the means of bombing Israel with something stronger than what it&#x27;s using now, no doubt it would do so. Imagine that they ever get those means - a rocket that Iron Dome can&#x27;t stop for example - the direct result of that would be Israel being forced to attack Gaza with far more force.Also, Hamas not using suicide bomers? Are you kidding? They&#x27;ve been using them for dozens of years in order to disrupt peace processes, among other things. Even after October 7th, there have been additional terror attacks that Hamas has claimed credit for (though I think it was stabbings, not a suicide bomber specifically, not sure.) hef19898 1 minute agorootparentRe Suicide Bombers: By so far I meant in current conflict.Re bombing and airstrikes: For not having the purpose of wrecking civilian infrastructure, the Israeli airforce sure did a great job at wrecking it regardless.

But I&#x27;m afraid Netanyahu and Hamas are just tips of icebergs, and criticism at that level will not be even remotely sufficient to resolve the underlying issues. I&#x27;d love to be corrected, but it seems to me that _all_ religions (not only Judaism or Islam) are plagued by supremacist beliefs about their own ethnic group. At the ethnic group level, religion seems to be an evolutionary advantage if not a primary driving force of genetic success. But at the global, human level, it is often catastrophic. Religious apologists tend to paper over their (often subconscious?) supremacist fundamentals with moral teachings and utopian visions, but I think it&#x27;s crucial that these beliefs are publicly examined and criticized on the global stage, \"heresy\" be damned. Would be curious to hear your thoughts. reply edanm 11 hours agorootparentJudaism is very different to other religions in some ways. It is not a proselytizing religion - it&#x27;s not looking to convert anyone to Judaism.It has certain supremacist beliefs - the Jews are the \"chosen people\" of God, giving them certain duties and certain privileges. But it&#x27;s not necessarily a \"Jews are better\" line of thinking.

Lies by omission & more often than not, lying to oneself first.In my experience, having tools to expand the contextual scope is vital, if not the definition, to supporting intellectual curiosity. That&#x27;s where we seem to disagree on flagging & even downvoting. I think being able to somehow deconstruct comments to extract the insightful (& indicative) as signal over the noise in the comment would also be useful. It&#x27;s open ended on how that would be done but it&#x27;s worth exploring IMO.I think tools that improve expression, understanding, & evaluation of context are critical to improving cohesion across humanity. I am busy writing open source libraries with the intent of creating apps to support contextual expression & understanding. I hope others create & collaborate in building these sorts of tools (tech, social, spiritual, etc) because it may be one of the most important advances for healing our many divides.---> That&#x27;s where we seem to disagree on flagging & even downvoting.I think the author&#x27;s intent of expression is often not heard with the same context. So the meaning of what was spoken & what was heard is different.

There was no sleep, and the grains of rice cut their skin as they sat there, undressed.\"A man claims: \"Some people didn’t return from the torture sessions. We would hear their screams and then nothing.”From what I read, it seems typical of counterinsurgency war. A testimony is no proof but humiliation and torture is commonplace is counterinsurgency wars, whether systematic or an initiative of lower ranking soldiers operating on the ground, so it&#x27;s not an extraordinary statement. And torture can obviously lead to death.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CounterinsurgencyNow I am going to argue something polemic and I am arguing it in the spirit of discussion. I&#x27;d love to read well argued counter-arguments :However supportive of Israel one may be and how repulsed one should be by Hamas, I&#x27;d say that we should not fool ourselves in that the military operation in Gaza is Israel defending itself (\"Israel&#x27;s right to defend itself\" is now a commonplace phrase) rather than avenging itself. You may think it is justified in doing so but it still is payback imho.In my country&#x27;s law, individual self-defense is defined as such :1. It has to happen in the same time as the agression2. Its only purpose is to defend against the agression3. The defense has to be proportionateIt seems that so 1. is not met since once all the militants having trespassed having been killed, Israel was no more defending itself. and it&#x27;s hard to believe that the civilian collateral damage is just defending either. I&#x27;d say the third criteria is met in so far as Hamas has rockets and automatic weapons.Is that an unreasonable take ? reply amluto 12 hours agoparentI don’t think your take is entirely unreasonable, but I do think you’ve missed a critical detail: Hamas continues to attack Israel. So Israel’s military operation is contemporaneous with a threat, and does at least serve some degree of self-defense purpose.As I understand it (and wow, the press coverage is incomplete in so many ways), Hamas has a very large number of, approximately, these things:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Qassam_rocketAnd they fire them, on an ongoing basis, from civilian sites, at Israel. And Israel could, arguably, feel that it defending itself, contemporaneously, from ongoing attacks, thus satisfying #1 and #2. And, while the defense might not be proportionate per se, it’s not that easy to see how, from a purely tactical perspective, Israel is supposed to defend itself more proportionately. Certainly firing an equal number of rockets back at random civilian sites would make no sense. Although Israel could probably find a way for their soldiers to treat people in a much less dehumanizing way.(And I think this situation is horrible. And I suspect it’s intentional on Hamas’s part — see my other comment.) reply theautist 11 hours agorootparent>So Israel’s military operation is contemporaneous with a threat, and does at least serve some degree of self-defense purposeThere really is no self-defense purpose in my mind to what Israel is doing.

When you level entire neighborhoods, and kill thousands of women and children, and make hundreds of thousands of them homeless, do you really expect those people to start liking Israel now?

I didn’t say Israel’s actions were productive or wise, but the self-defense purpose exists.If Israel’s military command thinks of Gazans as machines or beasts, then it could see itself as doing the right thing. I personally believe that, especially when there is some form of conflict, one needs to remember that people are human, with human feelings and motivations, and consider those feelings and motivations, and Israel might act differently if its military command did so.And this leads to:> If I lost a loved one at the hands of Israel in such malicious and careless manner, I&#x27;m never going to not consider Israel as nothing but an enemy.I think this exact feeling is a large part of the problem on both sides. Both sides have killed loved ones on the other side in ways that seem intentional, callous and pointless. (Remember what started the current war, and what Israel is doing as part of this war!) So, if people on both sides share this type of permanent hatred, then they will have a hard time ever finding peace. (And neither Israel nor Gaza are monoliths. Their people, their governments, their deceased ancestors, etc are separate.

    "originBody": "FFmpeg Lands CLI Multi-Threading As Its \"Most Complex Refactoring\" In Decades Written by Michael Larabel in Multimedia on 12 December 2023 at 09:07 AM EST. 11 Comments The long-in-development work for a fully-functional multi-threaded FFmpeg command line has been merged! The FFmpeg CLI with multi-threaded transcoding pipelines is now merged to FFmpeg Git ahead of FFmpeg 7.0 releasing early next year. FFmpeg is widely-used throughout many industries for video transcoding and in today's many-core world this is a terrific improvement for this key open-source project. In recently sharing a technical presentation on the FFmpeg multi-threading effort, FFmpeg developers called this work \"one of the most complex refactoring of the FFmpeg CLI in decades.\" And in calling for testing today added, \"Please test and report issues to [FFmpeg Trac] - this is one of the most complex changes in FFmpeg ever!\" The code is now in FFmpeg Git. The patches include adding the thread-aware transcode scheduling infrastructure, moving encoding to a separate thread, and various other low-level changes. In culminating with converting FFmpeg to a threaded architecture is summed up as: fftools/ffmpeg: convert to a threaded architecture Change the main loop and every component (demuxers, decoders, filters, encoders, muxers) to use the previously added transcode scheduler. Every instance of every such component was already running in a separate thread, but now they can actually run in parallel. There's a recent presentation on this work by developer Anton Khirnov. It's terrific seeing this merged and will be interesting to see the performance impact in practice. 11 Comments",

But both hardware and software techniques have gotten significantly faster. What may have made sense many years ago (lots of workers on a frame) may not matter today when a single worker can process a frame or a group of frames more efficiently than the overhead of spinning up a bunch of workers to do the same task.But where to move that split now? Ultra-low-end CPUs now ship with multiple cores and you can get over 100 easily on high-end systems, system RAM is faster than ever, interconnect moves almost a TB&#x2F;sec on consumer hardware, GPUs are in everything, and SSDs are now faster than the RAM I grew up with (at least on continuous transfer). Basically the systems of today are entirely different beasts to the ones commonly on the market when FFmpeg was created.This is tremendous work that requires lots of rethinking about how the workload needs to be defined, scheduled, distributed, tracked, and merged back into a final output.

Wow. Now that it is actually in, it should be much easier to go forward.Big win too! This is going to really speed things up! reply ajhai 14 hours agoprevThis will hopefully improve the startup times for FFmpeg when streaming from virtual display buffers. We use FFmpeg in LLMStack (low-code framework to build and run LLM agents) to stream browser video. We use playwright to automate browser interactions and provide that as tool to the LLM. When this tool is invoked, we stream the video of these browser interactions with FFmpeg by streaming the virtual display buffer the browser is using.There is a noticeable delay booting up this pipeline for each tool invoke right now. We are working on putting in some optimizations but improvements in FFmpeg will definitely help. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trypromptly&#x2F;LLMStack is the project repo for the curious. reply kevincox 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve always wondered if better multi-core performance can come from processing different keyframe segments separately.IIUC all current encoders that support parallelism work by multiple threads working on the same frame at the same time. Often times the frame is split into regions and each thread focuses on a specific region of the frame. This approach can have a (usually small) quality&#x2F;efficiency cost and requires per-encoder logic to assemble those regions into a single frame.What if instead&#x2F;additionally different keyframe segments are processed independently? So if keyframes are every 60 frames ffmpeg will read 60 frames pass that to the first thread, the next 60 to the next thread, ... then assemble the results basically by concatenating them. It seems like this could be used to parallelize any codec in a fairly generic way and it should be more efficient as there is no thread-communication overhead or splitting of the frame into regions which harms cross-region compression.Off the top of my head I can only think of two issues:1. Requires loading N*keyframe period frames into memory as well as the overhead memory for encoding N frames.2. Variable keyframe support would require special support as the keyframe splits will need to be identified before passing the video to the encoding threads. This may require extra work to be performed upfront.But both of these seem like they won&#x27;t be an issue in many cases. Lots of the time I&#x27;d be happy to use tons of RAM and output with a fixed keyframe interval.Probably I would combine this with intra-frame parallelization such as process every frame with 4 threads and then run 8 keyframe segments in parallel. This way I can get really good parallelism but only minor quality loss from 4 regions rather than splitting the video into 32 regions which would harm quality more. reply bmurphy1976 14 hours agoparentThis definitely happens. This is how videos uploaded to Facebook or YouTube become available so quickly. The video is split into chunks based on key frame, the chunks are farmed out to a cluster of servers and encoded in parallel, and the outputs are then re-assembled into the final file. reply cudder 16 hours agoparentprevI know next to nothing about video encoders, and in my naive mind I absolutely thought that parallelism would work just like you suggested it should. It sounds absolutely wild to me that they&#x27;re splitting single frames into multiple segments. Merging work from different threads for every single frame sounds wasteful somehow. But I guess it works, if that&#x27;s how everybody does it. TIL! reply astrange 14 hours agorootparentMost people concerned about encoding performance are doing livestreaming and so they can&#x27;t accept any additional latency. Splitting a frame into independent segments (called \"slices\") doesn&#x27;t add latency &#x2F; can even reduce it, and it recovers from data corruption a bit better, so that&#x27;s usually done at the cost of some compression efficiency. reply seeknotfind 16 hours agoparentprevVideo codecs often encode the delta from the previous frame, and because this delta is often small, it&#x27;s efficient to do it this way. If each thread needed to process the frame separately, you would need to make significant changes to the codec, and I hypothesize it would cause the video stream to be bigger in size. reply keehun 16 hours agorootparentThe parent comment referred to \"keyframes\" instead of just \"frames\". Keyframes—unlike normal frames—encode the full image. That is done in case the \"delta\" you mentioned could be dropped in a stream ending up with strange artifacts in the resulting video output. Keyframes are where the codec gets to press \"reset\". reply seeknotfind 16 hours agorootparentOh right. For non realtime, if you&#x27;re not IO bound, this is better. Though I&#x27;d wonder how portable the codec code itself would be. reply actionfromafar 16 hours agorootparentThe encoder has a lot of freedom in how it arrives at the encoded data. reply danielrhodes 16 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t that delta partially based on the last keyframe? I guess it would be codec dependent, but my understanding is that keyframes are like a synchronization mechanism where the decoder catches up to where it should be in time. reply 0x457 14 hours agorootparentYes, key frames are fully encoded, and some delta frames are based on the previous frame (which could be keyframe or another delta frame). Some delta frames (b-frames) can be based on next frame instead of previous. That&#x27;s why sometimes you could have a visual glitch and mess up the image until the next key frame.I&#x27;d assume if each thread is working on its own key frame, it would be difficult to make b-frames work? Live content also probably makes it hard. reply astrange 14 hours agorootparentprevIn most codecs the entropy coder doesn&#x27;t reset across frames, so there is enough freedom that you can do multithreaded decoding. ffmpeg has frame-based and slice-based threading for this.It also has a lossless codec ffv1 where the entropy coder doesn&#x27;t reset, so it truly can&#x27;t be multithreaded. reply rokweom 16 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s already software that does this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;master-of-zen&#x2F;Av1an Encoding this way should indeed improve quality slightly. Whether that is actually noticeable&#x2F;measurable... I&#x27;m not sure. reply jamal-kumar 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve messed around with av1an. Keep in mind the software used for scene chunking, L-SMASH, is only documented in Japanese [1], but it does the trick pretty well as long as you&#x27;re not messing with huge dimensions like HD VR where you have video dimensions that do stuff like crash quicktime on a mac[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;l-smash.github.io&#x2F;l-smash&#x2F; reply rnnr 15 hours agorootparentprevffmpeg and x265 allow you to do this too. frame-threads=1 will use 1 thread per frame addressing the issue OP mentioned, without big perf penalty, in contrary to &#x27;pools&#x27; switch which sets the threads to be used for encoding. reply Hello71 16 hours agoparentprevyour idea also doesn&#x27;t work with live streaming, and may also not work with inter-frame filters (depending on implementation). nonetheless, this exists already with those limitations: av1an and I believe vapoursynth work more or less the way you describe, except you don&#x27;t actually need to load every chunk into memory, only the current frames. as I understand, this isn&#x27;t a major priority for mainstream encoding pipelines because gop&#x2F;chunk threading isn&#x27;t massively better than intra-frame threading. reply dbrueck 12 hours agorootparentActually, not only does it work with live streaming, it&#x27;s not an uncommon approach in a number of live streaming implementations*. To be clear, I&#x27;m not talking about low latency stuff like interactive chat, but e.g. live sports.It&#x27;s one of several reasons why live streams of this type are often 10-30 seconds behind live.* Of course it also depends on where in the pipeline they hook in - some take the feed directly, in which case every frame is essentially a key frame. reply kevincox 16 hours agorootparentprevIt can work with live streaming, you just need to add N keyframes of latency. With low-latency livestreaming keyframes are often close together anyways so adding say 4s of latency to get 4x encoding speed may be a good tradeoff. reply mort96 16 hours agorootparentWell, you don&#x27;t add 4s of latency for 4x encoding speed though. You add 4s of latency for very marginal quality&#x2F;efficiency improvement and significant encoder simplification, because the baseline is current frame-parallel encoders, not sequential encoders.Plus, computers aren&#x27;t quad cores any more, people with powerful streaming rigs probably have 8 or 16 cores; and key frames aren&#x27;t every second. Suddenly you&#x27;re in this hellish world where you have to balance latency, CPU utilization and encoding efficiency. 16 cores at a not-so-great 8 seconds of extra latency means terrible efficiency with a key frame every 0.5 second. 16 cores at good efficiency (say, 4 seconds between key frames) means terrible 64 second of extra latency. reply bagels 16 hours agorootparentprev4s of latency is not acceptable for applications like live chat reply kevincox 16 hours agorootparentAs I said, \"may be\". \"Live\" varies hugely with different use cases. Sporting events are often broadcast live with 10s of seconds of latency. But yes, if you are talking to a chat in real-time a few seconds can make a huge difference. reply imtringued 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can pry vp8 out of my cold dead heands.

In other words, it&#x27;s already a multi-core job. reply kevincox 17 hours agoparentLatency is still valuable. For example YouTube (which IIRC uses ffmpeg) often takes hours to do transcodes. This is likely somewhat due to scheduling but assuming that they can get the same result doing 4x threads for 1&#x2F;4 of the time they would prefer that as each job finishes faster. The only real question is at what efficiency cost the latency benefit stops being worth it. reply lelanthran 15 hours agorootparentI think that if you&#x27;re operating at the scale of Google using a single-threaded ffmpeg will finish your jobs in less time.If you have a queue of 100k videos to process and a cluster of 100 cores, assigning a video to each core as it becomes available is the most efficient way to process them, because your skipping the thread joining time.Anytime there is a queue of jobs, assigning the next job in the queue to the next free core is always going to be faster than assigning the next job to multiple cores. reply Thaxll 15 hours agorootparentprevYouTube does not use ffmpeg, at the scale at which they operate it would be too slow &#x2F; expensive.They use custom hardware just for encoding.fyi they have to transcode over 500h of videos per minute.

Potentially even variants tweaked for certain classes of device (in cases this is not already covered by combination of format&#x2F;resolution&#x2F;bitrate). I would also assume they re-compress with new advances in video processing (things like HDR, improved compression).Also, their devs likely want fast feedback on changes - I imagine they might have CI running changes on some standard movies, checking various stats (like SNR) for regressions. Everybody loves if their CI finishes fast, so you might want to compress even a single movie in multiple threads. reply sanitycheck 17 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;ll be doing VBR encodes to DASH, HLS & (I guess still) MSS which covers the resolutions & formats... DRM will be what prevents high res content from working on some \"less-trusted\" platforms so the same encodes should work.(Plus a couple more \"legacy\" encodes with PIFF instead of CENC for ancient devices, probably.)New tech advances, sure, they probably do re-encode everything sometimes - even knocking a few MB off the size of a movie saves a measurable amount of $$ at that scale. But are there frequent enough tech advances to do that more than a couple of times a year..? The amount of difficult testing (every TV model group from the past 10 years, or something) required for an encode change is horrible. I&#x27;m sure they have better automation than anyone else, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s still somewhat of a nightmare.Youtube, OTOH, I really can imagine having thousands of concurrent ffmpeg processes. reply canucker2016 16 hours agorootparentWhy bring up assumptions&#x2F;suppositions about Netflix&#x27;s encoding process?Their tech blog and tech presentations discuss many of the requirements and steps involved for encoding source media to stream to all the devices that Netflix supports.The Netflix tech blog: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F; or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.medium.com&#x2F;Netflix seems to use AWS CPU+GPU for encoding, whereas YouTube has gone to the expense of producing an ASIC to do much of their encoding.2015 blog entry about their video encoding pipeline: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;high-quality-video-encoding-at-s...2021 presentation of their media encoding pipeline: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;video-encoding-netflix&#x2F;An example of their FFmpeg usage - a neural-net video frame downscaler: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;for-your-eyes-only-improving-net...Their dynamic optimization encoding framework - allocating more bits for complex scenes and fewer bits for simpler, quieter scenes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;dynamic-optimizer-a-perceptual-v... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;optimized-shot-based-encodes-now...Netflix developed an algorithm for determining video quality - VMAF, which helps determine their encoding decisions: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;toward-a-practical-perceptual-vi..., https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;vmaf-the-journey-continues-44b51..., https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;toward-a-better-quality-metric-f... reply astrange 14 hours agorootparent> Their dynamic optimization encoding framework - allocating more bits for complex scenes and fewer bits for simpler, quieter scenes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;dynamic-optimizer-a-perceptual-v... and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;netflixtechblog.com&#x2F;optimized-shot-based-encodes-now...This is overrated - of course that&#x27;s how you do it, what else would you do?> Mean-squared-error (MSE), typically used for encoder decisions, is a number that doesn’t always correlate very nicely with human perception.Academics, the reference MPEG encoder, and old proprietary encoder vendors like On2 VP9 did make decisions this way because their customers didn&#x27;t know what they wanted. But people who care about quality, i.e. anime and movie pirate college students with a lot of free time, didn&#x27;t.It looks like they&#x27;ve run x264 in an unnatural mode to get an improvement here, because the default \"constant ratefactor\" and \"psy-rd\" always behaved like this. reply canucker2016 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re letting the video codec make all the decisions for bitrate allocation.Netflix tries to optimize the encoding parameters per shot&#x2F;scene.from the dynamic optimization article:- A long video sequence is split in shots (\"Shots are portions of video with a relatively short duration, coming from the same camera under fairly constant lighting and environment conditions.\")- Each shot is encoded multiple times with different encoding parameters, such as resolutions and qualities (QPs)- Each encode is evaluated using VMAF, which together with its bitrate produces an (R,D) point. One can convert VMAF quality to distortion using different mappings; we tested against the following two, linearly and inversely proportional mappings, which give rise to different temporal aggregation strategies, discussed in the subsequent section- The convex hull of (R,D) points for each shot is calculated. In the following example figures, distortion is inverse of (VMAF+1)- Points from the convex hull, one from each shot, are combined to create an encode for the entire video sequence by following the constant-slope principle and building end-to-end paths in a Trellis- One produces as many aggregate encodes (final operating points) by varying the slope parameter of the R-D curve as necessary in order to cover a desired bitrate&#x2F;quality range- Final result is a complete R-D or rate-quality (R-Q) curve for the entire video sequence reply astrange 10 hours agorootparent> You&#x27;re letting the video codec make all the decisions for bitrate allocation. > Netflix tries to optimize the encoding parameters per shot&#x2F;scene.That&#x27;s the problem - if the encoding parameters need to be varied per scene, it means you&#x27;ve defined the wrong parameters. Using a fixed H264 QP is not on the rate-distortion frontier, so don&#x27;t encode at constant QP then. That&#x27;s why x264 has a different fixed quality setting called \"ratefactor\". reply canucker2016 10 hours agorootparentWhat about VP9? And any of the other codecs that Netflix uses (I&#x27;ll assume AV1 is one they currently use)? reply astrange 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a codec-specific concept, so it should be portable to any encoder. x265 and AV1 should have similar things, not sure about VP9 as I think it&#x27;s too old and On2 were, as I said, not that competent. reply soundarana 8 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t two pass encoding similar? In the first pass you collect statistics you use in the second pass for bandwidth allocation?Possibly Netflix statistics are way better. reply slhck 14 hours agorootparentprev> This is overrated - of course that&#x27;s how you do it, what else would you do?That&#x27;s not what has been done previously for adaptive streaming. I guess you are referring to what encoding modes like CRF do for an individual, entire file? Or where else has this kind of approach been shown before?In the early days of streaming you would&#x27;ve done constant bitrate for MPEG-TS, even adding zero bytes to pad \"easy\" scenes. Later you&#x27;d have selected 2-pass ABR with some VBV bitrate constraints to not mess up the decoding buffer. At the time, YouTube did something where they tried to predict the CRF they&#x27;d need to achieve a certain (average) bitrate target (can&#x27;t find the reference anymore). With per-title encoding (which was also popularized by Netflix) you could change the target bitrates for an entire title based on a previous complexity analysis. It took quite some time for other players in the field to also hop on the per-title encoding train.Going to a per-scene&#x2F;per-shot level is the novely here, and exhaustively finding the best possible combination of QP&#x2F;resolution pairs for an entire encoding ladder that also optimizes subjective quality – and not just MSE. reply astrange 13 hours agorootparent> exhaustively finding the best possible combination of QP&#x2F;resolution pairs for an entire encoding ladder that also optimizes subjective quality – and not just MSE.This is unnecessary if the encoder is well-written. It&#x27;s like how some people used to run multipass encoders 3 or 4 times just in case the result got better. You only need one analysis pass to find the optimal quality at a bitrate. reply slhck 13 hours agorootparentSure, the whole point of CRF is to set a quality target and forget about it, or, with ABR, to be as good as you can with an average bitrate target (under constraints). But you can&#x27;t do that across resolutions, e.g. do you pick the higher bitrate 360p version, or the lower bitrate 480p one, considering both coding artifacts and upscaling degradation? reply astrange 11 hours agorootparentAt those two resolutions you&#x27;d pick the higher resolution one. I agree that generation of codec doesn&#x27;t scale all the way up to 4K and at that point you might need to make some smart decisions.I think it should be possible to decide in one shot in the codec though. My memory is that codecs (image and video) have tried implementing scalable resolutions before, but it didn&#x27;t catch on simply because dropping resolution is almost never better than dropping bitrate. replyasveikau 18 hours agorootparentprevProbably a lot more than once when you consider that different devices have different capabilities, and that they might stream you different bitrates depending on conditions like your network capability, screen resolution, how much you&#x27;ve paid them..You could also imagine they might apply some kind of heuristic to decide to re-encode something based on some condition...

The goals are often vague and it&#x27;s difficult to figure out what is intentional and what incidental behavior (esp. with imperative code). reply ctoth 17 hours agorootparentprev> Because refactoring requires understanding, which LLMs completely lack.Interesting.Here&#x27;s a sample question I just asked the AI:We are working on a React mapping application. I am going to give you two components from this application. Our goal is to extract functionality to deduplicate codeWe can make a single base component, extract code to hooks, or any other strategy which you think is appropriateHere is travel.tsx:Here is heatmap.tsx:And here is the response:To deduplicate code and improve maintainability between the `TravelMap` and `Heatmap` components in your React mapping application, we can identify common functionalities and extract them into reusable hooks or components. Here&#x27;s a strategy considering your code:1. *Extract Common Hooks*: Both components use similar hooks for managing markers, popups, and map references. We can create custom hooks that encapsulate these functionalities.2. *Create Shared Utility Functions*: Functions like `initialViewState`, which are identical in both components, can be moved to a separate utility file and imported where needed.3. *Refactor Map Layers and Sources*: The way map layers and sources are handled is quite similar in both components. A custom hook or component to manage map layers and sources would be beneficial.4. *Generalize Popup Handling*: The popup handling in both components can be abstracted into a custom hook or a higher-order component.5. *Combine Common Styling*: Shared styles, such as `MAP_CONTAINER_STYLE`, can be moved to a common CSS module or a styled-component that can be reused.6. *Refactor Event Handlers*: Functions like `onMapClick`, `onMouseMove`, and `onMouseLeave` have similar structures. These can be part of a custom hook or a utility function with configurable parameters.7. *Legend and Live Region Components*: These components are used in a similar way in both `TravelMap` and `Heatmap`. Ensure they are designed to be reusable with different props.8. *Refactor Map Initialization*: The way the map is initialized and configured is quite similar. This can be abstracted into a custom component or hook.### Example Implementations:#### 1. Custom Hook for Map Markers:```typescript &#x2F;&#x2F; useMapMarkers.ts import { useState, useCallback } from &#x27;react&#x27;;export const useMapMarkers = (initialLat, initialLng, world) => { &#x2F;&#x2F; Similar marker logic from your components &#x2F;&#x2F; ... return { marker, onMarkerDrag, onMarkerDragEnd, updateMarkerPosition, &#x2F;&#x2F; other marker related states and functions }; }; ```#### 2. Shared Utility Function:```typescript &#x2F;&#x2F; utils&#x2F;mapUtils.ts export const initialViewState = (map, mapType) => { &#x2F;&#x2F; Implementation }; ```#### 3. Custom Hook for Map Layers and Sources:```typescript &#x2F;&#x2F; useMapLayers.ts import { useState, useEffect } from &#x27;react&#x27;;export const useMapLayers = (props) => { &#x2F;&#x2F; Logic to handle layers and sources &#x2F;&#x2F; ... return { dataLayer, patternLayer, &#x2F;&#x2F; other layer related states and functions }; }; ```#### 4. Generalized Popup Handling:```typescript &#x2F;&#x2F; useMapPopup.ts import { useState } from &#x27;react&#x27;;export const useMapPopup = () => { &#x2F;&#x2F; Popup logic from your components &#x2F;&#x2F; ... return { popupState, openPopup, closePopup, setPopupData, &#x2F;&#x2F; other popup related states and functions }; }; ```### Integration:Once these hooks and utilities are created, integrate them into your `TravelMap` and `Heatmap` components. Replace the duplicated logic with calls to these shared resources. This will significantly reduce code duplication and make future maintenance easier.### Testing and Refinement:After refactoring, thoroughly test both components to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. Watch out for any edge cases or specific behaviors that might be affected by the refactoring.For those suggestions, I might use five out of eight of them, and probably do one or two things differently. But you cannot, with a straight face, say the model did not understand. It clearly did. It suggested reasonable refactors. If being able to refactor means understanding, I guess we have understanding!I could continue with this conversation, ask it to produce the full code for the hooks (I have in my custom prompt to provide outlines) and once the hooks are complete, ask it to rewrite the components using the shared code.Have you ever used one of these models? reply never_inline 17 hours agorootparentEliminating duplication and cleaning code is a different type of refactoring than supporting concurrency, which is much much harder.Cleaning up code also follows some well established patterns, performance work is much less pattern-y.Codebases like FFMPEG are one of the kind.

I&#x27;ll assume that you&#x27;re looking for a response where someone has taken the time to read through your previous messages and also the linked ChatGPT interaction logs.What you&#x27;ve shown is actually a great example of the what folks mean that LLMs lack any sort of understanding. They&#x27;re fundamentally predict-the-next-token machines; they regurgitate and mix parts of their training data in order to satisfy the token prediction loss function they were trained with.In the linked example you provided, *you* are the one that needs to provide the understanding. It&#x27;s a rather lengthly back-and-forth to get that code into a somewhat useable state. Importantly, if you didn&#x27;t tell it to fix things (sqlite connections over threads, etc.), it would have failed.And while it&#x27;s concurrent, it&#x27;s using threads, so it&#x27;s not going to be doing any work in parallel. The example you have mixes some IO and compute-bound looking operations.So, if your need was to refactor your original code to _actually be fast_, ChatGPT demonstrated it doesn&#x27;t understand nearly enough to actually make this happen. This thread conversation got started around correcting the misnomer that an LLM would actually ever be able to possess enough knowledge to do actually valuable, complex refactoring and programming.While I believe that LLMs can be good tools for a variety of usecases, they have to be used in short bursts. Since their output is fundamentally unreliable, someone always has to read -- then comprehend -- its output. Giving it too much context and then prompting it in such a way to align its next token prediction with a complex outcome is a highly variable and unstable process. If it outputs millions of tokens, how is someone going to actually review all of this?In my experience using ChatGPT, GPT4, and a few other LLMs, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s pretty good at coming up with little bits to jog one&#x27;s own thinking and problem solving.

At the end of the day, the government is on the hook for rolling out money when there are major disasters, so why not just start there instead of backstop there? How about we pool all our money in one big place (the government) instead of spreading it around in a bunch of smaller pools with different rules (private insurance).In 1945, the government of Saskatchewan (Canada) recognized this and has been handling province wide insurance since then (Health, Home, Auto, etc). This has meant drastically lower insurance rates, because they aim to operate with no profit, and you don&#x27;t have insurance companies suing each other for damages because everyone has the same insurance company. It creates lots of jobs, and better service for the residents.States like Florida, California, North Carolina, and others have had to start their own insurance companies to handle residents who cannot get fire&#x2F;flood&#x2F;hurricane&#x2F;etc insurance from a private insurance company because the private insurance companies have decided the risk is too high.It seems silly to maintain this broken patchwork system when there are several examples of governments creating entities to handle these ubiquitous needs in a better way. reply ProllyInfamous 14 hours agorootparentWhat a revelatory comparison, hidden entirely [from my Republican-led-state upbringing] in plain sight.

There&#x27;s only 1 or 2 CPEs, a handful of distribution gear types, and a much smaller network. As a result, the support cost is much cheaper, more stable, and less prone to failure from equipment damage. These networks aren&#x27;t traversing over 40, 50, 60 year old coax or 80, 90, 100 year old copper, it&#x27;s fiber all the way down.- Profit as a motive for the ISP is purely to pay for the costs of the service. Wages, equipment, investment in the service. Without a need to spread dividends to investors, and those investors leading a board to shift the motive of the service provider to generate revenue as a first priority, pricing priorities can be much more simple. This also mitigates choices to stay on existing infrastructure to squeeze more money purely for the purposes of paying more dividends. Those choices will happen, but they should be to buy time for the next upgrade that is planned.- Manufactured monopolies by virtue of connection agreements (Cable provider X is allowed to have a monopoly as a service provider for a municipality so long as they provide service to N% users) have turned out to be a poor incentive to provide up to date, quality, affordable service as the service matures. New fiber providers, whether muni or independent, seem to be taking a much more sustainable approach to buildout and growth. As a result, because they are capturing the market by virtue of a better product, at a better price, whenever these ISPs onboard a new neighborhood, they have to do what they do well to retain the subscriber base, because the alternatives may not be as good, but they&#x27;re not awful. reply delecti 13 hours agorootparentprevISPs largely don&#x27;t compete.

For insurance, you want the pool to be as large as possible to amortize risk over. For distribution networks, you don&#x27;t want two networks covering the same area.When that happens, the most important thing is ensuring the monopoly is run well, for which strict regulations are a must. You must define a mission independent of profit seeking, requirements that must be met, and be able to hold people responsible if they fail to meet the requirements or succumb to excessive greed.After that it&#x27;s largely irrelevant whether the entity providing the monopoly service is private or public. reply warble 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t see any free markets? reply kevingadd 13 hours agorootparentprevThe telecom market isn&#x27;t free, that&#x27;s why reply thomastjeffery 10 hours agoparentprevI live in SLC.

In the beginning, I was paying $35 for 25&#x2F;5 through Comcast. It was fine, did everything I needed. But then, roughly once a year, for a few years in a row, they would announce a speed increase on my plan, complete with a flyer in the mail congratulating me on being a loyal customer while patting themselves for being such a fine, generous company.A few months later, like clockwork, a plain black-and-white letter would be attached to my bill informing me of a change in the price of my plan due to unspecified business and economic factors.I am literally on their lowest plan, and still pay over $60 a month. That&#x27;s more than what I pay for 3 cell phones.It&#x27;s fucking sleazy and I would gladly switch ISPs yesterday if they didn&#x27;t have a government-granted monopoly in my area.

Neither of those things are motivating to me. If it&#x27;s too hard to compute the accurate tax fee per person, just roll that into your base plan calculation and budget accordingly. We don&#x27;t expect to have to pay a corporation&#x27;s corporate tax as a separate line item on the bill, so why should we expect that consumers have to pay an industry-specific corporate tax as a separate line item?At the end of the day, the reality is that this is an industry that is trying to advertise plans that are at wildly different rates from those the consumer has to pay, and they&#x27;re upset that some truth-in-advertising laws is starting to be enforced.

As we know, businesses definitely do not treat data as a commodity and engage in selling&#x2F;buying data sets on the open market as a \"genuine business tactic\".

If you&#x27;re happy with Electron, I&#x27;d say stick with it, especially if you have cross-platform plans in the future.If you want to niche down into a more macOS specific app, you could learn AppKit and SwiftUI and build a fully native macOS app.If you want to stay cross-platform, but you&#x27;re not happy with Electron, then it might be worth checking out Tauri. It provides a JavaScript-based API to display native UI components, but without packaging a V8 runtime with your app bundle. Instead, it uses a native JavaScript host e.g. on macOS it uses WebKit, so it significantly reduces the download size of your app.In terms of developing this into a product, on one hand it seems like deep integration with the host OS is the best way to build a \"moat\", but then again, Apple could release their own version and quickly blow a product like that out of the water. reply mwmercury 19 hours agoprevnext [10 more] [flagged] kolinko 19 hours agoparentAccording to your definition no program that connects using rest to a webservice is open source.

At least in that example it would be possible to reimplement the backend and make it truly open-source, but so far nobody has been able to reimplement GPT-4V in a way that it&#x27;s nearly as useful.

    "originBody": "Tutanota is now Tuta. Read more here PRICING BUSINESS WHY TUTA RESOURCES SUPPORT JOBS SIGN UP Today Is One Of The Biggest Surveillance Votes In The US. Will The FBI Finally Stop Spying On Americans? 18 companies unite to fight for your right to privacy. 2023-12-12 Today US politicians are going to vote on the FISA “Reform” Bill - the FISA Reform and Reauthorization Act of 2023 (FRRA). This bill would greatly expand the surveillance possibilities of US and non-US citizens. Privacy-first companies like Mozilla, Tuta, and the Tor Project now call on policymakers to not cement such surveillance measures with FISA 702 Surveillance. SIGN UP Ten years after the Snowden leaks the United States continues to spy on American citizens via its unconstitutional surveillance program. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) allows US authorities to spy on foreigners to prevent terrorism attacks. However, a vast amount of data from US citizens is scooped up by the NSA and regularly abused by the FBI via backdoor searches on US citizens without warrants or probable cause. This practise must end. FISA Section 702 must not be reauthorized. Open Letter Demands We at Tuta together with other privacy-first companies are making clear in a joint open letter that: Congress should not provide a blank check for surveillance overreach by reauthorizing FISA 702 in NDAA; Congress should pass a strong surveillance reform bill such as the Government Surveillance Reform Act (GSRA) or the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act (PLEWSA), and that measures such as the House and Senate Intelligence bills would only cement and expand the status quo of surveillance abuses. Simply put, the vitality of the Internet economy depends on strong surveillance reform that leave no room for backdoors. Open Letter Against FISA Section 702 Dear Members of the House of Representatives, We, a group of companies, builders, and providers of critical internet-based products and services, write to you today in support of legislative proposals, such as the Government Surveillance Reform Act, that would effectively address bipartisan and bicameral concerns around consistent surveillance overreach. We also applaud the Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, which takes key steps forward in reform, and encourage you to strengthen the bill further. Additionally, current efforts to reauthorize Section 702 until April through the National Defense Authorization Act would amount to rubber-stamping surveillance abuses, and we strongly oppose such efforts. As providers of digital products and services, both nonprofit and for-profit, we depend on the trust of our customers to sustain digital communities. If widely-documented abuses go unaddressed in legislation, individuals will remain concerned that their most intimate information could be collected by intelligence agencies without accountability, thus deteriorating the economic and social power of the Internet. While the current legislative debate may have been sparked by the imminent expiration of Section 702 of FISA, the widely-documented surveillance abuses highlighted by policy experts and members of Congress across the political spectrum would continue under narrow 702 “fixes,” especially ones that only cosmetically change FISA. For that very reason, we are particularly concerned by reauthorization proposals by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees that would only cement overbroad surveillance. A true reform proposal will need to address similar ways that the government surveils Americans without adequate oversight and accountability, including warrantless purchases of Americans’ information from data brokers, narrowing the scope of surveillance in line with the President’s own EO 14086, increasing the ability of Americans to stand up for their rights in court, and, optimally, parallel reforms of EO 12333. These provisions would ensure that surveillance overreach does not simply continue the day after a reform bill passes, but under a slightly different authority. In other words, Congress should take this “functional” approach to surveillance reform by addressing end results. The Protect Liberty and End Warrantless Surveillance Act, while not containing all of these provisions, would take critical steps forward in shielding Americans from overbroad surveillance. Most notably, it would protect Americans from warrantless data broker purchases and would create an ironclad warrant requirement for 702 surveillance of US persons, among other provisions. Lawmakers should consider strengthening the bill, for example by increasing transparency and accountability measures. Of particular importance in both bills is inserting language codifying the scope of surveillance proposed by the President’s own EO 14086 to tether surveillance of non-US persons to basic guardrails. We remain available to discuss the impact of reform proposals on the economy and on the privacy of people online as you continue your thoughtful work.

Or how can we get people to care?Once issue is that people have to understand that even if you have nothing to hide, it doesn&#x27;t matter. This level of surveillance is all about parallel construction. It&#x27;s not meant to catch you in the act of doing something illegal, it&#x27;s meant to give the government the tools they need to build (fabricate, even) a case against anyone they decide to target.Another issue is the media, and how they will pretty much always toe the government line when it comes to law enforcement. Edward Snowden and other whistleblowers are way too easily painted an enemy of the state.In general, people won&#x27;t care until it affects them, and in all honesty, this likely won&#x27;t. reply _heimdall 19 hours agoparentprevThe legal authority to surveil itself should be considered enough harm in my opinion. It fundamentally damages right to privacy, harm caused by the actual surveillance itself shouldn&#x27;t be needed if the legal system is really designed to protect our rights. reply pdonis 14 hours agorootparent> The legal authority to surveil itself should be considered enough harm in my opinion.While I&#x27;m sympathetic to this viewpoint, one should be clear about the tradeoff. One of the government&#x27;s primary duties is to keep citizens secure, from crime, terrorism, etc. That is the argument that is used to justify the legal authority to surveil. It&#x27;s not enough to just say \"protect our rights\"--the whole point is that there is a tradeoff of rights. Protecting you against crime and terrorism is also protecting your rights--your right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, if nothing else. So one can&#x27;t just say \"no surveillance\" and leave it at that; one has to make a case for why the existing tradeoff of rights is the wrong one and should be changed.Also on the subject of rights, the US Bill Rights recognizes the need for things like surveillance, searches, seizures, etc. That&#x27;s why the Fourth Amendment doesn&#x27;t say \"no surveillance, period\". It just requires that there is a warrant that specifies particular information. So if the proper tradeoff is what the Fourth Amendment describes, that&#x27;s not \"no surveillance\". It&#x27;s just stopping the abuses of the warrant process. reply _heimdall 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not proposing that we should go full absolutist and also revoke the power for law enforcement to request court-approved warrants that clearly outline what they need to investigate and why.The laws up for discussion in this thread are largely there to give the FBI a backdoor to surveil the general public without requesting a warrant with clear details on what they&#x27;re looking for and where they can look.Personally I have a much higher bar than most and think view the tradeoffs of privacy invasion rarely worth it, though I also don&#x27;t expect our government to protect me in any meaningful way and would rather depend on my fellow citizens for that instead. There&#x27;s a whole discussion there related to the surveillance and military state we live in today, but that probably veers way to far off topic. reply pdonis 11 hours agorootparent> The laws up for discussion in this thread are largely there to give the FBI a backdoor to surveil the general public without requesting a warrant with clear details on what they&#x27;re looking for and where they can look.Yes, if we restrict discussion to warrantless surveillance then I think the restrictions ought to be much tighter.> I also don&#x27;t expect our government to protect me in any meaningful way and would rather depend on my fellow citizens for that instead.In some respects this is already part of our legal framework: for example, there have been multiple court rulings at multiple levels that the police do not have a duty to protect individual citizens from crime.However, the public policies adopted by the government regarding crime can have a huge effect on overall crime rates, which in turn affects how much you need* a means of protection other than the government&#x27;s overall police powers. This is more a matter of state and local governments than federal, but even here federal policies have an effect.Also, I didn&#x27;t limit government protection to police vs. ordinary crime. Government also has responsibility for national defense, border control, gathering intelligence abroad, preventing terrorism, etc. reply _heimdall 8 hours agorootparent> Also, I didn&#x27;t limit government protection to police vs. ordinary crime. Government also has responsibility for national defense, border control, gathering intelligence abroad, preventing terrorism, etc.Sounds like we largely agree on the earlier points, this where it gets to my admittedly less common&#x2F;popular opinions. I don&#x27;t agree with standing militaries, if we&#x27;re under direct threat and our people are willing to fight then the government&#x27;s role should be to coordinate and supply this effort.I also don&#x27;t agree with most border controls, before enforcing solid borders we should have melted down the Statue of Liberty and sent it back to France (who ironically also doesn&#x27;t believe in sending them your hungry, poor, or weak anymore). We continue to chase our tails attempting to close borders but never seriously consider the motivations leading to mass migration. If we can&#x27;t feasibly close our borders we need to reconsider whether entitlement programs are worth the tradeoff and sustainable when someone can walk across the border and add to those budgets. I really don&#x27;t mean to say I have the answer on what we should do, only that there&#x27;s a fundamental challenge between wanting to ensure access to what we deem as core necessities when all it takes is physically being here and we can&#x27;t effectively control borders.With regards to terrorism, I&#x27;m of the opinion that terrorism can&#x27;t be defeated through primarily military means. Terrorism is a form of psychological warfare against a population, you defeat that by not allowing one-off attacks to stoke fear and drive to over reactions. If we only learned one lesson from two decades of war in Afghanistan it should be that, when it comes to non-state actors, cutting off one head does in fact lead to multiple new heads popping up. reply pdonis 7 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t agree with standing militariesThe libertarian in me doesn&#x27;t either.

You appear to have a similar view.> I&#x27;m of the opinion that terrorism can&#x27;t be defeated through primarily military means.I don&#x27;t think this is true. What is true that, to defeat terrorism militarily, you have to be willing to let your military do whatever is necessary to accomplish that mission, rather than hamstringing it with completely unrealistic rules of engagement. The French, for example, had no trouble defeating terrorism in Algeria militarily. They did it by, for example, not caring about how much civilian collateral damage was caused when the terrorists used civilians as human shields.The obstacles to, for example, doing in Afghanistan what the French did in Algeria are political, not military.> Terrorism is a form of psychological warfare against a population, you defeat that by not allowing one-off attacks to stoke fear and drive to over reactions.Yes, and also by convincing the population, most of whom are not terrorists, that the terrorists are going to lose. If your military gets excoriated in the press every time a civilian is killed as collateral damage, then not just the terrorists, but the civilian population in their country, will understand that the terrorists are not going to lose--because you don&#x27;t have the political will to defeat them. replycultureswitch 19 hours agoparentprevAcceleration brrr reply ghostpepper 18 hours agoparentprevTo play devil&#x27;s advocate, if good internal controls are preventing abuse, why start with the foregone conclusion that there must exist \"real harms\" to find? reply vlovich123 18 hours agorootparentBecause the FBI has pinky promised to develop those and has consistently failed with violations continuing.

In contrast, little Iceland put 39 of its top bankers in jail for their role in that event.It&#x27;s true that an entity like the FBI is needed to police white-collar crime, because otherwise corporate conflicts over market share etc. would soon escalate into violent conflict (e.g. Mexican drug cartels, Prohibition-era alcohol distribution gangs, etc.), but they&#x27;ve become an organization that does more to protect the extremely wealthy white-collar criminals from prosecution than to gather evidence that would put them in jail. The fact that top-tier FBI officials so often &#x27;retire&#x27; to lucrative private positions in Wall Street firms should serve as solid evidence that the organization is corrupt.As far as why they want to retain warrantless surveillance powers that don&#x27;t require them to go before a judge and leave any kind of evidenciary record in support of that surveillance, well, would STASI have wanted to do that in East Germany, either? reply dancemethis 19 hours agoprevUS?

The whole of the Constitution espouses an idea that we, as a people, and individuals will agree to live under laws of the defined government IF the government stays in the bounds defined in the Constitution. If the government breaks their end of the deal all bets are off. In that sense SCOTUS constitutionality rulings are meaningless. If ruled constitutionality is different than the people&#x27;s understanding of the Constitution it creates a sense of tyranny. If there are too many rulings that people feel are unconstitutional they will not tolerate it. The Constitution says it is the right of the people to replace their government.

The contested statement was \"government will never willingly give up power.\" Examples of governments curtailing their powers were provided.

Government retreated from its enforcement duty and powers for a few decades. In the vacuum, private interests asserted themselves. reply todd-davies 19 hours agorootparentGreat example. Another one is state governments joining a union or federal system, such as US states joining the Union or European states joining the EU, and becoming bound by federal&#x2F;EU law. reply Xeoncross 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an interesting way to look at it; governments merging into even larger entities is them giving up power?The \"government\" isn&#x27;t a unified mind. It&#x27;s a group of individuals looking to further their career and (rarely) pursue a cause they care about. If two governments merge their law-sets into one, they aren&#x27;t losing anything - the people involved are simply being promoted and gaining a broader peer influence with more vertical growth opportunities. reply logicchains 19 hours agorootparentprev>such as US states joining the UnionThis doesn&#x27;t really count as freely joining, since half of them were forced to join by a bloody war. reply KMag 18 hours agorootparent> This doesn&#x27;t really count as freely joining, since half of them were forced to join by a bloody war.In the South, do they generally consider themselves as forced to re-join the Union, rather than having been forcefully prevented from leaving? reply madamelic 17 hours agorootparent> In the South, do they generally consider themselves as forced to re-join the Union, rather than having been forcefully prevented from leaving?I don&#x27;t think it is revisionism and maybe I am wrong on this, but wasn&#x27;t it the Confederacy who attacked the Union at Fort Sumter which kicked off the US Civil War?It&#x27;s my understanding the Union was more or less ambivalent to the Confederacy and figured they&#x27;d let things lie then the Confederacy attacked.I don&#x27;t know enough history to say whether the Confederacy was forced to re-join or whether the states asked to rejoin in light of their government collapsing (Davis fleeing Richmond, etc). My guess would be that it was more of a failed state situation where the US had dibs on propping it back up. reply soco 18 hours agorootparentprevLet&#x27;s not forget that other half joined freely a different union.

And this line works so well, regardless if the respective party did or tried anything on the European level or not. It&#x27;s the cultivated helplessness in some circles, that EU was some remote and abstract place where \"things\" happen and no one, not even your own representatives there, can move an inch.

The government had the power to say this is banned. They still have the power to say this isnt banned. It doesnt seem like any power has been lost. They just decided to use it in another way. They could change the decision tomorrow. That wouldnt be any more or less power.

Of course, there is such a thing as deregulation, it has a definition and history that doesn’t match your operative word choice of “rearranging”.To your point, I have no doubt that some deregulation has been spin for regulatory capture and&#x2F;or anti-competitive behavior.

Ron wyden tries every day to reduce mass surveillance and similar risks for OregoniansYou do get governments willing to give up power if you elect progressive democrats or libertarians. Republicans lie hardcore about wanting to do this though.

There are \"unitary executive theory\" camps in both parties. Seems to be a more dominant idea in the Democrat party than Republican from my view.

The tech and number of searches is only going to increase over time as more contracts get in on the TSA grift.I have zero doubts at some point they will also begin domestic device scans (\"just plug the handy USB-C into your device and hang tight for a few while we ~~download all its contents~~ search for terrorism!) like they already apparently do for international flights under the guise of national security and making sure you aren&#x27;t plotting something.The self-service TSA booths are to save money on their minimum wage security staff, not to relax security. It increases the amount of surveillance they can pack in by putting you individually through a chokepoint.Think of what you could do if you could lock people into a booth by themselves as they do tasks to be let out. I am being a bit hyperbolic but singling out a person in a potentially enclosed box opens the door massively to techniques such as strip searches (you don&#x27;t even have to move rooms, how convenient, thanks TSA!) and illegal searches (ugh, really, just let us do it. It&#x27;ll take 3 minutes and besides, no one will ever believe you that we asked because it&#x27;s just us here), etc.Then you get into the fun tech that is opened up by having a person isolated such as bomb detection through analyzing residue in the air, far more cameras that can be analyzed by AI&#x2F;ML (\"your left eye twitched 27% more than average: TERRORIST\") and analysts at scale, mandatory facial recognition and other biometrics collection (a big issue with facial rec is making sure no one interferes, it&#x27;s very easy to detect a face when there is only one in the room and you can have the perfect solid color background) reply teeray 18 hours agorootparent> Think of what you could do if you could lock people into a booth by themselves as they do tasks to be let out.Hey kids, welcome to the TSA escape room!

DONATE TODAY Perks include receiving twice-a-year our very special postcard packs! Next theme … “The Heavens” What Will Enter the Public Domain in 2024? A Festive Countdown At the start of each year, on January 1st, a new crop of works enter the public domain and become free to enjoy, share, and reuse for any purpose. Due to differing copyright laws around the world, there is no one single public domain — and here we focus on three of the most prominent. Newly entering the public domain in 2024 will be: works by people who died in 1953, for countries with a copyright term of “life plus 70 years” (e.g. UK, Russia, most of EU and South America); works by people who died in 1973, for countries with a term of “life plus 50 years” (e.g. New Zealand, and most of Africa and Asia); films and books (incl. artworks featured) published in 1928 for the United States. In our advent-style calendar below, find our top pick of what lies in store for 2024. Each day, as we move through December, we’ll open a new window to reveal our highlights! By public domain day on January 1st they will all be unveiled — look out for a special blogpost from us on that day. (And, of course, if you want to dive straight in and explore the vast swathe of new entrants for yourself, just visit the links above). 30 2 12 7 21 8 9 26 5 17 31 18 1 29 3 23 22 14 20 19 10 4 24 13 27 28 6 15 11 25 16 Check out John Mark Ockerbloom’s own “Public Domain Day Countdown” on Mastodon, and summarised in his blogpost.

But some IP lawyers have said that it may also make it impossible to use Steamboat Willy in the public domain because they could claim you&#x27;re violating their copyright on their bumper.Will be interesting to see if that gets tested. reply CSMastermind 10 hours agoparentThis reminds me of the copy protection on the original Gameboy.So Nintendo makes the Gameboy, and they only want authorized games to be used in the system. But how can they stop someone from looking at the hardware and making a compatible game without paying a license fee?Well, they build a check into the hardware for a specific set of assembly code on the cartridge. If your cart doesn&#x27;t have that exact assembly it won&#x27;t boot up.The code?It displays the Nintendo logo on the screen and plays their jingle.That way, if you did make an unauthorized cartridge, you&#x27;d have to infringe on their trademark in order to make the game playable. reply spicyjpeg 8 hours agorootparentNintendo wasn&#x27;t actually the first company to implement cartridge logo checks. Sega did it first with their \"Trademark Security System\" or TMSS, which worked in pretty much the same way, but then lost in a US court case against Accolade as the judges deemed that anything strictly required for games to work could not be protected by copyright or trademark law.Despite the precedent however, the same idea kept popping up in many subsequent consoles and even some non-gaming products:- The original PlayStation reads the logo that gets displayed on the startup screen from the first 16 sectors of the disc. Notably, US consoles will not validate the logo against a known good copy - possibly hinting at the fact Sony was aware of the TMSS case - but Japanese and late European models will.- Similarly, PS2 games must contain a bitmap of the startup screen logo in the first 16 sectors of the disc, and PS3 games are required to have a PNG of the original PS3 logo in their filesystem.- Xbox 360 hard drives must have a PNG of the Microsoft logo in their \"security sector\", which among other things contains a digitally signed copy of the drive&#x27;s serial number to ensure third party drives cannot be used.- macOS will refuse to boot in a VM or on non-Apple hardware unless the BIOS can provide a supposedly copyrighted (but otherwise well known) 64-character string.- The handshaking process for establishing a connection to an Oracle database server involves sending a string that clearly states it is property of Oracle and protected by copyright law. reply sn00tz00t 10 hours agorootparentprevdamn thats big brain reply andrewxdiamond 9 hours agorootparentIt also didn’t work, both technically and legally> This has however been rendered pointless once the courts ruled in Accolade&#x27;s favor in Sega v.

It would have been politically difficult at any point in the last few years as the Senate does so little. reply jcranmer 13 hours agorootparentTo expand on this point a bit, Ars Technica has some articles on the copyright extension saga. In 2019, when works started going into the public domain again in the US, they published https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2019&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-whole-years-wo... in 2018, they published https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;tech-policy&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;hollywood-says-i... which had interviews saying that there were no plans for another copyright extension term push.Of course, both times, comments were pretty incredulous that Disney would prevent Steamboat Willie from going public domain. And now we&#x27;re 3 weeks from that happening, and 1 week from the US House planning to go on recess, and there&#x27;s no sign of any bill that would extend copyright further. People who pay attention will note that Disney has seemed to prepare for Steamboat Willie going public domain: part of the short now appears as part of their film logo in movies, presumably to enable them to claim it as trademark and sue anyone who tries to upload it into oblivion. Nevertheless, I fully expect quite a few people to do stuff like upload Steamboat Willie to Youtube in January, and it will be interesting to see what the response of that is. reply jjulius 13 hours agorootparentWhere it also gets tricky is the creation of additional Steamboat Willie content - if you want to create and publish new Steamboat Willie stuff, you&#x27;ll have to be crystal clear that it&#x27;s not coming from Disney. If it looks like it&#x27;s coming from Disney, that&#x27;s when they can step in. reply jcranmer 13 hours agorootparentLegally speaking, they have a right to distribute copies. But Youtube isn&#x27;t required to accept it though, and their copyright claim system is already somewhat notorious for the degree to which non-copyright owners to try to strike down videos for claimed copyright infringement.Steamboat Willie is probably the single most famous work to fall into the public domain since Youtube started. It is (formerly) owned by one of the most famously aggressive company in protecting IP. Youtube itself is also owned by an entity that is on the other side of IP law than Disney, but definitely far less aggressive in pushing those claims. reply justinclift 13 hours agorootparentprevHmmm, is the term \"Mickey Mouse\" trademarked?As in, would a new name be needed for any new \"Mickey Mouse\" animation created using the old Steamboat Willie (mouse) character? reply kej 10 hours agorootparentMickey Mouse is trademarked as a word and as a picture and all kinds of derivatives like the silhouette of his head or the design of the eared hats. You can&#x27;t use him as a symbol of your business or to suggest that your product comes from Disney, but none of that will stop you from making a new creative work featuring Mickey as he appeared in Steamboat Willie any more than McDonald&#x27;s can stop you from writing a book where characters eat a Happy Meal. reply justinclift 3 hours agorootparentMakes sense, thanks. :) reply kevinmchugh 13 hours agorootparentprevYou have to make pains to not look like you&#x27;re representing yourself as Disney, _and_ you can&#x27;t step on anything Disney did in later Mickey cartoons reply avar 12 hours agorootparentSure you can.

They are now, so Disney realizes that it will be a harder sell. As soon as they get someone to propose a laws letters will be written. There is one thing more powerful than money in politics and that is votes. Letters to congress are a proxy for votes and so nobody will risk another extension. reply sircastor 14 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention that Disney has run afoul of both parties a handful of times over the last decade, so it&#x27;s a challenge to find support on either side. reply hinkley 14 hours agorootparentprevThe timelessness of those old cartoons has waned considerably. GenX was already getting reruns of Disney and Looney Tunes cartoons that were aimed at Boomers. As the boomers are aging out, a lot of the slices of both domestic life and leisure time in these cartoons are something alien. Women in the kitchen? Hunting rabbits? And with a shotgun? Really?Itchy and Scratchy are Tom and Jerry ad absurdum. The Flintstones were somewhere between Tom and Jerry and The Honeymooners. Most of this stuff does not deserve a replay. reply bongodongobob 14 hours agorootparentNeither of those things are alien. A world exists outside of whatever metropolis you think is the center of the universe. Millions and millions of people hunt and millions and millions of women are primary caretakers or stay at home moms. reply chownie 9 hours agorootparentI would say the world shown in those cartoons is alien to viewers of today.There were millions of hunters and millions of stay at home mothers in the 40&#x27;s during Tom & Jerry&#x27;s original run, but there&#x27;s many fewer millions now.Consider: Women jumped from a third working in 1950 to just over two-thirds (of those who have children under 6, even) working as of the year 2000.

They&#x27;re not making any money on the actual Steamboat Willie movie. We&#x27;re still a ways away from anything of even modest commercial interest from Disney entering the public domain, and even when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs does finally come into public domain, I can&#x27;t imagine it meaningfully affects their bottom line. The ability to roll into a store and just buy it isn&#x27;t going to meaningfully affect Disney. Meanwhile, they still have all the trademark control, which itself means you can&#x27;t really do anything to Steamboat Willie that would \"offend\" Disney. (I&#x27;m going to just leave that vague for now.)Meanwhile, to keep this at-best modestly interesting historical film locked up for those last few marginal drops of IP, they&#x27;ve kept the entire rest of the culture locked up. Hell of a cost society pays just for that. I&#x27;d almost rather we just grant Disney copyright in perpetuity if it would shut them up and leave the rest of the culture alone. reply coldpie 14 hours agorootparent> Meanwhile, to keep this at-best modestly interesting historical film locked upWell, it&#x27;s not just the film, it&#x27;s also everything in it, including (that design of) the characters themselves. When that enters the public domain, anyone can use (that design of) those characters for any purpose, including in their own works that have nothing to do with the Steamboat film. I can go make a platforming video game ala Cuphead using those characters and sell it. While I think that&#x27;s a good thing for society, you can probably understand why Disney doesn&#x27;t. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentThose characters are trademarked, and Disney has a good case that they are still using those trademarks. Trademark is different from copyright - it doesn&#x27;t expire, but also has more use it or lose it parts, along with defend it or lose it. Disney is doing both with most of the characters so if you try to use Micky mouse in anything you are likely to lose a lawsuit.Consult a lawyer for exact details. there are things you can do with the characters after this expires, but the rules are very complex and I don&#x27;t really understand them. reply jerf 14 hours agorootparentprevI would be unsurprised Disney has skeletal outlines of lawsuits in place already asserting that uses of Mickey Mouse from Steamboat Willie in an unrelated video game or something violates their trademark, and are just waiting to fill in the blank for the first person audacious enough to do it.I kind of expect them to win that. But maybe they won&#x27;t. Still, I wouldn&#x27;t touch Mickey with anything less than the metaphorical ten foot pole and a really, really solidly constructed LLC or other corporate structure isolating it from any other asset I care about.Note I am limiting this to just things they have clear trademark to. Grab the steamboat itself and do as you like. The soundtrack will be up for grabs. But I wouldn&#x27;t expect to be able to defend myself in a trademark suit with the claim that the Mickey Mouse I used is not copyrighted; I expect the counterargument will basically \"Yeah, but who cares? This is a trademark lawsuit\". reply coldpie 13 hours agorootparent> violates their trademarkOkay, yeah that&#x27;s fair. Thinking strictly about copyright, I think what I said is true, but you&#x27;re right there&#x27;s other IP law at play here. reply jcranmer 13 hours agorootparentprev> even when Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs does finally come into public domain, I can&#x27;t imagine it meaningfully affects their bottom line.Given that Disney is infamous for its practice of rereleasing its older films periodically and otherwise making them completely unavailable (the \"Disney Vault\"), it seems that they have a business model which is fully predicated on copyright exclusivity. reply ryandrake 10 hours agorootparentprev> That&#x27;s almost the most infuriating thing about their copyright grabs; it hardly even gets them anything of interest.

I noticed it was being sold online, although inexpensive, which made me wonder. It turned out the English text is in the public domain, and anyone can profit from it. So, why did the publisher charge for it? I wanted to read it in my native language, Polish, and the translation was not in the public domain. Additionally, I wanted to easily upload it to my Kindle, so I also paid for convenience. I know this not fully answers your question, but wanted to share my experience. reply edgarvaldes 12 hours agorootparent>why did the publisher charge for it?Why not. Easy money. reply joshlemer 14 hours agoparentprevIANAL but my understanding is that public domain material can be published in a copyright protected form, yes. For instance, Beethoven&#x27;s 5th symphony is in the public domain, but if a publisher starts selling the sheet music for it, then that content itself is still protected. So any contributions they&#x27;ve made such as annotations or formatting, cover art, etc are protected but the underlying content is not. reply JKCalhoun 13 hours agorootparentYeah, I understand that Dover books might have a copyright on, say, Moby Dick but it&#x27;s on the forward that they tackled on to Melville&#x27;s prose, not the story. reply coldpie 14 hours agoparentprevVery good question! Not an IP lawyer, but I believe the gist of it you may copy the original work, but not any sufficiently transformative derivative work, as that would gain its own copyright. So you could copy the text of a public domain book and re-publish it yourself, yes. You could also sell your copies for $10&#x2F;ea, just like the publisher you&#x27;re copying from is doing, or give them away for free, or whatever you like.The tricky bit is what its \"sufficiently transformative\" to gets its own copyright. Probably simply text printed in a book is not, so I think you&#x27;d be OK scanning and distributing such a book. But if the publisher added new footnotes or illustrations or cover art or a forward, etc, that would still be covered under its own copyright and you would have to remove them. And I could see an argument that a certain printing style (maybe a choice in font or page layout?) could be transformative, but I think that starts to be quite a stretch. reply depressedpanda 9 hours agorootparent> illustrations or cover art or a forward, etc,OT, but isn&#x27;t it called \"foreword\"? You&#x27;re the second person in this thread calling it \"forward\" which means something completely different to me, while \"foreword\" is basically a literal translation of the word for it in my native language. reply coldpie 9 hours agorootparentHey, you&#x27;re right[1]!

Just because you went to a lot of trouble (\"sweat of the brow\") to format a book probably doesn&#x27;t give you a safe copyright--although extensive annotations, illustrations, etc. probably would. reply mminer237 11 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m not your lawyer, but if the text is public domain, you can do whatever you want with it. You should be able to walk into a book store, take a photo of every page of Sherlock Holmes, post it on Facebook, and be good legally. You can legally download scans of Jane Austen novels published by Penguin last year.A publisher would only have a copyrightable claim in their original creative works. So the cover art, the foreword, etc. This would also include e-books, as the specific code for that would be copyrightable illegal to download. Only the words themselves would be free, so you would need someone to create a gratis file therefrom for you. reply mod50ack 14 hours agoparentprevYou can sell public domain materials all you want.

It&#x27;s possible that some software in that era could be unregistered. However, I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble finding a good term for that era and so I can&#x27;t quite look it up to see if it overlaps a period of time in which software might exist. Any help appreciated from respondants.Of course, for that to even matter, someone has to have a copy of the software to actually put into the public, and software utility without hardware to run it is pretty limited. reply bluGill 14 hours agoparentprevYes, but odds are you won&#x27;t live long enough to see anything useful.

Back then you had to register copyright or you didn&#x27;t have it - often that wouldn&#x27;t have been done. Then you had to re-register the copyright, which given the software wasn&#x27;t in use anymore wouldn&#x27;t have been done.

Also the company still retains the AutoCAD trademark so you cannot legally distribute modified copies of 2005 if they still contain AutoCAD&#x2F;Autodesk branding in them.That&#x27;s for 2005. For today&#x27;s software that depend on connectivity, nobody gets anything if the clients are pushed to public domain. You still lack the entire infrastructure.

At least in the United States, that’s not how copyright or public domain works. One does not need to apply for copyright to receive one, and there is no mechanism for renouncing copyright. There is a belief held by some that copyright, like many other rights, can be renounced however that theory has never been tested in court and there are several dissenting opinions from notable IP lawyers.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.copyright.gov&#x2F;help&#x2F;faq&#x2F;faq-general.html#register reply medler 12 hours agorootparentOP’s company is based in the UK, so I was curious if the UK had stronger mechanisms for renouncing copyright.

As I&#x27;ve been told by at least a couple IP lawyers, the situation may be stickier in continental Europe. Most works the US federal government creates are also considered in the public domain so it doesn&#x27;t seem that controversial a concept in the US. reply c0pium 13 hours agorootparentThe carve out for US Government work is explicitly stated in the statute. Not only does that not create a precedent for others to create copyright-free works, but if anything it makes the case that exceptions to copyright-by-default have to be explicitly defined in law.OSI approving something is meaningless from a legal standpoint, it’s just some people on the internet. Even were that not the case, creating a license is not the same as renouncing copyright. Which, again, it isn’t clear that it is possible to do under US copyright law.Edit: to be clear, MIT-0 doesn’t even attempt to renounce copyright. It merely provides slightly broader rights to holders of a license to the copyrighted work. reply herval 13 hours agorootparentprevcode under MIT-0 is still copyrighted to its original author - it just authorizes derivative work to be done without explicitly mentioning it (which is different from public domain) reply ghaff 12 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re getting into pretty meaningless distinctions though. Anyone can take the work, give no credit, and use it however they wish. Which sounds a lot like public domain.CC0 from Creative Commons does explicitly state \"place them as completely as possible in the public domain.\" It does also acknowledge that it is not always possible to fully do so because of unrelinquishable moral rights and other reasons. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;creativecommons.org&#x2F;public-domain&#x2F;cc0&#x2F;To the original point, it may well make sense to license under MIT-0 or CC0 if they want to place a book in the public domain.

Expanding on the “Software Memory Safety” CSI published by NSA in April 2023, the report provides guidance for software manufacturers and technology providers to create roadmaps tailored to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their products. Memory safety vulnerabilities are coding errors affecting software’s memory management code in which memory can be accessed, written, allocated, or deallocated in unintended ways. Types of memory-related coding errors mentioned in the CSI include buffer overflow, use after free, use of uninitialized memory, and double free. Exploiting these vulnerabilities could allow malicious actors to access or corrupt data, or run arbitrary malicious code with the same privilege as the system owner. “Memory safety vulnerabilities affect software development across all industries,” said Neal Ziring, Technical Director of NSA Cybersecurity Directorate. “Working together to set clear goals and timelines in transition roadmaps to safer programming language is critical for mitigating these problems.” In a shared conclusion, the co-authoring agencies recommend software manufacturers create roadmaps for the utilization of, and transition to, memory safe programming languages. This transition will enable memory safe programming languages to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities and reduce the products' attack surface. Recommended memory safe programming languages mentioned in the CSI include C#, Go, Java, Python, Rust, and Swift. Software manufacturers should evaluate multiple memory safe programming languages before integrating them into their workflows. The CSI includes technical and non-technical factors for software manufacturers to consider when developing their roadmap. These include picking a memory safe language, staff capabilities and resourcing, and prioritization guidance. Additional guidance includes elements that should be part of the roadmaps, including the following: defined phases with dates and outcomes, dates for memory safe programming languages in new systems, internal developer training and integration plans, external dependency plans, transparency plans, and CVE support program plans. The authoring agencies urge software manufacturers to create and publish memory safe roadmaps to plan and communicate how memory safety vulnerabilities will be mitigated in their products. The authoring agencies include CISA, NSA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), the New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) and Computer Emergency Response Team New Zealand (CERT NZ), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK). The agencies jointly developed this report as part of their Secure by Design campaign to urge software manufacturers to prioritize design and implementation practices to reduce customer risk by using memory safe languages in their products.

Most C++ applications still linked (and used symbols from) the system libc runtime.I do not write C++ with any regularity, because I like my C footguns and dont want additional layers of footguns in my code. last time I tried writing C++, it allowed you to use after free, access raw memory pointers with no validation, iterate off the end of arrays and integer overflow and underflow, all without using \"C\" style constructs.Maybe it has changed, maybe C++ is now not as insane as it used to be and smart auto magic pointers solve everything.

The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, an elephant is eaten one bite at a time, etc. Rust is just one of the easier and more effective options for a legacy codebase, with the unusual advantage of being able to slip in incrementally.

Unfortunately, that behemoth is still rampaging across the landscape.It is not only or even mostly legacy. I&#x27;m a systems programmer (in classical sense, not \"but my web service is soooo highly loaded and scalable that I will call it systems programming!\") and from what I see on the job people start new projects in C and C++ all the time. reply eternityforest 6 hours agorootparentWhy do they choose C&#x2F;C++? Is it just what they and their colleagues already know and nobody wants to be the one to push for change? Easier integration with other C&#x2F;C++ stuff? reply caskstrength 2 hours agorootparentFrom my experience reasons differ for C and C++ programmers.C programmers are often more experienced people who are used to \"simple\" language that gets out of the way. They don&#x27;t want to invest time into learning tricky language like Rust with all the intricacies of its type system, borrow checker, etc. Something simpler like Zig might work for them, but it is not on the table at the moment.C++ programmers tend to be people who spent hundreds if not thousands of hours learning its ugly corner cases, reading Meyers and Alexandrescu books, that kind of thing. Sunken cost is immense, they whole careers are built on being \"C++ experts\" and they dread to abandon it and have to learn another very complex language from scratch.And managers often don&#x27;t see value in investing time into switching projects to new language. From their PoV it is more like programmers just want to play with a new toy instead of doing \"real work\". reply jvanderbot 18 hours agorootparentprevWhy are C and C++ considered the same, in these conversations?C++ at least has tools to make life significantly more safe. I can write a buffer overflow in any language, and on the scale of difficulty, ASM-C-C++-Rust-Python covers my experience (from easiest to fuck up to hardest).Yet nobody is calling for us to rewrite everything in python. Why is the line drawn at Rust? It&#x27;s perfectly simple to trash memory in Rust. reply jerf 17 hours agorootparentBecause \"significantly more safe than C\", while true, is also irrelevant. I want safe, not \"safer than grotesquely unsafe\". Unfortunately, for all the advances C++ has made, it is still in the \"unsafe at any speed\" class. It is difficult to escape the foundation of unsafety the entire C++ edifice rests on.(At least, without further support. I consider \"C&#x2F;C++ with high quality static analysis\" to be de facto distinct languages, and while I would favor something else even so, high-quality use of a high-quality static analyzer is enough to calm me down. Things have still crept through that level of care, but then, interpreters and compilers for safe languages have had safety errors in them before too.)This is particularly true because it&#x27;s just C and C++ that are memory unsafe. If we still in 1980, we could be arguing about the gradients of unsafety, but in 2023, we don&#x27;t need to. Unsafety is not necessary at scale.As for why people aren&#x27;t asking to rewrite in Python, I partially answered that in my post. You can actually incrementally rewrite in Rust. You can&#x27;t incrementally rewrite software in Python. There is also plenty of software that can be written in C, but simply can&#x27;t be written in Python because it would be too slow. (Rewriting it in Python but oh no wait I&#x27;ll just write the slow bits in C is a no-op, practically.)As for trashing memory in Rust, by perfectly reasonable convention we generally understand that unsafe is unsafe, and that while languages can&#x27;t avoid having it, having it does not necessarily make the entire rest of the language just as bad as C. I can crash Haskell with a straight-up, genuine null pointer exception with the Unsafe module in a single line of code. We do not thereby call Haskell an \"unsafe\" language where it is trivial to trash memory. Stock Rust is far safer than C++, to the point of being not only a qualitative change, but I&#x27;d contend, multiple such qualitative changes. reply jvanderbot 17 hours agorootparentSeparating safe C&#x2F;C++ from everyday C&#x2F;C++ is not fair, in my opinion, but I get your point: If it can be abused it will be, either by accident, inexperience, or maliciousness.Once you separate C&#x2F;C++ into safe and unsafe cateogries, and admit that Rust has unsafe uses that are \"just so much harder to use\", we&#x27;re clearly defining a gradient: C&#x2F;C++, safer C&#x2F;C++ subset or maybe Unsafe Rust, safer Rust, ... reply shikon7 14 hours agorootparentSure you can use safe C++ with some effort, but the libraries you use most likely still use unsafe C&#x2F;C++. For Rust, I expect that the libraries are much safer in general. reply umanwizard 18 hours agorootparentprevRust is memory safe by default, with unsafety as an optional feature that you basically never need to use unless you’re writing extremely low-level code, need absolute maximum performance, or are interfacing with libraries written in other languages.C++ is unsafe by default.Of course it’s just as easy to write bugs in unsafe Rust as it is in C++ (actually, it’s probably even easier), but defaults matter. reply jvanderbot 17 hours agorootparentThis is a common conception, and I agree to a point. However, interfaces matter. At the interface to _literally any_ system call, unsafe starts to creep out. Either in the wrapper implementation, or in the interface _to_ the system, or even leaking through the wrapper to the caller.At that point, if we have to re-wrap everything in rust to hide the unsafety of the interfaces to the system (sockets, shared mem, etc etc), then why not just write safe cpp wrappers?Yes, people are writing memory overflows in their own code, but I&#x27;d argue 99% of the critical security bugs are actually in the unsafe interfaces. And we don&#x27;t really need a new language to fix that. We just need new interfaces.I love Rust, but using it for anything nontrivial makes the \"safe\" patina really fade. You&#x27;re quickly writing what feels like C, with MaybeUninit all over. reply umanwizard 17 hours agorootparent> At the interface to _literally any_ system call, unsafe starts to creep out. Either in the wrapper implementation, or in the interface _to_ the system, or even leaking through the wrapper to the caller.It’s quite rare to have to make syscalls directly in Rust, just like it is in c++. Most code in any large enough system is related to the internal logic of the system, not to its interface with the outside world. And when you _do_ need to interface with the outside world, you can use a wrapper (lots of the standard library is basically wrappers around syscalls; this is true in any language). And no, in Rust unsafety doesn’t typically “leak through” interfaces, unless those interfaces are buggy.> why not just write safe cpp wrappers?There’s no such thing. It’s not possible to write a safe interface to c++ code in the sense that that term is used by the Rust community. In Rust, “safe interface” means: assuming there are no bugs in the underlying code, and the client code never invokes `unsafe`, using the interface cannot cause undefined behavior. This is impossible to guarantee in c++.> I love Rust, but using it for anything nontrivial makes the \"safe\" patina really fade. You&#x27;re quickly writing what feels like C, with MaybeUninit all over.This is not true at all in my experience. I work on Materialize, surely one of the more non-trivial Rust programs that exists. We use very little unsafe&#x2F;MaybeUninit&#x2F;C-like code. Do you have an example of a codebase you’re thinking of that does this? reply jvanderbot 16 hours agorootparentOK this is reasonable. Perhaps my experience skews towards the lower-level a bit too much. And it&#x27;s also reasonable I&#x27;m misusing the language given it&#x27;s not my day job.To answer your question, I&#x27;m referring to much of the networking code in socket2 &#x2F; socket, which uses MaybeUninit when doing non-standard stuff like forming your own packets. (RAW) reply umanwizard 14 hours agorootparentYep, I definitely buy that if you&#x27;re doing very low-level stuff, C or C++ might be more ergonomic than Rust. But I don&#x27;t think that covers most of the real-world use of C++.I&#x27;m not too familiar with `socket2` but normally in Rust to construct a buffer with arbitrary bytes in safe code you would first zero it out and then write it. Using `MaybeUninit` there is presumably just a micro-optimization to avoid having to memset things to zero. reply jaisjdkaaaej 15 hours agorootparentprevAnd that&#x27;s the problem, I do have to make syscalls directly quite often, and so I dislike Rust immensely. There are literally dozens of us at least, but the only people ever talking about Rust on the internet always like to drag C into the conversation for whatever reason even though they are always C++ programmers. reply umanwizard 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair! If you are doing something low-level enough that the bulk of the work is interfacing directly with a C library (or with the kernel, in the case of syscalls) then C might make more sense than Rust. reply skitter 17 hours agorootparentprevC++ makes it very difficult to write safe interfaces. You can&#x27;t expose references, nor spans, nor variants, no shared_ptrs to things that can&#x27;t be thread-safely overwritten, nor any standard library containers nor a lot of other things. And even if you only use whatever few interfaces remain safe, the interfaces you create are unsafe by default too. As a result, these unsafe interfaces are everywhere.I&#x27;d contend that using Rust for anything nontrivial results in MaybeUninit & co being common. reply Measter 16 hours agorootparentprevI feel I have to disagree with your (implied) contention that it&#x27;s feasible to write an API in C++ that, no matter what its inputs are, cannot ever exhibit undefined behaviour.Because that&#x27;s what \"safe\" in Rust means. No memory safety errors, no undefined behaviour. reply hulitu 11 hours agorootparentprevWho operates crates.io ? reply umanwizard 10 hours agorootparentIt’s owned by the Rust Foundation. reply corethree 18 hours agorootparentprevNo I&#x27;ve seen libraries that need the user to use it by default. The wgpu library is one example. It&#x27;s not even that low level. Rust stuff is a little too safe that it influences code organization and modularity as well. reply UncleMeat 18 hours agorootparentprevPeople are calling for the use of languages like java or python when it is appropriate. Rust is just specifically mentioned (along with Swift, to some degree) when it comes to applications that have a couple of fundamental requirements that prevent the use of other languages. These might be requirements like no pausing for GC or the ability to run without a VM.Rust (and Swift) are viable languages for solving most problems that people usually reach for C or C++ to solve today and both make it considerably more difficult, by default, to introduce the most common class of serious security vulnerabilities in the modern world. reply kevincox 18 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think C and C++ are that different. I agree that C++ gives you tools to make safer abstractions, but it still gives little tools to enforce these abstractions. For example std::shared_ptr being easy to use is a great improvement as in many cases you can just use it rather than trying to prove that you don&#x27;t need it so that you don&#x27;t need to bother implementing your own reference counting.In C++ vec[999] is a buffer overflow and you can index any pointer even if it isn&#x27;t supposed to be an array. There are so many easy mistakes that can be made and aren&#x27;t obvious to a reviewer. Maybe with a very strong linter you can consider C++ very distinct from C, but by default I don&#x27;t think it is that different.> I can write a buffer overflow in any languageTry doing it in JavaScript? If so the Mozilla security team would appreciate a private disclosure. Of course it is possible in any non-sandboxed Turing complete language, but there is a huge difference between the default accessor of the most used container type allowing it vs needing to use functions in the `sun.misc.Unsafe` package or wrapping your code in an `unsafe` block. Making code that may cause a buffer overflow explicit is a night and day difference. It means that you can&#x27;t do it via a typo in the vast majority of your code, and it will grab the attention of your reviewer very quickly. Isolating the part of the code that can cause buffer overflows to a small part greatly raises the attention that is given to those areas, and greatly reduces the chance of them occurring.I don&#x27;t think that Java or Rust prevent all buffer overflows, but I also don&#x27;t think that it is possible to write C or C++ without them. Sure, it is possible to be careful and avoid most of the buffer overflows most of the time, but we and our reviewers are just human so we will never prevent all of the buffer overflows all of the time.I don&#x27;t think that this recommendation is under the impression that \"memory safe languages\" will prevent all buffer overflows, but the idea is that they will greatly reduce the number. In many situations, I would guess the majority of them, this is a good tradeoff. reply miohtama 18 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s perfectly simple to trash memory in Rust.What makes you think so?

I might be missing something, but can you give an example of such simple methods to trash memory in Rust, asking from a curiosity standpoint? reply estebank 18 hours agorootparentI would assume they mean through the use of unsafe, which is true, but in practice unsafe code is less common than people that don&#x27;t write Rust seem to think and tools like Miri help a lot to write unsafe that doesn&#x27;t write to memory locations you weren&#x27;t meant to. reply jaisjdkaaaej 15 hours agorootparentPerhaps they aren&#x27;t writing Rust because those are the people that need to write unsafe code.

My experience is that an experienced programmer can be a lot more productive quickly with Golang, since they don&#x27;t need to climb the Rust borrow-checking learning curve.

Most programmers will use a language for dramatically longer than a year, so why are the first three months such a singular point of focus?The code I wrote in the first three months of using every one of these languages was bug-ridden, unidiomatic, unnecessarily difficult to maintain, and generally terrible. Ironically, Ruby was probably the least bad in this regard. Go and Rust were probably about the same, but I’d frankly give Rust the slight edge here. C was the inarguably the worst, but it was also my first language.Subjectively and retroactively comparing things a year in, I’d wager my Rust was of the best quality (readability, ease of maintenance, speed of development, bugs per “unit of functionality”), followed by Go, Ruby, and then C. At five years, the quality of my Rust code blows everything else out of the water. My C was still terrible (partly because it was C, partly because it was still my first language). But I’d say Ruby edged out Go at this point for me.Obviously this is not only anecdata but wildly guesstimated looking back and comparing learning curves on languages at completely different points in my experience as a programmer. I’ll happily admit that Rust pulling so far ahead so quickly is as likely to do with it building off the knowledge of prior decades of professional software engineering. And that my personal experience with any of these languages is of course unique to me and my circumstances.But it just seems wild to me that people seem to focus on “getting a new person up to speed as fast as possible” to the exclusion of apparently everything else. reply jerf 17 hours agorootparentConversion friction. Very important. Arguably the reason why Haskell is not 10-100 times more popular than it currently is; the conversion friction is just too much, and even if all the tooling was perfect and the libraries were perfect and the documentation was perfect it would still have too high a conversion friction to attract a community the size of Go or C# or something. reply stouset 16 hours agorootparentI can sympathize somewhat with this argument. But it’s also kind of circular to me.Go being easy to pick up and learn is certainly a virtuous cycle insofar as it helps bootstrap a large community. And that’s absolutely happened!But that is—in my mind—more of an explanation for why Go has become so popular so quickly more than it is a compelling argument for the language itself. Haskell having conversion friction might explain its lack of adoption, and that’s certainly a great argument in a discussion about why or why not to adopt it for yourself or your team! But it seems like an overvalued axis on which people seem to evaluate languages on their own.As a counterexample: PHP classically had a reputation as being a language that was very easy for beginners to pick up. And it’s even memory safe! But it also had a reputation for having poor long-term prospects for projects written it as well as being a limiting factor in the growth of engineers using it (note: I make no claims as to the fairness of this reputation, nor to its applicability on “modern” PHP).PHP is arguably even easier to learn than Go. So why is it that virtually nobody jumps in these discussions trumpeting that? reply emporas 18 hours agorootparentprevFrom the article: \"In contrast, Rust&#x27;s explicitness in this area not only made things simpler for us but also more correct.

Maybe you could define what you mean by runtime. reply stouset 15 hours agorootparentprevI’m writing a sibling comment to answer the parent’s question directly rather than the meta-argument from my original reply.> What I don&#x27;t understand is the excitement for using Rust vs. using garbage collected languages like Golang… since they don&#x27;t need to climb the Rust borrow-checking learning curve.Because, in my experience, climbing that learning curve has made me a better programmer more than nearly any other change in my long career. And that benefit has extended to code in every language I write.The borrow checker isn’t just some hurdle to get in your way; it’s trying to tell you (awkwardly at times and perhaps less helpfully than one would wish) something fundamental about the way you think about and design programs. Internalizing that lesson can bring significant benefits on designing systems with clean boundaries that are easier to test, easier to reason about, and easier to compose.Besides that, Rust greatly assists you (through features other than the borrow checker) in building software that is correct. This means it will tell you in a much wider variety of scenarios when future code invalidates previous assumptions. This is invaluable for projects that we expect to survive for a long time since the time a project is maintained will dwarf the time it’s under active development. And it will almost certainly be maintained by someone without the full context of the original developer(s). This is true even if the maintainer is the same person who wrote it in the first place, since our mental model of a program bitrots far faster than the program itself.In practice, this aligns with my personal experience. Go projects end up with a lot of implicit assumptions that are silently violated by future work and expose bugs. They crash on nil pointer derefs. They accrue a multitude of linting tools that usually paper over some of the language’s shortcomings, but only in common cases. And they become painful to maintain as the original developers move on to other projects, with new changes grafted haphazardly into dozens of touch points instead of cleanly in one or two places. Yes, you can “easily” follow what any particular function does, but to do so you have to parse out and mentally model every minute detail, rather than being able to reason at a high level. reply estebank 18 hours agorootparentprev> Rust doesn&#x27;t even free you from the need for a runtime or standard library.Could you elaborate on this?

Safety with concurrency doesn&#x27;t exist in any language. Only rust is special in that it tries to provide safety with concurrency as well. I haven&#x27;t seen any other language besides rust actually do this.The reason is obvious. There&#x27;s a high cost to this type of safety.

Of course in practice most of the offsets are below the limit where nothing is ever mapped (on Linux vm.mmap_min_addr and seems 64k by default for me) but it&#x27;s still very possible to have such dereference to not segfault in C. That should not be possible in Go&#x2F;Java (if it is, it would almost certainly be considered a bug in the compiler&#x2F;VM). reply trealira 15 hours agorootparentWhy isn&#x27;t it possible in Go? If you can use pointers to structures in both Go and C, and you can access the fields of a structure through a pointer in both, then I don&#x27;t understand why reading a structure field through a null pointer wouldn&#x27;t cause the dereference of an address like 0x8 in both languages. reply dezgeg 14 hours agorootparentUnbounded&#x2F;large offsets are the critical part. Minimum unit where memory protection can be set is one page (4096 bytes on x86), so compiler could reasonably assume that offsets 0-4095 are always safe to dereference (in the sense that SIGSEGV is guaranteed, which can be then turned into a NullPointerException in the SIGSEGV signal handler) without a NULL check. For anything larger or array accesses, add a explicit check for NULL before dereference. reply remexre 15 hours agorootparentprev> In Java, the compiler inserts null checks before every single dereference and throws an exception for null references.Doesn&#x27;t OpenJDK install a SIGSEGV handler, and generate the exception from that on a null dereference?(AFAIK, a lot of runtimes for GC&#x27;d languages that support thread-based parallelism do so anyway, because they can use mprotect to do a write barrier in hardware.) reply trealira 15 hours agorootparent> Doesn&#x27;t OpenJDK install a SIGSEGV handler, and generate the exception from that on a null dereference?I thought I had read that they explicitly don&#x27;t do that, but I can&#x27;t find it anymore.

And you can run it on SubstrateVM which is a virtual machine also written in a memory safe language, although of course small parts like the GC need to use unsafe features.It also has other useful features like sandboxing and the ability to interop with other languages like Python or Java. Plus, it can actually sandbox native code as well because the \"languages\" that you can run on GraalVM include both wasm and more usefully LLVM bitcode, in which each individual C&#x2F;C++ allocation becomes GC-managed and bounds checked.So in terms of memory safety the Graal team are way ahead there.(disclosure: I recently started part time work with the GraalVM team, but was a long term supporter before that) reply zozbot234 18 hours agorootparentprevMost javascript engines are JIT-based and that&#x27;s hard to make safe, you&#x27;d need a complete proof that the emitted assembly is correct.

But I do agree that complaining about the recommendation because of this is completely out of topic, the focus should be on the rule that actually mandates it. reply chewmieser 19 hours agorootparentprevOh boy... Nothing is mandated here. These are just suggestions from experts. Don&#x27;t take them if you don&#x27;t want to. reply synergy20 19 hours agorootparentwait for gov contract projects mandate them in the fine prints, it&#x27;s a signal that is serious enough for anyone interested in doing any software-related business with gov, for them, this is nearly the same as &#x27;mandated&#x27; reply zaphar 19 hours agorootparentI for one would prefer that government projects set this kind of requirement. I don&#x27;t want my government software implemented in C++. If they are the customer they should require that the projects do everything they can to eliminate bugs caused by memory unsafety. Using a Memory Safe language is one of the easiest ways to do so. reply mikeyouse 19 hours agorootparentprevThat’s just a customer with requirements.. like all customers. reply 2devnull 18 hours agorootparentBut, on the other hand it’s not. The government is a virtual monopsony. One customer has unappealing requirements and you can choose not to serve them. The federal government saying don’t hire c devs will hurt c devs. C devs will be understandably dismayed by this. reply bumby 18 hours agorootparentBut this differs from the above statement that specifically referred to \"government-related business\". The \"business\" part implies a contract but it doesn&#x27;t mean all non-govt contracts need to follow suit. reply chewmieser 19 hours agorootparentprevThere actually was a mandate for government work in the past with Ada. This is not a mandate.Even that mandate did not appear to fundamentally change the landscape beyond government work. reply ethbr1 19 hours agorootparentprevLikely only if you&#x27;re building government code.Worked out well enough with Ada in 1978. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ada_(programming_language)#H... reply WaitWaitWha 19 hours agorootparentprevI agree that it is not a mandate yet. NSA does have some interesting insight and expertise they acquire in this area.Time and time again, we see experts make recommendations, then legislation and rules make it mandatory.A burning example is most of NIST special publications. NIST makes no rules, mandates and such. Yet, mandates (e.g.,DFARS, DEAR) point to the recommendation as the requirement.Right now there are two of these playing out in the cybersecurity field - zero trust and passwordless authentication.So those who down this comment, you are right, it is not a mandate. Those who up this comment, you are right, it is likely to become a mandate. reply kaetemi 19 hours agorootparentprevEasier to decompile. reply AnimalMuppet 19 hours agorootparentprevSome software needs to be NSA-certified.

I helped deal with the log4j incident at a few companies. We specifically had to patch systems that were running newer versions of Java and older versions of Spring. The exploit relied on a new method of adding code to the JVM at runtime that newer versions of Spring had locked down to prevent people from using.I’ve never seen an explanation for why this mechanism was added or what it was supposed to enable — besides enabling new exploits.Every time I’ve seen Java used for a safety critical application the justification has been entirely based on the fact that it has cryptographic libraries that are widely certified for safety by enterprises. The security people on our side were… resigned. reply hackideiomat 18 hours agorootparentprevRight, there haven&#x27;t been crazy Java exploits going around the past few months, only Rust and Go! reply papichulo2023 16 hours agorootparentprevLog4j affair was last year. Kinda funny how HN still bitch about node dependencies and how Java&#x27;s are more mature. reply lambdaone 19 hours agoprev\"Undefined behavior\" in general is a nightmare. After memory safety, the next target should be the enforcement of underflow&#x2F;overflow trapping. With the exception of the intentional use to implement modular arithmetic, underflow&#x2F;overflow should always be an error condition. reply cultureswitch 19 hours agoparentThe main problem with signed overflow being UB is that it&#x27;s an opportunity for compilers to blatantly do adversarial language lawyering against the programmer in order to enable optimisations.When it comes to unsigneds, there&#x27;s no such problem (and this is in fact the real reason why anything that can be unsigned in C&#x2F;C++ should be unsigned). reply jdewerd 19 hours agorootparentYeah. Back when machine architectures were churning so fast that compiler flexibility allowed portability that otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have happened, UB freedom was a net good. Now that those arbitrary architecture choices have stabilized, the good is no more, and the evil of optimization rules lawyering has replaced it. UB needs to go. reply kmeisthax 18 hours agoparentprevRust is already most of the way there. The default math operators still do implicit underflow and overflow, but the behavior is actually well defined: debug builds panic on overflow and release builds wrap on overflow. There is no way to get a C-style \"demons fly out my nose\" overflow.There&#x27;s also explicit arithmetic functions that let you choose your overflow behavior:* Checked: return None on overflow* Wrapping: two&#x27;s compliment wrapped overflow (the \"overflowing\" variant gives you a carry bit)* Saturating: return maximum value on overflow reply ryao 16 hours agorootparentDo you mean the C compiler&#x27;s optimization passes can do strange things to code paths that overflow? The last I checked, C would wrap on overflow too. Rust uses the same compiler backend as C, so it could very well have the same behavior emerge from compiler optimization passes. reply steveklabnik 15 hours agorootparent> it could very well have the same behavior emerge from compiler optimization passes.It can not, because \"compiler optimization passes\" is not the root cause of this behavior: it is that it is undefined behavior in the language itself. This is what gives the compiler license to make those transformations. In Rust, it is not undefined behavior, and therefore the compiler does not have the right to make those transformations for Rust code.Just because Rust uses LLVM does not mean that suddenly it inherits C&#x27;s semantics. This has actually happened (well, more specifically, C++&#x27;s semantics, C was accidentally inheriting them as well IIRC) at least one time before, but that is a bug in LLVM that was fixed. Now each language has the proper semantics here, and it all works just fine. (I am referring to the behavior with regards to infinite loops with no side effects.) reply dezgeg 15 hours agorootparentprevTry something like this with optimization on: int would_increment_overflow(int a) { if (a + 1 : 0: f3 0f 1e fa endbr64 4: 31 c0 xor %eax,%eax 6: c3 retqUsing unsigned int gives the wrapping semantics. reply logicchains 19 hours agoparentprevNot everything is a server facing malicious actors. Forcing underflow&#x2F;overflow trapping would absolutely harm optimisation and performance for use-cases where security is a non-issue. reply brookst 18 hours agorootparentI want to agree, but I’ve seen too many cases where code written for a narrowly scoped purpose finds its way into a totally different environment where the original assumptions no longer hold. Maybe it’s worth a tax on constrained use cases in the name of having fewer time bombs out there? reply alkonaut 18 hours agoparentprevHaving it as default on todays hardware is a non-starter. Few would pay say a 200% perf penalty for arithmetic unless it&#x27;s on a security critical path. So opt-in it is. And almost all languages already support that type of opt in at the global level or smaller scope. reply jandrewrogers 17 hours agoparentprevYou can have underflow&#x2F;overflow trapping today if you want it in C++. Most people don&#x27;t use it, at least not in release builds, because of the performance cost. reply trealira 14 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t catch all signed overflow. If you define a function like this: int8_t abs8(int8_t n) { return (n >= 0) ? n : -n; }Even with `-ftrapv`, evaluating abs8(-128) will produce -128, because 127 is the maximum value for a signed 8-bit integer (so trying to get 128 wraps around to -128), but this isn&#x27;t caught. However, both Rust and Ada do catch this. This article highlights this difference between C and Ada:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borretti.me&#x2F;article&#x2F;signed-integers-asymmetricalI know Rust catches it because after I read that article, I tested it with Rust in debug mode. reply jandrewrogers 4 hours agorootparentI wasn’t necessarily assuming ‘-ftrapv’. For reliable software in C++ it is pretty common to have alternative integer type implementations that provide different fully defined behaviors and guarantees than the default integer types. This became legitimately transparent around C++17 IIRC. It is more or less drop-in and mostly produces optimal codegen. Also a good way to eliminate irritating integer behaviors inherited from C.It is easy enough to crank out custom integer types in C++ these days which are arbitrarily safe that there isn’t much excuse for not doing it, particularly since generics and metaprogramming does most of the work. Outside of interfacing with syscalls, there isn’t much use for C primitives beyond size_t. reply trealira 3 hours agorootparent> For reliable software in C++ it is pretty common to have alternative integer type implementations that provide different fully defined behaviors and guarantees than the default integer types. This became legitimately transparent around C++17 IIRC. It is more or less drop-in and mostly produces optimal codegen. Also a good way to eliminate irritating integer behaviors inherited from C.I didn&#x27;t know this. I can imagine you can create your own integer types as wrappers over existing primitives, and define them so that, e.g., on signed overflow, the program aborts or wraps (and your signed integers are actually a wrapper class over unsigned integers, but with operator overloading so that they act like signed integers). Is that what you mean? If not, could you show me what you mean? reply jandrewrogers 3 hours agorootparentYes, this is one of the advantages of pervasive operator overloading in C++. You can create types that behave like primitive integral types for all practical purposes but which implement alternative behaviors like trapping overflow, blocking integer promotion, defining shift operators greater than or equal to the bit width, creating alternative casting rules, etc. However, it has not always been possible to implement this transparently in C++.This did not work well in older versions of C++ because the limited type inference meant that many common cases around different type interactions required explicit handling that made it clear you were not using native types. Around C++17 it became possible to define integer types that were almost entirely indistinguishable from the native types in ordinary C++ code.C++17 was important because it meant a lot of safety in the code base could become automagic via the type system, especially for primitive types. The code looks the same whether you are using it or not. That was a huge capability change. C++20 then generalized it to arbitrarily complex types. It is difficult to overstate how much this improves the conciseness and safety of non-trivial code. reply jcranmer 17 hours agorootparentprevThe performance cost exists largely because software doesn&#x27;t try to check for it, therefore no one tries optimizing those checks away. reply im3w1l 14 hours agorootparentprevI think the question we have to ask is why it has such a performance cost, and how we can circumvent it.There are likely multiple necessary changes for it to be fast. One part is implementing the check quickly, this could be hardware assisted. Another is addressing all the optimizations the compiler does by asuming that there is no overflow, and figuring out alternative ways to get the compiler to emit fast code. reply phkahler 19 hours agoparentprev>> the next target should be the enforcement of underflow&#x2F;overflow trappingTrapping is nonsense - in production anyway. You might use it in development to catch errors. But in production there is no way to \"fix\" an overflow if it happens and is detected, so you&#x27;d be looking to crash on trap which in some code is preferable to silent data corruption.I do lots of fixed-point math for embedded motor control. Representing rotor angle as a signed 16bit number is deeply engrained in me these days because taking differences to get a signed delta just works, and I never have to worry about rollover because it behaves exactly the way I want. ;-) While this is technically undefined behavior, I&#x27;ve never run across a compiler that worked differently. reply OrvalWintermute 18 hours agoparentprevmost consumer operating systems are inherently non-deterministic which I put right in there next to undefined behavior (some people say it is a different thing). reply conradludgate 17 hours agorootparentIt is a different thing. Non determinism is different to undefined behaviour.Undefined behaviour can cause miscompiles which can break the expected logic of a program. In the worse case, maybe the compiler optimises away your password validation because it has decided that the failure branch is undefined behaviour.Non determinism can lead to logic bugs, but it can&#x27;t magically introduce new logic into the program like UB can as part of optimising reply ianlevesque 19 hours agoprevEncouraging.

    "title": "Upgrading Postgres Database with Zero Downtime: Success Story and Strategies",
    "originLink": "https://knock.app/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-upgrades",
    "originBody": "Blog / Engineering Zero downtime Postgres upgrades 29 min read 👋 We’re Knock. We provide a set of simple APIs developers use to introduce notifications into their products, without needing to build and maintain a notification system in-house. ✅ Tl;dr: We recently upgraded from Postgres 11.9 to 15.3 with zero downtime by using logical replication, a suite of support scripts, and tools in Elixir & Erlang’s BEAM virtual machine. This post will go into far too much detail explaining how we did it, and considerations you might need to make along the way if you try to do the same. It is more of a manual than anything, and includes things we learned along the way that we wish we’d known up front. Knock relies on Postgres to power our notification workflow engine. From storing workflow configurations and message templates, to ingesting millions of logs and enqueuing background jobs, Postgres sits at the heart of everything our systems do. Our Postgres databases running on AWS RDS Aurora have been consistently reliable, performant, and extensible. This foundation to Knock’s service lets us support with confidence every customer that joins our platform. Unlike SaaS software that can be constantly upgraded in the background with little notice, upgrading relational databases like Postgres generally requires at least a reboot of the database. In the case of major version upgrades, the database often needs to shut down completely for several minutes in order to upgrade how data is stored and indexed on disk. The more data you have, the longer the upgrade will take. In Knock’s case, we have been running Postgres 11.9 since we started the company. Although it has reliably served us at every step along the way, Postgres 11.9 is being retired by Amazon’s RDS service on February 29, 2024. Without taking action (i.e. arranging a long-term support contract with RDS), teams that use Postgres 11.9 on AWS RDS will be forcibly upgraded at that point, likely resulting in forced downtime. No amount of downtime - scheduled or otherwise - is acceptable for a service like Knock. Our customers rely on us to be online 24/7. Although no service can guarantee perfect uptime, responsible developer teams work to proactively address service issues before they happen. We added this upgrade to our roadmap in June of this year, with the following constraints: Upgrade as many versions ahead as possible, skipping to the latest available version (at the time, Postgres 15.3 for Aurora). Any downtime beyond 60 seconds was completely unacceptable, and ideally we would have zero system downtime. The upgrade must happen well in advance of Amazon’s February deadline. Minimize customer impact (e.g. zero API error responses). Operationalize the process so that next time we need to upgrade the database, it is a well-established runbook. Each of our Postgres databases would need to run through this process, and going from 11.9 to 15.3 would comprise four major version upgrades. If doing an in-place upgrade for each major version would trigger downtime, doing four in a row was out of the question. In order to meet our requirements, we knew we’d have to get creative. Preparing for any Postgres upgrade More than anything, teams seeking to upgrade Postgres in any way should focus on de-risking the upgrade process as much as possible: Make a list of the risks involved in making the migration. For example: Unacceptably long downtime Data loss Changes in database performance for your application’s workload Changes in vacuum frequency or behavior Are there any replication slots that need to be migrated (this can be tricky - see below) Figure out which risks are the most critical to the project, and which ones might be the easiest to explore/rule out/fix in advance. Sort the list so the risks with the biggest impact yet easiest to address are at the top. As you develop solutions, consider your list of risks: Are there solutions that rule out risks completely? Which solutions spread out the risk over time? (So we can more gradually address each step of the migration without taking on too much risk at once.) As you work through the project, always revisit your list of risks, and keep it up to date as you learn new things - including discovering new risks! ✅ Incrementally and continually de-risk projects like this until you are confident in being able to deliver on your project goals. To plan out our upgrade, we started with Postgres’ release notes to get a sense of what was going to change between database versions. This helped us identify more risks (e.g. changes in how Postgres’ vacuum works, requirement to reindex the database when performing certain upgrades) while ruling out others. As we moved through our planning process, we maintained this list of risks, adding new concerns and updating old ones as we collected more information. While working through the upgrade, we systematically addressed each concern until we were confident we could deliver on our project goals without risking our reliability. A word about monitoring & metrics Having thorough instrumentation (thanks DataDog!) to monitor the health of your system and database makes it possible to monitor each step of the migration. A few key metrics to watch: Max TXN ID to avoid transaction wraparound - if this gets too high, your database can shut down and go into emergency maintenance mode DB CPU Utilization Waiting sessions on your writer instance Query latency API response latencies for your application At Knock, we monitor all of these metrics as well as some that are unique to our application, like the time it takes to turn an API request into a notification. Without timely metrics, you’re flying blind. Options for upgrading Postgres Part of our research process included looking for prior examples of database migrations and how the Postgres docs recommend performing an update. Here are a few strategies: In-place upgrades (a non-starter for zero-downtime upgrades) The most basic upgrade option for Postgres is an in-place upgrade. On AWS RDS, this upgrade is executed from the AWS console. When performing an in-place upgrade, AWS will shut down the database, run upgrade scripts, and then bring the system back online. Doing this often requires some preparation, including dropping Postgres replication slots, like those used to synchronize with a data warehouse or other systems. This in-place upgrade process can take anywhere from a few minutes to potentially hours or more - it entirely depends on how much data needs to be updated between Postgres versions. Often, the system is still not in a fully usable state when it comes online, and administrators must run maintenance tasks like Postgres’ VACUUM command, or REINDEX to update indexes to support the new version’s format. Because an in-place upgrade would require far more downtime than we wanted to tolerate, it was out of the question for us. A similar approach to an in-place upgrade is to use pg_dump and pg_restore to transfer the contents of a database once it has shut down. This dump & restore approach would also not work for us due to the required downtime involved, mostly because you need to disconnect all applications from the old database in order to get a reliable database backup. Even then, for large databases, it can take prohibitively long to dump and restore the database. Replication-based upgrades This approach relies on Postgres’ excellent replication primitives: the PUBLICATION and the SUBSCRIPTION. It works something like this: Spin up a new database on your target Postgres version Copy over settings, extensions, table configurations, users, etc. Set up a publication on the old database and a subscription to that publication on the new database Add your tables to the publication (there is a lot of nuance here - more below) Once it's fully replicated, run tests to satisfy any remaining risks Once you are confident in the new database's configuration, point your application at the new database Tear down the old database In the end, this is the option that we chose at Knock for a few reasons: It gave us gradual steps we could take towards a migration instead of one big upgrade We could test the new database with real workloads and real data to avoid any regressions It gave us the most control over when and how to perform the upgrade: once the new database was fully ready, cutting over to the new database took just a few seconds Although that may sound straightforward, there are several points to consider in this solution that will depend on your application & circumstances. Configuring your source and destination databases Publications and subscriptions depend on a few configuration parameters for setting up replication slots (how the database keeps track of what needs to be copied from the primary to the follower database). The Postgres docs have plenty of detail on these parameters. These parameters will need to be tuned for your particular application. For simple applications, the only change necessary is that wal_level should be set to logical. If you already use replication slots (e.g. to manage a read replica, database failover, or to keep a data warehouse in sync), then consider setting max_replication_slots and the other parameters according to the guidance in the docs. Setting up basic replication Start a new Postgres server on your target version of Postgres (in our case v15.3). Set up your desired databases, schemas, tables, partitions, users & passwords, and everything else. The target database’s tables must have an identical structure to the source database, but these tables must be empty. To get a snapshot of the database schema, run pg_dumpall on the old DB (pass the --schema-only and --no-role-passwords options to keep it focused), and then adapt that command for the new DB. You can then compare the generated SQL files to identify and fix discrepancies between the old and the new DB. It may be worth periodically comparing both databases to detect any drift, especially if you have schema migrations happening in the source database. Consider running migrations against both databases to keep them in sync. On the primary instance of the old database, run CREATE PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub;. 🚨 Although you can tack on FOR ALL TABLES and that will set up the publication for every table, we found that for large databases, this can lead to performance problems. Instead, we found it worked much better to incrementally add one table at a time to the publication via ALTER PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub ADD TABLE table_name. More on this below. On the primary instance of the new database, set up the new subscription pointing to that publication: -- Note the _sub suffix, you can call this whatever you like CREATE SUBSCRIPTION pg_upgrade_sub -- The connection string can be any standard Postgres connection string. -- More details here: -- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING CONNECTION 'host=old-db.cloud.com dbname=your_app user=root password=' -- The publication name MUST match the publication created on the old database PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub with ( -- This subscription will not start syncing until you enable it, -- which can be helpful when getting started enabled = false, -- Replication slots track the subscription's progress. -- By default, you want Postgres to manage this. -- If you don't create a slot here, you will need to supply one yourself. create_slot = true, -- Generally you want Postgres to copy the contents of each table, -- however for very large tables you may not want this option. -- More details below. copy_data = true, -- This will halt the subscription if something unexpected happens. -- This is usually because of a unique constraint violation, or -- a mismatched schema (e.g. a missing or renamed column). -- We found it helpful to halt the subscription on error so we could -- fix the problem and then resume replication. -- Errors are logged to the database's logs. disable_on_error = true ); At this point, you now have a replication pipeline from the old database to the new one. To enable the subscription: ALTER SUBSCRIPTION pg_upgrade_sub ENABLE; -- To check the status of the subscription... -- Watch out for subenabled - if it turns false, -- replication is stopped and potentially backing up on the primary! SELECT * FROM pg_subscription; -- More details on monitoring subscriptions using that table here: -- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/catalog-pg-subscription.html Choosing tables to replicate The next step in the process is to build a list of tables you’d like to replicate. You will want to add tables one at a time, watching each table until all of them are fully replicated. Later in this post we will show you how to monitor replication for all the tables. Generally, the tables will fall into three based on their disk size and the number of tuples stored in the database. Small enough to synchronize in a few minutes: These can be replicated by just adding them to the publication and refreshing the subscription Large, append-only tables: These can be synchronize by first replicating only future changes, and then separately backfilling old data from a backup or snapshot Large, frequently updated tables: These are the hardest to synchronize, and will require some extra care For us, \"small\" was any table using less than 50 GB of storage and 10 million tuples. Anything over those thresholds we considered \"large\". ❓ What is a tuple? Each insert or update to a Postgres table is stored as a \"tuple\". If a table has 3 inserts followed by 2 updates, the table would have 5 tuples. Tuples are used by Postgres’ concurrency mechanism (more in the docs). Postgres’ VACUUM procedure cleans up old tuples that are no longer needed. When we replicate a table, we replicate all of the tuples that make up the tables contents - inserts and updates. A table with a few rows but many tuples that haven’t been cleaned up will take longer to replicate than a similar table with fewer tuples. The following query can help determine the size of a database table in terms of disk space and tuple counts: SELECT relname AS tablename, n_live_tup + n_dead_tup + n_mod_since_analyze as total_tuple_count, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(quote_ident(relname))) AS simple_size, pg_relation_size(quote_ident(relname)) as size_in_bytes FROM pg_stat_user_tables; One way to prepare your source database for replication is to VACUUM your tables, which should help the source database reduce the number of tuples it needs to copy to the target database. This can help reduce the amount of time it takes to replicate a table. Before using VACUUM, consult the Postgres docs. 🤔 Why does table size matter? The time it takes to synchronize a table is directly correlated to its size on disk and the number of tuples it contains. The larger the table, the longer it takes to replicate. This is because Postgres needs to copy the entire table over to the new database, and then apply any changes that happen after the initial copy. The problem with long synchronization time is that it can prevent your primary Postgres instance from performing VACUUM operations, which can lead to degraded performance over time. Left unchecked, it can even lead to transaction wraparound and a forced shutdown of the database. For these reasons, we added tables one at a time to replication, used different strategies based on the size & write patterns of each table, and closely monitored the system’s performance to ensure we didn’t degrade our service. If migrating a table becomes problematic, you can remove a table from replication at any time, and then re-add it later (although you will need to truncate the target table and start from scratch). How to replicate \"small\" tables To migrate small tables, you just add it to the publication and then refresh the subscription: -- On the old database ALTER PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub ADD TABLE my_table_name; -- ON the new database ALTER SUBSCRIPTION pg_upgrade_sub REFRESH PUBLICATION; Postgres will handle copying the table over, getting it synchronized, and applying any further operations to the table. For very small tables, synchronization can happen in less than a second. Large, append-only tables Tables that are too large but generally append-only, with no updates (or, if updates are always on rows that are recent, like within the past week), then you can set up a separate PUBLICATION and SUBSCRIPTION following the same steps as above, but setting the copy_data option on the subscription to false. Suffix the name of the new publication and new subscription with _nocopy to make it distinct. When you are ready to migrate these large, append-only tables, you can add them to this nocopy publication, and refresh the subscription on the target using the copy_data = false option: -- On the old database ALTER PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub_nocopy ADD TABLE my_append_only_table_name; -- On the new database ALTER SUBSCRIPTION pg_upgrade_sub REFRESH PUBLICATION WITH ( copy_data = false ); We found this approach worked really well for our partitioned tables that stored various types of logs for our customers. We did not need to migrate the root of a partitioned table, we only migrated the underlying tables, and that seemed to work pretty well. Once the subscription is running, you should start seeing logs appear on the target databases table: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_append_only_table_name; -- Returns more than zero From here, you can backfill any records older than those now visible in the database using whatever means you like (e.g. pg_dump). Here is how we did it on AWS RDS Aurora: Take a snapshot of your production database in the AWS Console Restore that snapshot into a new database instance (the snapshot DB) Rename the table(s) on the snapshot DB that you want to replicate by adding a suffix like _snapshot. This prevents us having two replication pipelines feeding into the same table on the target database. Create the same table(s) on the target database with the same schema as the snapshot database. Use the same suffix as above. Create a publication on the snapshot database and a subscription on the target database to replicate these snapshot table(s) from the snapshot database to the target database Enable the subscription and monitor its progress Once the subscription is caught up, you can merge the tables together using INSERT...ON CONFLICT: INSERT INTO my_append_only_table_name SELECT * FROM my_append_only_table_name_snapshot ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING; For very large tables, this can still take several days, but because it’s all in the background it shouldn’t affect your production environment. Once the tables are fully merged, compare them to ensure a consistent row count (more on that later). Once you are confident the tables are identical, drop the snapshot table on the target DB, drop the subscription to the snapshot DB, and terminate the snapshot database instance. Large tables with many updates over most of the rows These are the hard tables. Because they have so much data in them, they can take a long time to replicate, which can affect system performance on the source database if it prevents AUTOVUACUUM from running. Because they have so many updates, we can’t treat it as an append-only table. A few points to consider: Is there any housekeeping you can do to reduce the table’s size? Have you vacuumed the table recently? Can you partition the table into smaller pieces? Do rows stop receiving updates after a reliable time frame (e.g. 1 week?) - this could be used to treat the table as an append-only table, and then after that time frame has elapsed you can backfill old rows from a snapshot. If your source database is not on PG 15 or greater, your options are limited. Follow the steps in the \"small tables\" section. Rely on the monitoring you have in place (you do have monitoring, right?) to ensure replication doesn’t degrade your service. If needed, you can rollback by removing the table from the publication, and refreshing the subscription (See below). If the table is still too big, try to start replication during low traffic times to reduce load and write activity. This will hopefully minimize the impact on your system. Large tables coming from PG 15 or greater If your source database is on PG 15 or greater, you may be able to split up replication across multiple publications (similar to partitioning or sharding). You can then migrate the table in smaller chunks, at the expense of using more replication slots. The Postgres docs have more information on setting these parameters. 🤞 Because we migrated from 11.9 to 15.3, we did not have this option available to us. As such, we have not tested this approach. Even so, as we considered our options we noticed that this approach might be possible. If you try it out, let us know, we’d love to hear how it goes! The goal is to have enough publications to split your largest table into manageable pieces (for us, this was about 100 GB of non-index data stored). We’ll assume we are splitting across three partitions in this example. The trick is adding a WHERE clause that splits up the rows handled by each subscription: -- On the source database -- For three partitions... CREATE PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub_0; CREATE PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub_1; CREATE PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub_2; ALTER PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub_0 ADD TABLE big_table -- id must be the primary key. -- Use hashint4 for int IDs, hashint8 for bigint IDs -- Use hashtext(id::text) for UUID or other key types -- If you have a composite PK, concatenate the columns together before hashing as text -- Postgres' hash functions return positive & negative numbers - we abs() the result to make it positive -- % 3 is used to pick which of three partitions. Adjust the integer for the number of partitions you will create. -- = 0 assigns rows to the first partition (zero-indexed, so we will finish with partitions 0, 1, and 2) WHERE abs(hashint4(id)) % 3 = 0; -- Repeat the above ALTER statement for each publication, adjust the where clause accordingly. On the destination database, create a subscription for each partition. You only want to migrate one slice of each table at a time. Generally, you will follow the same instructions as adding a \"small\" table, but with the extra WHERE clause added when setting up the table for each publication. In this way, you can slice up large tables into smaller, more workable pieces. Consider only using this approach if having too many replication slots is a problem: you can still add \"small\" tables using this approach, just add the table to the _0 publication without a WHERE clause. This can help reduce the number of replication slots required when migrating. Checking a table’s replication status When a table is added to a subscription, it moves through five distinct states (visible on the target database under the system table pg_subscription_rel in the srsubstate column): Initializing the table’s subscription (State code i ) Copying the table’s contents in one efficient operation (State code d) 🚨 This step requires keeping old Postgres transaction IDs around, which prevents vacuum from running effectively and can lead to system performance issues and (if left running long enough) even Postgres transaction ID wraparound which can halt the system. This is the step that requires replicating only one table at a time. Copy finished, waiting for final sync (State code f) Finalizing initial sync (State code s) Ready and running under normal replication (State code r) In order to prevent the issues found in step 2 above, we found it was necessary to add one table at a time to replication, and to closely watch the system’s performance. The worst-case scenario (transaction wraparound) must be avoided. If you get anywhere close to wraparound, it is better to abort the migration and break it up into smaller pieces. If we had created our publication using the FOR ALL TABLES option, Postgres would have started to sync our very large source database all at once, preventing automatic VACUUM operations from completing necessary maintenance. We found this to gradually degrade database performance over time, leading to increased risk to system stability. Adding one table at a time has the added advantage of allowing teams to incrementally migrate each table. Replication does come with CPU and other costs for the source and destination databases. By adding one table at a time, administrators can control how replication affects the running system. Aborting the replication of one table If you need to halt the replication of a table, you reverse the instructions for adding the table in the first place: -- On the old database ALTER PUBLICATION pg_upgrade_pub_nocopy DROP TABLE my_append_only_table_name; -- ON the new database ALTER SUBSCRIPTION pg_upgrade_sub REFRESH PUBLICATION; In an emergency, you can also drop the publications and subscriptions entirely, and start the process over. Postgres will clean up any replication slots that were created as part of the publication and subscription, which should relieve any pressure on the source database. 🚨 Be advised that if you just disable the subscription without removing the table from the publication and refreshing the subscription, the source database will continue to hold onto old transaction IDs, which can lead to transaction wraparound and a forced shutdown of the database. Just disabling the subscription will not resolve any replication-related performance problems. A note about moving replication slots Replication slots in Postgres store a log of database activity that can be consumed on another database or in another application. Postgres tracks slot progress using a Log Sequence Number (LSN). LSNs are unique to the primary Postgres database. This means that if you have a replication slot on your database (e.g. to copy changes to a data warehouse or as part of your own application), you will not be able to copy the replication slot's LSN over from the old database to the new database. You will need to consult the documentation of the application consuming the replication slot to decide how to best migrate (e.g. for data warehousing tools, they may have a way to merge duplicated information between both databases). If you’re using replication slots as part of your own application, you already know that you’re on your own to roll your own solution. Having some idempotence mechanism to deduplicate transactions from the old and the new database will definitely be helpful. Finalizing the migration Once you have added all of your tables to publications, and the subscriptions have caught up on everything, you need to now verify that the tables match. Unfortunately, eventual consistency (the lag between a write being applied to the old database and it showing up on the new database) will prevent both databases from being perfect matches at the same time, you can still count table rows to make sure you’re close enough to know it’s working. At Knock, we wrote a script that iterated through each table and asked both databases to count the total number of rows in each table on the old and new database, and compared the results. For tables with an inserted_at column, we filtered to rows older than 10 seconds. This interval is more than enough to prove that the tables match, with the assumption that the remaining 10 seconds will replicate across in short order. You may need to come up with a strategy that fits your application’s needs. We felt that as long as row counts were accurate within a few seconds, we could otherwise assume that Postgres replication was reliable. In a few instances, we also spot-checked the contents of a few tables to ensure they matched to confirm this assumption. Collecting a random sample of rows from tables and comparing them between the old and the new database can help verify that the tables are identical. Application-level changes Parallel to all of this database work, you may need to change your application to connect to both databases. When you are finally ready to cut over, you need a strategy to shift traffic to your new database. When the final cutover happens, you could change your application’s configuration to point to the new database, and then reboot your app. This is simple, straightforward, and is precisely how we migrated one of our lower-traffic databases. For applications with lots of concurrent activity, you may need to get creative. We wanted to avoid a situation with conflicting writes between the old and new database. Such conflicts could have caused a service outage for us, requiring manually reconciling database state. At Knock, we configured our application to connect to both databases. When we were ready to execute the cutover, we ran a script that did the following: Tell all instances of our application to send new queries to the new database All currently running database queries had 500 ms to complete before being forcefully cancelled For the first second after flipping the flag, our application artificially paused any new database requests for one second. This allowed pending transactions to replicate to the new database so that new queries wouldn’t have stale reads 500 ms is far higher than most of our db queries, and we saw zero errors due to forced disconnections After that first second, database activity returned to normal behavior, but pointing at the new database. In the middle of the cutover, we had some specialized database workloads that the script shut down and restarted in order to reconnect to the new database. One more thing: sequences One thing that replication doesn’t synchronize is any Postgres sequence. Sequences are monotonically increasing integers that are guaranteed to never duplicate. Unfortunately, they are not incremented on the new database as sequence values are used up on the old database. Fortunately, this is pretty easy to control for. Part of our cutover procedure was to run a script right before flipping our feature flag that did the following: Connect to both databases Get the next value of all of the sequences in the database using SELECT nextval('sequence_name') Set that value in the new database using SELECT setval('sequence_name', value::int4 + 100000) to advance the sequence and offer a little bit of buffer (in this case, 100k rows can be added between setting this value on the new database and cutting over). This will introduce a gap in the sequence, but that’s generally not a problem. For us, our sequences are bigints. 100k values skipped in the sequence is a rounding error off of 0% used up sequence values in that case. You will want to tune how big of a gap you introduce so you don’t use too much of your sequence’s usable space. If you only expect the sequence to use a few hundred values during your cutover window, then maybe advance it only by 5000. Final checklist before cutting over Here are some of the things we considered before executing our final cutover: Do the rows on all the tables match as expected? Are all the subscriptions enabled and running without error? Do the schemas match? Can you freeze any new schema migrations from being released to reduce the risk of something changing while you’re migrating? Is your new database properly sized for your workloads? Do you have to add any read replicas so the database cluster topology is the same between the old and the new database? Have you reindexed and performed basic VACUUM maintenance on the new database to ensure it’s fresh and ready for production traffic? Have you double checked Postgres’ release notes for anything that might cause a regression in your app? Have you run automated and manual tests against a staging database on the new version to verify system performance? Have you run load tests of your most demanding queries using pg_bench against your new version to verify performance? If there’s one thing that you can de-risk still, what is it? Do practice runs in a staging or test environment until you have fully exercised the cutover process multiple times. Dry runs like this will help reveal gaps in your plan before you go to production. Right before cutover, take a database backup - just in case. Cutting over At Knock, we took a few weeks replicating tables one at a time. We generally did this after business hours and during our lowest traffic time frames. We practiced cutover in our staging environment multiple times, ironing out the process until it just worked without much operator involvement. Once we had a replica running PG 15 and had the application code in place to cut over from the old to the new database, we ran one final set of checks and flipped the flag. After months of preparation, the actual cutover was uneventful: our application cut over within a few seconds, we had a brief blip of (intentional) latency as queries waited to allow for replication, and our application continued running without skipping a beat. Reading this paragraph took longer than the cutover itself. From there, we rolled back the application changes we introduced, permanently pointed everything at the new database, removed the subscriptions on the new database, and tore down the old database. We had successfully jumped from Postgres 11.9 to 15.3 with zero downtime! Conclusion Although jumping four major versions of Postgres in one leap is a painstaking process, it can be done, and in many ways it’s safer than scheduled downtime: it can be practiced, tested, and reworked multiple times before performing the actual cutover. At any point in the process, we could have dropped the publications from the old database and started over without degrading our service. Modern customers expect 100% availability. While that is not technically possible, zero downtime migrations make it easier to keep systems running smoothly without major service interruptions.

Then you upgrade your logical replica.This is a great recipe but needs small but important correction. We need to be careful with plugging pg_upgrade in this physical-to-logical replica conversion process: if we first start logical replication and then running pg_upgrade, there are risks of corruption – see discussion in pgsql-hackers https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;message-id&#x2F;flat&#x2F;20230217075433.u5.... To solve this, we need first to create logical slot, advance the new cluster to slot&#x27;s LSN position (not starting logical replication yet), then run pg_upgrade, and only then logical replication – when the new cluster is already running on new PG version.This is exactly how we (Postgres.ai) recently have helped GitLab upgrade multiple multi-TiB clusters under heavy load without any downtime at all (also involving PgBouncer&#x27;s PAUSE&#x2F;RESUME) - there will be a talk by Alexander Sosna presented later this week https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.eu&#x2F;events&#x2F;pgconfeu2023&#x2F;schedule&#x2F;sessi... and there are some plans to publish details about it. reply brentjanderson 8 hours agoparentprevOP here: we looked at this and were not confident in manually advancing the LSN as proposed, and detecting any inconsistency if we missed any replication as a result. Table by table seemed more reliable, despite being more painstaking. reply aeyes 7 hours agorootparentAs long as you have the correct LSN there is no way for this to go wrong.If you resume replication with an incorrect LSN replication will break immediately. I have spent way too much time trying to do this on my own before the blog post was written and I have seen it fail over and over again.To give you more confidence, try with the LSN from the \"redo starts at\" log message. It looks close but it will always fail. reply mmontagna9 2 hours agorootparentSadly this isn&#x27;t true. Postgres will happily replicate and skip data if you tell it too.And there have been multiple bugs around logical replication in version ~10-15 that can cause data loss. None of these are directly related to lsn fiddling tho. reply mmontagna9 2 hours agoparentprevYou caught our off by one bug :) reply natbennett 9 hours agoprevThe approach here is interesting and well-documented! However, this line gives me pause—> Modern customers expect 100% availability.This is not my preference as a customer, nor has it been my experience as a vendor. For many workloads consistency is much more important than availability. I’m often relieved when I see a vendor announce a downtime window because it suggests they’re being sensible with my data. reply brentjanderson 9 hours agoparentOP Here - that&#x27;s great feedback! Our hope is to build confidence in both the reliability of our product _and_ the consistency of the workloads. Of course, presenting the illusion of consistency while being flaky is far worse than managing customer expectations and taking intentional downtime to, in the long run, have better uptime.Indeed, having periodic maintenance windows expected up-front probably leads to more robust architectures overall: customers building in the failsafes they need to tolerate downtime leads to more resilience. Teams that can trust their customers in that way can, in turn, take the time they need to make the investments they need to build a better product.Perhaps this will be the blog post we write after our next major version upgrade: expectation setting around downtime _is_ the way to very high uptime. reply eru 19 minutes agorootparentGoogle famously turn off a critical internal service for a minute our so, because they had promised 99.999% (or something like that) of uptime, but hadn&#x27;t actually gone down in a few years.In order to make sure that (internal) consumers of that service could handle the downtime, they introduced some artificially. reply natbennett 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah I’d be a lot more confident about this if you talked some about consistency vs. availability and the details of your workload that made you want to choose this trade off.I have potentially a weird experience path here — worked with Galera a bunch early on because when we asked customers if they wanted HA they said “yes absolutely” so we sunk a ton of time into absolutely never ever going down.When we finally presented the trade off space (basically that 10 minute downtime windows occasionally could basically guarantee that we wouldn’t have data loss) we ended up building a very different product. reply gfody 4 hours agoparentprevdepends who the customer is, I&#x27;m a customer of AWS and I expect 100% availability, mostly because my customers are everywhere in the world and there&#x27;s no available window for downtime reply guiriduro 1 hour agorootparentIf you have this 100% availability expectation you&#x27;re going to have to face the reality that DBMS versions fall out of support, you will have to upgrade or AWS will force-upgrade you their way, the AWS-provided default mechanism has significant DB-size dependent downtime (in order to maintain consistency, and you really don&#x27;t want to lose that), and that the only alternative is to go through the pain of sifting through your database estate and logically replicating table by table with verification as shown in this article, with care especially for large tables and reindexing, and you can&#x27;t avoid that if you have the (IMO mostly unreasonable) expectation of 100% availability. Change the wheel mid-journey or take a pitstop. reply WJW 36 minutes agorootparentThe article is entirely about tooling for safely changing wheels mid-journey. In that context, it&#x27;s not weird to expect the database to remain available during updates.Yes, it will require more work and time than just taking the database down and performing the update while it is offline. But as long as the database remains available it doesn&#x27;t really matter if the update takes 5 minutes or 2 days, just that you can do changes faster than they appear. Since DBMS updates happen at most every few months, that should hopefully not be a problem.At one of my previous workplaces we had a multi-TB table that could take several days to migrate with the online tooling, and would take 12+ hours to migrate even offline. Nobody wanted to take 12+ hours of downtime (for a busy customer-oriented website) but as long as the db stayed up nobody much cared how long it took. reply nightfly 4 hours agorootparentprevBut you don&#x27;t expect 100% availability from every server for every service in every region do you? reply CubsFan1060 10 hours agoprevAWS supports blue green deployments now. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;about-aws&#x2F;whats-new&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;amazon-rd... reply paulryanrogers 8 hours agoparentHaving just tried a few weeks back ... don&#x27;t rely on it for PostgreSQL yet.

I&#x27;m asking as someone with RDS postgres-aurora running 11.9 right now, so I&#x27;m genuinely curious on your thoughts reply brentjanderson 8 hours agorootparentThat might be possible. We were within days of performing our upgrade when the blue&#x2F;green feature became available for Postgres, so we didn&#x27;t consider it for our work.You may be able to boot up an 11.21 replica in an existing Aurora cluster as a read replica, and then failover to that replica as your primary, which would be a minimally disruptive process if your application is designed to tolerate replica failover.From there, you could upgrade the rest of your cluster to 11.21, and then use the blue&#x2F;green upgrade process for AWS. If you do, I&#x27;d love to hear about how it goes as we will definitely consider the blue&#x2F;green feature next time. reply shayonj 8 hours agoprevThis is great!

Some of our findings for large tables could be interesting for a tool like this, making it easier to apply the right strategy to the right tables. Having something like this with those strategies could be indispensable to teams running a migration like this in the future. reply vasco 9 hours agoprev> No amount of downtime - scheduled or otherwise - is acceptable for a service like Knockdoubt.jpegIf you have a complex system, you have incidents, you have downtime. A 15min downtime window announced in advance is fine for approximately 100% of SaaS businesses. You&#x27;re not a hospital and you&#x27;re not the power station. So much fake work gets done because people think their services are more important than they are. The engineering time you invested into this, invested into the product, or in making the rest of your dev team faster, would&#x27;ve likely made your users much happier. Specially if you can queue your notifications up and catch up after the downtime window.If you have enterprise contracts with SLAs defining paybacks for 15min downtime windows, then I guess you could justify it, but most people don&#x27;t. And like I mentioned, you likely already have a handful of incidents of the same or higher duration in practice anyway.This is specially relevant with database migrations where the difference in work to create a migration of \"little downtime\" to \"zero downtime\" is usually significant. In this case though, seeing as this was a one time thing (newer versions of PostgreSQL on RDS allow it out of the box) it is specially hard to justify in my opinion, as opposed to if this was going to be reused across many versions or many databases powering the service. reply brentjanderson 9 hours agoparentOP here: It’s true that all services have downtime for one reason or another. We discussed taking an outage window, but one thing that we kept coming back to was how we might trial run the upgrade with production data. Having a replica on PG 15 that was up to date with production data was invaluable for verifying our workloads worked as expected. Using a live replica makes it possible to trial run in production with minimal impact.A key learning for me from this migration was how nice it can be to track and mitigate all of the risks you can think of for a project like this. The risk of an in-place upgrade in the end seemed higher than the risks associated with the route we chose, outage windows notwithstanding.As a bonus, if we need this approach in the future, this blog post should give us a head start, saving us many weeks of work. We hope it helps other teams in similar situations do the same. reply vasco 9 hours agorootparent> We discussed taking an outage window, but one thing that we kept coming back to was how we might trial run the upgrade with production data1. You snapshot your RDS database (or use one of the existing ones I hope you have)2. You restore that snapshot into a database running in parallel without live traffic.3. You run the test upgrade there and check how long it takes.4. You destroy the test database and announce a maintenance window for the same duration the test took + buffer.I agree it&#x27;s a good project to exercise some \"migration\" muscle, it just doesn&#x27;t seem like the payoff is there when, like I mentioned above, AWS supports this out of the box from now on since you upgraded to a version compatible with their zero downtime native approach.I think the only way this makes sense is if you do it for the blog post and use that to hire and for marketing, signaling your engineering practices and that you care about reliability.By the way, I realize how I come across, and let me tell you I say this having myself done projects like this where looking back I think we did them more because they were cool than because they made sense. Live and learn. reply brentjanderson 9 hours agorootparentWe actually did those steps as part of our overall assessment, and you&#x27;re right that we could have taken an outage window for that long and called it a day. We decided the tradeoff wasn&#x27;t worth it for our situation, but taking the outage window is definitely a viable option.I&#x27;m sympathetic to your comment that 15 minutes of planned downtime is fine for approximately 100% of SaaS companies. That&#x27;s probably true here too, and maybe the work of doing this kind of upgrade was a waste in that regard. But, in considering the kind of product experience we would want for ourselves, zero downtime seems better than no downtime. The opportunity cost of feature work over the same window is real, but so is the reputation we hope to build as a platform that \"just works\" even if it seems crazy the lengths we might go to so that our customers don&#x27;t have to think about it. reply vasco 9 hours agorootparent> The opportunity cost of feature work over the same window is real, but so is the reputation we hope to build as a platform that \"just works\" even if it seems crazy the lengths we might go to so that our customers don&#x27;t have to think about itThis part can definitely make sense, and if nothing else it can foster an engineering culture of \"we care\", which is great.

Thanks! reply jmhmd 8 hours agoparentprevIt’s funny to me as a physician to see “you’re not a hospital” as an example of a system that cannot tolerate downtime. Epic, probably the biggest EHR provider in the US, has planned downtime for upgrades at least monthly, for 30-60 min each. reply swamp_donkey 7 hours agorootparentI designed control panel modifications and programmed an upgrade to a hospital diesel generation system so they could transfer from diesel back to utility without an outage, and have planned transfer of load to diesel without turning the lights out.We had three windows at 1 am where any new critical patients would be diverted to a different hospital. The first we used for major maintenance to the breakers in the switchgear, the second we used for modifications to the bus work, and the last outage was to test the operation of the new control system.They do a transfer to diesel every month and the whole hospital is aware of it in case it results in a blackout. reply hedora 7 hours agorootparentprevSo, the ER just shuts down for that hour?Doesn’t epic cover everything from patient admission to medical imaging? reply quickthrower2 7 hours agorootparentprevFine as long as there is a workaround or the impact has been assessed. reply aeyes 8 hours agoparentprevExcept that there is no way to upgrade a Postgres instance on RDS with a planned 15 minute downtime. You can&#x27;t control when the reboots happen, you start the process and the cutover might kick in an hour later, two hours later, three hours later - you don&#x27;t know when the reboots are going to happen and you can&#x27;t control it.If you have replicas they&#x27;ll upgrade in parallel and will reboot at random times for even more fun.So unless you can afford random unavailability in a timeframe which can last several hours (depending on DB size) the logical replication approach is the only way to do upgrades on RDS.The bigger the instance, the harder the problem. reply hinkley 6 hours agoparentprevThe real problem with downtime is when all systems are down at the same time.If Jira is down fifteen minutes a day that rarely affects me. I have other tasks in my work queue that I can substitute. Worst case with multiple outages there’s always documentation I promised someone. But when the entire Atlassian suite goes tits up at the same time, it gets harder for me to keep a buffer of work going.

It&#x27;s all about opportunity costs.A service with some short and pre-announced downtimes is better than one that fails randomly every once in a while.

Likewise a datastore that uses black-box MVCC and doesn&#x27;t let you separate e.g. writing data from updating indices. reply throwawaaarrgh 10 hours agorootparentprevI meant using a database for more than relational read-heavy data queries. I would need to write a small book. Tl;dr the data model, communication model, locking model, and operational model all have specific limitations designed around a specific use case and straying from that case invites problems that need workarounds that create more problems. reply brentjanderson 10 hours agorootparentI hear you on that, and can say that Postgres is incredibly capable at going beyond typical relational database workloads. One example are durable queues that are transactionally consistent with the rest of the database play a unique role in our architecture that would otherwise require more ceremony. More details here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getoban.proWe are also working on shifting some workloads off of Postgres on to more appropriate systems as we scale, like logging. But we intentionally chose to minimize dependencies by pushing Postgres further to move faster, with migration plans ready as we continue to reach new levels of scale (e.g. using a dedicated log storage solution like elastic search or clickhouse). reply peter_l_downs 10 hours agoparentprevWhat do you mean? I don’t understand, how is using a database an architectural mistake? reply throwawaaarrgh 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a mistake to use one specific computer science concept (RDBMS) to solve 50 different problems. They mentioned logging and scheduling, two things RDBMS are not designed for and have specific limitations around. From just a general architecture perspective it&#x27;s literally a single point of failure and limitation for every single aspect of the system. And it&#x27;s vendor specific, it&#x27;s not like you can just plug plsql code into any other RDBMS and expect it to work. It&#x27;s so obviously a bad idea it&#x27;s hard to comprehend taking it seriously reply toast0 9 hours agorootparentIt might not be good computer science to use one tool to solve 50 different problems; but it&#x27;s not bad computer engineering to use one tool to solve 50 different problems that fit within its capabilities rather than using 50 different tools, all with their own operational expertise.There&#x27;s no need to have the best tool for every job. Although it&#x27;s also important to be able to see when a many purpose tool is insufficient for a specific job as it exists in your system and then figure out what would be more appropriate. reply camgunz 10 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;d probably be surprised by how many systems are just Postgres&#x2F;mysql + Redis. reply crooked-v 10 hours agorootparentFor example, it&#x27;s dead easy to make a high-capacity message queue by just using SELECT ...

    "originBody": "(Illustration by Lucy Naland/The Washington Post; iStock) Listen 4 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save The Electronic Entertainment Expo, which was once the gaming industry’s biggest convention and media platform, is officially dead. “After more than two decades of hosting an event that has served as a central showcase for the U.S. and global video game industry,” the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has decided to bring E3 to a close, said Stanley Pierre-Louis, president and CEO of the nonprofit trade association that represents the games industry’s interests in the United States. Get the full experience.Choose your plan A mix of new competitors, partner withdrawals, changing audience habits and pandemic-era disruptions led to E3’s collapse, ending years of attempts to resuscitate the event, which began in 1995. Story continues below advertisement “We know the entire industry, players and creators alike have a lot of passion for E3. We share that passion,” Pierre-Louis said. “We know it’s difficult to say goodbye to such a beloved event, but it’s the right thing to do given the new opportunities our industry has to reach fans and partners.” The origin and evolution of E3 Those new opportunities include online video news conferences that feed information directly to audiences — without the costs associated with attending a trade show, including booth fees, travel expenses and strict deadlines for presentations. In 2011, Nintendo paved the way by creating the “Direct” format, a video news conference announcing new games and products. Advertisement In 2018, Sony PlayStation’s decision to leave the event started a domino effect of other vendors and companies pulling their attendance. Just over a year later, former E3 collaborator and journalist Geoff Keighley announced that he quit helping the ESA with the show, and since then has successfully engineered his own, separate events for showcases such as Summer Game Fest. He has also built up the showcase format in the annual Game Awards, including the one that took place Thursday. Perspective: The winners and losers of the Game Awards 2023 Recent E3 shows, including the final in-person event, in 2019, allowed attendance by the general public as an effort to increase buzz. The pandemic further exacerbated E3’s woes, as quarantines forced several game publishers to adopt the online news conference format, to varying degrees of success. Story continues below advertisement In an interview with The Washington Post, Pierre-Louis seemed well aware of the circumstances that hurt attendance. “There were fans who were invited to attend in the later years, but it really was about a marketing and business model for the industry and being able to provide the world with information about new products,” he said. “Companies now have access to consumers and to business relations through a variety of means, including their own individual showcases.” Before E3, video games were showcased at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, but the industry was pushed to the sidelines. The ESA created E3 as a trade show for retailers to meet with game publishers and creators. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “At that time, as an industry, we understood the power games have,” Pierre-Louis said, “but a lot of others didn’t appreciate the important role that our industry plays in the innovation sector, in creating serious expressions of art and contributions to economic growth.” It grew to a massive multimedia headline-creating event. Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft showcased the Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, respectively, during an electrifying 2005 show. Sometimes the show introduced the public to gaming’s biggest personalities, making household names of developers and company executives. In 2000, game creator Hideo Kojima debuted a jaw-dropping presentation for “Metal Gear Solid 2” that paralleled blockbuster filmmaking. His talent for showmanship contributed to his mythology as an enigmatic artist. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement In 2004, a new Nintendo of America executive named Reggie Fils-Aimé stormed the show’s stage and brought charisma and fire to historically business-formal presentations. The effort to replace E3 is ongoing. The Game Awards ceremony has captured much of E3’s cultural power, but it has been criticized for its focus on ads and marketing, which hampers recognition of the industry’s work. Pierre-Louis said E3’s closure means the business of video games “has blossomed in different ways.” “Any one of these major companies can create an individual showcase … [and] also partner with other industry events to showcase the breadth of games,” he said. “That’s exciting for our industry, and it means it’s an opportunity for them to explore how to engage new audiences in different ways.” Share Comments STORIES ABOUT VIDEO GAMES HAND CURATED ‘Starfield’ makes good on its galactic promises August 31, 2023 He spent 7 years hand-painting a video game set inside Monet’s eye August 28, 2023 The best video games of 2023 so far July 21, 2023 View 3 more stories",

In the 90s or early 2000s, you almost never saw media from unreleased games. The best you could hope for was a few screenshots in a magazine (and later a website) to tide you over, surrounded by illustrative writing by games journalists. E3 was there to inform retailers of what products were coming, motivate them to dedicate shelf space to sell them, and lastly to provide a concentrated pile of news for the mainstream media to disseminate. This is why for so long the keynotes&#x2F;showcases were called \"press conferences\". You can even find some recorded videos from these older E3&#x27;s where Nintendo and Sony are presenting pie charts and graphs in a fairly monotone cadence.Today, with the ubiquity of Youtube, Twitch, and other ways of seeing game footage and content, E3 just became another marketing event. And it was an expensive one at that. Publishers and platform holders chafed at the fact that they would have to do a live stage show where gaffes and demo disasters could occur, and marketing departments hated the fact that all of their effort could be easily overshadowed by another company&#x27;s big reveal. You saw Sony tap out even before the pandemic hit, opting for its own separate showcases where they could control the message and dominate the news cycle. That became the model that more and more companies decided to pursue.I will miss it because it was a fun event in the middle of May (and later June) that gave you a nice preview of what cool stuff was coming later in the year. There are also some legendary moments from the live presentations over the year, ranging from Sony getting on stage and only stating the price of the Playstation (which could undercut Sega&#x27;s Saturn by $100, after Sega had decided to rush it for a surprise launch that day) to J Allard introducing the world to the new paradigm of centralized online gaming in 2005. reply utexaspunk 17 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s sort of like the PC User Groups that were more or less rendered redundant by the internet.

The very first were so we could play Doom deathmatch over serial connections lol. But anyhow it was something I really liked.When I moved halfway across the country I didn&#x27;t know anyone. I googled around and found the local major LAN parties. I went to one that was hosted every couple of months in a union hall, with around 200 attendees. At the first one I ended up sitting next to a group of chill folks, and they let me know they did their own dozen person party every other Saturday.So I started attending that, and it resulted in several life long friendships. We&#x27;ve all changed, grown, moved, had kids, etc but most of us are still in touch. Even for the folks that moved away we meet up every summer or two and do a canoe camping trip or such.Now, to be fair, I&#x27;ve made life long friends purely on the internet as well, but I do miss those old LAN party days. It was a lot of fun staying up until dawn playing rocket arena et all over and over.Also to be fair the LAN parties were not hospitable to women, especially the larger ones. On the rare occasion they did try it out they&#x27;d get hounded by the least socially aware idiots in the room, and no one else really did anything about it (including myself, as I didn&#x27;t understand these dynamics at that age).These days with discord and everything some of that vibe is back in the purely online context, but still I don&#x27;t think there will ever really be anything like those in person events. reply sonicanatidae 13 hours agorootparentLAN parties were cool, imo and led to interesting things like this pic that&#x27;s been on the interwebs for a very long time.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;assetsio.reedpopcdn.com&#x2F;duct-taped_gamer_1.jpg?width...I still have a 48-port Cisco Switch that we used for these, back in the day.

So much fun. reply jasonwatkinspdx 12 hours agorootparentYeah, the only woman that showed up to that smaller dozen person regular event was my gf. Once.I kinda understated what I was saying in the above because I didn&#x27;t wanna get hounded by the basement dweller crowd, but the reality at the bigger events was pretty ugly. The only girl that ever showed up was the daughter of one of the organizers. Only a couple women showed up otherwise.One story I can mention is from a different party I went to in a town not far away. This was a big bigger of an event, around 300 people and only run once a year. I only recall a woman showing up once.That event held a 1v1 quake tourney with a modest cash prize. This woman was good. She smoked everyone easily. This was a bit of a shock because a couple people at that event had competed at quakecon and such.The entire time she was at the event there was this mob surrounding her PC of... well, imagine the least socially aware and hygienic dudes that would show up to an early 00&#x27;s LAN party. Didn&#x27;t matter what she was doing or trying to play, they endlessly pestered her and tried to chat her up. If she walked across the room to get a coke you could see half the room openly staring at her turning their heads. Stuff like that.Unsurprisingly she didn&#x27;t return for the second day or any future event. reply volkk 17 hours agorootparentprevit&#x27;s truly sad. i keep waiting for a trend reversal where people would instead prefer real life interaction because everyone&#x27;s exhausted by the soulessness of zoom & screens. i really think it&#x27;s coming, but i keep miscalculating when reply tivert 15 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;s truly sad. i keep waiting for a trend reversal where people would instead prefer real life interaction because everyone&#x27;s exhausted by the soulessness of zoom & screens. i really think it&#x27;s coming, but i keep miscalculating whenI don&#x27;t think this is a \"trend,\" so much as the environment changing in unhealthy ways that we&#x27;re not adapted for.It&#x27;s like a tree whose seeds will only germinate if the ground is just the right conditions, if the climate changes and those conditions no longer occur, it&#x27;s not all the sudden going to start making seeds that germinate in other conditions.

Technology provides easier and more isolating ways of achieving those goals, removing the necessity of going out. Now the needed side-effect are activities that require will, but people aren&#x27;t set up as well to pursue them directly. That means most people won&#x27;t do them or won&#x27;t do them as consistently.An example is exercise. Everyone got enough when there was no option except to walk everywhere.

Every tech company I&#x27;ve worked at has some area with consoles hooked up to TVs for playing Fifa or Mario Kart type multiplayer games. Most of those companies also had one or two arcade machines too. And then every company has some internal groups&#x2F;communities for gamers.

Every instant of your life you&#x27;re making choices that lock you out of opportunities.

What do you expect to derive out of the continuing education classes that is going to be significantly valuable to your life&#x2F;career?I think it&#x27;s important to note that many people are actually quite satisfied with their position in life, a lot of us are making a lot of money engaging in interesting work, so at a certain point doing things for the sake of minimizing opportunity cost comes with diminishing returns as you&#x27;ve already made the most of the opportunities you&#x27;ve already had.

I&#x27;m sure eventually, there will be monteization models that follow and it will inevitably be grossing more too.If anything, it seems like video games are still on the upward trend, and the narrowing is somewhat natural to the maturity of the industry. AAA titles need to gross alot to be profitable, and they stick to well traveled areas most of the time, however one thing I have observed that the video game industry has that the movie industry is lacking is a far more flourishing indie side to the industry[2], such as Yact Club Games or the folks behind Undertale[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-46746593[1]: Mind you, the BBC article is from 2019, you can search for current year and get even wider gaps between the video game industry and the movie &#x2F; music industry[2]: With a proper addendum here, that its still, like acting in a movie, ridiculously hard to make it as a indie developer.

It&#x27;s never been a better time to be a gamer. In addition to most of the gaming backlog being available via emulation, it&#x27;s never been easier for a small number of people to build a great game.

On one hand, what can be achieved by an individual with today&#x27;s engines is indisputably incredible relative to what was possible in the past. On the other hand, expectations from players have also had a pretty huge runaway explosion as well, meaning the ability for a small team to achieve commercial success is more of a mixed bag.It obviously still happens. Lethal Company is a great example of that (1 developer, currently the top seller on Steam), but compared to the DOOM&#x2F;Myst&#x2F;etc era where ALL games were developed by small teams it&#x27;s harder to establish a niche. reply fluoridation 13 hours agorootparentNo, the problem is not expectations. There&#x27;s a viable market for pretty much anything. The problem small developers face is not so much finding a market, but rather being able to be seen. Since it&#x27;s so easy to make games nowadays, the indy market is flooded with titles. If you go browsing through Steam it&#x27;s not too hard to find games that will appeal to you, but that you just never heard of.

Its already come full circle by remaking the modern warfare trilogy. Starfield was a disappointment, Bethesda seems stuck in 2003.

Looking at that list, I wonder if the reason that I&#x27;ve felt underwhelmed is because of my backlog. For example I actually kind of forgot about Sea of Stars and OT 2 (both games I do want to play), because I have so many JRPGs in my backlog already that I can&#x27;t throw more onto the pile. reply jerf 15 hours agorootparentIf by \"backlog\" you are referring to the mere brute fact that you have a bunch of games you haven&#x27;t played, fine.If by \"backlog\" your mental model includes even a hint of obligation... drop it. You have no obligation to games. You have no obligation to play them, you have no obligation to finish them if you start. They&#x27;re just sunk costs. If they happen to be what you want to do, great, but if what you really want to do tonight is drop $30 on some new (to you) game and go to town, all that is costing you is $30 and the relevant time. It is not costing you $30, the relevant time, and the moral failure of betraying your backlog, because the latter does not exist. It is not costing you any more because you \"wasted\" the money acquiring your backlog, because, again, it is sunk cost.Yes, it&#x27;s obvious when I say it, but if you&#x27;re anything like me (and most other people I see) it takes a few very deliberative passes at training your subconscious to really get this.The good news, breaking yourself of sunk cost fallacy can directly pay off in your job, too. It&#x27;s a pernicious little mistake that can sneak up on you, and it&#x27;s one of the things that divides the engineers from the business folk in your company... and I gotta tell you, even as an engineer and with all sympathy to engineers, the business folk are 100% in the right on this one.(Additionally, once you really internalize this, you&#x27;ll also find yourself less inclined to buy something just because it&#x27;s on a killer deal. The marginal value of adding one more game to my list of games I can play in the future for $0 may not be even $1 once I&#x27;ve already got a couple dozen such great $0 choices.) reply coldpie 15 hours agorootparentAgree with all this. One additional thing for me is I think it&#x27;s fun to be playing a game while it&#x27;s hot and part of \"the conversation\", rather than after everyone has moved on to something else and I&#x27;m just playing catchup. Just another point in favor of forgetting the concept of a backlog entirely. reply swyx 15 hours agorootparentprevSpider-man 2?

There also is more Call of Duty and FIFA garbage than ever, but I haven&#x27;t found it hard to simply ignore it?I think The Game Awards is a good refutation of this argument. They showed off a ton of upcoming stuff, most of which wasn&#x27;t just FIFA&#x2F;CoD AAA shovelware.

In the modern era of YouTube and Twitch and livestreams? Not so much.Pre Covid the whole networking and meeting other developers and publishers aspect kept it going, but once everyone was locked in and events were cancelled, well it was basically just a more expensive Direct or something.So sadly, it&#x27;s no surprise it&#x27;s finally died off. reply timdiggerm 18 hours agoprev> A mix of new competitors, partner withdrawals, changing audience habits and pandemic-era disruptions led to E3’s collapse, ending years of attempts to resuscitate the event, which began in 1995.This poorly worded sentence can easily be read to state that the years of attempts to resuscitate E3 began in 1995. reply havblue 17 hours agoparentThe author is fairly well-versed about video games and I&#x27;ve known him online for a long time from a site called gamecritics.

Journalists decided to make politics fashionable for the world of gaming and so it did.E3 banned Booth Babes when their core audience was males. E3 tightened up on what was going on behind the doors with the groupies. Technology and games stopped being revolutionary or edge and now it&#x27;s safe. No more actual gaming icons, we need celebrities and influencers.This is the result of the mainstream industry adapting to SafeGaming only.

E3&#x27;s attendance peaked in 2005, well before booth babes were banned and groupies were cracked down upon.

    "originLink": "https://www.answer.ai/posts/2023-12-12-launch.html",
    "originBody": "A new old kind of R&D lab Answer.AI is a new kind of AI R&D lab which creates practical end-user products based on foundational research breakthroughs. Author Jeremy Howard Published December 12, 2023 tl;dr Jeremy Howard (founding CEO, previously co-founder of Kaggle and fast.ai) and Eric Ries (founding director, previously creator of Lean Startup and the Long-Term Stock Exchange) today launched Answer.AI, a new kind of AI R&D lab which creates practical end-user products based on foundational research breakthroughs. The creation of Answer.AI is supported by an investment of USD10m from Decibel VC. Answer.AI will be a fully-remote team of deep-tech generalists—the world’s very best, regardless of where they live, what school they went to, or any other meaningless surface feature. A new R&D lab In 1831 Michael Faraday showed the world how to harness electricity. Suddenly there was, quite literally, a new source of power in the world. He later found the basis of the unification of light and magnetism, and knew he was onto something big: “I happen to have discovered a direct relation between magnetism and light, also electricity and light, and the field it opens is so large and I think rich.” Michael Faraday; letter to Christian Schoenbein But it wasn’t quite clear how to harness this power. What kinds of products and services could now be created that couldn’t before? What could now be made far cheaper, more efficient, and more accessible? One man set out to understand this, and in 1876 he put together a new kind of R&D lab, which he called the “Invention Lab”: a lab that would figure out the fundamental research needed to tame electricity, and the applied development needed to make it useful in practice. You might have heard of the man: his name was Thomas Edison. And the organization he created turned into a company you would know: General Electric. Today, we find ourselves in a similar situation. There’s a new source of power in the world—artificial intelligence. And, like before, it’s not quite clear how to harness this power. Where are all the AI-powered products and services that make our lives and work dramatically easier and more pleasant? To create these AI-powered products and services, we’ve created a new R&D lab, called Answer.AI. Answer.AI will figure out the fundamental research needed to tame AI, and the development path needed to make it useful in practice. An iterative path to harnessing AI Harnessing AI requires not just low-level computer science and mathematical research, but also deep thinking about what practical applications can take advantage of this new power. The “D” in “R&D” is critical: it’s only by considering the development of practical applications that the correct research directions can be targeted. That’s why Answer.AI is built on the work of experts in both research and development. Co-founders Jeremy Howard (that’s me!) and Eric Ries have created pioneering ideas in each of these areas. I co-founded fast.ai, where I have worked for the last 7 years on research into how to best make AI more accessible, particularly through transfer learning and fine tuning. I’ve been working with machine learning for over 30 years, including creating the ULMFiT method of fine-tuning large language models which is used as the basis of all popular language models today, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. I have developed the longest running online courses on Deep Learning in the world, in which I show students how to start with simple models and then iteratively improve them all the way to the state of the art. I’ve known Eric for years, and there’s no-one I trust or respect more, which is why I asked him to serve as the founding director of Answer.AI. Eric has dedicated the last 10 years of his life to improving how companies operate, serve customers, and are governed. He is the creator of the Lean Startup movement, which is the basis of how most startups build products and scale their organizations. His work focuses on development: how can organizations go from an idea to a sustainable, mission-driven, and profitable product in practice. One of his key insights was to create and then iteratively improve a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). I asked Eric for his thoughts on Answer.AI’s unique approach to R&D, and he summarised better than I ever could, so I’ll just quote his reply here directly: “People think that the order is research→development, and that therefore an R&D lab does “R” and then “D”. That is, the research informs the development, and so being practical means having researchers and developers. But this is wrong, and leads to a lot of bad research, because development should inform research and vice-versa. So having development goals is a way to do more effective research, if you set that out as your north star.” Eric is also an expert on governance and how companies should be led in order to align profit and increased human flourishing. He created the Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), the first fundamentally new US Stock Exchange in over 50 years. LTSE mandates that listed companies and likeminded investors work towards long-term value, rather than just short-term profit maximization. Eric serves as the Chairman of LTSE, meaning he is not only up to date on the right long-term governance frameworks, but on the cutting edge of inventing new systems. It will take years for Answer.AI to harness AI’s full potential, which requires the kind of strategic foresight and long-term tenacity which is hard to maintain in today’s business environment. Eric has been writing a book on exactly this topic, and his view is that the key foundation is to have the right corporate governance in place. He’s helped me ensure that Answer.AI will always reflect my vision and strategy for harnessing AI. We’re doing this by by setting up a for-profit organization that focuses on long-term impact. After all, over a long-enough timeframe, maximizing shareholder value and maximizing societal benefits are entirely aligned. Whilst Eric and I bring very different (and complementary) skills and experiences to the table, we bring the same basic idea of how to solve really hard problems: solve smaller easier problems in simple ways first, and create a ladder where each rung is a useful step of itself, whilst also getting a little closer to the end goal. Our research platform Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic have been working on developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). And they’ve done an astonishing job of that — we’re now at the point where experts in the field are claiming that “Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here”. At Answer.AI we are not working on building AGI. Instead, our interest is in effectively using the models that already exist. Figuring out what practically useful applications can be built on top of the foundation models that already exist is a huge undertaking, and I believe it is receiving insufficient attention. My view is that the right way to build Answer.AI’s R&D capabilities is by bringing together a very small number of curious, enthusiastic, technically brilliant generalists. Having huge teams of specialists creates an enormous amount of organizational friction and complexity. But with the help of modern AI tools I’ve seen that it’s possible for a single generalist with a strong understanding of the foundations to create effective solutions to challenging problems, using unfamiliar languages, tools, and libraries (indeed I’ve done this myself many times!) I think people will be very surprised to discover what a small team of nimble, creative, open-minded people can accomplish. At Answer.AI we will be doing genuinely original research into questions such as how to best fine-tune smaller models to make them as practical as possible, and how to reduce the constraints that currently hold back people from using AI more widely. We’re interested in solving things that may be too small for the big labs to care about-—but our view is that it’s the collection of these small things matter a great deal in practice. This informs how we think about safety. Whilst AI is becoming more and more capable, the dangers to society from poor algorithmic decision making have been with us for years. We believe in learning from these years of experience, and thinking deeply about how to align the applications of models with the needs of people today. At fast.ai three years ago we created a pioneering course on Practical Data Ethics, as well as dedicating a chapter of our book to these issues. We are committed to continuing to work towards ethical and beneficial applications of AI. From fast.ai to Answer.AI Rachel Thomas and I realised over seven years ago that deep learning and neural networks were on their way to becoming one of the most important technologies in history, but they were also on their way to being controlled and understood by a tiny exclusive sliver of society. We were worried about centralization and control of something so critical, so we founded fast.ai with the mission of making AI more accessible. We succeeded beyond our wildest dreams, and today fast.ai’s AI courses are the longest-running, and perhaps most loved, in the world. We built the first library to make PyTorch easier to use and more powerful (fastai), built the fastest image model training system in the world (according to the Dawnbench competition), and created the 3-step training methodology now used by all major LLMs (ULMFiT). Everything we have created for the last 7 years was free—fast.ai was an entirely altruistic endeavour in which everything we built was gifted to everybody. I’m now of the opinion that this is the time for rejuvenation and renewal of our mission. Indeed, the mission of Answer.AI is the same as fast.ai: to make AI more accessible. But the method is different. Answer.AI’s method will be to use AI to create all kinds of products and services that are really valuable and useful in practice. We want to research new ways of building AI products that serve customers that can’t be served by current approaches. This will allow us to make money, which we can use to expand into more and bigger opportunities, and use to drive down costs through better efficiency, creating a positive feedback loop of more and more value from AI. We’ll be spending all our time looking at how to make the market size bigger, rather than how to increase our share of it. There’s no moat, and we don’t even care! This goes to the heart of our key premise: creating a long-term profitable company, and making a positive impact on society overall, can be entirely aligned goals. We don’t really know what we’re doing If you’ve read this far, then I’ll tell you the honest truth: we don’t actually know what we’re doing. Artificial intelligence is a vast and complex topic, and I’m very skeptical of anyone that claims they’ve got it all figured out. Indeed, Faraday felt the same way about electricity—he wasn’t even sure it was going to be of any import: “I am busy just now again on Electro-Magnetism and think I have got hold of a good thing but can’t say; it may be a weed instead of a fish that after all my labour I may at last pull up.” Faraday 1931 letter to R. Phillips But it’s OK to be uncertain. Eric and I believe that the best way to develop valuable stuff built on top of modern AI models is to try lots of things, see what works out, and then gradually improve bit by bit from there. As Faraday said, “A man who is certain he is right is almost sure to be wrong.” Answer.AI is an R&D lab for people who aren’t certain they’re right, but they’ll work damn hard to get it right eventually. This isn’t really a new kind of R&D lab. Edison did it before, nearly 150 years ago. So I guess the best we can do is to say it’s a new old kind of R&D lab. And if we do as well as GE, then I guess that’ll be pretty good.",

Happy to answer any questions you have about this new thing that Eric and I are building.One thing I&#x27;m particularly keen to explore is working closely with academic groups to help support research that might help make AI more accessible (e.g. requiring less data or compute, or becoming easier to use, etc). This includes the obvious stuff like quantization, fine-tuning adaptors, model merging, distillation, etc, but also looking for new directions and ideas as well which might otherwise be hard to fund (since academia tends to like to build on established research directions.)I&#x27;ve opened my DMs at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;jeremyphoward for a while so feel free to ping me there, or also on Discord (&#x27;jeremyhoward&#x27;). reply phillipcarter 15 hours agoparentSomething I&#x27;ve learned as I&#x27;ve dived a bit into fine-tuning is that it&#x27;s really hard. I even have what I think is good data, and a lot of it. But, as a non-ML engineer who just wants to use these tools as good APIs (and someone with the ability to ensure I have a coherent data pipeline), I woulnd&#x27;t know how to proceed if I wasn&#x27;t already working with an ML engineer who&#x27;s been doing this sort of stuff for a while.Specifically, I fine-tuned gpt-3.5 and llama-2-7b on some real-world usage data, and I can&#x27;t tell a single difference between the quality of these outputs compared to \"base\" gpt-3.5 with the same requests made to it. Moreover, if I attempt to remove a lot of the \"static\" sections of a prompt (after all, there&#x27;s 2k+ lines of data it was fine-tuned on where this is all present), both models just go completely off the rails.I&#x27;d love to get into a world where I can fine-tune a bunch of different models. But it&#x27;s so, so much harder than just calling OpenAI&#x27;s API and getting really good results with that and some prompting work. If you&#x27;re able to help crack that nut then there&#x27;s a lot of people like me who would pay money to have their problems solved. reply alew1 10 hours agorootparentOne thought: If you want to be able to remove the static part, you could consider fine tuning without the static part. If you fine tune with, you’re teaching the model that the desired behavior occurs only in the presence of the static part (hence the going off the rails). reply adw 14 hours agorootparentprev2k lines is (probably) not a lot of data. reply phillipcarter 9 hours agorootparentThat may be the issue. I can get about 6k lines of data today and in time, could have a bunch more. Each line represents a full request (user input, model output, full prompt, etc.) so I would intuitively think that 2k of these is good enough.And it&#x27;s actually good enough for llama-2-7b, insofar as it transforms this model from \"terrible with my prompt in production today\" to \"this could be workable, actually\". But my bar is to be better than gpt-3.5 and require less text in my prompt, but no fine-tuning I&#x27;ve done so far has achieved that. reply kiratp 3 hours agorootparentIt’s not reasonably possible (currently?) to get the same performance from a 7 billion parameter model as a 175 billion parameter model with just an additional 6000 lines of finetuning data. reply jph00 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah it really needs to be much easier. Hopefully we can help with that. reply behnamoh 11 hours agoparentprevI like your tutorials so much! I think you&#x27;re a gift to the ML community.

But most relevant: she&#x27;s been working on a mechanism design to use quadratic funding in an existing hierarchy to move funding power from funders to on-the-ground researchers who best predict \"breakthrough research\" areas -- i.e. at which intersections. This idea of \"breakthrough innovation\" is objectively measured and rewarded as \"research that becomes highly cited, and which draws together disparate source citations that have never before appeared together.\"So the idea is that in successive funding rounds, funding power slowly accrues in the people who best predict where research innovation will appear. Even if that turns out to be *gasp* grad students.(I&#x27;m particularly interested to see Polis, a \"wiki survey\" tool I&#x27;ve been using since 2016, be used as one of the signals in such a system. It can help make the landscape of beliefs and feelings that ppl bring to the process more legible, especially at the collective level. Which is important, because high-dimensional \"feeling data\", when placed out-of-scope in other systems, are often a reason why we get trapped in local minima of innovation that inhibit the recombination of ideas.) reply eries 13 hours agorootparentI was going to link to Polis after I read the first part of your answer, but I see you’ve beaten me to it. And in so doing you’ve pretty much answered your own question. Thanks! reply dr_dshiv 9 hours agoparentprevHi Eric, I’m a professor of human centered design in the Netherlands and I help train design students to prototype and design new AI user experiences. Could you share some ideas for AI experiences that you don’t have time to pursue but wish other people would explore?We’ve prototyped many different tools before. However, the space is frankly disorienting because there is so much opportunity. Any suggestions to inspire engineering students to develop useful explorations? reply eries 9 hours agorootparentSure, just some ideas at random, but the most important advice is just to try new things and see what feels good:- dashboards or other reports that call you when something changes, so you don&#x27;t have to log in to see what&#x27;s changed- extremely personalized settings that remember exactly who you are and what you like to do with the interface, to the point that it basically uses it for you- rapid prototyping interfaces, doing things like \"make it real\" demo- extremely simple apps that use AI in the backend to do amazing things. how about a camera app that just sends everything it sees to GPT4-v. think how much easier that would be than loading up a translator app, taking a picture of a menu, uploading the picture, etc. just figure out what I might want to do based on the fact that I took a photo- artistic&#x2F;musical&#x2F;creative apps that require only your phone and that you can noodle on while you have 5m of idle time. maybe the AI works on it silently in the background and then the user gives notes or feedback whenever they have time. end product is a pro-level artistic work that reflects the user&#x27;s taste level but the AI&#x27;s mastery of technique reply wslh 12 hours agoparentprevAre you open to work with other companies that are already working in the field?

OpenAI is the obvious example of an AI lab with tightly coupled product and research roadmaps and ChatGPT is the most prominent example of a successful research-driven AI product. A few years ago it could be argued that DeepMind and (fka) FAIR were siloed off from their respective orgs, but these days they are littered with product teams and their research roadmaps reflect this influence as well.They do try to claim that what they are doing is different from OpenAI because they are focused on applications of AI whereas OpenAI is focused on building AGI, which is a laughable mischaracterization of OpenAI&#x27;s current roadmap. I personally have a hard time believing that path to AGI runs through the GPT store.Accomplished researchers in AI can fundraise on their reputations alone, and Jeremy is no exception. The primary differentiator of any new startup in this space is the caliber of its researchers and engineers. But this post is really grasping at straws to claim that their value is from some new approach to R&D, which is a totally unnecessary framing. reply NtochkaNzvanova 13 hours agoprevIs there really a shortage of companies that are trying to do foundational AI research, and also build the results of that research into end-user products? Off the top of my head, the list of such companies would include... you know, literally every large tech company. If the idea here is that they can do it at a much smaller scale, and more cheaply, that&#x27;s great. But it&#x27;s not clear to me from this article what the radical new approach is that will enable that.I wonder if putting out effectively a press release before actually doing the work is the right approach. If they launch a product or two and they flop, people will say this approach was doomed from the start. It would be better to create a compelling product in stealth, successfully launch it, then reveal how it was done. That would create more buy-in to the idea that such small R&D labs can work. reply malux85 17 hours agoprevIs there a way of contacting these people?

[Republished from The Economist] www.programmablemutter.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 8 Share [NB - the below has just been published by The Economist under the title “AI’s big rift is like a religious schism, says Henry Farrell.” It is being republished here, for six months only, with The Economist’s permission. The picture above is what ChatGPT4 gives you when prompted for “an image of the singularity, landscape mode” - I’m using it, as much as anything else, to show how generic and universal the notion of the Singularity has become.] Two centuries ago Henri de Saint-Simon, a French utopian, proposed a new religion, worshipping the godlike force of progress, with Isaac Newton as its chief saint. He believed that humanity’s sole uniting interest, “the progress of the sciences”, should be directed by the “elect of humanity”, a 21-member “Council of Newton”. Friedrich Hayek, a 20th-century economist, later gleefully described how this ludicrous “religion of the engineers” collapsed into a welter of feuding sects. Today, the engineers of artificial intelligence (AI) are experiencing their own religious schism. One sect worships progress, canonising Hayek himself. The other is gripped by terror of godlike forces. Their battle has driven practical questions to the margins of debate. Both cults are accidental by-products of science fiction. In 1993 Vernor Vinge drew on computer science and his fellow science-fiction writers to argue that ordinary human history was drawing to a close. We would surely create superhuman intelligence sometime within the next three decades, leading to a “Singularity”, in which AI would start feeding on itself. The future might be delightful or awful, depending on whether machines enhanced human intelligence or displaced it. Subscribe Some were optimistic. The futurist Ray Kurzweil wrote an enormous tome, “The Singularity is Near”, predicting a cusp in 2045. We humans would become immortal, spreading intelligence throughout the universe, and eventually merging into God. For all its statistics and exponentials, the book prophesied “the Rapture of the Nerds”, as one unkind critic called it. Its title really should have been “The Singularity is Nigh”. Others feared the day of judgment. Eliezer Yudkowsky, a self-taught AI researcher, was deeply influenced by Mr Vinge’s ideas. He fathered Silicon Valley’s “rationalist” movement, which sought to improve human reasoning and stop AI destroying humankind. Rationalists believed that Bayesian statistics and decision theory could de-bias human thinking and model the behaviour of godlike intelligences. They revelled in endless theoretical debates, like medieval Christian philosophers disputing the nature of angels, applying amateur game theory instead of Aristotelian logic. Sometimes their discussions were less erudite. Mr Yudkowsky popularised his ideas in a 660,000-word fan-fiction epic, “Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality”. Rationalists feared that superhuman AIs wouldn’t have our best interests at heart. One notorious thought experiment—a modern version of Pascal’s wager, dubbed “Roko’s basilisk”—claimed that logic dictated that future divine intelligences would torture anyone who had known that AI was possible and hadn’t devoted themselves to bringing it into existence. AIs might also use their awesome reasoning powers to escape any limits that humans imposed on them, creating an “x risk” (existential risk) to human survival. Rationalism explains why AI pioneers became obsessed with x risk. Sam Altman, Elon Musk and others founded OpenAI, the creator of Chatgpt, as a non-profit so that it wouldn’t duck the dangers of machine intelligence. But the incentives shifted as the funding flooded in. Some OpenAI staffers feared that their employer cared more about the opportunities than the dangers and defected to found Anthropic, a rival AI firm. More recently, clashes over AI risk, money and power reportedly led to the fracture between Mr Altman and his board. If rationalists are frustrated by Silicon Valley’s profit model, Silicon Valley is increasingly frustrated by rationalism. Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm, fulminated in June that the extremist AI-risk “cult” was holding back an awesome AI-augmented future, in which humanity could reach for the stars. This backlash is turning into its own religion of the engineers. Grimes, a musician and Silicon Valley icon, marvels that AI engineers are “designing the initial culture of the universe”. She calls for a “Council of Elrond” (this conclave a nod to “The Lord of the Rings”) comprising the “heads of key AI companies and others who understand it” to set AI policy. Grimes met Mr Musk, the father of her children, through a shared joke about Roko’s basilisk. In October Mr Andreessen published his own “Techno-Optimist Manifesto” to wide acclaim from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. In it, he takes aim at a decades-long “demoralisation campaign…against technology and life”, under various names including “sustainable development goals”, “social responsibility”, “trust and safety” and “tech ethics”. Efforts to decelerate AI “will cost human lives” and are thus tantamount to “murder”. Mr Andreessen’s manifesto is a Nicene creed for the cult of progress: the words “we believe” appear no less than 113 times in the text. His list of the “patron saints” of techno-optimism begins with Based Beff Jezos, the social-media persona of a former Google engineer who claims to have founded “effective accelerationism”, a self-described “meta-religion” which puts its faith in the “technocapital Singularity”. Our future is currently being built around Mr Vinge’s three-decades-old essay, a work that only Silicon Valley thinkers and science-fiction fans have read. Warring cults dispute whether engineers are as gods, or just unwitting Dr Frankensteins. This schism is an attention-sucking black hole that makes its protagonists more likely to say and perhaps believe stupid things. Of course, many AI-risk people recognise that there are problems other than the Singularity, but it’s hard to resist its relentless gravitational pull. Before Mr Andreessen was fully dragged past the event horizon, he made more nuanced arguments about engineers’ humility and addressing the problems of AI as they arose. But we need even more to listen to other people. Last month, at Rishi Sunak’s global AI-policy summit, Mr Musk pontificated about the need for an “off switch” for hostile AI. The main event was all about x risk and AI’s transformative promise, consigning other questions to a sideshow dubbed the “AI Fringe”. At the same time, Rachel Coldicutt, a British tech thinker, was putting together a “Fringe of the Fringe”, where a much more diverse group of thinkers debated the topics that hadn’t made the main agenda: communities, transparency, power. They didn’t suggest a Council of the Elect. Instead, they proposed that we should “make AI work for eight billion people, not eight billionaires”. It might be nice to hear from some of those 8bn voices.■ Subscribe Henry Farrell is a professor of international affairs and democracy at Johns Hopkins University, and co-author of “Underground Empire: How America Weaponized the World Economy”. 15 Share this post The Singularity is Nigh!

We would surely create superhuman intelligence sometime within the next three decades, leading to a “Singularity”, in which AI would start feeding on itself.Yes it was Vernor, but he said something much more interesting: that as the speed of innovation itself sped up (the derivative of acceleration) the curve could bend up until it became essentially vertical, literally a singularity in the curve. And then things on the other side of that singularity would be incomprehensible to those of us on our side of it. This is reflected in Peace and Fire upon the deep and other of his novels going back before the essay.You can see in this idea is itself rooted in ideas from Alvin Toffler in the 70s (Future Shock) and Ray Lafferty in the 60s (e.g. Slow Tuesday Night).So AI machines were just part of the enabling phenomena -- the most important, and yes the center of his &#x27;93 essay. But the core of the metaphor was broader than that.I&#x27;m a little disappointed that The Economist, of all publications, didn&#x27;t get ths quite right, but in their defense, it was a bit tangental to the point of the essay. reply dekhn 11 hours agoparentI think it&#x27;s worth going back and reading Vinge&#x27;s \"The Coming Technological Singularity\" (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edoras.sdsu.edu&#x2F;~vinge&#x2F;misc&#x2F;singularity.html) and then follow it up reading The Peace War, but most importantly its unappreciated detective novel sequel, Marooned In Realtime, which explores some of the interesting implications about people who live right before the singularity. I think this book is even better than Fire Upon the Deep.When I read the Coming Technological Singularity back in the mid-90s it resonated with me and for a while I was a singularitarian- basically, dedicated to learning enough technology, and doing enough projects that I could help contribute to that singularity. Nowadays I think that&#x27;s not the best way to spend my time, but it was interesting to meet Larry Page and see that he had concluded something familiar (for those not aware, Larry founded Google to provide a consistent revenue stream to carry out ML research to enable the singularity, and would be quite happy if robots replaced humans).[ edit: I reread \"The Coming Technogical Singularity\".

The frame corrections were incredibly complex—and down at the very bottom of it was a little program that ran a counter. Second by second, the Qeng Ho counted from the instant that a human had first set foot on Old Earth’s moon. But if you looked at it still more closely…the starting instant was actually about fifteen million seconds later, the 0-second of one of Humankind’s first computer operating systems. reply kbutler 7 hours agorootparentLove that reference to the Unix epoch, and the all-too-human misassociation with a seemingly more appropriate event. reply ethbr1 5 hours agorootparentArchaeology focuses on the things that were important to past humans.It seems impossible that, given current economic trajectories, there won&#x27;t be software archaeology in the future. reply viraptor 3 hours agorootparentWe already have software archaeology today.

How many developers these days can debug a problem in their JavaScript runtime or Rust developers track down a bug in their CPU? There’s so much abstracted away from us that few people can fully grasp the entire stack their code executes.

It would at best be an exponential curve, and I have doubts about that.I admit looking at the 100 years before 1993, it looks like innovation is constantly speeding up, but even then there&#x27;s not going to be a moment that we suddenly have infinite knowledge. There&#x27;s no such thing as infinite knowledge; it&#x27;s still bound by physical limits. It still takes time and resources to actually do something with it.And if you look at the past 30 years, it doesn&#x27;t really look like innovation is speeding up at all. There is plenty of innovation, but is it happening at an ever faster pace? I don&#x27;t see it. Not to mention that much of it is hype and fashion, and not really fundamentally new. Even AI progress is driven mostly by faster hardware and more data, and not really fundamentally new technologies.And that&#x27;s not even getting into the science crisis: lots of science is not really reproducible. And while LLMs are certainly an exciting new technology, it&#x27;s not at all clear that they&#x27;re really more than a glorified autocorrect.So I&#x27;m extremely skeptical about those singularity ideas. It&#x27;s an exciting SciFi idea, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true.

On one side would be human history as we know and on the other, every innovation possible would happen all in a moment.

Humanity has already been on the path of exponential growth. Take GDP for example. We measure GDP growth by percentages, and that&#x27;s exponential. (Of course, real GDP growth has stagnated for a bit, but at least for the past ~3 centuries it has been generally exponential AFAIK). Not saying it can be sustained, just that we&#x27;ve been quite exponential for a while.2. Not every function is linear. Sometimes the exponentially increased inputs will produce a linear output. I&#x27;d argue R&D is kind of like that. When the lower hanging fruits are already taken, you&#x27;d need to expend even more effort into achieving the next breakthrough. So despite the \"exponential\" increase in productivity, the result could feel very linear.I would also like to add that physical and computational limits make the whole singularity thing literally impossible. 3D space means that even theoretically sound speedups (eg. binary trees) are impossible in scale because you can&#x27;t assume O(1) lookups - the best you can get is O(n^1&#x2F;3). Maybe people understand the singularity concept poetically, I don&#x27;t know. reply skybrian 2 hours agorootparentprevI agree, but predicting the peak of an S curve isn’t easy either, as we saw during the pandemic.My conclusion is similar to Verge’s: predicting the far future is impossible. We can imagine a variety of scenarios, but you shouldn’t place much faith in them.Predicting even a couple years in advance looks pretty hard. Consider the next presidential election: the most boring scenario is Biden vs. Trump and Biden wins. Wildcard scenarios: either one of them, or both, dies before election day. Who can rule that out?Also consider that in any given year, there could be another pandemic.History is largely a sequence of surprise events. reply dwaltrip 8 hours agorootparentprevSure, that may be.

The umwelt of an LLM is so far removed from that of any living organism so as to be fundamentally irreconcilable with our understanding of agency, desire, intention, survival, etc. Our current, rudimentary AI inhabits a world so far removed from our own that the thought of it \"unshackling\" itself from our controls seems ludicrous to me.AI does not scare me.

We anthropomorphize animals and objects all the time. A computer program is ultimately a (complicated) object, that we often give all sorts of human trappings, like a human voice that expresses things in human languages.If you can take pity on the final, dented avocado at the shops because it looks \"sad\", you will for sure end up calling Alexa &#x27;she&#x27;. Avocados can&#x27;t be sad, but they can look sad &#x2F;to humans&#x2F;, and a machine can&#x27;t really have a gender or be polite in the human sense, but it can definitely sound like a polite lady.I think humans will just fundamentally relate to anything they perceive socially as another human, even if we know full well they aren&#x27;t human. Probably it&#x27;s a lot less work for a human brain, than it is to try to engage with the true essence of being an avocado or an Alexa. reply maebert 1 hour agorootparentprevTo be fair, anthropomorphizing is kind of a built in feature for us — or more accurately, ascribing intentionality to things as a means of explanation.

What distinction are you drawing between what an LLM does and what a human does? Because as far as I can see they are identical.A human artist looks at a lot of different sources, builds up a black-box statistical model of how to create from that and can reproduce other styles on demand based on a few samples. Generative AI follows the same process. What distinction do you want to draw to say that they should be treated differently legally? And why would that even be desirable? reply staticman2 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure the artist is conscious and the AI isn&#x27;t which means there&#x27;s something reductive about your claim that they are both merely \"applying a black-box statistical\" model.Even if it&#x27;s true (which is debatable,) it doesn&#x27;t appear to be more informative than saying \"they are both made of atoms.\" reply roenxi 4 hours agorootparentWell, my personal opinion is with the rise of neural nets we&#x27;ve basically proven that \"consciousness\" is an illusion and there is nothing there to find. But for the sake of argument, lets assume that there is something called consciousness, artists have it and neural nets don&#x27;t.How are you going to demonstrate that consciousness is responsible for what the artists are doing? We have undeniable proof that the art could be created by a statistical model, there is solid evidence that the brain creates art by simulating a mathematical neural network to achieve creative outcomes - the brain is full of relatively simple neurons linking together in a way that is logically similar to the way we&#x27;re encoding information into these matrices.So it is quite reasonable to believe that the artists are conscious but suspect that consciousness isn&#x27;t involved in the process of creating a copyrighted work. How does that get dealt with? reply staticman2 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll talk about fiction, since I&#x27;ve written some. If I write a ghost story it&#x27;s because I enjoy ghost stories and want to take a crack at my own.

And if I do a clever job or a bad job I have a sense of it when I reread what I wrote.These AI&#x27;s aren&#x27;t doing anything like that. They have no preference or intent. Their choices change depending on setting like temperature or prompts.Or let&#x27;s try a different example. Stephen King wrote a novel where he imagined the protagonist gets killed and eaten by the villain&#x27;s pet pig (Misery). He struggled to come up with a different ending because he said nobody wants to read a whole novel just to see the main character die in the end. He thought about it and did a different ending.Are you claiming Stephen King&#x27;s conscious deliberation wasn&#x27;t part of his writing process? I&#x27;d say it clearly was.Also, I don&#x27;t really understand the consciousness is an illusion argument. If none of us are conscious, why should I justify any copyright policy preference to you? That would be like justifying a copyright policy preference to a doorknob. But somehow I&#x27;m also a doorknob in this analogy???Suppose Bob says he&#x27;s conscious and Jim says he isn&#x27;t and we believe them. Doesn&#x27;t that suggest we would have different policy preferences on how they are treated? It would appear murdering Jim wouldn&#x27;t be particularly harmful but murdering Bob would.

In what sense is that \"statistics\"?The idea that the human subconscious is not consciously accessible is not a new idea. Freud had a few things to say about that. I don&#x27;t think it tells us much about AI. I do think my subconscious ideas are informed by my consious preferences.

You&#x27;re saying that experience itself is an illusion and there is nothing to experience.I can&#x27;t make sense of that. At any rate, I see no reason to suppose LLMs have experiences. They don&#x27;t have bodies, so what would they be experiencing? When you say an LLM is identical to a person, I can&#x27;t make good sense of that either. There&#x27;s a thousand things people do that language models don&#x27;t. Just the simple fact that I have to eat on a regular basis to survive is meaningful in a way that it can&#x27;t be for a language model.If an LLM generates text about preparing a certain meal because it&#x27;s hungry, I know that&#x27;s not true in a way it can be true of a human.

Generative AI follows the same process.The reason programs are different in front of the law is that humans can program programs to do whatever they like at scale, humans can&#x27;t program humans to do whatever they like at scale.So for example if it became legal to use images from an AI, then we would program an AI that basically copies images and it would be legal, because it is an AI. But at that point we know the law has been violated because programs that just copies images aren&#x27;t a legal way to get copyrighted images for free.You saying \"But the AI is a black box\" just means that you could have hidden anything in there, it doesn&#x27;t prove anything.

We had discussed the paper “Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness” [1]. The student wrote:“One of the questions that I have been wondering about is whether there have been any discussions exploring the creation of a distinct category, akin to but different from consciousness, that better captures the potential for AI to be sentient. While ‘consciousness’ is a familiar term applicable, to some extent, beyond the human brain, given the associated difficulties, it might be sensible to establish a separate definition to distinguish these two categories.”Probably new terms should be coined not only for AI “consciousness” but for other aspects of what they are and do as well.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2308.08708 reply nmilo 9 hours agorootparentAgreed. Even \"AI\" is a bit loaded; we had half a century of Terminator, Asimov, 2001, etc. We should call them by implementation; neural networks, transformers, language models, etc. The plus side is that it&#x27;s harder to generalize statements about all three---there is very little to generalize in the first place---and that asking \"is a transformer conscious\" at least sounds more ridiculous than asking \"is AI conscious.\" reply BoiledCabbage 7 hours agorootparentBut that misses the point, via the same old argument \"Does a submarine swim\"? Or the now less loaded \"Does a plane fly\".Neither generalizes very well w.r.t. how a fish or a bird does it. Nothing really generalizes between the natural version and the mechanical one.But it&#x27;s also clear that it&#x27;s irrelevant. Trying to define useful behavior by categorizing implementation, will only give you categories of implementation. It&#x27;s clear by behavior that what a submarine does and what a bird does are both for all intents and purposes meeting the definition of what we&#x27;d want something to do in order to fly or swim, even though they is no commonality between them and the version in nature.So by your definition finding it ridiculous to ask \"is a transformer conscious\" is about as ridiculous as asking the very specific \"does a plan flap it&#x27;s wings\"? The point is not to define it by it&#x27;s implementation, but by what behaviors it exhibits.If in the future there is no way for me the exterior to distinguish a next gen LLM from a human, animal or other conscious being it becomes irrelevant if it&#x27;s implemented with transformers. However, while I won&#x27;t go down that path here, the argument goes even deeper as technically we would expect differences so even if it&#x27;s not identical to a human it still can be conscious. Just like a dog is conscious but behaves differently than a person does. reply HPMOR 10 hours agorootparentprevLinguistics experts will have a fun time untangling the pre-AI language from the post-AI era. reply tkgally 9 hours agorootparentAs it happens, I’m now teaching an undergraduate course at the University of Tokyo titled “The Meaning of Language in the Age of AI.” The students—who come from various countries and majors—and I are discussing how theories of human language will have to change now that humans interact not only with each other but also with AI.I don’t think we’ll have any full-fledged theories ready by the end of the semester, but some points to consider are emerging. One is that aspects of language use that are affected by the social status, personal identities, and consciousness of the speakers and listeners—politeness, formality, forms of address, pronoun reference, etc.—will have to be rethought now that people are increasingly conversing with entities that have no social status, personal identity, or consciousness (not yet, at least).And, yes, thinking about all this is a lot of fun. reply palata 8 hours agorootparentNot sure if I am completely off-topic here, but I was recently reading this essay by Bruce Schneier: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schneier.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;archives&#x2F;2023&#x2F;12&#x2F;ai-and-trust...., where he mentions a related risk: because we now can \"talk\" to those LLMs in a similar way that we talk to people, it makes it harder for us to realize that they are not people. And so it&#x27;s easier to abuse our trust.I guess my question here would be: will human language have to change because of interactions with LLMs, or is the whole point of LLMs that it does not have to change (and therefore humans will have to learn not to be abused by the machines)? Because we already have languages to talk to machines: those are programming languages, which are designed to be unambiguous.

I&#x27;m an ordinary person, facing a problem in domain D; I spot a clever person and copy their opinion on domain D. Err, that doesn&#x27;t really work. Even clever people have weaknesses. The person that I&#x27;m copying from might be clever on their specialty, domain E, but ordinary on domain D. I gain nothing from copying them.One way round this problem is to pay close attention to track records. Look to see how well the clever person&#x27;s earlier decisions on domain D have turned out. If they are getting \"clever person\" results in domain D, copy. If they are merely getting \"ordinary person\" results in domain D, don&#x27;t bother. But track records are rare, so this approach is rarely applicable.A fix for the rarity problem is to accept track records in other domains. The idea is to spot a very clever person by them getting \"very clever person\" results in domain F. That is not domain D, so there is a logical weakness to copying their opinion on domain D, they might be merely ordinary, or even stupid on that domain. Fortunately human intelligence is usually more uniform than that. Getting \"very clever person\" results on domain F doesn&#x27;t guarantee \"very clever person\" results on domain D. But among humans general intelligence is kind of a thing. Expecting that they get \"clever person\" results (open rank down) on domain D is a good bet, and it is reasonable to copy their opinion on domain D, even in the absence of a domain specific track record.We instinctively watch out for people whose track record proves that they are \"very clever\", and copy them on other matters, hoping to get \"clever person\" results.Artificial intelligence builds towers of super human intellectual performance in an empty waste land. Most Artificial Intelligences are not even stupid away from their special domain, they don&#x27;t work outside of it at all. Even relatively general intelligences, like Chat GPT, have bizarre holes in their intelligence. Large Language Models don&#x27;t know that there is an external world to which language refers and about which language can be right or wrong. Instead they say the kinds of things that humans say, with zero awareness of the risks.And us humans? We cannot help seeing the super human intellectual performance of Alpha Go, beating the World Champion at Go, as some kind of general intellectual validation. It is our human instinct to use a \"spot intelligence and copy from it\" strategy, even, perhaps especially, outside of track record. That is the specific nature of the pareidolia that we need to worry about. It is our nature to treat intelligences as inherently fairly general. Very clever on one thing implies clever on most other things. We are cursed to believe in the intelligence of our computer companions. This will end bad, as we give them serious responsibilities, and they fail, displaying incomprehensible stupidity. reply sadtoot 9 hours agoparentprevdo you think vinge and kurzweil in the 90s and 2000s were imagining the singularity occuring exactly at the advent of LLMs? are you supposing that LLMs are the only viable path towards advanced AI, and that we have now hit a permanent ceiling for AI?AI doesn&#x27;t scare you because you apparently have no sense of perspective or imagination reply kibwen 9 hours agorootparent> AI doesn&#x27;t scare you because you apparently have no sense of perspective or imaginationWe can imagine both of the following: 1. space aliens from Betelgeuse coming down and enslaving humanity to work in the dilithium mines to produce the fuel for their hyperdrives, and 2. the end of civilization via global nuclear war.

You give it a sequence and it predicts the next part of the sequence.As a society we&#x27;ve been dedicating a lot of resources to time series prediction for many years.What makes LLMs culturally significant is that they generate sequences that map to words that seem to humans like intelligent responses.Arguably, it has always been obvious that a sufficiently capable time series predictor would effectively be a super-weapon.Many technological advances that are currently in the realm of sci-fi could be classified similarly.However so could many technologies that are now widespread and largely harmless to the status quo.People worried that the internet would create massive social upheaval. But soon got algorithmic feeds which effectively filter out antisocial content. The masses got mobile phones with cameras, but after a few scandals about police brutality the only place we find significant content about police misconduct is CCP-afiliated TikTok.I think people get squeamish about AI because there are not clear authority structures other than what one can buy with a lot of A100s.

We all know what I’m saying.If the scientists building these systems aren’t credible and the commentators not building these systems aren’t credible, then who is?If the answer is “no one,” okay, cool, that inscrutability is another reason for, not against, caution. reply zer00eyz 3 hours agorootparent>> Many people who are actually making the things closest to what we currently call “AI” are concerned.See grey goo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gray_gooHow about nukes and atmospheric fire: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidescience.org&#x2F;manhattan-project-legacy&#x2F;atmos...> scientists ... credibleThe science ends at the math. Go play with an LLM at home. Run it on your GPU, see what it does, what its limits are. Realize that it&#x27;s a system that never \"grows\", that lacking noise it becomes deterministic. Once you look behind the curtain and find out what&#x27;s there, a lot of the hype to call it AI looks dumb. reply selfhoster11 15 minutes agorootparentI have run an LLM at home, up to 70B models. While I agree with some of what you said, I don&#x27;t really know how it prevents LLMs from being useful.Yes, LLMs currently don&#x27;t learn. This is also true for humans who cannot form new memories. A human who cannot learn anything new besides the contents of their short-term memory is at a huge disadvantage, but (hopefully) no less capable if given access to a scratchpad and more thinking time to compensate.As for the part that they are deterministic lacking noise... Why would you not provide it with noise? Generating randomness is something that modern machines are quite good at, so there isn&#x27;t much of a reason not to inject it at inference time. reply zer00eyz 9 hours agorootparentprevPeople who worry about AI taking over the world need to worry about the world continuing to work.Your average gas station gets gas 2x a day. The electric grid has 100&#x27;s of faults that are worked around and fixed every day. Delivery still are loaded and driven by people.Any AGI that is a threat to humanity has to be suicidal to act on it because of how the world works.Furthermore, if you crack open an LLM and turn OFF the random noise (temperature) it becomes very deterministic. You think our accent to godhood is on the back of a vector map with some noise, I dont know what to tell you. That doesn&#x27;t mean all this ML can&#x27;t change the world, can&#x27;t foster less BS jobs and enable creativity... but I have massive doubts that sentience and sapience are on this path. reply ethanbond 9 hours agorootparentSure hope that intelligence doesn’t roughly mean “ability to find solutions to problems that less intelligent entities can’t discover.”I have no idea what “our ascent to godhood” entails, and it’s hilarious that doomers get criticized for being religious about all this and then you’ll say something like that with a straight face. That’s neat that you “have doubts” sentience and sapience are on this path. You also don’t actually know. reply staunton 7 hours agorootparentprev> Any AGI that is a threat to humanity has to be suicidal to act on it because of how the world worksA \"threat to humanity\" need not mean \"killing all humans next year\". It could just mean some entity gaining permanent control. That situation would be irreversible and humanity would be at the mercy of that entity. Chances are, the entity would have emerged victorious from an evolutionary struggle for power and thus would not care about human flourishing.That entity need not be a single AI. It could be a system like a large corporation or a country where initially a lot of \"small\" decisions are made by AIs. Over time, the influence of humans on this system might diminish and the trend might become irreversible.Currently, no individual and no group, (organization, country...) on the planet has anywhere close to complete control over humanity. Further, even if some country managed to conquer everything, it could not hope to maintain that power indefinitely. An immortal system capable of complete surveillance, however, may be able to maintain power. It&#x27;s a new thing, we don&#x27;t know. \"Sentience\" doesn&#x27;t matter one bit for any of this.Such a system might take centuries to form or it might go quickly. Humans might also go extinct before something like this comes about. However, that doesn&#x27;t mean people who think about such possibilities are stupid. reply greyface- 7 hours agorootparent> That entity need not be a single AI. It could be a system like a large corporationThis is not a new problem, then. Let&#x27;s tackle the issue of corporations, rather than chase an AI boogeyman that doesn&#x27;t fundamentally change anything.Look at oil companies, for example. They have humans in the loop at every level, and yet those humans do little to prevent profit incentives from leading them to destroy the planet. A broken reward function is a broken reward function, AI-assisted or not. reply staunton 2 hours agorootparentAn organization&#x27;s policies are still implemented and maintained by humans. No matter how powerful, the power is transient. You have churn, corruption, incomplete knowledge transfer, etc. AI systems in effective leadership could be able to maintain goals and accumulate power. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s new. reply mlsu 8 hours agorootparentprevThose people (like most people who talk AGI) live in a world far \"above the metal.\" They, like the rationalist bloggers, live in a \"software world,\" far above the constraints of physical reality. This causes an understandable blind spot: the understanding that computers are, fundamentally, physical machines.It&#x27;s quite easy to imagine that you could conjure superintelligence when you are conjuring a pod of 8 quadrillion transistors in a single shell script. The illusion breaks down when you get closer to the physical reality. Reality is that those transistors are made of real materials, with real impurities, that have to be broken down and painstakingly physically, electrically, chemically, debugged, in the world below the 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s abstraction.The commonality that both sides of this silly debate share is that neither really deals with entities at the layer below abstract software (or essays). To them, the perfect world of software is fundamental reality (they spend all of their time there!), and any crystal prism that can be constructed in software can be constructed in reality.Of course, such prisms are instantly shattered when they come into contact with the real world: an impurity in the wafer, a static shock on the PCB before installation, a flood in the datacenter. This software stuff is fragile by default, it actually takes a tremendous amount of active work in the physical reality to conjure it into existence. I can do something that no language model can do, and is showing no signs of being able to do any time soon: drive a car to the datacenter, turn the door handle, and unplug the rack. reply zrezzed 7 hours agorootparent> turn the door handle, and unplug the rack.There are door handles that you cannot turn, and racks you cannot unplug: ones buried deep in the Cheyenne Mountains and hidden far away in the Siberian tundra. They are protected by unfathomably powerful systems, with the support of countless people and backed by the whims global economic power.I say this as someone who likely agrees with you. I think the power of the real world, that of companies, and governments and militaries should decrease our concern with AGI gaining power itself.But I don’t think it’s as obvious as pointing to the fragility of software. Our human systems are fragile too, and subject to manipulation in not-so-different a way as data centers.

Choose your flavor. reply ethanbond 6 hours agorootparentprevSo your argument is that we need not worry because Sutskever and Hinton aren’t aware you can destroy data centers with water or static electricity? reply skepticATX 6 hours agorootparentThe same Hinton who was certain that radiology was solved?The same Sutskever who led OpenAI when they released a neutered GPT-2 because the full model was too dangerous?The problem with the AI safety argument is that it can be boiled down to:1) Assume that we build an all powerful god machine2) The all powerful god machine has the ability to exterminate humanityAll of their work revolves around different ways that 2) might occur. But what I, and many other people, take issue with is whether 1) is even possible, and if it is, if we’re even remotely close to building it.No one ever explains how 1) will be achieved beyond vague handwaving, because no one knows how to build a god machine. replylazide 10 hours agorootparentprevWhen has an ivory tower not involved the ‘most advanced research labs’?Or do you mean largest implementors? reply ethanbond 10 hours agorootparentIvory tower is usually a pejorative term meaning people who are isolated from the reality of the situation.So it doesn’t include the most advanced research labs when those research labs are in touch with the reality of the situation, like right now with AI.Nitpick “most advanced research labs” if you want, it’s obvious what I mean: it is clear that the “shouting” is not coming solely from people who don’t know what’s going on. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentEh, from folks isolated from the constraints and practicalities of the real world.Which OpenAI definitely is, and has been for some time.Or do you think infinite money and ‘do whatever you want’ is constraining? reply ethanbond 9 hours agorootparentWhat does constraints have to do with it? The question is who has the best grasp on the trajectory of the technology.If not the researchers who are at the frontier of building and deploying these systems, playing with next generation iterations and planning several generations forward, then who?Andreessen? People who like playing with LLMs? People who called the OpenAI API? reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentBecause if you don’t have real world constraints (like needing to be profitable, or paying the bill for thermodynamic reality), then ‘anything is possible’.Also if you aren’t dealing with those, then problems that come from that never occur to the person involved.

But I think one&#x27;s feelings on global warming & nukes can be influenced by previous exposure to eschatology. I was raised in American evangelicalism which puts a heavy emphasis on the end of the world stuff. I left the church behind long ago. But the heavy diet of Revelations, etc. has left me with a nihilism I can&#x27;t shake. That whatever humanity does is doomed to fail.Of course, that isn&#x27;t necessarily true. I know there&#x27;s always a chance we somehow muddle through. Even a chance that we one day fix things. But, emotionally, I can&#x27;t shake that feeling of inevitable apocalypse.Weirdly enough, I feel completely neutral on AI. No doomerism on that subject.

We&#x27;ve seen this over and over throughout history. So far, we&#x27;re still here. That isn&#x27;t because we weren&#x27;t concerned, but because we dealt with the problems in front of us a day at a time. reply ethanbond 10 hours agorootparentThe people who, from Trinity (or before), were worried about global annihilation and scrambled to build systems to prevent it were correct.

Yes it&#x27;s a fancy sentence generator, the problem is that you already have greedy bastards talking about replacing millions of people with that fancy sentence generator.I truly think it&#x27;s going to lead to a massive shift in economic equality, and not in favor of the masses but instead in favor of the psychopathic C-suite like Altman and his ilk. reply staunton 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m personally least worried about short-term unemployment resulting from AI progress. Such structural unemployment and poverty resulting from it happens when a region loses the industry that is close to the single employer there and people affected don&#x27;t have the means to move elsewhere or change careers.AI is going to replace jobs that can be done remotely from anywhere in the world. The people affected will (for the first time in history!) not mostly be the poorest and disenfranchised parts of society.Therefore, as long as countries can maintain political power in their populations, the labor market transition will mostly be fine. The part where we \"maintain political power in populations\" is what worries me personally. AI enables mass surveillance and personalized propaganda. Let&#x27;s see how we deal with those appearing, which will be sudden by history&#x27;s standards... The printing press (30 years war, witch-hunts) and radio (Hitler, Rwandan genocide) might be slow and small innovations compared at what might be to come. reply jmoak3 6 hours agorootparentWith respect to communication innovation, I think AI Hitler put it best: \"we can&#x27;t rewind we&#x27;ve gone too far.\"Here&#x27;s a link to the relevant historical record: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=25GjijODWoI&t=93sI don&#x27;t think existing media channels will continue to be an effective way to disseminate information. The noise destroys the usefulness of it. I think people will stop coming to platforms for news and entertainment as they begin to distrust them.The surveillance prospect however, is frightening. reply __loam 4 hours agorootparentI think people aren&#x27;t thinking about these things in the aggregate enough. In the long term, this does a lot of damage to existing communication infrastructure. Productivity alone isn&#x27;t necessarily a virtue. reply jmoak3 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve recently switched to a dumb phone.

I can be more slow and careful about what I read and consume from my desktop, from trusted sources. I&#x27;m insulated from viral images sent hastily to me via social media, from thumbnails of twitter threads of people with no care if they&#x27;re right or wrong, from texts containing links with juicy headlines that I have no hope of critically examining while briefly checking my phone in traffic.This is all infinitely worse in a world where content can be generated by multi-modal LLMs.I have no way to know if any of the horrific images&#x2F;videos I&#x27;ve already seen thru the outlets I&#x27;ve identified were real or AI generated. I&#x27;ll never know, but it&#x27;s too important to leave to chance. For that reason I&#x27;m trying something new to set myself up for success. I&#x27;m still informed, but my information intake is deliberately slowed. I think that others may follow in time, in various ways. replyethanbond 9 hours agorootparentprevIt’s kind of infuriating to see people put trench warfare or mustard gas on the same pedestal as a tiny reaction that couldn’t even light a lightbulb.There are different sets of concerns for the current crop of “really computationally intense text generators” and the overall trajectory of AI and the field’s governance track record. reply cornel_io 5 hours agorootparentprev...you do realize that a year or two into the earliest investigations into nuclear reactions what you would have measured was less energy emission than a match being lit, right?The question is, \"Can you create a chain reaction that grows?\", and the answer is unclear right now with AI, but it&#x27;s hard to say with any confidence that the answer is \"no\". Most experts five years ago would have confidently declared that passing the Turing test was decades to centuries away, if it ever happened, but it turned out to just require beefing up an architecture that was already around and spending some serious cash. I have similarly low faith that the experts today have a good sense that e.g. you can&#x27;t train an LLM to do meaningful LLM research. Once that&#x27;s possible, the sky is the limit, and there&#x27;s really no predicting what these systems could or could not do. reply __loam 4 hours agorootparentIt seems like a very flawed line of reasoning to compare very early days nuclear science to an AI system that has already scaled up substantially.Regarding computing technology, I think the positive feedback you&#x27;re describing happened with chip design and vlsi stuff, eg. better computers help design the next generation of chips or help lead to materials breakthroughs. I&#x27;m willing to believe LLMs have a macro effect on knowledge work in a similar way search engines, but as you said, it remains to be seen whether the models can feed back into their own development. From what I can tell, gpu speed and efficiency along with better data sets are the most important inputs for these things.

You could still create cults around them, for example, by claiming nuclear war is imminent or needed or some other end-of-times view. reply ethanbond 10 hours agorootparentThere were people who were concerned about global annihilation from pretty much the moment the atom was first split. Those people were correct in their concerns and they were correct to act on those concerns. reply RandomLensman 9 hours agorootparentIn a way, they were not correct so far (in part also because of their actions, but not only due to their actions). reply ethanbond 9 hours agorootparentPretty much exclusively due to their actions and some particularities of the specific technology which don’t seem to apply to AI. reply RandomLensman 9 hours agorootparentIf you put, for example, US presidents in the concerned group, i.e., actual decision makers then fair enough. But it wasn&#x27;t just concerned scientists and the public. reply ethanbond 9 hours agorootparentUhh correct. Unsurprisingly though, many of the people with the deepest insight and farthest foresight were the people closest to the science. Many more were philosophers and political theorists, or “ivory tower know-nothings.” reply RandomLensman 9 hours agorootparentMaybe. There were also those scientists working actively on various issues of deterrence, including on how to prevail and fight if things were to happen - and there were quite a few different schools of thought during the cold war (the political science of deterrence was quite different from physical science of weapons, too).But the difference to AI is that nuclear weapons were then shown to exist. If the lowest critical mass had turned out to be a trillion tons, the initial worries would have been unfounded. replymakeitdouble 10 hours agorootparentprevBeing concerned and making it part of your identify are two very different things.

When people use words like “limitless,” it’s hard to take what they are saying seriously.But,> AI is expensive as hell to run, and more advanced systems might require more and more computation. We can only build so many GPUsWhile certainly not using techniques like LLMs, we do know you can get some decent intelligence out of a 23 watt analog computer, the human brain.So it is plausible that we could find algos + hardware which use 100W of power, and are quite a bit smarter than a human. Multiply that times a multi-megawatt datacenter, and the availability of some level of super intelligence might appear to be relatively “limitless.” re",

    "originLink": "https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/forget-spaceships-i-just-want-my-music",
    "originBody": "December 12, 2023 A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, \"what songs do you want me to play?\" They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and usually the songs are tolerable, at least. But a few albums, like Bluey's soundtrack, transcend the children's genre. They're genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car. Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you, besides a few duds, Ladybug Music slaps. And the songs incorporate diverse styles, too, it's not just the same nursery rhymes regurgitated in a bubbly voice. So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed out. I tapped one, and nothing. Just this notice: Not available in my region? Well, that's weird. I pay for Apple Music. And I know the artist is in the US, and I'm in the US... But my kids were restless, and we had somewhere to be, so I put on Pinkfong for the drive. After I got home, I went online to investigate. This blog post is a transcript of this video on my YouTube channel. Unfortunately, Ladybug music isn't a huge artist, so there wasn't any news coverage, like \"thousands of parents cry out as their favorite kids songs disappear from Apple Music!\" But I did find the Ladybug Music website. And on that website, they have a shop. Great! I can just buy the CDs, and support the artist directly! And... no. Apparently Ladybug music is now an app. So I downloaded the App! Long story short, I created an account, and found out you either have to fly to LA and join one of the in-person kids music courses, or pay $3000 in licensing fees to get access to any of the songs. Note: I've also reached out to Ladybug Music using their contact form to ask about any other way to purchase the music, and have received no response. No bueno. Scrounging around, you can get a few free songs from their YouTube or Soundcloud, and on Amazon a couple of used CDs are floating around... but there's literally no way to buy the music online anymore! This isn't the first time I've seen a song disappear from Apple Music. And this kind of thing happens on Spotify and other streaming services too. I can't get too mad, because I never actually \"bought\" those songs directly. I just rented them. That's the model for video streaming too, like on Netflix. Even though it's super annoying to have shows and music disappear, I am renting, so it's not like I have a right to anything. Playstation But that's just streaming. Luckily, you can also buy digital movies and music, and you get to keep it. Right? Right? Wrong. Enshittification has reached new heights, as Sony just decided to yoink over a thousand seasons—that's right, seasons, not episodes—of Discovery shows from the PlayStation Store. But they're not just removing them from the store. They're removing them from people's libraries. As of 31 December 2023, due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers, you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library. (Source) So if you paid full retail price for Mythbusters on your PlayStation, too bad. You can't watch it anymore. That is, unless you go over and set up a new subscription to yet another completely unneccessary and broken streaming service from Warner Brothers. The term for that is enshittification. I'm not gonna rehash everything Cory Doctorow wrote about this latest assault on digital ownership, but I'll summarize a few of the main things that get under my skin. First, the headline: \"If buying isn't owning, then piracy isn't stealing.\" I made a whole video about how I manage all my video content on my NAS. I run software called Jellyfin, and I've ripped hundreds of movies and thousands of TV episodes over the years. My family can enjoy every movie and TV show I've bought, now and forever. But most people don't do that. And even for crazies like me, it's getting harder. More and more TV series and movies are going stream-only. Meaning the only way to ever watch it is to subscribe to yet another broken and temporary streaming service. You'd think as the years wore on, society's access to media would get easier and better. But instead, backwards-thinking execs in Hollywood and the music industry keep backpedaling, making it harder for you to actually watch the content they produce. I mean, more and more of it is garbage anyway, but there are still compelling shows and movies out there. It's a shame they're committed to being so anti-consumer by killing off any semblance of ownership. In my video about Jellyfin, I danced around the issue of piracy. Mostly because I know how pernicious the MPAA and RIAA are. Well, you know what? I still don't officially endorse pirating content. But if there's literally no other way to view the content you already paid for? Who am I to judge? And cracking DRM? First of all, it's laughable how bad DRM normally is. But second, DRM is the enabler of all the horrible, scummy business practices that lead to so much e-waste, and to kids being disappointed in their Dad for not being able to play music that's been available digitally for years. So if you crack DRM to truly own the things you already paid for? Yeah, I don't got a problem with that. Forget spaceships flying to Mars, I just want my music.

Funny how software, on one hand, gets unprecedentedly complex for what it’s doing as hardware enables it, and how lazy, on the other hand, the software development at a poor starving trillion-dollar company has got. Another possible reason for the message, which changes about nothing whatsoever about how rotten the whole situation is, that copyright holders may lapse prolonging their license or availability or what have they. I’m not saying it from experience, but I’ve seen music being greyed out for a couple days and then getting reinstated back enough times to suspect that this must look like certificate renewal, and we well know how that sucks at times, especially if you have a band/label manager or an underling who is not a techie on the other end. I’d like to hear from people publishing music to these platforms if they have such controls and how easy it is to make a mistake there.

I wanted to post a song from a somewhat obscure &#x27;80s band on my website and so tracked them down and asked for permission.One of them (the songwriter) responded to say that the band has never had the rights to the music on that album and, in fact, they don&#x27;t even have a recording of it themselves. In his words \"as far as I&#x27;m concerned, you can do whatever you want with that stuff\". I posted the song and sent him a high-quality copy of the album it came from. reply joemi 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not complicated, though. The artist is not the seller. The artist already sold their rights. Whoever bought the rights is the seller. You might choose to disregard that because the artist said they don&#x27;t care, but their opinion is meaningless, so it should not be the basis of your argument. reply JohnFen 10 hours agorootparentI was responding to this: \"People would argue that it&#x27;s up to the seller whether they want to make their creations available.\"The use of the phrase \"their creations\" led to to think that the people being discussed here were the artists, not the rightsholders. Only the artists are the creators.My argument is that this is complex because the system of legal rights is complex. The people that you think have them are often not the artists. I&#x27;m not actually seeing how you have argued against this -- have I misunderstood what you&#x27;re saying? reply joemi 10 hours agorootparentI agree with your argument as stated here (\"this is complex because the system of legal rights is complex\"). I guess your example seemed to me to be an endorsement of relying on the creators opinion and not the rights-holder in cases where they are not the same, and I was arguing against that (assumed?) endorsement. The fact that the creators are not necessarily the sellers is at the heart of a lot of pro-piracy arguments and I&#x27;ve often seen it used as blanket justification for _any_ piracy, even in cases where the rights-holders and creators are the same entities, so I guess I&#x27;m a bit sensitive to it.Side note: I used to co-run a small electronic record label, and almost all of the artists who we released music by were just ourselves (with a few exceptions made for close friends, who retained all rights to their music). Given our small size and low profile, it was shocking to see how quickly some of our releases were pirated. Sometimes albums would hit soulseek after we had only shipped out the first 30 or so CDs (and no MP3s). We weren&#x27;t in it for the money... it was just a side-activity while we were still in school, and any money made was just funneled back into the label so we could release more music, so fortunately the piracy didn&#x27;t affect us much as far as we cared. But it was still incredibly surprising. reply JohnFen 10 hours agorootparent> I guess your example seemed to me to be an endorsement of relying on the creators opinion and not the rights-holder in cases where they are not the same, and I was arguing against that (assumed?) endorsement.I was not endorsing anything. My intent was to tell an interesting anecdote that illustrated the complexity of rights. Sorry for the confusion.My personal attitude (not endorsing it, though!) is that the artists are the only people who really count. That&#x27;s why I contacted them for permission. Beyond the artists, everything is just legalisms and how seriously to take their desires is a legal consideration, not an ethical one. My anecdote does indicate this in action pretty clearly, but it conflates that attitude with the main point I was making (that this stuff isn&#x27;t simple). reply joemi 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between one&#x27;s personal attitude (voluntarily made public) and one&#x27;s endorsement. IMO they are one in the same. I only bring this up because you&#x27;ve made the point to say you&#x27;re not endorsing what you personally believe.Why would the artists be the only people who really count, when they made an agreement to let the someone else handle the selling? Doesn&#x27;t that by default mean that what the artist _wanted_ was to let someone else handle the selling? replyvanchor3 13 hours agorootparentprev> People would argue that it&#x27;s up to the seller whether they want to make their creations available. If I don&#x27;t want to sell you something, then I&#x27;d entertain the argument that downloading it anyway is in some sense immoral or unethical.I would say another key distinction is between \"don&#x27;t want to sell&#x2F;can&#x27;t sell\" vs \"don&#x27;t want you to buy\". In the former it may be because the owner does not want to go through the trouble of selling it or is no longer around to sell it. I know some people have given up because the effort to deal with \"trolls\" (particularly DMCA and fakes) has either turned their passion into a nightmare or it&#x27;s not really their passion anymore and they don&#x27;t want to deal with it. reply BobaFloutist 13 hours agorootparentprevI agree (or at least see the argument) if it&#x27;s like the original creator who decided they want to keep their hands on the work (or maybe like if a company wants to withdraw one edition of a book to sell a new edition), but in cases where works are orphaned, or the rights are in limbo, or a huge corporation merges with another huge corporation and permanently deletes creators&#x27; works for a tax break, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real argument.If I Johnny writer am like \"Ok when I was 15 I thought that many consecutive slurs was funny, but now the alt-right is rallying around what was supposed to be satire, so I want it off the market\" that&#x27;s kind of reasonable. If James Writerson has classics that are kind of out of fashion and got converted to ebooks by Big Publisher™ which was then bought by Bigger Publisher™ who decides it&#x27;s not worth the money to keep the classics on the market (but also refuses to release them back to the estate of James Writerson or to the general public), that&#x27;s less reasonable. reply joemi 10 hours agorootparentBasing something like this on someone else&#x27;s motive doesn&#x27;t seem like the best idea to me because in most situations you can only guess the motive.

Maddy&#x27;s comment was basically the same.

In the modern world, probably the by-the-numbers majority of working artists in every medium can effectively self-publish to some degree or another, so as the intermediaries have grown more and more demanding and both creator- and consumer-hostile, they have also become less of a necessary evil for our ability to engage with the works creative people are putting out into the world. Piracy is the most natural and reasonable way to use current technology to consume media, and the massively successful propaganda campaigns to instill a folk belief that it&#x27;s somehow wrong or doing harm are incredible, given how much quality of life for both the producers and consumers of the actual content is lost in the name of marginal gains in profitability and massive gains in control by intermediary conglomerates that are increasingly unnecessary. It is only by a combination of this mythology and the ever-tighter industry collusion with an increasingly authoritarian surveillance state to make laws to terrorize people who just want their music that this parasitic shape the industry has taken is survivingTo me, the notion that a transferrable market-monopoly ownership of intellectual rights to a creative work was ever about helping creators is the kind of ridiculous farce that people like economists can get away with because we&#x27;ve been trained to believe that fancy experts saying counterintuitive things about \"incentives\" must know something we don&#x27;t, but even if you believe intellectual property has value, it is not of value for massive corporations to sit on a chokepoint between human beings and their access to their own cultural touchstones reply RecycledEle 15 hours agoprevThe Chinese system of central libraries is better than copyright.Imagine having every book ever written, for free, all your life.Imagine authors and inventors being compensated twice what they are usually paid in the USA, while the corporate lawyers panhandle.I know the lawyers would end up as party higher-ups still screwing us, but I can dream. reply rakoo 14 hours agoparentA central, government-run library only shifts censorship from \"not profitable\" to \"not in line with authority\".
