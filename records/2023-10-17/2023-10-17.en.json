Oct 16, 2023, 12:23 PM PDT|20 Comments / 20 New Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge One of the worst tech labor years ever continues with the news that roughly half of Bandcamp employees have been laid off. Bandcamp employees are reporting the news via social media. about half the company was laid off today. some of the most incredible people i’ve ever worked with, including two of my amazing editorial colleagues @diamonde and @atoosamoinzadeh and most of the incredible support staff among many others. this is a loss, no two ways about it — jj skolnik (@modernistwitch) October 16, 2023 Epic Games bought the indie music platform back in 2022 for an undisclosed amount before selling it barely a year later. Late last month, Epic Games laid off 16 percent of its workforce, or 830 employees, due to what CEO Tim Sweeney described as overspending. Epic also revealed that it would sell the Bandcamp business to California-based music licensing company Songtradr. In that announcement, Epic disclosed that an additional 250 people would be leaving Epic either through receiving offers from Songtradr or Epic’s divesture from its SuperAwesome ad business. Employees who did not receive offers from Songtradr were notified today and will be eligible for severance. In an email to The Verge, Songtradr confirmed that 50 percent of Bandcamp employees have been extended offers to join Songtradr and reaffirmed from a previous statement the company’s commitment to keeping the Bandcamp experience the same. Songtradr’s statement also confirmed that its purchase of Bandcamp had been completed, but it did not confirm if it would voluntarily recognize Bandcamp’s union that employees won earlier this year, despite pressure from employees and the Bandcamp community. 20 COMMENTS20 NEW Most Popular Analogue is making a 4K Nintendo 64 Lakers legend Rick Fox built a house that can suck CO2 out of the atmosphere The Meta glassholes have arrived About half of Bandcamp employees have been laid off Apple rumors of refreshed iPads could mean new chips or new Pencils Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

I don&#x27;t know the answers in this case (not sure if anyone does?) but I think it is naive to assume that Bandcamp was wise to be employing all these people. While acquisitions tanking a company with stupid decisions are super common, it&#x27;s also super common for companies who are trying to look like they are growing (for future funding or acquisitions) to have way too much staff (and thus, high a burn rate) instead of running a sensible, profitable business. It is not necessarily a good thing that they have tons of employees - sometimes it&#x27;s entirely motivated by putting lipstick on a pig in order to look like a runaway growth success thing.Songtradr is in the music infrastructure business. I think it&#x27;s quite possible they are cleaning house to make Bandcamp a more viable business that is actually focused on their core business. Doesn&#x27;t seem impossible to me that Bandcamp was way off base trying to make too much written content when really, it&#x27;s about selling music.But I&#x27;m spitballing here, anyone know more about whether Bandcamp was bloated? reply matthewn 10 hours agoparentBandcamp had 118 employees total. That doesn&#x27;t smell bloated to me.(Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;article&#x2F;bandcamp-layoffs-oakland...) reply iainctduncan 8 hours agorootparentSo we work for private equity mostly, and they are in the business of buying and selling steady growth, profitable businesses, as opposed to VC&#x2F;bubble stuff, so our expectations are a lot leaner. But at a guess, I think we&#x27;d expect that to be a 40-50 person company. 118 seems high.The app is tiny, it has changed very little in who knows how long. Infrastructure is obviously the big thing, so there would be a solid size infra team. Then standard business, product, marketing stuff. I just can&#x27;t see that warranting more than 50 people unless it&#x27;s raking it in. Sounds like they could be wasting money on marketing initiatives that may or may not be worth anything at all. Six full time writers seems pretty out there given the questionable ROI of those articles.Obviously, take this with a huge a grain of salt as this is a guess based on being a frequent user of the app, and having done about 60 diligences and been a part of another 30 or 40 in review capacity. But it seems significantly oversized on what I normally see looking at business that have to be run sustainably. For whatever that&#x27;s worth!EDIT: someone had a good point that bandcamp takes international payments, which is complex. So I would revise my first WAG up based on that for sure. Thinking further I would probably guess 50-60 people - which is about what I guess it is after the layoffs. Still a total WAG, but slightly better informed... reply nluken 6 hours agorootparentYour view of bandcamp seems like a cartoonishly perfect representation of a consultant’s perspective with very little understanding of what the company actually does beyond the balance sheet. It’s the kind of no-skin-in-the-game perspective that ruined Boeing, and it’s why most folks absolutely abhor private equity.Bandcamp has been successful because of the trust they have within the internet music community. It’s not a very complicated product, but people buy music there because the whole thing feels like it’s a part of the music scene, not the tech or business scene. Given that the Daily is well regarded in that community, I highly doubt those six writers, who were likely paid significantly less than the median staff member, were the problem here. Even if they didn’t have the purely trackable ROI, they were a huge part of the platform’s only moat: its goodwill with the artists and listeners who used it.I would also add that Bandcamp was pretty publicly profitable prior to their sale to Epic. Given that they didn’t significantly grow the staff after the acquisition, they would have had to make huge blunders in a very short period of time they owned it. So at this point we’re talking about laying folks off purely for better looking numbers, not really for sustainability. reply iainctduncan 6 hours agorootparentYou are making some wildy off base assumptions. I&#x27;m not a finance guy, I&#x27;m a hacker. We do technical diligence. I was a developer for 20 years and am doing a music and CS phd right now. I&#x27;ve slung code in over a dozen languages, I&#x27;m the open source developer of Scheme for Max and the csound6~ port to Max, an electronic composer, and a gigging musician. I am currently bootstrapping a music education product in Python, Javascript, C++, and Scheme. You would be very hard pressed to find someone as embedded in the problem domain of bandcamp who also does acquisitions related work.So I use bandcamp all the time, I have purchased tons of music on it, and the articles have not made any difference to me as a user at all. The only thing I care about is the band I&#x27;m purchasing from! I use bandcamp for three reasons: lossless audio, no DRM, fair payments to the band. None of those are at all relevant to their article efforts.As for most people abhoring PE, believe me, I am under no illusions about our clients. But most software company exits are now PE deals (something like over 75%), so while people might like to make public noises about hating PE, they sure like to sell their companies to them. reply disposition2 39 minutes agorootparent> So I use bandcamp all the time, I have purchased tons of music on it, and the articles have not made any difference to me as a user at all. The only thing I care about is the band I&#x27;m purchasing from! I use bandcamp for three reasons: lossless audio, no DRM, fair payments to the band. None of those are at all relevant to their article efforts.Just to add a conflicting opinion, I love the articles and often use them for music discovery and purchases. Of course, the primary function is to purchase music from known entities but the discovery part keeps me coming back. In terms of ROI, to me the articles seem like a pretty smart marketing move…without them I would not have discovered all kinds of artists and made numerous purchases. reply nluken 6 hours agorootparentprevApologies on misunderstanding your role here, most of the speculation on this thread has been related to finances and staffing so I made an assumption there when I shouldn’t have.> I have purchased tons of music on it, and the articles have not made any difference to me as a user at alln=1, but that’s true of my perspective as well so perhaps it’s a wash. I do think the editorial staff were more important to some genres than others.> they sure like to sell their companies to themI might suggest that this is a case where upper management’s desires directly conflict with the people making the noise (staff and users) reply PhasmaFelis 6 hours agorootparentprev> while people might like to make public noises about hating PE, they sure like to sell their companies to them.I suspect that there&#x27;s not a lot of overlap between people who publicly fume about good companies being ruined by profit-hungry buyers, and people who start companies explicitly so they can flip them to profit-hungry buyers and ditch.Does anyone still start businesses with the intention of building and maintaining a really excellent product&#x2F;service in the long term? Do any of them hold on to that ideal after a few years? reply shiroiuma 5 hours agorootparent>Does anyone still start businesses with the intention of building and maintaining a really excellent product&#x2F;service in the long term? Do any of them hold on to that ideal after a few years?Define \"a few\". You can&#x27;t expect most company owners to want to continue running that company for decades on end; eventually, they want to do something else or retire. So at some point, they have to sell. Who&#x27;s going to buy an existing company that&#x27;s profitable? Someone who&#x27;s \"profit-hungry\" usually. If the company is just a passion project, no one buys it and it just goes under when the owner gets tired of it. reply watwut 4 hours agorootparentI know companies that exist for years and years and even get inherited. I even work in one.It exists, just not in SV reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparentInheritance assumes that the founder&#x27;s kids actually want to run their parent&#x27;s company. Many times, they don&#x27;t, so they sell. Running a company is a pain in the ass, so it&#x27;s understandable many people don&#x27;t want to be bothered. reply tacocataco 4 hours agorootparentprevDepending on the size, the city&#x2F;state could purchase the company and loan it to the employees.If the the loan gets paid off, boom... co-op equally owned by the workers. reply WJW 3 hours agorootparentAnd if the loan doesn&#x27;t get paid off? That city&#x2F;state is now in a huge hole, having spent money that could&#x27;ve been used to build schools and maintain roads on buying companies off their retiring owners.In any case I don&#x27;t see why you would need the detour via local government? A bank could lend the money to the group of employees just fine. reply lotsofpulp 3 hours agorootparentprevSounds like the perfect recipe for corruption. reply stana 4 hours agorootparentprevAs cheap money era seems to be ending, long term quality product&#x2F;service might be the only viable strategy going forward. reply iainctduncan 6 hours agorootparentprevInteresting little aside for those reacting to the fact that it&#x27;s PE who pay our bills. While the world of vampire PE certainly exists, most of the time the clients I interact with are genuinely concerned with how to make the business better. And we are far more frequently telling acquirers to spend top dollar on new hires than advising on who to cut! The expectation is that the company needs investment, and that they will get 20% year over year growth for about five years. While the bad rep of PE certainly came from somewhere, in my expereince over the last five years of working in the field, I would way rather be at a profitable, sensible, PE owned company than a VC funded \"disruptor\" gunning for the big IPO or google acquisition. Our world is positively normal compared to the FAANG scene. We see people who have been at at the companies for 10 to 15 years all the time.Seriously, I feel like a broken record when I say \"Hire a top drawer test automation engineer to lead the company in how to run QA properly - this should be a senior developer\" etc. reply js2 4 hours agorootparent> we are far more frequently telling acquirers to spend top dollar on new hires than advising on who to cutPlease tell that to Apollo Global Management as loudly as you can. I mean, if they&#x27;re one of your customers. reply iainctduncan 7 hours agorootparentprevOf course if they are doing really well, than their infrastructure&#x2F;scaling problem could be the big issue (and thus the big expense), and it could be at the point where improving those margins is worth throwing developers at it.I have also seen some eye watering monthly AWS bills where it makes total sense to hire a bunch of devs to bring those down by even a few percent. reply ipaddr 7 hours agorootparentprevAccounting, human resources, sales (different than marketing), managers, security, operations, analysts, C-Suit, customer service, etc not including technical teams developers, sprint masters, qa, analysts, data warehousing, networking, support, devops, thought leaders. reply iainctduncan 7 hours agorootparentYeah, we know all that, I mean that&#x27;s literally what we do. But I can tell you that I have seen companies with the same feature scope range over an order of magnitude in seats. There&#x27;s a lot of overhiring in this business.We often look at private companies going from initial bootstrap to their first exit, and I&#x27;m telling you, those are a whole different ball of wax. They manage to do a shit ton with not very many people. reply flatline 7 hours agorootparentprevYou really don’t need a ton of staff dedicated to those things in a 100 person company. This is still a small business by most measures. A C Suite? It could be a sole owner still at that size, though it is stretching the margins. Roles tend to be less differentiated in small companies, and many of those functions are filled informally.That being said, 118 still sounds pretty lean for the scale they are operating at. reply ekianjo 6 hours agorootparentprevYou dont have all this in most small sized companies. Silos exist only when you grow big. reply cmckn 6 hours agorootparentI’ve never seen these kind of roles even in huge companies. “Sprint master” as a job description? Can’t be serious. reply eru 5 hours agorootparentWell, I&#x27;ve heard of &#x27;scum masters&#x27; (sorry, scrum masters) as a job description. So &#x27;sprint master&#x27; doesn&#x27;t sound too ridiculous by comparison. reply pharmakom 3 hours agorootparentprevThey run something equivalent to Spotify at a much smaller scale. reply mbesto 8 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t know Bandcamp&#x27;s revenue, so how on earth could you smell their bloat? reply manxman 7 hours agorootparentWhatsapp wasCan’t you outsource all that to AWS?At a large enough scale you will still need a lot of people dealing with infra. AWS is not magic> 118 people just sounds like “hiring for the sake of hiring” to me.You&#x27;ll need 20+ people just to deal with copyright issues on a daily basis. replyye-olde-sysrq 14 hours agoparentprevprior to this, bandcamp was owned by Epic and lord only knows why they bought them or what their bigger plan was. i also have no idea how much they staffed up under epic rule since they went from a small business to being owned by the fortnite money man. Entirely possible it&#x27;s something like:1. bandcamp is a sustainable normal small-to-medium business growing healthily2. Epic has tons of fortnitebux and is feuding with apple so they buy bandcamp as some kind of tangential play should they end up as a big alternative store on iOS. so they could have a music store offering (to compare to itunes? not that apple gives a crap about itunes anymore??) in addition to an app store?3. the money music stops and everyone races for a seat. bandcamp is left hanging.4. epic sells bandcamp to whoever just to get it off the books so they can focus on fortnite lootboxes5. songtradr or whatever their name is tells the union to pound sand and cuts bandcamp down to a core team because they&#x27;re planning to just gut the product and transition all these indie artists over to whatever platform they were running before. This is a music IP company. I don&#x27;t think they want to handle B2C purchases or provide streaming music. They just wanted to buy a big pot of artists and IP to add to their collection. reply btown 11 hours agorootparentAlternate, equally speculative but less cynical take on 4-5, largely advised by Songtradr&#x27;s announcement here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;songtradr&#x2F;status&#x2F;1709986126117630051?s=2...This may have been a last-minute accelerated deal process where Epic would have all but shuttered Bandcamp if a buyer couldn&#x27;t be found, before they needed to announce massive layoffs to assuage investors. Songtradr is given an opportunity to see the deal, wants to ensure Bandcamp&#x27;s survival in its current form (because its demise would hurt the entire ecosystem Songtradr depends on).But Songtradr isn&#x27;t given time to put together a transition plan or identify the exact legal path to deal with the union (especially given that they&#x27;re in an entirely different country with different labor laws!) and not expose themselves to liability. So they announce conditional openness to the acquisition (per the link above, the transaction hasn&#x27;t closed yet), and this at minimum gives Bandcamp a stay of execution while they identify next steps.Now, they&#x27;ve identified at least one next step - how much of the current Bandcamp costs they can carry during the transition - and that&#x27;s 50% of current staff. A tough call to make, but if the alternative was shuttering the service, a very justifiable one. reply elabajaba 9 hours agorootparentEpic is private, Tim Sweeney owns >50%, and their only real rival in the game engine space had recently torpedoed themselves which caused a large amount of gamedevs and even some publishers to swear off Unity.There was no investor pressure. reply solardev 9 hours agorootparentTencent owns 40% of Epic, and Epic lost most of its legal battle against Apple. reply yankput 1 hour agorootparentprevEpic is underperforming reply Sakos 9 hours agorootparentprevExcept Bandcamp wasn&#x27;t at risk of shutting down before Epic. If it&#x27;s being run unsustainably now, that&#x27;s on Epic. reply noirscape 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s largely a distinction without a difference while Epic still owned (owns? seem deal isn&#x27;t closed yet) them. If Epic is in peril, Bandcamp is in peril since they owned Bandcamp up until recently, and we know Epic is in financial trouble because of the Epic Games Store.Their entire minimum revenue guarantee scheme to lure over indies and publishers is apparently extremely expensive for Epic and the store has yet to turn a profit on the whole. Before, they could run it off of Fortnite profits alone. That said, Sweeney has admitted that well is basically running dry and it&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve been doing layoffs and the like everywhere.If a company is in trouble, the first thing on the line are the subsidiaries and Bandcamp is a questionable acquisition on the Epic rep sheet, being a music store for a company whose main business is making videogames and selling a gaming engine to people. That means it either goes under or is sold off because it&#x27;s seen as an irrelevant \"aside\" subsidiary. reply throw_nbvc1234 9 hours agorootparentprevWas anything in danger of shutting down before Q1 2022? All time tech market highs were ~3-6 months beforehand and presumably the acquisition negotiation took time. reply FormerBandmate 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat do tech unions even do? Doesn’t seem like they can prevent this at all reply phatskat 4 hours agorootparentThey would have to do what any union does - leverage worker power. If the majority of Bandcamp engineers agreed to halt work until x demands are met, it would drive Bandcamp as a service into the ground. Tech workers also hold the keys to everything - they could take the site down, lock up the music, etc.They maybe can’t prevent it, but they could leverage BC&#x2F;Epic&#x2F;whomever into providing some kind of decent severance for those left out in the cold. In theory. reply sitharus 14 hours agorootparentprevOn point 5, bandcamp doesn’t own any rights to the music on the site. The artist agreement is limited to the service of selling music, if that changes the artists can revoke their agreement. reply fencepost 8 hours agorootparentPretty sure there&#x27;s value in owning a platform where small independent (\"undiscovered\") artists release their work and where listeners go to find that work. In particular, it seems likely that having the metrics and historical data could give SongTradr insight into which artists seem likely to catch on, etc. reply nerdponx 5 hours agorootparentAI training set reply southwesterly 14 hours agorootparentprevThat can change. reply sitharus 13 hours agorootparentIt can, but not retrospectively. reply Kye 12 hours agorootparent\"By continuing to use Bandcamp, you agree...\"What&#x27;s an artist who depends on the platform to do? reply jjulius 10 hours agorootparentThat would be the worst move Songtradr could make here. The ability to distribute your music while maintaining the rights to it is one of the main reasons - hell, if not the main reason - artists and labels (and fans like myself) love Bandcamp. Making such a change would, to my mind, royally piss off the entire community and, in particular, the artists that make the platform as successful as it has been. I can only imagine the negative press that such a move would generate. reply rchaud 12 hours agorootparentprevMove their music off it. It happens a lot. If a band&#x27;s earlier Bandcamp album gets picked up by a label, they will insist on exclusive distribution, so the band will remove it from BC. reply jasonjayr 10 hours agorootparentTo where? Because as a buyer of music I like BC&#x27;s deal and would love to make sure alternatives have similar arrangements? reply initplus 10 hours agorootparentprevIf Bandcamp were to try such a move they would destroy the value of their business overnight. Retroactively changing the agreement with your customers about their IP is the best way to permanently destroy trust. reply redwall_hp 9 hours agorootparentIt would be a more dramatic overnight loss of customers than Unity. It&#x27;s entirely laughable, and given that laws restrict the licensing and royalties of music, it might not even be legal.Labels can only write up contracts giving them rights because they pay for studio time (given them a financial buy-in to the creation of the music) and pay advances against royalties. Not so for indie distributors. I don&#x27;t know if there are specific applicable laws, but it&#x27;s absurd enough that everyone would immediately drop Bandcamp.Music royalty rates, for physical records, radio and internet streaming, are also determined by a panel of judges: the United States Copyright Royalty Board. reply sdenton4 8 hours agorootparentprev\"Pray we do not alter it further...\"I guess that only works for Darth Vader. reply letitbeirie 9 hours agorootparentprevNot saying they won&#x27;t try, but there are enough label-represented bands on Bandcamp that they would obliterate their back catalog (along with any network effects they&#x27;re enjoying) overnight. reply toopok4k3 4 hours agorootparentprevTechnically Bandcamp is a very simple payment and file host.A small team can quickly copy how it works and get all the artists to move platform if they were to shoot themself in the head.

Epic can&#x27;t let that cancer spread to the game devs so they sell it off as quickly as possible. reply tessierashpool 10 hours agorootparentprevbandcamp was owned by Epic and lord only knows why they bought them or what their bigger plan wasthis is incorrect. in addition to whatever lord you are speaking of, I also know. (unless you meant me, but even then, I think others share this knowledge.)Epic bought Bandcamp to use it as a weapon in various lawsuits against Google and Apple over their pricing models. Bandcamp joined a suit against Google over its Play Store pricing in particular.it didn&#x27;t go anywhere, because Bandcamp already qualified for media app pricing, which rendered its role in the suit meaningless. but that was why Epic bought Bandcamp. reply RF_Savage 4 hours agorootparentYep, that&#x27;s the one. Just a weapon to be used and then thrown away. reply bgroat 8 hours agoparentprevA founder friend confided in me years ago, \"It is MUCH easier to raise more money than it is to fire someone... I just keep raising and hiring and eventually everything will get done\"No surprise that this approach was very much a \"Low-Rates Phenomenon\" reply user_named 5 hours agorootparentWhy is it hard to fire? I thought it&#x27;s super easy in the US. reply danjac 5 hours agorootparentLegally perhaps, but firing people particularly en mass is hard to do right, unless you don&#x27;t care and you are just prepping for a fire sale.You can lose people who might be key contributors. You can destroy morale in the rest of the company. Everyone else knows they might be next, so they will leave first chance they get. Finally, it signals to the market you are in trouble (hence why a lot of companies are doing it now: better to be just one more company doing layoffs when everyone else is doing it). reply NewJazz 14 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t the pre-IPO &#x2F; pre-acquisition playbook to cut staff lower than the optimum level to show profitability?But I&#x27;m spitballing here, anyone know more about whether Bandcamp was bloated?Bandcamp was shown to be profitable quite recently. Hard to justify slashing staff in half with that in mind. reply theolivenbaum 14 hours agorootparentFrom what I see, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite. It&#x27;s more like we hired all these people because we&#x27;re growing so fast, so please give us money reply heleninboodler 14 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t sound like a powerful negotiating position, though; it sounds like desperation. Why would you do that intentionally? reply jacobr1 13 hours agorootparentIf the top line is also growing fast, and you have a good story on the unit-economic, part of the narrative is that you can eventually reduce costs and increase margin. It is hard from the outside to distinguish between Amazon style \"we are investing all our profits back into R&D so we can take over the world\" and \"We are bloating our team to grow at all costs and don&#x27;t know what levers to pull\" reply lotsofpulp 11 hours agorootparent> It is hard from the outside to distinguish between Amazon style \"we are investing all our profits back into R&D so we can take over the world\" and \"We are bloating our team to grow at all costs and don&#x27;t know what levers to pull\"Considering Amazon was building physical warehouses, buying land, literally delivering to people, executing deployment of AWS which Netflix was famously using, all while being a publicly listed company with audited public financials I think Amazon’s style is easy to distinguish from the outside. reply jeremyjh 10 hours agorootparentIt really doesn&#x27;t sound easy to me to tell this from the outside. What if the R&D investments are all garbage? It is hard to scale an engineering org effectively, it can take off and start building some microservice fortress that never yields any business value if it has the wrong leadership. reply lotsofpulp 10 hours agorootparentBecause they were publicly listed with public financials, you know they were not losing money:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;charts&#x2F;AMZN&#x2F;amazon&#x2F;profit...You also know from using Amazon that they were near flawlessly executing 2 day shipping across the US with prices competitive with Walmart and other successful retailers.They also had a pricing advantage against incumbents due to not having to collect sales tax in all states until 2016.It’s mostly the verifiably not losing money part though so you knew they weren’t overextending, and they were delivering what people wanted. replys1artibartfast 13 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of counter-intuitive pre-IPO behaviors. Another one is to raise a huge amount of cash through unnecessary funding rounds.You would think that massive dilution for no gain would be a bad idea, but there are usually a lot of perverse incentives at play reply ghostbrainalpha 10 hours agorootparentCould you give an example of 1 of the perverse incentives that could cause that? It&#x27;s very interesting. reply s1artibartfast 9 hours agorootparentA lot of the time IPO investors, both public and institutional, value company cash on hand at more than $1 per dollar during an IPO. An extra 500 million in the bank might make the company IPO for a billion dollars more.Peloton is an example of a company that did a huge unnecessary fundraise before IPO. I&#x27;m sure it makes a bunch of numbers and ratios look better on paper. Psychologically, I think it also helps companies lock in evaluation closer to their IPO Target for when people look back at the history of the company.It&#x27;s pretty similar too the idea of inflating employee head count. You can say \"we made $10 million with only 10 employees last year.

This is true for other walks of life, too.I initiated and lead a platform in Financial Service Industry which lead to massive productivity gains. Through standardized processes we could use an inhouse build No Code editor instead of individual app development. Costs went down from 1.5 Mio to sub 10k USD, time to market from 4 1&#x2F;2 month for two dev teams to a couple of hours for a non-developer per app.Reaction: \"Dude, you are destroying careers. We get paid and promoted by budget and head count. We artificially inflate budgets and projects so that we get promoted.\"I was stunned.

The whole business of not-profitable companies growing for years and hiring people on imaginary future money is tech industry magic beans shit. It&#x27;s divorced from the reality of the rest of the world where people have to really work for a living and don&#x27;t get paid our astronomical salaries.I work as a consultant in tech diligence, but previous to that I worked for many many years for small, profitable, Normal Businesses. And the company I work for is a normal business that watches the bottom line and doesn&#x27;t over hire because we have to be profitable. If you go work for a magic bean company that doesn&#x27;t think being a sustainable business matters, you are, unfortunately, part of a ponzi scheme that can fall apart any time. reply jbm 6 hours agorootparentprevI hated my life when I worked at this style of company.When I worked at (a beverage company), one of the unfortunate realities was that the company did not really compete to make their money. The profit at the entity I worked at was completely based on the price of ingredients that was set by a parent company. We could have reduced complexity and improved efficiency by large margins easily, but it didn&#x27;t matter because the parent company would have clawed back a larger share and pumped their profits, while our efforts were of no benefit.In this aimless zombie corporate mode, they hired people without much thought, and everyone was busy looking busy (8 hour meetings were common for \"developers\"). However, if you are doing something for real, people don&#x27;t see any point in helping you out; so even if you really do want to improve things (in my case, I wanted to help the poor souls on 2ch who had to work on the weekend because of poor internal communication that prevented hand-offs), no one wanted to lend a hand.Since profit is not a big deal, and everyone simulates being busy, no winds up in charge, and the inmates run the asylum. If you are the guy in the unimportant job, you suddenly realize it is a bullshit job and are constantly in fear of your job vanishing. Moreover, since you cannot accomplish anything, it is nearly impossible to find a new job when the company inevitably encounters reality. reply gen220 7 hours agorootparentprev> I think about each of the employees impacted by the company&#x27;s reckless behavior.The \"reckless behavior\" in the above quote was not committed by the acquirer, but by whoever was responsible for leading + growing Bandcamp off this cliff.In the same way you want to treat humans like humans, you need to treat businesses like businesses – i.e., if you&#x27;re not making money or growing revenue fast enough to justify hiring the marginal employee, as a hiring manager, you&#x27;re gambling with the prospective hire&#x27;s career in pursuit of a collective gain.If you&#x27;re an employee joining an unprofitable company, this is part of the package and should be really clear in the interviewing&#x2F;onboarding. If it isn&#x27;t, again, the blame falls at the feet of the CEO, ultimately. reply Night_Thastus 15 hours agoprevI&#x27;m really bummed. I love Bandcamp. It&#x27;s the only place I can buy music FROM THE MUSICIAN with very little overhead, and download a high-quality lossless track. Amazon only lets me buy crap-quality MP3s. Apple is opaque about it, putting either lossy AAC or lossless ALAC in the same M4A containers. >:(The only good alternative is Qobuz, which is frustrating to use and charges absolutely massive overhead.But unfortunately it feels like Bandcamp keeps getting screwed over somehow or another. Most people these days want to stream, not to buy and download. :( reply avitous 10 hours agoparentI too loved Bandcamp for its sane approach to acquiring new music; unlike \"most people\" I refuse to use the streaming-only services, and insist upon buying albums and listening to exactly those selections I choose (and I prefer to listen to albums in their entirety, even today).Perhaps I&#x27;m just old and set in my ways, but choices made by others, especially algorithmically generated \"options maximizing my engagement\", hold no attraction for me whatsoever. Losing such freedom of choice would be painful in the extreme. reply pavel_lishin 9 hours agorootparentI also refuse to use streaming services, and prefer to curate my own music - but for me, it&#x27;s less about algorithmic suggestions, and more about actually owning the things I&#x27;ve paid for.A streaming service or an artist can pull music from a service (see Neil Young), but they ain&#x27;t going to be reaching into my hard drives and pulling the mp3s out of it. reply DavidPiper 7 hours agorootparentI am all in on owning things as well. To the point that I&#x27;ll buy Blu-Rays where I can too, rather than sign up for an extra streaming service.With music in particular, I definitely see discovery as a problem though -- particularly these days when \"radio\" isn&#x27;t really a thing (at least for me). Spotify might be able to fill that gap, but I haven&#x27;t really tried yet.I&#x27;m also worried that \"owning digital things\" is going to become harder and harder as time goes on, but I haven&#x27;t quite been able to put my finger on what the tipping point for that is going to be. reply trinsic2 6 hours agorootparentYeah it seems like it&#x27;s going in that direction. The new generation seems fine with streaming services, now. I worked for a few customers who want to retain their physical music in their homes with a media devices and stream it to all their devices in the home. Slowly but surely many home entertainment devices that store music have been slowly removing those features in favor of streaming services. This has been making it very hard for people to retain physical copies of their music without some sort of custom solution that has to be maintained.For me, I refuse to use music streaming services, I rely heavily on my digital music collection most of which comes from Bandcamp. Bandcamp is the last bastion of physical digital music where there is direct interaction between musicians and music lovers. If it dies, we are screwed. If its possible, id actually like to see it be supported from donations like Thunderbird is if it was possible.

DI.FM is different though, its a streaming service, curated by humans (who are the worlds best DJs), has a sustainable buinsess model and lets you download streams.Its very intersting how my music taste has evolved over the years, the more genres and types i was exposed to, the more i discovered. Nothing beats going to a concert you dont know anything about and having the night of your life. Im one for nostalgia, no doubt, but i think listening to the same song, in the same tone, over and over again, is a simplistic view of music and ruines its potential magic. Music and moods are instrinically linked. What happens if i was to listen to my favourite rockband, but instead mixed into chillout music that ebbs and flows over 5 or 10 hours. I get to hear the songs i love, in different ways, evoking different emotions and memories. I find that extends the life of music, not run it into the ground, dulling all those memories that triggered your love in the first place. I kissed that girl for the first time listening to this song, fades if you listen to that song everyday.Spotify is automated radio, warts and all. Popular amoung the consumerist sheeple, often coupled with tv and shopping subscription technoligies. Society has always had this cross section of music interest, chinstroker outlets always existed at fringes, hardly able to survive in the world they helped create. Music sells. Captalists like to sell things people love to buy. A victim of their own success. Such is the harsh reality of this economic system, things just cant be done, they have to be done to death, then revamped and rebranded and the cycle goes on. reply avitous 8 hours agorootparentprevOwnership is indeed the other reason I don&#x27;t do streaming.

The amount of new albums I get to listen to would put a massive dent in my bank account if I was buying them as I go.I still purchase Vinyl and the odd CD, but that is reserved for my top must have records.

Now, they get something every time I listen to their songs.I would, however, enjoy much higher quality audio. Even with the top tier Pandora plan, it&#x27;s still MP3&#x27;s, albeit high quality MP3&#x27;s. reply avitous 8 hours agorootparentI tried a couple streaming services a while back, and them rather annoying.

Especially if the union was planning to negotiate for remote work.Yes, it could be considered retaliation via constructive dismissal without cause. In theory the NLRB could force remediations including but not limited to reinstatement of position (ie, hiring them back). If the NLRB decides that the terminations were intended to break support for recognizing the union, the NLRB has the authority to force automatic recognition without an election.That&#x27;s assuming the union pursues that case, of course, and the whole process takes months. reply stronglikedan 15 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps not, if the union is not yet recognized. reply OkayPhysicist 15 hours agorootparentA union does not need to be recognized for anti-union actions to be illegal.

Fun fact, unless an artist&#x2F;label has explicitly limited what you can listen to without having made a purchase, you can listen to most of the music on Bandcamp in full, without buying it, an unlimited number of times if you&#x27;re not logged in. The way it works is that, if you&#x27;re logged in, you get a set (~3?) number of listens before Bandcamp basically says, \"Yo, you seem to dig this, you should prolly be a mensch and throw some dough to the artist(s)&#x2F;label.\" If you&#x27;re logged out, I&#x27;m not sure what the limit is (if there even is one?), but it&#x27;s likely easily circumvented by clearing cache&#x2F;cookies. reply freeone3000 14 hours agorootparentprevBandcamp let me pay a musician for a song, regardless of how unknown or unpopular a band was.

They&#x27;ve played a major role in drastically reducing any chance of significant revenue flowing to musicians, in complete contrast to Bandcamp.People hearing your music is nice and all (I like it when people hear my stuff on BC), but it is orthogonal to the revenue that used to be associated with making recorded music available. There&#x27;s far, far more music out there than anyone will ever be able to listen to, and I consider the possibility of even 1 paid milkshake for a musician much more important than some random number of listeners who heard the track on Spotify.

It&#x27;s not as simple as that.

I&#x27;m not interested in owning albums, you can stream an album or individual songs.I spent years buying music, ripping the CDs, organizing files, etc. I&#x27;m very glad that I don&#x27;t need to bother any more.

I care about good music. There&#x27;s an incredible amount of good music out there, and it&#x27;s rare that an album is full of it. Your definition of \"good\" may vary, but mine isn&#x27;t really influenced by the artist. Most albums are mostly not-good-music. I&#x27;m picky, and look at unrelated songs independently. This is why I don&#x27;t really care for albums. I feel no debt to a single artist or a nothing-more-than-release-time-related collection of music, which is what most are.Some albums I do considered a complete, single, work, but that&#x27;s relatively rare. Daft Punk - Random Access Memories is a good example, in my opinion.I don&#x27;t see what concerts have to do with anything.

That there’s “a lot” of music on either platform is meaningless if the tools to find things I’d like don’t work for me.I get the compensation model sucks for artists. I try to buy things from bands I like. But ultimately, if artists don’t like the Spotify model, they should pull their music - but I’m going to continue to use a platform that gives me access to everything I’d ever want to hear for like, $10&#x2F;mo. reply vintermann 2 hours agorootparentI think the auto-built playlists are bad. Not only because they slip in something jarring, but even the \"This is...\" playlists can&#x27;t be trusted.

I seriously doubt it. reply vintermann 2 hours agorootparentThis is easy to check. Yes, premium listens are pooled separately from ad-supported listens.If an artist is extremely popular with ad-supported listeners, that doesn&#x27;t let them eat into the pool of payments from premium listeners.Note, however, that listens are pooled by country, not per user. So premium accounts running background music in a hair salon 6 days a week will decide where your subscription money goes far more than the music you listen to.Originally, this was because the big record companies demanded it.

Bandcamp provides an outlet for artists that aren&#x27;t part of the pop music spectrum. I&#x27;m deep into electronic music and Bandcamp is the _only_ place that some artists are even listed, and it&#x27;s become an amazing space for artists that want to release limited press special edition records - pre-ordered by fans to cover the manufacturing price. Prior to this I acquired a few cool records via Kickstarter, but Bandcamp is preferable.Furthermore, Spotify are well known for paying artists next to nothing. Bandcamp are well known for letting artists take the majority of the purchase price of their music.Not to mention, listening to mp3s is for chumps!Bandcamp is the best there is (for now) if you want to financially support the artists you like. I spend a lot of time in record stores (both physical and digital) but they are mostly extinct now. There&#x27;s a few I still frequent: Juno, Boomkat, Hardwax among them, but the more the world turns to services like Spotify, the less room there is for real music stores.It&#x27;s super annoying how the internet kills everything that was good.

The only explanation of the algorithm is what I would expect, rather than some silly humans in the loop: recommendation based on user activity and the analysis of the song style [1].https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;the-sound-of-ai&#x2F;spotifys-discover-weekly-... reply jlarocco 11 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s interesting - I usually don&#x27;t like Spotify&#x27;s recommendations.Youtube was much better at that IMO, but I&#x27;ve tried to stop using it due to the Google connection.I don&#x27;t really know where Bandcamp stands - I&#x27;ve bought music there that I found on YouTube, but haven&#x27;t used it to find new stuff. reply nomel 10 hours agorootparent> I usually don&#x27;t like Spotify&#x27;s recommendationsIt requires that you like songs, and listen, of course. I have around 1600 liked songs. It knows me well enough at this point. reply jlarocco 10 hours agorootparentThat hasn&#x27;t helped any. I have almost 1100 liked songs, several dozen liked albums, and several years of near daily listening. The recommendations are still less good (for me) than what YouTube recommended without an account, just based on my listening history. reply nomel 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been satisfied, but that&#x27;s good to hear. I&#x27;ll give it another try.My biggest problem with the Spotify recommendation is that it seems to be a bit \"sticky\", recommended recent listens more than anything. reply jlarocco 10 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s what I don&#x27;t like about it, also.It seems like it gives me recommendations too similar to what I&#x27;m already listening to. replynkozyra 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d say you&#x27;re very much in the minority then. Spotify is notorious for its weak recommendation system. reply mardifoufs 15 hours agorootparentCompared to what?

Eric Risberg/AP The Microsoft-owned social media platform LinkedIn is laying off nearly 700 employees, it said in a statement Monday. About 668 positions across the company's engineering, product, talent and finance departments will be eliminated. The announcement comes after the company said in May it was laying off 716 employees. LinkedIn said it is restructuring the company and \"streamlining our decision making.\" \"We are committed to providing our full support to all impacted employees during this transition and ensuring that they are treated with care and respect,\" LinkedIn said. Sponsor Message BUSINESS Microsoft slashes 10,000 jobs, the latest in a wave of layoffs In its most recent quarterly report released in July, LinkedIn said its revenue increased 5% year over year and surpassed $15 billion for the first time. Website membership also grew for the past eight quarters to more than 950 million accounts. LinkedIn said in its May layoff announcement that despite revenue and user growth, it has been \"seeing shifts in customer behavior and slower revenue growth.\" In January, Microsoft said it was laying off 10,000 employees to cut costs. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the time the company is \"seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one.\" There have been mass layoffs across the tech industry, including at Amazon, Google and Meta. microsoft linkedin layoffs Facebook Flipboard Email More Stories From NPR ECONOMY The Indicator Quiz: Climate Edition BUSINESS A hotel worker's 3-hour commute tells the story of LA's housing crisis and her strike BUSINESS Criminal mastermind or hapless dude?

    "commentBody": "LinkedIn is laying off nearly 700 employeesHacker NewspastloginLinkedIn is laying off nearly 700 employees (npr.org) 355 points by cebert 15 hours ago| hidepastfavorite302 comments codeTired 14 hours agoHas anyone else noticed that LinkedIn is turning into a shitty social media platform? Memes and videos are now being posted.I used to get decent use from it but stopped updating my profile because the site is cancer. Full of self patting on the back and people adding me to “grow their network”. Recruiters contacting me with “perfect fit” position in languages not on my profile.Can someone please develop hacker news type basic site but for jobs? No memes, no dark patterns, no likes. reply tombert 14 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s extremely frustrating, because in 2023 you&#x27;re sort of expected to have a linkedin (some job applications even require it!), but people have started treating it like the next FaceBook. From 2020-2022 I saw a lot of COVID conspiracy theories and political memes being posted, and I wanted to respond to them, but since LinkedIn is basically a resume, I withheld responding, for the same reason that I don&#x27;t put my voting history directly on my resume.Though honestly the worst part is the \"inspiration porn\" that people post on there all the time, nearly all of which reduce to \"the job market is tough, but don&#x27;t give up because it gets easy!!!\". When you point out that it, in fact, does not ever get \"easy\" to wake up to 30 rejection emails every morning, they either try and sell you on some meditation routine, tell you that you have a bad attitude, or just block you.Honestly, it really is the absolute worst platform that I am stuck using. There are worse websites, obviously, but no one is forcing me to go to 4chan or The Daily Stormer every day. reply 88913527 12 hours agorootparentYou can have a LinkedIn profile but not use the feed-- I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s necessarily frustrating. Make a profile, provide the link on job applications. Occasionally edit your profile so it&#x27;s up to date. Then, don&#x27;t use it. Simple enough. reply jxramos 11 hours agorootparentI wish there was a way to never accidentally click on or navigate to the feed at all on LinkedIn. Could be a good opportunity for a browser extension to just nuke that part of the DOM. reply hyldmo 11 hours agorootparentThat exists already! I use this one, which works on a bunch of other sites as well: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;news-feed-eradicat... reply kevin_thibedeau 8 hours agorootparentprevI recently pointed out to our corporate security that a data broker has detailed employee records for our entire company including job titles and start dates. Given the nature of our business, that data cache is a roadmap for security compromises. The most likely culprit was scraping from LinkedIn. It isn&#x27;t always a good idea to put your data out there for others to aggregate. reply nroach 4 hours agorootparentSome companies supply that information voluntarily. Experian (iirc) even has a product offering that ‘helps employees qualify for loans and demonstrate stable earnings’ if the companies will just only send them payroll history. So it may not have been scraped necessarily, just “shared” in the ordinary course of business. reply tombert 12 hours agorootparentprevSure, but a lot of companies post job listings on LinkedIn as well. I could (and mostly do) ignore the homepage, but I still see it occasionally. reply dangus 9 hours agorootparentprevCoincidentally, this drives everything that is so bad about the platform. All the normal people you know in real life wouldn’t be caught dead posting to LinkedIn, just using it as a resume and jobs platform. The only people willing to post anything are attention seekers and influencers.It’s a similar complaint to how your Facebook and Instagram feeds barely contain the people you follow anymore, which encourages regular people to post less and attention seekers to post more.The business model of ad-supported social media apparently doesn’t work under the paradigm of checking in on your friends for a reasonable amount of time (like 5 minutes a day) and calling it a day. Instead, it’s just optimized to be as much of an addiction as possible, and there’s no way your real respected work colleagues can provide that amount of content. reply ShadowBanThis01 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I basically use it for online resume storage.For years LinkedIn languished as the site everyone was on, but nobody actually used for anything. But I have actually gotten a couple of leads from it now.The feed is trash though, for sure. And you have to laugh at the endless parade of bimbo pictures attached to accounts that are supposedly \"recruiters.\" Unprofessional and insulting. reply ravenstine 8 hours agorootparentSpeaking of \"bimbo\" recruiters, some of them are low key phone-sex operators.I had an experience where one of them reached out to me about a job over the phone. She had a hot-sounding voice and the job seemed intriguing, so I figured I would give it a shot. Her LinkedIn photo was stunning. Yes, I sheepishly admit that I was taken in by her and this influenced my decision to even consider a random job from a recruiter.She was friendly but kinda ditzy, seemed to barely know what she was talking about, and once the easy stuff was over, I was abruptly handed over to some dude. It&#x27;s like... I thought you were my recruiter, so who&#x27;s this other guy? He pretty much handled my recruitment process from that point on, but she was allowed to be the first one to talk to me on each call and get the credit for \"recruiting\" me, although she turned out to be more like live-bait than anything else.IMO, the tactic of many of these recruitment firms is to hire attractive women to fool male programmers into considering otherwise unappealing jobs and direct most of the profit to the male recruiters.Part of me is glad the industry is in such a state that no recruiters are contacting me anymore. 99% of third party recruiters are blood sucking parasites. reply ShadowBanThis01 6 hours agorootparentHahah, wow, I haven&#x27;t engaged with any of them, but that&#x27;s a fun anecdote. Thanks for confirming. reply mauliknshah 13 hours agorootparentprevFurther to that, my feed have been filled with Certification posts. Folks would boast about their 3 hour Certification courses with long cringe posts! And LinkedIn would not stop it, because they need to sell LinkedIn Learning! reply tombert 13 hours agorootparentHonestly, if it were just people bragging about how they took a 3 hour class and got a useless certification, I don&#x27;t think it would bother me. LinkedIn markets itself as a glorified resume, and it&#x27;s pretty common for people to fluff up their meaningless certs.I just feel like there should be somewhat of a boundary between personal and professional life. There are things I would say to my friends that I wouldn&#x27;t tell anyone in charge of giving me money, at least not directly, and I feel like LinkedIn (purposefully or otherwise) is actively trying to erode that boundary. It&#x27;s horrible. reply ghaff 13 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s not much I would post on Facebook that would cause me heartburn if a potential employer were to see it. (And most of my Facebook friends would be profoundly uninterested in most tech topics I would post on.)But, yeah, I keep my LinkedIn--to the degree I use it at all--very anodyne except to the degree you have relatively extreme opinions on specific tech topics. reply tombert 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t have a facebook, but I don&#x27;t think I post anything that&#x27;s likely to get me fired to any social media. However, there&#x27;s sort of a difference between \"not being fired\" and \"being hired\".My political opinions are pretty normal (basically typical American lefty), and if my employer were to find a blog post I wrote about universal healthcare or something it&#x27;s doubtful that they&#x27;d fire me. That&#x27;s a little different than me plastering \"BIDEN 2024!!!\" all over my resume, and that&#x27;s why I utterly hate LinkedIn. reply dadsquad 12 hours agorootparentprevanodyne, great word reply temp0826 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a perfectly cromulent word replyJohnFen 13 hours agorootparentprev> some job applications even require it!I&#x27;ve never encountered this, but if I did, I&#x27;d be pretty thankful for the advance warning that I would not likely enjoy working there. reply winphone1974 11 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s very little correlation between a company that&#x27;s deeply integrated with LinkedIn tools and what it&#x27;s like to work there. If you&#x27;re going to judge all companies based on their recruitment toolchain, good luck finding an acceptable position! reply tombert 12 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t remember where, but it was a fairly typical form where you put your name and information, upload your resume, required fields have a red asterisk, and the LinkedIn profile was required.Now, I have no idea how much parsing they actually did; you might have been able to put \"asdf\" to make it validate. reply jollofricepeas 8 hours agorootparentprevIt has got worse.But there’s a right way to use LinkedIn.Keep in mind that the majority of people only want to network when they need something. You can use LinkedIn to do the opposite and create meaningful connections.1. Judgment-free support. That lady you barely remember from your previous job is starting a business. Encourage her. Some person is starting yet another podcast? Ask a couple of kind questions.2. A low effort contact list. Next time you go out to an event and meet with new people ask to connect on LinkedIn. You have a better chance of maintaining that connection with LinkedIn reminders than if you exchange phone number or email.Why do this? Life is short. reply ssnistfajen 11 hours agorootparentprevI aggressively clicked \"not interested\" on meme&#x2F;fluff posts for a while and now when my LinkedIn page always starts with some sort of system design diagram. My next click is usually straight to the jobs page anyways.The site will be done for once they start putting trending topics in the jobs page. reply walthamstow 11 hours agorootparentThe best is &#x27;unfollow&#x27;. I have a a bit less than a hundred connections, all real people I know, and I follow 0 accounts. So there is no feed. It&#x27;s empty. reply Ms-J 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never had a Linkedin nor any other type of social media, not even a public Github page, and I&#x27;ve received many simply great job offers, especially in 2022-2023.Putting this out there so people don&#x27;t think they need to join some absolutely shit random corporate social networks to get a job. reply o116172854 11 hours agorootparentprev4chan is way better than HN, sorry. reply notjoemama 13 hours agoparentprevIf this adds a humorous twist on it for you, I saw someone describe it as like a dating site except it’s women trying to contact men and men ghosting them. reply paulcrecruiter 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s actually even more funny than this: it&#x27;s beautiful women trying to contact nerdy men and getting ghosted by them :) reply anilmr 12 hours agorootparentlol, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;george-hotz-b3866476&#x2F; - George Hotz of comma.ai uses LinkedIn for dating ;) reply jackbravo 12 hours agorootparentI thought this was a joke, but then he puts it right in his profile:> PLEASE READ PROFILE. While some people use LinkedIn for \"networking\" and advertising their \"personal brand,\" I use this site exclusively as a dating platform. If you are intelligent, attractive, female, in or visiting San Diego, and perhaps a bit out of the norm, I might be interested. Send me a message and invite me out for a drink! (and please make it clear you are asking me on a date) All non-dating related messages will be ignored.But at the same time seems like it is a failed platform for him too:> UPDATE. LinkedIn is too full of faux career climbers and not enough dating opportunity. Follow me on Instagram @georgehotz reply rcpt 10 hours agorootparentOne of the fun things about LinkedIn is figuring ways to filter the auto recruiter messages and his is pretty great tbh.I&#x27;ve been using »FirstName LastName« in my profile and when I get emails addressed to »FirstName I know they&#x27;re from a machine reply ct0 9 hours agorootparenti put a period after my first name, same idea reply alephnerd 11 hours agorootparentprevThat explains why they were asking for Putman scores when hiring engineers around the time they started. reply anilmr 12 hours agorootparentprevhaha, guess LinkedIn didn&#x27;t help him with dating. reply starcraft2wol 8 hours agorootparentprevBesides the joke, I think it can help you sympathize with women in that situation as well, and maybe improve your dating :) You can start to see why lots of attention still feel shollow.Yeah ok, people are sending me jobs... do they even know what I do? This looks automated, they probably send a million? reply about3fitty 8 hours agorootparentFor me, it’s messages like “How’s it going at City and County of San Francisco?” reply itake 7 hours agorootparentprevI know a girl that uses LinkedIn for dating. She lives in Asia, so maybe they have a different LinkedIn culture. reply lobocinza 3 hours agorootparentOr a different dating culture. reply gumby 13 hours agoparentprevYou can just use it in the original way: simply look at profiles, make the occasional requested intro for someone you actually know to someone you actually know, and maintain your resume. I have ignored the drive to turn it into a social network and it pretty much works the same as it did when it started.For example, when I have a meeting with someone I always look them up on LI first, to see if we have something in common. reply winphone1974 11 hours agorootparentI agree! I think it&#x27;s actually easier to avoid the big, weak network because it started as a professional tool. I curate my connections and don&#x27;t accept every recruiter or sales person who sees it as yet another marketing channel. It&#x27;s been invaluable for reaching out to my former coworkers to try and recruit them reply johnnyanmac 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not very subtle. I watched a 2 minute clip of 5 men working together to save a dog from a river. And that was loosely connected to a generic post about how team work is effective. Sometime in the last 5 years LinkedIn just became a slightly more formal variant of FB&#x2F;Instagram.>Can someone please develop hacker news type basic site but for jobsHN does have a job board: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;jobsAnd monthly there is a \"Who&#x27;s hiring\" and \"Who wants to be hired\" thread automatically posted.Nothing for my domain there but I check it a few times a year. reply yumraj 12 hours agorootparent> HN does have a job board:That’s not a generic job board. It’s only for YC companies. reply johnnyanmac 12 hours agorootparentYeah, the linked job board is only for YC. The monthly threads are generic, though. And decently active. reply gowld 11 hours agorootparentprevIf that&#x27;s the video of the construction-worker looking guys pulling the dog from a canal-looking waterway, that video was awesome. reply spacemadness 13 hours agoparentprevIt’s been like this for many years now. I can’t really remember it otherwise. I’ve lost respect for some colleagues after seeing all the self congratulatory posting that exaggerates what happened and long-winded work stories on their profiles. I’m done with giving folks a pass at this stage on their Linkedin ladder climbing nonsense. Like most social media it’s a giant circlejerk just with a white collar lean. reply DoesntMatter22 13 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s even worse than that. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of crazy political discussions there where people, fully identifiable, are just losing their minds, saying racist stuff even.I have no idea why people would be willing to risk their jobs like that but I see people from Fortune 50 companies doing it. Crazy reply spacemadness 13 hours agorootparentThat is something. I stopped reading it entirely sometime last year but don’t recall the crazy uncle effect. What was mentioned sounded similar to what I experienced, including the memes—-but I didn’t realize it was sinking so low in becoming Reddit on a bad day without the anonymity. reply DoesntMatter22 11 hours agorootparentLiterally it was worse than almost anything I&#x27;ve seen on reddit.Idk if they put a stop to it or not but it was madness reply abawany 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd reporting blatant garbage always results in &#x27;we don&#x27;t think there is a problem here&#x27; response from LI. reply ricardobayes 23 minutes agoparentprevFor me the last nail in the coffin was showing unfiltered images of human remains - from the latest middle eastern conflict. No trigger warning, no NSFW filter, nothing. That&#x27;s unacceptable. reply onlyrealcuzzo 13 hours agoparentprev> Has anyone else noticed that LinkedIn is turning into a shitty social media platform? Memes and videos are now being posted.It&#x27;s also gotten pretty political.If I cared about your political hot takes - I&#x27;d be on Facebook.Though this seems to be permeating everywhere, even to HN - even though the mods try their best to keep it out. reply mrbonner 14 hours agoparentprevYeah mine news feed has turned into a condescending stream of thoughts buried under the empathy offering agendas. reply pydry 14 hours agorootparentOr this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d2u3dcdbebyaiu.cloudfront.net&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;atch_img&#x2F;442&#x2F;f... reply DaiPlusPlus 13 hours agorootparentIs there a name for the specific kind of moderate-level of mental anguish I felt when reading that? reply f1shy 13 hours agorootparentIn german and spanish there is an expression for shaming for others.

Take the explanation for why Keysight Technologies is called Keysight Technologies:&#x27;The name Keysight is built from two English words: key, meaning indispensable or essential, a means of access; and insight, meaning the power of seeing, having vision and perception. The name connotes seeing what others cannot, having the critical or key insight to understand and unlock the changing technology landscape.Keysight reflects what&#x27;s in our DNA, what we strive to provide to our customers - the key measurement insights engineers need to accelerate innovation and ultimately achieve success - whether they see success as being first to market, increasing their differentiation, ramping up production, or achieving lower costs of test within a rapidly changing technology landscape.According to Ron, the name Keysight \"captures the spirit of our new company - innovative, insightful, and forward-looking, with the special kind of vision to sort through the rapid technological revolutions and anticipate customers&#x27; needs so they stay one step ahead.\"&#x27;[0]So I&#x27;d say all bets are off.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keysight.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;keys&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;keysight-and-... reply mrbonner 6 hours agorootparentI also don&#x27;t see anything wrong or cringe with the explanation. reply CamperBob2 10 hours agorootparentprevEh, I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with that. You have to rename the company. \"Agilent\" and and \"Hewlett Packard\" are taken. So you pick a name and make up some marketing fluff to justify it.\"Keysight\" sounds like \"key insight,\" which is what you get from decent test equipment. They could have done much worse. reply castlecrasher2 12 hours agorootparentprevPoe&#x27;s Law strikes again reply wayfinder 13 hours agoparentprevWell most people see LinkedIn as a central place to store resumes.Being everyone’s free storage unit does not generally make money.So they have to turn the resume storage part into a loss leader and turn a profit some other way. Being a place to list job postings is the most obvious but they have competition already.Throwing on ads will make money but LinkedIn isn’t a site most people stick around on. Turning LinkedIn into a social media site keeps people on the site so the ads work, but it’s a pretty ugly way to do it. The type of people who are actually going to use LinkedIn like Facebook is probably the worst kind of people you want sticking around too.LinkedIn could have stayed a small site with a small team but they got started by getting money from investors. Now they have other people to answer too. reply ghaff 13 hours agorootparent>Well most people see LinkedIn as a central place to store resumes.Or as a self-updating Rolodex of which there were quite a few at one point.

For example, blocking Gary Vee almost single-handedly made my LinkedIn feed usable again. I never followed him or any of his pages to begin with, but enough of my connections embarrassingly engage with those kinds of posts that it cluttered everything up. Go to the source and pull out the root of the problem.re: politics, there are one or two LinkedIn entities that post the most mildly progressive of content, and it&#x27;s the knuckle-draggers in the comments that made me block these pages. reply marcod 13 hours agorootparentprevTell me one area that has not gotten more political or partisan in recent years. reply DiggyJohnson 13 hours agorootparentI actually tried to think of one and struggled…I host a weekly open-mic at a local bar (mostly music but some standup and poetry) and more and more often I’ve had to figure out how to gracefully handle a performer using some of their 6-10 minutes to share their not-as-popular-as-they-might think political takes or commentary.And it should be handled gracefully, because I’m not in the business of banning political content from the contents of poetry or standup or lyrics or whatever.

I was convinced LinkedIn would eat Xing&#x27;s lunch when they launched in Germany, since the same happened pretty fast to Facebook and its local clone (StudiVZ). However, it hasn&#x27;t happened then and only now some small tendency for people to prefer LinkedIn can be noticed, but mostly because of international contacts and not because the site is all that great.Anyway, in the last couple of years, Xing also mutated from a business contact network to a wanna-be Facebook social network, with memes, neurotic posting, outreach metrics etc. Instead of being a contact backbone, it&#x27;s become an attention leech, basically the same experience as you describe for LinkedIn. At least in case of Xing, it&#x27;s more or less known that they have been infested by product managers for a long time, whose only metric for success has ever been \"innovation (tm)\", so it&#x27;s explainable, but still stupid. I suppose same could be happening at LinkedIn, even though they never have been good to begin with, palatable at most. reply btgeekboy 14 hours agoparentprevThere are monthly who’s hiring and who wants to be hired threads that seem to fill that niche. reply codeTired 14 hours agorootparentUnfortunately my tech stack isn’t very popular with HN, SQL&#x2F;C#.

It pretends to offer something to you, the individual. Yet you are not paying for the site, so you are part of the product not the customer. The real customers are companies (advertising) and recruiters (self-described raw meat to be had). However, linkedIn seems to have messed up with that business model as well. Because recruiters wants recruits - not just a mailing list of people who are not interested. This leaves only the advertisers, thus turning even more recruits from visiting the site, therefore making the site less interesting to recruiters. A downward spiral, really. Recent offerings of linkedin Learning seems to be attempts to mitigate this but at the core of the problem really is that the site offers very little value to recruits. Maybe there are some smart business model people around that could fix that, who knows. The space is ready for dis-ruption. reply pseudotrash 12 hours agoparentprevThe recruiter spam and self promoting content from people who talk like they got 3 mortgages and 4 ex-spouses or ... -the opposite- absolute silence and disdain of a crowd that never posts these thoughts under their real name (and rant on HN or twitter instead speaking their truth on LinkedIn) has always been deafening.In the age of Musk&#x27;s twitter it is somewhat peculiar that LinkedIn ended up as the last social media platform where interesting posts can be discovered provided you don&#x27;t \"blind-follow\" and follow the right people. None of this will work for those who expect it to work as some kind of magic garden where recruiters will present only what is relevant to you.

That term implies that these MBAs were somehow blindsided by the imminent recession that analysts have talked about as far back as 2020 and that this wasn&#x27;t an intentional strategy to maximize growth while labor was \"cheap\" (or at least, the money to hire labor).This was all calculated and most companies still came out of this larger than when they entered the pandemic. It was all calculated and workers were nothing more than expendable pawns. Not much we can do about it without stronger labor laws, but that&#x27;s a multi-decade battle. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentprevIt seems to me that \"we overhired and need to fix that\" is a message that would make things easier for those laid off.

If the latter, is there some way to automate the moderation (to make it scalable to LinkedIn-sized networks)?I&#x27;m also thinking of Quora, which was once an amazing community, but eventually (though it took years) degraded into just another meme-fest&#x2F;click-bait social network. reply nlh 13 hours agoparentI think it’s an intrinsic byproduct of any site&#x2F;community that puts an algorithmic feed optimized for “engagement” front and center.

Whatever Facebook did around 2015 or so to make everything bloated, animated reactions, and slower seemed to make things more user-friendly for a subset of less technical users, such that people who can&#x27;t fact-check obviously fake articles and spam posts are enabled and incentivized to post as much as possible, and adding algorithms on top of that to maximize \"engagement\" make these things inevitable.Twitter&#x27;s chronological got turned off as the default at some point for a similar algorithmic \"for you\" page that I think has also made things worse for their platforms.No idea about Quora, but eventually for ad-supported sites you start maximizing for time on the site and getting people to look at ads, rather than \"quality\" in the content on your social media site. reply thephyber 11 hours agoparentprevThe fact that YCombinator doesn’t need to optimize the platform for profit&#x2F;advertising for the business to continue to run profitably means they can afford to maintain rules which encourage only niche high quality discussions and keep high standards for moderation. reply low_tech_love 12 hours agoparentprevHN engagement is not (for now?) directly related to any significant \"real-world\" metric, meaning that (for now?) people are not using it as an indicator in a CV or anything like that. Having a lot of points here also does not lead (at least as far as I know) to any significant \"real-world\" social engagement between its users. As soon as such a score exists, human beings will start to optimize it in some ridiculous and disgusting ways.I also suspect that moderation is heavy, but I have absolutely no idea about how it works, who does it, etc. I&#x27;ve never seen moderators engaging with the community here, which means that probably moderating itself does not add to your social score. reply thephyber 11 hours agorootparentdang is very active with moderation on HN.You will frequently see the top comment is by him when he describes merging &#x2F; redirecting threads, explain title changes, or try to set expectations for hot&#x2F;contentious topics. reply RockyMcNuts 8 hours agoparentprevadverse selection, a community is good, so it grows, and then it becomes attractive to the mainstream, and to bad actors who exploit it for their own agendas, and extract value while making it worse. reply Barrin92 13 hours agoparentprevit&#x27;s both.

Tests indicate that the active ingredient in Roundup may be interacting with the area's hard water to cause epidemic levels of chronic kidney disease. Credit: Jake Ulrich For the past couple of decades, tens of thousands of people living in rural Sri Lanka have been devastated by kidney failure due to unclear causes, also known as CKDu. Similar incidences of mysterious kidney diseases have emerged in tropical farming communities around the world. A massive field study of the wells supplying drinking water to the Sri Lankan communities, conducted by researchers at Duke University, has identified a possible culprit—glyphosate, the active compound in Roundup, the most widely used herbicide in the world. The results of the study were published in Environmental Science and Technology Letters on September 13, 2023. Roundup is a glyphosate-based herbicide used to control weeds and other pests. Because it is supposed to break down in the environment within a few days to weeks, its use is relatively under-regulated by most public health agencies. But when glyphosate encounters certain trace metal ions that make water hard—like magnesium and calcium—glyphosate-metal ion complexes can form. Those complexes can persist up to seven years in water and 22 years in soil. \"It was always thought that this chemical would break down very quickly in the environment, but it seems to stick around a lot longer than we expected when it complexes in hard water,\" said Nishad Jayasundara, the Juli Plant Grainger Assistant Professor of Global Environmental Health at Duke. \"We have to consider how glyphosate is interacting with these other elements, and what happens to glyphosate when you take that into your body as a complex.\" In certain agricultural areas of Sri Lanka, the high, dry climate combined with its geological formations creates the perfect conditions for hard water. It is also in these regions that CKDu has reached epidemic levels, with as many as 10% of children aged 5–11 years exhibiting signs of early onset kidney damage. Jayasundara, who is from Sri Lanka himself, believed that glyphosate may play a role in CKDu incidence because of the region's hard water, even though Sri Lanka has banned use of the herbicide. To test his hypothesis, Jayasundara teamed up with environmental chemist Lee Ferguson, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Duke and his Ph.D. student Jake Ulrich. In collaboration with Mangala De Silva, a professor at the University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka, the Duke team sampled more than 200 wells across four regions in Sri Lanka. Ferguson's lab at Duke employs high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry to identify contaminants—even the barest trace of them—by their molecular weights. It's a highly sensitive method of identification and quantitation that allows a broad view into the pollutants present in a water system. Through this technique, the researchers found significantly higher levels of the herbicide in 44% of wells within the affected areas versus just 8% of those outside it. \"We really focused on drinking water here, but it's possible there are other important routes of exposure—direct contact from agricultural workers spraying the pesticide, or perhaps food or dust,\" said Ferguson. \"I'd like to see increased study with more emphasis looking at the links among these exposure routes. It still seems like there might be things we're missing.\" To this point, Ulrich also found elevated levels of fluoride and vanadium—both of which are linked to kidney damage—in the drinking water of most all of the communities with high incidence of CKDu. The researchers agree that more attention must be paid to the potential contributions each of these contaminants is playing, either individually or in concert with others. But given the reasoning for their glyphosate-based hypothesis going into the study and the herbicide's high levels of use worldwide, they also believe these results should serve as a serious warning when considering risk of exposure to glyphosate. Part of Ferguson's concern, he said, is that glyphosate's fate profile resembles a contaminant that he's studied closer to home—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are also called \"forever chemicals\" because of their persistence in the environment. \"We think of PFAS as being a drinking water contaminant because it's mobile and persistent. Now we're realizing that glyphosate may also be quite persistent in hard water areas,\" said Ferguson. \"This gives me concerns about exposures here in the United States.\" More information: Jake C.

Its use in agriculture and gardening has been proclaimed safe because humans and other animals do not have the target enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). However, increasing numbers of studies have demonstrated risks to humans and animals because the shikimate metabolic pathway is present in many microbes. Here, we assess the potential effect of glyphosate on healthy human microbiota. Our results demonstrate that more than one-half of human microbiome are intrinsically sensitive to glyphosate. However, further empirical studies are needed to determine the effect of glyphosate on healthy human microbiota....4. ConclusionsHence, does glyphosate affect the human microbiota? Contemporary research points to the herbicide’s potential to disrupt healthy microbiomes, including the human microbiome. Several empirical studies have determined the impact of glyphosate-based products on wild- and host-associated microbiota and called to control the potentially negative consequences on environmental health and sustainability. However, further empirical studies are needed to find a “smoking gun” that determines the effect of glyphosate on the healthy human microbiota. Moreover, additional experimental and epidemiological studies are needed to determine these proposed effects of glyphosate-based products on wild and host-associated microbes to control their potentially negative consequences on human health and ecosystem functions and services.\"Other:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?q=human+microbiome+glypho... reply undersuit 9 hours agorootparentprevYou may call it a weed, I call it my garden. reply cvccvroomvroom 9 hours agorootparentprevWould you drink it? reply bumby 8 hours agorootparentThis is a pretty bad standard to judge toxicity, unless you’re diluting it to relevant dosages reply Incipient 6 hours agorootparentprevYou wouldn&#x27;t drink hypersaline water either, but that doesn&#x27;t mean salt is bad for you. reply diogenes4 7 hours agorootparentprevOh man i had no idea we could enumerate the totality of chemical effects in the human body, my b reply jimnotgym 11 hours agoparentprevThings are often not black and white.Farmers used to plough fields after harvest. This kills weeds. It also uses a lot of power, so burns a lot of diesel and releases CO2. Ploughing also allows carbon trapped in organic material in the soil to break down and releases yet more CO2 as well as destroying soil structure.Low&#x2F;no till farming seeds directly into last year&#x27;s stubble. This uses much less diesel so releases much less CO2. Organic matter in the soil builds up, trapping more carbon, and improving soil health. But now the weeds grow unchecked and destroy the crop.A common variation of the above low till method it to &#x27;cultivate&#x27; (sort of scuff up) the surface of the soil after harvest. This causes weeds to germinate. Then you spray them with glyphosate (Roundup), and can almost immediately start sowing your crop. This allows you to farm with much less carbon released, lower fertilizer usage (also reducing carbon).Roundup allows farming with lower inputs and better soil health and less carbon released.

If you plot grain yields over time compared to herbicide use over time and fertilizer use over time, you can see one thing quite clearly. The use of synthetic inputs, along with plant breeding and genetic engineering, has saved humanity from starvation and allowed unhindered growth.Any experienced agriculturalist knows this. Any experienced commodity trader knows this. All this talk about commercial farming needing to be eradicated is fantasy talk. There are trade-offs to everything.When you consider cost&#x2F;acre and calories&#x2F;acre, it is also abundantly clear that for all its flaws, modern industrial farming is a technological marvel.When you look back into the history of herbicides, you can consider glyphosate to be way better than many of the past options. So things are definitely getting better.As for the demonization of glyphosate, I would say that most of this literature is just provocative headlines for the sake of grant funding. It&#x27;s very trendy to claim that glyphosate is causing X,Y, and Z.

Why do we have to pick abundant calories or nutritious food? This is a false choice. In the short term, it is a tradeoff given a particular set of technological and economic constraints.Over the medium and long-term, the constraints change.If people were wiser, {technological development, economics, and policy} could have led us to a better place.Perhaps one with a better mix of agricultural offerings: a range of calorie dense & nutrient dense & combinations of both. All at prices that people are willing to pay, which of course depends on subsidies, earning power, and personal values.Forgive me, but I’m going to preempt one kind of knee-jerk response someone might feel they need to write next: I’m describing a range of possible future outcomes, not a particular political philosophy.Remember, my point is to reject the false choice. The tiresome (but classic) “next move” for someone would be to move the goalposts and criticize some particular policy they think I’m recommending. I’m not recommending a particular policy.

If you do not have this in your water, you can safely skip. High iron can lead to iron reducing bacteria scumming up fixtures and, more importantly, rapidly dissolving a hot water heater tank. If you smell sulfur in your hot water when you shower on a well, that bacteria is eating up your tank&#x27;s anode rod quicker than normally would (I also suggest a powered anode rod, good for 20+ years to keep a tank tip top vs having to replace consumable anode rods, but that is another topic). A three cartridge system will cost you a few hundred dollars for setup, replacing the cartridges roughly every year after ~100k gallons of water has passed through them (~$100-200&#x2F;year, depending on cartridge filter selection). You can mix and match cartridges for your specific water contaminant filtering needs (sediment, iron, heavy metals, VOCs, pesticides, etc).

Fluoride in drinking water covers this need also but (arguably) brings along small risks of symptoms of slight excess fluoride consumption.The amounts that are actually put in drinking water do not seem to have any significant negative effects, and it seems reasonably clear that the population positive effects dominate, but being non-consensually subjected to a marginal risk of negative effect in order to achieve a positive outcome for the population is exactly the kind of thing that reliably provokes this kind of reaction from the paranoid libertarian set. reply ipaddr 12 hours agorootparentThey have studied it and it does cause issues.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;34597567&#x2F;#:~:text=Excess%20a.... reply chiefalchemist 12 hours agorootparentprevIf you look at these CDC pages:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;fluoridation&#x2F;index.htmlhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;fluoridation&#x2F;basics&#x2F;cost.htmYou&#x27;ll notice one key thing is missing: Side by side comparison with communities that don&#x27;t have fluoride in their water.

The authors are hypothesising a quite long pathway from glyphosate in a country with a ban to water contamination to glyphosate-metal complex to kidney disease.

It’s not exactly easy to keep a massive long-term shilling operation secret when journalists would be chomping at the bit for a “Monsanto shill army proven” story and be willing to pay for proof.At this point I’m utterly convinced that Monsanto doesn’t hire any shills and instead just does straightforwards propaganda work where they just convince people with slanted studied that they push to the top of Google search that sway people with reasonable sounding arguments (roundup makes food cheap!) and just wait for them to parrot these arguments and then for them to be accused of shilling making Monsanto’s opponents look unhinged. As evidenced by the plenty of actual evidence that they promote pro-roundup research and the plenty of actual evidence that they advertise stores that make roundup sound more safe.Do you realize how self-sustaining contrarianism is when people consistently feed the contrarians ego by consistently, and wrongly, accusing them of being shills? Irrespective of who is right or wrong on the broader issue, the people accused of being shills are right that they aren’t shills so it’s basically a dopamine slam dunk to just side with Monsanto and have people line up to give a blatantly wrong opinion (that you are a shill).

Twice a year I have to dig the frickn roots&#x2F;shoots out of my yard. reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agorootparentprevwhat do they have against clover? they sound uptight reply mvdtnz 13 hours agorootparentClover invades garden beds. It will choke out an edible garden and destroy the aesthetics of an ornamental garden. It will prevent seedlings from thriving. There is absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting clover to invade your garden beds. reply Waterluvian 12 hours agorootparentBeyond that, they don’t need a reason at all. Imposing one’s beliefs and opinions on a neighbour is the kind of intellectually stunted behaviour that we’re struggling with as a species. replyolyjohn 12 hours agoparentprevDandelions taste gross though. That&#x27;s why nobody wants to eat them.Also, grass is native in a lot of places. reply isk517 12 hours agoparentprevIf you live in North America the common dandelion is actually an invasive species. reply lotsofpulp 13 hours agoparentprevGlyphosate would kill lawns too. reply SoftTalker 13 hours agorootparentYes Roundup will kill your whole lawn, if you apply it to your whole lawn. It will also spot-kill weeds if you apply it just to the weeds. You&#x27;ll be left with a little dead patch that you can re-seed after a week or so.I gave up on having a beautiful weed-free lawn a long time ago. The cost and time it takes to keep one is just not a good value for me. So whatever grows, grows. I mow it every couple of weeks. reply LesZedCB 13 hours agorootparentprevI just searched for \"remove weeds from lawn\" and while they do admirably suggest manual removal methods first, the last resort measures are indeed chemical herbicides, including specifically glyphosate reply Waterluvian 13 hours agorootparentFWIW I have a pristine play lawn without any herbicides. The trick I found was to foster growth of really dense, healthy grass. Theres nowhere for weeds to establish so I have to hand-pick a few dozen in a year.My favourite is this creeping Charlie vine. It’s so satisfying to get an end up and just gently pull like eight feet of it off mine and my neighbour’s lawn. reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agorootparentprevthat would be an insane last resort, because it would just kill the grass. you&#x27;d be better off at that point to just rototil it in and start over reply sokoloff 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s commonly used in a renovation situation: fertilize and water well in early August to get everything growing, then hit it with two applications of glyphosate spaced about 2 weeks apart to kill everything, then scalp it as low as you reasonably can and seed with quality seed of whatever variety&#x2F;varieties of grass you want to grow.If you believe glyphosate is relatively harmless (as compared to a series of 6-10 applications of selective herbicides to achieve not quite as good as the same end result), it&#x27;s easy to understand why people are inclined to declare bankruptcy on their mess of a lawn and start fresh. Applying it in August, you could have a high-quality uniform lawn by October. (If it&#x27;s far from harmless, then the series of selective treatments might be better.)Rototilling to start over just surfaces a bunch of latent weed seeds that are in the top few inches of soil always. To start over, you want to kill everything growing without disturbing the soil and surfacing the weed seeds. reply bluGill 9 hours agorootparentprevRototill is much worse for the environment. You have all the CO2 released from the effort. Plus bare ground that will erode away in wind or rain. Then you have all the organic matter in the soil you destory.Or a little round up and plant grass seed over the top. Much less CO2, and the soil and organic matter stay in place. reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agoparentprevpeople don&#x27;t spray glyphosate on their lawns. it&#x27;s a systemic non-specific herbicide that will kill your grass (or any other plant)you might be thinking of dicamba or 2,4d which are much worse for the environment (and probably for you) and target broadleaf plants only (e.g. dandelions)glyphosate is most used for cash crop farming, large quantities sprayed on \"roundup ready\" corn and soy that has been engineered to be immune to it reply baq 13 hours agorootparentAlso used for dessication (…is that a word…?): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cropscience.bayer.co.uk&#x2F;roundup-hub&#x2F;roundup-use-pre-... reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agorootparentYeah, though there are other contact herbicides that tend to work better for that.Definitely \"mini\" or \"new\" potatoes is where this happens a lot. Kill the plant before full maturity so that the tuber stops growing and accumulates starches, then harvest. The potato farms near me do it, it&#x27;s kinda gross. reply DoreenMichele 12 hours agoprevRoundup is a glyphosate-based herbicide used to control weeds and other pests. Because it is supposed to break down in the environment within a few days to weeks, its use is relatively under-regulated by most public health agencies. But when glyphosate encounters certain trace metal ions that make water hard—like magnesium and calcium—glyphosate-metal ion complexes can form. Those complexes can persist up to seven years in water and 22 years in soil.Similarly: International aid groups dug wells in Pakistan to alleviate sickness from contaminated surface waters, such as rain water collection. It was successful and dramatically reduced incidence of illness and death from that cause.It also led to widespread arsenic poisoning from many of the wells.Actually improving things is tough and even if you succeed, people will focus primarily on any unintended and undesirable consequences. People almost never mention that the wells in Pakistan achieved the intended goal and I full well expect to be met with open hostility and accusations of some sort (apologist, downplaying).There may well be good reasons to not be more even handed in presenting such info. Or there may not be.When we start with a presumption of guilt and looking for someone to blame for presumed intentional malice, it frequently interferes with moving towards solutions. Even if you can find someone to blame and successfully indict, it typically doesn&#x27;t fix the problem.Few people focus on fixing the problem and trying to discuss solutions is often met with vastly more hostility than finger pointing. reply stevev 13 hours agoprevNow try the US.

    "originBody": "Hey, HN! We&#x27;re James and Cyriel, co-founders of Radical. We&#x27;re making an autonomous solar-powered aircraft designed for continuous flight in the stratosphere. Our 20 ft. prototype recently flew nonstop for over 24 hours, which you can see in this video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;E6oDxQYEksc (edit—warning, there are rapidly flashing lights starting just after 1m, in case you&#x27;re sensitive to that). Our website is at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.radicalaero.com&#x2F;, but it&#x27;s pretty bare. If you use LinkedIn, we have a few more posts at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;radicalaero.Our aircraft is designed to fly over specific areas for months, carrying various payloads for tasks like imagery, sensing, and telecommunications. What we’re building behaves like a drone in some ways, and like a satellite in other ways. Much like satellites, we’re able to provide service for long periods of time, but we’re also much closer to users (we fly at around 20 km altitude) and able to maneuver or remain over an area of interest. This makes what we’re building really well suited to applications that require continuous coverage or high-resolution&#x2F;bandwidth data.Examples of this include continuous real-time monitoring (such as in wildfire management or illegal fishing), high-resolution mapping and imagery (we’re able to collect sub-10 cm resolution imagery), and high-speed direct-to-device internet. The ability to permanently host sensors and devices in the sky in this way opens the door to lots of new opportunities. In truth, we still don’t know all the new applications that will arise from this (we’re really interested to hear your thoughts on potential applications!).As for the technical details: Our aircraft is battery electric and driven by propellers. It has a large wing for high aerodynamic efficiency and to generate the necessary lift required to fly in the thin air of the stratosphere. The wing is covered in solar cells, during the day, these power the aircraft and charge its batteries. Through the night, battery energy is deployed to continue flight. We repeat this process daily, enabling us to fly for up to a year without needing to land. Ultimately, battery cycle life is what limits our aircraft’s flight endurance - and we can land, carry out simple maintenance tasks and then re-launch to continue flying. Our aircraft has multiple tails which help to stabilize the ultra-lightweight structure (our 20 ft. prototype weighs just 13 lbs.). We also use these tails to control the aircraft, they provide roll control by twisting the main wing of the aircraft, increasing or decreasing lift as needed.The aircraft is fully autonomous; it has a full autopilot system onboard and various sensors for position, airspeed, and other key data streams (much like a typical drone or UAS). The aircraft flies at high altitudes of around 70,000 ft. (20 km) avoiding cloud cover, civil air traffic, and the turbulent winds of the troposphere.Long endurance flight has been the goal of many past projects. NASA’s Helios and the DARPA Vulture program tried to develop long endurance aircraft. Helios’s crash led to an overhaul of aircraft structural analysis codes, and DARPA Vulture led to advancements in battery and solar tech. More recently, both Facebook’s Aquila and Google’s Loon were discontinued. Recent advancements in battery and solar tech, and miniaturization of electronics mean long endurance flight is now feasible - but we are aware we need to do things differently to succeed. Unlike those before us, we’re not tying ourselves to a single application and are focused on bringing a cost-effective solution to market. That means avoiding research-grade components and moving quickly. Additionally, we firmly believe that iterating to a solution will allow us to continue making progress where others have stalled and lost momentum. We’ve seen this before in hard tech where companies like SpaceX and Helion Energy have made rapid progress against difficult problems.We approach our technology with an iterative design philosophy - we’ll keep building and learning as we go. We use-off-the-shelf components, iterate quickly, and design for easy assembly to keep costs low. For example, from clean sheet to flight, we designed, built, and flew our 20 ft. aircraft in less than two months. After our first flights, we prepared our 24-hour-capable prototype in two weeks, which successfully completed its non-stop 24-hour flight on first launch. Having proved our core technologies at a smaller scale, we’re now moving onto bigger things. Our next goal is to fly a full-scale 110 ft. wingspan aircraft in the stratosphere next year!Both of us have Masters degrees in Aerospace Engineering and we then spent 6 years working together on delivery drones at Amazon Prime Air. Whilst the application is very different - we’ve found our knowledge of drone and robotics hardware to be invaluable so far with Radical. By using readily available components, learning through iteration, and designing an aircraft that is easy to assemble, we can keep the cost of our aircraft low and address many markets that weren’t feasible before.We’re really excited about the technology we’re developing, it&#x27;s a challenging physics problem that pushes the boundaries of what is possible. Super excited to share this with you and to hear your thoughts and comments!",

I&#x27;ve been pretty obsessed with this idea for a while — here&#x27;s an analysis I did a few years back: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;gusgordon&#x2F;atmospheric_satelliteI got a minimum wingspan of around 8m for self-sustaining flight on the winter solstice with a small payload — pretty close to what you all built.The biggest problem I ran into when creating this analysis was accurately estimating solar irradiance at different altitudes.

Estimating air mass and solar irradiance are definitely interesting topics - I&#x27;ll take a look at what you&#x27;ve put together! reply Gasp0de 32 minutes agoprevAre you using thermals to stay in the air?

I mostly make 16 lb canoes, but have lots of extra machine time.

That is, using the solar power in daytime to climb higher and glide lower during night time? reply Patrick_CTY 1 hour agoprevThis is super impressive! Would love to be considered for your future rounds. Our firm has the supply chain resources that companies like DJI are leveraging in Shenzhen, China. Shoot me an email at tianyi.cheng@shixiangcap.com reply philipkglass 17 hours agoprevVery interesting! This sounds a lot like the more recent iterations of the Airbus Zephyr: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Airbus_ZephyrI don&#x27;t know how much you can share, but I&#x27;m curious about the solar and battery system.Are you using silicon cells, multi-junction cells, or something else?What sort of battery chemistry do you use? It seems like deep battery cycling is a must to keep weight under control, but battery degradation is probably the limiting factor for mission duration. The low temperature in the stratosphere also seems more challenging than what terrestrial vehicles deal with. reply jthomaslm 16 hours agoparentYes, Airbus’s project and team is very cool! What we’re doing shares similarities with Zephyr, but we’re focusing on a lower cost system, and a larger payload which will enable more use cases.We’re using conventional silicon solar cells, rather than the GaAs cells used by Airbus. We give up some efficiency by doing this, but it keeps costs far lower - which we think is key to iterating quickly, and opening up some of the market use cases.Similarly, we’re sticking with conventional battery chemistries (Lithium Ion). Battery energy density is by far the biggest driver for this technology - in the past decade we’ve seen huge advancements in battery tech, which is one of the reasons this technology is now possible. As you identify, cycle life is a key challenge and what will limit the aircraft’s endurance. reply simfoo 6 hours agorootparent> we’re focusing on a lower cost system, and a larger payload which will enable more use cases.So you want to beat Airbus but also be cheaper. And do it with off-the-shelf components too, because those specialized ones are just too expensive.

But lets not kid ourselves. reply nine_k 8 hours agorootparentBasically any technology that makes any difference will have a military value, and will be used by the military.One of the few things that are not obviously, if in any way at all, usable for any military purposes is targeted advertising.

Targeted advertising appears to be a valuable tool in encouraging young people to join the military. reply jthomaslm 15 hours agoparentprevWildland forest fires were actually the inspiration for this technology! A year ago Seattle had the worst air quality in the world for a few days, which piqued my interest in the area. Speaking to people in the USFS we learned about the challenges of getting real-time high-resolution data, and realized that an ultra long endurance drone would be a great way to get this. reply 1024core 8 hours agorootparentYou know what would be really helpful in such a use case? Thermal imaging. Now I&#x27;ll admit I know nothing about Thermal Imaging, but I imagine if it was possible to get a live high resolution thermal image of an area, you could identify hotspots quickly. Heck, even for SAR missions, being able to thermal image a large area and look for warm bodies may be very useful.Of course I have no idea if this is feasible or not, but I assume someone here will correct me if I&#x27;m pipe-dreaming. reply Juicyy 4 hours agorootparentits very feasible with satellites and drones run by DARPA or USAF. Even helicopters use IR and \"night vision\". the sensing systems are expensive reply CaveTech 14 hours agorootparentprevAny idea how big an effect air quality has on cell efficiency? Do cells work with diffuse light or is 20km high enough to be unaffected? reply jthomaslm 13 hours agorootparentFlying at 20 km should place us above cloud cover and fire smoke, but the cells do work surprisingly well in diffuse light.

Is it launched from a separate vehicle? reply jthomaslm 15 hours agoparentThe aircraft is able to climb under its own power. We have a diurnal energy cycle - charging the battery up through the day and deploying battery energy in the night. If we launch in the morning with a full battery, we have a whole day&#x27;s worth of extra solar power to use to climb up to altitude.Winds will be a bigger issue than energy when climbing. Up at 20 km (70k ft.) winds are quite calm, but we need to ascend through more turbulent winds as we climb. We’re sizing our MVP around this. reply rolling_robot 14 hours agorootparentWinds up to 20 km are NOT quite calm. They can max out to 60 m&#x2F;s at height of 10 km, which is more than 3 times than enough to blow a solar aircraft far-far away. You have to choose proper meteo conditions for climbing and descending and plan the trajectory taking into account those winds to be able to land at a given place. I&#x27;ve been analyzing GFS data a couple of years ago for similar project. The problem is that lack of energy demands to design a really low speed aircraft for low densities that you can find in stratosphere. At 10 km winds are stronger than in stratosphere and density is higer. You can find the results in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;eprint&#x2F;GVXWXDABPE6A8PNRGTBU&#x2F;ful....

The transition from zero knots to the stall speed of the aircraft (minimum speed at which it can remain airborne) is the tricky bit. Designing for a lower stall speed necessitates wings which produce higher drag (by being larger) which requires more propulsion, which means bigger batteries and motors. So launching from a catapult or rocket or mothership or whatever means a lighter plane. reply hermitcrab 14 hours agorootparentLaunching by rocket means the plane would have to be pretty rugged to survive it.

There wasn&#x27;t another autonomous plane, so it was the first to do what it was trying to do. That wasn&#x27;t really my field, but I know it was truly painful to get FAA approval for lots of things. They were really concerned with some autonomous plane flying over cities, so most of our long flights avoided flying over populations. That was pretty easy in CONUS, but flying into Germany for the Euro Hawk was super painful apparently. There isn&#x27;t exactly un-populated areas around there. Regarding voice, yes there was someone in the ground station on comms, and to any other airplane, they appeared to be coming from the aircraft and not the ground. Altitude makes a lot of things easier, plus the military has a lot of restricted airspace. I honestly have no idea how a civilian autonomous aircraft will pull it off. I&#x27;m sure a lot has changed in 20-ish years, so maybe it is not a painful now. With the FAA, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll still be a headache. reply the__alchemist 15 hours agoprevLooks amazing!

My goodness. reply jthomaslm 12 hours agoparentprevLove the enthusiasm - it&#x27;s definitely a very fun project to be working on!Discussed a few of your questions elsewhere in the comments, but here are some thoughts on scaling laws:Over-simplifying a bit for the sake of brevity: In general, for larger aircraft structural mass scales up more quickly than wing area (check out “indoor free flight models”). By using a span-loaded structure (i.e. having weight distributed along the wing span to match the way lift is spread over the wing) you can avoid some of these constraints and have an approximately constant structural mass fraction.The aircraft is actually very quiet - it needs to be very aerodynamically efficient so it doesn&#x27;t require much thrust. You can’t really hear it in flight, but I’m no audio engineer - so I don&#x27;t know how useful microphones would be. Genuinely curious about this so if you have any pointers let me know! reply hermitcrab 17 hours agoprevWas the 24 hour test at 20km? Doesn&#x27;t it take a lot of battery power to climb to that height?>we then spent 6 years working together on delivery drones at Amazon Prime AirWas that ever a serious endeavour or just a publicity stunt? reply jthomaslm 17 hours agoparentThe 24 hour test was with a sub-scale prototype at low altitudes. It turns out that testing a small aircraft in the thicker air at these altitudes matches some important physics of the larger aircraft (Reynolds number).Perhaps unexpectedly, climbing to 20km altitude isn’t too large a problem from an energy perspective. In a typical energy cycle, the aircraft has low battery in the morning, so if we launch with a full battery charge we have plenty of extra energy to climb up to altitude.Prime Air - definitely a serious project, but I’m sure Amazon didn’t hesitate in milking the PR! Making a reliable drone delivery service at Amazon scales certainly isn’t easy. That team is still going strong and I’m sure we’ll see more from them as they ramp up commercial deliveries. reply hermitcrab 16 hours agorootparent>The 24 hour test was with a sub-scale prototype at low altitudes.That&#x27;s fine, but I think you need to make that clear or some people might think you aren&#x27;t being straight. reply frontiersummit 16 hours agorootparentprevJust over 20 years ago, a small model aircraft (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Spirit_of_Butts%27_Farm) crossed the Atlantic in 39 hours using about a gallon of Naptha as fuel. The same year, the Design-Build-Fly club at my university built an electric aircraft which had some serious endurance and payload capabilities, though I don&#x27;t remember the details. Keeping a model electric plane aloft for a day is impressive, but how many hobbyists have built something similar by now without any expectation of VC money? reply hermitcrab 14 hours agorootparentImpressive.

I suspect that most of the previous projects failed because of these issues combined with tight requirements on very light-weight structures. reply t0mas88 13 hours agoparentIndeed. Very high aspect ratio wings could be hard to make strong enough at very low weight to survive climbing through the lower parts of the atmosphere.Some convective activity could help the climb, but it would add a lot of turbulence for the first 30,000ft or so. reply f6v 16 hours agoprevLooks cool!

To retain enough battery capacity, heating elements are required. The same is true for other onboard electronics.Interestingly, because the stratosphere’s air is so thin, heat generated by the aircraft isn’t lost as fast to the surrounding air as at sea-level.As mentioned by th0mas88, humidity is pretty low and icing typically doesn’t occur at these altitudes. reply t0mas88 13 hours agoparentprevIcing doesn&#x27;t happen below about -40 C because moisture in the air at those temperatures becomes ice crystals which don&#x27;t freeze to aircraft.

One big one is that our aircraft isn’t in orbit, so it’s much easier for us to provide targeted coverage over a specific area without needing a full constellation. Flying at 20 km also puts us much closer to users which makes high-speed direct-to-device service (5G) a lot easier.In terms of coverage, from that altitude, we have good line of sight coverage over large areas. Obviously, satellites can cover wider areas, but it turns out that in most suburban&#x2F;rural settings the ground footprint becomes limited by the population density and bandwidth available - so the larger satellite footprint is only really useful in extremely remote locations. reply siliconsorcerer 17 hours agoprevVery cool idea. As far as applications, I love the idea of this being a lower cost &#x2F; higher resolution version of satellite imaging, think Ororatec, Planet, Spire etc. reply jthomaslm 12 hours agoparentAbsolutely, we think there are some really interesting use cases around imagery too - for exactly these reasons. reply jshreder 16 hours agoprevI LOVE this -- I&#x27;ve nearly pulled the trigger on solar drone builds in the past, this is everything I wanted and more.Amazing work!

How does this differ from SkyDweller? reply jthomaslm 11 hours agoparentOur aim is to fly at higher altitudes than Solar Impulse&#x2F;SkyDweller, which keeps us above the turbulent winds and cloud cover of the troposphere, and makes long endurance flight more reliable&#x2F;less weather dependent. Our platform is also a lot smaller than SkyDweller, which helps keep costs much lower and opens some interesting new opportunities - for example, deploying lots of aircraft in a mesh network.The Solar Impulse&#x2F;SkyDweller lineage is very inspiring - what an amazing way to demonstrate how much you can do with solar power! reply randomh3r0 15 hours agoprevI used to work on a platform like this and loved the challenges.

Most race tracks can just use regular signals but this track is huge and wraps around a mountain, so you’d need either thousands of repeaters or the aircraft they currently use.You guys should try and see if they could use your tech, it seems a perfect fit and might be good fit for marketing for both sides. reply jthomaslm 13 hours agoparentWow, very cool!

Assuming you have a working concept, you don&#x27;t really need the funding for scaling up, and the network is barely adjacent at best. I&#x27;m just curious about the benefits that I don&#x27;t see. reply stevage 13 hours agoprevSo it sounds like a great platform for spying and surveillance... reply creyes12345 17 hours agoprevI was peripherally involved with a similar project a few years ago. They got bought out by Facebook. This was before Aquila.There’s a good reason why most airplanes look and behave alike: because it works. Technology choices like flying wings (not used here) or twisting wings (used here) are a “code smell” to my computer programmer nose. To me, nothing is sexier than good reliable technology that works. Smart investors will know that. The other ones will do you a favor by staying away.The use of batteries to maintain altitude at night is a big concern. Batteries are heavy and will dramatically cut down on the usable payload. They need to be maintained warm (but not too warm!), which is a challenge at the low ambient temperatures the aircraft will experience while flying.Most airplane accidents happen during take-off and landing. Please do not shortchange these phases of flight, and good luck. reply cyrieln 13 hours agoparentLow weight and high aerodynamic efficiency are crucial. You naturally end up with high aspect-ratio wings which tend to be more flexible than conventional aircraft wings. In order to keep aero-elastic effects under control, multiple tailplanes can help to stabilize the structure, and provide roll control at the same time - we’re not set on this technology though, ultimately our analysis tooling will drive this design decision.Batteries are heavy, but if you want to conduct long endurance flights - greater than a few days, then realistically they are the best option. reply actinium226 16 hours agoparentprevTo be fair, the Wright Flyer used twisting wings. Ailerons took over, but it&#x27;s not like twisting wings are some low TRL thing. reply creyes12345 16 hours agorootparentThe Wright brothers were incredible engineers, and a twisting wing made sense for their design. For high efficiency, a stiff wing is a must. Nowadays active stability systems make more designs practical. But the mission goals here favor low weight and reliability. reply BWStearns 16 hours agorootparentprevAlso the Wright bros’ litigiousness over their IP was a main driver of the effective extinction of wing warping and the rise of ailerons rather than strictly engineering concerns. I imagine with newer materials wing warping could be pretty effective. reply razeh 8 hours agoparentprevWhat are the alternatives to batteries if you want to fly through the night? reply gxs 9 hours agoprevWhile this isn’t in my wheel house, if you think it would be valuable I am happy to connect you with a friend who runs a battery as a service startup - they have connections to vendors etc.He was previously a founder of a solar company and knows the ins and outs of batteries.If interested, shoot me your info and I can make the introduction. reply ada1981 13 hours agoprevCongrats!We’ve got a group with other visionary founders &#x2F; Unicorn founders that might be great to have you a part of.A@175g.com is my personal email. reply actinium226 16 hours agoprevJust wanted to comment to wish you guys luck. There are some bizarre comments here about use of the aircraft for defense purposes (as if that&#x27;s a bad thing) or the \"ethics\" of surveillance, which applies equally to any surveillance technology, there&#x27;s no reason to single out this platform.I do wonder about the payload capacity, it seems like it might be quite small given the batteries and the limited performance available from the altitude. reply dylanhassinger 15 hours agoprevpanopticon . com reply bglazer 17 hours agoprevDo you have any ethical concerns about the use of your technology for surveillance of civilian populations?That’s the obvious use case for this technology, right? Cheaper and more easily retargetable than satellites. Longer duration, quieter, and more resilient than manned aircraft, but not fast or maneuverable enough to survive in contested airspace.So that leaves large area, long term surveillance in uncontested conditions as the prime use case.Sounds an awful lot like cops or an occupying force putting a fleet of these up to indefinitely track all movement or signals over entire neighborhoods or cities. Do you plan to market and sell your technology for this use? reply jthomaslm 15 hours agoparentThis is a concern for us. As with many disruptive technical advancements (e.g. in Nuclear or AI), there are many ways our technology can be used - both good and bad. It&#x27;s important to us that what we do is ethical - that means supporting and pursuing use cases with huge positive societal value like rural connectivity or wildfire monitoring. With that said, there are definitely ethically-questionable use cases for this technology and I don’t underestimate how difficult it will be to navigate. We certainly have no intention of monitoring civilian populations and haven’t spoken to any police forces about what we’re doing. reply bglazer 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m glad to hear that, I hope you stick to those principles if the police or military come calling. They have deep pockets and your investors will want their 100x. reply nosequel 15 hours agorootparentMaking their plane military-approved would be extremely costly and frankly it probably wouldn&#x27;t work. There have been a lot of people commenting about the military clearly wanting this and taking over the project, but what makes a plane like this possible is not having the same requirements as military aircraft.My biggest concern would be weight & power. This plane only works if it stays light and doesn&#x27;t use a lot of power. If the military wanted this for live video or EO&#x2F;IR, how would that communicate with ground sensors? KU satcom, UHF? Will it have IFF onboard, will it meet all the no-single-point-of-failure requirements? Everything the military requires will start using up a ton of power and adding a ton of weight. I get people always think these things will be used for evil, but it isn&#x27;t exactly easy to take something civilian and suddenly ship it off to some USAF squadron. reply burkaman 16 hours agoparentprevI agree that&#x27;s the most obvious use case, so I think the fact that the founders consciously avoided mentioning it means they must have ethical concerns, or at least understand others&#x27; concerns. I think this is a reasonable question to ask, and I&#x27;d be interested to hear whether they plan to sell it to surveillors and just feel guilty about admitting that, or if there&#x27;s some reason they think this won&#x27;t work for that application. reply Tepix 16 hours agoparentprevExcellent question, this sounds like an enabling technology for mass surveillance on a much larger scale.

No, can&#x27;t use cheap MANPADs for this.My gut feeling tells me this airplane is potentially cheaper than a rocket, so if it is shot down, it is a win already. If it detects launcher position while rocket is on the way it is even bigger win. Potentially it reveals larger radar position too, that&#x27;s another win.It is difficult, expensive and risky to jamm objects at that altitude. In the current Ukraine-Russia war russians would probably not bother jamming it.So, what these guys are developing certainly is a military technology. No way around this. High endurance, high altitude cheap aircraft will sell like hot cakes. reply uoaei 17 hours agoprevSo YC is getting into defense contracting now? reply uoaei 15 hours agoparentFascinating reaction.

Ultimately, someone is going to figure out how to use this to run advertisements in the sky, day and night.Then as technology becomes even more reliable, rich people with remote cabins&#x2F;small remote towns are going to start buying these planes to supply internet to them. Ultimately, if successful, you will start to see these everywhere in the sky.The end result, the sky, the commons of humanity will be polluted by devices that only a small rich minority will benefit from, but the cost will be borne collectively by everyone in society. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Detroit wants to be the first big American city to tax land value If you tax blight, will you get less of it? Do you see the cat?image: getty images Oct 5th 2023DETROIT Share F rom the vantage point of a new apartment on the 33rd floor of the Book Tower, a stunning 1920s Italian-Renaissance-style skyscraper in downtown Detroit, two aspects of the city are visible. Look south-east, towards Canada, and you see a skyline thick with cranes. New towers are shooting up, old ones being rebuilt, and the pavements below are thick with pedestrians. Cross to the other bedroom, however, and you get quite a different view. Right up to the edge of a highway entire city blocks are occupied by nothing but tarmac. At 11am an ocean of surface parking is uninterrupted by even a single car. Just over a decade ago Detroit became the biggest American city to go bankrupt. Since then its city centre has made a remarkable recovery. The Book Tower, which was completely derelict in 2009, has been rebuilt at a cost of over $300m by Bedrock, a property firm owned by Dan Gilbert, Michigan’s richest man. Yet though downtown is humming, huge parts of the city remain blighted. Already have an account? Log in Get the full story Enjoy a month of insightful analysis for free.

His idea is among other things that a property tax discourages investment - one way to make money as an investor is to hold a plot of empty land in a desirable city centre location, watch it go up in value, and neither pay tax on any development on it nor bother with messy things such as tenants. Taxing the land value, according to George, removes that perverse incentive.For a more detailed overview, I recommend Lars Doucet&#x27;s review of George&#x27;s Progress and Poverty, which won the Astral Codex Ten book review contest a year ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.astralcodexten.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;your-book-review-progress-a...I really like the style, but you need to put an hour or so aside to read the whole thing.

So, you can build the Taj Mahal or leave the lot a burned out wreck-- either way you pay the same tax. Many comments on the thread overstate what this is.I happen to think it&#x27;s interesting, but for reasons unrelated to the article-- it&#x27;s kinda goofy for the state to tax personal property that happens to be fixed to a location, like a fireplace, stained glass window or chandelier. Tax a house on a foundation; no tax for a house on wheels? This \"LVT\" scheme does away with those issues so folks can fix whatever they want to the location, so it makes more sense logically even if the connection to Detroit&#x27;s problems is very unclear. reply zip1234 8 hours agorootparentDetroit has blight. LVT addresses property speculators that buy land to sit on it for 10 years and do nothing with it. With LVT they have to either pay up, develop it, or sell it. All options good for the city. reply onlyrealcuzzo 8 hours agorootparentThey should implement a blight tax or a vacant land tax instead.I don&#x27;t see how this helps Detroit&#x27;s problems - unless they arbitrarily set high values on land where land is possibly already worthless. The areas with the most blight have the lowest land values already.The city already owns 75k out of 380k lots (~20% of the city - most of it vacant) - and instead of trying to sell the lots - the Detroit Land Bank holds onto them to arbitrarily inflate land values.This seems like another recipe for a negative feedback loop that makes bad areas even worse.Just tax blight outright.Give away the damn land to anyone that will build something on it and live there - or get someone else to live there, pay taxes, and be a valuable part of the community - rather than a vacant lot that&#x27;s a breeding ground for crime. reply kaibee 7 hours agorootparent> They should implement a blight tax or a vacant land tax instead.A land value tax is a much more elegant solution. For one, it doesn&#x27;t introduce the problem of needing to define &#x27;vacant land&#x27;.

At worst, it&#x27;ll be a political tool for local government to drive out whoever they want by overvaluing plots on purpose.A lot of the land around Detroit is nearly worthless given the blight. Will it be taxed at $0 or will they say that in an alternate universe someone could build a skyscraper there so it&#x27;s worth millions? Even though nobody would actually fund that work.Taxing based on sale price isn&#x27;t perfect, but at least it is much harder to game since it&#x27;s based on a concrete market-clearing price that isn&#x27;t up for debate. reply piaste 2 hours agorootparentWhile it&#x27;s not trivial, assessing un-improved land value does not seem too different from other complicated accounting tasks that both governments and private organisations have been performing for a long time.

The elegant way out is to have the person owning the land self-assess its value, set the LVT at x% of that value, and be legally bound to sell it to anyone who comes up to them offering that price.Now how do we determine that x%? That&#x27;s a good question. I think there&#x27;s no way out of some empiricism even if someone did try this approach. But you can always start it low and raise it incrementally to see how it affects the land economy of an area. reply robertlagrant 22 minutes agorootparent> and be legally bound to sell it to anyone who comes up to them offering that priceWhy? This just seems to create yet another perverse incentive structure that people have to invest time into understanding (and some into exploiting), rather than adding any actual value.

You make a table and there is an entry for \"parcel of land with grass taller than 6 inches and containing one or more 1980s automobile with 3 or more tires\" right alongside \"parking lot\" or \"hospital\". reply chongli 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think tax law fears complexityOf course it does. Complexity in the tax law is regressive. It lets wealthier people and businesses take advantage of more deductions and writeoffs to lower their tax burden, due to the ability to hire accountants full time to work on it. Simple taxes that are difficult to avoid (such as LVT) are best if you want a progressive tax regime.One of the best features of LVT is that it taxes unearned increases in the value of land. While you can do any improvements you want to the property without increasing the LVT, improvements made by the city or other private interests to the area around your land absolutely will increase its value, thus increasing your tax burden. reply eru 4 hours agorootparentSimpler is not only less regressive, but also more efficient. Those lawyers and accountants freed up by simplicity can then go on to contribute to the economy in meaningful ways. reply jjav 3 hours agorootparentprev> Simple taxes that are difficult to avoid (such as LVT)Can you explain how is it simple? Who gets to set the theoretical value of a plot of land, disconnected from all current uses? Since it&#x27;s theoretical, it&#x27;s very subjective. Who do we give this power to make or destroy the owners based on purely subjective speculation on what it might be worth? How do we guarantee that this entity won&#x27;t abuse the power to set arbitrary tax valuations? reply reaperman 2 hours agorootparent> How do we guarantee that this entity won&#x27;t abuse the power to set arbitrary tax valuations?We don&#x27;t. They already do that with \"normal\" property taxes. This wouldn&#x27;t change that.Soon-to-be gentrified neighborhoods are often ignored by property tax assessors and code enforcement for many years, then one day a developer reaches out to the tax assessors and says \"hey the taxable assessment values in this neighborhood should really be higher\". Then the people living there have taxes raised 10-20% every year until they are forced to sell for low prices because they can&#x27;t afford to hold onto their property until the gentrification is actually well underway when they&#x27;d finally see their property value actually go up.At least, that&#x27;s how it goes in Texas.I don&#x27;t think this system would be worse in that sense, probably roughly equivalent. But it makes sense to at least attempt to tax undeveloped and under-developed land at high enough rates to encourage at least some healthy amount of development.

If you are using land by living on it, and want to live on it because it&#x27;s near your friends, family, community, place of work etc, then the value of that land to someone else doesn&#x27;t really matter. Maybe when you die and pass it to your kids, it would be great if it was valuable. But in the mean time (which for most people is many decades), an increase in value only really means an increase in monthly outgoings with no financial benefit to you.Perhaps that&#x27;s the point - in order for cities to stay dynamic and fair, we need to make everyone pay something close to market value for their land - even those who bought it a long time ago. But doing so is unlikely to make those people very happy. reply chongli 17 minutes agorootparentYou can’t make everyone happy all the time.

Land Value Taxation is a concept with a history going back to the Gilded Age when someone realized that NY&#x27;s prosperity was in fact related to its higher levels of homelessness, and that that was due to the land rents that were free-riding on the economic production of the urban area, as they do to this day. reply developer93 19 minutes agorootparentI didn&#x27;t completely understand that, could you elaborate or rephrase maybe with an example? If you have time. Sounds interesting. reply snapplebobapple 6 hours agorootparentprevyour first paragraph applies pretty much equally to taxing land+developments. Also, in the context of a city building to the maximum of the zoning is a good thing in nearly all instances because higher density means you need less land to provide shelter for the inhabitants and it&#x27;s way, way easier to provide most services to higher density. reply flagrant_taco 6 hours agorootparentProperty taxes that factor in existing improvements doesn&#x27;t leave the owner as far behind chasing potential value that they are already being taxed for. When your tax burden is a factor of expected market value of the land plus permanent improvements they&#x27;re taxing you on what you already have. When it&#x27;s based on an expected optimal value of the lad they&#x27;re taxing you on what *they* think your land *should* be worth if fully developed.Assuming that higher density is always better ignores the externalities required to maintain such a system. Higher density cities require more outside inputs brought in from outside the city. Those inputs strip resources from other lands, require input to process the raw materials, and require fuel and vehicles to transport the goods into the city frequently. The city&#x27;s waste must be transported and processed somewhere, again adding impacts to the environment even if those impacts aren&#x27;t directly felt within city limits.If the goal is to minimize impact, cities would only be as large and as dense as they can reasonably be self sufficient. That doesn&#x27;t preclude trade between cities, states, and countries, but it does mean the city isn&#x27;t entirely dependent on a constant churn of bringing in resources from elsewhere and shipping out waste. reply snapplebobapple 5 hours agorootparentLast two paragraphs first: You are making a logic error here. A human at a certain level of (whatever you want to call it, productivity, success, wealth, whatever) will want a certain lifestyle level and will use vastly more resources to achieve that lifestyle in a less dense city. You can see that comparing pretty much any set of cities in the world if you stratify by income and look at resource usage&#x2F;co2 output&#x2F;whatever. Environmental cost of importing resources is also pretty low as long as you have good transportation methods in use (i.e. shipping or train with trucks minimized). So, if you actually want minimize impact the correct thing to do is to expand and densify cities until the decrease in environmental damage per capita from increasing density equals the increase in environmental damage from importing resources. This means the best setup is a dense city with a decent resource feeder area around it, not a self sufficient area with a less dense&#x2F;more suburban city.Now for the first paragraph: This is kind of the point because maximizing use generally means more density, which means more opportunity to minimize use elsewhere. I did outline one situation that I thought was unfair and should be addressed, which is the situation where you buy land zoned one way with a much lower value only to have it zoned another way on you that makes it a lot more valuable. Other than that specific situation, I don&#x27;t agree with you that your first paragraph is a problem, it&#x27;s a positive feature. reply InspiredIdiot 5 hours agorootparentprev> Higher density cities require more outside inputs brought in from outside the city.Surely, it can&#x27;t possibly be that simple. Sometimes that&#x27;s true, sometimes it is not. If I want fiber to my house in the country I might be paying $30k to get that line all the way to my one house whether I want 100MB&#x2F;sec or 10GB&#x2F;sec.

Modern central sewage system only exist because of dense cities, they weren&#x27;t needed before that.High speed internet is purely a convenience and really shouldn&#x27;t be a concern if there&#x27;s any meaningful environmental impact from it. Police and fire similarly are conveniences that may turn into necessities in highs density areas. I live in a rural area where police may show up tomorrow if I call them now and our fire is mostly volunteer.I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone having real issues from either.

To put it very simply: when you buy a thing you spend money and gain value. No change in books. Then after some time you sell said thing for generally less and experience sharp loss. Think of P&L report of a public company. Such maneuver will artificially increase profits during ownership and deflate, potentially up to incurring book loss, them in period of sale. Depreciation&#x2F;amortization simply spreads this loss of value over the period of ownership. Tax implications are mostly incidental and come from reporting. reply nprateem 2 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s because the &#x27;value&#x27; of something (eg a machine) is &#x27;used up&#x27; over time until eg the machine eventually wears out and needs replacing.Depreciation reflects that the asset&#x27;s value is used up over time by allowing the owner to deduct part of its value each period to reflect the reduction in asset value in their financial statements. reply Neil44 2 hours agorootparentprevI wish they would do that here.

Land is cheap and taxes would remain low.For suburban areas, there would be a moderate shift in tax burden. People with homes on large plots of land would pay more; people with homes on smaller plots of land would pay less.For urban areas, the changes would be drastic. Because land is limited in urban cores and appreciates in value every year, there&#x27;s an absurd amount of speculation. An LVT would discourage this by making it costly to hold onto undeveloped or underdeveloped land just for future price gains. As a result, we could expect a surge in the development of vacant or underutilized plots, leading to a potential increase in housing availability and a decrease in rental prices. This would both alleviate housing shortages and reduce the speculative bubbles that can distort urban real estate markets. reply oneshtein 2 hours agorootparentWith %100 LVT, city will be owner of most land in 1 year.

If you use a periodic market-based auction system (the only known way that could possibly yield accurate prices), then you give the government and the wealthy extraordinary power to kick people out of their residences, even ones in which the tenants built the house. Good for the collective perhaps, but terrible for individual autonomy. This could be mitigated by auctioning off longer length (~say 30 year) leases, but you can end up with huge value mismatches after 30 years of change, just like today, and I suspect there would be other unintended consequences. For example, things wouldn&#x27;t be built to last, they&#x27;d be built to generate as much value as possible before the lease is auctioned off again.And even then, you haven&#x27;t really determined what the land is worth, since any rational auction participant is considering how much money can be made with the existing improvements on the property.That being said, I hope they do try it in Detroit, since I have no stake in the city and it seems like it has more to gain than to lose from such an experiment. reply konschubert 1 hour agorootparentYou have the same problem with property taxes, no?Usually that is solved by various measure to slow down the tax increases for existing homeowners - which can be good or bad, depending on whether you&#x27;re a homeowner or somebody looking for a home. reply gr__or 1 hour agorootparentprevImplementation is also the only aspect that makes me question LVT, otherwise I&#x27;m pretty much sold (not an unimportant aspect it is).Wrt \"even ones in which the tenants built the house\": For me the baseline of implementing LVT is that ppl don&#x27;t have to pay it for their primary housing (or a much lowered version of it). Is that controversial? reply ses1984 9 hours agorootparentprevDon’t improvements in nearby plots change the value of a plot of land? reply josnyder 9 hours agorootparentYes, by design. One major goal is to prevent a landowner from squatting on an empty lot while their neighbors build prosperity around it. The \"squatter\" then cashes in, having done nothing themselves. \"Everyone works but the empty lot\" is the commonly used phrase.The goal of an LVT is to insulate a landowner&#x27;s tax bill from being affected by their own improvements. Its anti-goal is to insulate a landowner from changes in land use around them. reply Gigachad 9 hours agorootparentAnother benefit is that it encourages more efficient use of land. Existing taxes mean that if you demolish a high density retail strip and replace it with a McDonald’s or Walmart with large parking lot&#x2F;drive thru, the tax income plummets while the cost to maintain the roads and plumbing remains the same. reply eru 8 hours agorootparentJust to be clear: land value taxes by themselves don&#x27;t encourage more efficient use of land. Removing taxes on improvements (and on capital and labour) encourages more efficient use of land, and a land value tax can help finance those other tax reductions. reply ses1984 3 hours agorootparentprevIt’s just strange phrasing that improvements increase the value of adjacent land but not the land they’re on. reply TulliusCicero 9 hours agorootparentprevTrue enough.

This sounds like a way for investors to build big things and not increase their tax bill. reply epistasis 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a very important question to ask: how big should the investor&#x27;s bill be? For labor, for durable goods, for energy, etc., the investor pays in proportion to what they have taken from others.But what has the investor taken from the public when they build? The best possible answer, in my opinion, is the value of the land they occupy. This exclusive use of a portion of land deprived all others from using it. That is the value of the land, and there are roughly two sources of that value: proximity to all the other things that others have built, or access to natural resources. And importantly, the investor is not the source of that land value, that comes from society as a whole or from nature.So that&#x27;s why the land value is an appropriate object of taxation: it&#x27;s a payment to us all for what we have been deprived of. A person who builds a massive structure of great value on a piece of land has built that structure, but they didn&#x27;t build the land or the bounty that the land provides. reply lbarrow 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, that&#x27;s exactly the idea. We have a problem in the US where many metro areas do not have enough housing, in part because building big things is penalized by the tax code.

This creates prosperity for all those business owners and employees who provide services to maintain and improve their homes, provide them with groceries and entertainment and restaurants and pharmacies. The provision of good transit increases the land value close to its stations; the provision of a highway to higher paying jobs increases the land value close to its exits.The provision of good emergency services and hospitals and libraries and other amenities raises the land values within their service areas. (They don&#x27;t raise the value of the buildings.) reply gnopgnip 8 hours agoparentprevExisting tax policies focus on the current market value of the land. Compared to a land value tax, existing tax policies under assess poorly used land or vacant land and the owners pay much less in taxes. This encourages speculation and discourages productive use.The assessor can&#x27;t the change the share of land vs structure unfairly any more than they can increase the assessed value unfairly. A homeowner can protest the assessment and provide comparable sales and other estimates that show a more objective split of value.Michigan property taxes are interesting in another way, they have had issues with \"dark store\" restrictive covenants for commercial and industrial real estate. Basically the owner of a large commercial building argues the land&#x2F;building has very little value on the open market, it is a single use building with restrictive covenants that prevent an alternative use. These restrictive covenants prevent the land from being sold to their main competitors, and these restrictive covenants are self imposed. reply somethoughts 9 hours agoparentprevAgreed - the many counties in the US already have a portion of the property tax bill coming from a land value tax&#x2F;Georgianism.California property tax bills have two components [1][2]:- structure&#x2F;improvement assessed value- land value assessed valueThe land value component is re-accessed frequently and changes based on comparables (presumably but its mostly black box).The question is to what degree&#x2F;portion of Georgianism to apply and what to do when the land value component starts going up infinitely that its starts hurting the electorate.Do you introduce alternative tax sources (i.e. income)?

Welfare for the well-off is not an efficient use of funds.> - Do you introduce alternative tax sources (i.e. increase income taxes on billionaires instead as in California)?If you do that, you lower your land value tax take.

In fact, for people who haven&#x27;t already bought a home, the cost under a Georgist system are almost exactly the same as before:The yearly outlay for owning a place is the same, because market forces will adjust land prices to make it so.

Even if a homeowner couldn’t keep up with the land tax, they’d be much more likely to be able to find housing in the same area.Compare to right now, where every generation can’t afford to live in their own hometown, because there’s only upwards pressure on housing costs, so families and support networks are constantly being torn apart. reply somethoughts 7 hours agorootparentYes - I think pure Georgism works if you don&#x27;t have zoning restrictions and abundant flat land and slow linear growth.OR you have proper planning and build it into the city charter. The city needs to have planned for the locations of future additional schools&#x2F;recreational infrastructure&#x2F;transporation a priori and have sufficient resources (water, gas, electricity, sewage).There also need to be proper addendums to any purchase agreements to highlight the potential for severe property tax increases.Post facto switchovers to or continuation of pure LVT don&#x27;t seem like they would work realistically. reply KptMarchewa 8 hours agorootparentprevProper, non prop 13 land value tax limits this infinite value growth. reply somethoughts 8 hours agorootparentAgree - I think pure land value&#x2F;pure Georgism works best when there are no limits on development (zoning&#x2F;water availability&#x2F;topography) and there&#x27;s room for infinite sprawl into adjacent flat land.As mentioned I think Texas will be interesting to watch as its pretty close pure Georgianism - the state&#x27;s revenue is mostly&#x2F;all LVT property taxes - but they are starting to see exponential growth - so it will be interesting to see if they stick to it or resort to California style Prop 13. reply yumbaya 7 hours agorootparentprevTexas is not Georgist. Property tax is assessed on the full market value of property, not on land. And Texas’s land speculation and sprawling, inefficient land use reflects this. reply somethoughts 6 hours agorootparentAgreed - its not pure Georgism. It is however the closest experiment to Georgism in the US as far as I can tell having looked at their tax revenue sources (mostly property taxes with some petroleum production tax and no income tax) and the fact that they will attempt to increase the property taxes to market value on an empty lot.

They come up with that assessment by assessing the land value, and the structure value, and adding them together. But they are still taxing improvements at the same rate as the land. Sure, land value can rise and become a greater portion of the total market value. But this is still conventional property taxation.In a pure LVT system the structure should play no part. The landowner should be free to build whatever they want on their land without such building causing a change to their taxes. A partial step towards LVT would be a “split rate” system, where the value of the land is taxed at a higher rate, say 5%, than the value of the structures, which could be 0.5%.Pennsylvania is the example case here in the US:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;non-glamorous-g... reply bostonvaulter2 5 hours agorootparentprevI thought Philadelphia was closer to a LVT? reply gnopgnip 8 hours agorootparentprevThe economy is not a zero sum game.

Just an increase (even a substantial one) is way less alarming. replyLVTfan 8 hours agorootparentprevAs I understand it, what prompted Prop 13, aside from the desire to serve the owners of the best land, was that while land values were rising astronomically, municipalities and elected representatives were eager to serve their constituents, who naturally wanted all the amenities that their governments cared to offer.And the municipalities -- their local elected representatives -- complied. They didn&#x27;t reduce the millage rate each year to stay revenue neutral. No, they used those funds to supply those desired public goods.And as land values rose, taxes rose. And eventually, people whose homes were appreciating by half (or 100% or more) of their annual incomes, increasing their home equity at an awesome rate, started objecting to the taxes that were paying for all those public goods.Remember that in those days, California&#x27;s colleges and universities were regarded as among the very best. And they changed a lot of lives, particularly of those in the school districts so well funded by those taxes that were ever-rising because the local officials didn&#x27;t lower the tax rate to remain revenue neutral.I don&#x27;t see any sign that California, under Prop 13, has any resemblance to Georgism.Take a look at a listing at realtor.com for a home in any California city or suburb, and focus on the \"Property History\" section, on (1) asking and selling prices; and, under that (2) assessment and tax history. (Choose the \"see more\" option in each section.) Then look at the assessments vs the current asking price. The land and \"additions\" figures rise by no more than 2% per year, while the asking and selling prices are far above the assessment on which taxes are based.\"The land value component is re-accessed frequently and changes based on comparables (presumably but its mostly black box).\" No, they rise by 2% per year, until a sale takes place, at which point their sum is adjusted to the selling price.But the house next door, of similar age and condition, but not sold in 20 or 40 years, is receiving a huge subsidy, paying a tiny fraction of what the newly sold neighboring buyers are paying.Where is the equity in that?The answer, for other states, is not assessment caps or capping taxes at a certain percentage of assessed value, but reducing the millage rate to remain revenue neutral, unless the local property owners approve a millage rate that is higher than revenue neutral because they actively desire more services, better schools, etc. reply somethoughts 6 hours agorootparentAgreed. I was primarily highlighting that California (and many states) tax code has components of LVT already and therefore have elements&#x2F;influences of Georgism.It&#x27;s just not purist Georgism.And even if LVT was the only source of tax income - it could be done at punitive level to prevent all land speculation or be more relaxed.I think somethings that I haven&#x27;t seen addressed by pure Georgists:- Where to stick schools and playgrounds to support the newly built residential towers- Water&#x2F;sewage&#x2F;gas improvements&#x2F;transportation stresses- Displaced people who get kicked out of the single family home if no private developer wants to build condos for themFrom what I can tell - it&#x27;d require proper pre-planned zoning when the city is in its early stages and for the stuff to be written into the city charter.Or some strong government intervention that could just plop new 3 story schools and 10 store public housing towers where it wants. reply fergie 3 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Georgism reply hn_throwaway_99 6 hours agoparentprevI think the Wikipedia entry, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Land_value_tax, actually does a pretty good job explaining land value taxes, and specifically in explaining the benefits compared to property taxes. reply acchow 6 hours agoparentprevTaxing the structure on the land is a negative incentive on developing the land reply xmprt 7 hours agoparentprevThe way I see it, taxes are disincentives on bad behavior.

No room for argument.A LVT gives power to the government to unilaterally declare that in some alternate universe, your plot of land might be worth a lot more, so they&#x27;ll just go right ahead and tax you on that speculative amount in the absence of any evidence.That sounds very open to abuse. reply HDThoreaun 3 hours agorootparentprevWell no, because people sell entire houses so you can use that to anchor valuations. LVT is only taxing part of the purchase, much harder to disentangle. reply hn_throwaway_99 3 hours agorootparentNot at all, and any property assessor will tell you this (e.g. property assessments usually already separate land vs improvements). Nearly all houses are insured, so it&#x27;s easy to calculate land value as sales price - insured value, basically because insurance only covers the cost of the house.Plus, nearly all locales either have empty lots that are sold, or if there is no more room have houses that are sold as teardowns, and in either case that gives you an unambiguous land value. reply brutusborn 3 hours agorootparentprevAssessment definitely isn&#x27;t easy, but some fairly simple solutions exist.For example, people could self-assess their land&#x27;s value.

The most significant budget item in most municipalities here is education, followed by road maintenance, which is often extremely costly. In Massachusetts, the basic cost estimate for repaving a standard road is approximately $1 million per mile, and this investment typically only lasts about a decade before it requires another round of expensive repairs.Bridges are even more financially burdensome. Recently, we replaced a culvert that was so small I could easily jump over it, and yet it set us back $700,000. Keep in mind; we&#x27;re talking about a town with a population of around 1,000 people, and we have over 30 of these culverts and bridges scattered across our approximately 80 miles of road within a 55-square-mile area. If you&#x27;re familiar with the region, you might even be able to pinpoint which town I&#x27;m referring to.To add to the challenge, not only do we have to repave our roads every 7-10 years to prevent them from falling into disrepair, but we also have to maintain them for safety, plow them, and salt them for safe travel. Over the past three decades, the expectations for maintaining these infrastructures have significantly increased.The problem lies in the way taxes are structured, which is based on the combined value of land and improvements (buildings). Particularly in smaller towns and cities, most people are trying to get the most affordable option. This approach encourages sprawl, resulting in substantial infrastructure construction and maintenance costs. In larger cities (unlike mine), the upkeep of water and sewer lines are another considerable addition.In more suburban communities, we&#x27;re witnessing the aging of infrastructure that was originally constructed during the early days of the automobile era. The cost of replacing this aging infrastructure is substantial, but growth expectations, which used to help fund these projects, are dwindling. Many people who moved a few miles outside the city center still expect the same level of services without understanding the financial implications. This situation places a significant strain on tax funds, leaving us with limited resources to invest in valuable critical community needs and values.We now live in a small city in multi-unit building that has ~60 ft of road frontage, and is right in downtown. The building has 6 apartments so has considerable value. But our _infrastructure_ costs are tiny compared to those that live in suburbia. Why are we paying more taxes for helping the city be efficient?MA GL says you have to tax everyone on their property value - so someone in a 250K house out in suburbia that costs the town huge amounts to maintain their roads, sewers and water, actually costs the town money -- while a downtown 6-unit $1.5M building next to others that use the same services, is a boon.And what made that possible? The proliferation of the automobile.We need our tax system to promote density - which means you can spend more tax money on things that matter.(this has been edited in places by ChatGPT) reply LapsangGuzzler 7 hours agorootparentThe Strong Towns YouTube channel makes many similar points. Suburban construction in the US is terribly inefficient and wasteful in the long run by maximizing the convenience auto accessibility at the expense of everything else. If infrastructure had a technical debt equivalent, it would be suburban planning. reply telotortium 6 hours agorootparentOne thing I think Strong Towns would do better to emphasize is that their argument that suburbs are financially unsustainable applies more to those suburbs of struggling towns or small cities. I don&#x27;t believe suburbs of large, economically healthy cities are running into unsustainable infrastructure costs nearly as much. They may run into funding difficulties if the suburb becomes an undesirable area, or if the pension fund bankrupts the city, but they don&#x27;t seem to be running into the issue that their property taxes can&#x27;t fund them. reply briHass 6 hours agorootparentExactly. ST seems to want to conflate areas that would probably be considered &#x27;rural&#x27; with actual suburbs of large metro areas. Look at some of the towns mentioned in their &#x27;suburbs bad&#x27; articles and you&#x27;ll note they are usually quite far from a city, and usually that city is 2nd or 3rd tier (and likely facing its own financial issues.)If anything, many of these rural&#x2F;exurb communities are already at the minimum population needed to support the industries that must exist outside of dense&#x2F;expensive cities. These aren&#x27;t the overpriced McMansions full of entitled upper class folks, those tend to be located near the city, and are quite healthy financially due to outsized local tax revenues. reply ab_goat 7 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t watched many of their YouTube, but I concur that Strong Towns knows what&#x27;s up.For anyone that doesn&#x27;t know what a \"stroad\" is, I hope you look into it. You&#x27;ll never see the world the same again. reply ilamont 6 hours agorootparentprevEastern Mass resident here. Thanks for sharing this. I wish our elected officials were so transparent with these basic facts when they discuss road improvement projects.In my city we pay a negligible “excise tax” on our vehicles. It’s like $100 for 2 older cars. If it were doubled or even tripled in think most people could afford it. This would seem to be the logical way to pay for road improvements, or a municipal gas tax.Yes, people would skirt it (there already is a problem with people’s registering their cars in New Hampshire to avoid the excise tax, or driving over state lines to buy gasoline). But if even 80% of residents paid the taxes, it would make a real difference to municipal budgets for fixing roads. reply simonsarris 8 hours agorootparentprev> Bridges are even more financially burdensome.

I suspect the reality of a privately maintained road is still subject to regulatory overhead. reply paganel 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been saying this in relation to all the paving that is done throughout my Eastern-European country with EU money, that is that at some point having that many paved roads around becomes economically unproductive, especially when it comes to communities that are getting older and smaller (in terms of numbers).I&#x27;ve been answered something on the lines of \"but all those paved roads will create economic activity and we will all become richer and we will be able to afford their maintenance going forward\", which is reportedly not true anymore (also because of demographics and of the ageing population). It might have been true some decades ago, when the demographics were different and the age pyramid was more \"normal\", but not anymore. reply nukeman 8 hours agoparentprevI’d be interested to hear your thoughts, this jibes with mine on the subject to an extent. reply ab_goat 7 hours agorootparentCommented on other reply first... please see there. reply maxerickson 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure that underfunded pensions are a bigger problem than anything else.Especially for services (where the value is concentrated at the time of delivery). reply ab_goat 8 hours agorootparentUnderfunded pensions are a problem only because tax revenue must be spent on maintaining unsustainable infrastructure that was originally built on an expectation of never-ending growth.If that infrastructure costs were not so high, there would be sufficient money to pay people what they deserved. reply maxerickson 7 hours agorootparentpay people what they deserved.Yeah, that&#x27;s not the point. The point is that taxpayers receiving services should pay for what it costs to pay people what they deserve, not saddle the future with those costs. reply ab_goat 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t necessarily disagree.But the issue has been that municipal taxes are a zero-sum game. People expect taxes to stay at a constant level unless they are getting additional services. So allocating more taxes in one place pulls taxes from another.By not funding retirement immediately, you can keep taxes constant and not diminish current services.But most importantly, the single-most-explanative reason why we services have gotten more expensive is because of this ignored tsunami of additional costs caused by the proliferation of the automobile. reply maxerickson 7 hours agorootparentYes, it&#x27;s very convenient to have someone else pay for stuff. reply zone411 5 hours agorootparentprevInfrastructure spending is dwarfed by expenditures on education, healthcare, or public safety. reply hknmtt 2 hours agoprevStrangely, I am in europe and here there is separate property and land tax and as far as i know it always was like that.

It will. But not as much as anyone hopes. They have to eliminate taxes on all improvements to the land and tax the land itself only. Also remove code and zoning restrictions on it.

To make up for the revenues lost, land will be taxed at a new rate of 11.8%This sounds like it&#x27;s revenue neutral, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like they&#x27;re squeezing more.

If that&#x27;s what you believe then that&#x27;s fine, but it would be better to be upfront about what argument you are making. reply AmericanChopper 8 hours agorootparentProperty taxes and wealth taxes undermine property rights in ways that normal income taxes don’t. If I earn $100 and pay tax on it, whatever’s left over is mine forever, and I never have to pay tax on that income again. If I buy $100 worth of property, I have to pay tax on it again every year forever, which basically means I’m only buying the right to rent it from the government in perpetuity.Your use of the phrase “rent seeking” is also a bit weird. It sounds like any extraction of value from capital would meet your definition. It’s fine if you object to a persons right to extract value from their capital, but rent seeking typically describes attempting to extract value from capital _without_ reciprocating any productive value to the person who’s paying you. Which is certainly not the case with land use. reply friend_and_foe 7 hours agorootparentI used to agree with you, then I read Falkvinge&#x27;s proposal of a taxless state and it changed my mind. I&#x27;m now convinced that property tax (or more accurately, land tax) is the only justified tax, or more generally, that all taxes paid must be tied explicitly and characteristic to a service rendered, and that the only services a state should be allowed to render must be administration of a commons.You cannot defend your land property from even a marginally better equipped aggressor who seeks to take it from you. You need a court system, or for a larger aggressor, an army, to do it for you. This means that de facto, the state with the armed men owns the land. Land tax is tantamount to a fee you pay to lease it. Also it can be framed as just payment for a service rendered, that is, the service of defending your property for you. Furthermore, any entity that \"owns\" land property and gets protection of his claim by a court or army that does not pay a land tax is free riding.Income taxes are unjust. By the logic of the premise, land tax that pays for anything but defense of claim to the land is unjust. Wealth taxes are unjust, as are capital gains. Tarrifs that fund a navy to protect shipments on the high seas would be just, as would registration fees to bay for highway infrastructure. The core rules are, the state must only solve a tragedy of the commons, the tax that funds such an endeavor must derive directly from benefitting from that endeavor and it must only ever be used for that endeavor. With these axioms it is easy to deduce which taxes are just and which are not, they&#x27;re all payment for services rendered for a service for which a state is the optimal organization to provide.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;falkvinge.net&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;01&#x2F;a-simplified-taxless-state-... reply fells 6 hours agorootparentSo much of commerce is predicated on contracts, and courts&#x2F;the government help enforce them.

To what extent? reply mortify 7 hours agorootparentprevLand ownership must be enforced by court of law, and that&#x27;s true of all property. Yet land ownership is the easiest to maintain.

I experimented with similar stuff months ago and basically parallelized everything into multiple requests to different agents in pre and post-processing steps. The main context window, for example, wasn&#x27;t aware of memories being generated or retrieved. I had a post-processor just automatically generating memories and saving them, along with all the conversations being saved in a vector database, and a pre-processor that would automatically inject relevant memories and context based on the conversation, even re-writing the history so it would look to the main context window like the memory had always been there.It saved a lot of space in the main context window for unnecessary system prompts and so on. reply pacjam 11 hours agoparentThese are all great points - who or what you ask to manage memory is a design decision and IMO there&#x27;s two main ways to do it (in the context of chatbots):* implicit memory management, where the \"main LLM\" (or for chat, the \"dialogue thread\") is unaware that memory is being managed in the background (by a \"memory LLM\", a rule-based script, a small neural network, etc.), and* explicit memory management (MemGPT), where one LLM does everythingPrior research in multi-session &#x2F; long-range chat is often implicit, with a designated memory creation process. If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say the vast majority of consumer chatbots that implement some type of memory store are also implicit. This is because getting explicit memory management to work requires a lot of complex instruction following, and in our experience this just isn&#x27;t possible at the moment with most publicly available LLMs (we&#x27;re actively looking into ways to fix this via eg fine-tuning open models).The tradeoffs are as you mentioned: with implicit, you don&#x27;t have to stuff all the memory management instructions into the LLM preprompt (in MemGPT, the total system message is ~1k tokens). But on the upside, explicit memory management (when the LLM works) makes the overall system a lot simpler - there&#x27;s no need to manage multiple LLM models running on parallel threads, which can add a lot of overhead. reply spaintech 14 hours agoparentprevThis is a fascinating approach. I’m working on something similar but as part of the feedback loop, as you said, rewriting history with transactional data as part of the context window. I feel as though the LLM and the NLP could potentially be a more realizable interface to structured data, well, I should say, this is the idea we are exploring. For us, as data is created (within a certain context of the business) we extract the data, generate the embeddings and build out the vector database as to:Pre and Post-Processing:- Post-Processing: After the main model responds, a post-processor takes over, automatically generating memories from the conversation and saving them. This ensures that important context is stored without burdening the primary model with these tasks. We also execute any relevan business logic as part of the request, then feed that back to the systems…- Pre-Processing: Before a new input is sent to the main model, a pre-processor checks saved memories and injects relevant context. * executes logic * It’s as if this pre-processor gives the main model a “refresher” on prior conversations, preparing it to provide more informed and consistent responses. reply sabareesh 12 hours agoparentprevMulti Agent has several potential, I am having more confidence as there is some level of entropy on agent reply that makes it a worthwhile reply keithnoizu 13 hours agoparentprevYes, I have a similar solution. reply huevosabio 13 hours agoprevGood job!On the limitations you wrote: ``` Similarly, we also found that the most popular the Llama 2 70B model variants (even those fine-tuned for function calling) would consistently generate incorrect function calls or even hallucinate functions outside the providede schema. ```You could use grammar-based sampling [0] to ensure that the function call is at least syntactically correct.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ggerganov&#x2F;llama.cpp&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;grammars reply pacjam 12 hours agoparentGrammar-based sampling is a great idea and a perfect fit for something like MemGPT! In our experiments using MemGPT with non-gpt-4 models, the biggest issue impacting performance ended up being incorrect use of function parameters and function hallucination. For example, even large models finetuned on function call data (eg https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;jondurbin&#x2F;airoboros-l2-70b-2.1#agentf...) would generally output correct parsable JSON, but the arguments or function name would be wrong. For example the LLM might output a call to `personal_diary.add` (never specified in the preprompt) instead of the correct `working_context.append` call (explicitly specified in the preprompt) when trying to write data. reply radarsat1 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t see why you&#x27;d need to stop at \"grammar\".

It&#x27;s all open source and under Apache 2.0, and we&#x27;re actively looking at integrating common workflows to the CLI.You&#x27;re correct that MemGPT doesn&#x27;t do editing of LLM weights like in ROME - the \"memory\" we&#x27;re considering in MemGPT is at the text&#x2F;token level, not the weight level. The core concepts behind MemGPT is giving the LLM the ability to edit a working memory scratchpad (held in-context) and reading&#x2F;writing to external context via functions. An important detail is that reads are always paginated (chunked) to deal with finite context limits, and MemGPT can do many iterative read&#x2F;writes from a single user input (by chaining functions together). This allows MemGPT to search over a large database of documents for example, collecting information from various sources to return an answer (as in our LlamaIndex API docs example on the README). reply Difwif 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve had a suspicion for a while now that this is what ChatGPT does within a conversation (chat.openai.com, not the api). I&#x27;ve had very long chat histories that seem to gracefully degrade instead of just forgetting everything. Maybe there&#x27;s more clues in the context than I realize though.Either way this type of idea will probably be a fundamental feature for all chat bots in the future IMO. reply pacjam 15 hours agoparentRecursive summarization is a simple and popular way to provide the illusion of infinite context (when you need to free up space, just summarize the oldest N messages into 1 summary message). It&#x27;s lossy and you&#x27;ll inevitably lose important information, but it should degrade relatively gracefully. In MemGPT we use (implicit) recursive summarization on top of all the explicit memory management. reply ASalazarMX 15 hours agorootparentWould this be the same method used to assign a title to your chat based on the first prompt? It&#x27;s surprisingly effective at getting the core idea most of the time. reply pacjam 14 hours agorootparentThanks for your interest! Question - does the title of the chat ever change after it&#x27;s first assigned? If so, using a recursive summary to refresh the title sounds like a reasonable idea (especially if you&#x27;re already computing a summary to extend context).From what I remember the title in ChatGPT gets set once after a few messages, in which case I&#x27;d assume it&#x27;s generated with a special \"title generation\" prompt (that gets the first few messages as input).In either case since I don&#x27;t work at OpenAI I can&#x27;t tell you for sure ;) reply icelancer 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is how we do things at our work with the API and chunking since we don&#x27;t have the 32k API. It works fairly well in limited windows. reply hansvm 15 hours agoparentprevThere are definitely a lot more clues than you realize (plus the context window is something like 12 written pages of standard English text, without much space wasted for the system prompts). If you were doing anything interesting at all, the output is heavily biased by your prompt. You lose some bits of information in that you only have one sample (the previous output&#x2F;history) rather than the soft probabilities, and you lose some bits in that multiple inputs can map to the same output (like the class of prompts \"output the 2nd letter of the following phrase: ...\"), but real-world prompts tend to be the easiest&#x2F;shortest thing to come to mind that you think will give you the result you&#x27;re looking for, so the LLM&#x27;s best guess for that prompt (there are lots of ways of guessing, so suppose for the sake of argument you did something like textual inversion on the one sample) is likely to not be a half-bad interpretation of the missing context -- i.e., a lot of the seemingly missing information was retained in the LLM&#x27;s output, and you don&#x27;t lose too many bits at a time as the old context trails off. reply shishirpatil 15 hours agoparentprevYeah!

And hopefully with some of the techniques we introduce here, we can think of designing perpetual chat bots! reply wokwokwok 10 hours agoprev> Resursive summarization (Wu et al., 2021b) is a simple way to address overflowing context windows, however, recursive summarization is inherently lossy and eventually leads to large holes in the memory of the system.Yes, it does.> In our experiments ... conversational context is read-only with a special eviction policy (if the queue reaches a certain size, a portion of the front is truncated or compressed via recursive summarization), and working context is writeable by the LLM processor via function calls.You&#x27;re doing the same thing, and you have the same problems.You&#x27;re just doing it slightly differently; in this case instead of recursively summarizing everything, you&#x27;re selectively searching the history and generating it for each request. Cool idea....but, I&#x27;m skeptical; this fundamentally relies on the assumption that the existing context consists of low entropy summarizable context, and that any query relies only on a subset of the history.This might be true for, eg. chat, or &#x27;answer question about some document in this massive set of documents&#x27;....but, both of these assumptions are false in some contexts; for example, generating code, where the context is densely packed with information which is not discardable (eg. specific api definitions), and a wide context is required (ie. many api definitions).It is interesting how this is structured and done, and hey, the demo is cool.I&#x27;m annoyed to see these papers about summary things fail to acknowledge the fundamental limitations of the approach. reply pacjam 9 hours agoparentThanks for checking out the paper! Just to clarify in case there was any misunderstanding, recursive summarization is just one part of the memory management in MemGPT: as you mentioned, in MemGPT the conversation queue is managed via recursive summarization, just like in prior work (and many chatbot implementations). However there is also a (read&#x2F;write) \"pinned\" section of \"LLM memory\" that&#x27;s unrelated to recursive summarization, we call this \"working context\" in the paper. So MemGPT has access to both recursive summaries (generated automatically), as well as working context, which MemGPT actively manages to keep up-to-date.These are both separate from MemGPT&#x27;s external context, which is pulled into the conversation queue via function calls. In all our examples, reads from external context are uncompressed (no summarization) and paginated. MemGPT receives a system alert when the queue summarization is triggered, so if MemGPT needs to keep specific details from the conversation queue it can write it to working context before it&#x27;s erased or summarized.In the conversational agent examples, working context (no summarization, and separate from the conversation queue) is used to store key facts about the user and agent to maintain consistent conversation. Because the working context is always seen by the LLM, there&#x27;s no need to retrieve it to see it. In doc QA, working context can be used to keep track of the current task&#x2F;question and progress towards that task (for complex queries, this helps MemGPT keep track of details like the previous search, previous page request, etc.). reply wokwokwok 8 hours agorootparent> Just to clarify in case there was any misunderstandingI am not confused.It&#x27;s good; it solves a specific set of problems with querying large datasets, the same as a vector search would....but the various memory zones you&#x27;ve created make absolutely no difference to the fundamental limitation of the LLM context length.No matter how you swing it, this is just creative prompt engineering. You&#x27;re packing the context with relevant information; but, if you have too much relevant information, it won&#x27;t work. reply majestic5762 6 hours agorootparentprevWe took a similar approach like MemGPT (working memory: summarized conversation with eviction), but our long memory is a graph we can operate on (add&#x2F;remove&#x2F;edit nodes & edges).

There&#x27;s no clear infinite tape equivalent in MemGPT, but you can view the virtual context loosely as a tape. Moving the head could correspond to MemGPT indexing into virtual context - if the data is in-context (inside the LLM window), it&#x27;s a direct read, but if data isn&#x27;t there (it may&#x2F;may not be stored in external context), the read requires a function call to \"page in\" the data. reply upghost 16 hours agoprevabsolutely stellar work to you and your team.

I was thinking about how to approach a similar problem for a project I&#x27;m working on, and my approach is similar.I am curious about the benefit of having the agent interact with the user (or doing the task) and managing its memory instead of having an observer agent that modifies the memory separately. The thought process is to let the agent use all of its tokens to focus on the task and not memory management. reply pacjam 23 hours agoparentExplicit memory management (MemGPT-style) vs implicit&#x2F;external memory management is an interesting tradeoff. Like you said, adding all the instructions on how to manage memory consumes ~1k tokens (using the default prompts on our MemGPT GitHub release), which is a lot when your context window is 8k. Additionally, it requires the base LLM to be very good at instruction following; gpt-4 can do it well, but it&#x27;s much more difficult to get explicit memory management to work with gpt-3.5-turbo or llama2 70b finetunes (so to build a robust system, you may have to end up having to \"split\" the thinking out of necessity).One of the main benefits of explicit memory management is simplicity - e.g., you don&#x27;t have to manage logic between a \"memory creation\" thread and a \"dialogue thread\". The explicit approach also integrates well with the iterative paging&#x2F;retrieval for document analysis we demo in the paper&#x2F;on GitHub. reply quickthrower2 18 hours agoprevBeen thinking about this. My naive way to do this using existing LLMs is to have a JSON the LLM can spit out when it wants to store and then then calling code shoves that in a “RAG” DB. It also has the ability to generate queries if it’s knowledge. reply pacjam 18 hours agoparentThis is similar to how our external context is implemented under the hood - you might be interested in our perpetual chat bot example in the GitHub repo (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpacker&#x2F;MemGPT), the message traces in the demo GIF should give you an idea of how things work at a glance. reply earth2mars 16 hours agoprevIt would be interesting to see how does ring attention technique affect this.

The current chatbots aren&#x27;t really useful to me as long-term AI... \"companions\" ;) because they forget anything personal every 15 minutes reply hereforcomments 1 day agoprevThere will be a Hackathon at work and with my team mate we are preparing with some kind of hierarchical memory&#x2F;knowledge solution.Briefly: we tell ChatGPT what API based tools we have, explaines them in 1 sentence and where it can reach their documentation. We added documentations as endpoint. example.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;main is always the starting point that returns high level overview of the app and all available endpoints to call. Every endpoint has its own documentation as well. E.g.: &#x2F;geocoder has &#x2F;docs&#x2F;geocoder documentation endpoint that describes what it does, what input it expects and what it will return.We also provieded ChatGPT with actions like read_docs, call_endpoint and end_conversation. An action is a structured JSON object with a set of parameters. If ChatGPT wants to interact with the mentioned resources, it emits an action, it gets executed and the answer fed back to it.With this I can do a task like: \"Get a 30 minutes drivetime polygon around 15 Bond Street, London and send it to Foster.\"It plans and executes the following all alone. First it calls the geocoder to get the coordinates for the isochrone endpoint, then gets the isochrone by calling the isochrone endpoint and saves it, calls Microsoft Graph API and queries my top 50 connections to find out who Foster is and calls the MS Graph API&#x27;s send mail endpoint to send the email with attachment to Foster.It can hierarchically explore the available resources so we don&#x27;t need a huge context window and we don&#x27;t have to train the model either. Also we could implement multiple agents. 1 would be a manager and there could me multiple agents to perform each task and return the results to the manager. It would furthet reduce reduce the required context window.Very likely some BS app will win the Hackathon like always like a market price predictor using Weka&#x27;s multilayer perceptron with default settings but we believe our solution could be extremely powerful. reply a1j9o94 1 day agoparentThis is interesting. Can you expand on how this gets around the context window problem? Are you thinking the agent does a one-off task rather than continuing back and forth with the user?I do think this will be way less than having all of the functions listed to begin with though. I think the discoverability is a novel approach. Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised ChatGPT with plugins doesn&#x27;t do something like this by default rather than making you pick which plugins you want at the beginning of the conversation. reply hereforcomments 1 day agorootparentFirst, the discoverability reduces the required context window. We don&#x27;t have to explain every app we have, it&#x27;s enough to tell ChatGPT one sentence about them and it will go deeper if it thinks that would help it to perform the task.Also, we have not implemented it, we can have one or multiple level of managers just like at a company and each would delegate a task to a worker (who could also be a manager) and they would report back the result. Just like in real life, a manager doesn&#x27;t have to know how something is done, it should only know it&#x27;s done and the get the results.We work for a large company and very likely have 100s of apps. We could build wrappers around them e.g. using selenium and we could interact with even old apps.We could also do the same approach with databases. The db itself would have docs, each table and each field as well. So we could ask ChatGPT to query data from the db and it could fully understand the data before writing the sql query. reply novax81 1 day agorootparentI&#x27;ve written about some hierarchical manager system with some friends when exploring how to use AI for larger set tasks. While the easy answer is simply using something with much larger context - `Claude` is amazing with an API key if you&#x27;re on the waitlist - we definitely followed the same idea of splitting up the context into individual groups.We had some success actually with layering another AI into the mix - having one AI look at a summary version of the context as a whole, and decide which pieces of context to assign to each manager. This of course requires a sidestep into another database of some kind to store the \"master context\" (AKA the full conversation, so you likely already have it in some form of storage), and of course a lot more calls to the AI which overall increases latency quite a bit.1. Use an AI to provide a short summary of each piece of logical context and map it by access ID 2. Use another AI to determine which pieces contain the most useful additional context to the piece of the task being evaluated 3.

    "originBody": "Eli Bendersky's website About Archives Better HTTP server routing in Go 1.22 October 16, 2023 at 05:17 Tags Go , Network Programming An exciting proposal is expected to land in Go 1.22 - enhancing the pattern-matching capabilities of the default HTTP serving multiplexer in the net/http package. The existing multiplexer (http.ServeMux) offers rudimentary path matching, but not much beyond that. This led to a cottage industry of 3rd party libraries to implement more powerful capabilities. I've explored these options in my REST Servers in Go series, in parts 1 and 2. The new multiplexer in 1.22 is going to significantly bridge the gap from 3rd party packages by providing advanced matching. In this short post I'll provide a quick introduction to the new multiplexer (mux). I'll also revisit the example from the REST Servers in Go series and compare how the new stdlib mux fares against gorilla/mux. Using the new mux If you've ever used a 3rd party mux / router package for Go (like gorilla/mux), using the new standard mux is going to be straightforward and familiar. Start by reading its documentation - it's short and sweet. Let's look at a couple of basic usage examples. Our first example demonstrates some of the new pattern matching capabilities of the mux: package main import ( \"fmt\" \"net/http\" ) func main() { mux := http.NewServeMux() mux.HandleFunc(\"GET /path/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Fprint(w, \"got path\\n\") }) mux.HandleFunc(\"/task/{id}/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { id := r.PathValue(\"id\") fmt.Fprintf(w, \"handling task with id=%v\\n\", id) }) http.ListenAndServe(\"localhost:8090\", mux) } Experienced Go programmers will notice two new features right away: In the first handler, the HTTP method (GET in this case) is specified explicitly as part of the pattern. This means that this handler will only trigger for GET requests to paths beginning with /path/, not for other HTTP methods. In the second handler, there's a wildcard in the second path component - {id}, something that wasn't supported before. The wildcard will match a single path component and the handler can then access the matched value through the PathValue method of the request. Since Go 1.22 hasn't been released yet, I recommend running this sample with gotip. Please see the complete code sample with full instructions for running this. Let's take this server for a ride: $ gotip run sample.go And in a separate terminal we can issue some curl calls to test it: $ curl localhost:8090/what/ 404 page not found $ curl localhost:8090/path/ got path $ curl -X POST localhost:8090/path/ Method Not Allowed $ curl localhost:8090/task/f0cd2e/ handling task with id=f0cd2e Note how the server rejects a POST request to /path/, while the (default for curl) GET request is allowed. Note also how the id wildcard gets assigned a value when the request matches. Once again, I encourage you to review the documentation of the new ServeMux. You'll learn about additional capabilities like matching trailing paths to a wildcard with {id}..., strict matching of a path end with {$}, and other rules. Particular care in the proposal was given to potential conflicts between different patterns. Consider this setup: mux := http.NewServeMux() mux.HandleFunc(\"/task/{id}/status/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { id := r.PathValue(\"id\") fmt.Fprintf(w, \"handling task status with id=%v\\n\", id) }) mux.HandleFunc(\"/task/0/{action}/\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { action := r.PathValue(\"action\") fmt.Fprintf(w, \"handling task 0 with action=%v\\n\", action) }) And suppose the server receives a request for /task/0/status/ -- which handler should it go to? It matches both! Therefore, the new ServeMux documentation meticulously describes the precedence rules for patterns, along with potential conflicts. In case of a conflict, the registration panics. Indeed, for the example above we get something like: panic: pattern \"/task/0/{action}/\" (registered at sample-conflict.go:14) conflicts with pattern \"/task/{id}/status/\" (registered at sample-conflict.go:10): /task/0/{action}/ and /task/{id}/status/ both match some paths, like \"/task/0/status/\". But neither is more specific than the other. /task/0/{action}/ matches \"/task/0/action/\", but /task/{id}/status/ doesn't. /task/{id}/status/ matches \"/task/id/status/\", but /task/0/{action}/ doesn't. The message is detailed and helpful. If we encounter conflicts in complex registration schemes (especially when patterns are registered in multiple places in the source code), such details will be much appreciated. Redoing my task server with the new mux The REST Servers in Go series implements a simple server for a task/todo-list application in Go, using several different approaches. Part 1 starts with a \"vanilla\" standard library approach, and Part 2 reimplements the same server using the gorilla/mux router. Now is a great time to reimplement it once again, but with the enhanced mux from Go 1.22; it will be particularly interesting to compare the solution to the one using gorilla/mux. The full code for this project is available here. Let's look at a few representative code samples, starting with the pattern registration [1]: mux := http.NewServeMux() server := NewTaskServer() mux.HandleFunc(\"POST /task/\", server.createTaskHandler) mux.HandleFunc(\"GET /task/\", server.getAllTasksHandler) mux.HandleFunc(\"DELETE /task/\", server.deleteAllTasksHandler) mux.HandleFunc(\"GET /task/{id}/\", server.getTaskHandler) mux.HandleFunc(\"DELETE /task/{id}/\", server.deleteTaskHandler) mux.HandleFunc(\"GET /tag/{tag}/\", server.tagHandler) mux.HandleFunc(\"GET /due/{year}/{month}/{day}/\", server.dueHandler) Just like in the gorilla/mux sample, here we use specific HTTP methods to route requests (with the same path) to different handlers; with the older http.ServeMux, such matchers had to go to the same handler, which would then decide what to do based on the method. Let's also look at one of the handlers: func (ts *taskServer) getTaskHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) { log.Printf(\"handling get task at %s\\n\", req.URL.Path) id, err := strconv.Atoi(req.PathValue(\"id\")) if err != nil { http.Error(w, \"invalid id\", http.StatusBadRequest) return } task, err := ts.store.GetTask(id) if err != nil { http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusNotFound) return } renderJSON(w, task) } It extracts the ID value from req.PathValue(\"id\"), similarly to the Gorilla approach; however, since we don't have a regexp specifying that {id} only matches integers, we have to pay attention to errors returned from strconv.Atoi. All and all, the end result is remarkably similar to the solution that uses gorilla/mux from part 2. The handlers are much better separated than in the vanilla stdlib approach, because the mux now can do much more sophisticated routing, without leaving many of the routing decisions to the handlers themselves. Conclusion \"Which router package should I use?\" has always been a FAQ for beginner Go programmers. I believe the common answers to this question will shift after Go 1.22 is released, as many will find the new stdlib mux sufficient for their needs without resorting to 3rd party packages. Others will stick to familiar 3rd party packages, and that's totally fine. Routers like gorilla/mux still provide more capabilities than the standard library; on top of it, many Go programmers opt for lightweight frameworks like Gin, which provide a router but also additional tools for building web backends. All in all, this is certainly a positive change for all Go users. Making the standard library more capable is a net positive for the entire community, whether people use 3rd party packages or stick to just the standard library. [1] You may have noticed that these patterns aren't very strict w.r.t path parts that come after the part we care about (e.g. /task/22/foobar). This is in line with the rest of the series, but the new http.ServeMux makes it very easy to restrict the paths with a trailing {$} wildcard, if needed.

I&#x27;m new to go and it is one of the things that felt most wrong.I&#x27;m used to a router where you define a big list of routes all in one place, maybe in some DSL. That&#x27;s very easy to refactor, and doesn&#x27;t have any ambiguity. If a library wants a route registered it puts a snippet in the docs for users to copy.Go in general seems to value clarity over magic at the expense of verbosity, and this is a puzzling exception. reply earthboundkid 17 hours agorootparentGo&#x27;s flag, log, image, and sql packages all work this way, so it&#x27;s not just the HTTP router. I sort of see both sides. Having implicit registration makes it very easy to have different teams working on different packages and you just import the package and it registers itself. But it also makes the behavior of the resulting final binary hard to understand and based on implicit code instead of explicit. I personally try to just have one big routes() http.Handler function that returns everything all in one place, but I get why that isn&#x27;t always practical. reply silasdavis 16 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t feel to me like much of a gain over having said team expose a specific default self registration function. Then that act can be explicit rather than action at a distance on some dependency defined global state.I think this pattern in the standard library is a mistake. reply Groxx 13 hours agorootparentYeah, the trade-off is literally: import _ \"thing\"Vs: import \"thing\" thing.Register()But one uses a strange construct to save a single line, loses the ability to control order, and encourages people to use globals that they can&#x27;t control. reply flakes 7 hours agorootparentI very much dislike import side effects in any language. Im a lot happier where thing.Register() is still forced to happen in the main function.Still, I can understand it for some components like loggers to not add boiler plate to every library. However, I was very uneasy to see that enabling gzip decompression in a gRPC server is done through a magic _ import. You have to initialize the server anyways, so why not just make it an explicit function argument? reply cowl 7 hours agorootparentprevthing.Register() may register a route that conflicts with yours and it will never be matched in this case if declaration order was taken into account. You may discover this too late when you either have missed important calls on that thing or when requests intended for that thing are causing unintended effects on your first declared route. reply Groxx 6 hours agorootparentThat is all also true when doing the same thing in an init func. reply rob74 14 hours agorootparentprevWell, yeah, with the \"implicit registration\" model you can either split it up or do it in a central place, whereas if they would require you to do it in a central place, you wouldn&#x27;t have that choice. It probably boils down to \"library\" vs. \"framework\" - Go&#x27;s standard library doesn&#x27;t want (as much as possible) to be a framework that forces you to do things its way, and as far as I&#x27;m concerned that&#x27;s ok... reply numbsafari 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not an exception. There is no magic.Large code bases are large, and not every program is your simple crud app with a handful of endpoints that can be meaningfully managed a single function. reply troupo 17 hours agorootparentHard panic in a \"not simple app with large codebase\" app because you couldn&#x27;t match a route is amateur hour. reply msmith 15 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re assuming that the panic happens when a request is received, but it actually happens when a conflicting route is registered.To me, that&#x27;s reasonable behavior and is consistent with other things such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkg.go.dev&#x2F;regexp#MustCompile reply numbsafari 16 hours agorootparentprevI think you are vastly oversimplifying what has been said or why it works the way that it does. I really recommend you read the design document and reasoning, as it is rather clear why they are doing it the way that they are. If you have a cogent contribution to the discussion, please do share. reply troupo 12 hours agorootparentOthers have already contributed more than enough.People&#x27;s willingness to defend any and all of go&#x27;s dubious decisions is really baffling. reply smoyer 10 hours agorootparentprevRegistering handlers is a startup activity ... Practically the only time I allow a panic in my code. I also have unit tests for the entire startup sequence so theoretically code with ambiguous handlers would never be committed. reply cowl 10 hours agorootparentprevHow is this new to Go? Almost all Java frameworks that rely on Annotations do registration at a distance. Controllers are Routinely declared on different packages and even injected from dependency libraries. reply throwaway2037 9 hours agorootparentI agree with most of this post. The one exception in my experience: Vertx. I never saw any annotations for routing. It is a very verbose library, but that means there is no black magic. reply gwd 20 hours agoparentprev> Are there go-specific reasons for that?In general, the reason you use a compiled &#x2F; typed language like golang at all (instead of, say, perl) is to \"left shift\" your bugs: A bug caught when you first spin up your application is better than a bug caught after a corner case acts up in the wild, and a bug caught when you compile is better than a bug caught when you first spin up your application.I recently ran a cross a bug in a side project of mine (using gorilla&#x2F;mux) where I had accidentally made overlapping routes. If the router had panic&#x27;ed instead of running, I would have been nudged to refactor the URLs and completely avoided the bug. reply chewbacha 18 hours agorootparentWouldn’t the “left-shift” be a compiler error instead of a panic? reply Mawr 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s where the focus usually is, but aborting at startup is the next best thing. It&#x27;s an undervalued technique. reply cowl 9 hours agorootparentprevIt can not be decided on compile time but it provides the basis for a build time \"error\". It&#x27;s enough to have a testcase that registers your routes and the bug is descovered even before you commit potentially. reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparentprevIdeally.But that&#x27;s impractical, so the next soonest time is at startup. reply chimeracoder 18 hours agorootparentprevThis particular issue is undecideable at compile-time in the general case, so panicking on registration (ie, preventing the process from starting at all) is the next-most visible and noisy error option. reply bananapub 17 hours agorootparentprevGo as a language is generally not sophisticated enough to do that sort of thing.A counter- and&#x2F;or example of this is what Service Weaver does to try to bomb builds when generated files are older than their dependencies. reply tptacek 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m having trouble thinking of a mainstream production language with a stronger type system that could make a compile error out of the string argument passed to an HTTP router; can you think of one? Or of a non-string-typing for routes that solves the same problem, again in something people ordinarily use to deploy to production? reply farhaven 3 hours agorootparentOCaml can definitely do it (for example, you get a compiler error if you pass the wrong arguments to a `printf` where the format string specifies, say a number, but you pass in a string).Rust can very likely do it by leveraging their `build.rs` stuff to parse and validate call sites of the registration and parameters.Zig can probably do it with their comptime stuff.In theory, Go could do the same (but that would mean special-casing the `net&#x2F;http` handler registration in the compiler). At least `go vet` is smart enough to yell at you about wrong format string arguments. reply unchar1 12 hours agorootparentprevTypescript&#x27;s type system is known to be turing complete and people have implemented things such as sorting&#x2F;tree-walking just using types (i.e. during compile time) [1].I&#x27;d imagine something like this should be possible as well, but I&#x27;m not sure it would be worth it, considering the effort it would take to implement.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;anuraghazru&#x2F;status&#x2F;1511776290487279616 reply silasdavis 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m inclined to suggest the typescript could make compile errors of ambiguous routes, though I don&#x27;t see any obvious reasons way without an explicitly referenced agreggate type for existing routes. So perhaps not if routes are initialised implicitly like this.Template type strings with inference would also allow you to parse the strings in the type system.I cannot imagine wanting to build my routes table implicitly through import graph rather than having a specific place to aggregate. reply cfstras 16 hours agorootparentprevMost languages with macro or templating should be able to define this behavior as a library. Rust and C++ come to mind, for example. reply tptacek 15 hours agorootparentCan you provide an example of a Rust HTTP routing library that can generate a compile-time error for overlapping routes? reply tialaramex 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know of one, but you seemed to doubt not that it&#x27;s actively being done, but that it&#x27;s even possible, which is a very different proposition.Remember C++ actually implements checks at compile time for the modern std::format function. That is, if you mess up the text of a format string so that it&#x27;s invalid, C++ gives you a compile time error saying nope, that&#x27;s not a valid format.You might think that&#x27;s just compiler magic, as it is for say printf-style formats in C, but nope, works for custom formats too, it&#x27;s (extremely hairy) compile time executed C++. reply troupo 12 hours agorootparentprev> that could make a compile error out of the string argument passed to an HTTP routerFor example, Phoenix Verified Routes in Elixir: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hexdocs.pm&#x2F;phoenix&#x2F;Phoenix.VerifiedRoutes.html reply candiddevmike 16 hours agorootparentprev> \"left shift\" your bugs Are there go-specific reasons for that?

It ensures that you can’t write code that becomes ambiguous and hard to reason about, or become dependent on something random like the order code is initialised in, which may change for completely arbitrary reasons (for example renaming a file your taking advantage of Go’s special file level init func).> I&#x27;ve (ab)used the behavior of \"first to be matched wins\" a ton in my career - there&#x27;s been a bunch of \"business case\" times when I&#x27;ve needed like `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar` to be one registered route, and `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;{id}` to be another.It’s pretty trivial to write a handler that accepts the base path, and then routes to a different set of handler functions. Then the routing is clear and explicit.Ultimately if you want the behaviour not in the stdlib, plenty of other libraries exist out there with more functionality.The Go stdlib, and language in general has always skewed towards conservative behaviour in the face of possible ambiguity. Something I’ve always appreciated, because it means it’s easy build a strong and accurate intuition of how the stdlib works. You rarely find yourself in situations where what you think is the “obvious” answer isn’t the correct answer, simply because your idea of “obvious” doesn’t perfectly align with the authors idea of “obvious”. Being able to quickly and accurately read and understand code is far more valuable than saving a handful of seconds when writing it. reply robertlagrant 18 hours agorootparent> It’s pretty trivial to write a handler that accepts the base path, and then routes to a different set of handler functions. Then the routing is clear and explicit.It seems a little pointless to have route handling functionality that requires more route handling for pretty normal cases. reply avianlyric 15 hours agorootparentAlmost all the examples provided as \"pretty normal cases\" of having overlapping path registrations are already handled without panicking by the path precedence rules. All the cases where you have a wildcard path + handlers for specific variants of the wildcard values, are handled as expected without panics. Only the rather extreme corner case of having two wildcard paths, with wildcards in different locations, but still matching the same path, results in a panic.Honestly if you&#x27;re running into the second case above, I would question the wiseness of whatever it is you&#x27;re attempting to do, because reasoning about the behaviour is unlikely to be clear and obvious if registration order is the only differentiator. reply eknkc 20 hours agoparentprevI believe it allows `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar` and `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;{id}` as the first one is more specific and has precedence. This looks fine to me.Looks like it will panic in case you have `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;{id}&#x2F;delete` and `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;{action}`. &#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;delete will match both, none is more specific so it panics. Feels reasonable. Having a first one wins precedence might be better though. reply the_gipsy 18 hours agorootparentThe least surprising behavior would be matching `&#x2F;boo&#x2F;bar&#x2F;{action}`, since we&#x27;re dealing with path element separated by slashes, and the precedence case already exists otherwise. reply karmakaze 20 hours agorootparentprevI would expect and prefer the longer literal prefix to match. If the goal is to not have so many different routers in use, having some options like this case would be better than having one opinionated Go-way, which is how we end up with many libraries to fill common gaps. reply throwaway2990 17 hours agorootparentprevNa it’s dumb. Bar is very specific. It should be picked. reply troupo 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a 404 Not Found or 500 Server Error.HTTP server panicking is never reasonable reply avianlyric 15 hours agorootparentThe panic happens at handler registration i.e. binary startup, not while performing path matching. Having literally any tests in your application, literally anything that executes your binary before you ship it, will tell there&#x27;s a problem. Your code simply won&#x27;t be able start serving traffic if there&#x27;s path routing ambiguity.If you&#x27;ve managed to ship code that panicked during execution due to path routing ambiguity, then honestly your code is probably so riddled with bugs this is going to be the least of your issues. reply vhcr 19 hours agoparentprevGetting an error instead of the incorrect data because the route that was actually ran was another one is pretty good for debugging. I have actually ran into this with Django, one route was missing the ending \"$\" regex. reply danpalmer 19 hours agorootparentI get the frustration, but URL routing correctness is fairly trivially tested in Django and other frameworks to work around this issue, whereas it sounds like the matching algorithm here simply does not support certain common use-cases. reply badrequest 19 hours agorootparentWhat common use-cases does it not support? reply danpalmer 18 hours agorootparentThe `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar` and `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;*` use-case, where you want the first to go to a special page and the latter to go to some regular page. Perhaps the former is hard-coded&#x2F;static and the latter looks up some URL parameter in a database.You can of course always implement this within `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;*`, but then you&#x27;re implementing your own URL routing and working around the framework rather than working inside the framework.This feels to me like it&#x27;s a change designed for APIs, not a change designed for user-facing websites. For APIs URL structure is often well defined in a technical sense, and this sort of use-case is rare. For a user-facing site however there are UX concerns, marketing concerns, SEO concerns, all sorts of reasons why some lovely, technically correct REST-style URL structure just won&#x27;t work in practice. Unfortunately I know this from experience. reply greiskul 15 hours agorootparentThis work, the panic is only triggered when the precedence rules can&#x27;t fix a conflict.The behaviour documented here is actually extremely sensible and is best practices for anyone calling themselves a software engineer.

It seems that the latter matches the former. i.e. for the path `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar` there are 2 matching routes. One must take precedence, but this router doesn&#x27;t appear to allow that.This may just be a syntax thing, I was being loose with syntax, and meant that the `*` would match anything for the purposes of this example. reply badrequest 14 hours agorootparentprevThis pattern already works and would work with this change, you&#x27;d just need to define `&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar` first. reply lelanthran 18 hours agorootparentprevI understood what you were saying but it might be easier to read if you escaped the * characters. reply danpalmer 18 hours agorootparentHa! Whoops! Thanks reply assbuttbuttass 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure that example worked even before the recent changes.

Genuine question reply cowl 10 hours agorootparentprev> or let the user knowMany are misunderstanding when the panic happens. It does not happen when the user requests the path, it happens when the path is registered. The user will never arrive at that path to be notified.

It can be caught by the simplest of tests before you deploy your application. reply jupp0r 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a programmer&#x27;s error, so it should lead to a panic. There is simply no reason to ever handle this at runtime (as opposed to network errors or other things that can go wrong during normal operation and should be handled at runtime). reply drdaeman 13 hours agorootparentNot always, I can imagine a (weird, for sure) scenario where routes are a part of configuration, or are added dynamically at runtime.There’s `recover` of course, but I see no harm in returning an `error`, especially given that `errors.Join` is a thing now, so one doesn’t need to copy-paste ifs.The only reason not to is keeping the function signature intact. reply cowl 10 hours agorootparentAnd I see no Harm on making this extreme wierd usecase less user-friendly and force you to go through panic recover rather than force everyone else that will never get errors to handle errors. reply fsociety 19 hours agoparentprevIf it panics, you discover it instantly and can fix. If it didn’t panic, you could unknowingly deploy and rely on behavior you did not know about until it is an issue. reply koito17 10 hours agoparentprevThis comment is interesting to me, because in Clojure there is a data-driven routing library called Reitit, and by default it will refuse to compile conflicting routes unless you explicitly tag the conflicting routes as conflicting. So Golang&#x27;s new behavior is more intuitive to me than the current behavior.I have also ran into situations where I needed a routing tree like [[\"&#x2F;foo&#x2F;bar\"] [\"&#x2F;foo&#x2F;:id\"]]but it&#x27;s better IMO for routing libraries to force the user to acknowledge they are introducing conflicting routes rather than silently resolve conflicts. That way the user is forced to understand the behavior of the router. reply vlunkr 14 hours agoparentprevI feel conflicted on it. I&#x27;ve abused routes in that way, but I&#x27;ve also been confused or encountered bugs because I didn&#x27;t notice the conflict. reply lucb1e 16 hours agoparentprevI would have expected the last one to override the first when registering routes. That seems to be the behavior I see most (not specific to web servers).Given opposite expectations, erroring out makes sense, but a panic? Does that mean it crashes the whole web server when a client first accesses it, when you launch the server, or does it return a 500 to the client? reply greiskul 15 hours agorootparentWhen you launch the server. Idea is that you want to catch errors as early as possible in the development process, and by crashing the server, the programmer that wrote it will catch it. reply Cupprum 20 hours agoprevThe gorrila&#x2F;mux project is weird and I am confused by it.

Now as i saw the OP mentioning it in their blog, i went to take a look at the gorrila&#x2F;mux project again to verify i correctly remembered the project to be archived. Apparently its not archived anymore, which brings the stability of the whole project to the question, or maybe it proves that Open Source is actually very stable.

I think it&#x27;s pretty much obvious what it does even if one never sees the documentation.And given that `Method` is either one of a few predefined constants or `extension-method = token`, and `token` excludes whitespace, slashes and all sort of brackets I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a chance of confusion or misparsing there, even for weirdest custom methods. reply cheriot 15 hours agorootparent> And given that `Method` is either one of a few predefined constantsThe compiler via a method call or parameter can capture this constraint in a pretty straight forward way.

It not like HTTP verbs are going to change anytime soon, and it’s trivial to validate them during register, or via static analysis.

Having used Go for 10 years now, next to other popular languages like JS and Python, I think it squarely falls into the \"more type-safe than not\" half of the spectrum.

So I&#x27;d be fine with having static analysis warn about bad syntax personally.For what it&#x27;s worth, though, in my opinion, you probably shouldn&#x27;t use the default serve mux if you already have advanced needs; there are plenty of options out there that are more suitable to different use cases, and if you&#x27;re already doing dynamic route generation, it may wind up being less effort to just write your own router rather than try to munge whatever data structures you have into an existing router&#x27;s. reply donatj 20 hours agoprevI would far rather the overlapping path’s just match in the order they were defined rather than panic.In their example here, had they defined the `&#x2F;task&#x2F;0&#x2F;{action}&#x2F;` path before the wildcard path, my expectation would have been for that to match first. This would allow for handlers for special cases to easily be defined.I’d far rather things just do what I say than fail in “helpful” ways. Smells really funny and not very Go. reply numbsafari 20 hours agoparentExcept the semantics of the language matter, and it is, actually, very Go.The original ServeMux was designed to not honor registration order, because it is risky to do so. One of the key design goals of Go is to support \"programming at scale\", and odd side-effects due to edits made to \"distant code\" is the exact kind of thing you want to avoid.In trivial examples, where all of the registrations are made in a single function in a single package, there is clarity around the intention of registration order. But you can&#x27;t assume that that is how these things will always happen. In fact, for any sufficiently large codebase, these registrations will likely be happening in more than one location, and may be the result of reading input files or generated code where the person writing the spec for the generated code is unaware of the intricacies of execution order and how that may impact routing. It also means that changing the lexical sort of a set of package imports could result in an unexpected change in routing.Avoid unexpected results, making refactoring easier, and generally trying to make a complex program easier to reason about, are definitely very Go. You might not always agree with their choices, but those are their reasons and they are remarkably consistent. reply iudqnolq 17 hours agorootparentWhy even allow registrations at a distance?

The particular bits that it happens to provide by \"default\" are not really that consequential by comparison. I was actually surprised anyone touched the standard mux at all at this late date because there&#x27;s so many other options already, and most of them just plug in with no fuss at all.

I&#x27;ve worked on codebases that use each of those patterns, and I greatly prefer those where all of the routes (and ideally the auth middleware too) are defined in a single top-level routes file.IMO it makes it much easier to get an overview of the overall functionality of the app, and to find the code which implements each route. It&#x27;s also a lot more flexible if you ever need to support routes which do not fit the conventional pattern of the framework (perhaps for legacy reasons).You can of course still use dependency injection, etc with this central route registration model. reply shortrounddev2 16 hours agorootparentI can understand that view, but I like to have the controller class files themselves represent the site hierarchy. Rather than looking in a file for the appropriate route, I look through the filesystem to understand the routing. I expect FooController to map to &#x2F;foo (or &#x2F;api&#x2F;foo or whatever). I worked on a django project which did all the routing in a single location and it frequently resulted in merge conflicts between multiple developers committing changes to the file about the same time reply bborud 15 hours agorootparentprev> is how you get hundreds of poorly written spaghetti codeSo what you are saying is that the IoC &#x2F; Decorator approach is the way to avoid spaghetti code?

How is the second example better in any way?You&#x27;re also doing more in your second example. You can still do service injection in JavaScript. reply shortrounddev2 18 hours agorootparentThe 2nd example:1. Uses declarative routing, which looks better and makes more sense than running a function to handle routing (e.g, you read it as \"There is a handler named GetFoo living within the Foo controller that exists at the base route\"). Declaration is more important to the end user than implementation when creating an interface. It also allows you to export these classes to a different Main method which can generate documentation for you without having to even run the HTTP server (the declarations can be picked up using RTTI and not actually having the runtime server activated). You can also add named parameters to the routes and then add them to the body of the handler with their proper types, e.g: [HttpGet(\"&#x2F;{id}\")] public ActionResult GetFoo(int id)And that input validation is handled automatically. Named parameters exist on a lot of these frameworks as well, but Javascript doesn&#x27;t provide static typing so it&#x27;s not a good language for writing a backend in2. Handles input validation under the hood or through middleware so you don&#x27;t have to manage it in the controller body3. Can also handle user auth under the hood using attributes so you don&#x27;t have to handle it in the controller body4. Uses middleware to handle routing in a predictable way (e.g: the name of the controller is the name of the route by default)5. Uses class-based controllers to encapsulate the services available to the controller through the constructor, and also helps pair a single model to a single controller for making really simple RESTful interfacesYou can also define a custom controller interface or abstract class which provides a bunch of default functionality that you commonly re-use (e.g: ApiController with some built in response wrappers&#x2F;handlers for error codes, etc.) reply avianlyric 15 hours agorootparent> And that input validation is handled automatically. Named parameters exist on a lot of these frameworks as well, but Javascript doesn&#x27;t provide static typing so it&#x27;s not a good language for writing a backend inGod the number of bugs and bad practices I&#x27;ve had to deal with and work around do to auto-magic casting of url segments, or JSON blobs into language native types, is too damn high. Auto input validation based on function parameter types sounds good, until you think about for more than a couple of seconds and start to realise type primitives definitions vary significantly between languages. Using them for input validation just means exporting your languages type primitives into your API, with zero consideration of if that&#x27;s a good idea.The classic example of this is people using the `int` type for `id`s just because the IDs happen to contain only digits. Ignoring the fact that identifiers aren&#x27;t numbers (performing numeric operations on them doesn&#x27;t make any sense), but because you&#x27;ve now blindly exported the `int` type into your API, you also export nastiness like precision (try preserving leading zeros with your `int` type) and rollovers into your API. Two things that make zero sense when dealing with identifiers, and two things that often change depending on the exact platform your software is running on. reply dimgl 13 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re making these statements as if the example you&#x27;re presenting is the only one of its kind that has these properties. It&#x27;s simply not the case. You can use middleware in other frameworks just as well. You can do input validation in other frameworks just as well. You can also class-based route handler encapsulation in other languages just as well. And I&#x27;d argue it looks _significantly_ cleaner than whatever is going on in ASP.NET land.I&#x27;d really encourage you to explore other languages. If you&#x27;re one of those \"JavaScript is bad\" people, there&#x27;s plenty of others: Go, Ruby, Python... I&#x27;m surprised to be seeing this kind of comment on Hacker News to be honest. reply neonsunset 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is straight up wrong.

I personally prefer using MinApi style of declaration (first example). It can do request validation, model binding and inject services too: app.MapGet(\"&#x2F;\", async ( [FromBody] User user, [FromServices] MyService service) => { await service.Handle(user); return Results.Ok(); }); reply shortrounddev2 17 hours agorootparentI might consider this for a very small service, but not for anything with a lot of controllers or services. When you get to the point where your backend is managing several workflows with dozens of views, dozens of models, and each with its own service, it becomes nice to be able to put these things in classes.I also dislike functions and controllers without explicitly defined return types. reply conor- 12 hours agorootparentYou can write a method that uses IEndpointRouteBuilder for creating a route group so that you can split up your routes by object domain or into separate classes or however you want to.Then you add an extensions method for WebApplication that registers all of your route groups when configuring your app pipeline. Each time you create a new route group, you add that group to your WebApplication extension method and it&#x27;s wired up.It&#x27;s a little extra work up-front when you&#x27;re first creating your app, but it also results in a clearer structure for how routes are defined once the app grows into the size you&#x27;re describing. reply KomoD 18 hours agoparentprevI like #1, I don&#x27;t like #2 whatsoever reply ramesh31 18 hours agoparentprev> This has always seemed way more maintainable to me.

Try declaratively validating user input in Javascript or Typescript without having to rely on some kind of runtime hack or re-writing the same code over and over.If you were to decide to ditch express and move to a different framework, then the way you have written your express handlers would also have to be totally discarded.

This kind of design approach usually results in a red flag if a major part of the valuation is the codebase.I question your judgment if using a well documented and not at all obscure framework based on some of the most popular frameworks out there (MVC style, bootstrap, etc.) raises a red flag. It would indicate, to me, your lack of experience in writing or reading code rather than anything about the framework itself.

The more of you application is affected by the framework, the more expensive it is to move away from it. This is an important reason why the Go community tends to discourage creation and use of large frameworks.I can understand that you are defensive if you have spent years making this investment and someone suggests you have made a poor choice.

This day in history: 2003, 2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Leaving Twitter had no effect on NPR's traffic (permalink) Enshittification is the process by which a platform lures in and then captures end users (stage one), who serve as bait for business customers, who are also captured (stage two), whereupon the platform rug-pulls both groups and allocates all the value they generate and exchange to itself (stage three): https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys Enshittification isn't merely a form of rent-seeking – it is a uniquely digital phenomenon, because it relies on the inherent flexibility of digital systems. There are lots of intermediaries that want to extract surpluses from customers and suppliers – everyone from grocers to oil companies – but these can't be reconfigured in an eyeblink the way that purely digital services can. A sleazy boss can hide their wage-theft with a bunch of confusing deductions to your paycheck. But when your boss is an app, it can engage in algorithmic wage discrimination, where your pay declines minutely every time you accept a job, but if you start to decline jobs, the app can raise the offer: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men I call this process \"twiddling\": tech platforms are equipped with a million knobs on their back-ends, and platform operators can endlessly twiddle those knobs, altering the business logic from moment to moment, turning the system into an endlessly shifting quagmire where neither users nor business customers can ever be sure whether they're getting a fair deal: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ Social media platforms are compulsive twiddlers. They use endless variation to lure in – and then lock in – publishers, with the goal of converting these standalone businesses into commodity suppliers who are dependent on the platform, who can then be charged rent to reach the users who asked to hear from them. Facebook designed this playbook. First, it lured in end-users by promising them a good deal: \"Unlike Myspace, which spies on you from asshole to appetite, Facebook is a privacy-respecting site that will never, ever spy on you. Simply sign up, tell us everyone who matters to you, and we'll populate a feed with everything they post for public consumption\": https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876 The users came, and locked themselves in: when people gather in social spaces, they inadvertently take one another hostage. You joined Facebook because you liked the people who were there, then others joined because they liked you. Facebook can now make life worse for all of you without losing your business. You might hate Facebook, but you like each other, and the collective action problem of deciding when and whether to go, and where you should go next, is so difficult to overcome, that you all stay in a place that's getting progressively worse. Once its users were locked in, Facebook turned to advertisers and said, \"Remember when we told these rubes we'd never spy on them? It was a lie. We spy on them with every hour that God sends, and we'll sell you access to that data in the form of dirt-cheap targeted ads.\" Then Facebook went to the publishers and said, \"Remember when we told these suckers that we'd only show them the things they asked to see? Total lie. Post short excerpts from your content and links back to your websites and we'll nonconsensually cram them into the eyeballs of people who never asked to see them. It's a free, high-value traffic funnel for your own site, bringing monetizable users right to your door.\" Now, Facebook had to find a way to lock in those publishers. To do this, it had to twiddle. By tiny increments, Facebook deprioritized publishers' content, forcing them to make their excerpts grow progressively longer. As with gig workers, the digital flexibility of Facebook gave it lots of leeway here. Some publishers sensed the excerpts they were being asked to post were a substitute for visiting their sites – and not an enticement – and drew down their posting to Facebook. When that happened, Facebook could twiddle in the publisher's favor, giving them broader distribution for shorter excerpts, then, once the publisher returned to the platform, Facebook drew down their traffic unless they started posting longer pieces. Twiddling lets platforms play users and business-customers like a fish on a line, giving them slack when they fight, then reeling them in when they tire. Once Facebook converted a publisher to a commodity supplier to the platform, it reeled the publishers in. First, it deprioritized publishers' posts when they had links back to the publisher's site (under the pretext of policing \"clickbait\" and \"malicious links\"). Then, it stopped showing publishers' content to their own subscribers, extorting them to pay to \"boost\" their posts in order to reach people who had explicitly asked to hear from them. For users, this meant that their feeds were increasingly populated with payola-boosted content from advertisers and pay-to-play publishers who paid Facebook's Danegeld to reach them. A user will only spend so much time on Facebook, and every post that Facebook feeds that user from someone they want to hear from is a missed opportunity to show them a post from someone who'll pay to reach them. Here, too, twiddling lets Facebook fine-tune its approach. If a user starts to wean themself off Facebook, the algorithm (TM) can put more content the user has asked to see in the feed. When the user's participation returns to higher levels, Facebook can draw down the share of desirable content again, replacing it with monetizable content. This is done minutely, behind the scenes, automatically, and quickly. In any shell game, the quickness of the hand deceives the eye. This is the final stage of enshittification: withdrawing surpluses from end-users and business customers, leaving behind the minimum homeopathic quantum of value for each needed to keep them locked to the platform, generating value that can be extracted and diverted to platform shareholders. But this is a brittle equilibrium to maintain. The difference between \"God, I hate this place but I just can't leave it\" and \"Holy shit, this sucks, I'm outta here\" is razor-thin. All it takes is one privacy scandal, one livestreamed mass-shooting, one whistleblower dump, and people bolt for the exits. This kicks off a death-spiral: as users and business customers leave, the platform's shareholders demand that they squeeze the remaining population harder to make up for the loss. One reason this gambit worked so well is that it was a long con. Platform operators and their investors have been willing to throw away billions convincing end-users and business customers to lock themselves in until it was time for the pig-butchering to begin. They financed expensive forays into additional features and complementary products meant to increase user lock-in, raising the switching costs for users who were tempted to leave. For example, Facebook's product manager for its \"photos\" product wrote to Mark Zuckerberg to lay out a strategy of enticing users into uploading valuable family photos to the platform in order to \"make switching costs very high for users,\" who would have to throw away their precious memories as the price for leaving Facebook: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs The platforms' patience paid off. Their slow ratchets operated so subtly that we barely noticed the squeeze, and when we did, they relaxed the pressure until we were lulled back into complacency. Long cons require a lot of prefrontal cortex, the executive function to exercise patience and restraint. Which brings me to Elon Musk, a man who seems to have been born without a prefrontal cortex, who has repeatedly and publicly demonstrated that he lacks any restraint, patience or planning. Elon Musk's prefrontal cortical deficit resulted in his being forced to buy Twitter, and his every action since has betrayed an even graver inability to stop tripping over his own dick. Where Zuckerberg played enshittification as a long game, Musk is bent on speedrunning it. He doesn't slice his users up with a subtle scalpel, he hacks away at them with a hatchet. Musk inaugurated his reign by nonconsensually flipping every user to an algorithmic feed which was crammed with ads and posts from \"verified\" users whose blue ticks verified solely that they had $8 ($11 for iOS users). Where Facebook deployed substantial effort to enticing users who tired of eyeball-cramming feed decay by temporarily improving their feeds, Musk's Twitter actually overrode users' choice to switch back to a chronological feed by repeatedly flipping them back to more monetizable, algorithmic feeds. Then came the squeeze on publishers. Musk's Twitter rolled out a bewildering array of \"verification\" ticks, each priced higher than the last, and publishers who refused to pay found their subscribers taken hostage, with Twitter downranking or shadowbanning their content unless they paid. (Musk also squeezed advertisers, keeping the same high prices but reducing the quality of the offer by killing programs that kept advertisers' content from being published along Holocaust denial and open calls for genocide.) Today, Musk continues to squeeze advertisers, publishers and users, and his hamfisted enticements to make up for these depredations are spectacularly bad, and even illegal, like offering advertisers a new kind of ad that isn't associated with any Twitter account, can't be blocked, and is not labeled as an ad: https://www.wired.com/story/xs-sneaky-new-ads-might-be-illegal/ Of course, Musk has a compulsive bullshitter's contempt for the press, so he has far fewer enticements for them to stay. Quite the reverse: first, Musk removed headlines from link previews, rendering posts by publishers that went to their own sites into stock-art enigmas that generated no traffic: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/05/x-twitter-strips-headlines-new-links-why-elon-musk Then he jumped straight to the end-stage of enshittification by announcing that he would shadowban any newsmedia posts with links to sites other than Twitter, \"because there is less time spent if people click away.\" Publishers were advised to \"post content in long form on this platform\": https://mamot.fr/@pluralistic/111183068362793821 Where a canny enshittifier would have gestured at a gaslighting explanation (\"we're shadowbanning posts with links because they might be malicious\"), Musk busts out the motto of the Darth Vader MBA: \"I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.\" All this has the effect of highlighting just how little residual value there is on the platform for publishers, and tempts them to bolt for the exits. Six months ago, NPR lost all patience with Musk's shenanigans, and quit the service. Half a year later, they've revealed how low the switching cost for a major news outlet that leaves Twitter really are: NPR's traffic, post-Twitter, has declined by less than a single percentage point: https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/ NPR's Twitter accounts had 8.7 million followers, but even six months ago, Musk's enshittification speedrun had drawn down NPR's ability to reach those users to a negligible level. The 8.7 million number was an illusion, a shell game Musk played on publishers like NPR in a bid to get them to buy a five-figure iridium checkmark or even a six-figure titanium one. On Twitter, the true number of followers you have is effectively zero – not because Twitter users haven't explicitly instructed the service to show them your posts, but because every post in their feeds that they want to see is a post that no one can be charged to show them. I've experienced this myself. Three and a half years ago, I left Boing Boing and started pluralistic.net, my cross-platform, open access, surveillance-free, daily newsletter and blog: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three Boing Boing had the good fortune to have attracted a sizable audience before the advent of siloed platforms, and a large portion of that audience came to the site directly, rather than following us on social media. I knew that, starting a new platform from scratch, I wouldn't have that luxury. My audience would come from social media, and it would be up to me to convert readers into people who followed me on platforms I controlled – where neither they nor I could be held to ransom. I embraced a strategy called POSSE: Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere. With POSSE, the permalink and native habitat for your material is a site you control (in my case, a WordPress blog with all the telemetry, logging and surveillance disabled). Then you repost that content to other platforms – mostly social media – with links back to your own site: https://indieweb.org/POSSE There are a lot of automated tools to help you with this, but the platforms have gone to great lengths to break or neuter them. Musk's attack on Twitter's legendarily flexible and powerful API killed every automation tool that might help with this. I was lucky enough to have a reader – Loren Kohnfelder – who coded me some python scripts that automate much of the process, but POSSE remains a very labor-intensive and error-prone methodology: https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd And of all the feeds I produce – email, RSS, Discourse, Medium, Tumblr, Mastodon – none is as labor-intensive as Twitter's. It is an unforgiving medium to begin with, and Musk's drawdown of engineering support has made it wildly unreliable. Many's the time I've set up 20+ posts in a thread, only to have the browser tab reload itself and wipe out all my work. But I stuck with Twitter, because I have a half-million followers, and to the extent that I reach them there, I can hope that they will follow the permalinks to Pluralistic proper and switch over to RSS, or email, or a daily visit to the blog. But with each day, the case for using Twitter grows weaker. I get ten times as many replies and reposts on Mastodon, though my Mastodon follower count is a tenth the size of my (increasingly hypothetical) Twitter audience. All this raises the question of what can or should be done about Twitter. One possible regulatory response would be to impose an \"End-To-End\" rule on the service, requiring that Twitter deliver posts from willing senders to willing receivers without interfering in them. End-To-end is the bedrock of the internet (one of its incarnations is Net Neutrality) and it's a proven counterenshittificatory force: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/save-news-we-need-end-end-web Despite what you may have heard, \"freedom of reach\" is freedom of speech: when a platform interposes itself between willing speakers and their willing audiences, it arrogates to itself the power to control what we're allowed to say and who is allowed to hear us: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen We have a wide variety of tools to make a rule like this stick. For one thing, Musk's Twitter has violated innumerable laws and consent decrees in the US, Canada and the EU, which creates a space for regulators to impose \"conduct remedies\" on the company. But there's also existing regulatory authorities, like the FTC's Section Five powers, which enable the agency to act against companies that engage in \"unfair and deceptive\" acts. When Twitter asks you who you want to hear from, then refuses to deliver their posts to you unless they pay a bribe, that's both \"unfair and deceptive\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge But that's only a stopgap. The problem with Twitter isn't that this important service is run by the wrong mercurial, mediocre billionaire: it's that hundreds of millions of people are at the mercy of any foolish corporate leader. While there's a short-term case for improving the platforms, our long-term strategy should be evacuating them: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens To make that a reality, we could also impose a \"Right To Exit\" on the platforms. This would be an interoperability rule that would require Twitter to adopt Mastodon's approach to server-hopping: click a link to export the list of everyone who follows you on one server, click another link to upload that file to another server, and all your followers and followees are relocated to your new digs: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies A Twitter with the Right To Exit would exert a powerful discipline even on the stunted self-regulatory centers of Elon Musk's brain. If he banned a reporter for publishing truthful coverage that cast him in a bad light, that reporter would have the legal right to move to another platform, and continue to reach the people who follow them on Twitter. Publishers aghast at having the headlines removed from their Twitter posts could go somewhere less slipshod and still reach the people who want to hear from them on Twitter. And both Right To Exit and End-To-End satisfy the two prime tests for sound internet regulation: first, they are easy to administer. If you want to know whether Musk is permitting harassment on his platform, you have to agree on a definition of harassment, determine whether a given act meets that definition, and then investigate whether Twitter took reasonable steps to prevent it. By contrast, administering End-To-End merely requires that you post something and see if your followers receive it. Administering Right To Exit is as simple as saying, \"OK, Twitter, I know you say you gave Cory his follower and followee file, but he says he never got it. Just send him another copy, and this time, CC the regulator so we can verify that it arrived.\" Beyond administration, there's the cost of compliance. Requiring Twitter to police its users' conduct also requires it to hire an army of moderators – something that Elon Musk might be able to afford, but community-supported, small federated servers couldn't. A tech regulation can easily become a barrier to entry, blocking better competitors who might replace the company whose conduct spurred the regulation in the first place. End-to-End does not present this kind of barrier. The default state for a social media platform is to deliver posts from accounts to their followers. Interfering with End-To-End costs more than delivering the messages users want to have. Likewise, a Right To Exit is a solved problem, built into the open Mastodon protocol, itself built atop the open ActivityPub standard. It's not just Twitter. Every platform is consuming itself in an orgy of enshittification. This is the Great Enshittening, a moment of universal, end-stage platform decay. As the platforms burn, calls to address the fires grow louder and harder for policymakers to resist. But not all solutions to platform decay are created equal. Some solutions will perversely enshrine the dominance of platforms, help make them both too big to fail and too big to jail. Musk has flagrantly violated so many rules, laws and consent decrees that he has accidentally turned Twitter into the perfect starting point for a program of platform reform and platform evacuation.

All of NPRs articles presumably get posted into Twitter by someone noteworthy, and that tweet is what goes viral (if any), not the one from their main account.Now that Musk has recently changed the way unfurls work, I would imagine that definitely affected their traffic.Doctorow has had a chip on his shoulder about Musk for a while now and I would be happy to go out on a limb predicting that any theories he has about Twitter&#x27;s demise won&#x27;t age well. The reason Twitter works is because of network effects, and those network effects are a function of Metcalfe&#x27;s Law, not the presence or absence of a single account on the platform. Being part of the web, Twitter&#x27;s network effects are intertwined with the web and their social graph. That&#x27;s about it. The way to know if Twitter is going down in flames is the degree to which Musk breaks the network effects of the web, or if the exodus from the platform turns into some kind of positive feedback loop. Musk seems much more willing to mess with the former than the latter. (Much of the recent changes are about increasing users and time on site) reply parl_match 13 hours agoparent> The reason Twitter works is because of network effectsEntire niche and hobbyist communities I&#x27;m in have left Twitter almost entirely.

I do think Twitter is bound to fall off if it hasn&#x27;t already, though. The value it provides is too easily copied by others in my opinion, and the actual incentive to participate in it is dwindling. I&#x27;ve never made a Twitter account, and today it has never looked less appealing from the outside-in. Even if the premium features were free!I can believe that certain people are bought-in on Twitter for the long-haul. But social networks are dynamic, and after a while we&#x27;re going to see the effects of a worse client, less dependable web app and weaker hosting architecture. Even if Elon isn&#x27;t a destructive force internally (ha ha), the changes have already soured it for a lot of people. Twitter&#x27;s existence is based on a delicate precipice of advertising and free content. You can&#x27;t change the deal and expect everyone to be on board going forward.Imagine if Hacker News made the same changes, do you think it&#x27;s audience would stick around? I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.

Instead of listening to user concerns or fixing the apps, they&#x27;ve decided to incentivize popular users to stay active. It&#x27;s not a draw for newcomers, who&#x27;d pay $8 a month for every $0.20 they earn. It&#x27;s not a draw to developers, who now pay out the ass to access their platform. It&#x27;s a \"you&#x27;re locked in here with me!\" play that doesn&#x27;t bode well for the treatment of users. reply KerrAvon 12 hours agorootparentprevOther social networks are pretty happy to not to have the people he&#x27;s actually paying, seems to be a bizarre collection of accused rapists and right-wing trolls. reply gfodor 10 hours agorootparentIt’s anyone who gets meaningful verified account impressions. There are probably tens of thousands of such accounts. replyj_maffe 13 hours agoparentprevI think the takeaway isn&#x27;t that Twitter doesn&#x27;t cause traffic to webpages, just businesses and journalists having their own accounts not affected said traffic. reply gnicholas 13 hours agorootparentIf you look at the underlying data, described in the linked NiemanReports article, it shows that Twitter-sourced traffic dropped by over 50%. It&#x27;s just that NPR&#x27;s Twitter-sourced traffic only comprised 2% of their total traffic before the change, so getting rid of their account only dropped it by 1% overall (though that was 50% of their total Twitter-sourced traffic).So it might not have made much of an impact for NPR (though no publisher wants to lose 1% of traffic), but for a publisher with more traffic coming from Twitter shouldn&#x27;t nuke their account, thinking that it won&#x27;t matter for them either. reply zwieback 14 hours agoprevI never understood why journalists loved Twitter so much, as it turns out they were writing for each other the whole time and the general public didn&#x27;t really care. reply chaps 13 hours agoparentJournalist here -- you&#x27;re missing a lot of the point. There are bunches of reasons. Basically it&#x27;s near impossible to have a journalism career without being on Twitter. For network&#x2F;sources building, the ease of access to peers (ever try to find a journalist&#x27;s unlisted email address?), and it acts as a way to show your \"brand\" that can make intros much easier (reputation is built on trust, so Twitter can be useful to convey that a person is relatively trustworthy and quickly). A lot of journalists will also share information that got cut out during editing (not many alternatives to host that sort of side-narrative and docs stuff). Also, there&#x27;s a lot of proximity to orgs (eg nonprofits) who themselves have eyes and ears outside of Twitter.That said, my experience is in local municipal stuff and a lot of this is no longer true because of musk shit. reply marcosdumay 13 hours agorootparentSo... You confirm that you are writing for each other.If it&#x27;s like a liked-in account for developers, it explains very clearly why journalists use it so much. But this is not the use people claim to get from the platform. On that account, linked-in is way more honest. reply chaps 12 hours agorootparentNo. Like another poster posted, it&#x27;s more like github. It&#x27;s hard to overstate the sharing of information, code and documents that happens on twitter.Side note: it&#x27;s a very strange thing to read a comment like this from someone who puts their multiple websites in their profile not unlike a resume. reply firecall 12 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t have to be a negative thing though.Journalists on Twitter is totally OK as a community that is Tweeting at each other for the benefit of their own networking and community.That’s not a bad thing :-) reply marcosdumay 12 hours agorootparentprevOk, github is indeed closer to what you said.Still, we use github to talk to each other. Not to the public. When news companies talk about posting things on twitter, they always talk about reaching the public, and when journalists quote it, they use it as if it came from the general public.There&#x27;s nothing wrong with journalists talking with each other. What&#x27;s unsettling is that you almost unanimously claim you are using the platform in a completely different way. (And apparently honestly believe that claim.) reply chaps 12 hours agorootparentLook man, you&#x27;re not going to get a perfect comparison anywhere. But your problems with quoting twitter is something I agree with! But as it turns out, different people within the same profession have different standards of what they publish on.

He’s explained why that isn’t the case. reply bparsons 13 hours agorootparentprevI think this was true a while back, but the ecosystem on Twitter is basically destroyed.There was a period between 2010-2020 when Twitter was truly the main convergence of entertainment, media, political and financial commentators. It was the place to be seen.It doesn&#x27;t seem to really exist anymore. These different verticals have been scattered all throughout the internet. It is an increasingly small number of people who simply hang around there for the little dopamine hit they get when they see the notification.Most political and corporate communications strategies have diversified away from Twitter because it is a sinking ship. This started before Elon took the helm, but he has certainly accelerated its demise.

I don&#x27;t think humanity has seen anything like it, except maybe when print media was the only way to get news, where pubs and town criers would spread information and you might get a chance to \"mob\" a politician or leader in the streets to get a few answers out of them that the newspapers wouldn&#x27;t print. reply moomoo11 13 hours agorootparentprevSo you just proved their point? Or is this indicative of journalism just kinda going under where you basically deny what someone said only to bolster their point.You basically said it is to feel important (your branding, whatever) amongst your peers.The general public doesn&#x27;t care, you do though (what the person you&#x27;re replying to said, and basically what you just reiterated). As a member of the general public that doesn&#x27;t use twitter (I use nitter to view twitter, and I won&#x27;t call it X), I feel that it is a massive echo chamber amplified by bots and fake engagement numbers. reply chaps 13 hours agorootparentOi mate calm down, hey?You&#x27;re twisting every aspect of my post to the point of satire.

Assuming at Twitter someone post the news at T+1 second as they happen, because you can&#x27;t report news before they actually happened (unless your newspaper is called Tomorrow). The question then - are \"old\" newspapers really reporting major news with 24 hour delay (online)? Does ANY newspaper work with such delay?I honestly don&#x27;t remember a single case when something big happens in the world today, I go to the \"old\" news site the same day and that event is not reported.Maybe some obscure regional politic events are reported with delay (even that is debatable), but why would you want some urgent news about obscure regional stuff?

It&#x27;s just not cool to hang out there any more, at least for some interest groups. reply slantedview 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s becoming less so. During the start of the war in Gaza, many journalists lamented how terrible Twitter has become for the thing it was best at: breaking news. There are many problems, but one of them is that intentionally misleading blue check accounts are boosted above actual journalists.

See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allsides.com&#x2F;news-source&#x2F;slate. I&#x27;d take that article with a heavy grain of salt. They also use two data points of failed moderation (not a lack of moderation) and try to paint the entire platform based on it. That happened plenty under the old regime as well.If the actual journalists paid for the blue checkmark, that&#x27;d solve the issue wouldn&#x27;t it?Twitter prior to Musk was a sinking ship (cancel culture exaggerated the problem). Asking people to pay is one of the attempts to solve that problem. If a journalist is unwilling to pay, they&#x27;re going to be deprioritized and can&#x27;t really complain about it. But Twitter has been very open and transparent about the need to reduce bots by paying for the checkmark. reply nvm0n2 1 hour agorootparentprev> intentionally misleading blue check accounts are boosted above actual journalistsActual journalists are often blue ticks and intentionally misleading so this is as pot&#x2F;kettle&#x2F;black situation if there ever was one. reply sangnoir 14 hours agorootparentprevTwitter is - now more than ever - also the first place for eyewitness accounts for things that didn&#x27;t happen.

This tweet by Monica Lewinsky really wouldn&#x27;t have landed without that verified mark! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;MonicaLewinsky&#x2F;status&#x2F;115034806144255180...Unfortunately, Musk apparently had the same cynical opinion of this that you have, and threw the entire thing away.

It may be that I&#x27;ve just been noticing it more, but it seems more common lately.Perfection of any kind does not exist in the physical world, so any test against perfection will fail - it&#x27;s simply a matter of phrasing to choose what you want to identify as failing.The test isn&#x27;t whether All or Every such-and-such meets some test, it&#x27;s the current state (do many or most meet the test?) and the direction (are more or fewer meeting the test?) that matters. reply slantedview 14 hours agorootparentprevTurns out that democratizing blue checkmarks solved one problem, but created another, in that it became much harder to vet reliable information on twitter, and intentionally misleading tweets would be boosted above those from professional journalists. The gaza war has been a flood of misinformation and spam. Community notes seems to be mostly good, but is utterly incapable of keeping up with the flood of misinformation.And so, overall, taking away blue checkmarks from professionals and giving them to spammers has been a net loss for Twitter, at least for those of us who appreciate good information. reply goldenchrome 14 hours agorootparentprevX has a ton of cultural impact today—it’s just that the audience has shifted from neoliberal to classical liberal&#x2F;libertarian.

While true in theory, in practice, it turns out professional journalists are more reliable, which has led to people going elsewhere.Even if Twitter got it wrong with blue checks sometimes, by and large, the old approach led to a platform that was a vastly more reliable source of information than the cesspool we have today. reply simonw 13 hours agorootparentprevVerification didn&#x27;t mean \"this person is worth listening to and this person is not\".It was a signal that you could use as part of your own evaluation of what was worth paying attention to.It had nothing to do with whether or not something was true.The fact that some said some wild thing - true or not - is still an interesting piece of information, when the verification process demonstrates that it really IS that person saying that thing. reply nvm0n2 1 hour agorootparentOriginally that was true, but as Twitter got ever more woke it stopped meaning that and became blurred with endorsement. From Wikipedia:Twitter faced backlash in November 2017 when it verified the account of Jason Kessler, a neo-Nazi and white supremacist. The backlash forced Twitter to pause its verification program.[9] Several days later, Twitter removed Spencer and Kessler&#x27;s verification statuses.[10] Likewise, Twitter had removed verification from Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos for violating its policies in January, signaling Twitter verification implied endorsement. reply rsynnott 12 hours agorootparentprev… Wait, what did you think the verification was _for_?

Although I suspect that 2% represents the nadir, and earlier changes to Twitter drove the number down to that.But overall this topic is mostly just two people using a single line in a memo (a memo not confirmed by NPR but I suspect it’s true and exists) to go on at tiresome length about things they wanted an excuse to complain about.

Maybe it happens less because Twitter users might have followed the official account and then seen and retweeted more stuff.

But it means that other publishers shouldn&#x27;t hastily delete their Twitter accounts, thinking that their traffic won&#x27;t drop materially.

    "commentBody": "FreeTube – The Private YouTube ClientHacker NewspastloginFreeTube – The Private YouTube Client (github.com/freetubeapp) 299 points by akyuu 23 hours ago| hidepastfavorite388 comments scbzzzzz 21 hours agoI see there is lot of dilemma in comments here regarding blocking ads. blocking ads is not piracy, blocking ads should be norm. I am ok with seeing ads, until they don&#x27;t track my behavior, they don&#x27;t try to manipulate my decisions based on age,region,sex,location, earning status. I am \"ok\" with ads shown in TV channels, because they show the same for all above mentioned categories.let me make a simple analogy, how do you feel if a circus publicizes as free, has a billboard to show ads, and in background they hires a detective to follow your every move 24&#x2F;7 , note down your interests&#x2F;dislikes so they can show you personalised ads based on the interests. creepy right, That how i feel these companies do.just because someone&#x2F;company spent money and posted a billboard on public space, doesn&#x27;t mean you have to read through it. It is the risk they assumed, just like youtube&#x2F;creators made the decision to host videos for free on a public space. it is a bad decision from their part and they have to live with it and not gaslight people.I hate to see youtube die, It is a wonderful archive for society. if you want you can buy premium&#x2F;see ads so that society wont lose some thing valuable. but not because of creators&#x2F;YT losing revenue.(that&#x27;s the risk they assumed when they started the business).and then there are people who say, you can turn off ad personalization, I did since last 5 years and you know what I see. Some Scam apps&#x2F;NSFW ads content. and there is no way to report the ads unless I turn on ad personalization.I would like to repeat statement from louis rossmann , don&#x27;t accept the premise of the corporates when the premise itself is shaky. reply Draiken 19 hours agoparentOne aspect you didn&#x27;t mention is the ability to not look at the ad billboard.If I see a giant ad billboard, I can not look at it, look away, close my eyes, block it with my hands, etc. In a distant future I&#x27;d buy glasses that blur ads from my sight (if that could be done without a company seeing everything I see).For me ad-blockers are the same with some automation. It&#x27;s a way for me to not give up my time and attention for something I never asked for in the first place.Moves like this one from YouTube are one step closer to that dystopian nightmare depicted in Black Mirror where you have to watch the ad no matter what. You close your eyes, and the ad pauses and only goes away after you finish watching it. It&#x27;s absolutely insane.We somehow got gaslighted into believing there&#x27;s something good with advertising and there are just a few \"bad actors\" (where did I hear that before?). I firmly disagree. The entire world would be a better place without ads. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 17 hours agorootparentTo add another example,I arrive late to the movie theater, I&#x27;ll arrive anywhere from 15-30 minutes late.why?Because I paid to watch a movie, I did not pay to watch advertisements of movies. There&#x27;s typically 15-30 minutes of ads in front of movies nowadays.When I was younger I didn&#x27;t have this policy because there were far fewer ads, but they keep cramming more and more. reply aequitas 17 hours agorootparentYouTube use to have a single pre roll of just a handful of seconds. Now there are multiple which take 10 seconds each, unskippable and also ads on top of the video an in between segments. They have just become to greedy, like a Pythagorean cup, take too much and you will end up having nothing. reply scbzzzzz 17 hours agorootparentThanks for Pythagorean cup analogy, interesting read. I didn&#x27;t know such thing exists. reply ninju 13 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pythagorean_cup reply gigaflop 18 hours agorootparentprevA funny edge case of those glasses might be accidental blurring of people&#x27;s faces, if their face is prominent enough in advertisements. reply Draiken 18 hours agorootparentHahaha, haven&#x27;t thought of that! I&#x27;d probably call that a feature and not a bug. reply keb_ 20 hours agoparentprevEvery HN thread about YouTube and ads, we see the same ads&#x2F;tracking&#x2F;Google apologist fallacies:1. Equivocating adblock with stealing2. Using adblock deprives content creators of funds3. Users of adblock are entitled whiners who just want free stuff4. Without ads, YouTube cannot existIt is getting tiring. reply izacus 19 hours agorootparentJust as tiring as everyone pretending that YouTube doesn&#x27;t offer a directly paid solution to the ads problem. reply danShumway 19 hours agorootparentYoutube actually got rid of their directly paid solution to the ads problem and now forces it to be bundled with other services, because (and I can not stress this enough) Google does not want you to pay directly for content.Youtube Premium exists so that Google has something to point to when it wants to say that paid services aren&#x27;t viable. That&#x27;s why they charge way more than creators get out of ads, that&#x27;s why they force it to be bundled with other services, that&#x27;s why they introduce restrictions like simultaneous viewing limits and login requirements and app restrictions that make the service tangibly worse than the experience of anonymously blocking ads.Youtube does not want you to pay for content. It wants to monetize your data and serve you ads. It wants your consumption to be a passive habit, it does not want you to be actively engaged with funding the creators you care about.Youtube doesn&#x27;t offer a paid alternative to ads. It offers ad-free viewing as a side-perk when you buy other significantly more expensive Google services. reply spiderice 18 hours agorootparentThere are a lot of claims in there with pretty much nothing to back them up. From my perspective, Youtube Premium is the shining example of a \"streaming service\" done right. One tier, all the features. They aren&#x27;t upcharging you to a second paid tier to remove ads, 4k streaming, unlock more videos, etc.. like a lot of the other streaming services do.If I had to cancel all of my streaming services except one, Youtube Premium would be the one I keep. And that&#x27;s say a lot given that it&#x27;s the only one that makes all of its content \"free\" (with caveats of ads, tracking, etc..) for unpaid users. reply Brian_K_White 13 hours agorootparentShining Example???? Holy shit...I have paid for premium for years and my youtube experience is still utter garbage.I still see ads because they are baked in every video now as well, not to mention I can&#x27;t always use my account (other people&#x27;s devices), not to mention my expensive Premium home screen is now blank because I don&#x27;t subscribe to channels and I turned off history (neither of which are needed to be able to populate a feed of non-random stuff, since they were already doing it fine for years), and when it wasn&#x27;t blank, it was utter shit the last few years showing me the same 11 videos I already saw every day), but somehow, only the last few years, somehow, before that, it was able to do at least reasonable feed of new stuff with no subscriptions and no history. And Then we have their capricious censoring and dmca strikes which impoverishes my landscape by deleting half of the actually interesting content and stunts all the rest into avoiding any possible topic that might get their livlihoods killed, because practically anything could possibly be painted as either dangerous or someone else&#x27;s copyright. But the trashiest of the trash stuff, but which sells ads, that shit flows never ending. Half of my favorite creators have Kafkaesque stories like Fran Blanches. That&#x27;s what I get for my Premium dollars, infuriating stories about how the people I just paid fucked someone nice and terrorized everyone else they haven&#x27;t fucked yet.The value of Youtube premium is exactly this: It&#x27;s pulling out 8 of your fingernails instead of 10. reply danShumway 18 hours agorootparentprev> One tier, all the features.That is literally my complaint with it, that&#x27;s exactly what I said. You can not pay Youtube specifically to remove ads.What do you want me to back up here, you&#x27;re agreeing with me about what the product is: it&#x27;s a music&#x2F;video streaming service that contains ad-free viewing on the side. Do you want evidence that ad-free viewing through Youtube premium is worse than with adblockers? That&#x27;s pretty straightforward to provide; just look at the experience of Youtube&#x27;s official apps vs NewPipe, interruptions between computers, lack of anonymous viewing -- it straightforwardly factually supports fewer viewing options than adblockers do.I&#x27;m not saying you shouldn&#x27;t be happy with the service if you like it, I&#x27;m saying that if a company is bundling a Spotify alternative with their ad-free option and requiring you to pay for both, then they&#x27;re not offering an ad-free option on its own.And that&#x27;s especially the case if the company did offer an ad-free option in the past and then stopped offering it. I think it&#x27;s extremely reasonable to theorize about why a company might make that decision. reply squeaky-clean 17 hours agorootparent> is bundling a Spotify alternative with their ad-free option and requiring you to pay for bothIt&#x27;s literally just youtube without the video component. You can find everything song ever on youtube as a video. This is just saving you bandwidth and battery. It would be more expensive for them to offer ad-free youtube without the music-only component, because people would still use it to listen to music, but now with video attached to every song.> lack of anonymous viewingHow is anonymous viewing possible with paid accounts? They need to know if you&#x27;re a subscriber or not. Even services that aim for anonymity like Mullvad require you to login with your user id to use it. Should there be a \"trust me, I&#x27;m a paid subscriber\" button? You can just delete watched videos from your history. reply danShumway 16 hours agorootparent> This is just saving you bandwidth and battery. It would be more expensive for them to offer ad-free youtube without the music-only component, because people would still use it to listen to music, but now with video attached to every song.I think you&#x27;re oversimplifying Youtube Music (and ignoring that Youtube Premium does include exclusive content), but assuming it is just Youtube without a video stream -- does it strike you as odd at all that the inclusion of a cost-saving feature would cause an increase in the price of the service for customers? Does that make you doubt at all whether or not this product is priced around the actual cost of ad-free content?> How is anonymous viewing possible with paid accounts?There are ways to do this using things like blinded tokens, but to fair they&#x27;re complicated and Google is unlikely to pursue them. It does get at the inherent tradeoff here -- the way Google has structured Youtube Premium it is impossible to use it in a privacy preserving way.And I think even ignoring the other problems with Youtube Premium and even ignoring the bundling issues, there is a little bit of a disingenuous nature to these arguments of \"don&#x27;t like ads, just pay\" when everyone understands that by the very nature of the product, paying does not remove many of the negative aspects of Google advertising that people are trying to avoid.In a way, I&#x27;m being overly charitable here; Google bundles ad-free viewing as part of an extended package, but the other problem that I didn&#x27;t complain about is that buying that package literally doesn&#x27;t get rid of entire problem and in fact requires you to use Youtube in a way that makes the problem worse, because at least when you&#x27;re signed out your data isn&#x27;t getting quite so explicitly linked to you as an individual. reply riddley 15 hours agorootparentprevI recently ended my YouTube premium sub because they started...... showing ads. reply amrocha 15 hours agorootparentI think this is the long play that most people aren&#x27;t seeing, or are willfully ignoring.Just like Netflix did, eventually youtube will jack up the price of the ad free option and introduce ads to the basic subscription.Enshittification ad infinitum. reply jasonlotito 18 hours agorootparentprevYouTube Premium is the ad-free offering that they keep adding stuff to. I&#x27;ve been on it since it was Red, and I&#x27;ve enjoyed it the entire time. The price has gone up from the original $9.99, but not dramatically so. YouTube Red originally launched with music, so that&#x27;s not new, and Premium has other nice features beyond ads, like video downloads and what not. So, I&#x27;m not sure what \"bundled services\" were added to YouTube premium that you are talking about.Oh wait, I can watch some movies for free, on YouTube.Oh wait, I can share my membership with my family for less than the original cost of YouTube Red... the horror.Those all seem related to watching YouTube videos, and not other services, so not entirely sure what you mean.I don&#x27;t know, honestly, it feels like you don&#x27;t want to pay for the ad-free experience at the price point they set. And that&#x27;s fine. They have a price point, and you don&#x27;t want it cheaper. 100% fine, but that&#x27;s all there is to it. reply danShumway 18 hours agorootparentI subscribed to Youtube Premium when it came out, back when it was still called Youtube Red. I&#x27;ve written a couple of times in the past about why I eventually gave up on the service. I can dig some of those comments up if you want me to but the short version is: not only am I willing to pay for content, I have subscribed and paid for content through the exact option you describe and it wasn&#x27;t the cost that drove me away.I will also point out, Youtube Premium is not primarily an ad-free Youtube service (and neither was Youtube Red, it also came bundled with Google Play Music). It is a paid video service and music service that happens to also contain ad-free viewing. Youtube Premium Lite did exist as an ad-free Youtube service. Google axed it.They axed it because Google doesn&#x27;t want that -- it does not want to have a service that is priced around specifically the cost of removing ads from Youtube. Of course they axed Youtube Premium Lite, because Google wants to have a cable package, and then to be able to point to that cable package and say \"see how expensive ad-free viewing is?\"It would be a long conversation to talk about why that bundling is problematic, both from a competitive standpoint (see Amazon Prime) and from a \"support creators\" standpoint (the amount of money going back to creators is much lower than they&#x27;ll get from direct support). But I&#x27;m going to keep going back to -- there is no option to pay specifically to remove ads from Youtube; Google killed that service and it&#x27;s now only available as part of a bundling system with other services. reply joombaga 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d like to pay less money and not get music. Just no ads. YouTube Red launched with Google Play Music, which I enjoyed. But that&#x27;s gone now, and I&#x27;m paying for YouTube Music which I do not use. reply keb_ 19 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t solve the tracking problem, which is something adblock does.uBlock Origin unironically provides a better value and experience than YouTube Premium does. reply PJDK 18 hours agorootparentWould anyone be condemning people who paid for youtube premium and also blocked tracking with ublock? reply danShumway 18 hours agorootparentI actually did this for a while (not condemn people :) -- I paid for Youtube and then never signed in and continued to use 3rd-party apps and uBlock Origin).One big issue is that your payment then is basically just to Youtube -- and it&#x27;s kind of impossible to avoid because the point is to stop Youtube from obsessively tracking everything you view and do, but in the process you stop Youtube from knowing which videos you&#x27;re watching, so the creators are no longer getting their piece of that pie.It&#x27;s a tricky problem, I&#x27;m not sure how to solve it using Youtube Premium&#x27;s model (that&#x27;s not true I can think of ways to solve this using some kind of anonymous token system, but Youtube&#x27;s never going to do that).It&#x27;s part of why I advocate now for supporting creators directly (and by extension not caring about Google&#x27;s profits, although that&#x27;s secondary). But you could still buy Youtube Premium on the side if you specifically want to support Youtube; it&#x27;s just if you&#x27;re using 3rd-party clients I don&#x27;t think that gets rid of the obligation to help the creators themselves. reply keb_ 18 hours agorootparentprevThat is a good question. I would hope not, but I suppose an argument could and would be made that you are still violating the TOS by blocking trackers, and by blocking them, you are depriving YouTube (and its creators) from another means of compensation by stifling the effectiveness of adverts. reply tjarrett 19 hours agorootparentprevOf course you also have to pay for Youtube Music which is inferior to Apple Music and Spotify.If they&#x27;d bust YouTube Premium apart from YouTube Music it&#x27;d be cheaper and a more inviting proposition. reply drcongo 18 hours agorootparentYouTube Music is hilariously bad. I doubt there&#x27;s a person alive who is using that out of choice. reply nerdjon 19 hours agorootparentprevhere is the thing, I have yet to see any proof that by paying to removing ads from YouTube that they are removing the main problem and that is the constant tracking.If the root of the problem exists its not fixing the problem and its just fixing it for non technical people, since most don&#x27;t understand the real problem or how it works. reply bluescrn 17 hours agorootparentprevThey killed their most reasonably-priced ad-free option (without bundled music service):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;9&#x2F;25&#x2F;23889917&#x2F;youtube-premium-... reply astronads 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd it costs more than the amount of revenue my viewing of ads generate them. reply scbzzzzz 19 hours agorootparentprevtrue, but they bundle with youtube music and other services that i don&#x27;t use. I don&#x27;t see value paying for everything. there is no option to buy just youtube - ads(atleast where I live). it is a manipulative tactic. you are gaslighted for not seeing ads on internet (public space) and when you want to buy the service, they bundle it with other services. reply bongobingo1 19 hours agorootparentPremium is $24&#x2F;m here!Maybe I am dumb, but it does seem that if they offered a dirt cheap \"just no ads\" plan for like 2-5$&#x2F;m they could probably get a higher conversion rate, maybe the actual 10x they&#x27;d \"need\" to match the current price.I think a lot of people watch youtube as a \"second screen\" thing like people historically left the TV on for some kind of connection, or when going to sleep, etc. That kind of content is probably not worth 24&#x2F;m to most, but 2$? reply jasonlotito 18 hours agorootparentWhere is &#x27;here&#x27;? It&#x27;s $22 here in the US, but that is for the family plan (6 people, so just under $4 per person).> but 2$?Yeah, I highly doubt that covers the cost of serving up videos ad-free while also being able to provide anything of substance to the creators (which earn more per user from premium viewers than from ads). reply bongobingo1 6 hours agorootparentAu, 15usd&#x2F;m.> but 2$?>> Yeah, I highly doubt that covers the cost of serving up videos ad-free while also being able to provide anything of substance to the creators (which earn more per user from premium viewers than from ads).Well if 2$&#x2F;m with a 12x conversion rate doesn&#x27;t cover, then neither does $24&#x2F;m at a 1x conversion rate, so the current wouldn&#x27;t be sustainable either? reply realusername 19 hours agorootparentprevYoutube Premium is a joke, it&#x27;s priced at probably 50 times the revenue that Google gets for the average user.I&#x27;m even wondering if they feel like it&#x27;s a real option internally and not just a small gimmick to capture the most paying customers. reply redserk 19 hours agorootparentprevIn fairness, there’s also the misguided assumption that services cost nothing to host and ad revenue cannot possibly offset the costs. reply scbzzzzz 19 hours agorootparentYes ad-revenue offsets , I want to point out, premise it self is wrong. their business model itself is not sustainable (as per my understanding)with present free +ads&#x2F;paid model. you are just subsidizing their bad decisions forgoing your privacy&#x2F;time&#x2F;money.even with ads, hosting free video content is not sustainable. just look at the trajectory, internet users are stagnating, time of a day is limited. which means all users watch-time is constant. it is profitable now, but not forever(if above premise is true)but youtube has to host all the data since its inception, and new content is added everyday. (maintenance cost increases day by day + but income is stagnated)only way out is to charge&#x2F;limit content creators. or else it will be (never ending increase of number of ads&#x2F;price increase). reply cat_theorist 19 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;2&#x2F;3&#x2F;21121207&#x2F;youtube-google-al...YouTube us very profitable. It’s just that they want even more and they believe forcing users to turn off their adblockers will get them there. Smells monopolistic to me. reply jsnell 18 hours agorootparentYour link says nothing about the profitability of YouTube, just about the revenue. reply cat_theorist 18 hours agorootparentThey don’t publish that number, but you know it’s in the billions.Here’s alphabet’s gross income (155b USD): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;market-data&#x2F;quotes&#x2F;GOOG&#x2F;financials&#x2F;annua...And here’s an estimate of YT’s profit margin: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mannhowie.com&#x2F;youtube-valuation#youtube-profit-margi...My point wasn’t about the specific number, it was a qualitative one: people in this thread claim that YT needs to kill Adblockers to pay for the service and survive. They don’t. They’re already making billions without crippling web browsers to disable Adblockers. reply jsnell 16 hours agorootparentI certainly don&#x27;t know that their profit is in the billions. Neither do you, unless you&#x27;re a high level Google executive.The source you have for estimating the profit margin is just total guesswork. It&#x27;s estimating the costs purely by taking the operating costs of other companies with different business as a percentage of their revenue, and then applying that same percentage to YouTube. That&#x27;s an absurd methodology. You could just apply it to any business and show they&#x27;re profitable.(As an example, for years AWS was profitable and GCP wasn&#x27;t. But applying the methodology from your link would have resulted in the belief that GCP was wildly profitable. And those business were far more similar to each other than Netflix and YouTube are!)Also, you are making a point about a specific number: You are claiming the profit is greater than 0. It could be true! It could also not be true.

Finding creators without using YouTube is very hard, at least for me. It&#x27;s hard even inside YT.But most creators are exclusively on YT because that&#x27;s the only choice that matters.There is Nebula now that does have some nice content, but they&#x27;re orders of magnitude smaller (plus their UX is very rough) so it&#x27;s hard to even call them a competitor.That&#x27;s why monopolies - capitalism&#x27;s inevitable end goal - destroy everything they touch. In order to argue \"you can choose to not do X\" requires the choice part to be true. Sure, we can argue people can completely forego X. But that&#x27;s basically a nuclear option that even if they wanted to do, will be hard. People will still send you YouTube links.One example of this is WhatsApp. I hate it and don&#x27;t want to support Meta, but 100% of my peers use it so I have to use it.Having said all that, when YouTube starts to price hike subscriptions and&#x2F;or showing ads even for paying users (inevitable because of profits), I&#x27;ll force myself to stop using it. reply nix0n 16 hours agorootparentprev> why people just don&#x27;t use sites&#x2F;services that show them adsThe point I&#x27;m trying to make is that everything shows ads.Most content is only available on services that show ads.How do you consume media? reply keb_ 19 hours agorootparentprevWho says people who use adblock don&#x27;t do that?

I would allow those ads if they existed.It sucks since I do think ads are important, website operators need some way to make money and it is clear that most people are not going to pay for the things they have grown accustom to getting for free.

If I publish a site that&#x27;s a mangled copy of a trademarked site, that&#x27;s gray area. For my PC usage, no gray area. Same with disassembling, reverse engineering, etc.Then, I have a right to publish any tools that perform any customizations over owner&#x27;s items, be them hardware or software. Customizing proprietary software and reselling it is illicit. Customizing for one&#x27;s own purposes isn&#x27;t (the proprietor may choose to drop support for owner on his prerogative).Most important point is that YT and alikes want to freeload in the middle area. They want to be free and public, but they want to force the way you consume them. That is a no go. YT can choose to make a closed system, but then they would lose all random people without accounts finding YT links and watching them. Really, tie the google account, and set up watching quotas, direct payment or any other system where YT directly gets \"paid back\". The user can use his tokens to access streams from wherever he wants, youtube-dl or whatnot. reply acdha 21 hours agoparent> Right of computer owner to access public network resourcesThis misunderstanding is the basis of your entire argument: YouTube is not a public resource. It’s a private company providing access to mostly private content in exchange for payment under certain terms.Currently they have the right to deny access as desired and even to pursue legal charges against people who don’t follow their terms. The only way to change the situation is to change the law, such as what some countries have done to limit the amount of tracking they’re allowed to perform. Client portability would be an interesting but challenging argument to make since they would have raise not only the past estimates of revenue lost due to unauthorized redistribution but now would almost certainly make the argument that creators need to be protected against unauthorized AI usage, too.

Can I really set up a blog, put an obscure Terms of Service link somewhere, and legally obligate anyone who reads a single blog post to follow those terms - even if they never clicked the link?I somewhat doubt it. reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentThere have been a number of cases holding that it’s not criminal as long as you aren’t knowingly impacting service to others (e.g. Oracle v. Rimini). Similarly, I can’t put in a “you owe me one million dollars” clause and expect to collect unless I can prove that you knew about it and agreed.That’s not what’s being argued here, though: YouTube isn’t taking people to court, they’re just enforcing their terms better. Some people don’t like that and are trying to invent some legal right to continue accessing that content, but that simply doesn’t exist. reply josephcsible 19 hours agorootparentprevBy reading this comment, you agree to my Terms of Service.My Terms of Service are that you must send me $100. reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentOkay, now try to construct something which is actually a valid comparison:If you don’t respond to this comment politely, I won’t reply.Nobody is saying YouTube can arbitrarily bill you - only that they’re entirely within their rights to stop giving you free things if you don’t follow their terms of service for use of their private property. reply Qwertious 19 hours agorootparentprevOh, fuck.

In this case, it means “available with ads”. They’ve made the decision that more people watch ads than buy video, which has clearly worked well for them but also means that they don’t have other content available when the creators don’t like that (for example, movies generally aren’t available without an additional payment). reply paulryanrogers 21 hours agoparentprevAd-impressions as payment is one of the most accessible means of service monetization in the world. You only need eyes or ears to be granted access. Cutting that off, or somehow ruling it illegitimate to require, will raise the bar and cut off less affluent and less educated communities. reply Ajedi32 20 hours agorootparentThis is true. Maybe the deal just needs to be negotiated in a more formalized way. I kind of like how Brave handles the problem, where the browser itself shows you ads (in a much less obtrusive and more privacy-preserving way than how sites do it) and then distributes the resulting funds to the sites you visit. If advertising were structured that way, instead of how it is now where sites will serve up ads and get aggressive if your client chooses not to display them, then you could retain advertising as an option for those who want it while also allowing alternative payment methods for those who would prefer that, and preserving end user control over the software running on their machine. reply _Algernon_ 21 hours agoparentprevThe right to general purpose computing should be part of the constitution in any country that claims to value free speech. reply nonethewiser 21 hours agorootparentAnd who is obligated to provide these resources?

It’s not like anyone is arguing that you must use YouTube so I don’t see freedom of association or your control of what you do on your computer being impacted. I would support claims if, say, a public school required students to watch videos but that would be against the school for having picked an unsuitable vendor rather than YouTube. reply _Algernon_ 20 hours agorootparentRights aren&#x27;t necessarily added to the constitution because they&#x27;re currently being violated. They&#x27;re added to secure the rights into the future.There are many developments that are moving in the direction of this being violated, the most recent of which is Web Environment Integrity[0].[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Web_Environment_Integrity reply freedomben 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re arguing a positive right to general purpose computing (where somebody has to provide you with) or a negative one (where somebody can&#x27;t stop you from having). Could you please clarify? reply _Algernon_ 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m arguing a negative right: \"This would be more about putting a limit on the degree to which this right can be impeded in the legal system and by regular laws which happens to be the main point of a constitution.\" reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentSo what precisely are you asking for? reply _Algernon_ 18 hours agorootparentAs I said, \"The right to general purpose computing should be part of the constitution in any country that claims to value free speech.\" reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentYes, but that’s not related in any way to using a private service without paying for it. You have that now and if YouTube shut down tomorrow you’d still have it. reply freedomben 15 hours agorootparentAt this point GP has made clear higher up in the thread. GP said they are arguing a negative right, which means that it&#x27;s not something somebody has to provide to you, it&#x27;s something they are prohibited from doing to you. For example, Freedom of Speech in the US Constitution is a negative right, meaning that the government cannot prevent you from your freedom of speech. It doesn&#x27;t compel anyone to do anything to \"give\" you that right, it means that it can&#x27;t be taken away from you.What you are arguing against would be a positive right, in which case I would agree with you. And to be clear, there are others arguing for the positive version vs. the negative version[1], so it&#x27;s very easy to get cross threaded on this topic, but is ultimately a very different philosophical thread[1] For example, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37899830 reply acdha 13 hours agorootparentI’m fully aware, but they’re unclear about what specifically they believe should apply here. There’s no right to access someone else’s videos and the example they gave of drinking water doesn’t remotely fit this situation since that’s both a necessity and in most cases provided by a regulated utility rather than a normal business.We typically think of these kind of rights in the context of governments or natural monopolies because you don’t have a choice about using those but that’s clearly not a valid position here. The closest I can come would perhaps be a government privacy regulation limiting the types of tracking which a company is allowed to perform or perhaps some requirement that things like DRM not be restricted to a single option, but they have specified anything in enough detail to know if that’s what they had in mind. reply _Algernon_ 16 hours agorootparentprevI believe my comment is perfectly clear in the context of the comment I was responding to. reply acdha 13 hours agorootparentThat’s probably why you aren’t getting much support: if you can’t specify what you’re saying in enough detail for anyone else to even know what you mean it’s going to be hard for us to talk about it. reply vharuck 20 hours agorootparentprevFor hardware, the government could subsidize manufacturers for units sold in the country that meet requirements.

Modern ads are based on creating wants, rather than addressing needs. The more wants you have, the less satisfied you will be with your life.If I needed to do some home improvement and went to the hardware store, and there were ads for certain brands in the store, that&#x27;s not a problem. The ads are giving me information about a product that I might need.But that&#x27;s not how most advertisement works. Car companies don&#x27;t advertise to people who need a car to commute, they show you an ad with a hot guy driving a car in a beautiful landscape and make you want to be that guy. You can&#x27;t be the guy without the car, so you want the car. The goal of the ad is not to inform, it&#x27;s to create a desire.I don&#x27;t want to want. I want to be content, and I can&#x27;t be content if I&#x27;m always wanting. The only way around it is to not want in the first place.If you&#x27;re a Buddhist monk then you can do that already, but I&#x27;m not. Human nature is to want things, so the way I have to prevent myself from wanting things is by not exposing myself to superfluous ads. reply globular-toast 14 hours agoparentCompletely agree.

You could argue that they aren&#x27;t somehow fundamentally entitled to make money, but you are also not fundamentally entitled to consume their content. The content creator had to do work to produce the content and YT has to do work to provide a platform where it can be disseminated. Naturally, they want to be paid for doing this work. We can argue about how much they should be paid, but again nobody is forced to watch YT. It&#x27;s a voluntary transaction. If you don&#x27;t like ads, buy a YT subscription. If you don&#x27;t want to support YT, encourage your content creators to provide their content elsewhere.Practically, some companies have been historically willing to shut one or both eyes over open source&#x2F;free projects as a gesture of goodwill (or marketing exercise). The moment money is involved, the lawyers tend to be unleashed and the whole \"this is just a free hobby project with no monetary incentives for the developers\" goes out the window. reply janoc 21 hours agorootparentThe problem with that argument is that that ship has long sailed.Today it is next to impossible to securely use the internet without having an adblocker installed and enabled (or using something like Freetube, which is essentially a specialized ad blocking browser), otherwise you are exposing yourself to drive-by malware installs. Ads were and are a major vector here, including Google ones, given their market size. Heck, even FBI recommends it for exactly these reasons!So if someone is arguing that I have to make my computer less secure only to make sure they can monetize my eyeballs, that&#x27;s a no, full stop.I would happily pay and support the artists or creators (and I do so) - but not by removing adblock and opening myself to an indiscriminate onslaught of insecure and poorly made ads.And lets not delude ourselves with these moral arguments here - this isn&#x27;t and never was about funding the creators of that content. Most Youtube video creators don&#x27;t see a dime for their work from Google - and yet Youtube wouldn&#x27;t exist without them and Google directly profits from that work.The choice of business model - provide free video supported by advertising - was also Google&#x27;s. Nobody forced them into it and they are free to make YT subscription-only.However, if YT was a paid service from the start, they wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near where they are today.And don&#x27;t get me started on the evolution of ads on YT - I have no issues with watching an ad or two per video. But these days you have unskippable pre-roll ads, you have (often multiple) mid-roll ads, you have ads at the end of the video and all that in addition to whatever sponsor promotion is directly in the video itself (and which actually pays the video creator).

It&#x27;s possible for an individual to believe in the right of a creator to monetize their own work but have other reasons (overly aggressive, quality, scams, fraud, and malware) for choosing not to consume the advertisements.I suspect that if it weren&#x27;t for the steep decline in the quality of advertisements or their overly aggressive nature, many users of content blockers would have never being pushed to seek out a solution that grants them reprieve from the punishing barrage. reply acdha 21 hours agorootparentYouTube has an easy way to ensure you never see an ad: pay for premium.Remember, this is private media, not something you have a right to use.

I haven&#x27;t signed any contract with youtube, nor with its content uploaders. If Youtube or the people uploading content to it wants to force me to pay to view it, they have a simple solution: make it subscription only.

I&#x27;ll browse their books, read a few, and walk out without buying anything if I please.If they don&#x27;t like this, they can turn me away at the door. But they don&#x27;t, they let me and I&#x27;m not signing any contracts with them, so fuck their rule. reply prmoustache 18 hours agorootparentprevThere is no deal, no contract signed. So there is no deal to follow. reply acdha 18 hours agorootparentThe terms of service still apply. If you choose not to follow them, don’t complain when they stop allowing you access. Nobody _needs_ to access YouTube so there’s no harm in not having access to their service. reply mcpackieh 17 hours agorootparentprev> Not legally.Call the police, nobody cares. replyHenryBemis 21 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s kinda like the F2P and P2W.

Getting premium is P2W.My problem is not the $10 per month, it is that those people will STILL collect and sell my data to anyone who will buy it. $10 don&#x27;t keep my data &#x27;safe&#x27;. $10 is just to avoid ads. I wonder if they will ever make a PremiumPrivate subscription that will cost $20 where you get to avoid ads AND keep your data pritave. (easy answer --> no) reply drexlspivey 21 hours agorootparentprev> Morally, you are depriving the content creators and Youtube of revenue (if they rely on Youtube ads)In my 20+ years on the internet I have never clicked on an ad. I might have been made aware of a product that I went and purchased later when I actually needed it but never at the moment I saw the ad, meaning no affiliate revenue for the platform&#x2F;creator. Am I allowed to block ads then, since there is a 100% guarantee that you won’t be getting any money from me?(I pay for YT premium so it doesn’t directly apply to me but the point still stands) reply acdha 20 hours agorootparentAds are also billed by impression, so you’re still removing revenue from the people who made the videos you watch.More importantly, however, this is like going into a restaurant and saying that you should be able to order only a side dish while eating food that you brought with. You might have a good reason for wanting to do that but that doesn’t somehow create a right to use someone else’s private property in violation of their wishes. reply someone7x 19 hours agorootparentMust I buy the product at Costco after I’ve tasted the sample or am I just a freeloader?Am I morally obliged to acknowledge the sponsors for everything I personally don’t purchase?To whom do I owe patronage when I accept something gratis? reply acdha 18 hours agorootparent> Must I buy the product at Costco after I’ve tasted the sample or am I just a freeloader?No, because the owner of that property has set terms allowing that. Try to eat a dozen samples, though, and they’ll probably ask you to leave.This isn’t actually a complicated concept: their property, their rules. If you don’t like YouTube, that’s totally reasonable – I don’t – but no amount of sophistry will create a right for you to use their private property on your terms. Just go somewhere else: there are tons of creators who’d love a better deal than Google&#x2F;Facebook offer them but that’s never going to happen as long as people insist on paying them through YouTube. reply someone7x 17 hours agorootparentBy your reasoning, YouTube (like Costco) should ask the actual freeloaders to stop instead of imposing ads on every Costco member in a misguided quest to profit on every single free sample.I’m impressed you saw what should really happen at Costco, but disappointed you could not extrapolate that thinking to the YouTube case. reply acdha 17 hours agorootparentThat analogy doesn’t make any sense - the free samples are the ads! – but in both cases there’s a simple principle: your use of someone else’s property happens on their terms. If you don’t like their business, go somewhere else. reply skydhash 16 hours agorootparentNo! They want me to look at their videos because they need me to look at their ads. I choose the former, not the latter. There’s various way they could enforce their rules but they won’t do it because they want the maximum people they can get. I’m not asking for free content, they are pushing it to me. I just take the content and leave the ads out. reply acdha 13 hours agorootparentThat’s a position, sure, but don’t complain when they block you. reply skydhash 12 hours agorootparentI won&#x27;t. Lots of news sites do and I just go back. replyamelius 21 hours agorootparentprevThere is nothing moral about how the market works. You only get as much money as your business model allows you to get. Someone invents a great mathematical identity, but oops, there is no business model, so no money. Also, if there was a way to unwatch content and get your money back, I bet most people would use it. But this doesn&#x27;t exist and content makers greedily exploit this fact. reply Timshel 21 hours agorootparentprevMorally I prefer to support creators outside of the Google ecosystem. With youtube premium it&#x27;s not like they stop tracking then selling what you do, you just gave them even more information with your paiement details ...The tracking&#x2F;advertising industry is a cancer, yes it allows some free content and remuneration but at the same times it kills competition from less established actors. Those actors can&#x27;t just burn money to keep you there while they resell all they can on their own ad network.So yes I&#x27;ll block it and if it makes Youtube lose money then they will need to change their model and make it more hostile to users. Which can only help external platform such as Nebula and others grow.And if those platform grows then creators might be able to leave Youtube. reply BLKNSLVR 21 hours agorootparentprevI put a lot of effort into maintaining my network and various devices so that content that I don&#x27;t want is kept on the outside of the boundary that I can control.

Buying a YouTube subscription is directly in support of ads. If you give Google money for a YouTube subscription you have just let Google know that ads are a great way for them to make money. They are now incentivized to implement more ads in the future.Paying to remove ads only causes more ads in the world. reply anothernewdude 21 hours agorootparentprev> Morally, you are depriving the content creators and Youtube of revenueNo, Youtube deprive the content creators. Like all publishers they give back only a fraction of what the content is worth by abusing their monopoly. reply adra 20 hours agorootparentYou know that YouTube is actually one of the few major platforms that are actually not fcking their content creators dry? They have kept their 50&#x2F;50 split while other platforms have hacked away at percentages to keep more for themselves.At least with YouTube&#x27;s case, they actually allow effectively anyone to upload mostly unlimited non-infringing content to their platform without the expectation of a single ad view. You may call them stealing from artists by not giving 100% back to their creators, but a notable chunk of the money collected really does go to keep the lights on for the entire product. It isn&#x27;t just rent seeking. Complain about the splits, sure let&#x27;s have a conversation. Complain about YouTube stealing money from artists, I&#x27;d say you don&#x27;t have a leg to debate here. reply pydry 21 hours agorootparentprevAs I understand it most content creators rely more on revenue from patreon, sponsorships and being on content owner controlled platforms like nebula.If you want, primarily, to contribute to the \"free sushi restaurant\" fund for google employees and financially support your friendly abusive global monpolist for purely moral reasons though by all means turn off that ad blocker... reply izacus 21 hours agorootparent> As I understand it most content creators rely more on revenue from patreon, sponsorships and being on content owner controlled platforms like nebula.They really don&#x27;t (which is demonetization hurts them every time YouTube does it).

It is a paywalled service where only paid users access the content. There isn&#x27;t much of adblocking on netflix or tracking protection and other stuff.What i am trying to say is, only netflix by their nature of a paywalled gateway can expect this \"no payment, no content\" rule because they have put technical roadblocks. if tomorrow netflix goes open, they will be treated like youtube. reply colesantiago 22 hours agorootparentprevCrypto is only used for non legitimate and speculative purposes and mostly scams.

Stocketa A dive into the app I designed, built and never launched. Oct 16, 2023 It was March 2020, I was in New England when covid quarantine had just begun and I found myself much more homebound. In these situations I'm not one to just do nothing. I always have some sort of project or hobby to keep me busy, be it taking and editing photos, writing detailed blog posts, or coding something. I had always wanted to learn iOS development, so this felt like the perfect opportunity. I was particularly keen to learn SwiftUI to build my designs natively. Years back I had dabbled with writing an Objective-C app, but it never quite filled me with joy, to say the least. As a designer, I've spent the last decade getting good with prototyping tools and frameworks to mimic realistic, interactive mobile prototypes. Building it myself was the natural next step to give me even more control over the experience, and get even deeper into the craft. I started learning Swift and SwiftUI basics with courses like Design+Code, and Hacking with Swift. But I knew myself—I learn best with a project of my own. I knew exactly what I wanted to build: a better stock portfolio tracker. The stock market had taken a plunge with covid and I was doing dozens of trades per week with everything on sale. It would be fun to have a simple app of my own to track the performance of my trades instead of dealing with the subpar sites and apps from my stockbrokers. Little did I know this project would consume my nights and weekends for over two years, often spending 10-20 hours a week on it. I built a ton of functionality, sweat all the details, wrote a comprehensive node backend for it, created an LLC for it, and managed an active Testflight. I was learning Swift and SwiftUI along the way, so I was often redesigning and rebuilding as I went. Eventually, I decided to stop pursuing it. I'll get into the why a bit later. This post is for me to document Stocketa. I designed and built a lot that I'm proud of and want to have somewhere to archive it before I pull the plug. The mostly-finished App Store screenshots that would have been published. What is was Stocketa Stocketa was a simple portfolio tracker designed with care. It came out of my frustration of having to check the clunky apps and sites that my brokers had just to get a glimpse at how my investments were doing. I'm a casual investor and don't need much from a tool like this but I had assets in various places, and I just wanted one easy and well-designed place to check them. I wanted to see real per-transaction gain/loss info, based on my own cost basis. While there are tons of apps, brokers, and neobanks that address this, nothing quite felt like what I wanted. There were several types of solutions in this space: First off, there are simple stock apps like Apple Stocks that let you see stock charts, news, and more. They have good data and don't require any accounts to use. However, they offer no functionality to log your holdings and track your gains/losses. There are lots of broker apps (e.g., Robinhood) that let you trade and track your holdings, but they only let you see your holdings from them, not from any other financial services you might use. Then there's a whole category of what I'd call advanced stock services like TradingView (and several that have since died or pivoted over the years), but they're not mobile-first or as elegant as I wanted. There are broader investment advisor services like Personal Capital. While they do often have some aggregator functionality to link up your other accounts, they're not that powerful for diving into individual assets, aren't particularly well-designed, and are primarily focused on upselling you on their own investment advising services (seriously, I used to get endless 8am calls from Personal Capital). And there are lots of smaller apps on the App Store where you can track your holdings but the design and UX leaves a lot to be desired. I've tried most of them. From a design perspective, I generally found that financial apps bias towards density when displaying your assets. They assume you have tons of stocks and prioritize a list view where you have to tap in to a detail view to see more info. I found myself constantly tapping in, manipulating a chart or looking at some basic stats, then swiping back and repeating all that for several stocks. It was not easy or the kind of at a glance info I wanted. That left me with my challenge. I wanted a simple portfolio tracker aimed at the casual investor. It didn't have to do it all, but it should aim to do a few things well. An app just for me. Going custom I was more than thrilled to be working on a new app from scratch. After years of working at large companies with rigid design systems and gobs of stakeholders for every little design decision, I was yearning for some creative freedom. Freedom from process, freedom from typical design constraints. I would be in full control, designing and building it myself. It was my side project after all. I had gotten tired of designing for traditional mobile apps. You know the type.. you add a tab bar, a typical navigation stack, page header and the app already feels significantly basic, muted, and limited out of the gate. This was my place to have fun. I wanted to go custom and toss out whatever components the system gives you for free. And I knew that by having to figure out how to build various UI components from scratch, I'd learn a lot along the way. Almost all of Stocketa's UI is custom. I will say that going custom is almost always the absolutely wrong thing to do 99% of the time. The operating system you're working in—be it iOS, Android, macOS—has invested a ton in a highly-considered suite of components. They're remarkably accessible, well-tested, and work on a variety of devices. It's absolutely no small feat to consider creating a custom component for your app. However, when going custom does make sense and you're okay with the added scope and responsibility, the app becomes your canvas to do whatever you want and make it yours. The first area where custom made sense for me was general app navigation. When I got started, I knew I wanted this app to have minimal app chrome. I didn't want a standard tab bar and header taking up space. I wasn't going to require much navigation: most things would just live inside the stock cards from the home timeline. The app would be focused around showing more with less. Personally, I only cared about tracking a few stocks, but I hated the work of constantly having to tap in to see a detail view, or interact with the chart. As such, the main scroll view needed to be more immersive and not get occluded by unnecessary app chrome. It started with app navigation, custom stock cards, sheets, and more. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time on the details with everything being custom. Below are a few examples: Pull to search While a pull-to-refresh interaction on a scroll view is common, I didn't want to make refreshing data a core part of the experience. Stock cards automatically update, and pulling to refresh wouldn't introduce any new cells like it would on a social media site, so it didn't make as much sense here. Instead, I opted to use a pull to search interaction—something that would introduce a new cell to the scroll list after you've found a new stock to add. Custom stock card, and detail view navigation Stock cards are the core element on Stocketa and they provide most of the info you'd need inline, along with inline interactions like swipe actions, and chart scrubbing. For further actions, a tap transports you to another elevation where the stock card stays in place, but everything else vanishes while related cards (like stock news, and holdings details) animate in. This was tricky to pull off well, but the key was overlayPreferenceValue and anchorPreference. Custom sheets Stocketa uses custom sheets in a few places, from date pickers to various informational views. The example shown here goes one step beyond, featuring a gradient background with animating twinkling stars via a basic particle emitter. Slowly dragging the sheet up/down also interpolates the background opacity. Custom app menu I wanted something a bit more elegant than iOS menus. Something like this would also give me room to advertise Stocket's paid plans, or your current membership status if you already subscribed. It was built in a way where you could dismiss either by tapping anywhere, or by scrolling away. Custom swipe actions It feels expected for contained items in a list like this to have swipe actions, such as swipe to delete. I wanted more control over the presentation and decided to build them custom. There's a few details there like the action slowly moving the more you swipe, and then animating to a selected state once a distance threshold has been met. Custom app header I only need to put two actions in the header, and didn't need a traditional header / navigation bar across other views. I wanted the buttons to be borderless when at the top of the page but transition to subtle buttons on top of the scroll view as it scrolled. I also interpolate the Stocketa text up and away based on scroll. Designing and building I started with the basics: getting a scroll view of stock cards working, adding charts, and hooking it up to a database for persistence (initially Core Data before moving to Firebase). Then I added the requisite network calls and polling to update the stock card from a financial data provider. I started with IEX as the data provider as they had a decent API, reasonable pricing, and allowed commercial use, which would be required for a consumer app like this to go on the App Store. Working on an early build in 2020. One of the initial key decisions with Stocketa was that I wanted to track stock transactions in a comprehensive way. Simply logging the number of shares you had for each stock was not going to cut it. This ended up being a significant amount of work to do properly, but it was necessary: For each stock sale or purchase I wanted to be able to display not only the total gain/loss, but per-transaction gain/loss so you could tell if an individual transaction was a good trade. When it comes to stock sales, I needed to know the cost basis method (FIFO, LIFO, et cetera) so I could correctly calculate and display the realized and unrealized gains on a particular transaction. When selling shares, I also needed to know from which previous transaction or transactions the shares would be sold so I could get the correct cost basis and accurately calculate the gain/loss based on the cost basis method. And then there was dealing with stock splits, which seems simple at first glance but ended up being quite a bit of work to build in a robust way: not simply altering previous transactions. They should be automatically applied for new splits, but also able to be manually applied if you didn't log split-adjusted transactions. A glimpse at part of how comprehensive transaction types in Stocketa were shown. At some point I gave it a name: Stocketa. In Greek you might say \"marketa\" (Μαρκέτα, though αγορά might be a more proper word) when referring to a market, so this was like coalescing Stock and Market with that in mind. When I was interviewing for a new job in 2021, I created these slides as part of my presentation after talking about my work at Twitter for the previous 9 years. These weren't all of Stocketa slides, and there was a lot of additional talking points I had for each slide, but you get the idea. Slides touching on various parts of Stocketa as of late 2021. The design of many of these screens is now outdated, but it's a good look at a point in time. A note about SwiftUI I kept designing, building.. and then redesigning and rebuilding. One of the side effects of learning Swift and SwiftUI as I was building this was that I was constantly redoing specific pages and parts of the app as I went. I continually found better ways to build things, and similarly I would continually refine designs. About a year or so into building Stocketa I wrote about my experience with SwiftUI. Much of that still rings true. SwiftUI has come a long way since iOS 13. It's more performant, there's more parity in available components and functionality compared with UIKit, and you get more control over things. And with iOS 17, you get some goodies like shaders, keyframes, scroll transitions, and more. Xcode showing a SwiftUI preview. There's still a gap between the types of things you can do with AppKit and UIKit, but SwiftUI is undeniably a powerful tool that's dramatically more approachable. And not just a coding tool; it's a great design tool. Designers can quickly lay things out, hook up interactions, and get a real feel for a design using a native tool. Almost all of Stocketa's UI is built with SwiftUI. There were only a few occasions when I found it necessary to use UIKit to achieve some goal.1 None of this would have been possible, or drawn me to take a closer look into building iOS apps, if it hadn't been for SwiftUI. What I built I used the app daily and continued pouring time into every feature and detail to meet my high quality bar. While I initially planned for this to be a simple to build app that would not require a backend, or even any user accounts, that did not last for long. I quickly realized I needed my own backend to unlock a few things. At first, this was so I didn't have to include the API key for my financial data provider inside the app for security reasons—I wouldn't want someone to find it and start running up my bill by abusing it. I created a backend proxy for the API with rate-limiting and throttling. Then, I wanted to have it be authenticated with user accounts, so I added Sign In With Apple along with a stock data caching system so that I only had to fetch stats for a stock once with a certain time period (depending on the particular stat that was either seconds, 24 hours, or weekly) regardless of however many user accounts needed that stock info. The main goal with that was to also reduce my costs associated with financial data API usage. By this point I really started enjoying the speed at which I could update endpoints and business logic entirely on the backend. I started moving logic I had in the app to the backend. Stocketa was starting to come together. Even though this was just a solo project, I used Linear to keep track of tasks, ideas, features, customer feedback, and milestones. I had prioritized lists of things to build and bugs to fix. I was using—and loving—Linear for this. Here's a list of most of the things I built for Stocketa: Onboarding Instead of a typical onboarding carousel, I opted to push pages through as if you're flying down the z-index. I also wanted it to introduce core components of the app, like the stock card. Lots of details are baked in the onboarding including custom path animations and gyro-based gradients, among others. Onboarding (Dark mode) Same experience as above, but dark mode. One variation I made for dark mode was the opening \"shimmer\" effect over the Stocketa logo is done with a more colorful gradient instead of a regular white gradient. Importing shares While you can manually add individual buy and sell transactions, the Stocketa import flow made this quicker via a tsv file that you can create via a spreadsheet. It also writes back to the tsv file to confirm import status so you can import again later when you add new shares on your desktop, synced via iCloud. Buying shares Stocketa allows users to manually add stock transactions. While this could have been a boring form with default iOS components, I wanted to make it feel like it was made for stocks. The form places the most focus on the essentials: quantity, price and, optionally, date. If you don't know the exact price you purchased a stock for, or want to add it later, Stocketa shows accurate placeholder text for the stock price that day—it changes to the correct historical price when you change the date. It has the ability to input per-share or per-transaction price, as well as log what broker was used. That's helpful so Stocketa can let you know how many shares are available to sell with that broker, and keep track of broker-specific cost basis. Selling shares Similar to above, this flow shows off adjusting the cost basis method. Stocketa supported all the basics like FIFO, LIFO, Average cost (default for mutual funds), Highest cost, Lowest cost, as well as specific lot if you're doing something a bit more advanced. Subscription upgrade page A different take on the traditional upgrade to a paid account page. This page also has a few small design details: parallax hero text, parallax description text that unblurs and fades in as you scroll, motion-based feature cards (not shown in this simulator video: shadows and position of cards in the back would shift around), and some small little fireworks when you reach the bottom. Subscription membership card For accounts with active subscriptions, I wanted a quirky, fun way to display account status in the form of a sort of membership card you could interact with. The background had an animated starfield-like effect that would speed up and get faster when you were interacting or holding the card down. There's also a small shimmer effect on the thank you text on the back of the card. Stock card display settings While the focus of Stocketa is about giving casual investors access to common actions they may need on a stock without navigating to a detail view (such as chart scrubbing or stats), I wanted this to be customizable. I have several stock card form factors, settings, and some neat custom micro-animations when toggling them. Stock transaction details Stocketa keeps track of individual transactions, their cost basis, cost basis method, and even stock splits. This makes it powerful in providing per-transaction, realized and unrealized gain/loss details. Holdings card The holdings card sits at the top of the main stock scroll view showing aggregate details, based on your settings. Longer term I had planned to evolve this with sparkline sharts for each stock, as well as the aggregate portfolio, as well as move away from the expanded card form factor which felt limiting. Tips card I didn't want the onboarding flow to be too long or required, opting to get people into the app sooner. But I wanted to help guide people around the core interactions at their own pace. I found this to be a great spot to use custom path animations for each page. Settings: Overview While settings sheets are nothing special, I put a bit more attention into Stocketa's. A few things of note: custom header on scroll, app icon selection carousel at top that scales on scroll, footer gradient with Stocketa \"foil\" that you can keep pulling up, and some push views with custom headers. Settings: Change app icon These days it's almost expected to be able to change an app's app icon to best fit your phone aesthetic. Most apps do this with a boring page listing out small icon thumbnails. I wanted to make this a core element to the settings page. Just swipe to preview and set an alternate app icon. Settings: Widgets I wanted to make it clear that Stocketa had widgets so I built this page to show them off and share installation instructions. I also replicated the same widget transform animation that iOS uses for widget setup. Widget setup Showing off how setting up an iOS widget for Stocketa worked. There were three widget types: individual stock, portfolio, and simple portfolio. They all had accent colors using a large gradient that would change based on stock or portfolio performance. Search: Quick inline prices I found it helpful when searching for a stock to see the price at a glance to help me figure out if it was what I was looking for. While it would be costly for me to provide prices inline for every search result, I did it for the first match as you typed. Stock splits One of the most complex, but necessary, parts of the app was keeping track of whether your transactions were post or pre-split, including multiple splits. Stocketa provided full control to manually or automatically apply splits as needed. Search categories To make it easier to find top stocks, I had the search empty state be a list of categories you could navigate through. This also featured a header using matchedGeometryEffect. The hard part was actually getting and organizing the content for these pages, including stock icons. That was a mix of building a scraping engine, along with some manual icon creation for a few securities. Face ID grace period Adding Face ID is a requirement for any app that keeps track of your financial assets. Beyond the basic functionality, I added a way to customize the grace period before Face ID would lock again. A longer grace period was handy if you were switching apps to check your stock purchases while manually logging them. This one was fun to build with custom gestures along an arc. Market holiday sheets For accounts holding stocks (not just crypto), Stocketa needed a way to indicate when the market was closed due to a holiday. This also entailed some server-side code to do the same for widgets. Feedback sheet I wanted to make it easier to receive app feedback and support requests, while also surfacing known issues and upcoming features I was working on to reduce support requests. I also added a toggle that people could flip if they had account-specific questions that would embed a token allowing me to find their account as I didn't store any other account identifiers for privacy. Sorting stocks This was done via a custom UIKit collection view. I originally wanted to do this directly in the main stock list view but it's easier to see them in a more compact list when you need to drag things around. Also, doing this in the main view would have been tricky with all the gestures already used by the stock cards (swipe, tap, long-press). Toasts Little iOS style alerts used for things like reaching limits when unsubscribed, or attempting to add a stock you've already added. Account deletion An App Store update in 2021 required that all apps that create accounts also have the ability to fully delete them in-app. I took that as a challenge to make it easy and delightful. Not shown here is how the background and the thank you text gradient are motion-based depending on how you're holding and moving your phone. I ran a small TestFlight alpha with close friends, then increasingly I added more people. At one point I was up to around 1,000 people. That was the most I wanted to allow. I received lots of feedback from overall great first impressions (below), to general feature requests, and of course lots of bug reports. Already the app is filling a need for me in its personal approach to tracking investments: no pushing for sales, no integrations with brokers and no unnecessary permissions. Brilliant. Simply amazed at the SwiftUI work you’ve poured into this app. So beautiful. The onboarding alone is a masterclass in attention to detail. Bravo. love it, this feels so polished and slick already... really great use of SwiftUI Just got the invite, added my stocks... the animations are beautiful, design is clean and precise... it’s all around beautiful. Congrats! F**k, man. This app is incredible. You’re building all of this on your own? Dude. This app is f**king beautiful. Really great job. Just imported shares - super easy. This NUX is insane. The particles when you add a stock. Gives me the happy brain chemicals.. I had thousands on a waiting list but there were API and hosting costs associated with the increased usage that I didn't want to bear yet, as well as a huge increase in support and customer feedback that took a lot of time to manage. You start to hear the same types of feedback, and it just becomes a chore to manage that many emails. That good news was that something was resonating and people cared enough to go through the work to send in bug reports and feature requests. The website At some point early in feature development I took a break to focus on the website. At first I wanted a simple landing page to build interest, and collect emails for a waitlist so I could keep people in the loop. And I didn't want to spend that much time on it. Video: Initial Stocketa teaser homepage. There was nothing fancy or particularly special about this initial page. It was just something quick I wanted to get out the door. And now, a while later, there's a lot I hate about this early design. The background texture was too strong, the headline alignment feels odd with the phone.. but I digress. In that initial design I did start playing with some wave-related elements—a loose reference to stock market charts going up and down. And then to add to that, I built a few mini stock cards gently hovering in place (thanks to offset-path CSS along with 2 keyframe animations) in the background. Each stock card had an SVG line chart—loosely based on that stock's actual performance around the time—that would animate on page load. I ended up keeping a version of these mini stock cards on the latest version of the website, and then on an onboarding screen inside the app. The original inspiration for these random floating stock cards was from my now out-of-date work page where I highlighted projects with some large cards, each with their own intro animation based on the project. One of them was for my work on Twitter Video, where video clip thumbnails would fan out from the phone on hover (shown below). The floating mini stock cards on the Stocketa homepage were inspired by the hover state animation on this project card from my old portfolio page. Homepage design v1.0 Video: The first full version of Stocketa.com in early 2021, currently archived here. The App Store QR code was meant to be displayed on scroll but in this version I didn't have that hooked up as the app wasn't live. In early 2021 I ended up getting around to designing and building out the first complete homepage for Stocketa. I had enough functionality and features built that it felt worthy of investing some time into showcasing them on the site. Lots of app websites at the time (and still now) had the typical hero section on their homepage: some app screenshot in a phone frame off to one side, with accompanying header and subtitle text adjacent. Nothing wrong with that, but I wanted something a bit more engaging. I wasn't entirely interested in optimizing for conversion, and cramming a lot in above the page fold. Initial design explorations in figma. I thought it would be nice to try to do something where the 3D phone frame was angled and then began to change position on scroll while a brief teaser video of the app functionality played. Apple had done something similar in recent years with product pages, such as the first-generation AirPods Pro. They used over 100 frames of the AirPods that would progress as you scrolled: Example of a technique used by Apple. There's a lot of ways to achieve an effect like this. One route route is using Lottie and essentially converting each frame of your video or animation to a base64-encoded string in a json file for the Lottie web player to manage. It's not a flawless solution, however, and can incur some large file sizes depending on what you're doing. It's best for vector micro-animations, not large devices with complex visual content. I also didn't want to incur the cost of that large initial json download blocking the very first thing you see on the site. Instead I opted to have javascript display a sequence of frames composited toalong with an offscreenCanvas for performance. I used Rotato to import my short Stocketa screencast, create a 3D phone video, and then create a PNG sequence of frames. I wasn't super pleased with the quality—the phone frame didn't look super realistic and had some rough pixelated edges—but it was good enough compared to doing it all by hand with other design tools. Scroll-based Stocketa 3D phone, paired with subtle parallax for header elements and the floating stock cards. There were some other minor scroll effects like the gradient glow behind the phone spreading. I then exported optimized transparent webp, and jpg files (with accompanying alpha masks created in Sketch to save bandwidth) and had the javascript detect which file type to use for the animation. While I was pleased with how this effect turned out, it ended up becoming a rather huge annoyance when I wanted to update the content later—it's a pain to generate, optimize, and update the image sequence each time. Other bits of the website: cards for various features. And finally, as for the rest of the content on this site I went with a basic feature card approach, sometimes called a \"bento box\" layout; particularly when varying card sizes are used. This is a layout that I've grown to like a bit less over the years as it has become very common. Homepage design v2.0 Video: New Stocketa site A year later, it was time for another redesign. Stocketa had more functionality, and a lot more refinements. I had more to share, and I had grown tired of the 3D phone frame interaction. It was neat but it was just there for show; it wasn't the best way to show off parts of the app as it scrolled off screen. It was also a pain to update the frame sequences. I essentially just wanted to take screenshots of the real app from the iOS simulator and upload them. Separately, I didn't want a super long page with a lot of repetitive modules and screenshots. I wanted a skimmable feature list. I began to wonder if I could get away with just a single phone frame on the site that showed everything. I eventually landed on a two pane approach: the device frame was always in view, fixed on the right side, while the scrollable left side contained the feature list. The trade-off with this design was that it would require hovering over each feature item to be able to update the screenshot shown in the device frame. I figured an interesting compromise to that would be having the phones stack up and away on scroll. Almost like the old Apple Time Machine backup UI. I built several versions of this and found that it didn't feel great. There wasn't much scroll distance so if you scrolled at a normal or fast pace, you'd see a bunch of phones flicker by you as the animations tried to keep up. It was too busy and hectic, not to mention a lot of state management to deal with jumping between your current scroll-based position screenshot to a hover-based screenshot if you hovered over a feature list item. I ended up simplifying a bit and only having the scroll-based UI manage just a few states: the intro phone frame, the first feature screenshot, and then a final animation at the bottom of the page. The website's mobile layout uses a carousel of screenshots in the header. After sorting out the core interactions, I had to figure out how to deal with mobile and tablet interactions. The fix two-pane layout made this a bit of a challenge. I ended up turning the header into a carousel of device frames you could scroll through. And then finally, I added a few small bits of polish ✨: Hero title text gradient changes based on scroll The icon accent color and background circle color change based on scroll When hovering over any feature list item, there is a subtle background color change created by an overlaid gradient. SVG-created noise/grain is also overlaid on top of the background. When hovering over any feature list item, or when you're reached the end of the page, there's a subtle icon particle emitter that floats up icons from the bottom. Each feature used a different icon for this. Particle emitter effects: icons float up from the bottom, based on the feature list item being hovered on. There's also another very subtle emitter generating some tiny floating particles. Overall I liked this design, but looking back at almost a year later, the gradient text and background colors feel a bit too much for my taste now. API troubles Eventually it became clear that the quality of financial data Stocketa relied on was not cutting it. The first provider I used, IEX, would sometimes have charts outdated, inaccurate prices (especially for less frequently traded assets on the IEX exchange), and lacked data for OTC markets (they required you sign a pricey license directly with OTC), as well as significantly limited data for Nasdaq-listed stocks (even basic things like pre-market and after-hours data). The last straw was when IEX dropped mutual fund data entirely, all without any advance notice. I later used another provider that allowed commercial use that didn't charge too much ($100/month) but I had even more problems with their data and reliability. Endpoints were even returning old and incorrect data, and even once alerted to issues, their team would not only ignore the bugs but claim they didn't exist. I couldn't ship Stocketa with unreliable financial data to people that would be paying me for a quality app. I also could not get certain types of data with paid APIs. I had to build a scraping engine on my backend that would visit a few sites to get the data I needed for less updated data like dividend yield, earnings dates, and even for OEF data (other providers would be more than a day delayed for this at times). Needless to say, this was all frustrating. It was a hassle, hard to maintain, and unreliable. At the same time, my backend continued getting more involved to deal with more and more of the intricacies of dealing with stocks. Things like dealing with companies merging or stock tickers renaming. ~13k LOC node/express backend (shown in Zed but I now prefer Cursor) for Cloud Run. It manages auth, caching, news, core business logic, cleaning up data, notifications, widgets, working with multiple API, and a bit of scraping. This was my first time doing anything of this size with node and typescript. Starting out I thought getting access to a stock market data API would be the easy part. I quickly learned about the world of market data feeds, SIPs (Securities Information Processor), and vendor agreements. Quality market data exists, it's just not made for indie app developers. It's very expensive. Several leading U.S. market data providers have commercial use data pricing starting at $2,000 per month. And that's not for everything, if you need things like index data or options data, there's more charges ahead. I spoke with one of these providers last year, trying to get them to understand how small app developers need affordable commercial use data. They presented a startup-focused plan that they were pitching for $499/month in addition to a per-MAU fee. Even that I would still consider very expensive for my needs, and it seems like that may have fallen by the wayside and is no longer promoted on their website. I could spend months developing Stocketa, incurring that monthly API cost until I went live (or risk getting shutdown if I tried to use a cheaper non-commercial plan during the TestFlight phase) then not make enough money to cover costs on the App Store and have to shut it down shortly after anyways. Overall, it feels like no one in this cares to cater to the developer and startup crowd, or they believe there's not much money for them to pursue there. This was the same case with Plaid when I briefly looked into getting access to their investments API to automatically sync holdings data. They required some sort of minimum length contract. Why I stopped working on Stocketa When I started this project, I really began to wonder why where weren't any great indie apps focused on stocks like this. Just simple, well-designed apps to help the casual investor keep track of their investments. Well I think I was starting to get my answer: getting quality financial data, even just for the United States, is a nightmare. You can only get it if you have a lot of money to invest in your project. And good luck if you really want a great API with comprehensive international data. I can't help but draw parallels to what happened recently with the Twitter and Reddit APIs. The risk of running your project or business solely on top of another company's API, no matter how reliable you think they may be, is extremely high. Stocketa was always meant to be a side project—never a real business. For it to be a real business, I would need to keep adding functionality and introducing more ways to make money. I couldn't just have a simple and elegant little app tracking your stocks. It would have to do more, like dipping into financial advice services, or offering stock trading. That's a hyper-competitive space lined with massive companies. That would mean a busier, cluttered app. The exact reason why I started Stocketa was because of all those cluttered apps. I decided to stop working on Stocketa for a few reasons: Data: As mentioned above, all the expenses and challenges associated with acquiring reliable, affordable, and high-quality financial data that would make it feasible to release this as a reasonably priced subscription-based app. Support: The associated investment in customer support. Based on how people were using my TestFlight, it was going to be a significant investment to keep up with support, emails, maintenance, and ongoing feature development. However, part of this was likely due to complexity incurred from having to fix or skirt around unreliable data. There were lots of things I wanted to keep improving and refining with the app and that wouldn't end any time soon. If I were to release and charge for Stocketa, I would feel especially on the hook to resolve issues in a timely manner and that's not something I can accomodate now because of the next point. Time: And most importantly, I've found something more worthy of my complete focus and attention: Rewind AI. I sunk a lot of nights and weekends into Stocketa over the years. It consumed every spare moment, even taking over my occasional time writing blog posts here when I had something to share. That was something I really missed. Now, I would much rather be focusing my creative thinking time on how I can improve and grow Rewind. I originally started working on Stocketa with one goal: to learn Swift and SwiftUI my way with a project that was interesting to me. At the time that was scratching my own itch of keeping track of my investments. While it turned into a much larger and unshipped project, I learned a ton about native iOS development and was able to push myself creatively. These days I'm happiest investing my design, product and development time into Rewind AI, where my SwiftUI knowledge learned with Stocketa has been tremendously helpful. 1 I only had to go down to UIKit a few times. One time for things like custom text fields for more control over interactions, styling, text input, and formatting. Another to use a CollectionView for drag-to-reorder stocks. A third time for creating particle emitters in a few places, like confetti effects, as well as one area where I have some twinkling stars in a night illustration when the stock market is closed. And one last time to get more control over gestures. I needed to get a location when a long press begins and SwiftUI LongPressGesture() didn't provide that, so I used UILongPressGestureRecognizer instead.

And, fast-forward to the current day, I could effectively re-write the entire app - from scratch - in a weekend, due to the evolution of Apple&#x27;s platform dev tools and APIs over the last ~7 years + the mountains of Swift code and packages I&#x27;ve hacked and honed away at over the years.This type of project should be celebrated.

But, when it is more out of your control, it hits harder.I was young, I spent all my nights and even my whole summer holiday thinking&#x2F;coding. I dreamed about the success or career it will bring with my friend.Then it was a success and we were generating some ad revenue, which was great & much needed for two university students. The money was absorbed by our lives like water dripping onto dry soil. The morale was high, there was an air of optimism for the future!It was an android app, and one day, I woke up with my friend&#x27;s call. He was literally crying because the google algorithm deleted and banned our account, without any explanation or recourse. You are right that it never goes away, I can still feel the pain.After that, I remember walking up and down a popular and long street with my friend, without speaking much and trying to process \"end of the adventure\" feeling. Not related to google we had other human&#x2F;life problems in our lives and the simple hope we thought we built for ourselves was also gone. I was heartbroken and lost all my enthusiasm for mobile development.I still wonder what would happen if I could continue down that path, with initial little success, enough money to survive as a student, and an opportunity to build upon that... It is just a parallel universe now. Google could delete our app, but guide us to the right path. If I could know the rules, I could continue and be a good citizen in google&#x27;s walled garden. While spammers can always found a way, and find motivation with their low-effort tries... google lost a developer with good intentions. I don&#x27;t think it had any effect on the algorithm or overall corporate strategy.On the bright side, this event thought me to never trust a business partnership where I can not shake hands with a human that I trust and who geniunely wants my success&#x2F;not treat me as some replaceable number. (Also insert some rant about why AI overlords can be harmful and why human history created law-based order with human judgement...)I think it happened over 10 years ago, I can&#x27;t even pay money to use a Google service now :) I don&#x27;t change my email, just so that it reminds me this lesson. But if I was a scammer&#x2F;spammer I would find many solutions to circumvent google AI. I tried contacting via forms when I couldn&#x27;t pay for a service and when I felt like doing so. Surprisingly, in some cases I could even reach some people via these official channels. Alas, they are powerless, they had to give template answers. I assume the last word is spoken by the Algorithm, and I&#x27;m banned for life :)Overall, It is the first time I wrote about this online. I hope it helps a little. I should also say that I have no hard feelings for people working at google, they brought us great value over the years. But the brand of the company will always remind me those days, and I will always upvote when someone criticize google :) (What power do I have as a little, disposable developer? ;) ) And, no you can&#x27;t escape by changing your name to Alphabet or Alphabet soup... reply namanyayg 3 hours agorootparentWhat did your app do?

Because there are so many apps that I feel that way about. Where I just wish there was a version that was crap free. The amount of work that went into this is awe inspiring.I launched a much simpler iOS app, and eventually got up to around 1000 DAU organically, but ultimately closed it down because I had 1 IAP to remove ads for like $1.99 or $2.99. I was making maybe $70 a month or something, and dealing with bug reports. SwiftUI was not mature enough yet to use, so I was still using UIKit and I would constantly run into really hard to fix edge cases.The thing that made me throw in the towel was when Google claimed I was clicking my own ads and stopped serving them, effectively cutting off all revenue. It made me realize I&#x27;d worked so hard to build this thing, and it was all at the whims of these tech giants. Apple gets a 30% cut (this was before they dropped it to 15% if you are doing under x amount per year \"because COVID\") of every IAP, I make peanuts from ads and Google can turn those off for no reason with no way to appeal.I also wasn&#x27;t trying to make a bunch of money off the app, but I needed to justify spending my time and energy on it and I just couldn&#x27;t. reply crtified 11 hours agoprevSo too might think the bedroom musician of 20 years, who never performs or releases, or the childhood sportsperson who never touches a ball again after age 18.

However, if I can manage to change my mentality about market testing and quick, dirty iteration, I know that provides a much better foundation for letting loose and focusing on the craft. reply leobg 2 hours agoparentI feel the same way. reply mndgs 13 hours agoprevI feel you... I&#x27;m still building a banking backend(core, accouting, clients, accounts, payments (sepa + cards), notifications (servicenow-like), sanctions screening, risk&#x2F;monitoring engine, event flow, reporting), 5 years and counting... Beginning to wonder if I&#x27;m crazy or stupid to take on this gygantic undertaking.. and we&#x27;re yet to design a landing page. With smth like 150k LOC... reply HyprMusic 12 hours agoparentAs someone in this space, I highly recommend you start engaging with your potential customers and building trust ASAP. It took us a lot longer than 5 years to gain enough trust to convince our customers over to our core banking platform - despite their existing platforms being fraught with bugs, limitations and insecurities. reply mndgs 3 hours agorootparentWe are sort-of scouting the area with a few potential small prospects.. the feedback so far is very positive, but none have committed cash on the table. Hard sales process is expected and at the same unnerving: we&#x27;re in b2b market and a narrow, highly specialized niche - finding the right clients is tough (and we don&#x27;t have the cash and&#x2F;or time for that). reply gverrilla 11 hours agorootparentprevHave you got some text describing the process of building trust, by any chance? I&#x27;m going through a similar challenge (but it&#x27;s on agriculture instead of banking): 3 years in, trying to build trust with large clients. reply HyprMusic 9 hours agorootparentI think the thing that helped the most is we built great relationships with our small clients. We convinced them to let us observe their day to day, speak to staff etc. From that we got an intimate idea of all their biggest pain points and we were able to offer complimentary products that worked with their existing core banking (and abstracted it wherever possible). Things like secure communications, document management, form builders - things we were planning on building after our core banking but were actually a bigger pain point for them. It made such a difference to the actual staff that they would be bragging about us at conferences and networking events. Eventually the word spread in the community&#x2F;industry and soon enough the big clients went from ignoring our calls to asking for \"exactly what they have\" (referring to the small clients who took the risk innovating).TLDR: Try starting with easier to sell, complimentary products. Focus on the smaller clients as they&#x27;re more willing to innovate. Do such a good job that they can&#x27;t help but brag. reply mndgs 3 hours agorootparentThis resonates with the strategy I&#x27;ve been trying to pivot our project to: instead of trying to sell all-in-one solution for large-&#x2F;mid-size bank (easily 100K+ in revenue per case), rather \"productize\" smaller tools, make them understandable and easily accessible to a wider, smaller range of clients. Example: FATCA&#x2F;CRS reporting - a thing that any fintech&#x2F;bank&#x2F;insurance company needs to do (and hates ); we give a tool which eliminates 80% of the hassle, just get your reportable client list.So, I on the right path? reply thefounder 12 hours agoparentprevI built an ecommerce solution with payments, REST messaging, email servers(imap&#x2F;smtp) and affiliate advertising(with its own payments, reporting, ACLs etc) as well.

There&#x27;s no standard what they need or must have - rather depends on the size of the risk, resources available at their disposal. Which often is a result of whether they have ever been hacked or not. A lot of banks never have been and feel they are invincible, and that shows in their security&#x2F;redundancy measures.\"where the money is stored\".. that one. In a nutshell, 99% of people (HN crowd including) do not understand, what is money in a bank, imagine it like some kind of electronic vault, which you as a client can access securely and transfer it (semi physically). Money in a bank does not exist. An IT guy would say \"it&#x27;s bits and bites, nothing more\". A finance guy would say that it is a web of collaterals and liabilities. Simple example: 100 clients each open accounts with a bank and deposit 100 EUR; bank has 10&#x27;000 EUR assets and 10&#x27;000 EUR liabilities (it owes 10K to its customers); bank deposits that money, say, with TARGET2 interbank gross-settlement system (which again has accounts with other banks), so its clients can make&#x2F;get credit transfers. So, as soon as money is deposited, it gets transferred to other parties, pledged, lent or invested - it is almost never \"in the bank\". So there&#x27;s little to steal. Even if you do, the trouble is that somebody&#x27;s asset is typically another party&#x27;s liability (and vice versa), i.e. stuff is recorded by different actors - and all that can be traced back, you can&#x27;t hack into all of them. Hence, stealing bank&#x27;s funds without a trace is close to impossible.

The animations just feel so satisfying.Market data is extremely complicated and I&#x27;ve seen so many get fooled into thinking it&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s understandable, if you can google any stock and get the price, you&#x27;d assume the data is free or public domain or something like that right? Maybe a small fee at most to power an API to get it. For those wondering, it tends to go like this:You look into it and it&#x27;s not quite so simple... the exchanges, like most financial services, are stuck in the past... but theres a cool website called IEX that is \"revolutionizing\" market data and can provide stock data for fairly cheap.It looks like your idea might work, until you realize something is off with IEX&#x27;s data. The prices aren&#x27;t very accurate. Well it is accurate actually, only for stock trades that take place on IEX. Not NASDAQ. Not NYSE. Turns out the price of a stock that users expect is actually the last trade across ALL of the major stock exchanges.Surely there is a way to get the \"consolidated\" price that reflects all exchanges? Not just IEX&#x27;s measly 2% of volume? There&#x27;s what is called the \"consolidated tape\" which is just that. Wait just kidding. It&#x27;s \"consolidated\" but requires you enter into agreements with two separate organizations called CTA and UTP, also known as SIPs (security information processors). These are the only companies allowed to license the data, so they set the prices extremely high, starting at thousands of dollars per month.Well, maybe you could deal with that if your app gets enough traction. There&#x27;s more though... you can&#x27;t actually get the data from CTA or UTP. You have to have a \"vendor\" do it for you, and pass on the data. The vendor is essentially a wrapper around the SIP that handles distributing the data to end-companies (not end-users, because realistically very little individuals can afford this, and vendors aren&#x27;t too interested in dealing with individuals). Since the vendor focuses on the distribution, you&#x27;d assume their API would be top-notch. Instead you can tell it&#x27;s built upon layers and layers of technical debt and edge cases. Oh well.So, you then pay for the licenses from the SIPs, and the data from the vendor. You are now burning at least 10k a month. You get your first user, and they complain they can&#x27;t find \"SPX\", the largest stock index in the world. Oops. It turns out indices, futures, options, and other securities, are all separate SIPs. You have to deal with even more backwards organizations to get licenses for each type of security. Don&#x27;t forget the vendor wants another couple thousand for each SIP, more if you need realtime streaming or historical charting. Maybe just get indexes since they are popular? Indexes are once again spread across tens of organizations, depending on who owns the IP for the index. At this point you give up and just focus on U.S. stocks for now, until you get more funding.Then one day, you are selected for a \"random\" audit by the SIP. They ask for personal information on every user you have, and claim that some users are actually financial professionals (such as a CFA or stock broker). They try to fine you 50x the price you expected because some users happen to have the same names as professional traders. (They charge a massive amount per professional trader vs per \"ordinary\" person) You have to deal with explaining what that even means and why it&#x27;s important to your users to try to avoid this fine. Maybe your application was used on TV, or over the phone, or even on an elevator. There are different licenses for that. Ridiculous? Well, the SIP is authorized by the SEC to distribute the data, and enforce it. You have no upper hand in any negotiation.To be continued in blog post someday maybeFWIW, your new project already has some good traction.

    "originLink": "https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479",
    "originBody": "Current Issue Past Issues Topics April 30, 2018 Volume 16, issue 2 PDF C Is Not a Low-level Language Your computer is not a fast PDP-11. David Chisnall In the wake of the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities, it's worth spending some time looking at root causes. Both of these vulnerabilities involved processors speculatively executing instructions past some kind of access check and allowing the attacker to observe the results via a side channel. The features that led to these vulnerabilities, along with several others, were added to let C programmers continue to believe they were programming in a low-level language, when this hasn't been the case for decades. Processor vendors are not alone in this. Those of us working on C/C++ compilers have also participated. What Is a Low-Level Language? Computer science pioneer Alan Perlis defined low-level languages this way: \"A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.\"5 While, yes, this definition applies to C, it does not capture what people desire in a low-level language. Various attributes cause people to regard a language as low-level. Think of programming languages as belonging on a continuum, with assembly at one end and the interface to the Starship Enterprise's computer at the other. Low-level languages are \"close to the metal,\" whereas high-level languages are closer to how humans think. For a language to be \"close to the metal,\" it must provide an abstract machine that maps easily to the abstractions exposed by the target platform. It's easy to argue that C was a low-level language for the PDP-11. They both described a model in which programs executed sequentially, in which memory was a flat space, and even the pre- and post-increment operators cleanly lined up with the PDP-11 addressing modes. Fast PDP-11 Emulators The root cause of the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities was that processor architects were trying to build not just fast processors, but fast processors that expose the same abstract machine as a PDP-11. This is essential because it allows C programmers to continue in the belief that their language is close to the underlying hardware. C code provides a mostly serial abstract machine (until C11, an entirely serial machine if nonstandard vendor extensions were excluded). Creating a new thread is a library operation known to be expensive, so processors wishing to keep their execution units busy running C code rely on ILP (instruction-level parallelism). They inspect adjacent operations and issue independent ones in parallel. This adds a significant amount of complexity (and power consumption) to allow programmers to write mostly sequential code. In contrast, GPUs achieve very high performance without any of this logic, at the expense of requiring explicitly parallel programs. The quest for high ILP was the direct cause of Spectre and Meltdown. A modern Intel processor has up to 180 instructions in flight at a time (in stark contrast to a sequential C abstract machine, which expects each operation to complete before the next one begins). A typical heuristic for C code is that there is a branch, on average, every seven instructions. If you wish to keep such a pipeline full from a single thread, then you must guess the targets of the next 25 branches. This, again, adds complexity; it also means that an incorrect guess results in work being done and then discarded, which is not ideal for power consumption. This discarded work has visible side effects, which the Spectre and Meltdown attacks could exploit. On a modern high-end core, the register rename engine is one of the largest consumers of die area and power. To make matters worse, it cannot be turned off or power gated while any instructions are running, which makes it inconvenient in a dark silicon era when transistors are cheap but powered transistors are an expensive resource. This unit is conspicuously absent on GPUs, where parallelism again comes from multiple threads rather than trying to extract instruction-level parallelism from intrinsically scalar code. If instructions do not have dependencies that need to be reordered, then register renaming is not necessary. Consider another core part of the C abstract machine's memory model: flat memory. This hasn't been true for more than two decades. A modern processor often has three levels of cache in between registers and main memory, which attempt to hide latency. The cache is, as its name implies, hidden from the programmer and so is not visible to C. Efficient use of the cache is one of the most important ways of making code run quickly on a modern processor, yet this is completely hidden by the abstract machine, and programmers must rely on knowing implementation details of the cache (for example, two values that are 64-byte-aligned may end up in the same cache line) to write efficient code. Optimizing C One of the common attributes ascribed to low-level languages is that they're fast. In particular, they should be easy to translate into fast code without requiring a particularly complex compiler. The argument that a sufficiently smart compiler can make a language fast is one that C proponents often dismiss when talking about other languages. Unfortunately, simple translation providing fast code is not true for C. In spite of the heroic efforts that processor architects invest in trying to design chips that can run C code fast, the levels of performance expected by C programmers are achieved only as a result of incredibly complex compiler transforms. The Clang compiler, including the relevant parts of LLVM, is around 2 million lines of code. Even just counting the analysis and transform passes required to make C run quickly adds up to almost 200,000 lines (excluding comments and blank lines). For example, in C, processing a large amount of data means writing a loop that processes each element sequentially. To run this optimally on a modern CPU, the compiler must first determine that the loop iterations are independent. The C restrict keyword can help here. It guarantees that writes through one pointer do not interfere with reads via another (or if they do, that the programmer is happy for the program to give unexpected results). This information is far more limited than in a language such as Fortran, which is a big part of the reason that C has failed to displace Fortran in high-performance computing. Once the compiler has determined that loop iterations are independent, then the next step is to attempt to vectorize the result, because modern processors get four to eight times the throughput in vector code that they achieve in scalar code. A low-level language for such processors would have native vector types of arbitrary lengths. LLVM IR (intermediate representation) has precisely this, because it is always easier to split a large vector operation into smaller ones than to construct larger vector operations. Optimizers at this point must fight the C memory layout guarantees. C guarantees that structures with the same prefix can be used interchangeably, and it exposes the offset of structure fields into the language. This means that a compiler is not free to reorder fields or insert padding to improve vectorization (for example, transforming a structure of arrays into an array of structures or vice versa). That's not necessarily a problem for a low-level language, where fine-grained control over data structure layout is a feature, but it does make it harder to make C fast. C also requires padding at the end of a structure because it guarantees no padding in arrays. Padding is a particularly complex part of the C specification and interacts poorly with other parts of the language. For example, you must be able to compare two structs using a type-oblivious comparison (e.g., memcmp), so a copy of a struct must retain its padding. In some experimentation, a noticeable amount of total runtime on some workloads was found to be spent in copying padding (which is often awkwardly sized and aligned). Consider two of the core optimizations that a C compiler performs: SROA (scalar replacement of aggregates) and loop unswitching. SROA attempts to replace structs (and arrays with fixed lengths) with individual variables. This then allows the compiler to treat accesses as independent and elide operations entirely if it can prove that the results are never visible. This has the side effect of deleting padding in some cases but not others. The second optimization, loop unswitching, transforms a loop containing a conditional into a conditional with a loop in both paths. This changes flow control, contradicting the idea that a programmer knows what code will execute when low-level language code runs. It can also cause significant problems with C's notions of unspecified values and undefined behavior. In C, a read from an uninitialized variable is an unspecified value and is allowed to be any value each time it is read. This is important, because it allows behavior such as lazy recycling of pages: for example, on FreeBSD the malloc implementation informs the operating system that pages are currently unused, and the operating system uses the first write to a page as the hint that this is no longer true. A read to newly malloced memory may initially read the old value; then the operating system may reuse the underlying physical page; and then on the next write to a different location in the page replace it with a newly zeroed page. The second read from the same location will then give a zero value. If an unspecified value for flow control is used (for example, using it as the condition in an if statement), then the result is undefined behavior: anything is allowed to happen. Consider the loop-unswitching optimization, this time in the case where the loop ends up being executed zero times. In the original version, the entire body of the loop is dead code. In the unswitched version, there is now a branch on the variable, which may be uninitialized. Some dead code has now been transformed into undefined behavior. This is just one of many optimizations that a close investigation of the C semantics shows to be unsound. In summary, it is possible to make C code run quickly but only by spending thousands of person-years building a sufficiently smart compiler—and even then, only if you violate some of the language rules. Compiler writers let C programmers pretend that they are writing code that is \"close to the metal\" but must then generate machine code that has very different behavior if they want C programmers to keep believing that they are using a fast language. Understanding C One of the key attributes of a low-level language is that programmers can easily understand how the language's abstract machine maps to the underlying physical machine. This was certainly true on the PDP-11, where each C expression mapped trivially to one or two instructions. Similarly, the compiler performed a straightforward lowering of local variables to stack slots and mapped primitive types to things that the PDP-11 could operate on natively. Since then, implementations of C have had to become increasingly complex to maintain the illusion that C maps easily to the underlying hardware and gives fast code. A 2015 survey of C programmers, compiler writers, and standards committee members raised several issues about the comprehensibility of C.3 For example, C permits an implementation to insert padding into structures (but not into arrays) to ensure that all fields have a useful alignment for the target. If you zero a structure and then set some of the fields, will the padding bits all be zero? According to the results of the survey, 36 percent were sure that they would be, and 29 percent didn't know. Depending on the compiler (and optimization level), it may or may not be. This is a fairly trivial example, yet a significant proportion of programmers either believe the wrong thing or are not sure. When you introduce pointers, the semantics of C become a lot more confusing. The BCPL model was fairly simple: values are words. Each word is either some data or the address of some data. Memory is a flat array of storage cells indexed by address. The C model, in contrast, was intended to allow implementation on a variety of targets, including segmented architectures (where a pointer might be a segment ID and an offset) and even garbage-collected virtual machines. The C specification is careful to restrict valid operations on pointers to avoid problems for such systems. The response to Defect Report 2601 included the notion of pointer provenance in the definition of pointer: \"Implementations are permitted to track the origins of a bit pattern and treat those representing an indeterminate value as distinct from those representing a determined value. They may also treat pointers based on different origins as distinct even though they are bitwise identical.\" Unfortunately, the word provenance does not appear in the C11 specification at all, so it is up to compiler writes to decide what it means. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and Clang, for example, differ on whether a pointer that is converted to an integer and back retains its provenance through the casts. Compilers are free to determine that two pointers to different malloc results or stack allocations always compare as not-equal, even when a bitwise comparison of the pointers may show them to describe the same address. These misunderstandings are not purely academic in nature. For example, security vulnerabilities have been observed from signed integer overflow (undefined behavior in C) and from code that dereferenced a pointer before a null check, indicating to the compiler that the pointer could not be null because dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior in C and therefore can be assumed not to happen (https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1897). In light of such issues, it is difficult to argue that a programmer can be expected to understand exactly how a C program will map to an underlying architecture. Imagining a Non-C Processor The proposed fixes for Spectre and Meltdown impose significant performance penalties, largely offsetting the advances in microarchitecure in the past decade. Perhaps it's time to stop trying to make C code fast and instead think about what programming models would look like on a processor designed to be fast. We have a number of examples of designs that have not focused on traditional C code to provide some inspiration. For example, highly multithreaded chips, such as Sun/Oracle's UltraSPARC Tx series, don't require as much cache to keep their execution units full. Research processors2 have extended this concept to very large numbers of hardware-scheduled threads. The key idea behind these designs is that with enough high-level parallelism, you can suspend the threads that are waiting for data from memory and fill your execution units with instructions from others. The problem with such designs is that C programs tend to have few busy threads. ARM's SVE (Scalar Vector Extensions)—and similar work from Berkeley4—provides another glimpse at a better interface between program and hardware. Conventional vector units expose fixed-sized vector operations and expect the compiler to try to map the algorithm to the available unit size. In contrast, the SVE interface expects the programmer to describe the degree of parallelism available and relies on the hardware to map it down to the available number of execution units. Using this from C is complex, because the autovectorizer must infer the available parallelism from loop structures. Generating code for it from a functional-style map operation is trivial: the length of the mapped array is the degree of available parallelism. Caches are large, but their size isn't the only reason for their complexity. The cache coherency protocol is one of the hardest parts of a modern CPU to make both fast and correct. Most of the complexity involved comes from supporting a language in which data is expected to be both shared and mutable as a matter of course. Consider in contrast an Erlang-style abstract machine, where every object is either thread-local or immutable (Erlang has a simplification of even this, where there is only one mutable object per thread). A cache coherency protocol for such a system would have two cases: mutable or shared. A software thread being migrated to a different processor would need its cache explicitly invalidated, but that's a relatively uncommon operation. Immutable objects can simplify caches even more, as well as making several operations even cheaper. Sun Labs' Project Maxwell noted that the objects in the cache and the objects that would be allocated in a young generation are almost the same set. If objects are dead before they need to be evicted from the cache, then never writing them back to main memory can save a lot of power. Project Maxwell proposed a young-generation garbage collector (and allocator) that would run in the cache and allow memory to be recycled quickly. With immutable objects on the heap and a mutable stack, a garbage collector becomes a very simple state machine that is trivial to implement in hardware and allows for more efficient use of a relatively small cache. A processor designed purely for speed, not for a compromise between speed and C support, would likely support large numbers of threads, have wide vector units, and have a much simpler memory model. Running C code on such a system would be problematic, so, given the large amount of legacy C code in the world, it would not likely be a commercial success. There is a common myth in software development that parallel programming is hard. This would come as a surprise to Alan Kay, who was able to teach an actor-model language to young children, with which they wrote working programs with more than 200 threads. It comes as a surprise to Erlang programmers, who commonly write programs with thousands of parallel components. It's more accurate to say that parallel programming in a language with a C-like abstract machine is difficult, and given the prevalence of parallel hardware, from multicore CPUs to many-core GPUs, that's just another way of saying that C doesn't map to modern hardware very well.

Seacord - Uninitialized Reads Most developers understand that reading uninitialized variables in C is a defect, but some do it anyway. What happens when you read uninitialized objects is unsettled in the current version of the C standard (C11).3 Various proposals have been made to resolve these issues in the planned C2X revision of the standard. Consequently, this is a good time to understand existing behaviors as well as proposed revisions to the standard to influence the evolution of the C language. Given that the behavior of uninitialized reads is unsettled in C11, prudence dictates eliminating uninitialized reads from your code. © ACM, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",

Especially with modern hardware, memory management is at the center of programming. For example, Rust prides itself in being memory safe without a garbage collector, memory management is more or less the entire reason for Rust to exist. Why is C fast? Memory. Why is C unsafe? Mostly memory. One of the big reason parallel computing is hard? Concurrent memory access. Functional programming is often surrounded by plenty of mathematical concepts, but a good part of it is to pretend that objects are immutable when behind the scenes, the compiler works with mutable memory.In C, every call to the allocator is explicit, that is, if you are using an allocator at all. Compare to oldschool C++, with new&#x2F;delete and raw pointers, where you may call the allocator explicitly, but still, a lot happen in destructors, automatically. In modern C++, with smart pointers, it is essentially like a garbage collected language in the sense that allocation and deallocation all happen automatically. reply grotorea 19 hours agoparent> C is low level for at least one reason: manual memory management. Especially with modern hardware, memory management is at the center of programming.Ok, but even with C we can&#x27;t actually low level manage memory how the processor does it. You can&#x27;t tell the processor what to keep or not on what level of cache, what to send to virtual memory, etc. It&#x27;s lower level than say Python but I don&#x27;t think it is low level memory management in the way PDP-11 C was. reply ilyt 18 hours agorootparent> Ok, but even with C we can&#x27;t actually low level manage memory how the processor does it.

It&#x27;s a feature for communicating with non coherent devices to tell the cache that any lines it might have speculatively loaded might have changed out from under it.\"Not being worth\" reads like cache perf management, as opposed to uses of DC CIVAC, which are strict correctness issues. reply bjourne 17 hours agorootparentprevIntrinsics are not part of C though. C is the abstract machine defined in various specs and its syntax and semantics. reply monocasa 15 hours agorootparentC is as much its implementations as it is its spec. And the spec came much later than the implementations, and really was designed as a common subset. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentAny language can have intrisics, C is not a special snowflake.So if intrisics count, than any language goes. reply xscott 18 hours agorootparentprevAny of those instructions could be wrapped in a C function or intrinsic if they were valuable enough reply nuancebydefault 13 hours agorootparentWrapping other languages does not count when describing the hight-of-level of a language. In almost any language you can embed machine code, even in spoken languages.It would be like &#x27;English is not easier than Chinese, since I can quote a Chinese sentence in English.&#x27; reply jowea 10 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a bit of a difference in that C has ways to closely integrate assembly as needed. Most languages don&#x27;t. reply pjmlp 2 hours agorootparentThey aren&#x27;t part of C, they are compiler specific extensions.Any language can have compiler specific extensions.Playing fair game, all non toy languages can load modules written in Assembly.In fact that was the only way in K&R C, compiler extensions came later. replyquatrevingts 18 hours agorootparentprevAs the article notes, that&#x27;s because CPUs are designed to run existing C code fast. You could create an instruction set that provided this control, but it might be a tough sell in a world full of C code. reply Chabsff 19 hours agorootparentprevA lot of that is just a property of modern OSs, with good reason, intentionally not exposing these features to userspace processes. It&#x27;s not really a function of the language itself. reply grotorea 19 hours agorootparentHmm, true for virtual memory, didn&#x27;t think of that, but CPU caches are inside the processor, can even the kernel control it at all? reply Chabsff 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not really a question of whether or not it&#x27;s feasible, but rather: If the hardware were supports such operations, would they be expressible within the language? If they are, then we should point at the accessibility of the functionality rather than C.In this case, I could definitely see `set_cache_behavior(ptr, len, options)` being perfectly reasonable, so I&#x27;d argue that, again, the fact that we can&#x27;t do it is more a property of the environment than the language itself. reply theamk 18 hours agorootparentprevThe reference point for when we talk about low memory languages is not transistor but rather machine code. In this aspect we say that C is low level because one pointer dereference in C translates directly into memory load of machine code.The fact that modern memory load operation involves cache, protection, memory mapping, etc.. is not a property of language, but rather of the environment (CPU + OS). reply grotorea 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s fair enough, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the most useful that it can be then. Low level to me could mean that we control all the details. But modern processors have microcode between transistors and the x86 machine code. And we can&#x27;t control all that memory stuff.But those aren&#x27;t abstractions that we can treat as black boxes, we need to know them and how to code taking them into account without actually having control inside the black box. reply wang_li 19 hours agorootparentprevYou can control what goes into cache if you want to.

They&#x27;re an abstraction not just over hardware (that doesn&#x27;t have anything bytewise allocated like that), they even abstract away the way operating systems allocate memory.You don&#x27;t get direct access to the stack in C either. Stack frames are abstracted away, and you only get longjmp.If you pay attention to Undefined Behavior and strict aliasing, you don&#x27;t even get that much access to poking around memory. reply pjmlp 19 hours agoparentprevBASIC also can do manual memory management, not only that, it had a whole computer generation for itself, in computers not able to have a full ISO C implementation. reply theamk 18 hours agorootparentSo does Python (via ctypes) and pretty much every language we consider \"high level\". But in BASIC your default approach is \"DIM names$(count)\" which \"magically\" manages your memory for you.. which is why we consider it higher level than C. reply pjmlp 18 hours agorootparentThat is hardly different from malloc(count * size), REDIM exists (aka realloc()) and many BASICs do offer the free variant as well.In fact, there is hardly any difference between VMS BASIC and VMS C in terms of what is possible, if we want to take the discussion outside of 8 bit versions. reply marcosdumay 19 hours agoparentprev> Why is C unsafe? Mostly memory.C can&#x27;t even do all of integral arithmetic safely. It&#x27;s a language that goes really out of its way to add unsafety. reply bensecure 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure that this is one of the unsafeties that rust borrows from c, even as it attempts to eliminate all the others. Checking every addition adds a massive slowdown, without giving much useful protection against vulns or corruption. reply Hirrolot 18 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is one of the unsafeties that rust borrows from cBut integer arithmetic is safe in terms of Rust.> Checking every addition adds a massive slowdownIt only does so for debug mode. In release mode, it uses modular arithmetic. reply Chabsff 18 hours agorootparent> It only does so for debug mode. In release mode, it uses modular arithmetic.So it&#x27;s still treated as an error, just one that has a predictable fallback. I&#x27;m really not sure how that&#x27;s much different from `-fsanitize=undefined`. Broken code is broken, even if it breaks in a predictable manner.Now if the modular arithmetic had been enshrined as the expected behavior without being treated like an error to be caught, it&#x27;d be another matter. reply marcosdumay 18 hours agorootparentAn error does not rewrite your entire code on the assumption that it can not happen.Signed overflow is not an error in C. reply Chabsff 16 hours agorootparentI meant error \"in the code\".A chunk of C that causes a signed overflow has an error in it. Seemingly, so does Rust code according to the behavior described in the post I was replying to.My point is that I question how big is the value gain from having a predictable fallback when we are already within the realm of \"this code is considered wrong\". This isn&#x27;t unlike the various arguments against the value of compiler warnings.That being said, I agree that it&#x27;s preferable in general, but the difference seems rather marginal to me. That is, within the context of what I&#x27;m replying to. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Rust had a few additional tricks up its sleeve to address this. reply marcosdumay 14 hours agorootparentYou really mean the usual C reasoning of \"if this program has an error, what difference does it makes if it returns the wrong value or formats the main disk\" (With an implicit \"I see none\" added on the end)?Because a caught static error, a runtime error, a wrong value, and C&#x27;s UB are completely different beasts. reply uecker 14 hours agorootparentI think modular behavior at run-time is actively dangerous. It is not memory-unsafe, but still unsafe. Having it trap would better. For C, you can tell the compiler to trap for signed overflow. reply marcosdumay 12 hours agorootparentIMO, that&#x27;s a job for the type system. But if you can only have one option, clearly an error is the best one.Anyway, none of those are anything nearly as damaging as C&#x27;s UB. All of them are reasonable, on the literal sense that you can reason about them, anticipate what your program may do, and defend against the problem (or shrug it off and claim \"it doesn&#x27;t matter here\"). You can do neither with by the spec C. reply jstimpfle 16 hours agorootparentprevThat should just be a matter of a compiler knob, no? Such as -fsanitize=undefined (which is the sledge hammer, but there could be more fine grained ones). reply imtringued 1 hour agorootparentIt&#x27;s not. There is no sanitizer on embedded platforms and it turns out, I only use C on embedded platforms, which for me means the UB sanitizer doesn&#x27;t exist. reply estebank 18 hours agorootparentprev> But integer arithmetic is safe in terms of Rust.To expand on this: integer overflow is not UB, it is unspecified. It can result in clamping, wrapping or a panic, depending on configuration at compile time.> In release mode, it uses modular arithmetic.And I believe that to have been a mistake. Android enables overflow checks by default and there is no measurable performance impact. reply xscott 18 hours agorootparentprevLol, when C does it, it&#x27;s \"unsafe\". When Rust does it, it&#x27;s \"modular\"! reply mathiaskindberg 18 hours agorootparentFor anyone wondering about the term \"modular\":> In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers \"wrap around\" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Modular_arithmetic reply nuancebydefault 13 hours agorootparentModular&#x2F;modulus (and also twos complement) is a natural feature of most CPUs. It comes natural by the way logic counters work in hardware. C enforces that by not touching that logic. Rust is the same in that respect. Python on the other hand treats integers as objects with a virtually unlimited amount of digits. That said, float&#x2F;double precision and logic is still CPU dependent and is used as-is for most languages. reply marcosdumay 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s astonishing the number of people defending the C \"ideals\" that demonstrate ignorance about what C actually does. (Is it artificial,in order to willingly miss the point?)Only some of the integral types in C are modular. If they all where, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. reply xscott 15 hours agorootparentNo, what&#x27;s astonishing is that now that every CPU worth using has 2&#x27;s complement for signed integers, the compiler writers are still embracing undefined behavior in the name of piddly optimizations.I was tempted to specify \"unsigned\" to ward off the obnoxious pedants, and I see that I should have. C really should be a portable assembly language by now. A very small non-breaking change to the standard, and C&#x27;s arithmetic would be the same as Rust&#x27;s. reply marcosdumay 14 hours agorootparent> No, what&#x27;s astonishing is that now that every CPU worth using has 2&#x27;s complement for signed integers, the compiler writers are still embracing undefined behavior in the name of piddly optimizations.Yeah, that&#x27;s also astonishing.Anyway, I&#x27;ve stopped blaming the C developers by now. I just assume they have the goal of killing the language and moving people into a more ergonomic alternative. I don&#x27;t know their true intentions, but this has been a very predictive assumption.(I guess any definition of any UB would be non-breaking, so yeah, they could fix all of the language.) reply xscott 14 hours agorootparent> I just assume they have the goal of killing the languageSadly, that&#x27;s my conclusion too. I really wish there was a good \"portable assembly language\", and maybe that&#x27;ll be something that targets WASM. reply cozzyd 12 hours agorootparentprevthen use -fwrapv if that&#x27;s what you want... reply nicoburns 17 hours agorootparentprevC and Rust do very different things in this case. C defines overflow of signed integers to be Undefined Behaviour. Whereas in Rust it either wraps (release mode) or panics (debug mode). reply jstimpfle 16 hours agorootparentAny specific C compiler could do the same in complete agreement with the C standard.There isn&#x27;t a guarantee that any given standards-conforming compiler will, but it seems that with Rust there isn&#x27;t a guarantee what behaviour you get either (it depends on the compile settings). In either language, you can&#x27;t write code that does signed overflow in a meaningful way (at least not if you use Debug). reply xscott 15 hours agorootparentI agree with your point, but note that Rust does have an ugly way to do it:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;std&#x2F;primitive.i64.html#method.wrap...I&#x27;d rather just put `-fwrapv` on the command line that clutter my code with crap like that though. reply nicoburns 14 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;d rather just put `-fwrapv` on the command line that clutter my code with crap like that though.The advantage of Rust&#x27;s way is that it lets you customise addition on a per-operation basis. So you can mix and match wrapping addition with saturating addition, etc. reply xscott 14 hours agorootparentYes, I can have functions&#x2F;methods that do math differently from the default. I could just as easily say that&#x27;s C&#x27;s way and mix and match those: int64_t x = add_i64_with_abort_on_debug_and_wrap_on_release(y, z); uint8_t t = add_u8_with_saturation(u, v);I&#x27;d prefer the default for the math operators be what all the CPUs currently do, and neither C or Rust promises that. reply xscott 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, so fix the C standard... But the compiler guys won&#x27;t let the anyone fix it, because optimizations.So either A) the optimizations using UB are important, and therefore C is&#x2F;will-always-be faster than Rust which doesn&#x27;t have them. Or B) the optimizations using UB are not important and the compiler writers for gcc and clang are wrong.You pick.And of course some insane people advocate for adding undefined behavior to Rust in the name of optimizations.

I use them as a matter of course. Also use -fno-strict-aliasing. reply Chabsff 18 hours agorootparentYes, you can tell the compiler to generate predictably-behaving output for non-compliant code. However, that code is not valid C anymore, but a dialect.Since this is a discussion about what C is and is not, I think it&#x27;s fair to limit ourselves to the actual language as-is. reply matheusmoreira 18 hours agorootparent> that code is not valid C anymore, but a dialect> I think it&#x27;s fair to limit ourselves to the actual language as-isI don&#x27;t agree. Standard C only ever seems to be discussed when some asinine undefined behavior starts causing problems that we have to work around. No one cares about it otherwise.It&#x27;s better to redefine C as whatever the compilers accept. Now we can actually move forward and actually fix problems such as \"signed integer overflow is undefined\" -- just tell the compilers to start dealing with it. reply andrewaylett 15 hours agorootparentBut they do deal with it -- by assuming it doesn&#x27;t happen. Wrap or trap don&#x27;t necessarily change that.At its heart, behaviour that&#x27;s undefined like this is a source of optimisation opportunities, because we tend (and especially the preprocessor tends) to write code that assumes it won&#x27;t happen. C does not lend itself well to iterator patterns that elide the range check entirely, and so it is valuable to the optimiser to be able to assume that a variable that steadily increments will not suddenly turn out to have wrapped. So we may (for example) unroll memory accesses[0], secure in our understanding that when we add 1 three times we will get three consecutive numbers, and (where we would normally add another 1) go ahead and add four at the end of the unrolled loop.If we trap at that point, the behaviour is different from if we accessed each memory location in turn and trapped when we actually wrapped around. In the C model, the behaviour is still clasically undefined, but we&#x27;ve added a trap to hopefully catch that it happened before running too much further. We still can&#x27;t assert anything about the state of the program after the trap, to potentially recover from it.People writing performance-sensitve code get frustrated when a compiler trades performance for safety, so we&#x27;re probably never going to get \"safe\" C in that sense. In practice though? This form of undefined behaviour only kicks in at runtime. Make sure your software is bug-free and you need never worry about it.[0]: Imagine you have a 16 bit signed int that you&#x27;re using as input into computing an index into an array -- you may know that it&#x27;s never going to overflow, but how do you tell the compiler? reply aidenn0 15 hours agorootparentprevCompilers are typically benchmarked with ubsan and friends turned off, so when we say \"C is fast\" [with undefined behavior enabled] and \"C is reasonably safe\" [with undefined behavior defined] we aren&#x27;t talking about the same language. reply aidenn0 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, what I really want is a trap on overflow, but since C doesn&#x27;t support that, modern architectures don&#x27;t have the capability; you can do it in software (like with ubsan), but you pay a performance penalty. reply matheusmoreira 17 hours agorootparentI mentioned the -fwrapv option to make it wrap around.

Rust (and to some extent C++) introduces some management abstractions in front of this in the form of references and borrowing, but the main concept is still there.In reality the kernel of your operating system has put a giant layer between you and the physical memory, and the \"address\" and \"pointer\" are really just handles behind which the OS and MMU do all sorts of shenanigans.\"Raw pointers\" really aren&#x27;t raw. They&#x27;re handles to offsets within pages, which can be all over the place.

They are \"raw\" in the sense that they&#x27;re just an integer number (not really on the C language level, but they have an integer representation on any actual target like x86) and that you have to synchronize these pointers with the lifetimes of \"actual\" objects, which are only an abstract concept that your computer doesn&#x27;t understand.Meanwhile, virtual memory is as close as you can get down to the physical hardware in terms of normal CPU instructions (i.e., not VM management code). VM as a concept is orthogonal to raw pointers, which can be either virtual or physical.Raw pointers are nothing like handles. They need to be manually \"synchronized\" properly with VM management (which happens completely behind the scenes for 99,99% of userspace code) to make sense but it&#x27;s not like there is bookkeeping overhead in copying or offseting a pointer, like there would be for a \"handle\".The point of a handle is that it&#x27;s use to hold objects, to keep them alive.

Manual memory management being faster than GC is a function of controlling memory layout, which is one of the (very) few low hanging optimization fruits that mortals like you or I can do on contemporary CPUs.That is kind of misleading. The difference is that C and Rust support stack allocation, which is essentially an arena style allocator integrated into the language. What the fancy pointer bumping GC runtimes do, the stack does by default. The problem is that escape analysis is difficult and it is difficult to prove that an access to memory on the stack is safe without fundamentally changing the language like Rust does. It gets worse on the heap, where you can have runtime determined ownership.C programmers like their doubly linked lists, but when you think about it, it is actually kind of a difficult problem to formalize and analyze in its full generality. reply jstimpfle 16 hours agorootparentprevLove your words. 1000 upvotes if I could.For balance, the faster machines get, the more problems are most effectively solved by throwing the kitchen sink at them. reply nineteen999 23 minutes agorootparentSometimes wasting a perfectly good kitchen sink on a small problem gives you two bigger problems. reply MrBuddyCasino 2 hours agorootparentprev> Manual memory management being faster than GC is a function of controlling memory layoutControl over memory layout and manually allocating and freeing memory are orthogonal issues.I can optimize memory layout in Java too by using primitive data types instead of pointer-chasing objects, or structs of arrays vs array of structs type of things in order to improve access patterns.

If you&#x27;re just calling malloc&#x2F;free or, in C++, calling new&#x2F;delete in constructors&#x2F;destructors (or using a class that does so, like std::vector), and nothing special, the garbage collector is probably allocating memory faster.> controlling memory layoutGarbage collectors can compact active memory into one contiguous location and adjust the active pointers to point there instead. You can&#x27;t do this in a language like C, because you can have arbitrary pointers to anything, and there&#x27;s no runtime indication of what&#x27;s a pointer or just an integer. You simply have to prevent memory fragmentation in the first place, which also complicates the logic of the program.For faster allocation in C, arena allocation based on object lifetimes can be used [1]; in generational garbage collectors, you get similar benefits, but it&#x27;s just done automatically. In fact, in that linked paper, they found that lifetime-based arena allocation improved the speed of their program (a C compiler) at the cost of increased memory allocation compared to naïve malloc() and free(), which is exactly what garbage collection does.As a result of compaction, memory allocation with garbage collection is just a pointer bump in the best case, whereas allocation with just malloc usually requires searching a free list or a tree.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.princeton.edu&#x2F;techreports&#x2F;1988&#x2F;191.pdf reply crabbone 19 hours agoparentprevC is neither fast nor low-level... none of these descriptors have any meaning.It&#x27;s a pointless discussion when you don&#x27;t care to explain how you use the words that obviously have many related but different ways to interpret them. reply pizlonator 21 hours agoprevFriendly local C programmer and compiler writer here to remind you that C definitely is a low level language for those who understand it and use it professionally.

WASM would similarly be \"wrong\" if I claimed it was a direct mapping to modern hardware, but that doesn&#x27;t make it \"high level\".(Although what really frustrates me about C isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s a bad mapping per se. It&#x27;s from the 1970s, what do you expect? And it is obviously still quite useful for many cases.

C&#x27;s semantics are serial but they contain implicit parallelism. The equivalent is that the parallel statement contains implicit sequentialism that the compiler can exploit to reduce the amount of book keeping needed by the CPU to schedule thousands of instructions at the same time. E.g. instead of having an explicit ready signal and blocking on it, the compiler can simply decide to split the parallel statement into two parallel statements, one executed after the other. Implicit sequentialism! A parallel statement implies that no aliasing writes are allowed to be performed. I don&#x27;t know what the analysis for that would look like, but in many common cases I would expect the parallel statement to be autovectorized quite reliably.>Even though that stuff happens in parallel, any instruction encoding is by necessity serial.

The fact that C has functions or structs has nothing to do with it being awful influence on designing hardware.Here are some reasons why C is awful.* It believes that volatile storage is uniform in terms of latency and throughput. This results in operating systems written with the same stupid idea: they only give you one system call to ask for memory, and you cannot tell what kind of memory you want. This in turn results in hardware being designed in such a way that an operating system can create the worthless \"abstraction\" of uniform random-access memory. And then you have swap, pmem GPU&#x27;s memory etc. And none of that has any good interface. And these are the products that despite the archaic and irrelevant concept of how computers are built have succeeded to a degree... Imagine all those which didn&#x27;t. Imagine those that weren&#x27;t even conceived of because the authors dismissed the very notion before giving the idea any kind of thinking.* It has no concept of parallelism. In its newer iterations it added atomics, but this is just a reflection of how hardware was coping with C&#x27;s lack of any way to deal with parallel code execution. C \"imagines\" a computer to have a CPU with a single core running a single thread, and that&#x27;s where program is executed.

Instead, the language is designed to make the developer think they&#x27;re operating on an embarassingly-sequential machine and only the vast amount of undefined behavior in the language spec allows the compiled output to be parallel.It&#x27;s the wrong abstraction for the job and properly using C in a way that takes advantage of it requires unlearning most of what people think they know about how the language works.

Reduce array to a value.\" Those are abstractions a programmer can look at and go \"Oh, the compiler will probably SIMD that, I should use it instead of a for loop.\" In contrast, C will auto-unroll loops. Unless it doesn&#x27;t.

For the time being, there doesn&#x27;t seem to exist such a thing, and I can&#x27;t imagine that the reason why not is C.

To solve practical problems, you need to combine logic&#x2F;arithmetic instructions serially to achieve the intended effect. Seems to me that it turned out that most degrees of freedom are more accidental than structured, and it&#x27;s not practical to manually specify them, when the majority of them are easily recoverable in an automated way.So that&#x27;s how you end up with that instruction-level parallelism that is worked out by the compiler and the CPU. reply shadowgovt 16 hours agorootparent> You could argue now that C has prevented CPUs from implementing these abstraction (because arguably, C cannot express them), but I would like to ask first how you think it should be done, and why it&#x27;s not a good idea to implement it on the language&#x2F;compiler level how it&#x27;s currently done?As I said top-thread, it&#x27;s to my aesthetic. These are all Turing-complete languages and you can, in theory, do whatever in any of them. But map-reduce-fold-etc make it much clearer, to my eye, that I&#x27;m operating on a blob of data with the same pattern, and it&#x27;s easier to map that in my brain to the idea \"The compiler should be able to SIMD this.\" Contrast with loops requiring me to look at a sequential operation and go \"I&#x27;ll trust the compiler will optimize this by unrolling and then deciding to SIMD some of this operation.\" The end-result is (handwaving implementation) the same, but the aesthetic differs.As you&#x27;ve noted, I&#x27;m not unable to do this in C or C++ or Rust (in fact, C++ is especially clever in how it can use templates to inline static implementations recursively so that the end result of, say, the dot product of two N-dimensional vectors is \"a1 x b1 + a2 x b2 + a3 x b3\" for arbitrary dimension, allowing the compiler to see that as one expression and maximize the chances it&#x27;ll choose to use SIMD to compute it). But getting there is so many layers of abstraction away (I had to stare at a lot of Boost code to learn that little fact about vector math) that the language gets in the way of predicting the parallelism.> If there comes up a new way that lets CPUs understand type theoryCPUs don&#x27;t understand type theory. Compilers do and they can take advantage of that additional data to do things like unroll and SIMD my loops right now. My annoyance isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s impossible, it&#x27;s that I&#x27;d rather the abstraction-to-concrete model be \"parallel, except sometimes serial if the CPU doesn&#x27;t have parallel instructions or we hit capacity on the pipelines,\" not the current model of \"serial, and maybe the compiler can figure out how to parallelize it for you.\"> To solve practical problems, you need to compile logic&#x2F;arithmetic instructions serially to achieve the intended effect... Seems to me that it turned out that most degrees of freedom are more accidental than structured, and it&#x27;s not practical to manually specify themI agree... Eventually. There&#x27;s a lot of parallelism allowed under-the-hood in the space between where most programmers think about their code, as evidenced by C&#x27;s undefined behavior for expression resolution with operators of the same precedence.Whether degrees of freedom evolved by accident is irrelevant to whether a new language could specify those parts of the system (sequential vs. intentionally-undefined ordering) explicitly. C, for example, has lots of undefined behavior around memory management; Rust constrains it. It&#x27;s up to the language designer what is bound and what is allowed to be an arbitrary implementation detail, intentionally left undefined to give flexibility to compilers.Even the modern x86 instruction set is a bit of a lie; under the hood, modern CPUs emulate it by taking chunks of instruction and data and breaking them down for simultaneous execution on multiple parallel pipelines (including some execution that never goes anywhere and is thrown away as a predictive miss). CPUs wouldn&#x27;t be nearly as fast as they are if they couldn&#x27;t do that.I&#x27;m not advocating for breaking the x86 abstraction; that&#x27;s a bit too ambitious. But I&#x27;d like to see a language take off that abandons the PDP-11 embarrassingly-serial era of mental model in favor of a parallel model. replyxscott 19 hours agorootparentprevI understand your point: Modern hardware tries REALLY hard to pretend it is a simple set of instructions executing one after another. For all the on the fly clever caching, micro-op translation, branch prediction, speculative execution, register renaming, and whatever else, it consistently presents a sane model to single threaded programs. It&#x27;s difficult to even see the magic under the hood if you tried, and it mostly shows up in unexpected performance discrepancies or race conditions for multi threaded programs. It&#x27;s all a huge charade...However, before dismissing this all as a bad mapping to an outdated 1970s model of computation, I&#x27;d like to see a good alternative. CUDA has clearly shown that there&#x27;s an acceptable model for massively parallel data sets, but that doesn&#x27;t handle branch heavy code very well at all. And FPGAs have a different approach for a completely different kind of problem, but I don&#x27;t know how you would expose what Apple, AMD, or Intel chips are doing under the hood and have it be at all manageable to the programmer. How is someone supposed to indicate what&#x27;s next when a pipeline stalls waiting on the previous operation or a cache miss? Is the programmer going to toss micro ops into separate execution units and wait for the results to come out the other side in arbitrary order? Is this an async&#x2F;await model for every addition or memory fetch? I think it would be complete spaghetti to even try, but I&#x27;d love to be shown I&#x27;m wrong.People get all excited trash talking Itanium, but I think it&#x27;s a lesson that if you try to expose any alternative to the 1970s model they&#x27;ll just bitch about how there are no sufficiently smart compilers. And of course it got scooped by AMD64 pretending to execute one instruction after another.And if there isn&#x27;t a good alternative, I think C (or Rust, or WASM) are a pretty good fit for what you&#x27;ve actually got to work with at the low level. reply fanf2 18 hours agorootparentItanium was the wrong design not because of the reasons you suggest, but because it assumed that good performance is something that can be statically baked into the object code, and therefore that there is such a thing as a sufficiently smart compiler for an explicitly parallel processor running general purpose code. But evidently the designers were wrong.Which is not to say that explicit parallelism is bad, it’s clearly useful for GPUs and vector code (and compiling to SVE is not too different from itanic). But it doesn’t work as well as dynamically discovered parallelism for non-vector code. reply xscott 18 hours agorootparentIt seems to me there&#x27;s some uncharted territory between \"massively parallel\" (GPU) and \"unpredictable branching\" (CPU), and the corpse of Itanium is laying there as a warning to anyone who would go exploring in that area.

You have direct access to the machine ISA, including the weirder status&#x2F;control registers and whatever trap&#x2F;syscall corresponds to. Assemblers are somewhat powerful - can define data layouts somewhat like structs, abstract some things behind macros, add pseudo-instructions to put friendlier names on some things. Maybe the ISA expects you to build constant integers out of arithmetic, the assembler can give you a &#x27;const&#x27; instruction which expands to said arithmetic.I have a pet theory that lisp macros over an assembler is the right high level language for systems programming but that hasn&#x27;t made it off the whiteboard yet. reply trealira 18 hours agorootparentThe problem is that assembly is CPU dependent. The benefit of a high-level language is that it&#x27;s CPU architecture independent.For smaller CPUs that can&#x27;t support all of C&#x27;s assumptions natively anyway, like the 6502, which can&#x27;t multiply or do floating point arithmetic, something like what you describe would likely be best. It reminds me of the COMFY 6502 compiler: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;270941.270947 reply JonChesterfield 18 hours agorootparentTherein lies the interesting design space, yeah. Control flow, data layout, semantics of basic blocks are sometimes target agnostic and sometimes not. Sometimes a div instruction needs to turn into a runtime call, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Sometimes you want explicit control of registers, sometimes any gpr is fine.Which I suppose yields the other language choice. Instead of C or assembly, write in something very like a compiler IR.

The variations required to fit a platform make them semi-incompatible. Also, only global scope, no types and no built-in threadsafe constructs are limiting.That&#x27;s not to say that a more lispy Forth wouldn&#x27;t be useful though, in that a concatenative syntax allows us to pass custom datastructures around like APL, and CPS (delimited continuations with lexically scoped dynamic binding would come from the lisp side (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;manuel&#x2F;wat-js).Memory management in Forth can handle multiple memory types eg. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flashforth.com&#x2F; so adding something like ref counting (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;zigalenarcic&#x2F;minilisp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;main.c) to handle the dynamic list side of things might mesh well.In any case, if you&#x27;re looking for a self hosting lisp that runs on bare metal, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;attila-lendvai&#x2F;maru has been out for a few years. reply pjmlp 19 hours agorootparentprevAssembly, or what ESPOL was already doing in 1961 a decade before C was even an idea, compiler intrisics.So taking out Assembly, any language can have hardware capabilities exposed as compiler intrisics, that is nothing special about C in that regard, only the one many people are commonly aware of because they don&#x27;t to be educated in compilers. reply giancarlostoro 20 hours agorootparentprevThe only one I can think of would-be Assembly, but I don&#x27;t do much low-level work, I code in much higher-level languages. Genuinely curious what the answer is. reply schwoll 19 hours agorootparentFor portability by far the vast majority will say C. In my experience the C compiler optimizer will do a lot with -O2 or -03 but it can&#x27;t always infer correct SIMD optimization for some operations and on occasion you have to drop down into x86_64 assembly. The idea is do most things in C and use __asm__ to write custom assembly instructions. With #defines around the assembly for each processor you plan on supporting you get the benefit of both C optimizers and portability across different CPUs as well as any future updates to the compiler in the future. But the compiler writers will say to use intrinsics and extended assembly rather than raw assembly because when you write raw assembly your code becomes a black box to the compiler and it can&#x27;t infer optimizations for your surrounding code that interfaces with the assembly. I think C with extended Asm is likely the most sane combination if you don&#x27;t mind the slightly ugly syntax and the fact that there could be differences between compilers. That being said, C with compiler intrinsics seems to be a happy compromise for those that don&#x27;t want to shift around registers and deal with the stack.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DontUseInlineAsmhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;gcc.gnu.org&#x2F;onlinedocs&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;Extended-Asm.htmlI don&#x27;t use Rust so I can&#x27;t comment on it but it also has compiler intrinsics + a memory safety model. It&#x27;s compiler is really dog slow last time I used it so I hope that has improved but nobody is really killing C any time soon, even if there&#x27;s enthusiasm for memory safety. Sooner or later you have to delve down into the depths of Narnia and you may as well get comfortable dealing with memory.My likely favorite combination is Python + C (for the speed stuff) + Intrinsics (for the really speed stuff). reply actionfromafar 19 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think there is one, and if there was, it would run the same risk of becoming anachronistic as C itself has.Besides, C and its compilers have very much influenced CPU designs and optimisations, so it’s a world with a feedback loop.Maybe the loop will weaken somewhat in the new LLM craze. reply jerf 19 hours agorootparentprevPer my last paragraph, I am not convinced about any of them.One of these days I really need to post my \"ideas for languages\" that I&#x27;ve got banging around on my hard drive, but one of them is \"a language that deals with the increasingly heterogeneous nature of the computer\". You&#x27;ve got the CPU, the GPU, efficiency cores, whoknows what else in the future (NN cores), and it&#x27;s only a small hop from there to consider other computers as resources too.Full disclosure: I have no idea whatsoever what this looks like. Especially in light of the fact that you need to build not just for the exact machine you&#x27;re developing on but for machines in the future as well. Some sort of model of what is being computed and some guestimate at the costs? (Something like an SQL query builder where you declare your goal and it does the computation about what resources to compute it with?) It&#x27;s also possible that the huge gulfs in performance between all these parts are just too large to bridge and manual scheduling of all these resources is just the only choice.Even just within a CPU it&#x27;s rather annoyingly difficult to use vector-based code in modern languages. Perhaps something like an array-based language, but one that discards that field&#x27;s bizarre love affair with single-character (if not outright Unicode) operators and can be read by a normal human, and just affords writing code in a style that SIMD becomes a sensible default rather than something the optimizer laboriously reverse engineers from your conventional imperative code. (Array based programming could really use a \"for humans\" version of those languages in general.)To some extent, just sitting down for a year to learn modern assembler and starting from the very, very bottom once again to build a high level language, rather than starting with C and building \"C, but ...\" which is pretty much every modern language being developed, would be an interesting exercise if nothing else.Another little example is I think Jai was supporting structures-of-arrays instead of arrays-of-structures, though I don&#x27;t know if they kept it. I&#x27;d like to see a language where the language-level data structures are explicitly viewed through the lens of \"how I serialize these into memory\", rather than the data structure implicitly creating such a specification by how it is defined, so for instance you could swap out a SoA to an AoS by swapping only the way the compiler serializes to RAM and not any of the rest of the code. Obviously you provide defaults that look like modern languages, but with this you could directly implement things like tagged unions with custom bit layouts, or theoretically, directly accessing gzip&#x27;d data by specifying that this data structure can only be accessed sequentially but as long as that&#x27;s what you do you don&#x27;t need to directly unzip it, etc. This doesn&#x27;t directly answer \"how do you utilize modern hardware correctly\" but gives you tools to potentially create a better match than what compilers give by default.Again, to be clear, this is crazy pie-in-the-sky far out ideas that I do not have an implementation in mind for, but it&#x27;s the sort of thing I&#x27;d like to see more experimentation with on the fringes of language dev. (And I only wish I had time to do it myself. Unfortunately, I simply do not.)(And, as the sibling comments point out, yeah, assembler technically, but that&#x27;s kind of a cop out.) reply hawk_ 19 hours agorootparent> To some extent, just sitting down for a year to learn modern assembler and starting from the very, very bottom once again to build a high level language, rather than starting with C and building \"C, but ...\"Right so build a &#x27;union&#x27; of what&#x27;s available and somehow try to fit it in a unified model.

There&#x27;s not a lot of totally new ideas.But there was a lot of things tried in the 1960s and 1970s whose only fault was that they were simply too early. For example, people were researching neural nets back then. They basically got nowhere. In hindsight, they never could have, simply because it was too soon and the requisite power wasn&#x27;t there yet.A phone is more heterogenous today than I think even supercomputers were in the 1990s, and the trend is only increasing diversity, with neural processors on the near horizon and quantum on the far horizon (as it seems quantum processors are far more likely to end up functioning as a sort of fancy \"accelerator card\" than their own CPUs). & honestly even CPUs are almost viewable as their C subset and their vector processing subset, and even \"within\" the same CPU the two don&#x27;t always cross particularly gracefully. reply schwoll 19 hours agorootparentprevKeep in mind C is just basically assembly but encapsulated in a pretty package. If you create small executables and dump out the generated unoptimized assembly you&#x27;ll be surprised just how simple it is. It pretty much just encapsulates the ideas of System V binary compatibility and then keeps going. So developing a language from scratch and skipping the use of C would really likely be just causing yourself more pain than you need as you&#x27;re going to have to replicate all of the things C does anyways, so why not reuse what the experts have already done. And you get a lot of cross CPU and cross compiler portability.What you want is the idea of bootstrapping. Write your compiler in C, then as your language specification is developed enough, dogfood your own compiler. Write your compiler in your new language, then compile itself. This is called bootstrapping and is how many languages are developed.

Under this definition, C is absolutely a high-level language.My complaint would not exactly be that the author is playing semantic games; it would be that they are clinging to archaic terminology in a way that does more to confuse than enlighten. The \"generations\" taxonomy is generally more descriptive. 1st: Machine 2nd: Assembly 3rd: General-purpose 4th: Application-specificThe 3rd&#x2F;4th distinction gets a bit muddied sometimes, and back in the 80s and 90s people talked about a 5th generation that never really took off. But a couple (I think) clear examples of 4GLs are SQL, HyperCard, and Mathematica.What I like about that approach is that it mostly breaks languages up according to fairly clear distinctions about when you would use them. And then we can use \"high&#x2F;low-level\" as a relative term, where higher-level languages tend to do more to abstract away the details of what the computer is actually doing. That does mean that higher-generation languages tend to be higher-level; all we lose in doing it that way is the ability to have silly arguments about where to place a completely arbitrary (and, frankly, useless) dividing line.I also like that this way we can recognize .NET IL, WebAssembly, and Java bytecode as very high-level 2nd generation languages, which, at the very least, is fun.Oh, and Forth is a 3rd generation language.

This is why we have truckload of side-channel attacks in X86 to begin with. To \"emulate\" PDP-11s faster and faster. reply Joker_vD 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not even that faithful to PDP-11, either. PDP-11 has unified integer division&#x2F;modulo instruction (and it operates in double-width: it takes 32-bit dividend and 16-bit divisor and produces 16-bit quotient and remainder, just like x86), it has double-width integer multiplication (again, just like x86), it has instruction for addition&#x2F;subtraction with carry — nothing of that is available from (standard) C, and it&#x27;s quite a pity. And also, while PDP-12 it has built-in support for post-increment and pre-decrement for pointers, it doesn&#x27;t has built-in pre-increment or post-decrement. reply AnimalMuppet 20 hours agorootparentprevI think we&#x27;d have the side-channel attacks on x86 even if we wrote in assembler - unless we wrote the assembler specifically with an eye to preventing (the known kinds of) side-channel attacks.Put differently, I don&#x27;t think the side-channel attacks would disappear if we wrote in Rust or Haskell or Agda. reply bayindirh 19 hours agorootparentThe side channel attacks are not a result of programming in C, but the design of the hardware which doesn&#x27;t upset the view of the system w.r.t. C compilers.All programming languages, regardless of their type (imperative, functional) or interfacing method with the system (JIT, interpreted, compiled) are not immune from these attacks, because it&#x27;s the hardware which is designed to emulate PDP-11.In other words, all programming languages target a modern PDP-11 at the end of the day. If hardware has shown all of its tricks (esp. cache management, invalidation, explicit prefetching, etc.), and lacked speculative, out of order execution, these problems will go away, but getting the highest performance would become much harder and complicated, and even impossible in some cases.Intel tried this with IA64, with a \"No tricks, compiler shall optimize\" approach, and it tanked to put it mildly (esp. after AMD64 came out). reply AnimalMuppet 18 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s say we have two chips. Chip A requires the programmer to handle all the \"magic\" stuff. Chip B is like current chips; it hides that stuff. Chip B is subject to side channel attacks. Chip A likely is also unless the programmer is very careful.Which chip would have sold more? I assert that chip B would have, by a massive volume, because it didn&#x27;t require the programmer to mess with all that stuff.So I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s fair to say that the chip is trying to look like a PDP-11 because of C. I think it&#x27;s trying to look like a simpler chip, so that mere mortals can program it and still get most of the maximum performance. reply Yoric 12 hours agorootparentprevI believe that the point is the processor was designed to please C (by emulating PDP-11). And this design complicates things immensely, which is how we end up with side-channel attacks on our processors. reply rfoo 21 hours agorootparentprevThe post argues that there is no portable low-level languages, including C.i.e. truly low-level languages can&#x27;t be portable and is bound to the architecture. reply scythe 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s plausible that a language could expose some general logic behind instruction-level parallelism and cache management — even register renaming — without being explicitly tied to the way one particular architecture does that. I have no idea how to design such a language, but from 10000 meters I think it could be done.I think the author oversteps his case by suggesting that ILP is an abomination that exists to preserve the availability of C-like languages. In my experience, many algorithms seem to naturally lend themselves to ILP, and I often find myself wondering whether I have typed them in so that these five lines will in fact run simultaneously. One common flaw in critiques of the common C compiler model is that they all seem afflicted by a nostalgia for Lisp machines, when the space of unexplored possibilities is so much larger. reply scythe 20 hours agorootparentprev>if C is not a portable low-level language, what on earth is?This question doesn&#x27;t have to have an answer. The author of TFA apparently believes that a low-level language is one that effectively and clearly exposes the execution model of the hardware to the programmer. Under this definition, no widespread language (except assembly) is truly low-level, and possibly none are.Which, for what it&#x27;s worth, is also what I was taught in school. C was consistently described as a high-level language by my professors, even if it is \"lower-level\" than almost everything else. reply gpderetta 19 hours agorootparentThe real question is whether you would even want to use a language that effectively and clearly exposes the execution model of the hardware. Not even most assemblers do that as architectures give stronger guarantees that would be implied by the microarch execution model.Some machines do expose the microarchitecture (or better, there is no architecture other that what is implemented in hardware by a specific revision) and rely on install-time or even JIT code specialization. But especially on this machines it would be insane to try to manually target them as you would have to rewrite your code for every revision.So, targeting the effective execution model of the machine is out of question. You need an abstraction. The question is whether C is the correct abstraction. reply pjmlp 21 hours agoparentprevOnly when taking into account language extensions that are compiler specific and not part of ISO C.Also a reminder that any language can have toolchains with extensions exposing low level features. reply hcks 21 hours agoparentprevFunny how the top comment on \"hacker\" news is an *unsubstantial* comment about how, actually, TFA is wrong.Even worse, adding a comment on how actually you shouldn’t be curious and understand how things really work. reply titzer 17 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s a lot of moaning and crowing here, but no real substance. If one were to design a CPU and its ISA from scratch, what would you do? Instructions, control flow, memory, out-of-order execution, caches, hierarchies, branch prediction, you&#x27;d probably end up with all of it down there anyway. I don&#x27;t get the point about GPUs. Real applications aren&#x27;t matrix multiplies and embarrassingly parallel numeric algorithms, they run general purpose PLs.Which basically then boils down to ISA design. If you could design an ISA from scratch for the hardware you design from scratch, what would you do? Well, there aren&#x27;t that many options. Stack machine, dataflow machine, VLIW machine. All of those have been tried and the modern superscalar CPUs kick their butts on every metric except power.The whole article kind of misses the point anyway. We should probably be running higher level languages for most things anyway, which shouldn&#x27;t be overly constrained by hardware design. For everything else, 100% serious, there is WebAssembly, and hardware ISAs will fade below this level of abstraction in the fullness of time. reply spion 20 hours agoparentprevCan you elaborate? reply ndiddy 19 hours agoprevI disagree with the author&#x27;s point that CPU instruction sets should expose more of the CPU&#x27;s implementation. This has been tried in the past and failed to work long-term. One example of this is branch delay slots from some RISC processors (such as MIPS and SuperH) designed in the late 80s and early 90s. For those unfamiliar with the concept, it basically means that the instruction after a branch instruction will get run regardless of if the branch was taken or not. This was a short-term benefit, as it meant the job of avoiding pipeline stalls after a branch was left to the programmer, so the processor could be simpler and cheaper than designs without them. However, as time went on, the processor designs evolved with more complex pipelines, so the single instruction wasn&#x27;t enough to cover the branch delay. Instead, it became a legacy issue that future processors had to deal with for compatibility reasons and made their branch prediction and pipeline logic more complex. reply danielmarkbruce 19 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s saying \"expose random implementation details\".

Among the strawmen we find:* arguing that speculative execution \"were added to let C programmers continue to believe they were programming in a low-level language\".* claiming that \"modern processors are trying to emulate \"the same abstract machine as a PDP-11\"* \"Creating a new thread is a library operation known to be expensive, so processors wishing to keep their execution units busy running C code rely on ILP (instruction-level parallelism).\"* etc etc etc.I don&#x27;t think this opinion piece is grounded on reality, let alone is an objective take. reply danielmarkbruce 18 hours agorootparentHe doesn&#x27;t define a model. He just discusses the gap between c&#x27;s model and a few details of a modern CPU and talks about a few other models.In your opinion, why was speculative execution added? It doesn&#x27;t seem off base to suggest it was to enable programmers to continue writing single threaded applications while increasing execution speed.In your opinion, what is wrong with the statement that modern processors are trying to emulate an abstract machine like PDP-11? To me it seems largely right. reply bayindirh 19 hours agoparentprevCounterpoint: Allowing explicit control over prefetching or providing an additional \"engine\" which brings in data to caches in a pattern you like is esp. beneficial in real-time and latency sensitive applications.I have listened a talk where developers used such subsystem in the given processor. If unused, they would spend 95% of their time window just to copy the data, however by requesting the data ahead of time via that engine, they only used 10% of their time window to get the data, and accomplished what they wanted in ~50% of the time window they have, leaving tons of time for further features and improvements.If x86 had a such feature, I&#x27;d use that in my Ph.D. to request the matrix data I&#x27;m accessing ahead of time, because the pattern I use is not linear but well defined.

Paper arXiv Code 4D-GS can learn a dynamic scene within 20 minutes and reach the rendering speed over 50 fps of the view on one RTX 3080 GPU. Abstract Representing and rendering dynamic scenes has been an important but challenging task. Especially, to accurately model complex motions, high efficiency is usually hard to maintain. We introduce the 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) to achieve real-time dynamic scene rendering while also enjoying high training and storage efficiency. An efficient deformation field is constructed to model both Gaussian motions and shape deformations. Different adjacent Gaussians are connected via a HexPlane to produce more accurate position and shape deformations. Our 4D-GS method achieves real-time rendering under high resolutions, 70 FPS at a 800*800 resolution on an RTX 3090 GPU, while maintaining comparable or higher quality than previous state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves real-time rendering for dynamic scenes at high image resolutions while maintaining high rendering quality. The right figure is mainly tested on synthetic datasets, where the radius of the dot corresponds to the training time. \"Res\": resolution. The overall pipeline of our model. Given a group of 3D Gaussians S, we extract the center of each 3D Gaussian X and timestamp t to compute the voxel feature by multi-resolution voxel planes. Then a tiny MLP is used to decode the feature and get S` of each Gaussian at timestamp t.

Gaussian Splatting has been around since at least the early 90s. There&#x27;s even a few old games made with the technique.The paper I think your referring to made the interesting leap that a 3d radiance field could be rerendered out as a field of Gaussian splats, and that this would probably run faster in modern GPU pipelines for real-time performance. It looks like they also have the nice property of being able to be shifted around in memory quickly hence the animation property seen here. reply blovescoffee 10 hours agorootparentIf you want to be pedantic, the paper made the leap it did because of differentiable rendering which necessarily needs a differentiable representation of primitives - so they use Gaussians. It’s entirely novel and set in a nascent field (neural rendering). Gaussians happen to be further representable as easily rasterized primitives. Though some considerable work was put into making this performant. Everyone who keeps saying this has been around since the 90s is missing the context of the very modern differentiable rendering literature. reply verytrivial 1 hour agorootparentprevI remember a 4k demo that used translucent triangles (I think? my brain is showing me circles, so perhaps a fixed set of sizes and fast blit with alpha.)

But, the idea of splatting points, Gaussians, ellipsoids and a variety of other shapes has been around for at least 20 years.The novelty of the paper was in using the differentiability of Gaussians to enable fitting splats to incrementally match all of the target photos simultaneously. So, it’s a new way to generate the splats from photos rather than modeling them by hand. reply scheeseman486 1 hour agorootparentPlayStation Dreams used a very similar technique. replykrasin 11 hours agorootparentprevInteresting! Can you please name some of these old games made with Gaussian Splatting? I would be interested to play, to get a sense why polygons won in that round (and likely to lose in this one). reply chaboud 6 hours agorootparentI used additive gaussian fields (restricted by bounding regions) for this back in the late 90&#x27;s for audio visualizations in a ripper&#x2F;player called \"Siren\" (back when we actually thought we could charge money for something like that).The technique worked well on non-accelerated (CPU only) hardware of the era, with the additive approach saving the pain of needing to keep a z buffer or fragment list.Gaussian voxel reconstruction is useful in medical and GIS settings, which, if memory serves, is where Kyle Freeman from Novalogic drew on for his work on Comanche. As far as I know, that was the first commercial game with voxel rendering... It&#x27;s been a bit since I played it, but the swimming jaggies make me think that it was Manhattan distance height map offset by planar traversal (kinda like Doom raycasting) or some similar trick. I don&#x27;t recall any intersections or overhangs, but, to be fair, I was a middle schooler when Comanche came out.It also ran fine on my weak sauce PC.Once acceleration hit, transformation of triangles with fixed-function pipelines took over. The ability to push textured triangles with minimal per-pixel value adjustment took over. Slowly but surely we&#x27;ve swing back to high ALU balance (albeit via massive stream parallelism). We&#x27;ve shifted from heavy list&#x2F;vertex transformers to giant array multiply&#x2F;add processors.It&#x27;s a pretty great time to be a processing nerd. reply otteromkram 11 hours agorootparentprevFrom another user:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dnOXk3QJWN8 reply kelseyfrog 10 hours agorootparentprevThe point of Gaussian Splatting for me is that it is a learned representation.

They&#x27;re really interesting thing is that they&#x27;re being used here to render the learned representation, but there&#x27;s nothing particularly special about them or new or AI&#x2F;ML about them.You could \"model\" 3d objects with the gaussians by just putting a bunch together. It was a way to produce fast rendering 3d images without using a bunch of polygons. The results back then were...left behind by other techniques.There&#x27;s a massive back catalog of computer graphics work on the technique, it&#x27;s usually just easiest to use the search tools and search back for all dates leading up to say...2021 and you&#x27;ll find tons of normal old stuff like CS 302 - Computer Graphics courseware slides or whatever on the technique.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=gaussian+splat+-site%3Apinte... reply ezconnect 8 hours agorootparentBeing old and seeing the new generations amazed by the reapplication of what was discovered and used decades ago in a novel way amazes me. reply atonalfreerider 10 hours agoparentprevThis one was released today as well.

Either fill in details by cloning a gaussian in an area which is undercovered, or split a gaussian in an area which is overcovered.They use the gradient of the view-space position to determine if more detail is needed, ie those gaussians which the optimizer wants to move significantly over the screen seems to be in a region with not enough detail.They then use the covariance of the gaussians to determine to split or to clone. Gaussians with large variance get split, the others cloned.They also remove gaussians which are almost entirely transparent, no point in keeping those around.That&#x27;s my understanding at least, after a first time gloss-through. reply webdood90 10 hours agorootparentYou:> Essentially they&#x27;re doing what you do when you train a neural network, only that instead of adjusting weights connecting \"neurons\", you adjust the shape and position of gaussians, and the coefficients of spherical harmonics for the colors.My brain:> They&#x27;re providing inverse reactive current to generate unilateral phase detractors, automatically synchronizing cardinal gram meters. reply magicalhippo 9 hours agorootparentHeh. For those that haven&#x27;t dabbled much with neural nets, the key aspect here is the backpropagation[1].

If it changed too much you reduce the parameter etc. This is a forwards process.The idea in backpropogation is instead to mathematically relate a change in output to a change in the parameters. You figure out how much you need to change the parameters to change the output a desired amount. Hence the \"back\" in the name, since you want to control the output, \"steering\" it in the direction you want, and to do so you go backwards through the process to figure out how much you need to change the parameters.Instead of \"if I turn the knob 15 degrees the temperature goes up 20 degrees\", you want \"in order to increase the temperature 20 degrees the knob must be turned 15 degrees\".By comparing the output with a reference, you get how much the output needs to change to match the reference, and by using the backpropagation technique you can then relate that to how much you need to change the parameters.In neural nets the parameters are the so-called weights of the connections between the layers in the model. However the idea is quite general so here they&#x27;ve applied it to optimizing the size, shape, position and color of (gaussian) blobs, which when rendered on top of each other blend to form an image.Changing a blobs position say might make it better for one pixel but worse for another. So instead of doing a big change in parameters, you do small iterative steps. This is the so-called training phase. Over time the hope is that the output error decreases steadily.edit: while backpropagation is quite general as such, as I alluded to earlier, it does require that the operation behaves sufficiently nice, so to speak. That&#x27;s one reason for using gaussians over say spheres. Gaussians have nice smooth properties. Spheres have an edge, the surface, which introduces a sudden change. Backpropagation works best with smooth changes.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Backpropagation reply flakes 5 hours agorootparentThank you. This was much more approachable for someone like myself that has little background (a few undergrad courses) in both machine learning and computer vision concepts. reply ewngzen 7 hours agorootparentprevI was just about to ask why not use a sphere? since it could be thought of as a nn, it will be into NN someday. guess the splitting and merge can be compared with dropout then. reply magicalhippo 2 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m no expert, but my immediate thoughts are that evaluating a gaussian blob is very simple, it&#x27;s just an exponential of a distance. The edge of a sphere makes it more complicated to compute, hence slower.For backpropagation, the differentials of a gaussian is smooth while it&#x27;s not for a sphere, again because of the edge.Now, if you want to use a sphere you probably will do something like using an opacity falloff similar to ReLU[1], making it transparent at the edge.This should make smooth enough as such I guess, but I imagine you still have the more complicated rendering. Though I may be mistaken.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rectifier_(neural_networks) reply pests 10 hours agorootparentprevI still continue to read comments like those though - there is a chance I might make sense of a word!

I occasionally run into people with very strong and vapid opinions about entire countries based on 1-2 anecdotal experiences. I haven&#x27;t seen this issue with other fields.

Is there a grain of truth to the “lazy Indian” trope?Indian here. First generation, naturalized American, et cetera. I&#x27;ll be honest and say that my initial response was, “Ugh! Your friend is a big old racist”.Moving on from that reflexive thought, I&#x27;ll attempt to answer your question of:> I’m asking is there a perceptual issue due to some factor that’s obvious to the typical Nth-generation American?Well, perhaps. There are a bunch of factors:- The H1B program is terrible in that it ties your immigration status to your current employer. Couple this with the “you can be legally fired because your boss doesn&#x27;t like the color of your shoes” climate in the US and you have a pretty stressed-out bunch of people. - A lot of consulting companies seem to pay just enough wages that attract Indian H1B employees of a average to low caliber of talent, and hire them out for random software projects. The Americans on the other side of those contractors get mad at the contractors, who happen to be all Indian. - There is a genuine cultural gap where Indians are more deferential to someone they perceive as having higher authority. It is sometimes possible that a young Indian employee might call you “Sir”, because that was how they addressed superiors.So...all these are perceptual issues of the sort you are looking at. But honestly, these sorts of cultural misunderstandings are not exactly uncommon among Europeans and Americans as well. Big Tech tends to have far fewer of the issues above. Salaries are high (I don&#x27;t even work in Big Tech and my salary as an H1B was verifiably higher than some of my American coworkers), and IMO there isn&#x27;t a huge difference between Indians and the N other cultures that make up the boiling pot of tech.But then that brings me to the part about “friend who works big tech and he has no chill for Indians”. Like, Indians period? What does he think about Sanjay Ghemawat? What about Vinod Khosla? How about Amit Patel, who came up with Google&#x27;s “Don&#x27;t Be Evil”? What about the engineers&#x2F;PMs&#x2F;etc. in big tech to whom those issues don&#x27;t apply?All of this leads me to conclude (this time after some reflection) that your friend is actually just a...big old racist if he has a problem with all Indians in general, especially those working in Big Tech.Take from that what you will. Hope you find better friends :) reply klibertp 42 minutes agorootparent> It is sometimes possible that a young Indian employee might call you “Sir”There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that - it&#x27;s awkward the first 3 times, a non-issue ever after.My problem is with the use of flowery, deferential language to mask misunderstandings. My sample count is 3, so I&#x27;m not going to say anything about a 1bln+ nation (I somehow don&#x27;t want to self-identify as the GP&#x27;s friend) - I&#x27;m just noting it happened more often with those 3 guys. I have no idea, even, in what part, if any, it was intentional, so - again - just noting it happened.What&#x27;s interesting is that it somehow went away after ~1&#x2F;2 to 1 years. My guess is that it takes people a while to internalize drastic changes in assumptions they make.

But if someone has problems with the language, doesn&#x27;t get the jokes, and&#x2F;or has a vastly different timezone, you&#x27;ll remember them as distinctly \"Indian\".That means if someone asks you to remember experiences with Indian coworkers, you might be more likely to recall the people that didn&#x27;t work out well, because they stood out more strongly. reply busterarm 3 hours agorootparentprevI used to loudly proclaim, given previous work experience, that companies that offshore basic internal services like HR and Desktop Support across the world are companies in their bad times & willing to abuse their own employees.Then my own employer did exactly that after a rough few years and layoff rounds.

They also do stuff that needs to be taken care of. All kinds of unusal things happen and not all are suitable for delegation. 17 direct reports is not only a measure of how many colleagues they need to manage. It is also a measure of the large the weird-things-that-needs-taking-of-scope is. reply myself248 4 hours agorootparentSeriously. The most effective teams I&#x27;ve ever worked in, had 3-5 people under a manager. The manager occasionally got their hands dirty when they could spare the time, but in general, \"getting every roadblock out of 5 people&#x27;s way\" is a lot of work, and combined with all the non-delegatable stuff, would keep them pretty busy.When a team grows much beyond that, the manager is no longer removing all the roadblocks. They&#x27;re doing all that other stuff that _can&#x27;t_ be delegated, and the team under them is now spending time doing stuff that _technically can be delegated_ but would be much more efficient for the manager to do.Typically what happens then, is one of the underlings becomes the de-facto also-manager, relieving the burden from the rest of the team and increasing overall productivity by re-centralizing certain duties. However, this hurts their individual productivity metrics, so in bean-counter companies this is a hazardous move. It&#x27;s safer to not help the team and just let the sick structure shamble on. reply nostrademons 2 hours agorootparentWas thinking about this in mathematical terms recently, in terms of what&#x27;s efficient vs. what can scale. In general, managers can&#x27;t do things for reports that don&#x27;t scale fairly across their whole team, because otherwise it&#x27;ll give the appearance of favoritism for those reports who get favors and demotivate the rest. So to a first approximation, a manager with N reports can devote at most 1&#x2F;N of their time to making a report&#x27;s job easier. (To a second approximation, it&#x27;s more like 1&#x2F;2N because the manager also has overhead tasks like 1:1s and performance reviews that scale with the number of reports. To a third approximation the denominator scales supra-linearly after about 10 reports because you start taking up all your time with management tasks and have literally zero time for project work.)Their goal is to keep their report&#x27;s time fully utilized, so it is logical for a manager to take on a task if it saves their report 2N as much time in IC work. For example, a manager with 4 reports can devote up to 10 hours&#x2F;week fairly to each one; taking the second approximation, that&#x27;s 5 hours of overhead and 5 hours of project work. The report has 40 hours&#x2F;week of time. Therefore, it makes sense for the manager to do a one-hour task (say, design work) if it saves the report at least 8 hours of work. A manager with 10 reports can devote only 4 hours&#x2F;week to each, so with 2 hours of overhead and 2 hours of project work, it makes sense to take on a one-hour task only if it saves the report 20 hours of work. Taking the third approximation and assuming overhead is a constant 2 hours&#x2F;week&#x2F;report, the first case becomes 8 hours of project work, and so a task makes sense if it saves the report 5 hours of work.You can see how a manager very rapidly approaches the \"Do nothing other than bare minimum performance reviews, 1:1s, and save the report from blatant stupidity\" line as their reporting load increases. This is why so much moderate stupidity and waste persists in big companies: the manager is not incentivized to remove it (and doesn&#x27;t have time to anyway), but the report does not have the organizational power to change it. And ironically flatter hierarchies tend to be worse at this, unless they have ICs step up and do the \"improve efficiency for everyone\" role, but then they&#x27;re usually either promoted into management or they leave.This is also why managers look chronically dumb and entitled to ICs. The IC can see plenty of opportunities where \"If you just did X, which takes 15 minutes of your time, it would save me 2 hours of my time.\" They don&#x27;t realize that their manager has 10 other reports, so a.) their manager does not have 15 minutes of time to spare and b.) their manager is only going to spend it if saves at least a day. Otherwise it makes more sense for the employee to do it themselves, simply from a scalability perspective. reply baby 4 hours agorootparentprevIf the managers are also individual contributors then that makes sense reply monkeydreams 4 hours agorootparentprevI have 10 direct reports across 2 teams, with responsibility for a number of actual deliverable work pieces external to these staff.10 direct reports is about half a week&#x27;s work at a bare minimum without development, process improvement, etc. 20 is insane and would lead to skill atrophy and team dissatisfaction in short order. reply baby 4 hours agorootparentWhy does managing the team takes so much work? Do you need to hold the hand of all your reports? reply monkeydreams 3 hours agorootparentMy team have a very wide and complex domain of work; essentially we cover all of the domain of public health administration - patient management through to billing through to regulatory reporting, etc, etc. My team can be presenting formal advice for changes to statutory inpatient reporting one day, then troubleshooting a billing algorithm the next day, and then writing a FHIR parser the day after.In light of this I budget the following time for each of them:1 hour a fortnight for general chat (what I refer to as temperature taking) to see where each of them are at in terms of morale, etc.1&#x2F;2 hour a fortnight for 1:1 catch-up covering administrative requirements (leave, review of metrics, etc, etc).1 hour a fortnight (1&#x2F;2 per week) for metric collection and review; are they having trouble with specific elements of their domain, are certain managers, stakeholders, customers, etc, holding things up. Their work tickets vary wildly in complexity and scope so this is the absolute minimum I can spend to know where each person is up to professionally speaking.1 hour a fortnight for mentoring, training, etc. Generally speaking the more skilled staff will contact me more often to \"pick my brain\" regarding how to approach certain technical&#x2F;personnal challenges, how to link data across our datasets, who to contact for advice on this or that regulatory or statutory requirement.And about half an hour per person, per fortnight reviewing their changes or service requests as I am primary CAB representative for my products - and these items are key outputs of the work they deliver.So, in essence, four hours per team member per fortnight. Very little hand-holding for such a widely dispersed team, and they remain engaged and focused on their tasks with minimum disruption. reply nrawe 1 hour agorootparentprevManaging people properly takes time.For example, a 30 min 1:1 with the report looking at their wellbeing, motivation, challenges, career goals should be a weekly task. The 30 mins is really 45 mins because notes need to be made following so that there is audit trail, and clarity of expectations for both parties.

This is from working at some top companies reply ditonal 7 hours agoparentSilicon Valley used to have engineering managers who managed engineering.As the money got bigger we got more grifters &#x2F; professional manager types. First thing they do is rebrand middle management as “leaders” and the other thing they do is make management non technical.This has even bled into making higher level IC engineering roles being “above” coding. “Staff engineers don’t code, they set high level architecture “.This is toxic to an engineering org in many ways. Firstly you now have a bunch of highly paid technical employees completely removed from how things actually work. But what’s worse is you created a culture where you’re incentived to follow - a senior engineer who wants to get promoted should write less code because coding is associated with being a low level employee.The fundamental root cause is a misunderstanding of code as low level factory work and not intrinsically tied to the design and architecture. But it’s one of many ways in which traditional business structures and software engineering do not mesh and you need an extremely strong engineering leader to keep software culture on track, which very few organizations have. reply charles_f 6 hours agorootparent> As the money got bigger we got more grifters &#x2F; professional manager types.That.

Of my professional life so far. He would dictate the technical solution and shut down every initiative, making people below him mere executioners. No room for dissent, he had the last word on everything.The problem being, this person worked for like ~5 years as a developer, then became a manager, then got in charge of infrastructure.And oh boy, infrastructure was not his core competency.So prod infrastructure was essentially at a hobbyist level (everything in the same subnet, some dev stuff along with prod stuff, no network segmentation, a number of things implicitly relied on virtual machines not being rebooted or getting the same ipv4 if rebooted, dns was a patchwork etc). In all this he avoided solutions that he wouldn’t understand (no matter if people below him would understand them). Oh and he would have the console access to cloud services and the authority to do all the testing he wanted, we did not (hence perpetuating some thoroughly artificial knowledge gap).So yeah… having a technical manager can be awful. reply iamthemonster 5 hours agorootparentprevWow.

I feel there is no clear answer possible. We are trying to objectively analyse what is not objective in the first place. Before we discuss necessity of some role we need to define it. Who is a good technical manager? What do they bring to the table? Definitions anyone? I can try but it will be subjective. I am sure there are different sets of opinions around what %mentoring and IC they should do. In fact, can we even define software engineering role and standards? Someone who writes code to solve a problem? To me a good one will write concise code thats easy to change making good use of available tools and paradigms. I have already used several vague terms. My point being, we are in a profession where entry barriers are low. Role responsibilities and standard of good work are contextual and opinionated. That has a direct impact on your experience with peers and managers. You are not always going to approve of the number of managers, their level of tech involvement etc. Have clarity on what you can tolerate and what you cannot compromise on. reply jillesvangurp 1 hour agoparentYou can actually use the SOLID heuristics that people use to evaluate code quality to also look at organizational quality and the quality of decision making in organizations.Larger amounts of managers means more levels of indirection and more opportunity for miscommunication, conflicts of interest, and other negative patterns. The way to fix a broken software organization is similar to how you would refactor a faulty code base. You start by looking at the most complicated bits and refactor those to be simpler and easier to understand. You might also profile things a bit: where are things getting stuck in the organization. And so on.Either way, the fixes tend to be similar as well: remove unnecessary levels of indirection (layers of management). Look for places with lots of dependencies. Look for ways to increase cohesiveness and reduce coupling. Etc. How do you improve cohesiveness and reduce coupling? Break teams up. Have less managers. Reduce their interfaces to each other. Shorten the lines of communication. If you know your SOLID principles, that should sound familiar.Large organizations do the same as bloated code bases: when in doubt, they add people (more code) to fix issues. So, you get a lot of functional duplication because this part of the organization is just in the wrong part of the org tree to be off use to that part. So, they hire their own people to do the same. And some more managers to manage those, which then fractally make things worse. And you get this culture of fracturing responsibilities across large amounts of teams and those teams having to work around each other.That&#x27;s how Google ended up with a few dozen different chat clients.

Of course doing the sensible thing here (talk directly) pisses off everybody along that path who justify their existence by gatekeeping their precious resources (i.e. people) and jealously control flows of information.I&#x27;ve been there and done that and have had to deal with such executives. Not fun to have your boss tell you that his boss got yelled at by their bosses because you had the nerve to send an email to a report of their report&#x27;s report. This is a thing that happened to me. I was actually encouraged to continue to engage with \"the other side\" (as it was obviously the right thing to do) but please keep them (all of them) in the loop because it made them look like the bunch of useless muppets they were. In their defense, this was a tense time for them because there was this thing called the iphone that was an existential threat to the entire organization and people were very busy identifying the most dysfunctional bits in the org tree for firing as things were going rather poorly. I got caught up in one of the larger rounds eventually. reply expertentipp 1 hour agorootparentGot somehow similar experience, except software folks tended to mingle quite a lot and cooperate. But pushing through anything new or getting help... The hierarchies were brutal, the management were yuppies busy with business travel and \"conferences\".

The higher the growth, the more managers at a more inefficient manager&#x2F;report ratio generally.Certain orgs in LinkedIn were growing really fast.

But, now I see that is the result of faulty processes, promoting too early and for all the wrong reasons.In my second job, my manager was my strength. We didn&#x27;t have much meetings, rather lots of one-on-ones or 3-4 people discussing. Most of us were just out of college. So, when we had strong opinions on the product features, they not only heard us, but helped formulate a proper argument that we could present. He was also a good mentor, helping me reframe my viewpoint, when I didn&#x27;t agree with one of my very senior colleagues (Later turned out the senior colleague was right. In retrospect, I really pity that colleague for he had to work with a big bunch of naive college graduates with no coding discipline :) )It helps that the whole environment in the company was one of openness, camaraderie and a real desire to make a difference. But a good manager can always make a great difference in your work and happiness. reply jamestimmins 8 hours agoparentReally appreciate this perspective.Unfortunately a lot of folks get promoted into management w&#x2F;out skills&#x2F;training, so engineers think all managers are bad.

Add on some recruiting&#x2F;hiring meetings, ad hoc \"let&#x27;s get in a room and talk about it\" risk discussions, random all hands, and some bursty higher level stuff (OKRs&#x2F;goal setting&#x2F;etc).That&#x27;s >20h a week, and I do feel like people need all of those to be productive. If I cut the 1:1s, attrition rises. If I cut the status meetings, stuff gets off track and fingers start being pointed. I&#x27;m pretty aggressive when it comes to cancelling 1:1 or status meetings. We&#x27;ll do a lot of \"we don&#x27;t need this cross team sync meeting unless someone has something they want to talk about or ask questions on\". Any time I spend on people or making sure we know what we&#x27;re trying to accomplish has huge ROI, IMO.FWIW: Was a former lead developer with decade plus experience hands on coding, so I believe I can bring at least some developer perspective. I have a CS degree, not a management one. reply kenjackson 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s pretty standard.

The stream would have to be rendered on the spot and not in advance, which puts further pressure on compute resources during peak times. That would decrease margins, maybe so much it isn&#x27;t feasible at all. reply shiroiuma 4 hours agorootparent(Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t know that much about video codecs or editing.) I&#x27;m surprised they don&#x27;t just break the video at key frames and insert the ads that way. From my little use of open-source video editing tools, it seems like this is pretty low-CPU to do, and if (like YouTube) you don&#x27;t care about a good user experience and are happy to just insert ads at seemingly-random places instead of between natural breaks in the program (as with TV shows), it should work. reply danpalmer 2 minutes agorootparent> and if (like YouTube) you don&#x27;t care about a good user experienceOther than ads, which is the business model and keeps the content flowing... does YouTube not care about UX? I generally find the UX pretty good. I can always watch a video near-instantly, on nearly every device I own, search is astonishingly good even when my Apple TV mis-hears my searches, and it&#x27;s one of the biggest video streaming sites in the world.As a user I think the UX overall is pretty great. Sure there are things I&#x27;d tweak, but I can see reasons for them. reply ggeorgovassilis 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are probably right, eg Losslesscut in Linux does exactly that: no transcoding, no overlays nor any editing other than cutting and moving around sequences from the same video. Editing and exporting such videos is blazingly fast.Adding a bit technical context (for readers) to your comment on inserting ads at \"random places\": many codecs use the concept of an initial frame [1] which would place technical restrictions on where the ad could be inserted. If Youtube believes that ad timing is too important, they might not accept technical restrictions on the timing.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Video_compression_picture_type... reply yurishimo 9 minutes agorootparentCreators can mark specific sections in the video where they want an ad to play. I assume this dynamism also plays a contributing role. reply Almondsetat 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can chain MP4 containers without re-rendering anything. It&#x27;s extremely quick and computationally inexpensive. Of course at such a scale it might still cost a lot in the absolute sense, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it would be balanced by the increased revenue reply ggeorgovassilis 2 hours agorootparentI understand Youtube uses a variety of codecs and encoding parameters to serve videos to a multitude of platforms and clients. Maybe there are restrictions on some clients that force Youtube to pick a codec for them which makes ad embedding unprofitable. Circumventing embedded videos would then be as trivial as faking a particular client signature. reply endisneigh 13 hours agoparentprevThe end game isn’t embedded stream, it’s attestation reply __MatrixMan__ 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve heard things along these lines, but always as an aside. Can you expand on this?Like, YouTube would only work in a browser environment which has been approved by Google? and which has promised not to be running in headless mode?

This completely eliminates the issue of both adblockers and third-party frontends. reply oxygen_crisis 9 hours agorootparentAfter that, impression tracking just needs to start covering some of that gap of air between your brain and the screen.

When I click on the video, I only want the actual content. Ad segments aren&#x27;t the only way to monetize anyway.> Basically you want people creating videos for free?Noone \"wants\" anything here. It&#x27;s just more convenient. reply kzshantonu 3 hours agorootparentprevSponsorblock doesn&#x27;t take away sponsorship money from creators. Sponsors have no way of knowing how many people use sponsorblock. Oh I also pay for premium. So the creators get their cake and I eat ad-free content. Win win reply shiroiuma 7 hours agorootparentprevMe watching a sponsor segment isn&#x27;t going to make any money for the video creator. They&#x27;re being paid by the sponsor to place the segment in their video; there&#x27;s no way for the sponsor to track who watches it. The segment is just a waste of my time.This is separate from YouTube itself tracking who watches the video, and for how long (and if they skip any), and if they watch any ads, and then giving a bit of money to the creator for the ad views. reply hnick 7 hours agorootparentIs this true? I&#x27;m not sure if sponsors ask for this but I think metrics are available to creators to show how many people watch during different portions of the video, so they could, including post-payment based on the results.See audienceWatchRatio under https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;analytics&#x2F;metricsExample: \"A one-minute video is watched 100 times. Half of the viewers stop watching after 15 seconds and the rest watch the entire video. None of the viewers watch any parts of the video more than once. In this case, this metric&#x27;s value would be 1 for time buckets in the first quarter of the video, and its value would be 0.50 for the remainder of the video.\"So someone could ask for ratios before, after, and during the ad segment to see if it&#x27;s worth sponsoring them again. On average they can tell how many people skip the segment, how many stop watching entirely, etc. You can also see this on the UI where it shows peaks above the timeline with other users clicking past sponsored content. reply 101008 7 hours agorootparentprevYes, but if SponsorBlock or any other solution like that starts to become popular, sponsors will stop paying creators. reply kzshantonu 3 hours agorootparentHow is it fair for creators to take my premium money AND force me to watch sponsor segments? That&#x27;s double dipping. YouTube should have a system for marking segments so premium users don&#x27;t have to watch those segments. Premium users pay with premium money and free users pay by watching YouTube ads + sponsor segments. Fair in my book reply shiroiuma 7 hours agorootparentprevLike it or not, the whole way \"free\" services on the internet work with ad-blocking, and always have, is that the people blocking ads are taking advantage of technological measures to avoid them, so that the actual cost of serving content is paid (by ad-viewing time) by all the suckers who don&#x27;t know how to block ads, or don&#x27;t want to for some reason. It&#x27;s basically like that with sponsor segments, though here I think it&#x27;s more like a television or newspaper ad: the sponsor is simply hoping enough people will watch the segment and go buy their stuff (since it&#x27;s personally recommended by the content creator!!) to make their sponsorship investment worthwhile. reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparentprevThe only way SponsorBlock will become popular is if a huge fraction of YouTube users switch to 3rd-party clients. I have a really hard time seeing that happening; that would be like most Mac and Windows users all switching to Linux. reply yjftsjthsd-h 4 hours agorootparentprevAmusingly, a person could pay for YouTube Premium (thereby, allegedly, giving the creators more money) and still use sponsorblock to block the double-dipped inline ads. reply TRiG_Ireland 46 minutes agorootparentMost people I watch on YouTube are either not sponsored or on Nebula, so I just watch there instead. reply eviks 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are more than 2 options reply thomasfl 1 hour agoprevI just love the domain name of this Invidious powered website https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yewtu.be. reply rorychatt 9 hours agoprevIs this legal?In Google&#x27;s Terms and Conditions, it&#x27;s says that bypassing ads violates Youtube&#x27;s terms and conditions. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;youtube&#x2F;answer&#x2F;14129599?hl=en#:~:.... reply effie 7 hours agoparentJust because something is written in terms and conditions, does not mean it is the word of God (or courts).More generally, do you have to legally agree to Terms and Conditions to communicate with service provider&#x27;s servers over HTTPS?

On top of that, YouTube can also put ads on videos even if creators haven&#x27;t set them up, in which case the money does not go to the creators.As such it hasn&#x27;t been worth it for creators to rely solely on advertising revenue or YouTube premium revenue for a while. YouTube, through its total disregard for creators, has long since made it not a stable source of income in the way that the others can be. reply Nextgrid 9 hours agoparentprevAdvertising is a terrible business model with many negative externalities up to threatening democracy. The sooner we get rid of it the sooner we&#x27;ll have a viable and ethical alternative.Given the value of the average ad impression, a micropayment system that charged cents to each user is all you need. The problem at the moment is that while advertising is \"good enough\" there&#x27;s little market pressure for publishers&#x2F;creators to align on a common micropayments system. reply raggi 8 hours agorootparentYouTube offers an alternative model: YouTube premium. reply Conscat 6 hours agorootparentI still get ads for obviously awful products at the start of some videos. Neither YouTube Premium nor adblocks can stop a creator from telling me about the latest monthly razor subscription for me to buy. reply eviks 5 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not an alternative to the described micropayments system since this is an expensive bundle that doesn&#x27;t depend on usage, so almost the opposite reply loloquwowndueo 10 hours agoparentprevOh you mean the 99% of “creators” flooding YouTube with repetitive and ai-generated crap content to leverage ad revenue “ethically”? They can go pound sand as far as I’m concerned.There is great content in YouTube for sure but let’s face it, 99% is garbage designed to 1) latch on to popular trends to get more views and 2) use that to show ads and generate revenue for what’s essentially no content at all - just random garbage. reply Reubend 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not productive to say that 99% of the people contributing content are making garbage. Even if that were true, the 1% of good creators are equally affected by a lack of ad revenue as the bad ones.The parent comment is basically pointing out that you&#x27;re depriving the creators you watch of ad revenue. If you sponsor the creators you watch directly, that&#x27;s great! But most people don&#x27;t, and even for the people on HN I suspect that they watch a lot more different channels than just the ones they sponsor. reply eddythompson80 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m assuming they are referring to the other 1%.
