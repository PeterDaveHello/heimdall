Last Write Wins Register Last Write Wins Map Next Steps Have you heard about CRDTs and wondered what they are? Maybe you’ve looked into them a bit, but ran into a wall of academic papers and math jargon? That was me before I started my Recurse Center batch. But I’ve spent the past month or so doing research and writing code, and it turns out that you can build a lot with just a few simple things! In this two-part series, we’ll learn what a CRDT is. Then we’ll write a primitive CRDT, compose it into more complex data structures, and finally use what we’ve learned to build a collaborative pixel art editor. All of this assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs, and only a rudimentary knowledge of TypeScript. To pique your curiosity, this is what we’ll end up with: Draw by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Change the paint color by using the color input on the bottom left. You can draw on either canvas and your changes will show up on the other, as if they were collaborating on the same picture. Clicking the network button prevents changes from reaching the other canvas (although they’ll sync up again when they come back “online”). The latency slider adds a delay before changes on one canvas show up on the other. We’ll build that in the next post. First, we need to learn about CRDTs! What is a CRDT? Okay, let’s start from the top. CRDT stands for “Conflict-free Replicated Data Type”. That’s a long acronym, but the concept isn’t too complicated. It’s a kind of data structure that can be stored on different computers (peers). Each peer can update its own state instantly, without a network request to check with other peers. Peers may have different states at different points in time, but are guaranteed to eventually converge on a single agreed-upon state. That makes CRDTs great for building rich collaborative apps, like Google Docs and Figma — without requiring a central server to sync changes. Broadly, there are two kinds of CRDTs: state-based and operation-based.1 State-based CRDTs transmit their full state between peers, and a new state is obtained by merging all the states together. Operation-based CRDTs transmit only the actions that users take, which can be used to calculate a new state. That might make operation-based CRDTs sound way better. For example, if a user updates one item in a list, an operation-based CRDT can send a description of only that update, while a state-based CRDT has to send the whole list! The drawback is that operation-based CRDTs impose constraints on the communication channel: messages must be delivered exactly once, in causal order, to each peer.2 This post will exclusively focus on on state-based CRDTs. For brevity, I’ll just say “CRDTs” from here on out, but know that I’m referring specifically to state-based CRDTs. I’ve been talking about what CRDTs do, but what is a CRDT? Let’s make it concrete: a CRDT is any data structure that implements this interface:3 interface CRDT { value: T; state: S; merge(state: S): void; } That is to say, a CRDT contains at least three things: A value, T. This is the part the rest of our program cares about. The entire point of the CRDT is to reliably sync the value between peers. A state, S. This is the metadata needed for peers to agree on the same value. To update other peers, the whole state is serialized and sent to them. A merge function. This is a function that takes some state (probably received from another peer) and merges it with the local state. The merge function must satisfy three properties to ensure that all peers arrive at the same result (I’ll use the notation A ∨ B to indicate merging state A into state B): Commutativity: states can be merged in any order; A ∨ B = B ∨ A. If Alice and Bob exchange states, they can each merge the other’s state into their own and arrive at the same result. Associativity: when merging three (or more) states, it doesn’t matter which are merged first; (A ∨ B) ∨ C = A ∨ (B ∨ C). If Alice receives states from both Bob and Carol, she can merge them into her own state in any order and the result will be the same.4 Idempotence: merging a state with itself doesn’t change the state; A ∨ A = A. If Alice merges her own state with itself, the result will be the same state she started with. Mathematically proving that a merge function has all these properties might sound hard. But luckily, we don’t have to do that! Instead, we can just combine CRDTs that already exist, leaning on the fact that someone has proven these things for us. Speaking of CRDTs that already exist: let’s learn about one! Last Write Wins Register A register is a CRDT that holds a single value. There are a couple kinds of registers, but the simplest is the Last Write Wins Register (or LWW Register). LWW Registers, as the name suggests, simply overwrite their current value with the last value written. They determine which write occurred last using timestamps, represented here by integers that increment whenever the value is updated.5 Here’s the algorithm: If the received timestamp is less than the local timestamp, the register doesn’t change its state. If the received timestamp is greater than the local timestamp, the register overwrites its local value with the received value. It also stores the received timestamp and some sort of identifier unique to the peer that last wrote the value (the peer ID). Ties are broken by comparing the local peer ID to the peer ID in the received state. Try it out with the playground below. Did you get a sense for how LWW Registers work? Here are a couple specific scenarios to try: Turn the network off, make a bunch of updates to bob, and then turn it back on. When you send updates from alice, they’ll be rejected until the timestamp exceeds bob’s timestamp. Perform the same setup, but once you turn the network back on, send an update from bob to alice. Notice how the timestamps are now synced up and alice can write to bob again! Increase the latency and send an update from both peers simultaneously. alice will accept bob’s update, but bob will reject alice‘s. Since bob’s peer ID is greater, it breaks the timestamp tie. Here’s the code for the LWW Register: class LWWRegister { readonly id: string; state: [peer: string, timestamp: number, value: T]; get value() { return this.state[2]; } constructor(id: string, state: [string, number, T]) { this.id = id; this.state = state; } set(value: T) { // set the peer ID to the local ID, increment the local timestamp by 1 and set the value this.state = [this.id, this.state[1] + 1, value]; } merge(state: [peer: string, timestamp: number, value: T]) { const [remotePeer, remoteTimestamp] = state; const [localPeer, localTimestamp] = this.state; // if the local timestamp is greater than the remote timestamp, discard the incoming value if (localTimestamp > remoteTimestamp) return; // if the timestamps are the same but the local peer ID is greater than the remote peer ID, discard the incoming value if (localTimestamp === remoteTimestamp && localPeer > remotePeer) return; // otherwise, overwrite the local state with the remote state this.state = state; } } Let’s see how this stacks up to the CRDT interface: state is a tuple of the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp of the last write and the value stored in the register. value is simply the last element of the state tuple. merge is a method that implements the algorithm described above. LWW Registers have one more method named set, which is called locally to set the register’s value. It also updates the local metadata, recording the local peer ID as the last writer and incrementing the local timestamp by one. That’s it! Although it appears simple, the humble LWW Register is a powerful building block with which we can create actual applications. Last Write Wins Map Most programs involve more than one value,6 which means we’ll need a more complex CRDT than the LWW Register. The one we’ll learn about today is called the Last Write Wins Map (or LWW Map). Let’s start by defining a couple types. First, our value type: type Value = { [key: string]: T; }; If each individual map value holds type T, then the value of the entire LWW Map is a mapping of string keys to T values. Here’s our state type: type State = { [key: string]: LWWRegister[\"state\"]; }; Do you see the trick? From our application’s perspective, the LWW Map just holds normal values — but it actually holds LWW Registers. When we look at the full state, each key’s state is the state of the LWW Register at that key.7 I want to pause on that for a moment, because it’s important. Composition lets us combine primitive CRDTs into more complex ones. When it’s time to merge, all the parent does is pass slices of incoming state to the appropriate child’s merge function. We can nest this process as many times as we want; each complex CRDT passing ever-smaller slices of state down to the next level, until we finally hit a primitive CRDT that performs the actual merge. From this perspective, the LWW Map merge function is simple: iterate through each key and hand off the incoming state at that key to the corresponding LWW Register to merge. Try it out in the playground below: It’s kind of difficult to trace what’s happening here, so let’s split up the state for each key. Note, though, that this is just a visualization aid; the full state is still being transmitted as a single unit. Try increasing the latency and then updating different keys on each peer. You’ll see that each peer accepts the updated value with a higher timestamp, while rejecting the value with a lower timestamp. The full LWW Map class is kinda beefy, so let’s go through each property one by one. Here’s the start of it: class LWWMap { readonly id = \"\"; #data = new Map>(); constructor(id: string, state: State) { this.id = id; // create a new register for each key in the initial state for (const [key, register] of Object.entries(state)) { this.#data.set(key, new LWWRegister(this.id, register)); } } } #data is a private property holding a map of the keys to LWW Register instances. To instantiate a LWW Map with preexisting state, we need to iterate through the state and instantiate each LWW Register. Remember, CRDTs need three properties: value, state and merge. We’ll look at value first: get value() { const value: Value = {}; // build up an object where each value is set to the value of the register at the corresponding key for (const [key, register] of this.#data.entries()) { if (register.value !== null) value[key] = register.value; } return value; } It’s a getter that iterates through the keys and gets each register’s value. As far as the rest of the app is concerned, it’s just normal map! Now let’s look at state: get state() { const state: State = {}; // build up an object where each value is set to the full state of the register at the corresponding key for (const [key, register] of this.#data.entries()) { if (register) state[key] = register.state; } return state; } Similar to value, it’s a getter that builds up a map from each register’s state. There’s a clear trend here: iterating through the keys in #data and handing things off to the register stored at that key. You’d think merge would work the same way, but it’s a little more involved: merge(state: State) { // recursively merge each key's register with the incoming state for that key for (const [key, remote] of Object.entries(state)) { const local = this.#data.get(key); // if the register already exists, merge it with the incoming state if (local) local.merge(remote); // otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the incoming state else this.#data.set(key, new LWWRegister(this.id, remote)); } } First, we iterate through the incoming state parameter rather than the local #data. That’s because if the incoming state is missing a key that #data has, we know that we don’t need to touch that key.8 For each key in the incoming state, we get the local register at that key. If we find one, the peer is updating an existing key that we already know about, so we call that register’s merge method with the incoming state at that key. Otherwise, the peer has added a new key to the map, so we instantiate a new LWW Register using the incoming state at that key. In addition to the CRDT methods, we need to implement methods more commonly found on maps: set, get, delete and has. Let’s start with set: set(key: string, value: T) { // get the register at the given key const register = this.#data.get(key); // if the register already exists, set the value if (register) register.set(value); // otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the value else this.#data.set(key, new LWWRegister(this.id, [this.id, 1, value])); } Just like in the merge method, we’re either calling the register’s set to update an existing key, or instantiating a new LWW Register to add a new key. The initial state uses the local peer ID, a timestamp of 1 and the value passed to set. get is even simpler: get(key: string) { return this.#data.get(key)?.value ?? undefined; } Get the register from the local map, and return its value if it has one. Why coalesce to undefined? Because each register holds Tnull. And with the delete method, we’re ready to explain why: delete(key: string) { // set the register to null, if it exists this.#data.get(key)?.set(null); } Rather than fully removing the key from the map, we set the register value to null. The metadata is kept around so we can disambiguate deletions from states that simply don’t have a key yet. These are called tombstones — the ghosts of CRDTs past. Consider what would happen if we really did delete the keys from the map, rather than leaving a tombstone. Here’s a playground where peers can add keys, but not delete them. Can you figure out how to get a peer to delete a key? Turn off the network, add a key to alice’s map, then turn the network back on. Finally, make a change to bob’s map. Since alice sees that the incoming state from bob is missing that key, she removes it from her own state — even though bob never knew about that key in the first place. Whoops! Here’s a playground with the correct behavior. You can also see what happens when a key is deleted. Notice how we never remove deleted keys from the map. This is one drawback to CRDTs — we can only ever add information, not remove it. Although from the application’s perspective the key has been fully deleted, the underlying state still records that the key was once there. In technical terms, we say that CRDTs are monotonically increasing data structures.9 The final LWW Map method is has, which returns a boolean indicating whether the map contains a given key. has(key: string) { // if a register doesn't exist or its value is null, the map doesn't contain the key return this.#data.get(key)?.value !== null; } There’s a special case here: if the map contains a register at the given key, but the register contains null, the map is considered to not contain the key. For posterity, here’s the full LWW Map code: class LWWMap { readonly id: string; #data = new Map>(); constructor(id: string, state: State) { this.id = id; // create a new register for each key in the initial state for (const [key, register] of Object.entries(state)) { this.#data.set(key, new LWWRegister(this.id, register)); } } get value() { const value: Value = {}; // build up an object where each value is set to the value of the register at the corresponding key for (const [key, register] of this.#data.entries()) { if (register.value !== null) value[key] = register.value; } return value; } get state() { const state: State = {}; // build up an object where each value is set to the full state of the register at the corresponding key for (const [key, register] of this.#data.entries()) { if (register) state[key] = register.state; } return state; } has(key: string) { return this.#data.get(key)?.value !== null; } get(key: string) { return this.#data.get(key)?.value; } set(key: string, value: T) { // get the register at the given key const register = this.#data.get(key); // if the register already exists, set the value if (register) register.set(value); // otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the value else this.#data.set(key, new LWWRegister(this.id, [this.id, 1, value])); } delete(key: string) { // set the register to null, if it exists this.#data.get(key)?.set(null); } merge(state: State) { // recursively merge each key's register with the incoming state for that key for (const [key, remote] of Object.entries(state)) { const local = this.#data.get(key); // if the register already exists, merge it with the incoming state if (local) local.merge(remote); // otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the incoming state else this.#data.set(key, new LWWRegister(this.id, remote)); } } } Next Steps If you’re reading this now, we’re in the short period when this post has been published, but the next one has not.

I built a product around CRDTs, essentially, and my god was it painful trying to engage with. Showing actual code, explaining that `merge` is the fundamental operation, etc, is really all a developer needs to know IMO.Also, the fact that we always use text editing as the de-facto solution is so weird to me since that problem is both niche and extremely complex. IMO a better example would be something like \"Can this person drink alcohol?\". Age moves in one direction so it has a simple merge function: def set_age(self, new_age: int): self.age = max(self.age, new_age)A property of this is that if I query your age and if you&#x27;re 21 I can cache that age forever. You&#x27;ll only ever be >= 21, after all. If I add new queries that care about you being 25 (for a hotel) I can satisfy the \"drinking age\" queries from a stale cache and then retrieve the true value ( the fact that we always use text editing as the de-facto solution is so weird to me since that problem is both niche and extremely complexThe reason we use that is because it is complex enough to show the problems that CRDTs solve. I would argue that this painting example is too simple. The core merge loop is: if pixel.created_atAge moves in one direction so it has a simple merge function:Better to use date of birth as that doesn&#x27;t change at all. reply steve_adams_86 18 hours agoparentprevThe way you describe that makes me wonder if state machines would be natural tools to express CRDT “states”. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentThe important this is that, as mentioned in the article, you need to have a way to converge states in a way that obeys certain properties. reply steve_adams_86 17 hours agorootparentYeah, as I’m reading this more thoroughly I see that there wouldn’t be many states to express, and the merging itself isn’t something you’d express in states.I initially thought more of the inner workings could be managed this way, but it seems better implemented as it is in the article. reply insanitybit 16 hours agorootparentYou should check out the P language and consider the implications of CRDTs on the `machine` constructs :) reply Racing0461 6 hours agoparentprevWhat if i set the wrong dob and i need to change it? reply alephnan 18 hours agoparentprev> text editing as the de-facto solution is so weird to me since that problem is both niche and extremely complex.My first foray into collaborative editing was for my text editor. Indeed, things get super linearly harder as you add basic functionality of editors such as deleting and replacing, especially when those space multiple lines.Instead, I reached for Fraser’s differential syncing. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neil.fraser.name&#x2F;writing&#x2F;sync&#x2F;. There’s a lot of ambiguity and nuances in various versions of the prose and white paper that I could never really flesh out.I think anyone attempting to relay a collaborative editing algorithm needs to do is start with the simplest scenarios: append only &#x2F; monotonically increasing data. reply braden-lk 18 hours agoprevI’ve built a successful business from a TTRPG campaign manager (LegendKeeper) using CRDTs, specifically the Yjs kind. It’s been great, and the UX of CRDT-powered stuff is excellent. Zero latency, eventually consistent; overall users love the performance and offline capability.That said, there are a lot of trade offs. Some things that are easy in a traditional server-client model become difficult in the local-first context that CRDTs provide. Role based authorization is hard, data model changes must be done additive (never mutative), and knowing what state a client is in when debugging is tough too, without a lot of “full-surveillance”-level tooling. Also with the automatic , bidirectional syncing a lot of CRDT architectures afford you, a bug in production that corrupts data can virally propagate and cause a huge headache.Investor-funded services like Liveblocks are starting to pop up that promise to make this stuff easier, but as an indie I find them expensive; I’m sure they’re a great value for big corps or funded teams though. Rolling my own infrastructure for Yjs has been taxing, but I’ve learned a lot, and have been able to tailor it exactly to my needs. reply paulgb 18 hours agoparent> knowing for sure what state a user’s client is in when debugging is tough tooMy team has built an open-source debugger for Yjs that might interest you (docs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;y-sweet.cloud&#x2F;advanced&#x2F;debugger)You mention the investor-funded services that pop up to make this stuff easier -- our goal with Y-Sweet is to build the same type of DX you’d get from those services, but build it on a fully open-source (MIT) platform with Yjs at the core: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;drifting-in-space&#x2F;y-sweet reply janesconference 16 hours agorootparentA couple of questions about y-sweet, based on the experiences I had with CRDTs:1) Does the server keeps in memory the \"active\" documents? In other words, does the server need to open a document and keep it in RAM while clients are connected to it (I assume there&#x27;s a websocket connection somewhere in the client that keeps it hot)? Or is the server stateless - just connects to the store when needed? I found the latter very hard to do.2) Does the client persist entries using indexeddb? If yes, does opening many tabs cause redundant writes as they all sync with the server? If not, does the client need to fully re-sync with the server anytime it wakes up?3) Is it possible to observe updates on the client as they come? One of the major use cases of CRDTs is to index data on the client - then you can have a dumb server that just syncs data between clients and a smart client that does search, graphs, visualizations etc. on the data it receives. To do that, the client needs to observe updates one by one and process them to create secondary indexes. Is it possible to do with y-sweet without forking its source code? I remember getting updates yn Y.js being quite inefficient as you need to replay them all or something similar, but that was a couple of years ago. reply paulgb 16 hours agorootparentGood questions!> 1The server keeps the documents in memory when they are open, but it is horizontally scalable by hosting using CloudFlare Durable Objects. (We also plan to support Plane.dev but that&#x27;s not built out yet).> 2The client is based on Yjs, so it&#x27;s compatible with Yjs&#x27; y-indexeddb provider to store in IndexedDB. Tabs synchronize state between each other using a local broadcast channel. The client only synchronizes unsynced state with the server, so if one tab has already pushed the local offline edits to the server, the other tabs can discover that and avoid pushing them. That said, I&#x27;m not 100% sure if Yjs deals with the race condition where two tabs wake up at the same time so the server has not yet received offline edits from either, I&#x27;d have to check on that.>3Yes, Yjs types have an `observe` method that takes a callback, which receives an event with details of each edit. Here’s an example for observing events of a Y.Map: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.yjs.dev&#x2F;api&#x2F;shared-types&#x2F;y.map#observing-change... reply janesconference 15 hours agorootparentThanks! Re: 1, the docs are not really deep on that, but from your answer it seems it possible to self-host y-sweet on Cloudflare workers (I guess) with Durable Objects as storage? Also, if you guys are going to have a paid plan, how do you see the prices going? Comparable to, say, Supabase per user, less or more? reply paulgb 15 hours agorootparentSorry about that, I’ll clarify the docs. You can self-host on Cloudflare, but the storage is R2&#x2F;S3&#x2F;S3-compatible blob storage.Our tentative pricing is $25&#x2F;month + $10&#x2F;10k minutes of “open connection” time (per-document, not per-connection, so multiple users with the same doc open are not double-counted). Storage is free if you bring your own R2&#x2F;S3 bucket, or a nominal fee if you use ours.Unlike supabase we don’t do any of the relational stuff, but for Figma-like apps where a lot of documents are never touched, I think our hot&#x2F;cold storage model can be significantly cheaper at scale than a hosted postgres database like supabase. reply braden-lk 18 hours agorootparentprevOoh hell yeah; excited to check this out. reply doctorpangloss 15 hours agoparentprev> data model changes must be done additive (never mutative)Sounds painful. It means your mutative data model changes, which exist, live somewhere else. reply braden-lk 15 hours agorootparentYep, though coming from mobile development this was somewhat familiar. A lot of mobile apps are local-first, but I don&#x27;t think it was called that back when I was doing mobile. Most mobile platforms expect this and provide tools to ease migrations, like Room on Android. Since CRDT approaches are still fresh, I imagine most people are rolling their own adhoc migration strategies.

What happens if you have many users or a bunch of users with huge history on their data? If you haven&#x27;t hit these limitations, what do you plan to do when (if) you hit them? reply braden-lk 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know how well the original y-websocket provider scales, as it holds ydocs in memory. I imagine lots of folks are using it just fine in production, though. I wrote a less-stateful version of y-websocket that uses the Yjs Differential Updates API to save and serve updates without loading the docs into memory.As long as you have garbage collection turned on for your Ydocs, they stay pretty small, especially if you are avoiding using YMaps. (The strings that serve as YMap keys can&#x27;t be GC&#x27;d, from what I understand. YMaps are great for bounded domain objects, but not so great for storing collections, dictionary-style. Y-KeyValue solves this problem.)I eventually added a X MB document size limit on the backend, but only after doing a statistical analysis on existing documents. I found a size threshold that was a strong indicator of abnormal&#x2F;buggy behavior, and set a limit under that. Without the limit, occasionally I had huge Ydocs, usually created by a bug or weird user behavior, clogging up database resources. Now I block those ydocs on the backend and send a messsage to the user with some mitigation&#x2F;recovery tips. I plan to add automatic document repair, but just haven&#x27;t gotten to it yet.

Acronyms Seriously Suck. reply jongjong 4 hours agoprevSomething important to mention when discussing CRDTs is that they are particularly suited for scenarios where clients may go offline often and where it makes sense to resolve conflicts automatically. Not every kind of data lends itself well to automatic conflict resolution as the merged state may not be desirable when all parts are constructed independently without real-time collaborative feedback.For example, if I have a field which is \"color\" and one person writes red and the other writes blue, there is no way to automatically resolve that conflict when they both become reconnected. It&#x27;s physically impossible since the intent cannot be established without the ability to read the minds of both participants. You can&#x27;t just merge the letters into the word \"reblued\" nor can you allow one to completely overwrite the other while letting both participants believe that their change was settled when in fact, only one made it through. Often, it&#x27;s desirable that both participants must be online and better to show one an error message if they&#x27;re not so that they are not mislead into thinking that they&#x27;re actually changing the system state when in fact their change hasn&#x27;t been persisted.I&#x27;ve worked on realtime systems which don&#x27;t rely on CRDTs. This was a suitable approach in my case since accuracy of the data was paramount and each section of the data was well isolated from one another and offline editing was not required. reply lelanthran 1 hour agoparent> For example, if I have a field which is \"color\" and one person writes red and the other writes blue, there is no way to automatically resolve that conflict when they both become reconnected. It&#x27;s physically impossible since the intent cannot be established without the ability to read the minds of both participants. You can&#x27;t just merge the letters into the word \"reblued\" nor can you allow one to completely overwrite the other while letting both participants believe that their change was settled when in fact, only one made it through.This, for me, is the crux of the issue that I can not understand - a general CRDT library simply cannot work, as the changes are in context of what is being edited.IOW, I cannot think of a situation where conflicts can be resolved automatically. I think it might be best for the application (which does have context) to display the conflicted state (like the way git does), marking it as a conflict and requiring manual intervention to resolve.In this example, perhaps the application can display the field? If the field is displayed as text, then display \"Conflict: {[joe:~blue~][bob:~red~]}\". If the field is being displayed as a colored element in an image, the conflict must be displayed with (for example) an overlay on the conflicted part as a red-outlined box, with the snippet of both changes to the image displayed on mouse-over, or on click (or similar).It makes no sense, to me, to approach CRDTs as a general mechanism - it&#x27;ll be a CRDT for text, a different mechanism for rasterised images, another one for vector graphics, another for video, for sound, etc. reply splashdown5 16 hours agoprevWe used CRDTs to build Pennant notebooks (think Jupyter Notebooks with collaborative Google Docs features https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pennant-notebook.github.io&#x2F;).

It borrows heavily from some of the CRDT ideas, but it&#x27;s really an editable tree where most changes are atomic and thus use a last-writer-wins approach. That, and re-ordering tree nodes uses fractional indexing. reply auggierose 18 hours agorootparentYes, I think most practical solutions are not strictly CRDTs, not even Automerge, I think. reply wim 18 hours agorootparentRight, there are quite some collaborative applications for which a hybrid approach is useful. We&#x27;re building a collaborative editor (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thymer.com) for example, where the underlying data structure is also a tree (as the text documents also support outliner-like features, so a flat list of characters&#x2F;lines isn&#x27;t enough). To avoid tree conflicts, insert and move operations look more like OT than CRDT however, where other updates can use a simple CRDT mutation. reply Rapzid 13 hours agorootparentprevAutomerge is interesting as it&#x27;s an op-based CRDT system vs state-based.. This should make use cases involving a central authority easier to work with but.. Their docs lack any detail useful to taking advantage of this haha. reply unholiness 17 hours agoparentprevOnce you start adding enough complexity, there will arise cases that the primitives are an awkward place for the merging to happen. There will arise cases where that user expectations and the merge function behavior don&#x27;t agree. There will arise cases where the server can do a better job than the client at applying the change. There will arise cases where you need to undo but the undo function violates the merge function. And as the author freely states, there will arise cases where sending the whole state is prohibitively slow.Those are really only issues with state-based CRDTs. The fundamental concepts behind operation-based CRDTs vs operational transforms vs bespoke hybrid approaches aren&#x27;t really different. It&#x27;s all about determining an unambiguous order, then getting everyone to update their state as if it had been applied in that order.

CRDTs don’t assume that there is a fully-ordered stream of updates, so there is no “last update” per se. reply tcoff91 9 hours agorootparentYeah so something like a last write wins + hybrid logical clocks for ordering is a crdt then. reply endisneigh 19 hours agorootparentprevreally? you have a link to a blog post or something? last I heard they explicitly did not use them. reply ko_pivot 19 hours agorootparentIn production, they don’t. This is evident when two users try to edit the same block at the same time — its last writer wins right now, not merging. They have hired some engineers to work on a CRDT text editor implementation though. reply jakelazaroff 18 hours agorootparentNo idea whether Notion uses CRDTs, but last writer wins is a (naive) strategy for editing text. You can see this in the article — if you edit the LWW Map, for example, even though the keys are merged, each value will be taken from one peer or the other. Once you get to that last “primitive” CRDT — the register holding each map value — updates are atomic. So Notion may be using CRDTs for e.g. the order of blocks in a page, but not (yet?) using them to merge text. reply auggierose 19 hours agorootparentprevNo, Notion uses OT (operational transform). reply flatline 19 hours agoparentprevGoogle docs, really any online collaborative editor uses them. If you have a distributed system with multiple asynchronous data feeds into the same sink, this is one way of automatically resolving conflicts. A complicated way that most applications probably don’t really need, and that does not guarantee consistency. But they are neat. reply papercrane 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure Google Docs use Operational transformation (OT). Google Docs pre-dates the paper that defined CRDTs. It&#x27;s certainly possible they&#x27;ve updated their algorithms since then though. reply rubatuga 18 hours agorootparentprevSource? Heard Google Docs stopped using CRDT. reply thoughtlede 14 hours agoprevI have studied CRDTs at a deeper level for a few weeks and implemented several small prototypes. They are fascinating. As an eventual consistency model for data management, CRDT inspired techniques (op-based or state-based) are useful.However, for building user-facing applications with CRDTs, their importance is unclear.The question with CRDTs and local-first paradigms has always been the pressing need (or the lack thereof). The only one plausible &#x27;need&#x27; that CRDTs serve is real-time collaboration and that too with a squinting eye.Real-time collaboration support translates, in practice, to text-editing and picture-editing collaboration. Google docs and the ilk have solved that problem (using central solutions). A CRDT-inspired central-solution like Figma is inspiring, and maybe that&#x27;s the only place CRDTs fit in their survival quest when combating against central-solutions.The rest of the claimed advantages seem to not withstand the test of times. This articles talks about 7 features of CRDTs [1].Fast: Things are already fast with central solutions.Multi-device: There is multi-device support with almost all solutions (if you decouple the real-time collaboration aspect).Offline: It&#x27;s rare, at least in first world countries, to be in a need for offline access (except maybe in airplanes).Longevity: As can be seen from another comment here, longevity is actually a problem with CRDTs because data model updates are not easy.Privacy: With BYOK encryption pattern, privacy is not as much an issue.User control: Even with CRDTs, user is not in control of their data - other peers can mess with your data.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inkandswitch.com&#x2F;local-first&#x2F; reply jakelazaroff 8 hours agoparentAuthor here! I think if you&#x27;re just concerned with efficiency (speed&#x2F;low overhead&#x2F;etc) centralized solutions will always beat decentralized ones. The key advantage you can get with CRDTs — and, more generally, decentralized applications — is stability. By which I mean: Figma and Google Docs are great, but they can go out of business or delete your account or up their prices, and everything you&#x27;ve poured your time and energy into making just vanishes.It&#x27;s not just this way for collaboration software. Servers make everything more brittle. A few years ago, I tried to restore every website I&#x27;ve ever made. Static files were easy, things that relied on old versions of server-side languages were harder and anything stored on a server or in a database was just gone. That sucks. I want us to be able to keep our memories forever, not lose them because we stopped paying a hosting bill. reply thoughtlede 7 hours agorootparentEvolution of technology makes things unstable, not specifically servers. A decentralized application is not more stable than a centralized one. It depends on what&#x27;s prioritized about the product. For example, you can still use SMTP servers developed several decades ago to send email to others.Also, it is hard to buy the argument that docs based on Google Docs will live less longer than docs served by some CRDT-based collaborative application. It is easy to argue the opposite. My Google doc history shows docs I have even forgotten ever existed, and Google docs play nice with Microsoft Word - making it interoperable with the largest ecosystem around structured documents. Again, this is about product features and prioritization, not underlying building blocks.CRDTs hold a very special place in my heart. But I also believe they don&#x27;t offer a differentiated solution - on the user facing side. reply jakelazaroff 4 hours agorootparentDecentralized applications aren’t inherently more stable than applications that rely on central servers. But the ceiling is higher. Infrastructure is coupling, and coupling makes things brittle.Yes, if everything goes right, a centralized service will probably do a better job of keeping your files around than you will. But I have way more stories where something went wrong and I lost them. reply ochiba 13 hours agoparentprevI agree. We had similar conclusions around the implementation of PowerSync (sync engine enabling offline-first applications).

MATT STOLLER SEP 27, 2023 279 17 Share Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so here. Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states filed an antitrust suit against Amazon, one of the biggest companies in the world, for monopolization and unfair methods of competition. This piece is about what this case means, the government’s claims, and whether the legal arguments are strong. Jeff Bezos just wants to delight you. There’s No Such Thing as “Free” Shipping For almost 20 years, Amazon’s business has existed on a very strange premise that almost no one questions. Ostensibly, the retail firm is the lowest price option in the market, and it offers “free shipping” to over 100 million Amazon Prime customers, for which it charges a $139 a year membership fee. The revenue from Prime does not come close to covering the cost of its logistics arm, which was $85 billion in 2022. According to one J.P. Morgan analyst, the actual value of Prime is roughly $1,000 for a customer, which means that Amazon is subsidizing its Prime business to the tune of tens of billions of dollars a year. Where is this money coming from? To put it differently, how can Amazon be the lowest-cost retailer and offer free shipping, all while making money? A lot of people have tried to argue that this is some grand technological feat, or business genius. But the answer, as it turns out, is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Consumers pay for the free shipping, it’s just a hidden tax baked into the price of what you buy through an extraordinarily clever scheme put forward by Amazon. And that’s what the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states are suing over. This hidden tax is well-known in the industry. Here’s Mike Beckham, the CEO of Simple Modern and an exceptionally successful retailer, making that point in August. Amazon Prime Is Bait Most people think of Amazon as a retailer who sells to retail customers. But retail end users — you and me — aren’t really the customer. We are the product. And Amazon doesn’t really sell to us; it’s a middleman who sells access to us. The actual customers of Amazon are third-party businesses that rely on Amazon’s infrastructure to get their wares to the public. In 2022, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said this explicitly, “small and medium sized” sellers use Amazon not because of the “eCommerce software” Amazon provides but “because they get access to a few hundred million customers.” There are extremely high switching costs to move from one online superstore to another, so this is a business with significant barriers to entry. Indeed, this barrier to entry is baked into the very structure of Amazon Prime and its free shipping, which was created, Jeff Bezos said, “to draw a moat around our best customers.” Here’s how the FTC complaint describes the allure of Prime, which is a bundle of services customers would prefer to order separately. “This current restrictive structure of Prime reflects a deliberate strategy by Amazon to artificially increase barriers to entry and competition. As one former Amazon executive explained in recalling Amazon's motivation for adding non-shipping services to Prime, ‘[a]ny competitor might launch a Prime shipping clone, or they could potentially build a new Netflix-type service, but it was unlikely that any one of them would be able to do both.’” Amazon’s strategy is to use Prime to build, extend, and fortify barriers to entry. One result of Prime is that Amazon now has an overwhelming monopoly share of online shoppers. And online shoppers aren’t the customer, but the product that Amazon brokers to third-party sellers, who must either pay Amazon what it demands or lose access to the market. As one seller put it, \"We have nowhere else to go and Amazon knows it.\" Once it achieved monopoly power, Amazon squeezed on price through fees to third-party sellers. As a third-party seller, you pay fees for listing on Amazon; for using Amazon’s warehouse services, known as Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA); and for advertising services. If you don’t pay, you don’t get put in a place on the site where consumers click. \"Advertised products on Amazon,” reads the complaint, “are 46 times more likely to be clicked on when compared with products that are not advertised.\" And these fees have all increased steadily over the years. At this point, the price Amazon charges these third party sellers has grown to nearly 50% of its revenue. It is this money, estimated at $123 billion in total last year, that pays for “free” shipping, as well as its video service, its music service, Twitch, and everything else that comes bundled with Prime. These third-party sellers in turn raise their prices to consumers, aka you and me, and then send that money back to Amazon in the form of fees. It’s basically money laundering. This dynamic increasingly ruins the consumer experience. Amazon is now so full of pay-to-play ads that consumers are complaining they can’t find organic results, but are instead directed to higher priced items. In the red box are sponsored links, which are hard to distinguish from organic best results. As the FTC noted, one “senior Amazon executive reportedly compared Amazon's advertising and search divisions to the parable of the scorpion and the frog: it was in the advertising division's nature as the proverbial ‘scorpion’ to poison organic search results.\" The Anti-Discounting Algorithm Still, why can’t a third-party seller offer a lower price outside of Amazon? Good question! That’s where the scheme gets very clever. Originally, Amazon imposed contracts, as the FTC noted, “barring all sellers from offering their goods for lower prices anywhere else.” But Europeans, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, complained about these price parity agreements, so Amazon dropped its explicit contractual requirements in 2019. However, this change was a farce. The firm simply did through code what it couldn’t do through contract. \"Amazon,” claims the FTC, “has implemented an algorithm for the express purpose of deterring other online stores from offering lower prices.\" Just weeks after dropping this requirement, Amazon wrote it would not change its policies, as California’s attorney general revealed in April. The firm even speculated that “media and selling partners may claim the removal of the clause was not only trivial but a trick and an attempt to garner goodwill with policymakers amid increasing competition concerns.” Today, Amazon tells sellers that if it detects a lower price for their products on any other online store, they will be punished, which is to say, their ability to get their products onto a place on the Amazon website where customers click will go away. The net effect, as Amazon itself wrote, is that \"prices will go up.\" BIG is a reader-supported newsletter focused on the politics of monopoly and finance. If you haven't done so already, please consider upgrading to a paid subscription. After all, you can get lies for free, but in the end paying a few bucks for the truth is much cheaper. Subscribe Indeed, Amazon tells third-party sellers to raise prices. In 2019, a seller complained to Amazon that they were being asked “to take our prices down [on Amazon] to match our own [website] store.” Amazon’s VP of Pricing told the seller’s account manager that “[Y]ou might want to ask him to check if his sales on other sites directly or through distributors is putting him and us at a relative competitive disadvantage… He might get the hint. :)” If this whole scheme sounds familiar, it’s because I described it in May of 2021 when then-D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine filed a similar though much less developed suit, in a piece called “Amazon Prime Is an Economy-Distorting Lie.” Racine left out some key details, and got a bad judge, so that case was dismissed, though it’s on appeal. California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a very similar suit, which has survived important procedural elements and will go to trial. Another related suit, this one class action, in Washington state also passed a summary judgment. The overall point is that Amazon is degrading the shopping experience, raising prices, and yet somehow still gaining market share. It is able to block third-party sellers from going elsewhere, and therefore also stop potential rivals from gaining share. It’s a fairly strong complaint, and while antitrust cases are always random, Bill Baer, the former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust under the Obama administration, said it’s a strong argument. “If the FTC and states can prove even some of the factual allegations in this 172 page complaint,” he said, “Amazon is in a world of hurt.” If this suit is resolved in the government’s favor, the remedy could be anything from ending anti-discounting measures to breaking up the firm. Regardless, there will be lower prices and discounting all over the web, and a lot of new firms will be able to enter the market. As one legal analyst told me last year, “Let's say a product today is sold for $10 on Amazon with 'free shipping'. If Amazon is forced to unbundle the FBA fee from the product price then it would cost $6 + $4 shipping. Prime makes no sense in this world unless Amazon again decided to subsidize Prime.” And even Amazon doesn’t have the tens of billions of dollars required to do that. Indeed, the stakes here are one reason that antitrust legend Bill Kovacic called the Amazon complaint “the most important case that the FTC has brought in its 109-year history.” Secrecy and Project Nessie One of the more disturbing trends in antitrust is how secretive courts have become on antitrust matters. I wrote this up on Sunday in my piece on how Judge Amit Mehta is hiding the Google trial, and the New York Times did a big story on the “unprecedented” secrecy of the trial, which does seem to have embarrassed Mehta. Journalists are getting increasingly angry over these redactions and closed sessions, because they want to write about stuff, and when you remove all the interesting tidbits it means they can’t. (The same journalists who cover the Google trial are also covering the Amazon complaint.) Much of the interesting information in this Amazon complaint is redacted, including two particular elements I want to highlight. The first is that Amazon, like Google, has been destroying documents and internal conversations. The extent of their perfidy is not clear, since the paragraph alleging wrongdoing is redacted. The second is something called Project Nessie, which is an algorithmic pricing system so egregious that the FTC determined that it deserved its own charge as an unfair method of competition. What is Project Nessie? I don’t know, since nearly all of the information about it is redacted. But it looks fascinating. Fortunately, our work on the secrecy of the Google trial is paying dividends. Here’s FTC official Douglas Farrar arguing that the commission will push to get rid of the redactions: We share the frustration that much of the data and quotes by Amazon executives in the complaint that describe what we allege is monopolistic and illegal behavior is redacted. Amazon has 14 days from the entry of a temporary sealing order to provide legitimate justification for preventing this information from being revealed. We do not believe that there are compelling reasons to keep much of this information secret from the public. So there we go. This has been an extraordinary week, and it’s only Wednesday.

    "commentBody": "The FTC sues to break up Amazon over an economy-wide “hidden tax”Hacker NewspastloginThe FTC sues to break up Amazon over an economy-wide “hidden tax” (thebignewsletter.com) 687 points by PaulHoule 22 hours ago| hidepastfavorite585 comments cwoolfe 18 hours agoThis strategy has been adopted by eBay as well and artificially drives up prices. Let me elaborate.Recently, eBay has made it so that only the products with paid ads are shown in places where customers click. This drives up the cost of everything by more than 10% which is eBay&#x27;s ad fee. I refused to buy a paid ad to sell my MacBook. It sat on the site for a month, which is highly unusual for an in-demand and rightly priced product. Finally I lowered the price enough to get it sold.Most consumers use the default site, which filters by Recommended (i.e. ads) The play for consumers to win at this new payola ad scheme is to always filter by lowest price (or in amazon&#x27;s case Prime + lowest price)But really, consumers don&#x27;t win (and neither do sellers) because now these ads take up space in supposed \"search results\" for items which don&#x27;t match the search terms (but are close enough) This creates frustration when you are looking for something to meet a specification, like E26 light bulbs for example. Here, it is pointless to show anything that doesn&#x27;t meet that specification and yet the site shows them, and the seller has to pay the ad fee.Please somebody make a site with no payola! reply granzymes 15 hours agoparentYou are touching on a point that Benedict Evans has made quite eloquently in the past:>There was a joke a few years ago that rent is the new [Customer Acquisition Cost], and that now applies to everything. The [Total Addressable Market] for search ads is not ‘advertising’ (let alone online advertising) but everything that is spent to reach and serve a customer, starting with retail rents. This applies to Amazon, but even more to Google - you can ask whether Google’s ads are ‘advertising’ or ‘marketing’, but also ask whether the TAM for buying placement in Google search results is ‘advertising’, ‘marketing’ or just its customers’ operating margins. How do you reach a consumer? Do you spend your budget on TV ads or search ads, or on retail rents, or on giving retailers a margin versus selling direct, or giving the retailer a better price for better placement, or free shipping, or a better returns policy? Everything below P&G’s COGS line is up for grabs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ben-evans.com&#x2F;benedictevans&#x2F;2023&#x2F;3&#x2F;6&#x2F;ways-to-thi...There will be no site that does not offer advertising, because advertising allows the site to determine which sellers can afford to pay more while still being profitable. It&#x27;s a scaled version of the same way a landlord will raise rents on a profitable storefront. reply simpaticoder 12 hours agorootparent>There will be no site that does not offer advertising, because advertising allows the site to determine which sellers can afford to pay more while still being profitable.It&#x27;s still possible that people exist who charge \"what it&#x27;s worth\" rather than \"what they can get\". Those people can still make a fine living off of a two sided market place through flat transaction fees. Craigslist is an example that comes immediately to mind. Smart market participants are already punishing providers that maximize profit with payola, which is leading to success of new smaller niche markets - reverb.com comes to mind, or bricklink.com or alibris.com. That is not to say the market of markets is \"solving\" this problem - we probably want more consumer protection law - but it does show that your startement about ads is, strictly speaking, false. reply balex 2 hours agorootparentThe problem is that \"what it&#x27;s worth\" can only be determined via \"what you can get\". Flat fees are just operational costs + capped profit. And the next question would be, where do you place that cap and why there? reply alsetmusic 11 hours agorootparentprevCraigslist is a hell hole. I stopped selling there because even when I was practically giving electronics away (to prevent buyer’s remorse), people still emailed insultingly low offers. I just gave up on the site maybe five years ago. reply simpaticoder 10 hours agorootparentCL has gotten much much worse over the last few years. So has FB Marketplace. Perhaps a hidden value of the payola approach is to avoid these outcomes. Or perhaps every marketplace declines like this. It may be that private secondary market online market is simply not a sustainable business. That would be unfortunate, but interesting. reply afiori 11 hours agorootparentprevBut you need the entire marketplace to follow that rule.You cannot charge \"what it&#x27;s worth\" on amazon because you either pay the ad tax or you compete for the lowest price. reply codexb 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s going to be a bit harder to win on this end I think. Manufacturer&#x27;s require retailers to agree to this type of restriction all the time time (and it&#x27;s mandatory, not voluntary) like it is with Amazon. reply windexh8er 7 hours agoparentprevI used to sell items on eBay but I&#x27;m back to Craigslist and, for phones and other electronics, I&#x27;ve found Swappa to be a decent marketplace. On the latter products are moderated lightly for validity and, just like eBay, it was easy to build up a very positive reputation by selling items that are clean and have been taken care of well. I do go to eBay as a shopper for random items. But generally if it&#x27;s on eBay I can find a better price by spending a few minutes looking for a site that specializes in those items.I lost trust in selling on eBay due to buyers that have tried to scam me in the past. Not sure if it&#x27;s still that way on the sell side for individuals but I felt like, for a while, eBay was favoring high volume users vs being fair. I sold some SFPs that were way under market value about 6 years ago and had serial numbers of each unit in the auctiom. A guy bought them to resell in his shop a couple states away and he claimed they were defective when he received them. I told him to prove it in a switch showing the serial numbers and the error condition he claimed. He wouldn&#x27;t do it so I told him to ship them back. He shipped me units with way different serial numbers but eBay still gave him his money back and charged me. That&#x27;s the last time I sold on eBay. reply pierat 15 hours agoparentprevThats not the only thing I caught, at least with Ebay.During the pandemic, I decided to sell a bunch of a component I had stockpiled. (Im not a scalper. I got the parts when my dad died.).I put them for sale with $100 minimum, auction. They ended up selling for $300. I was definitely happy.... until Ebay refused to send me my money, and instead demanded access to a bank account, after the sale was complete. Fuck that.I found the user who bought it, traced to a business. Cool. I contacted him, explaining what happened. Turns out they did the same to him since he too was a seller. I told him that I&#x27;d honor the same price Ebay told me....Ebay told me (seller) $300. Ebay told the buyer $350......!! Mind you, the fees are taken out of my $300, yet that $50 difference is Ebays scrape off the top.Obviously, I sold it to them for $300, and provided screenshots of what I was being told, and they did the same. We arranged the sale over Paypal and worked like a charm.And sure, Ebay&#x27;s scamming as far as I can tell, everyone. But it&#x27;s also reminded me to check on websites with a private mode browser and logged in, to see if there&#x27;s funny games. reply NeuroCoder 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s amazing how quickly I recognized eBay descending into this sort of stuff from its inception. Maybe Amazon did so quickly too, but it&#x27;s so obviously scummy that even as a teenager I got this impression. Kudos to you for going the extra mile reply simpaticoder 12 hours agorootparentprevI recently sold some items on ebay. ebay will not release the funds for 3 weeks. They give no reason for this. However I think the real reason is that if you do this over a large enough user base you can use the \"time-value\" of money to make extra money. It&#x27;s nefarious, and I too will never use ebay again. reply OJFord 10 hours agorootparentThe reason they give&#x2F;non-cynical take is that it&#x27;s a hold for potential buyer dispute. If they do, and eBay decides in their favour (to refund or partially refund) then it ensures they already&#x2F;still have your money, they don&#x27;t have to try to bill you back for it. (Which would also have an associated cost, but surely the main aspect would just be already having it, you haven&#x27;t run off with it, not unable or unwilling to pay it, etc.) reply 93po 14 hours agorootparentprevWow, this is wildly unethical and shitty.

I guess I’d say the big difference is that you’re asking “what should happen to rogue execs”, and I was more interested in the general “who is culpable for the actions undertaken by an organization? Can the organization itself be culpable?”In that metaphor, I see it like this: you live in a big estate that operates as some sort of business (wine, tourism, B&B, w&#x2F;e), and your live-in cook breaks a guy’s leg while working for the estate (say, in a case of kitchen negligence, or just plain-old kitchen assault). I come along and propose that maybe you and your other owners should be forced to sell the estate or seriously rework things, since the assault was so bad.In this world, do you share my intuition that at some level the estate itself should be made to answer for the actions of its employees on the job?Beyond just fining corporations for damages, I feel there’s an unaccounted for intuitive sense that corporations should forfeit their autonomy and very existence in light of serious or repeated malfeasance, even if it wasn’t voted on by every member of the board before being enacted.Ok maybe I did have time for a metaphor dance lol. Hope all this was somewhat clear! replyj-bos 12 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t that open and shut fraud on the part of ebay? reply hiatus 11 hours agorootparentHow is that fraud? Ebay is brokering a deal between two parties. It doesn&#x27;t seem inherently fraudulent to offer differing prices to each party. reply arp242 9 hours agorootparentThe deal I make with eBay is \"I sell X for whatever the highest bidder pays, and then pay a percentage of that to Ebay for services rendered\" (10% IIRC). That is: I would get $315 and eBay $35, but instead what happened is that I get $270 and eBay $80.Note that it DIDN&#x27;T list a \"higher price for the buyer\"; people were bidding so that price was correct. What it did was list a LOWER price to the seller.This is like you giving me your guitar and telling me \"Martin, sell it for me and keep 10% of the price for your trouble\" and then I lie to you about the price I sold it for so I can keep the difference.I don&#x27;t know how else to describe this than fraud. This seems wildly illegal in most jurisdictions and I&#x27;m surprised they&#x27;re getting away with it. reply alsetmusic 11 hours agorootparentpreveBay stole my money and made it impossible to get a refund fifteen years ago.

You pay $X to not have to worry about something&#x2F;get a service, but when you’re not paying attention they jack up prices.I looked the other day and it’s like $19&#x2F;month for Spotify Family now… when did that happen? It was like $14 when I signed up. But all my playlists are set up on Spotify… what’s more, all the fam’s are too. Huge PITA to move to Apple Music. reply vineyardmike 20 minutes agorootparentI hate to tell ya, but Spotify will eternally be stuck between unprofitability and price raises.Spotify has to negotiate with record labels who mostly act as a unified block, and they have leverage because Spotify needs all major labels or else customers can’t find all their music. No one is a “interscope” loyalist - they’re loyal to artists. This gives them power to basically demand >100% of the profit margin. That’s why they’re trying to get into other markets like podcasts. Record labels get ~50% of revenue, then Apple&#x2F;Google app stores get 30% from some customers - that doesn’t leave a lot of room for Spotify.That’s also why YouTube music and Apple Music will be the only long term players - but they need Spotify. They can take a loss to keep customers in the ecosystem BUT they need Spotify to always be the first to break to keep rates tolerable. reply gnicholas 10 hours agoparentprev> Finally I lowered the price enough to get it sold.How much did you have to lower the price by?

This is extremely common on AliExpress, and obviously the FTC&#x27;s reach is limited there, but it also happens not infrequently on Amazon and eBay. reply thelastgallon 21 hours agoprevAn excerpt from: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pluralistic.net&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;25&#x2F;greedflation&#x2F;Amazon binds its sellers over to something called Most Favored Nation status. That means that sellers can&#x27;t offer their goods more cheaply than they do on Amazon – even if it costs them (lots) less to sell in Target or direct from their websites. This means that every time a seller adds a dollar to their Amazon sale price, they have to add a dollar to the price of their goods everywhere else, too.After a bunch of state AGs filed lawsuits against Amazon over this, the company promised to cut it out.They lied.A new filing in California&#x27;s suit against Amazon reveals that sellers live \"in constant fear\" of retaliation from Amazon if they allow their goods to be sold more cheaply elsewhere. reply granzymes 17 hours agoparentAccording to the FTC&#x27;s lawsuit, Amazon no longer binds its sellers with a Most Favored Nation clause. Instead, Amazon now will refuse to promote an offer in its \"buy box\" space if it detects a lower price for that good on another website.The FTC alleges that this simply reconstitutes the MFA since most sales on Amazon take place from the buy box. Amazon responds that it is within its rights to not promote uncompetitive offers that make its site look bad for not having the lowest available price. reply londons_explore 15 hours agorootparent> Amazon responds that it is within its rights to not promote uncompetitive offersSounds to me like Amazon has found a loophole in the law. It agrees to list anything for sale, with no anti competitive conditions, but then only recommends customers buy things that it believes are in the customers best interests.The FTC will struggle to argue that is illegal. Amazon can&#x27;t be compelled to recommend stuff. (free speech etc). Also, what they recommend is in the consumers immediate best interests.It will be hard for the court to argue that amazon should start recommending more expensive items to consumers, just to push consumers into looking for a cheaper platform. reply Guvante 12 hours agorootparentSay Amazon offers three items all equivalent: one is priced at $9 and two are priced at $9.50 all are Prime.If the vendor for the $9 offers it for $8.50 elsewhere and Amazon starts focusing on a $9.50 offer is that \"better for the consumer\"?If the $9 doesn&#x27;t exist and there are two vendors at the $9.50 price and one has a higher review history but offers it lower elsewhere is Amazon making things better by focusing on the other one? reply granzymes 11 hours agorootparentThe \"buy box\" is a product-level feature, not a seller-level feature. On any given product page, there may be multiple sellers with offers (one for $9, two for $9.50). The $9 offer would be prominently displayed in the buy box and the other two would be in the \"other offers\" section.If another site starts selling the same product for $8.50 (regardless of who the seller is), Amazon may hide the buy box and put all the offers in the \"other offers\" section to avoid advertising an offer that isn&#x27;t the best price available online.Consumers price compare across sites, and Amazon wants to maintain its reputation for low prices (and in truly egregious cases prevent sellers on Amazon from price gouging). reply Guvante 9 hours agorootparentExcept they do the same for non-new products which muddles things tremendously.If I don&#x27;t see a price I assume it is out or they only have used ones. Certainly occasionally I have seen scalpers when I double checked anyway to see what the price would be if it returned but generally Amazon caught maybe half the scalpers in my experience.Having a signal that means \"you could get it less elsewhere\" be the same signal as \"I only have scalpers\" isn&#x27;t exactly good for consumers.Also this implies that Prime shipping is worthless given they exclude it from the calculation... reply Red_Leaves_Flyy 15 hours agorootparentprevAmazons fees are making the offer uncompetitive thus Amazon is actually not competitive meaning that they’re relying on their monopoly position to maintain market dominance instead of competition which they evidently cannot do. reply granzymes 15 hours agorootparentprev>It will be hard for the court to argue that amazon should start recommending more expensive items to consumers, just to push consumers into looking for a cheaper platform.Yes, 100% this.

It should be recommending the best product for the user at the price it can offer the product at.The fact that the product exists $1 cheaper on another site does not make it not the best recommendation for the customer’s need. If I search “tablet” are you saying I should be recommended a cheap off brand tablet promoted to me because Amazon has the cheapest price or an iPad even though I can buy an iPad on apple.com for $10 cheaper? reply granzymes 13 hours agorootparent>The fact that the product exists $1 cheaper on another site does not make it not the best recommendation for the customer’s need. If I search “tablet” are you saying I should be recommended a cheap off brand tablet promoted to me because Amazon has the cheapest price or an iPad even though I can buy an iPad on apple.com for $10 cheaper?I think you are misunderstanding the issue. Amazon is selectively determining to show the \"buy box\" on a specific product page based on whether the prices for that SKU on Amazon are competitive with prices for the same SKU on other websites.In your example, Amazon might not have a buy box for a given iPad model if the same model was available on apple.com for less. The presence of cheaper non-iPad tablets would not impact the iPad buy box. reply femto113 14 hours agorootparentprevThe insurmountable problem is that the practical interests of \"consumers shopping on Amazon\" don&#x27;t actually align with the abstract interests of \"consumers in general\" that the government is purporting to defend. On Amazon we want to find the right item (search, description, reviews), have strong confidence in the inventory and shipping promises (fulfilled by Amazon) and have reasonable confidence we&#x27;re not getting screwed on price including shipping (Buybox, Prime eligible etc). If you chop those things apart it becomes essentially impossible to offer the overall experience that consumers clearly prefer. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentThe cause of this is that it should be an anti-trust violation for any wholesaler or manufacturer to dictate retail prices to the retailer. They agree on the wholesale price because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re negotiating with one another, then the retailer chooses the retail price in their store.Now if Amazon wants the MFN clause, no problem -- but it&#x27;s the wholesale price they can&#x27;t sell to someone else below, not the retail price. If Amazon wants the lowest retail price, that&#x27;s up to them. reply buffington 11 hours agorootparentprev> what they recommend is in the consumers immediate best interests.How? Amazon routinely recommends products to me that are objectively inferior compared to other products. For example, I just searched for \"peak design travel tripod\" and the number one result, which is also marked with \"Overall Pick\", is a tripod made by a company with the name of KINGJUEEQUESTER that looks like it&#x27;s made out of cardboard tubes, but at least comes with a free 21 piece lens filter set and selfie stick for $18.99. And it has 3000+ 5 star reviews that are almost nearly identical. \"Edward Von McTavish: The KINGJUEEQUESTER tripod arrived. It is of the most impressive quality. The Leg Lock feature fulfills my needs. I recommend for you.\"The thing I&#x27;m actually searching for isn&#x27;t even on the first page of results. It&#x27;s on page two, under \"More Results\" and has a title of \"Peak Design Travel Tripod (Carbon Fiber)\" and is priced at $599.95 (the same price you&#x27;ll find on Peak Design&#x27;s site).How is it that showing me anything other than what I searched for supports me as a consumer? reply piannucci 15 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t studied antitrust policy in ages, but IIRC one aspect of this in the past has been to forbid the monopolist from peeking at their competitors&#x27; prices. reply bcrosby95 13 hours agorootparentprev> Sounds to me like Amazon has found a loophole in the law.No, not necessarily. This is just what companies always do. As long as it looks like they&#x27;re \"trying\" to comply, they don&#x27;t get in big trouble.

I used to work at Amazon (although not on any of these teams) so that&#x27;s probably why I know that \"see all buying options\" means the price is not competitive. As a consumer I value this.Amazon scours the web to make sure their products are competitively priced. So if a Western Digital external hard drive is $99 on NewEgg, then Amazon wants to sell it for $99 or lower. If it&#x27;s a 1P product (i.e., Amazon is the seller), they can easily price match in real time. But if it is a 3P (third party seller) product then Amazon cannot take that action unilaterally take that action since it is the seller setting the price. So the best they can do to protect their customer in real time when their crawlers detect a lower price elsewhere is to hide the buy box behind the \"see all buying options\" button.I&#x27;m sure when this feature was rolled out, Amazon&#x27;s sales must have dropped. They are taking that short term hit in order to protect customer trust in the long term. reply lozenge 13 hours agorootparentHow does an extra click help the customer? Unless the customer used to work at Amazon and specifically knows that \"see all buying options\" means \"scour the internet to find a better price, it should be easy this time\". reply jjk166 11 hours agorootparentThey aren&#x27;t hiding the better priced items behind an extra click, they are hiding the worse priced items. If you buy something listed in the \"see all buying options\" it means that you are spending more than you have to, as you will likely be able to find it for less elsewhere, whereas the normally presented items are the ones Amazon is selling for the same or less than elsewhere. reply helen___keller 16 hours agorootparentprevDoes anyone have examples of popular &#x2F; name brand products that are pushed down in ranking due to this? I would love to see for myself how this looks in practice reply granzymes 16 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s one of the examples that the FTC cites in its complaint (at page 27):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pilot-Retractable-Rollerball-Extra-Re...Compare it to this listing for a very similar product:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Pilot-Retractable-Rollerball-Ultra-0-...You&#x27;ll see that in the FTC&#x27;s example, you need to click to see more buying details and that at the time of this comment the lowest price is $14.28 with free shipping (on October 12th for my location).In the other example, the \"buy box\" highlights the best offer of $9.99 with free shipping (on October 5th for my location). reply AlanYx 16 hours agorootparentThat first example is eye-opening for me. I always thought that when Amazon doesn&#x27;t show a buy button on the product page, it&#x27;s because that product is not currently available to be shipped from Amazon. reply granzymes 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s one possibility! But Amazon also hides the buy box when the only offers are not what Amazon considers \"competitive\" because it hurts their brand if consumers see shitty deals.In this example, the pens with the buy box are 50% cheaper and have much faster shipping. reply AlanYx 15 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re not the same pens though (extra fine v. ultra fine).I can understand why the FTC is concerned. This has the potential to be worse for competition than MFN agreements, because it forces any supplier whose products might end up on Amazon to police its entire distribution network for minimum pricing.* It also forces suppliers to crack down on (legal, authentic) grey market imports, even if those are never sold on Amazon, or risk losing the ability to effectively sell on Amazon.* Moreover, that minimum pricing has to be sufficiently high to account for Amazon&#x27;s cost structure, even if other competing vendors are more efficient. reply granzymes 15 hours agorootparentI was offering the comparison because those two pens should be priced within a few cents of eachother (the difference is the tip width and ironically \"extra fine\" is more expensive). If the products were the same then there would only be one product page and the $9.99 offer would be the highlighted deal.The fact that one product has the buy box at $9.99 and 1-day shipping and the other product does not have the buy box at $14.28 and 8-day shipping lets us infer that $14.28 is not a competitive price for these pens and there may be a cheaper price elsewhere (likely closer to $9.99). reply taeric 15 hours agorootparentYou seem to be thinking that manufacturing costs alone dictate the product cost. Demand and volume in circulation are also part of what determines costs, though. That is, your first assertion that they should be within cents of each other is clearly wrong.It doesn&#x27;t let us infer that there is a cheaper cost somewhere, it lets us infer that Amazon has a low confidence that someone will buy it. That or they have such a low inventory of it that they are not confident showing it on the buy box without more engagement from the users.To be clear, I&#x27;m ok with the idea that this is getting investigated. I have low confidence of finding smoking gun reasons to punish sellers on this. I am far more confident that Amazon is optimizing to convert sales. reply granzymes 15 hours agorootparentActually, in this case I am cheating because I already know that this SKU is offered for a lower price with faster shipping from Walmart. I suspect that listing is what triggered the loss of the buy box. reply taeric 15 hours agorootparentBut that is a non-sequitur. Literally, in that that doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow. We literally don&#x27;t know why the buy box doesn&#x27;t have it here and I could guess at a few other reasons. Most likely, I&#x27;d guess that the cheapest option not being Prime factors in to it more so than external offers being cheaper. reply granzymes 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right, shipping speed likely also factors into it in addition to cost (that&#x27;s why I also mentioned the shipping speed). If Amazon can&#x27;t deliver within its 2-day Prime guarantee it is less likely to promote the offer.Of course, without access to Amazon&#x27;s systems I can&#x27;t say for sure why any individual listing is or is not promoted. I&#x27;m just making an educated guess based on what the FTC put in its complaint. reply taeric 14 hours agorootparentTotally fair, and I think this is the kind of thing they could&#x2F;should make rules around having a good audit mechanism for regulators to check. replyhelen___keller 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks!

Participants and consumers seem to think that these platforms are somehow public spaces that they partially own, or at least they act that way.But you only own what you actually own.There are legal instruments and structures that actually let you partially own things and&#x2F;or grant you rights so you can act on these kinds of expectations: coops, open source and other such licenses etc.When internet culture and commerce wants to mature, then maybe we should start focusing more on building on _legally_ trustworthy foundations. reply fyrn_ 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s nice, but the reality is that Amazon has almost 90% control of e-commerce.

It takes decades of work. reply EGreg 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the thing people don&#x27;t get about making competitors to Facebook, Twitter, and other centralized platforms as well.You don&#x27;t need to boil the ocean in order to serve a single community. For example, Facebook started in Harvard and its value to everyone in Harvard was based on how many people in Harvard used it, not how many people in the world used it.Similarly, if a single product vendor and their customers form a community, then a free market of fulfillment companies can spring up to stock that specific product, and then partner with the delivery companies (who have their own networks) to deliver the package. You might say that the delivery infrastructure is a cartel, but they&#x27;re open to everyone and Amazon has been relying on them until finally spinning out their own. Same goes for CPU chips that Apple relies on etc.Look at IPFS for example, competing with AWS for storage. It is growing every year and now powers 1% of all storage worldwide! And there is a free market.Whereas these platforms are all centrally controlled by some billionaire (Zuck, Musk, Bezos) and his crew. You don&#x27;t need to have their scale because you don&#x27;t need to serve ALL COMMUNITIES IN THE WORLD on day one. If you have an open source software like Wordpress or Magento, you can serve your customers with web hosting instead of Shopify or Amazon. Now the only question is, who would do fulfilment. reply lotsofpulp 18 hours agorootparentYou are correct, but note that one very key edge that Amazon used to as a competitive edge is no longer available to new entrants in the business. For the first 15 to 20 years of Amazon, they were able to be cheaper than their competitors due to the fact that sales tax only had to be collected in states where they had a nexus.This gave them a pricing advantage which drove more customers to them which they intelligently plowed back into the business in building out their own network, no small feat of course.A newer competitor would no longer have access to that simple sales tax advantage, and so would have to find something else to compel customers with. Barring that, Amazon&#x2F;Walmart&#x2F;Costco&#x2F;Target&#x2F;Home Depot&#x2F;Lowes&#x2F;Best Buy are tough to compete with because they already offer rock bottom pricing and they don’t have to invest in a ton of new infrastructure for logistics. reply virgildotcodes 17 hours agorootparentNot to mention the advantage of having investors willing to burn billions for a decade+ until you got into a dominant market position to finally become profitable.

There are many ways of constructively working around MFN requirements but it creates collateral damage. For example, the practice of having very high prices that are steeply discounted for most customers is often an artifact of having the US government as one of your customers. For software, it is common to create a new product&#x2F;service that is trivially different in some way so that you can justify a new SKU that is only sold to the government.Amazon&#x27;s practice is bad because it anchors pricing to their mandated cost structure. That the US government engages in similar practices should at least raise questions, because it has the same effect on the marketplace. reply da_chicken 16 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s several problems with that.It&#x27;s true that the US government does make those demands, but it&#x27;s very important to note that the US government organization is not a reseller of goods. It is almost exclusively a consumer. It is not in direct competition in the same marketplace with private industry outside of a few select industries (e.g., USPS, limited healthcare).Next, MFN tariffs kind of by definition only affect international commerce. For Amazon, a 100% domestic manufacturer producing goods would need to comply.Finally, MFN is something defined by WTO treaty. If you have to abide by MFN when importing goods into the US, it&#x27;s almost certainly because your nation is also a WTO member. Because almost all of them are. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade requires WTO members to extend MFN treatment to like products of other WTO members. It&#x27;s literally the the first article of the treaty agreement.

If the government&#x27;s position is that MFN terms for vendors are fundamentally anti-competitive and bad for consumers, which I agree with, then it raises questions about any organization or sector of the economy that widely requires MFN terms. It discredits the FTC when the US government routinely engages in the same market malpractice that they are accusing Amazon of but are disinterested in changing their own contracting behavior. It doesn&#x27;t become less bad because it is the government doing it to vendors instead of Amazon.This \"rules for thee but not for me\" behavior is why trust in government institutions has been eroding.

Good question! That’s where the scheme gets very clever. Originally, Amazon imposed contracts, as the FTC noted, “barring all sellers from offering their goods for lower prices anywhere else.” But Europeans, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, complained about these price parity agreements, so Amazon dropped its explicit contractual requirements in 2019.> However, this change was a farce. The firm simply did through code what it couldn’t do through contract. \"Amazon,” claims the FTC, “has implemented an algorithm for the express purpose of deterring other online stores from offering lower prices.> Today, Amazon tells sellers that if it detects a lower price for their products on any other online store, they will be punished, which is to say, their ability to get their products onto a place on the Amazon website where customers click will go away.

This is done to keep the cost of, say, luxury goods above a certain value, or to ensure that even if demand falls off for a product, the product is sold from official channels at a price point that covers the raw-materials-plus-labor cost so the manufacturer isn&#x27;t fundamentally selling at a loss. These agreements are generally enforced by both contract and tit-for-tat... Sometimes there are contractually-encoded penalties for going under-MAP, but sometimes the agreement is more \"off the books...\" If Amazon decides those Gucci purses are just taking up warehouse space and slashes their price to clear them, they can do that... If they don&#x27;t want to have any Gucci purses to sell next year through official channels.Why is this behavior legal for manufacturers but maybe not for Amazon? I can see no other reason than the law is path-dependent and arbitrary. \"Fair trade\" is a concept we invent as we go.(Incidentally... As a consumer, it&#x27;s useful to remember MAP exists when you hear whispers of \"don&#x27;t buy from unauthorized resellers.\" Sometimes the goods you get from those channels are shady, but sometimes they&#x27;re exactly the same as the official-goods channels, shoveled into the back channel by an official retailer to clear warehouse space and reported to the manufacturer as &#x27;damaged, lost&#x27; to preserve the MAP kayfabe). reply yjftsjthsd-h 15 hours agorootparent> Why is this behavior legal for manufacturers but maybe not for Amazon?

Consider, we hold pro players to tighter requirements than we do local leagues. They both have basically the same rules, of course, but not fully identical. And enforcement is, of course, largely at the discretion of the agencies enforcing them.The last is obnoxious, if you view the entire field as a homogeneous thing. And I do get the impression that there is something more going on in this case. That said, it is not abnormal to rank ROI on what gets enforced. I wish it was framed directly in those terms, though. reply golemotron 18 hours agorootparentThe US is strong on the doctrine that the law applies equally to people (legal entities) regardless of size &#x2F; market cap.

I said it is enforced on a ranking that is based on ROI. And... it really has to be.There are almost certainly low key levels of bad practices in small shops.

Literally it would be trivial in today&#x27;s world to have a hookup on your car to check your speed against the local signage on a somewhat real time basis. Sounds absurd, but there is a pretty good chance every long haul truck you see out there is doing exactly that.Similarly, mens rea is a thing. Such that statutory enforcement of rules is often a regressive policy that isn&#x27;t necessarily a good idea. reply abduhl 16 hours agorootparentI think most people who have driven on the interstate are quite aware that police arbitrarily pull people over for many things given the vast number of laws that are continuously broken by all drivers. I do not think a regime where you’re always breaking a law and can be pulled over just for driving while black is a good example when advocating for prosecutorial discretion. I’d prefer a system that doesn’t result in being subject to a regulatory action or prosecution because I was doing business while black. reply taeric 16 hours agorootparentAh, agreed. And if you take the worst possible interpretation of my post I can see how you get there.My point was that many rules get enforced on a cost benefit based system. Especially in business where enforcement is necessarily an expensive undertaking. Ideally, part of enforcement will include evolution of the rules so that people don&#x27;t grow into a situation where what they are doing is suddenly illegal. That said, many of the rules we are looking at here are more along the lines of \"you left interstate driving and are now in a city.\" That is, the landscape and situation pretty much has to factor into the rules. Is why you would be an asshole for worrying about the kid&#x27;s lemonade stand down the corner. Any grandstanding on how the rules apply universally is... well, just not useful. reply abduhl 16 hours agorootparentMy interpretation isn’t the worst possible interpretation, it’s the realistic interpretation based on how permitting discretionary application of the law actually works in practice. Your view is fine in theory but fails (and not just fails theoretically - it has failed and continues to fail actually) in practice. Advocating for your theoretical ideal when we know it fails in practice is… well, just not useful. reply taeric 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m largely acknowledging that that is where we are. And not too concerned about that for many rules. But, and I said so in the initial post, expect that more and more will get enforced both as you get bigger, and as we get better at enforcing them.That is to say, I also expect clarification and evolution of the rules during this enforcement action. Such that I would be most happy to have some of these arrangement flat out illegal. That said, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;advice-guidance&#x2F;competition-guidance&#x2F;gui... was linked on Matt Levine&#x27;s email today. And... \"Our company monitors competitors&#x27; ads, and we sometimes offer to match special discounts or sales incentives for consumers. Is this a problem?\" is answered with a no. Such that, this is a tough field to litigate right now.And, what is it you are advocating for? That we only have rules that we can universally enforce? That would require that we know all of the ways that they can be broken from the beginning, so that we can encode those in law. reply nemo44x 17 hours agoparentprevIsn’t this very common among all resellers? For example if you own a hotel and want other websites to sell your availability they will only list you if you don’t list the same availability for less money. They do this in part because people use the service to search for hotels and even they find one they want they go to other places to see if it’s cheaper. reply notatoad 16 hours agorootparentThis is an antitrust lawsuit filed by the FTC, not an accusation of specifically illegal conduct.They&#x27;re not saying amazon committed a crime by doing this, they&#x27;re saying that it&#x27;s evidence of amazon abusing their market position to create a monopoly. \"most favoured nation\" status is legal, creating a monopoly isn&#x27;t. reply jjk166 11 hours agorootparentYou have that backwards. Monopolies are perfectly legal, it is only establishing and maintaining monopolies by improper conduct (ie specific anti-competitive practices) that is illegal. MFNs are not per se anticompetitive, but by the rule of reason they might be under certain circumstances. The FTC would have to prove that this is one such instance where MFNs are illegal conduct. reply endisneigh 21 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t see the problem with this. They don&#x27;t have to sell on Amazon to begin with. Amazon obviously wants their customers to have the best price available. Sellers can just go off Amazon if they don&#x27;t like it. If sellers end up raising the price on other platforms as a result of this rule, then that says more about them than Amazon.Demanding the lowest price does not harm consumers. Overstock, Wayfair, Walmart and others do the same thing. The result is the lowest price for a given product on all sites. This is unquestionably good for consumers.If the price is higher then the fault is simply that of the seller for raising it. All e-commerce sites want the lowest price for their customers. Of course, people don&#x27;t see nuance and just see BigCompany bad. reply brookst 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ll take the charitable interpretation and assume you just don&#x27;t understand the mechanics of the policy.Amazon is saying that sellers cannot offer a fair low price to customers on other platforms if the seller can&#x27;t also offer it on Amazon. This is 1) anticompetitive, 2) anticonsumer, and 3) insane.Consider this test:- Seller buys a crappy LED bulb from China for $0.80- Seller is happy to list the bulb on Walmart, Target, etc, for $2.00. Net of fees and shipping and stuff they make enough money- Amazon charges $3 in fees. Obviously the seller can&#x27;t afford to sell for $2 on Amazon. They sell for $5 instead.- However, now the seller also can&#x27;t sell for $2 on competing sites. Amazon, leveraging its market share, has dictated that the seller must price Amazon&#x27;s fees into pricing on non-Amazon sites, so consumers pay $5 to Target for something the seller would have been happy getting $2 for.This is insane. reply endisneigh 19 hours agorootparentI disagree.Let&#x27;s use your example. The sellers should stop selling that item on Amazon, and sell their light bulb on Walmart, or where-ever. Customers who really need that will go find it at Walmart, or where-ever. This strengthens the competitors to Amazon, which is bad for Amazon and good for the consumer. The consumer also find the lower price that they wanted. Alternatively, they buy the alternate product on Amazon which would be cheaper than the inflated price (per your example). Again, good for the customer. Everyone wins in every scenario except for the seller, which is how Amazon and every wholesaler operates.Suppose the FTC wins this case and sellers can put whatever price on whatever site. Amazon, like any store wants the lowest price. Not to mention there are only some many items you can show on the first page of results. They will find some other reason to remove these sellers and&#x2F;or their items.Now maybe there&#x27;s another case to stop that behavior too. The result is that companies are not obligated to let sellers on their site. That is insane.In summary, there will never be a scenario where Amazon allows sellers to sell the exact same item for more than Amazon&#x27;s competitors, unless the government forces Amazon to let sellers sell whatever on their site. reply kaibee 19 hours agorootparent> Customers who really need that will go find it at Walmart, or where-ever.So here&#x27;s a weird externality. As a decently well off tech-worker, I don&#x27;t care if I&#x27;m paying 5$ or 2$ for lightbulbs, even if I&#x27;m re-lighting my whole house. The seller will sell on Amazon, because it is the largest market and will set their prices on other markets to match Amazon. I&#x27;ll buy on Amazon, because it isn&#x27;t worth my time to check multiple websites to get the best price (especially when SKUs differ and I have multiple other items I&#x27;m buying, etc). And now people who do need to save money, can&#x27;t also find this lightbulb at a cheaper price on competing marketplaces, even if this lightbulb is actually the best quality. reply endisneigh 19 hours agorootparent> And now people who do need to save money, can&#x27;t also find this lightbulb at a cheaper price on competing marketplaces, even if this lightbulb is actually the best qualityIt&#x27;s the opposite of what you&#x27;re saying.

The problem is that one seller on Amazon moving to another platform won&#x27;t change the fact that Amazon has the majority market share. That&#x27;s how market momentum works and it&#x27;s why we have antitrust laws.Even with exorbitant fees, they are still where sellers need to be. And they are using this market share to force sellers into overpricing on other platforms so that they maintain this unfair position. reply jjk166 10 hours agorootparentWalmart is not all-non amazon customers.If Amazon&#x27;s market share is 35%, then the non-amazon customers comprise the other 65% (which, being greater than 50%, constitutes \"most\").Amazon: ($5 selling price - $3 fees - 0.80 COGS) * (100k * 35%) = $42,000Not-Amazon: ($2 selling price - $0 fees - 0.80 COGS) * (100k * 65%) = $78,000If a seller raises prices to match Amazon, they can be undercut elsewhere by those willing to forgo Amazon for the larger overall market share.Amazon is convenient to small sellers in that they offer more customers on a single site than any other, and with limited bandwidth sellers logically want to minimize how many different sites they need to interact with, but charging for convenience is not inherently anticompetitive behavior. Amazon may have abused it&#x27;s position in the particulars of its MFN implementation, but MFNs in general are fine. reply kube-system 10 hours agorootparentThere are two reasons why that 65% number is wildly unrealistic:1. We&#x27;re ignoring fixed costs associated with onboarding with an ecommerce platform. Selling on one website has significantly lower fixed costs than it is to sell on every ecommerce site on the internet minus one. We&#x27;re talking thousands upon thousands of retailers, not a handful.

To list and sell with Amazon, they are charged $12 per unit. To make a profit the company adds and additional $1 per unit. They sell the product on Amazon for $23 per unit.Online retailer Foo also has a store, and provide the same services that Amazon for their online shop at $5 per unit. The online retailer adds a profit of $2 per unit. Total price $17 per unit. Retailer Foo is more $ efficient for those services as a result customers price compare. Foo is rewarded for their effi with higher volume, manufacturer is rewarded with higher profit and consumer is rewarded with lower prices. Enforcing market competition led to all 3 parties involved being rewarded. Retailer Foo over time grows a larger customer base as people learn to price compare with them and forces Amazon to stop rent seeking.But the above doesn&#x27;t happen in the real world. Amazon enforces that the retailer lower their price on Amazon to $17, while still collecting $12 per unit. The company now can sell on foo, but only by selling on Amazon at a loss. They can&#x27;t afford that amount of loss from Amazon and stay in business. So Amazon avoids competition. They can&#x27;t pull their product from Amazon because not enough customers vist Foo retailer yet to make up the volume.So in the end Foo retailer is more dollar efficient, but is prevented from growing and benefiting the marketplace. Amazon leverages its outside market size to avoid competition. Market participants preventing competition is against the benefits of capitalism and harms the consumer. So, it benefits the consumer to ensure Amazon has to actually compete with the more efficient competitor and stop rent selling behavior. reply rlpb 19 hours agorootparentprev> They will find some other reason to remove these sellers.That&#x27;s be much harder work, though, so regulation might well still have the intended effect.Either their reason will need to be through their seller terms and conditions, or it&#x27;ll have to be done on an individual seller basis.Amazon relies on scale, and therefore standard terms and conditions for all sellers that can be scrutinized by regulators.If it&#x27;s done on an individual seller basis, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll be able to do it while having the same effect in practice. reply adolph 18 hours agorootparentprev> They will find some other reason to remove these sellers.I think this speaks to the nut of the problem.

They specifically show cases where Amazon copied sizes:> Among the victims of the strategy: a popular shirt brand in India, John Miller, which is owned by a company whose chief executive is Kishore Biyani, known as the country&#x27;s \"retail king.\" Amazon decided to \"follow the measurements of\" John Miller shirts down to the neck circumference and sleeve length, the document states. reply jhbadger 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, for historical accuracy, Roku was first in regard to streaming devices you hooked up to your TV. Apple and the rest copied them. And it is pretty much obvious that Microsoft copied Apple (and yes, you can argue that Apple in turn copied PARC). But what makes Amazon copying things different is that they are a marketplace for other people&#x27;s products and a maker of products themselves. That has an intrinsic conflict of interest. reply scarface_74 15 hours agorootparentThe first AppleTV was released in 2007.

That&#x27;s how e-commerce works. Why should Amazon be obligated to fill their store with higher priced items compared to their competitors? No one is going to visit a store where every item could be purchased cheaper somewhere else. This is exactly why price match is a thing, because they don&#x27;t want their costumers soliciting different stores to begin with.The move that Amazon&#x27;s price be no higher than offered elsewhere is the most pro-consumer move possible. Hilarious people are complaining about it. Any second-order effects of this are on the actual seller, not Amazon. reply kibwen 20 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t even know where to begin with this comment. Do you know what anticompetitive behavior is? Do you know how markets are supposed to work? Amazon is leveraging their position in the market to unfairly disadvantage their competitors, thereby distorting the market, decreasing its efficiency, and increasing end prices for consumers everywhere. Market-distorting behavior like this is why antitrust regulation is necessary to keep markets functioning efficiently. reply endisneigh 20 hours agorootparentEverything you&#x27;re stating is false. Amazon is trying to do right by its customers, and they are not obligated to let sellers not give their customers the best price available. Sellers are not obligated to sell on Amazon.Your conclusion that this increases end pries for consumers has nothing to do with Amazon, but the sellers themselves. reply ToValueFunfetti 20 hours agorootparentAmazon was already told not to do this for anti-trust reasons, and they promised to oblige. Unless the government, Amazon, and the general public are all incorrect about what constitutes monopolistic behavior, you are. The idea that Amazon is openly defying pro-consumer laws to do right by its customers is absurd. reply EliRivers 19 hours agorootparentprevThe move that Amazon&#x27;s price be no higher than offered elsewhere is the most pro-consumer move possible.Yet here we are with sellers WANTING to sell their items at a lower price on places other than Amazon, but if they do, they&#x27;ll go out of business. That doesn&#x27;t sound pro-consumer.I&#x27;m a consumer. I&#x27;d like to be able to buy items for the lowest price the seller wants to offer me. That&#x27;s not happening in some cases because if they do, Amazon will exclude them and they&#x27;ll go out of business. Yeah, definitely not pro-consumer. Pro-amazon, sure. reply RandomLensman 18 hours agorootparentWould Amazon be obligated to list the items regardless? Otherwise just dropping pricing conditions would only help those sellers that Amazon has enough interest to list regardless - for some products the \"equilibrium\" might not be great. reply woooooo 20 hours agorootparentprevSome would say that the way commerce works is sellers can sell anywhere at any price that a buyer wants to pay. reply endisneigh 20 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not how commerce works. Commerce works by following the rules of places that you are trying to sell at. You can&#x27;t sell anything anywhere. reply woooooo 20 hours agorootparentSure. The rules at the place you&#x27;re trying to sell.Dictating how you sell elsewhere is a clear step beyond that. reply endisneigh 20 hours agorootparentThey are not dictating how they sell elsewhere. They are saying they need to offer the best price on their site. It is easy to detect whether or not they actually are, and sellers are simply being called out.There is no obligation to sell on Amazon, nor a requirement for them to raise prices on other platforms. They could simply offer the lowest price everywhere. The result? Lower prices for Amazon customers. If they raise the price, then that&#x27;s the seller&#x27;s fault, not Amazon. reply OGWhales 18 hours agorootparent> There is no obligation to sell on AmazonWhile true, this ignores the important point that Amazon is only able to do this anti-competitive practice due to their market dominance that effectively forces many sellers to sell on Amazon.> nor a requirement for them to raise prices on other platforms.That is what this whole thing is about. Sellers that sell on Amazon aren&#x27;t allowed to sell for lower prices on other platforms that are cheaper to sell on.If Amazon was able to offer lower prices for its customers by offering sellers a marketplace with lower costs compared to competitors that would be great. Instead, they abuse their market dominance to prevent any competitors from offering lower prices by being more cost efficient for sellers. This is extremely nasty as it effectively prevents any competitors to Amazon from building a market share since consumers will have no price incentive to switch and sellers will not want to switch due to the smaller market share on those competitors&#x27; platforms.It could not be more clear that this is anti-competitive behavior achieved through abuse of a dominate market position. reply sb8244 19 hours agorootparentprevYou...understand how you can&#x27;t have one without the other, right? reply ARussell 20 hours agorootparentprevAnd Amazon needs to follow the rules and laws of the place that IT&#x27;S trying to sell at. reply endisneigh 20 hours agorootparentAnd which law dictates a company must allow people or sellers on its platform? reply ARussell 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not GP. I didn&#x27;t make that argument. I agree that Amazon is not obliged to allow just anyone on their platform. Sellers must abide by the rules that Amazon sets in place. At the same time, Amazon must abide by the laws of the locations at which it wants to sell. So if a state says that they cannot force a seller to keep their lowest price on Amazon, then that&#x27;s the way it is. reply endisneigh 20 hours agorootparent> So if a state says that they cannot force a seller to keep their lowest price on Amazon, then that&#x27;s the way it is.Yes, but at the end of the day Amazon to remove the seller for any reason, so even if the FTC succeeds here, Amazon will simply purge those sellers who are not offering the best price, even if not explicitly stated.There is no reality where Amazon allows their site to be inundated with higher priced goods compared to competitors. reply ARussell 20 hours agorootparentPerhaps you are right, and",
    "originSummary": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 states have launched an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of monopolization and unfair competition primarily because of its Prime membership program.",
      "The allegations put forth in the lawsuit include the high fees charged to third-party sellers leading to increased consumer prices, discouraging sellers from offering cheaper prices on other platforms, and deteriorating the user experience.",
      "If the suit is successful, it could result in lower prices, heightened competition, and possible remedies like putting an end to anti-discounting measures or splitting up Amazon. The complaint also brings up the secretive nature of antitrust courts and Amazon’s document destruction."

I guess I expected it to be very fast because of the relative simplicity. Forgive me, I know nothing about Godot or Unity. This is still very cool. reply Tiberium 19 hours agoparentGodot packs the whole engine runtime when packing the game no matter the platform, but in this case it&#x27;s also probably because the internet connection on the server is slow - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lfgslots.com&#x2F;classicvideopoker&#x2F;index.wasm (26MB, main engine runtime) took me 22s to load, and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lfgslots.com&#x2F;classicvideopoker&#x2F;index.pck (16MB, game resources) 34s. reply sinuhe69 17 hours agorootparentMust be the bandwidth to the server.

Looks like the management is pretty disconnected and desperate to me. reply akudha 17 hours agoparentprevI have no clue about game development, apologies for the basic question. When does one use Unreal and when does one use Godot? Or does it not matter? reply tetha 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d summarize it as: The Unreal Engine, especially in the 3D realm, gives you a far higher ceiling of possibilities, but it requires a lot more work and effort to use it. Godot, Unity, GameMaker, RPG Maker, RenPy and many more limit your options, but also need less work to get something going.If you have 1-10 people trying to make something cool, you&#x27;d never reach for the Unreal Engine because it is just so much stuff to lift and juggle. If you&#x27;re a large AAA studio looking to make Fallout 5 though... Godot might end up a bit limiting. reply akudha 16 hours agorootparentThank you, this gives me some idea reply HideousKojima 20 hours agoparentprevIf you&#x27;re using C# instead of GDScript you can use Visual Studio (or VS Code or Rider) and get access to all the debugging tools available in those IDEs.

I considered Godot but found it simpler to do everything in client-side JS.Zim&#x27;s web site is definitely a bit \"out there\" but the animation features are quite good and it allowed me, a terrible artist, to program my game quickly and add a lot of visual flair -- dealing the cards, the dealer checking for blackjack, chips sliding, the bouncy result status, etc. reply WA 14 hours agoparentFun game, but I might have encountered a bug.

Is this being played at any casinos yet? I&#x27;m curious how you sell them on the house advantage being real (e.g. a white paper, or some kind of insurance guarantees?).One thing your game could use is a \"repeat bet\" button. reply andy800 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a big \"repeat bet\" button following every hand.Casinos and regulators require a game&#x27;s house advantage to be \"certified\" by one of two specific third-parties. A big expense (both cost and time) when I am sufficiently qualified to calculate the long-term house advantage of the game (and spent lots of hours tweaking the rules and running models to reach a very specific result goal), but no way around it if you want to be in a b-and-m casino. reply mplewis 16 hours agoprevThanks for sharing!

How much time would it take me to start creating non-trivial content and be able to charge for my work? reply MattRix 19 hours agoparentI’m not OP but I’ve been doing game dev for 15 years professionally for the same reasons you mentioned. I’ll be honest up front though, it’s not a great field if you’re going into it trying to make money, but it can be incredibly satisfying.As far as how long it’ll take, that depends on what kind of things you want to make and how much time&#x2F;effort you’re willing to put into them, especially on the visual polish side of things.The hardest part of learning game dev is learning how to program, and it sounds like you already have a good foundation there. The current tools, especially Unity and Godot, are very quick to get up and running with. You could learn the basics in a dozen hours, and be making (bad) games in less than a month. Game design is a skill that is hard to learn except by doing it. Reading books and watching youtube videos about it only goes so far.For making games that you can actually sell, you’re looking at spending months per game, usually at least 6 months… though often the games you think are going to take 6 months often take much longer!The number one tip I would give is to actually finish your games, even your little early experiments. In game dev the “last 10%” takes way more than 10% of the effort. reply opyate 19 hours agoparentprev> non-trivial contentYou mention \"3D animation\" and \"game design\" as areas of focus.For the former, there are established learning paths, so perhaps quite easy to estimate when you&#x27;ll get to a point where you&#x27;re delivering industry-standard work.For the latter (game design), perhaps the answer is a bit different. If you study game design at, say, university, the learning path might be a combination of reflective practice (studying games, writing critically&#x2F;analytically about them), prototyping, making a bunch of games (including the final major project), and doing lots of experimentation (and maybe also going deep into a particular unexplored game mechanic, world building, character design, etc).Even if you finish university, you&#x27;ll still have to make plenty of games to hone your craft.And the, for both of these areas of focus, to actually stand out from the crowd, would require something special. Maybe innate talent, maybe a new way of seeing the world. This is difficult to estimate.(But perhaps you&#x27;ve been sculpting 3D models and making small games in your spare time anyway, and maybe you&#x27;re already quite good, so who knows? :)> charge for my workYou&#x27;re competing with a lot of other people for gamedev work :-) Most gamedev programming jobs don&#x27;t pay as well as other programming jobs. You&#x27;ll be doing it for the love of it!Someone I know worked at a gym, but made games in Unreal in their spare time, then did a 2-years remote masters in indie game dev, and got a job as a technical artist at a small indie studio. AFAIK he still just uses blueprints. I don&#x27;t know how long he spent before university working on games in his spare time, but the 2 years of fast-tracking his knowledge really helped. reply jonny_eh 17 hours agoparentprevIf you want to combine your interest in programming and visual creativity, but still make money, may I suggest front-end development?

Please make your games supportable in Linux(or Proton) as well if your game ships natively. reply dolmen 20 hours agoparentIt works in your browser. Why do you need more platforms support? reply extraduder_ire 19 hours agoparentprevIf you extract the (I think) data.pck file, you can run it with the normal godot engine wherever it&#x27;s supported. (as long as there&#x27;s no missing features the game uses on that platform.) It&#x27;d be easier for the developer to do it, but anyone can theoretically. reply tetha 22 hours agoprevYeah, applying some realization about learning instruments, I&#x27;m currently more or less forcing me to just do stuff in Godot. More focus on doing and learning, less focus on the result.It&#x27;s part struggle with other programming mindsets I have from backend servers for game and other web applications - \"Oh, just shove all data into this system\" is a valid answer, and \"really, really just do what you need right now\" is a good idea.And having implemented some of this on straight up SDL, it&#x27;s pretty impressive how something that would cost you like 1-2 days to make fall down to... 10 minutes of clicking around in a tileset editor. reply matsemann 22 hours agoparentI have a hard time actually making games. Not in Unity or Godot specifically, but games in general. I end up going down rabbit holes in the infinite. Like, I was making a puzzle game, where you need to move pieces in a way to move from A to B. I ended up theming it as crossing a river where A and B are on different sides. I think I&#x27;ve spent 95% of my effort on that game on writing a water shader with the look and feel I&#x27;d like. But it&#x27;s inconsequential to the actual gameplay. I could have just copied some code online or bought an asset and moved on.But at the same time, I&#x27;m enjoying myself. I like learning this stuff, and perhaps my goal is really to have fun rather than actually ship something. So it&#x27;s OK. reply tetha 19 hours agorootparentIMO it all depends on the goal. If you&#x27;re just noodling around on the guitar to have some fun, you&#x27;re not strictly trying to pick better. If you&#x27;re doing picking exercises, you&#x27;re not exploring what a new pedal can do. If you&#x27;re exploring a pedal, you&#x27;re not trying to learn a specific song.For example, I&#x27;m currently deliberately moving slower in an idea to figure out good ways of doing things in Godot as well as reading a lot about thes systems. And I&#x27;ve learned a few things along the way. However, if I was in a Ludum Dare mode of working, I could&#x27;ve had something doing the same things I have now much, much faster, because if you don&#x27;t have core game mechanics working in 8 - 12 hours you&#x27;re utterly doomed in that context. reply yard2010 21 hours agorootparentprevThis is art.

    "commentBody": "Pixel 8 ProHacker NewspastloginPixel 8 Pro (store.google.com) 425 points by alphabetting 18 hours ago| hidepastfavorite690 comments kimbernator 14 hours agoIt&#x27;s starting to feel silly, having a yearly release cycle for smartphones. So much of this product page is focused on new software functions that may have some vague relationship with the slightly upgraded hardware, but that could mostly be released to existing phones. Every new iPhone, Pixel, or Samsung phone basically claims the camera is marginally better and hey, look at these software features that have very little to do with the hardware and should not fundamentally be a reason to upgrade to this phone.There is so much time, effort, and physical waste that is generated by slightly redesigning phones every year purely for the sake of making sales (as opposed to meaningful improvement upon the existing design or introduction of a new hardware feature). Think not only of people upgrading for the sake of it, but all of the cases, screen protectors, and other assorted accessories cast in plastic for previous models that are garbage now.It would be nice if we could just space these things out to 5 years or so now, because that&#x27;s probably how long it takes for anything to change enough to justify a new model. reply TaylorAlexander 13 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s funny because if they did not release a new phone every year, the old phones would be useful for longer. I recently had to replace my iPhone 7s plus because it was getting so slow I sometimes could not get the camera to open as it loaded the system down too much. This was despite the fact that the system said my battery was not degraded (it had been replaced with Apple Care a couple of times).Of course when it was new the camera opened quickly. And then Apple made their OS more heavy weight every year until my phone slowed to a crawl.And faster phones are nice, but I think it is worth considering how valuable that really is to us as users and a society, especially if the process involves making loads and loads of ewaste and consuming tons of new resources, and all the emissions their mining and transport involves, when we could simply keep our software slim and our old devices functional.And the big companies will never do this. Do we need to force them to allow open software to run on these devices, so that clean builds can be patched and maintained when the company over bloats them or abandons them? reply vel0city 12 hours agorootparentI wonder how much of that is the software demands increasing and the flash storage itself wearing out over time. As flash storage wears it&#x27;ll often go slower and slower as the error correction needs to process more to actually get you the uncorrupted bits. This is why a lot of cheap devices tend to just become unbearably slow after a while, their storage just gets to be way too slow.Flash storage doesn&#x27;t last forever, and it&#x27;s got a whole gradient of failure and wear experiences. reply codethief 6 minutes agorootparentInteresting, finally I have an idea of why my phones have always gotten slower over time. Is there a way to measure error rates and&#x2F;or average storage latency on my (Android) phone somehow? reply chimeracoder 12 hours agorootparentprev> I wonder how much of that is the software demands increasing and the flash storage itself wearing out over time.

This is why a lot of cheap devices tend to just become unbearably slow after a while, their storage just gets to be way too slow.Too bad no flagship phones have removable storage anymore, because that would be a really easy fix to this problem. reply vel0city 11 hours agorootparentIf we&#x27;re looking at older phones with removable storage, it usually limited what could be put on the SD card. And in the end the OS and system libraries were still on the on-board storage which would wear out over the years.And there&#x27;s good reason for the OS not being on a microSD card. Run a Raspberry Pi without locking the storage and see how fast it&#x27;ll corrupt itself. Most SD cards have pretty miserable reliability compared to the storage on-board. Imagine if you had to re-image your device every few weeks after your storage device corrupted itself again. Not really a great experience. reply ethbr1 10 hours agorootparentWith cloud backup... this isn&#x27;t as defensible as it used to be.Today, Apple&#x2F;Google could design a phone with (a) a user-replacable battery & (b) no flash, only RAM + removable SD storage + long-life EEPROM.Boot loader, SD validator, and minimal image retrieval goes in EEPROM. Storage contents continually backed up, encrypted, to cloud with delta updates. Customer prompted to replace SD card and device reimagined whenever there&#x27;s an issue.Apple&#x2F;Google sell cloud storage subscriptions.Aka the cockroach phone.That they aren&#x27;t even interested in that model is because they&#x27;re in a Faustian bargain with cellular carriers to drive device renewals and post-paid plans.And integrated batteries and flash memory happen to be a convenient \"Oh well, we can&#x27;t possibly design it any other way\" excuse. reply admax88qqq 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s honestly not a good user experience. Having to buy a new sd card routinely, and better hope you system can detect impending as card failures accurately.Compared to 5 years of good on board storage performance, with no little bits to accidentally lose. And a gradually degradation of performance after that.They could possibly design a phone the way you outlined, but people won&#x27;t buy it. reply eropple 8 hours agorootparentI think most people don&#x27;t realize how slow SD cards are compared to conventional flash, too. When you put apps on a SD card on Android, it&#x27;s always been dog slow. And you&#x27;re at the mercy of the manufacturer to put a reasonably high-speed interface on it.There are options; NVMe and CFExpress cards exist.

I&#x27;d be hard pressed to think of a generational release of an existing phone line in the last 5 years that I would describe as a \"significant\" improvement.The things you listed (camera and chip speed) are basically the only things left that these companies can claim is better than last year&#x27;s model, but only because it&#x27;s so easy to use synthetic benchmarks and numbers that mean nothing to make them sound like a dramatic improvement despite the fact that we&#x27;ve reached the bottom of the barrel in terms of diminishing returns on the user experience for smartphones in their current form. More megapixels don&#x27;t matter anymore, CPUs are hardly a limiting factor and yearly gains on their performance are marginal at best, and we have more than enough RAM for pretty much all use cases.My point is that if these companies insist on re-releasing the same phone every time, maybe they could space it out a little. reply dghlsakjg 8 hours agorootparentDepends on your use case.For me, the addition of satelite SOS introduced on iPhone 14 is a game changer. I do enough out of cell range activity that I carry a SPOT device.The ability for one more device (and pricy subscription) to be eaten by my phone is fantastic.For others it might be onboard ai capabilities.Each incremental hardware update to an iPhone tips the utility scales for someone, and is a completely ignorable change for others. Some people don’t care a bit that the new iPhone has a 2k nit brightness, for others, that is the feature they’ve been waiting for to upgrade.I don’t pay attention to androids much, but it is pretty rare for iPhone full number bumps not to have a hardware feature that is new. reply light_hue_1 0 minutes agorootparentYeah. Don&#x27;t do that.This is not a replacement for a SPOT device. It&#x27;s a backup.

People on average change their phones every 3 years, where the accumulated small improvements do add up. But everyone is at a different point in the cycle, so it absolutely makes sense. Add to it how apple devices hold their value to an insane degree, often living 2nd-3rd lives, and one would be really hard-pressed to actually pinpoint apple as a threat against our planet - compared to cheap androids that are barely good for a single year due to instantly obsolete software, has no resale value whatsoever, and are absolutely single-use.I am not a proponent of extreme capitalism&#x2F;libertarianism, but I really have a hard time with a realistic business model that would be significantly better. reply jonplackett 11 hours agorootparentIf Apple just let people hang out on the last nicely-working version of iOS, where their camera still opens fast, then that’d be fine.

However, I do find that a lot of people I know tend to get new phones well before they actually have a need for them.I don&#x27;t entirely blame peoples&#x27; consumerism; As somebody who once worked in cell phone sales, the mere act of visiting a carrier store is likely to land you in front of a salesperson who is incentivized to sell new phones and lines indiscriminately. Not to mention the incredible amount of advertising that goes into phones - if people only upgraded when they needed new phones, I don&#x27;t think Apple, Samsung, or Google would feel the need to advertise the new ones so aggressively.HN is likely a much more tech-literate crowd than the average person, so I think to a lot of us it seems silly to buy new phones every year. But I know that every time Apple releases a new iPhone, I get a call from my dad asking if it&#x27;s worth upgrading from last year&#x27;s model. I say no, nothing has changed, but the next time I see him he has it. Why? Because the salesperson made such a convincing case, not only about the merit of the new phone, but the fact that they could give him such a \"deal\" on it. reply kaba0 12 hours agorootparent> lot of people I know tend to get new phones well before they actually have a need for themIt might just be your “bubble”, but even if not, is it really that bad of a deal? If you resell your previous phone at 2&#x2F;3 the original price each year, you can use the latest phone for like 200 bucks for a year, or $17 monthly. For a device that is with you 0-24, and is probably the most often used item a typical person owns — they have it on them more often than even their shoes! reply kimbernator 11 hours agorootparentI feel qualified to say it&#x27;s not just my bubble, having worked in cell phone sales. The business hinges on the fact that people don&#x27;t run out the useful life of their devices.Incentives exist on the part of the person who, being human, definitely want the new shiny thing, regardless of the logic behind it.They exist for the salesperson, who will get a commission for selling the new shiny thing, regardless of whether this makes the customer&#x27;s life any better or worse.They exist for the carrier because the customer is on the hook for 2-3 years of service when they buy the shiny thing.Finally, they exist for the company that made the phone because they make a profit on the sale price of the shiny thing. reply kaba0 3 hours agorootparentHistorically? Sure. But we are no longer in that phase of the mobile industry that a year old phone is close to useless at running new apps - the hardware improvements are more gradual. reply bruceb 11 hours agorootparentprevMath doesn&#x27;t work.

For no sane reason.Somewhere along the way, you pass a threshold where it&#x27;s uncool to have a certain version of phone and judging from what you hear about the waste problem with phones, it&#x27;s above the reasonable moment to get rid of it because it&#x27;s broken or not usable.I mean, sure it&#x27;s a nice lie you can tell to yourself, but in the end, it&#x27;s not good. reply TeMPOraL 9 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not always about being uncool. Sometimes it&#x27;s about your current device getting slow enough to be annoying, so you want to replace to avoid paying the daily mental tax, \"death through thousand papercuts\", coming from the single piece of electronics you use most of, day in, day out. And that is caused mostly by software bloat - as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, between OS updates and app updates, a year is about how long a flagship phone has before it starts to become annoying to use. And then it only gets worse. reply Gigachad 11 hours agorootparentprevApple has a few products like the ipad mini and imac that don&#x27;t release on yearly schedules and it creates this situation where there are good and bad years to buy.

I find upgrading less frequently makes the upgrade so much more significant. Upgrading yearly would leave you complaining and wondering what&#x27;s new.I know people who lease a new car every 3 years.

Whereas, I upgrade my car every 10 years, and am thrilled with all the improvements. reply pfannkuchen 13 hours agorootparentI think the lease thing is more to avoid dealing with any maintenance issues as well as the wear and tear on a less than new car.

Though in terms of physical waste that the original commenter brought up, selling your old phone for someone else to use makes that upgrade a pretty good option.We could look at the total amount of years any phone is used and abstract away from who uses it.

We didn&#x27;t even know until I checked, her phone is the iPhone X which was released 6 years ago and technically nothing is stopping her from using it longer except the lack of desire to prune her message history&#x2F;photos&#x2F;vids.My wife is someone who&#x27;s not going to suffer with a poorly functioning piece of technology nor someone who is going to work hard to optimize it or prolong its life, so the fact that her 6 year old phone works just fine is a good sign that it can, in the average case. reply throwawake 6 hours agorootparentAs another data point, I&#x27;ve a tendency to not store too many photos and messages for long term.

The only reason I&#x27;ll upgrade will be 5G. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentI do that too, recently for the first time enabled cloud sync (had a 1 TB of OneDrive storage sitting unused anyway), so most photos delete themselves from the phone eventually. But that&#x27;s compensating for tech deficiency, though.What is the point of me having 256 GB of storage on the phone, if the phone starts slowing down wholesale once I take 50% of it? I get that there needs to be some buffer for swap and flash magic and whatnot, but I&#x27;d thought it would be closer to PC &#x2F; Windows, where everything is fine until ~90% storage being used.That&#x27;s on top of bloated software doing background magic. Can&#x27;t speak for other phones and brands, but my experience with Samsung flagships (S4, S7, wife&#x27;s S9, now S22) is that the camera and gallery app are bloated, and their performance degrades rapidly with the amount of photos you take - around 50% worth of storage is when camera starts having delays on the order of seconds, interfering with its core purpose of taking photos.(And it&#x27;s not that it couldn&#x27;t be better - Samsung just isn&#x27;t investing effort in making core system apps performant enough. It&#x27;s hard to find efficient apps these days on the Play Store, but there are rare exceptions, like e.g. Aves gallery, which is FLOSS and manages to be leaner, faster and significantly more feature-full than just about anything else, stock or third-party.) reply bradgessler 8 hours agorootparentprevI upgrade once every 2-3 years on average and my quality of life is great.

Just because a new phone is released every year, it doesn&#x27;t mean you need to buy a new one every year.Small, incremental improvements each year means that whenever you buy a new device, it&#x27;s modern (not using 4 year old components), and substantially &#x27;better&#x27; than the previous one. reply tshaddox 10 hours agoparentprevI think it&#x27;s more likely that if they spaced the releases out to every 5 years, there would just be a 5x reduction in the pace of changes, and you could issue the same complaint \"Why do they release every 5 years when hardly anything changes?\"It&#x27;s not like the incremental physical changes just automatically happen independently of designing, mass manufacturing, and releasing new phone models.

All of that for ~7 years means a really fantastic user experience and a massive community of people that have collectively worked through solutions to common problems and forced the company&#x27;s hand on defects (joycon drift, for example).

BRIEF BIOGRAPHY OF PYTHAGORAS The Greek mathematician Pythagoras has high name recognition, not only in the history of mathematics. Everyone who has studied geometry can recall, well after the high school years, some aspect of the Pythagorean Theorem. However, the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem is not well known. Some story plot points are: the famous theorem goes by several names grounded in the behavior of the day (discussed later in the text), including the Pythagorean Theorem, Pythagoras’ Theorem and notably Euclid I 47. The Pythagorean Theorem is arguably the most famous statement in mathematics, and the fourth most beautiful equation.1, 2 There are well over 371 Pythagorean Theorem proofs originally collected by an eccentric mathematics teacher, who put them in a 1927 book, which includes those by a 12-year-old Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci (a master of all disciplines) and President of the United States James A. Garfield.3, 4, 5 Pythagoras’ likeness in pictures and sculptures, as shown in Figure 1, appears in all geometry textbooks, and books about the history of mathematics. However, ironically, not much is really known about him – not even his likeness. What is known about Pythagoras is generally considered more fiction than fact, as historians who lived hundreds of years later provided the facts about his life. There are definite details of Pythagoras’ life from early biographies that use original sources, yet are written by authors who attribute divine powers to him, and present him as a deity figure. Consequently, most historians treat this information as legend. Few historians view the information with any degree of historical importance because it is obtained from rare original sources.6 Figure 1 Pythagoras. Full size image Historians generally agree that Pythagoras of Samos (born circa 569 BC in Samos, Ionia and died circa 475 BC) was the first mathematician. He is an extremely important figure in the development of mathematics, yet relatively little is known about his mathematical achievements. Unlike many later Greek mathematicians, who wrote a number of books, there are no writings by Pythagoras. However, there is evidence that Pythagoras founded a school (in what is now Crotone, to the east of the heel of southern Italy) named the Semicircle of Pythagoras – half-religious and half-scientific, which followed a code of secrecy. Because secrecy is often controversial, Pythagoras is a mysterious figure. The members of the Semicircle of Pythagoras – the Pythagoreans – were bound by an allegiance that was strictly enforced. However, the Semicircle was more than just a school that studied intellectual disciplines, including in particular philosophy, mathematics and astronomy.7 The scientific dimension of the school treated numbers in ways similar to the Jewish mysticism of Kaballah, where each number has divine meaning and combined numbers reveal the mystical worth of life. The latter is reflected in the Pythagorean motto: Number Rules the Universe.6 The religious dimension of the school included diverse lectures held by Pythagoras attended by men and women, even though the law in those days forbade women from being in the company of men. Pythagoreans consumed vegetarian dried and condensed food and unleavened bread (as matzos, used by the Biblical Jewish priestly class (the Kohanim), and used today during the Jewish holiday of Passover).8 One reason for the rarity of Pythagoras original sources was that Pythagorean knowledge was passed on from one generation to the next by word of mouth, as writing material was scarce. Moreover, out of respect for their leader, many of the discoveries made by the Pythagoreans were attributed to Pythagoras himself; this would account for the term ‘Pythagoras’ Theorem’. Consequently, of Pythagoras’ actual work nothing is known. On the other hand, his school practiced collectivism, making it hard to distinguish between the work of Pythagoras and that of his followers; this would account for the term ‘Pythagorean Theorem’. Therefore, the true discovery of a particular Pythagorean result may never be known. Regardless of the uncertainty of Pythagoras’ actual contributions, however, his school made outstanding contributions to mathematics. Is seems that Pythagoras was the first person to define the consonant acoustic relationships between strings of proportional lengths. Specifically, strings of equal tension of proportional lengths create tones of proportional frequencies when plucked. For example, a string that is 2 feet long will vibrate x times per second (that is, hertz, a unit of frequency equal to one cycle per second), while a string that is 1 foot long will vibrate twice as fast: 2x. Furthermore, those two frequencies create a perfect octave.9 The most important discovery of Pythagoras’ school was the fact that the diagonal of a square is not a rational multiple of its side.10 This result proved the existence of irrational numbers.11 This finding greatly disturbed the Pythagoreans, as it was inconsistent with their divine belief in numbers: whole numbers and their ratios, which account for geometrical properties, were challenged by their own result. The Pythagoreans were so troubled over the finding of irrational numbers that they swore each other to secrecy about its existence. It is known that one Pythagorean did tell someone outside the school, and he was never to be found thereafter, that is, he was murdered, as Pythagoras himself was murdered by oppressors of the Semicircle of Pythagoras.12 THE BABYLONIANS Babylonia was situated in an area known as Mesopotamia (Greek for ‘between the rivers’). Mesopotamia (arrow 1 in Figure 2) was in the Near East in roughly the same geographical position as modern Iraq.13 Two great rivers flowed through this land: the Tigris and the Euphrates (arrows 2 and 3, respectively, in Figure 2). Mesopotamia was one of the great civilizations of antiquity, rising to prominence 4000 years ago. Thousands of clay tablets, found over the past two centuries, confirm a people who kept accurate records of astronomical events, and who excelled in the arts and literature. Only a small fraction of this vast archeological treasure trove has been studied by scholars. The great majority of tablets lie in the basements of museums around the world, awaiting their turn to be deciphered and to provide a glimpse into the daily life of ancient Babylon.14 Figure 2 Ancient Near East Empires around 1350 BC(Egypt, Babylon, Mitanni, Hittite, Assyria, plus Route of Abraham). Full size image Among the tablets that have received special scrutiny is that with the identification ‘YBC 7289’, shown in Figure 3, which represents the tablet numbered 7289 in the Babylonian Collection of Yale University.15 The tablet dates from the Old Babylonian period, roughly 1800–1600 BCE, and shows a tilted square and its two diagonals, with some marks engraved along one side and under the horizontal diagonal. The marks are in wedge-shaped characters, carved with a stylus into a piece of soft clay that was then dried in the sun or baked in an oven. They turn out to be numbers, written in the Babylonian numeration system that used the base 60. In this sexagestimal system, numbers up to 59 were written in essentially the modern base-10 numeration system, but without a zero. Units were written as vertical Y-shaped notches, while tens were marked with similar notches written horizontally.15 Figure 3 YBC 7289. Full size image A fortuitous event: the find of tablet YBC 7289 was translated by Dennis Ramsey and dating to YBC 7289, circa 1900 BC: 4 is the length and 5 is the diagonal. What is the breadth? Its size is not known. 4 times 4 is 16. And 5 times 5 is 25. You take 16 from 25 and there remains 9. What times what shall I take in order to get 9? 3 times 3 is 9. 3 is the breadth.15 The number along the upper left side is easily recognized as 30. The number immediately under the horizontal diagonal is 1; 24, 51, 10 (this is the modern notation for writing Babylonian numbers, in which the commas separate the sexagesition ‘digits’, and a semicolon separates the integral part of a number from its fractional part). Writing this number in the base-10 system, one gets 1+24/60+51/602+10/603=1.414213, which is nothing other than the decimal value of the square root of 2, accurate to the nearest one hundred thousandth. The conclusion is inescapable. The Babylonians knew the relation between the length of the diagonal of a square and its side: d=square root of 2. This was probably the first number known to be irrational. However, this in turn means that they were familiar with the Pythagorean Theorem – or, at the very least, with its special case for the diagonal of a square (d2=a2+a2=2a2) – more than a thousand years before the great sage for whom it was named. The square root of 2, known as Pythagoras’ constant, is the positive real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number 2 (see Figures 3 and 4).16, 17 Figure 4 Square root of 2. Full size image Two factors with regard to this tablet are particularly significant. First, it proves that the Babylonians knew how to compute the square root of a number with remarkable accuracy. The unknown scribe who carved these numbers into a clay tablet nearly 4000 years ago showed a simple method of computing: multiply the side of the square by the square root of 2. But there remains one unanswered question: Why did the scribe choose a side of 30 for his example? Probably, 30 was used for convenience, as it was part of the Babylonian system of sexagesimal, a base-60 numeral system. From this one derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 min in an hour and 360 (60 × 6) degrees in a circle.18 Today, the Pythagorean Theorem is thought of as an algebraic equation, a2+b2=c2; but this is not how Pythagoras viewed it. To Pythagoras it was a geometric statement about areas. It was with the rise of modern algebra, circa 1600 CE, that the theorem assumed its familiar algebraic form. Formally, the Pythagorean Theorem is stated in terms of area: In any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle). An area interpretation of this statement is shown in Figure 5.19 Figure 5 Area version of Pythagoras’ Theorem. Full size image The theorem is usually summarized as follows: The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. A PEOPLE WHO USED THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM? Ancient Egyptians (arrow 4, in Figure 2), concentrated along the middle to lower reaches of the Nile River (arrow 5, in Figure 2), were a people in Northeastern Africa. The ancient civilization of the Egyptians thrived 500 miles to the southwest of Mesopotamia. The two nations coexisted in relative peace for over 3000 years, from circa 3500 BCE to the time of the Greeks. As to the claim that the Egyptians knew and used the Pythagorean Theorem in building the great pyramids, there is no evidence to support this claim. Egypt has over 100 pyramids, most built as tombs for their country's Pharaohs. I would be remiss if I did not include an image of the iconic Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamen, aka King Tut (Figure 6). Egypt (arrow 4, in Figure 2) and its pyramids are as immortally linked to King Tut as are Pythagoras and his famous theorem. King Tut ruled from the age of 8 for 9 years, 1333–1324 BC. He was born in 1341 BC and died (some believe he was murdered) in 1323 BC at the age of 18.20 Figure 6 ‘King Tut’ (Not the famous burial mask). Full size image THE TEACHER WHO COLLECTED PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM PROOFS Elisha Scott Loomis (1852–1940) (Figure 7), an eccentric mathematics teacher from Ohio, spent a lifetime collecting all known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem and writing them up in The Pythagorean Proposition, a compendium of 371 proofs. The manuscript was prepared in 1907 and published in 1927. A revised second edition appeared in 1940, and this was reprinted by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics in 1968 as part of its ‘Classics in Mathematics Education’ series. Loomis received literally hundreds of new proofs from after his book was released up until his death, but he could not keep up with his compendium. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether certain proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Befitting of someone who collects solutions of the Pythagorean Theorem (I belittle neither the effort nor its value), Loomis, known for living an orderly life, extended his writing to his own obituary in 1934, which he left in a letter headed ‘For the Berea Enterprise immediately following my death’. He died on 11 December 1940, and the obituary was published as he had written it, except for the date of his death and the addresses of some of his survivors.21 Figure 7 Elisha Scott Loomis. Full size image A 12-YEAR-OLD EINSTEIN ‘PROVES’ THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM According to his autobiography, a preteen Albert Einstein (Figure 8) devised a new ‘proof’ (he was careful to put the word in quotation marks, evidently not wishing to take credit for it) of the Pythagorean Theorem based on the properties of similar triangles. Many known proofs use similarity arguments, but this one is notable for its elegance, simplicity and the sense that it reveals the connection between length and area that is at the heart of the theorem.22 Figure 8 Albert Einstein, age 12. Full size image About his ‘holy geometry book’, Einstein in his autobiography says: At the age of 12, I experienced a second wonder of a totally different nature: in a little book dealing with Euclidean plane geometry, which came into my hands at the beginning of a school year. Here were assertions, as for example the intersection of the three altitudes of a triangle in one point, which – though by no means evident – could nevertheless be proved with such certainty that any doubt appeared to be out of the question. This lucidity and certainty made an indescribable impression upon me. For example I remember that an uncle told me the Pythagorean Theorem before the holy geometry booklet had come into my hands. After much effort I succeeded in ‘proving’ this theorem on the basis of the similarity of triangles … for anyone who experiences [these feelings] for the first time, it is marvelous enough that man is capable at all to reach such a degree of certainty and purity in pure thinking as the Greeks showed us for the first time to be possible in geometry.23 EINSTEIN’S CHILDHOOD FASCINATION WITH THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM BEARS FRUIT Einstein (Figure 9) used the Pythagorean Theorem in the Special Theory of Relativity (in a four-dimensional form), and in a vastly expanded form in the General Theory of Relatively. The following excerpts are worthy of inclusion. Figure 9 Einstein. Full size image Pythagorean Theorem in the Special Theory of Relativity (1905) Albert Einstein's Metric equation is simply Pythagoras’ Theorem applied to the three spatial co-ordinates and equating them to the displacement of a ray of light. Special relativity is still based directly on an empirical law, that of the constancy of the velocity of light. dx2+dy2+dz2=(c dt)2 where c dt is the distance traveled by light c in time dt. The fact that such a metric is called Euclidean is connected with the following. The postulation of such a metric in a three-dimensional continuum is fully equivalent to the postulation of the axioms of Euclidean Geometry. The defining equation of the metric is then nothing but the Pythagorean Theorem applied to the differentials of the co-ordinates. In the special theory of relativity those co-ordinate changes (by transformation) are permitted for which also in the new co-ordinate system the quantity (c dt)2 (fundamental invariant dS2) equals the sum of the squares of the co-ordinate differentials. Such transformations are called Lorentz transformations.24 Pythagorean Theorem in the General Theory of Relativity (1915) From the latest results of the theory of relativity, it is probable that our three-dimensional space is also approximately spherical, that is, that the laws of disposition of rigid bodies in it are not given by Euclidean geometry, but approximately by spherical geometry. According to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical properties of space are not independent, but they are determined by matter. I wished to show that space time is not necessarily something to which one can ascribe to a separate existence, independently of the actual objects of physical reality. Physical objects are not in space, but these objects are spatially extended. In this way the concept ‘empty space’ loses its meaning. The fact that such a metric is called Euclidean is connected with the following. The postulation of such a metric in a three-dimensional continuum is fully equivalent to the postulation of the axioms of Euclidean Geometry. The defining equation of the metric is then nothing but the Pythagorean Theorem applied to the differentials of the co-ordinates.25 The Theory of Relativity and the Pythagorean Theorem The above excerpts – from the genius himself – precede any other person's narrative of the Theory of Relativity and the Pythagorean Theorem. Accordingly, I now provide a less demanding excerpt, albeit one that addresses the effects of the Special and General theories of relativity. … the most important effects of special and general theory of relativity can be understood in a simple and straightforward way. The system of units in which the speed of light c is the unit of velocity allows to cast all formulas in a very simple form. The Pythagorean Theorem graphically relates energy, momentum and mass.26 EUCLID’S ELEMENTS Euclid of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician (Figure 10), and is often referred to as the Father of Geometry. The date and place of Euclid's birth, and the date and circumstances of his death, are unknown, but it is thought that he lived circa 300 BCE. His work Elements, which includes books and propositions, is the most successful textbook in the history of mathematics. In it, the principles of what is now called Euclidean Geometry were deduced from a small set of axioms. Figure 10 Artist's impression of Euclid. Full size image When Euclid wrote his Elements around 300 BCE, he gave two proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem: The first, Proposition 47 of Book I, relies entirely on the area relations and is quite sophisticated; the second, Proposition 31 of Book VI, is based on the concept of proportion and is much simpler. The first could not be Pythagoras’ own proof because geometry was simply not advanced enough at that time. He may have used Book VI Proposition 31, but, if so, his proof was deficient, because the complete theory of Proportions was only developed by Eudoxus, who lived almost two centuries after Pythagoras.27 Euclid's Elements furnishes the first and, later, the standard reference in geometry. It is a mathematical and geometric treatise consisting of 13 books. It comprises a collection of definitions, postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions) and mathematical proofs of the propositions. Elements’ table of contents is shown in Figure 11.28 One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's Elements is shown in Figure 12.29 Figure 11 Euclid's elements. Full size image Figure 12 One of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid's elements. Full size image Euclid provided two very different proofs, stated below, of the Pythagorean Theorem. Euclid was the first to mention and prove Book I, Proposition 47, also known as I 47 or Euclid I 47. This is probably the most famous of all the proofs of the Pythagorean proposition. Book VI, Proposition 31: In right-angled triangles the figure on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle. Book I, Proposition 47: In right-angled triangles the square on the side opposite the right angle equals the sum of the squares on the sides containing the right angle. Euclid I 47 is often called the Pythagorean Theorem, called so by Proclus – a Greek philosopher who became head of Plato's Academy and is important mathematically for his commentaries on the work of other mathematicians – and others centuries after Pythagoras and even centuries after Euclid.30 Although many of the results in Elements originated with earlier mathematicians, one of Euclid's accomplishments was to present them in a single, logically coherent framework, making them easy to use and easy to reference, including a system of rigorous mathematical proofs that remains the basis of mathematics twenty-three centuries later. Although best known for its geometric results, Elements also includes number theory. It considers the connection between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes, the infinitude of prime numbers and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers.31 The geometrical system described in the Elements was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, however, this system is often referred to as Euclidean Geometry to distinguish it from other so-called Non-Euclidean geometries that mathematicians discovered in the nineteenth century.32 A simple proof of the Pythagorean Theorem At this point in my plotting of the 4000-year-old story of Pythagoras, I feel it is fitting to present one proof of the famous theorem. For me, the simplest proof among the dozens of proofs that I read in preparing this article is that shown in Figure 13.33, 34, 35 1 Start with four copies of the same triangle. Three of these have been rotated 90°, 180° and 270°, respectively. Each has area ab/2. (See upper part of Figure 13.) 2 Combine the four triangles to form an upright square with the side (a+b), and a tilted square-hole with the side c. (See lower part of Figure 13.) 3 Compute the area of the big square in two ways: The direct area of the upright square is (a+b)2 The collective-four-copies area of the titled square-hole is 4(ab/2)+c2 4 (a+b)2=4(ab/2)+c2 Figure 13 A simple proof of the Pythagorean Theorem. Full size image QED (abbreviation, Latin, Quod Erat Demonstrandum: that which was to be demonstrated.) A GENERALIZED VERSION OF THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM In the seventeenth century, Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665) (Figure 14) investigated the following problem: for which values of n are there integer solutions to the equation Figure 14 Pierre de Fermat. Full size image It is known that when n=2 then an integer solution exists from the Pythagorean Theorem. Fermat conjectured that there were no non-zero integer solutions for x and y and z when n was greater than 2. He did not leave a proof, though. Instead, in the margin of a textbook, he wrote that he knew that this relationship was not possible, but he did not have enough room on the page to write it down. His conjecture became known as Fermat's Last Theorem. This may appear to be a simple problem on the surface, but it was not until 1993 when Andrew Wiles of Princeton University finally proved the 350-year-old marginalized theorem, which appeared on the front page of the New York Times.36 Today, Fermat is thought of as a number theorist, in fact perhaps the most famous number theorist who ever lived. It is therefore surprising to find that Fermat was a lawyer, and only an amateur mathematician. Also surprising is the fact that he published only one mathematical paper in his life, and that was an anonymous paper written as an appendix to a colleague's book. Because Fermat refused to publish his work, his friends feared that it would soon be forgotten unless something was done about it. His son Samuel undertook the task of collecting Fermat's letters and other mathematical papers, comments written in books and so on with the goal of publishing his father's mathematical ideas. Samuel found the marginal note (the proof could not fit on the page) in his father's copy of Diophantus's Arithmetica. In this way the famous Last Theorem came to be published.37 FERMAT’S LAST THEOREM: SOLVED Sir Andrew John Wiles, KBE (Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire), mathematician and professor at Princeton University, specializing in number theory, is forever famous for proving Fermat's Last Theorem (Figure 15). Figure 15 Sir Andrew Wiles. Full size image Andrew Wiles was born in Cambridge, England in 1953, and attended King's College School, Cambridge (where his mathematics teacher David Higginbottom first introduced him to Fermat's Last Theorem). He earned his BA in 1974 after study at Merton College, Oxford, and a PhD in 1980 after research at Clare College, Cambridge. His graduate research was guided by John Coates beginning in the summer of 1975. Together they worked on the arithmetic of elliptic curves with complex multiplication using the methods of Iwasawa theory. He further worked with Barry Mazur on the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory over Q and soon afterwards generalized this result to totally real fields. Taking approximately 7 years to complete the work, Wiles was the first person to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, earning him a place in history. Andrew Wiles’ most famous mathematical result is that all rational semi-stable elliptic curves are modular, which, in particular, implies Fermat's Last Theorem. Wiles was introduced to Fermat's Last Theorem at the age of 10. He tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves under the supervision of John Coates. In the 1950s and 1960s, a connection between elliptic curves and modular forms was conjectured by the Japanese mathematician Goro Shimura based on some ideas that Yutaka Taniyama posed. In the West, this conjecture became well known through a paper by André Weil. With Weil giving conceptual evidence for it, it is sometimes called the Shimura–Taniyama–Weil conjecture. It states that every rational elliptic curve is modular. The full conjecture was proven by Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor in 1998 using many of the methods that Andrew Wiles used in his 1995 published papers.38 CONCLUSION I provide the story of Pythagoras and his famous theorem by discussing the major plot points of a 4000-year-old fascinating story in the history of mathematics, worthy of recounting even for the math-phobic reader. It is more than a math story, as it tells a history of two great civilizations of antiquity rising to prominence 4000 years ago, along with historic and legendary characters, who not only define the period, but whose life stories individually are quite engaging. The intriguing plot points of the story are: 1 Pythagoras is immortally linked to the discovery and proof of a theorem, which bears his name – even though there is no evidence of his discovering and/or proving the theorem. 2 Greek mathematician Euclid, referred to as the Father of Geometry, lived during the period of time about 300 BCE, when he was most active. His work Elements is the most successful textbook in the history of mathematics. Euclid I 47 is often called the Pythagorean Theorem, called so by Proclus, a Greek philosopher who became head of Plato's Academy and is important mathematically for his commentaries on the work of other mathematicians centuries after Pythagoras and even centuries after Euclid. 3 There is concrete (not Portland cement, but a clay tablet) evidence that indisputably indicates that the Pythagorean Theorem was discovered and proven by Babylonian mathematicians 1000 years before Pythagoras was born. 4 So many people, young and old, famous and not famous, have touched the Pythagorean Theorem. The eccentric mathematics teacher Elisha Scott Loomis spent a lifetime collecting all known proofs and writing them up in The Pythagorean Proposition, a compendium of 371 proofs. The manuscript was published in 1927, and a revised, second edition appeared in 1940. As for the exact number of proofs, no one is sure how many there are. Surprisingly, geometricians often find it quite difficult to determine whether some proofs are in fact distinct proofs. Moreover, the theorem seemingly has no ending, as every year students, academicians and problem solvers with a mathematical bent tackle the theorem in an attempt to add new and innovative proofs. 5 In addition, many people's lives have been touched by the Pythagorean Theorem. A 12-year-old Albert Einstein was touched by the earthbound spirit of the Pythagorean Theorem. The wunderkind provided a proof that was notable for its elegance and simplicity. However, the spirit of the Pythagoras’ Theorem was not finished with young Einstein: two decades later he used the Pythagorean Theorem in the Special Theory of Relativity (in a four-dimensional form), and in a vastly expanded form in the General Theory of Relativity. That Einstein used Pythagorean Theorem for his Relativity would be enough to show Pythagorean Theorem's value, or importance to the world. But, people continued to find value in the Pythagorean Theorem, namely, Wiles. 6 The theorem's spirit also visited another youngster, a 10-year-old British Andrew Wiles, and returned two decades later to an unknown Professor Wiles. Young Wiles tried to prove the theorem using textbook methods, and later studied the work of mathematicians who had tried to prove it. When he began his graduate studies, he stopped trying to prove the theorem and began studying elliptic curves, which provided the path for proving Fermat's Theorem, the news of which made to the front page of the New York Times in 1993. Sir Andrew Wiles will forever be famous for his generalized version of the Pythagoras Theorem.

He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. ‘The scope and depth of his interests were without precedent … .

A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction or ratio (rational). The numerator and the denominator of the fraction are both integers. When the fraction is divided out, it becomes a terminating or repeating decimal. (The repeating decimal portion may be one number or a billion numbers.) Rational numbers can be ordered on a number line. An irrational number cannot be expressed as a fraction. Irrational numbers cannot be represented as terminating or repeating decimals. Irrational numbers are non-terminating, non-repeating decimals.

And as a boy on his home island of Samos, he would have been exposed to the building of the largest stone temple in Ancient Greece (to Hera) and the incredible engineering feat of the tunnel of Eupalinos.Iamblichus’s “life of Pythagoras” [1] is worth a read as he had access to all the old sources now lost. The relationship between math and spirituality was very strong back then!There are lots of fun stories that may be true but no one will ever know. In Diogenes Laertius’ “Lives of the Philosophers,” it is claimed that when Pythagoras made his discovery of what we call the Pythagorean theorem, he sacrificed 100 oxen (a hecatomb) [1]. As noted by Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carrol), “that would produce an inconvenient supply of meat” [3], especially for a vegetarian. Iamblichus, on the other hand, claims it was a single ox — and made of flour![1] Guthrie, K. S., & Fideler, D. R. (Eds.). (1987). The Pythagorean sourcebook and library: an anthology of ancient writings which relate to Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy. Red Wheel&#x2F;Weiser.[2] “he sacrificed a hecatomb, when he had discovered that the square of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle was equal to the squares of the sides containing the right angle.” DL, found in [1][3] Maor, E.

[1] Its authenticity is dubious, but there&#x27;s probably at least parts of truth in it. In a nutshell, Pythagoras started a cult based around numbers, and the pseudo-divine purity of rational numbers - of which everything can be represented.Hippasus, a member of said cult, however managed to compellingly demonstrate that the square root of 2 could not be a rational number. Pythagorus tried to swear him to silence. When that did no twork, he had him killed.

Seems unlikely to me! In any case, Hippasus was a fascinating figure:“Aristoxenus (Fr. 90 Wehrli = DK I 109. 31 ff.) reports that Hippasus prepared four bronze disks of equal diameters, whose thicknesses were in the given ratios, and it is true that, if free hanging disks of equal diameter are struck, the sound produced by, e.g., a disk half as thick as another will be an octave apart from the sound produced by the other disk (Burkert 1972a, 377). Hippasus, thus, may be the first person to devise an experiment to show that a physical law can be expressed mathematically (Zhmud 2012a, 310).” [1]Also in [2] this experiment is claimed to be the first documented scientific experiment in history. After all, Hippasus took a mathematical model for a physical phenomenon (how consonance relates to the mathematical ratios of a musical string) and tests the generalization of that model in a another physical medium (viz. bronze chimes with the same ratios 1:2 and 2:3 make the octave and fifth).I wish they’d put this stuff in elementary math books when kids learn about Pythagoras.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plato.stanford.edu&#x2F;entries&#x2F;pythagoreanism&#x2F;#hippasus[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S240587262... reply detourdog 1 minute agorootparentone of my goals is a collection of educational activities based on the ground breaking earlier discoveries.

Pythagoreans preached that all numbers could be expressed as the ratio of integers, and the discovery of irrational numbers is said to have shocked them. However, the evidence linking the discovery to Hippasus is unclear.> Pappus merely says that the knowledge of irrational numbers originated in the Pythagorean school, and that the member who first divulged the secret perished by drowning. reply frankplow 2 hours agorootparentprevIt also says “one writer even has Pythagoras himself \"to his eternal shame\" sentencing Hippasus to death by drowning, for showing \"that 2√2 is an irrational number”.” reply moshun 2 hours agorootparentprevwas drowned was the version I heard in school. reply dmoo 3 hours agorootparentprevThat seems irrational… reply seasox 3 hours agorootparentAt least he kept his cult real reply selcuka 3 hours agorootparentprevI believe the whole story is imaginary. reply jaredsohn 3 hours agorootparentor at least more complex than described reply r13a 2 hours agorootparentUnless the story has some transcendental meaning ... reply Cyphase 2 hours agorootparentOnly if you&#x27;re primed to see that. reply nopurpose 1 hour agorootparentDon&#x27;t you think this discussion is tangental to the topic? reply Cyphase 39 minutes agorootparentI think that&#x27;s hyperbolic.

His Egyptian connection is attested early by Herodotus and his devotion to diverse schools of wisdom is attested in a critical statement by his contemporary, Heraclitus.Of course it’s hard to know. But Plato wrote several letters about his trip to Italy, because he was briefly enslaved there before being freed by his friend the Pythagorean Archytas (who is famous for creating a steam powered flying machine and wrote a work on mechanical engineering). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digitalcommons.unl.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1... reply spaceman_2020 2 hours agoparentprev> initiated into every mystery cult he couldAnd in turn, his followers created a strange cult after him!

The Babylonian tablet mentioned in the article doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything like thataccording to the article, this Babylonian tablet does come closer to theorem than you are suggesting. They weren&#x27;t using Pythagorean triples, rather they figured out that the diagonal of a unit square is the square root of 2, and knew how to calculate that:1 + 24&#x2F;60 + 51&#x2F;602 + 10&#x2F;603 = 1.414213 reply hyperthesis 4 hours agorootparentAgree it&#x27;s closer but still an instance. reply fsckboy 3 hours agorootparentdepends on the method they used to come up with the formula. It&#x27;s not obvious that the sum of a \"more complicated than you can do in your head\" series of fractions would be either the square root of two or the the diagonal of a square, let alone both. This is a fragment of a single clay tablet. If they had a systematic method of coming up with this convergent series, there might have been a stack of tablets showing square root of three, five, etc. It seems pretty highly suggestive to me. reply ssener2001 1 hour agorootparentI agree.Obtaining this formula by observing is more difficult than obtaining it by proving it. Besides, it is an issue that is already needed in field work. If you have pen, paper and a good number system, it shouldn&#x27;t be too difficult to find the formula with shapes. reply usrusr 2 hours agoparentprevWhy would you need numbers for right angles? You need a straight line and a string.But I agree with the second paragraph: there&#x27;s a huge difference between a procedure that is handed down as part of \"this is how we estimate a building project\" and a theorem that is declared universal truth and base for all kinds of other theorems. Even if they are exactly the same thing. reply WalterBright 5 hours agoparentprev> Every group who ever managed to build a building with a rectangular foundation figured out the relation between the side lengths and the diagonal.I don&#x27;t see why that was necessary. You can get pretty far with eyeballing it and custom cutting to fit. reply saithound 5 hours agorootparentA \"you\" can, and many individual \"you\"s presumably did that, to general satisfaction. But the implicit assumption you made is that eyeballing and cutting is easy, while triangles are hard, even though it&#x27;s the other way around, especially with stone age tools.But we&#x27;re talking about groups of people, \"they\", who all build a lot. Such groups tend to have a few people who make these observations, and then the observations proliferate, because they are both way easier to use than the alternative hack-work, and yield much more aesthetically pleasing results. Especially in the stone age when you nornally don&#x27;t have easy access to anything at all with a right angle (unlike in modern construction) and you build stuff out of clay bricks, where minor inaccuracies inevitably add up and make your life much harder down the road. Tying together three pieces of string with prescribed ratios, pull it tight was a very easy way to get a right angle compared to anything that came before.It&#x27;s necessary in the sense that stone age construction is so much easier if you know about it, and so much harder if you don&#x27;t. Those who didn&#x27;t come up with it didn&#x27;t do such construction, because doing difficult things is harder than doing easy things. reply WalterBright 1 hour agorootparentYou can easily accurately lay out a large square without knowledge of Pythagorean Theorem.1. lay out a straight line 2x in length.2. find midpoint (easy by drawing an arc with a string from each end point. Basic compass & ruler technique.3. draw another arc from the midpoint, of radius 1x. Try different spots on the arc until it is equidistant from each of the endpoints of the line.4. voila! an accurate right angle. Laying out the rest of the square is now trivial. reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparentprev>A \"you\" can, and many individual \"you\"s presumably did that, to general satisfactionI was chatting with the person that was in charge of marking the fields for the local youth soccer league.

    "originBody": "Svix Blog WebsiteBlogDocumentationCommunityGithubSignup Published on Wednesday, October 4, 2023 Strong static typing, a hill I'm willing to die on... Authors Name Tom Hacohen Twitter @TomHacohen Svix is the enterprise ready webhooks sending service. With Svix, you can build a secure, reliable, and scalable webhook platform in minutes. Looking to send webhooks? Give it a try! Edit: previous version of this post didn't have \"static\" in the title to keep it short (but the body did). Added it in the title for clarification. I've been writing software for over 20 years, and with every day that goes by I grow more certain that strong static typing is not just a good idea, but also almost always the right choice. There are definitely uses for untyped languages (or language variants), for example they are much nicer when using a REPL, or for throwaway scripts in environments that are already hopelessly untyped (e.g. the shell). In almost every other case, however, strong typing is strongly preferred. There are advantages to not using types, such as a faster development speed, but they pale in comparison to all of the advantages. To that I say: Writing software without types lets you go at full speed. Full speed towards the cliff. The question around strong static typing is simple: would you rather work a bit more and get invariants checked at compile-time (or type-checking time for non-compiled languages), or work a bit less and have them be enforced at runtime, or even worse not enforced even at runtime (JavaScript, I'm looking at you... 1 + \"2\" == 12). Getting errors at runtime is a terrible idea. First, it means that you won't always catch them during development. Second, when you do catch them, it will happen in a customer facing manner. Yes, tests help, but writing tests for every possible mistyped function parameter is impossible given the endless possibilities. Even if you could, having types is much easier than testing for wrong types. Types lead to less bugs Types also offer annotations to code that benefit both humans and machines. Having types is a way to more strictly define the contract between different pieces of code. Consider the following four examples. They all do exactly the same thing just with varying level of contract definition. // Params: Name (a string) and age (a number). function birthdayGreeting1(...params) { return `${params[0]} is ${params[1]}!`; } // Params: Name (a string) and age (a number). function birthdayGreeting2(name, age) { return `${name} is ${age}!`; } function birthdayGreeting3(name: string, age: number): string { return `${name} is ${age}!`; } The first one doesn't even define the number of parameters, so it's hard to know what it does without reading the docs. I believe most people will agree the first one is an abomination and wouldn't write code like that. Though it's a very similar idea to typing, it's about defining the contract between the caller and the callee. As for the second and the third, because of the typing, the third will need less documentation. The code is simpler, but admittedly, the advantages are fairly limited. Well, until you actually change this function... In both the second and the third functions, the author assumes the age is a number. So it is absolutely fine to change the code as below: // Params: Name (a string) and age (a number). function birthdayGreeting2(name, age) { return `${name} will turn ${age + 1} next year!`; } function birthdayGreeting3(name: string, age: number): string { return `${name} will turn ${age + 1} next year!`; } The problem is that some of the places that use this code accept user input which was collected from an HTML input (so always a string). Which will result in: > birthdayGreeting2(\"John\", \"20\") \"John will turn 201 next year!\" While the typed version will correctly fail to compile because this function excepts age to be a number, not a string. Having the contract between a caller and callee is important for a codebase, so that callers can know when callees change. This is especially important for an open source library, where the callers and the callees are not written by the same group of people. With this contract it's impossible to know how things change when they do. Types lead to a better development experience Typing can also be used by IDEs and other development tools to vastly improve the development experience. You get notified as you code if any of your expectations are wrong. This significantly reduces cognitive load. You no longer need to remember the types of all the variables and the function in the context. The compiler will be there with you and tell you when something is wrong. This also leads to a very nice additional benefit: easier refactoring. You can trust the compiler to let you know whether a change you make (e.g. the change in our example above) will break assumptions made elsewhere in the code or not. Types also make it much easier to onboard new engineers to a codebase or library: They can follow the type definitions to understand where things are used. It's much easier to tinker with things as changes will trigger a compile error. Let's consider the following changes to our above code: class Person { name: string; age: number; } function birthdayGreeting2(person) { return `${person.name} will turn ${person.age + 1} next year!`; } function birthdayGreeting3(person: Person): string { return `${person.name} will turn ${person.age + 1} next year!`; } function main() { const person: Person = { name: \"Hello\", age: 12 }; birthdayGreeting2(person); birthdayGreeting3(person); } It's very easy to see (or use your IDE to find) all the places where Person is used. You can see it's initiated in main and you can see it's used by birthdayGreeting3. However, in order to know it's used in birthdayGreeting2, you'd need to read the entire codebase. The flip side of this is also that when looking at birthdayGreeting2, it's hard to know that it expects a Person as a parameter. Some of these things can be solved by exhaustive documentation, but: (1) why bother if you can achieve more with types? (2) documentation goes stale, here the code is the documentation. It's very similar to how you wouldn't write code like: // a is a person function birthdayGreeting2(a) { b = a.name; c = a.age; return `${b} will turn ${c + 1} next year!`; } You would want to use useful variable names. Typing is the same, it's just variable names on steriods. We encode everything in the type system At Svix we love types. In fact, we try to encode as much information as we possibly can in the type system, so that all of the errors that can be caught at compile time will be caught at compile time; and also to squeeze that extra mileage of developer experience improvements. For example, Redis is a string based protocol with no inherent typing. We use Redis for caching (among other things). The problem is that all of our nice typing benefits will be lost at the Redis layer, and bugs can happen. Consider the following piece of code: pub struct Person { pub id: String, pub name: String, pub age: u16, } pub struct Pet { pub id: String, pub owner: String, } let id = \"p123\"; let person = Person::new(\"John\", 20); cache.set(format!(\"person-{id}\"), person); // ... let pet: Pet = cache.get(format!(\"preson-{id}\")); There are a couple of bugs in the snippet: There's a typo in the second key name. We are trying to load a person into a pet type. To avoid such issues we do two things at Svix. The first is that we require the key to be of a certain type (not a generic string), and to create this type you need to call a specific fuction. The second thing we do, is force pairing a key to a value. So the above example would look something like: pub struct PersonCacheKey(String); impl PersonCacheKey { fn new(id: &str) -> Self { ... } } pub struct Person { pub id: String, pub name: String, pub age: u16, } pub struct PetCacheKey; pub struct Pet { pub id: String, pub owner: String, } let id = \"p123\"; let person = Person::new(id, \"John\", 20); cache.set(PersonCacheKey::new(id), person); // ... // Compilation will fail on the next line let pet: Pet = cache.get(PersonCacheKey::new(id)); This is already much better, and makes it impossible to get either of the previously mentioned bugs. Though we can do even better! Consider the following function: pub fn do_something(id: String) { let person: Person = cache.get(PersonCacheKey::new(id)); // ... } There are a couple of problems with it. The first is that it's not very clear which id it should be for. Is it a person? A pet? It's very easy to accidentally call it with the wrong one, like in the following example: let pet = ...; do_something(pet.id); // <-- should be pet.owner! The second is that we are losing the discoverability. It's a bit hard to know that a Pet has a relationship to a Person. So at Svix, we have a special type for each id to ensure that there are no mistakes. The adjusted code looks something like: pub struct PersonId(String); pub struct PetId(String); pub struct Person { pub id: PersonId, pub name: String, pub age: u16, } pub struct Pet { pub id: PetId, pub owner: PersonId, } This is indeed much better than our previous example. There is still one issue. If we accept the ids from the API, how do we know that they are valid? All of the pet ids in Svix, for example, are prefixed with pet_ and are then followed by a Ksuid like so: pet_25SVqQSCVpGZh5SmuV0A7X0E3rw. We want to be able to tell our customers that they pass the wrong id in the API, e.g. they pass a person id when a pet one is expected. One simple solution for this is to validate this (duh...) but it can be easy to forget to validate it everywhere that it's used. So we enforce that a PetId can never be created without first being validated. This way we know that all of the code paths that create a PetId first make sure it's valid. This means that when we return a 404 Not Found to a customer because a pet isn't found in the database, we can be sure it was actually a valid id that wasn't found in the database. If it wasn't a valid id, we would have already returned a 422 or 400 when it was passed to the API handlers. So why doesn't everyone like types? The main topic of argument against types are: Development speed Learning curve and types complexity The amount of effort and boilerplate required First of all, I'd argue that even if all of the above were true, the advantages mentioned above are well worth the trouble. Though I also don't agree with all of the above. The first one is development speed. Prototyping without types is definitely much faster. You can comment out pieces of the code and won't have a compiler complain to you. You can set the wrong values for some of the fields until you're ready to figure out the right ones, etc. Though like I said above: \"Writing software without types lets you go at full speed. Full speed towards the cliff.\" The problem is that this is just aggressive and unnecessary technical debt. You'll pay it mulitple times over when you need to debug why your code doesn't work (either locally, in the test suite, or in production). As for the learning curve: Yes, learning more things takes time. Though I'd say that most people don't need to be typing experts. They can just get by with very simple type expressions, and ask if they ever hit a wall. However, if you keep things simple, you'll probably rarely if ever hit one. Additionally, people are already required to learn how to code, learn frameworks (React, Axum, etc.), and so many other things. I don't think the learning burden is as significant as it's made out to be. Last, but not least, regarding the learning curve: I strongly believe that the benefits of a lessened learning curve by not having to know types, are much less than the benefits of using the type script to onboard on a specific codebase. Especially since learning types is a one time cost. The last point is about the amount of effort and boilerplate required to use types in your codebase. I strongly believe that the amount of effort is actually less than the amount of effort required by not writing types. Not using types requires significant documentation and testing in order to reach even a basic level of sanity. Documentation can go stale, and so can testing; and either way they require more effort than just adding the right types. Reading code with types is also easier, because you get the types inline instead of in the function documentation where it's in an inconsistent format with a lot of added noise. Yes, typing can be a pain in languages that don't support inference, e.g Java can be tedious: Edit: It seems that Java has type inference nowadays. Thanks pron for the correction on HN. Person person1 = newPerson(); Person person2 = newPerson(); Person child = makeChild(person1, person2); while other languages that have inference (like Rust), are much nicer: let person1 = new_person(); let person2 = new_person(); let child = make_child(person1, person2); So having the right tools definitely helps. Speaking of tools, in order to reap the benefits of your typing, you probably need to use a code editor (or IDE) that supports modern code completion that is language aware. Closing words I can see both side of the arguments on many topics, such as vim vs. emacs, tabs vs. spaces, and even much more controversial ones. Though in this case, the costs are so low compared to the benefits that I just don't understand why anyone would ever choose not to use types. I'd love to know what I'm missing, but until then: Strong typing is a hill I'm willing to die on.

You still end up with runtime bugs because you can&#x27;t actually use those types at runtime. You can&#x27;t encode a lot of the runtime logic into the type system so you&#x27;re still manually checking impossibilities everywhere. I find myself even having to create local variables just to make typescript detect an obvious condition.If a type system could basically remove the need for me to think about runtime bugs, then that&#x27;s an absolute killer feature that I doubt anyone would argue against. But most languages don&#x27;t provide that, so you&#x27;re stuck in this halfway point where you have all this overhead, some benefits, but you still can&#x27;t 100% trust your types.As for why there are no meaningful differences in bugs, speed, etc my guess is that it all evens out. Without the type system safety net you are much more likely to test your code and as a result less bugs go in. On the other side people rely too much on the type system that&#x27;s not good enough and then still end up with the same amount of runtime bugs. On one side you write code faster, but you have to test more, so it also evens out with writing more boilerplate, but with less tests.I really wanted some hard research on this, but I know it&#x27;s a hard one. reply tasn 15 hours agoparentI think most people would agree that types prevent a lot of bugs (and others posted research to support it in the thread), so the question is less about that and more about the subjective reasoning people have to decide the investment is not worth it. reply Draiken 15 hours agorootparent>I think most people would agree that types prevent a lot of bugsAgain, that&#x27;s not what research shows. Type checking bugs are most definitely not the most common ones and typing doesn&#x27;t really help with runtime bugs unless it&#x27;s a strongly typed language.I&#x27;m all for types, but after using TypeScript and seeing everyone (including the article) touting it as the solution, it simply isn&#x27;t all that better than vanilla JS.I did spend countless hours having to wrangle typescript when integrating with third party libraries, searching for types that were not always there, manually extending&#x2F;creating library types and so on.So no, it&#x27;s not as clear cut as some say it is.If we want to argue for types, then we should use strongly typed languages that prevent these bugs (if you can manage to create the right types, of course). Examples in TypeScript are simply not going to cut it because that&#x27;s a horrible example of a typed language. I mean, it&#x27;s not even a language.Edit: above all, hard research. If there&#x27;s research for this, why isn&#x27;t that in the article? reply the_af 8 hours agorootparent> Type checking bugs are most definitely not the most common onesThis is not a facetious question, so bear with me: what is a \"type checking bug\"?Do you mean \"a bug in language L that would have been caught by the typechecker T, if only L had it\"?That&#x27;s the only meaning I can think of that makes sense [1] (ok, thought of another one [2]). But what does it mean that \"most bugs\" aren&#x27;t of that kind? Is it that \"most bugs are of a kind that cannot be caught by any conceivable typechecker\"?--[1] We can safely disregard the other possible interpretation of \"a type checking bug is a bug in the typechecker itself\" ;)[2] Maybe \"this expected a list but I passed it an integer instead\"? I do occasionally trip over those with Python, but I think most typecheckers are more advanced than that, and can check for more interesting classes of bugs. reply marwis 15 hours agorootparentprev> Again, that&#x27;s not what research shows.

Typescript prevents runtime bugs for me day in day out. It also allows me to produce much more elegant and flexible solutions which would be infeasible in plain JavaScript. When people say there is no significant benefit compared to JavaScript it almost feels like I must be on a different planet or something.

So we can&#x27;t really make some sort of closed system assumption. A typical web app may interact with dozens of API services, some run by third parties. And maybe you can trust their API docs, but maybe not really, and they&#x27;re subject to updates anyways, so you always have to be on your toes.Even internally, you can&#x27;t really control all the type info from end to end. Even the most monolithic systems will have some sort of abstraction leak when going from JSON -> Object -> Relational storage. Even largely monolithic systems will typically break off some functionality (like email sending, websockets handling, etc) as a separate service. The boundary creates a co-evolving connection between separate services run by separate teams, with separate upgrade cycles, even without full microservices buy in. And that creates potential runtime type errors when mapping between these layers.Even if you&#x27;ve somehow plugged all those leaky abstractions and your tight type system has handled all the edge cases and is provably correct: the user will teach you otherwise on the UI layer. User input can vary wildly, and everything from device capabilities to personal disabilities to network throttling to authentication to using weird ISO characters to file sizes to strange input devices and legacy systems with their own quirks, will completely throw you off at some point.So no matter how type safe your language is, you&#x27;ll always have to deal with the untyped and unpredictable user layer. And the reason why JS has been so successful there is because of how flexible it is. It&#x27;s not as painful to make quick tweaks with JS as it is with a type system like Rust&#x27;s, for example.JS, for all its quirks, made a good amount of trade-offs for its target platform.Type errors are almost always the easiest types of errors to fix. What really will get you is debugging interdependent systems and services, and that pesky user layer. But people will spend extraordinary amounts of time maintaining complex type systems just so their OCD can be satisfied about believing, that at least for a moment, if their program compiles...that all is right with the world for that brief moment just before you deploy to production.Oh were that the case. I do think types are essential for mission and life critical systems, but testing is even more essential for those cases, so everything should already be thoroughly covered. For consumer apps, however, is it worth the cost in velocity? reply Hermitian909 13 hours agoparentprev> I really wanted some hard research on this, but I know it&#x27;s a hard one.I think we&#x27;ll have to settle for judgment calls.I tried going through some of the research we have on developer productivity a few years back and it&#x27;s almost all garbage or is only truly applicable to juniors (e.g. when you&#x27;re new you really benefit from quick feedback time on static errors).The entire space suffers from the fact that good experimental design is impossible to implement with anyone who&#x27;s not a college student (good luck getting professionals to follow your rules for months) and the curse of dimensionality from the need to disentangle individual variations, type of software development, management style, and a thousand other things to try and draw out a signal.Sadly, many things and life can&#x27;t be effectively measured. reply dgb23 15 hours agoparentprevExactly my thoughts!The article and many commenters here all talk about programmer ergonomics, productivity and \"correctness\".The current research shows that these things are neither improved nor weakened by static typing. There are (even recent) papers on comparing typed vs dynamic language with no meaningful results. So basically it&#x27;s entirely subjective.However there _is_ an actual effect of static typing that can be trivially proven: It enables a programmer to write more efficient code. That should be at the forefront of every discussion around typing discipline, because everything else is just _hot air_ at this point.TypeScript (used in the article) is an example that is _not_ actually strongly typed (it&#x27;s statically typed but weak) and it doesn&#x27;t even provide performance and memory layout guarantees, because the types are just comments. So you pay all of the cost of static typing without _any_ of the tangible benefits except documentation.To me it is surprising that we as a technical community completely ignore actual evidence and take our cultural and personal preferences as fact. reply the_af 6 hours agorootparent> The current research shows that these things are neither improved nor weakened by static typingI think there&#x27;s a difference between \"current research hasn&#x27;t been able to conclude anything\" and \"current research shows [thing]\".I believe static typing is better, but that there&#x27;s no conclusive research because there are many confounding variables and the experiments are really hard to conduct in the real world. reply tipiirai 6 hours agorootparent> I believe static typing is betterLike most of us here it seems.

The controlled studies are all done on college students, and therefore on pretty small short-lived projects. My instincts tell me that while static types may be optional at that scale, they are essential on large commercial projects that last for years, and projects like that are nearly impossible to properly study.Other studies try to compare bug rates between open source projects, but it&#x27;s hard to be confident in answers gleaned from that kind of observational study.

Where the \"grain\" and the \"salt\" are the actual details, variables and boundaries of the study.Aside from what you mention -longevity- many other variables will or can influence the outcome.

Statically typed languages will harm their business (but, I&#x27;m convinced, will benefit their customers and our industry at large) because that&#x27;s: deliver fast&cheap at the cost of all else. I&#x27;m certain, because I helped such agencies improve their ROI. \"YOLO\" turned out to be the most important factor to increase revenue (on short term!).I&#x27;m certain that if you are a startup who must onboard new hires because your are rapidly growing, having solid and enforced guidelines and guardrails in place helps a lot. One such guardrail is a typing system. (I&#x27;m certain because I&#x27;ve been there, we didn&#x27;t have any: it took new hires month(s) to have their first PR merged)I&#x27;m certain that if you have mixed teams where the seniors can get juniors unstuck, and where seniors can design and build the type systems (bounded domains, value-objects) the architecture (e.g. outside layers&#x2F;adapters that ensure everything within is guaranteed typed) the juniors are far more productive too. I&#x27;m certain because I&#x27;ve been in this role and we saw productivity improve drastically.etc. Such controlled studies are not only hard to do, they need to be read with even more care: did they study a situation or control for my cases at all? reply lolinder 10 hours agoparentprevStatic typing is just one slice of Swiss cheese in the pursuit of more reliable software. Yes, it will leave holes like any other technique, which is why you should mix and match them for maximum reliability.

It can improve readability sometimes (as a DSL for static unit tests&#x2F;executable docs).In general, dynamic languages are more agile and you can write more tests easier.

Basically it&#x27;s all a lie. You can&#x27;t use the types in runtime so all that effort you put into the types doesn&#x27;t actually translate when you want to use the type system to full effect. That was absolutely demoralizing.For me, the white elephant in the room is that the language doesn&#x27;t really matter all that much. Good developers will write good code and bad developers will write bad code.Good developers might use meaningful types and bad developers will use strings, records and numbers everywhere. Guaranteeing a string is passed and not a number is not gonna prevent many bugs. Guaranteeing a `PhoneNumber` is passed can truly prevent bugs.

You still end up with runtime bugs because you can&#x27;t actually use those types at runtime.That&#x27;s because TypeScript is not actually strongly typed, it is gradually typed; throw in a single \"any\" type into your TS and all static guarantees are now off. I agree that TypeScript is insufficient, and point to languages like Rust or Haskell (one of the languages with the lowest defect rate in the study [0]) that actually do offer static guarantees, and where use of untyped \"escape hatches\" is far less common and&#x2F;or is far more judiciously applied.> If a type system could basically remove the need for me to think about runtime bugs, then that&#x27;s an absolute killer feature that I doubt anyone would argue against.

I&#x27;ve spent a decade each building software in both paradigms and I now prefer not to use type systems.I find dynamic typing similar to how unit testing is a forcing function for writing composable code, it acts as a forcing function to writing simple code; simple to read and simple to comprehend.The argument that it helps inexperienced developers approach the codebase is, IMO, a poor one as it tends to incentivize an iteration loop that lacks understanding and is simply trying to make all the red go away. In fact I find that the type system is often a barrier to truly understanding what&#x27;s going on as it effectively adds a very domain specific language to every project that has to be learned on top of the language itself.There are methods to solving the problems presented in TFA that are just as robust as using types and which are simple to understand. Can types be used in a simple way? Sure. Are they ever? Not in my experience. I also don&#x27;t like autocomplete, so take that as you will.I may just be a grizzled greybeard screaming \"the code _is_ the documentation\", but perhaps that is born from my deep dissatisfaction with the current breed of get-big-paycheck-chatgpt-said-it&#x27;s-right devs that are currently flooding the industry. reply eyelidlessness 15 hours agoparent> I find dynamic typing similar to how unit testing is a forcing function for writing composable code, it acts as a forcing function to writing simple code; simple to read and simple to comprehend.If this were broadly true for most developers using dynamically typed languages, it would be a very compelling argument indeed. But I think there’s pretty strong evidence the opposite is generally true: actual types produced to document real world dynamic code tend to be vastly more complex than the equivalent functionality implemented with static types from the outset. In the TypeScript ecosystem, DefinitelyTyped is an excellent source of countless case studies. The types they provide are typically definitely not, as you put it, “used in a simple way”. That’s not complexity inherent to the type system, or the type definitions as provided; it’s complexity inherent to the dynamic code they describe.Equivalent packages which were statically typed from the outset tend to have much simpler interfaces because the types are defined upfront rather than retconned onto existing APIs. That doesn’t necessarily mean their interfaces are absolutely simple, but they’re typically relatively simple by comparison.I’d go so far as to say that you can’t know how simple or complex an interface is without specifying it. If “the code is the documentation” (which I agree is a great ideal!), then interfaces without code specifying them are under-documented by definition. The further the code specifying the interface is from the interface itself, the more obscured your documentation is. reply hparadiz 14 hours agorootparentDynamically typed language have very clear rules. It&#x27;s not magic. If you know these rules nothing about dynamically typed code is inherently problematic. It&#x27;s the difference between logic being in the code versus in the run time. You accept hundreds of rule sets built into the run time all the time. reply MrJohz 14 hours agorootparentAll programming languages - all computers even - have very clear rules. The complexity in software development usually has less to do with getting a computer to understand its own rules, and more to do with the boundaries between humans and those rules: for example, encoding human ideas into rigid computer rules, or trying as a human to understand the computer rules that someone else has written.So when you say \"if you know these rules nothing about dynamically typed code is inherently problematic\", my intuition says \"I probably don&#x27;t know these rules\". That goes for some of the basic rules like \"the first argument to this function is the haystack, the second is the needle\", but it also goes from some of the more complex rules like \"functions that take a user ID can also take a user object and extract the ID from that\" or \"the allowed states for this FSM are X, Y, and Z, and are always written in capital letters\". More importantly, a lot of the rules for my difference will not have been written by me, they&#x27;ll have been written by my colleagues, or else they were written by me, but it was more than six months ago and my memory is a bit hazy on the details.The point the previous poster was making, I think, was that while the rules may be very explicit (this is, after all, what any programming language is: explicit rules for a computer to follow), they can also be very complex. And, more specifically, the DefinitelyTyped examples show that the rules for dynamic software often tend to be very complex, or at least, complex enough to present difficulties when being modelled by a type system explicitly designed to model dynamic code. reply gls2ro 5 hours agorootparentprev> But I think there’s pretty strong evidence the opposite is generally trueI could not find good research that will decisively settle this dispute about static vs dynamic.

The evidence I’m speaking to is the complexity of the respective types themselves, ie either:- those produced in the course of developing a given software package with static types as an explicit part of the development process, versus- those produced post hoc to document the apparent interfaces of an equivalent package which has been produced without explicit typesOne might call foul, by saying that this criterion favors static types by evaluating the complexity in terms of static types. But the reason I think it’s a fair comparison is because the dynamic interface does have a static type representation, even if it has to be conjured into notation post hoc… in much the same way as a data store model does have a schema even if it’s not formally specified as such. reply digging 17 hours agoparentprev> The argument that it helps inexperienced developers approach the codebase is, IMO, a poor one as it tends to incentivize an iteration loop that lacks understanding and is simply trying to make all the red go away.

I know I used it at one point for all of them.For languages like JavaScript, Java and C#, it&#x27;s probably a method, so you can start typing. Might be substring(), might also be substr() or something like that.For Haxe, I thought it was not a method so I think it&#x27;s either part of Std or StringTools.If I use autocomplete, I have it in a few seconds, and I can also see the documentation on the parameters. Is the second parameter an index or a length? To be honest I have no idea.

Might be substring(), might also be substr() or something like that.In JavaScript, there are both, and a third one besides, largely for reasons of historical accumulation and inconsistent implementation: String.prototype.substr(start, length?) String.prototype.substring(start, end?) String.prototype.slice(start, end?)They’ve each got their strange nuances in behaviour (and, in so-ancient-you-certainly-don’t-care-about-them engines, cross-engine inconsistencies), so if you’re relying on autocomplete, it’s necessary that your autocomplete at the very least give some meaningful parameter names, because the difference between taking length and an end index is rather significant.Which one should you use? slice. It’s generally agreed to be the most reasonable of the three in what it does and how it works, and it matches Array.prototype.slice well. So: sorry that you thought it might be substring or substr, because those exist but you probably shouldn’t use them.(Related reading: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2243824&#x2F;what-is-the-diff....) reply imran-iq 10 hours agorootparentprev> My typing however, is very fast.This is because you can remember where the keys are.> For Haxe, I thought it was not a method so I think it&#x27;s either part of Std or StringTools.How would autocomplete help you here?

This is how you know not to look for a global function. The difference is that instead of reaching for autocomplete to try and fill in the gap, I go to the documentation. I basically share the same feelings&#x2F;experience with this comment[0]. Either I know what I am doing and I do not need autocomplete, or I need to learn in which case autocomplete just gets in my way and I would rather go to the docs.I know I am not alone in this, for example I watch the lead developer of pidgin, Gary Kramlich, on twitch[1]. He does not use autocomplete, any time he has to look something up, its straight to the docs.Similar with Jonathon blow[2], who is working on his own game, game engine, and language who just uses emacs (with no autocomplete) and visual studio for the debugger.And even Mitchell Hashimoto[3], who has a similar workflow of using a dumb editor and then going to the docs when needing to learn.> I can also see the documentation on the parameters. Is the second parameter an index or a length?The documentation on a per function basis does not contain enough information on how to use the library&#x2F;framework.

In fact I find that the type system is often a barrier to truly understanding what&#x27;s going on as it effectively adds a very domain specific language to every project that has to be learned on top of the language itself.What? It helps developers inexperienced with a given codebase (not necessarily inexperienced generally), because you can very easily understand the types being passed into functions. You may need to understand why a function is behaving a certain way, so you look at the arguments, if you see a type you don&#x27;t recognize you can push a button and your IDE will take you to the definition of that type. If you want to you can with another key combination see all the inheritors of that type, and so on.

I just don&#x27;t think most of the typing debates we see online are really telling us much.

Practical usage isn&#x27;t as sexy as diehard ideological arguments.That said, what JSON corresponds to doesn&#x27;t matter -- you&#x27;re parsing it into a data structure that makes sense for your use case. You do not need to represent arbitrary JSON, and should not -- only valid values. So maybe that means something likestruct Person {String name;int age;enum Country birthplace;Map other attributes;}I am baffled by the purists who act like this is somehow not allowed.Or if you genuinely are just building a generic JSON parsing library, that&#x27;s easy enough as you described. The pseudo BNF definition of JSON is simply mapped directly to sum and product types. I have worked on (very lightly) a popular java Json library (Jackson) and it was no problem...Another problem is lately there are novice people whose only exposure to type systems is, of all things, typescript (or pep484 python) which is a horrible example of a practical type system because (much like pep484) it&#x27;s been bolted on poorly onto an existing typeless language. reply alexvitkov 20 hours agoprevYou&#x27;re not \"moving faster\" if a typo is a runtime error and you&#x27;re not \"more productive\" if you can&#x27;t change a function signature without having to grep your codebase to find all callsites and pray you fixed them all.Types are good, but as with anything else people take it too far.

This was really an abuse of the `table` element of HTML, which was designed to display tabular data, but it was basically the only way to achieve many layouts like having a side menu bar, for example.Abusing `table` was bad for many reasons, including accessibility. People started to care about the semantic web and remembered that HTML is a markup language for content, not a style language for layout. So people advocated for using CSS for layout and reserving `table` for actual table data.But gradually this rule became both simpler and more ridiculously followed. People started talking about \"using divs instead of table\". They would look at a page source and if they saw `div` it would get a nod, but if they saw `table` the developer would be relentlessly abused because `table` is old-fashioned. Eventually, of course, someone reinvented tables using divs and CSS.And then people realised the pendulum had swung too far. reply timsneath 16 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s an irony that this comment is posted on HackerNews, where the entire page of comments is hosted in a bigfor layout.

You need to do runtime validation.And good luck untangling your type definitions when your requirements change. That one is the killer. Static types are premature concretions on the domain data model as you understand them now. They will change and if you are unlucky you will have to support multiple different variations of domain models in the same runtime. Good luck with that. Especially if you use inheritance.Granted, static types give compilers great leverage to optimize code, but, wouldn&#x27;t you believe: there are dynamically typed languages that have static types as a la card add-on.But for many, many use-cases, especially enterprise development, a dynamically typed, immutability-first, functional language pays off dividends in the long run.The categorical error that is made by many strong typing fans is that they assume you would write the same code - just without types.

In every dynamically typed system I&#x27;ve ever worked on, there have been important assumptions about data structures - sometimes checked dynamically in pre- or post- conditions, sometimes only checked in tests, and often simply not checked at all - scattered all around, such that changing requirements necessitated reasoning through the impact of the change on all these implicit assumptions. It was terrifying to make changes. Sure, easy to make a change and start up the application with the new code without a fuss.

I much prefer a static analysis pass saying, \"hey, you changed this interface, did you know this codepath over here relied on that thing you changed?\". Static type systems are not the only way to accomplish this, but in my view, they are a much less burdensome way to accomplish it than the level of dynamic validation and testing necessary to do so otherwise.But again, it&#x27;s just a frustrating debate, because clearly you have the exact opposite experience!

If I do the same thing in a dynamic language, I have to track things down myself, wait for unit tests to fail (hopefully I have 100% coverage...), and pray that there isn&#x27;t an escape. reply mecha_ghidorah 9 hours agoparentprev> And good luck untangling your type definitions when your requirements change. That one is the killer. Static types are premature concretions on the domain data model as you understand them now. They will change and if you are unlucky you will have to support multiple different variations of domain models in the same runtime. Good luck with that. Especially if you use inheritance.I actually found this way easier with static types because with static types I could be significantly more confident about every single place one of those types was used, and look at it and see if it needed changes. This was way fiddlier to do in a dynamically typed environment reply QuadrupleA 19 hours agoprevAs a developer who&#x27;s written hundreds of thousands of lines of C++, Python, and JS - I don&#x27;t know! It&#x27;s not so clear cut. I&#x27;m productive in all off them, although Python mostly wins. I wouldn&#x27;t write a game engine or a video codec with it though.JavaScript is inconsistent and weird, but Netscape&#x27;s legacy long since stuck us all into it.I can see in a very OOP-heavy style maybe, with huge nested classes, that compile&#x2F;parse time static typing saves a lot of mistakes - but I&#x27;ve come to see OOP as mostly a disaster, and simple functions and structured data almost always win the simplicity and maintainability battle. And modern language servers &#x2F; IDEs can catch a lot of typing errors during JS &#x2F; Python development.I&#x27;m persnickety about a lot of programming stuff, but never had a strong opinion about static vs dynamic typing. Both have millions of successful projects under their belt. reply BobbyJo 18 hours agoparentTo be fair, C++ is a pretty rough language to be productive in generally, type system aside. GC is the single largest productivity enhancement a language can offer. I&#x27;d be way more interested in how Golang, with it&#x27;s much simpler syntax&#x2F;types (but they&#x27;re still static) would compare. Even Java would be better, as, even though it&#x27;s very verbose, the cognitive load for most tasks is a fraction of C++&#x27;s. reply arp242 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s really hard, even with Go there are so many more differences than just types.e.g. in Python&#x2F;Ruby I had a REPL and used it a lot. Go doesn&#x27;t really have a good REPL, so I tend to not use it so much. I probably pay some in productivity for that?On the other hand, I type code like: name:=fun(\"foo\",\"bar\");if name==\"foo\"{fmt.Println(name)}And write and let gofmt sort it out. You can kind of do that in Ruby in theory (not sure if good formatters exist), but Python is more tricky (and I also think the auto-formatters for Python are bad and often make code worse).The flexibility of things like Active{Record,Model} in Rails are great, and hard to emulate with Go. People have tried, and it just doesn&#x27;t fit with the language very well.Go&#x27;s simple \"just compile to a statically linked binary\" distribution model probably saves me time, especially for distributing it to other people.Probably other differences I can&#x27;t think of right now.So between all of that, how do you split out the productivity of \"types\" vs. anything else?That&#x27;s also my problem with the research on this, because you just can&#x27;t, not really. What you need to do is compare e.g. Python with Mypy vs. without. I don&#x27;t think anyone has done that(?) And even then you run in to the problems with differences in tasks, differences in programmer experience and ability, etc. which matter because for a lot of these studies n tends to be small. reply kagakuninja 17 hours agorootparentprevMy language evolution went C > C++ > Java > ScalaJava was a huge boost, by eliminating the cognitive load of manual memory management.Scala can be used as a \"better Java\" with less verbosity, but also adds a number of extremely useful features; Java has slowly added some of them into the language over the last 8 years. reply sureglymop 16 hours agorootparentHave you tried Kotlin? I personally like it a lot as an alternative to Java and Scala. However, I hate any tooling around the JVM based languages. I cannot waste my time messing around with Maven, Gradle, etc. reply kagakuninja 15 hours agorootparentNo, I am very happy with Scala, and intend to use it for many years to come.JVM tooling IMO is fantastic, it is one of the largest open source communities, and there are many options if you don&#x27;t like Gradle or Maven. Also, as I understand it, the dependency management systems found in languages like Python and Node are horrible in comparison to the JVM, where it is usually not a problem. reply rdedev 19 hours agoparentprevIn python I mostly code in functional style. Even then types helps me a lot. I make a lot of typos or get the order of arguments wrong. Typing helps me a lot here especially when I&#x27;m doing ML. The last thing I want is my training code to crash after it spent 30nmins processing the data. I find pythons gradual typing a really good middle ground for quick prototyping and the type annotate functions once they are mature enough reply boxed 18 hours agorootparent> or get the order of arguments wrongThere&#x27;s a simple fix for that, just do keyword argument only everywhere you can.For me the hill I&#x27;m willing to die on is that labeled&#x2F;named&#x2F;keyword arguments are absolutely necessary and most of the usefulness of types is in fact just a shitty version of labeled arguments (god help you if you have a function where two or more arguments have the same type!) reply rdedev 16 hours agorootparentThe small downside to using kwargs is just the extra letters needed to call the function but I can live with that.As for args with the same type, you can use phantom types I guess but I haven&#x27;t explored it much in python. I&#x27;m pretty interested in the dfdx library in rust which can type enforce matrix or vector operations on it&#x27;s shape. Stuff like that would really help me reply boxed 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s an advantage imo. Makes the code more readable, and much more robust against bad refactors. reply AdamN 18 hours agoparentprevYou might like this video from WWDC a few years back on protocol-oriented programming (Swift): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=p3zo4ptMBiQ reply bjourne 18 hours agoprevThe discussion over whether strong typing is better than weak typing is settled [1], but not over whether static typing is better than dynamic typing. Adherents of static typing thinks that the compiler should check \"correctness\" by verifying type invariants, adherents of dynamic typing think that is a waste of time.I&#x27;m firmly in the latter camp. Because the compiler can&#x27;t check program correctness only type correctness. Type correctnes is necessary for program correctness, but NOT sufficient. Static typing adherents fail to recognize this, thus falsely believing that static typing guarantees them more than what it actually does (blub).Consider the article&#x27;s birthdayGreeting example. Author is happy that static typing catcges the birthdayGreeting(\"John\", \"20\") bug because \"20\" is not a number. But birthdayGreeting(\" \", 123) is not caught (\" \" is not a name) and neither is birthdayGreeting(\"Anna,\" -12335). birthdayGreeting(\"Anna\" 4.5), though, is caught, which arguably is wrong since 4.5 is an age.This is actually very important since \"type bugs\" are trivially easy to catch, while \"semantic bugs\" can stay undetected for years. An account balance stored as a uint that overflows, a number that must be prime at a certain program location, but isn&#x27;t, a list that must not be empty, etc. No, not even dependent types can guarantee these invariants.If you don&#x27;t believe me, read up on some catastrophic bugs. Those that have caused space ships to explode and cars to crash. To the best of my knowledge, not a single one has been caused by bona fide type errors. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the root cause has been a semantic error.[1] - Most people don&#x27;t understand that typing is measured over at least two axes, strong&#x2F;weak and static&#x2F;dynamic, and continue to conflate weak typing with dynamic typing. C is statically typed and weakly typed. Python is strongly typed and dynamically typed. Javascript is weakly typed and dynamically typed. reply eyelidlessness 18 hours agoparentMany of your examples could definitely be caught by static types, depending on the type system. But that’s less important than…> This is actually very important since \"type bugs\" are trivially easy to catchThis, IMO, is exactly why I’m in the static type camp. It’s so trivial that you can do it declaratively, inline with the code it’s testing, with instant feedback, at every call site and in every downstream expression&#x2F;statement. A type annotation doesn’t mean my semantic&#x2F;domain logic is sound, I still have to test that. but it could replace dozens of trivial tests orthogonal to the logic I care about… tests which, let’s face it, few people are going to write exhaustively otherwise. reply perrygeo 17 hours agorootparentThe amount of runtime checks and&#x2F;or tests required to emulate the guarantees of static types is huge. It&#x27;s perplexing that some people would rather do that manually.But to the point of triviality, static types tend to lull developers into a false sense of security. There are limits to their usefulness. You still need both runtime checks and test-time assertions for your logic. You just need less of them and they provide more value per line of code. But I&#x27;ve never seen a type system capable of expressing the entire problem domain in an ergonomic way. Not even close.For my money, a combination of: static types, property-based testing, unit&#x2F;integration tests, and an end-to-end test against prod are all required. You can compensate for the lack of one by putting more effort into another but you&#x27;re really just shuffling the \"correctness burden\" from one place to another. I like static types because it makes the rest of testing easier. But at some point, you&#x27;ve got to roll up your sleeves and make sure it works IRL. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentI question this \"false sense of security\" point. In my experience, people who prefer as much static analysis as possible, mostly based on types, are also more likely to be thinking about invariants and error cases more generally. I would go further to say that anyone who has really adopted a thinking-about-invariants-and-error-cases style of programming has almost certainly become frustrated with the amount of repetitive validation code required to accomplish that in projects with no static analysis of types. reply prewett 14 hours agorootparentprevIn a dynamically language you need 100% test coverage, because misspelling a variable name turns into a runtime error.On large projects this can be a problem. I worked on a Python server some years ago, and with every large program that supports exceptions, there&#x27;s a catch block somewhere that silently eats the exceptions it doesn&#x27;t process. Well, some modules were loaded dynamically, so my first spelling mistake (and second and third...) took quite a while to debug because things just didn&#x27;t work, the code didn&#x27;t get executed, but there were no errors. This also ate syntax errors, too, since that is also an exception. So if you edited the file, you had no idea if things actually still worked (or even compiled!) until you tested the functionality from the file. reply tasn 18 hours agoparentprev> Consider the article&#x27;s birthdayGreeting example. Author is happy that static typing catcges the birthdayGreeting(\"John\", \"20\") bug because \"20\" is not a number. But birthdayGreeting(\" \", 123) is not caught (\" \" is not a name) and neither is birthdayGreeting(\"Anna,\" -12335). birthdayGreeting(\"Anna\" 4.5), though, is caught, which arguably is wrong since 4.5 is an age.Author here. I think your examples illustrate my point rather than provide a counter example.I mentioned later in the post that we validate when creating the type (from e.g. user input) so we know that the `Name` type is always valid (and \" \") is not a name. So the type ensures that we have a valid name. So this will definitely be caught in our codebase.As for birthdayGreeting(\"Anna\" 4.5) and birthdayGreeting(\"Anna,\" -12335), number means a float in JS so it actually would be valid, though admittedly I had full integers in mind when writing this. Another example of where stricter typing than what TS providers (which Rust does!) would have helped better define the invariant.So in short: the problem in the code there was that I was trying to show a simple example, which means I didn&#x27;t define all the types as strictly as I normally would have, and it surfaced more bugs that would have been caught with types. reply sanderjd 16 hours agoparentprevThe specific examples you chose to illustrate this point are interesting, because to me, it is clear that what you want is a `Name` type that always represents a valid name and an `Age` type that always represents a valid age. Then you can put the validation in a single place (the constructors of those types) and write many methods like `birthdayGreeting` that can happily use values of those types without needing to take on the responsibility of validating them.I honestly don&#x27;t know of a good way to implement this pattern without type checking or at least optional type hints and static analysis. Instead, you can do validation of the input values in every single method, which is hugely burdensome, or you can assume callers are passing you valid values and write tests to make sure it isn&#x27;t too catastrophic if they don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t find either of these solutions satisfying. reply MayeulC 17 hours agoparentprev> Those that have caused space ships to explodeIt&#x27;s funny you should mention this, as it immediately brings [1] to my mind. This well-known incident was due to type-checking, with acceptable ranges defined ahead of time for some types (which resonates with your comment: make birthdayGreeting accept ranges 1-150 or something, easy to do in ADA).There are a few more well-publicized issues with spacecraft that could have been caught with better type-checking, including metric&#x2F;imperial conversions (why not build the unit into a type? Though the fault probably was with integration testing for [2]).Of course, you are right that type checking can&#x27;t find every code issue (especially algorithmic), it doesn&#x27;t replace tests. Instant feedback and type hints are invaluable during the development phase, though.In your example, one could probably replace the first name string by a person type&#x2F;object, by the way.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ariane_flight_V88[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mars_Climate_Orbiter reply bjourne 17 hours agorootparentNeither of those were \"bona fide type errors\". The fact that both errors ocurred while using statically typed languages shows that. The orbiter failed because inches were interpreted as centimeters. But as both datums were stored as floating point numbers, which they always would be, in any reasonable implementation, static typing wouldn&#x27;t have caught anything. The Ariane failure was due to a cast of a double to a short resuling in an overflow. Again, not something static typing can catch because it can&#x27;t statically check the value of an arbitrary double.No, even more types is not the solution. It&#x27;s not pratical to wrap every measurement in a Meter or Inch type (standardization is one issue, is my Meter type the same as your Meter type?) and it doesn&#x27;t significantly increase the amount of invariants checked. You still have range issues and you still won&#x27;t get a statically check PrimeNumber type.I&#x27;m not familiar with ADA, but VHDL has similar range constraints which are runtime checked. reply vouwfietsman 16 hours agorootparent> The fact that both errors ocurred while using statically typed languages shows thatObviously it doesn&#x27;t, since you can make a statically typed language program where every variable is a string map and every function takes variable args, and have no help from your compiler at any time because every type is always the right type. Sounds stupid, but in fact this is what happened in the examples.The examples are bona fide type errors, because even though a statically typed language is used, multiple different types of numbers got the same static type causing the issue. So the people here were offered the solution to their problem from their domain (two types of numbers), choose to use dynamic typing (make both a float even though they&#x27;re different things), causing the compiler to have no way of statically checking their code, and that caused a bug. It&#x27;s the opposite of a counter example.It is in fact the absence of enough typing that caused these issues. How much more typing do you need :) reply nyssos 16 hours agorootparentprev> But as both datums were stored as floating point numbers, which they always would be, in any reasonable implementation, static typing wouldn&#x27;t have caught anything.Types are not runtime representations, and any good nominal type system will allow you to avoid this sort of problem easily. For example, this Haskell code newtype Inches = Inches Double deriving Num newtype Centimeters = Centimeters Double deriving Num a :: Centimeters a = Centimeters 1.0 b :: Inches b = Inches 1.0 fine = a + a alsoFine = b + b mistake = a + bwill give this type error Couldn&#x27;t match expected type ‘Centimeters’ with actual type ‘Inches’ In the second argument of ‘(+)’, namely ‘b’ In the expression: a + b In an equation for ‘mistake’: mistake = a + bbut both `a` and `b` will be doubles at runtime. reply bjourne 15 hours agorootparentThat is why I wrote \"in any reasonable implementation\". Embedding physical quantities in the type system is possible in many language but is not practical. Hence why safety-critical software doesn&#x27;t contain declarations like yours. For example, what is the type of Inch * Inch? What is the type of Inch &#x2F; Inch? Sure, perhaps if NASA and their subcontractors had used a common well-developed physical quantities library then the bug could have been caught during compile-time. But I think it is a moot point since most people don&#x27;t use such libraries. reply esafak 12 hours agorootparent> For example, what is the type of Inch * Inch?An area, inch^2.> What is the type of Inch &#x2F; Inch?A unitless ratio?I don&#x27;t understand why this is not practical in safety-critical software. nyssos demonstrated what I believe is the right way to do it. reply bjourne 11 hours agorootparentThese semantics make the type incompatible with the Num class and attempting to plug your type into, say, a run of the mill ode solver likely won&#x27;t do what you want. So you have two options. 1) Rewrite all code to become \"quantity aware\". Multiplying two Matrix[Inch] results in a Matrix[Inch2] and so on. 2) Litter your code with floatToInch and inchToFloat conversions. I think you can see why both options suck? If you really can&#x27;t, then perhaps try finding some safety-critical software that relies on \"physical quantity types\" in some form or another? replythfuran 16 hours agorootparentprev>But as both datums were stored as floating point numbers, which they always would be, in any reasonable implementationIt doesn&#x27;t strike me as inherently unreasonable to use fixed point.

    "originBody": "Blog Vespa.ai Docs SUBSCRIBE Vespa Blog Blog for Vespa - The open big data serving engine Share Jon Bratseth Follow CEO Vespa.ai 03 Oct 2023 Vespa is becoming a company Today we’re announcing that we’re spinning Vespa.ai out of Yahoo as a separate company: Vespa.ai. Vespa began as a project to solve Yahoo’s use cases in search, recommendation, and ad serving. Since we open-sourced it in 2017, it has grown to become the platform of choice for applying AI to big data sets at serving time. Those working with large language models such as ChatGPT and vector databases turn to Vespa when they realize that creating quality solutions that scale involves much more than just looking up vectors. Enterprises with experience with search or recommender systems come to Vespa for the AI-first approach and unrivaled operability at scale. Even with the support built into the Vespa platform, running highly available stateful systems in production with excellence is challenging. We’ve seen this play out in Yahoo, which is running about 150 Vespa applications. To address the scalability needs, we created a centralized cloud service to host these systems, and in doing so, we freed up the time of up to 200 full-time employees and reduced the number of machines used by 90% while greatly improving quality, stability, and security. Our cloud service is already available at cloud.vespa.ai, helping people with everything from running quick Vespa experiments, to serving business-critical applications. In total we serve over 800.000 queries per second. While we’re separating Vespa from Yahoo, we’re not ending our relationship. Yahoo will own a stake in the new company and will be one of Vespa’s biggest customers for a long time to come. Vespa will continue to serve Yahoo’s personalized content, search and run new use cases leveraging large language models to provide new personalized experiences, something that can only be done at scale with Vespa. Creating a company around Vespa will enable us to bring these advantages to the rest of the world on a massive scale, allowing us to bring the efficiencies of our cloud service to enterprises already relying on Vespa, as well as help more companies solve problems involving AI and big data online. It will also let us accelerate development of new features to empower Vespa users to create even better solutions, faster and at lower cost, whether deploying on our cloud service or sticking with the open-source distribution. For, while Vespa offers features and scalability far beyond any comparable technology thanks to our decades-long focus on combining AI and big data online, there is so much more to do. As the world is starting to leverage modern AI to solve real business problems online, the need for a platform that provides a solid foundation for these solutions has never been stronger. As engineers, we admit this is the part that excites us the most. We look forward to empowering all of you to create online AI applications ever better and faster, and we hope you do too! « Announcing search.vespa.ai Copyright © 2023 Vespa Blog - Subscribe to updates - Vespa Blog RSS feed Mediumish Jekyll Theme by WowThemes.net",

When I worked at Yahoo back in 2005-2007 the Flickr team were using it to scale Flickr - they were integrating it in order to serve things like public tag pages, to take the load off their MySQL cluster.I remember understanding it as the internal equivalent to something like Solr, although actually it predated it - looks like the first public Solr open source release (coming out of CNET) was January 2006. reply jkb79 13 hours agoparentYeah, I worked with the Flickr team on that project. Scaling to billions of photos, with partial update support of popularity for ranking.Back then, the properties had to stand up their own Vespa cluster(s), later on we created a managed service out of it. And, yes, the original plan for Vespa was to be a Vertical Search Platform, that is where the name Vespa comes from.

I bought my first Vespa in 1984 reply cmcollier 9 hours agoprevThis is fun to see, and for a seriously deserving team!Vespa really is an impressive platform. I&#x27;ve been working with search platforms for a while, starting with FAST Instream, MarkLogic, Elastic, Weaviate, and now Vespa. As others have noted, Vespa has a deep technical lineage. You can see a lot of the hard earned lessons in the design, as well as improvements in the flaws of the spiritual predecessors (FAST et. al).The history alone makes the project interesting. But then, in the last couple of years (or maybe earlier), they started introducing all the fundamentals for supporting deep integration of tensors and a custom HNSW implementation. Whether accident or planning, this was a nice strategic move. They were leagues ahead, just in time for the popularization of learned embeddings.Now they have the best combination of traditional lexical search, semantic search with embeddings, and the combination of the two in hybrid search. That&#x27;s without even getting to all the functionality in the multi-phase ranking, hosted ML models, and document processing engine.Obviously I&#x27;m biased (we use Vespa at work for enterprise search products), but I can&#x27;t recommend this engine&#x2F;platform enough.Congrats again to the team! reply spullara 14 hours agoprevThey have absolutely the best take on embedding search + normal faceted search.

But I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s competitive today.This blog post says it&#x27;s \"developed by Yahoo\" which is I guess true. But it was originally an acquisition, largely developed by a team in Norway, and apparently most Vespa development still happens there. reply dathinab 13 hours agoparent> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s competitive todayvery, it&#x27;s outcompeting most vector databases on features and maturity when it comes to vector search while having very powerful and flexible and proven text search tooThe tricky part is, it&#x27;s more a platform to build complex search systems with then \"just\" a vector database. So if a found a company today which focus is to create clever multi phase search pipelines and train (e.g. domain adopt) LLMs for calculating embeddings etc. then it&#x27;s probably _the_ best solution by far, you probably can get away with having only AI engines devops and a single programmer (who might also most times just do devops). But if you need to deeply integrate it into a different existing search system things are less grate.And I would love to see some modernization, like having a format for structured queries which is more widely supported then YQL... (eying graphql here) reply bratao 13 hours agorootparentYeah +1 for VERY competitive. The vector capabilities of Vespa are incredible and the Text&#x2F;ranking features are amazing.

We just thought we&#x27;d prank him a bit about having more dangerous animals than they did in India. Nothing too serious.So a few months later I woke up early one morning and saw it had been snowing all night. I made sure to get over to the office before the traffic started ruining the image of barren, desolate place where you could entertain the idea of polar bears roaming the streets, looking for young, fresh engineering meat.I took a few photos, walked inside, and got busy looking for photos of polar bears that could fit into this idea of upping the Dangerous Wildlife War between India and the home of the proper vikings.So I did a little bit of photoshopping, uploaded it to my Flickr account, and sent the link to a few other yahoos around the world. We had a bit of fun with it, but I don&#x27;t think anyone with access to this worldwide web of information will be too fooled. (It&#x27;s quite easy to figure out that there are no polar bears on the Norwegian mainland, so I&#x27;ve never been too bothered about leaving it up there.)You can see the ehm... original at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;eirikref&#x2F;3262204184 for a few of the comments and fun from back then.Edit: So that&#x27;s about as definite as you&#x27;ll ever get it. And I&#x27;ll never again admit to it being photoshopped in any shape or form ;) reply sundarurfriend 9 hours agorootparent> the Dangerous Wildlife War between India and the home of the proper vikings.Was there an other side to this war? The most dangerous animal you&#x27;re likely to come across (realistically, without getting photoshop involved) in an average Indian street would be a monkey. I&#x27;ve also come across many varieties of snakes, from time to time, but they&#x27;re generally chill and just want to be left alone. The monkeys are ruthless bastards though, not to be trifled with. reply unmole 34 minutes agorootparentStray dogs are a much bigger problem on Indian streets.

They had no idea, and it wasn&#x27;t really a thing outside of a few minutes of pranking one engineer visiting us + a bit of photoshopping for fun.The only ones to ever get in touch about this whole thing was, 1) The Y! corporate blog who wanted us to make a lighthearted a fun write-up about the polar bears, which I cannot seem to find online anymore, and 2) a random local from Trondheim, Norway who sent me quite the angry e-mail telling me that I was single-handedly ruining the tourism business in town with that silly image. reply jkb79 12 hours agoparentprevHehe, it was a joke, we don&#x27;t have polar bears on the mainland of Norway.

If Piaggio isn&#x27;t litigating it, I wonder what their lawyers are even doing. reply rmccue 11 hours agorootparentThe standard generally is whether the trademark would cause confusion to or deceive consumers. Naming a company after an existing brand which is an invented word (being a corruption of googol) would fall under the latter, and intent matters too.As to the former, trademark classes are one of the ways in which confusion is determined, but it’s not the only way for sure.That said, if it’s a word borrowed from another language and there’s no intent to deceive, I imagine courts would allow it - see also Apple&#x2F;Apple Corps, and the many companies called “Delta” not in the airline business. reply danielheath 7 hours agorootparentAnd the ruling would be fine after how many years of paying lawyers to handle endless appeals? reply autoexec 13 hours agorootparentprevWasps are a nuisance known for causing pain and property destruction. \"vespa\" as a name for a product always seemed strange to me.

Also with many pure vector databases like Pinecone, you cannot describe an object with more than one vector, if you have different vector models for the object, you need different indexes, and then duplicate metadata across those indexes (if you need filtering + vector search).1 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.vespa.ai&#x2F;pretrained-transformer-language-models... reply ComputerGuru 7 hours agorootparentYou might want to add a \\ before the asterisk. reply vinaypai 14 hours agoprevTIL: Yahoo still exists in 2023 reply m4jor 7 hours agoparentMayer didn&#x27;t kill it off 100%, only like ~95%. reply cscurmudgeon 13 hours agoparentprevStill one of the top website reply orangepurple 13 hours agoparentprevYahoo search delivers superior search results for tech related queries despite supposedly using Bing reply lofaszvanitt 13 hours agorootparentPlus the best finance page. reply sundarurfriend 9 hours agorootparentprevsuperior search results as in better than Google? superior in any specific way or just generally more relevant results? reply danielheath 7 hours agorootparentKagi has shown me that “better than google” is not even particularly difficult, if such a small team can do it. reply happytiger 11 hours agoprevThis is fabulous and I’m very excited to see where this project goes.It definitely has legs and if the team understands just how enormous the potential could be, annd especially why they could disrupt, I’m even more eager to see what they do. reply gyehuda 10 hours agoprevVery excited to see this.

By Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards. Oct 4, 2023, 10:30 AM EDT|18 Comments / 18 New Share this story The Pixel 8 Pro in blue. Image: Google The Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro will be supported with seven years of “OS, security, and Feature Drop updates,” meaning buyers should be able to use them until 2030 before their software starts to become outdated. “You’ll receive the latest OS and security updates for 7 years, and new, helpful features with Feature Drops every few months,” Google’s blog post announcing the phones reads. Seven years of software support is a big step up compared to what Google has offered previously, which has been limited to five years of security updates and only three years of Android OS upgrades. It’s also a longer support period than what basically all of Google’s mainstream Android competitors are currently offering. Samsung, OnePlus, and Xiaomi are all promising four generations of Android version updates and five years of security updates for their latest flagships. The Pixel 8 in rose pink. Image: Google Google has the freedom to offer this longer support period thanks to using its own Tensor processor in the Pixel 8 series, which gives it more control over the hardware that’s gone into the phone compared to most of its Android competitors. Fairphone, a competing Android manufacturer that prioritizes lengthy support periods for its devices, has publicly spoken about how difficult it is to continue to support a phone after a chipset manufacturer like Qualcomm ends support for the processor used. In Google’s case with Tensor, the power is in its own hands. Apple, another manufacturer that also produces its own processors for its phones, offers similarly lengthy support periods. Although the company doesn’t promote explicit promises about the number of years it supports its devices for, it released five major iOS version updates for the 2017 iPhone X before ending support with iOS 17 this year. Even then, however, Apple will occasionally release security patches for older devices. In theory, Google’s pledge should mean the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro get updated to at least 2029’s Android 20 and maybe even 2030’s Android 21, depending on when in the year the update gets released. But that assumes Google is still using the same annual release cadence for Android seven years from now, even before we get into its somewhat flaky history of ongoing support for other services and initiatives. Although seven years of security support puts Google out ahead of its mainstream competitors, it’s still technically beaten by Fairphone, which recently announced the Fairphone 5 with a promised eight years of security updates (with 10 years as a stretch goal). However, Fairphone has no plans to sell its fifth-generation device in the US and is also only committed to releasing five major Android OS updates.

I&#x27;ve tried, several times. Fake, low-quality batteries are rampant (usually degrading within weeks), and genuine ones are prohibitively expensive -- usually a significant fraction of the cost of a new phone. reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agoparentThe other elephant in the room is that the EU is going to start mandating user-replaceable batteries in consumer electronics, and hopefully the US follows suit or big tech just decides to do it worldwide.I absolutely despise that Apple made non-replaceable batteries the norm, and most of us have begun to accept this as \"the way things have always been\". Every cell phone I had before the iPhone came out had an easily replaceable battery before we all became a slave to Ives&#x27; \"Preciousssss\" demands for minimalism.Edit: Folks seem to be misunderstanding why I brought up Apple. I in no way think they are now worse than any other phone manufacturer when it comes to irreplaceable batteries. But AFAIK the iPhone was the first phone to have a glued-in battery, and that has since become the norm. They have essentially helped lead the way in convincing consumers that replacing the battery shouldn&#x27;t be an easy, user-accessible operation. reply thiht 3 hours agorootparent> Every cell phone I had before the iPhone came out had an easily replaceable batteryI’m not sure how important it is. My first phones with replaceable batteries sucked, the plastic cover would always pop out and was generally a point of failure. And it never did me any good, as most phones died before the battery became an issue.Today I’ve had an iPhone for 3 years and the battery is still going strong. If I need to replace it… I’ll just find someone who can replace it, easy enough. Sure it would be more convenient to be able to do it myself, but if it happens once every 4-5 years I honestly don’t care, and will take the daily convenience of no plastic cover instead. reply jmspring 15 hours agorootparentprevIf the EU does mandate it, like USB-C we will see the corresponding iPhone release tout how they have the greenest batteries and an amazing (same number) X hours of batterylife, but only the greenest battery life.Snark aside and how most phones&#x2F;etc are put together these days, I see issues in the general population of replacing the battery if it requires opening the case. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agorootparent> Snark aside and how most phones&#x2F;etc are put together these days, I see issues in the general population of replacing the battery if it requires opening the case.Every phone (before the advent of eSims) used to come with a simple sim-opening tool that made it trivial to open the sim tray. I find it baffling to think that phone manufacturers would find it so difficult to add some teeny screws or other fasteners that could be easily opened with a 2 cent tool that would come with the phone. reply jmspring 15 hours agorootparentIt adds to the cost of goods and probably the manufacturing process. Yes, you used to be able to replace batteries easily. Most are long, thin & flat to go with slimmer phones. Possible, for sure, but we will see. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentApple is one of the most advanced consumer electronics companies on the planet. I may question its utility, but their VR headset is one of the most amazing feats of consumer product engineering I&#x27;ve ever seen. So excuse my scepticism if \"replaceable battery\" is somehow beyond their engineering and product design prowess. reply jmspring 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t doubt they would be able to do so. I think the choice of doing so, maintaining esthetics, and making it such that a layman can do it while not making tradeoffs they don&#x27;t want to probably play into it. replyscarface_74 15 hours agorootparentprevSo you’re blaming Apple - with 13% market share worldwide?And I kind of care about waterproof phones. Before you bring up the old Samsungs, if you didn’t put the battery on just right (and Samsung warned you about it), you would lose water resistance. reply eternityforest 13 hours agorootparentThey have a small marketshare but an oversized amount of trend setting power.I would imagine nonreplacable batteries would happen without them, but it does seem like every other brand copies whatever crap Apple decides to put out, especially the aesthetics. There are so many very obvious apple clone products. reply scarface_74 13 hours agorootparentAnd you blame Apple instead of the 87% of the market that can’t come up with better ideas and set “trends”? Including little companies like Google and Samsung?It really seems to infuriate geeks that normal people don’t have their same priorities.Out of the literally dozens of Android manufacturers, if that was something people wanted, wouldn’t someone make it? reply ToucanLoucan 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean it isn&#x27;t just minimalism. It makes waterproofing way easier and allows for sturdier construction in a smaller device when getting said device apart again isn&#x27;t really a priority.Also who in the world needs all this replacement batteries anyway? I&#x27;m still rocking a 13 Pro purchased when new, I have no plans to upgrade and my battery is bloody fine. I still end every day with a good 40% charge at minimum and I&#x27;m an app developer, so I&#x27;m on my phone for a good solid portion of every day. And prior to this one I had an X which not only didn&#x27;t have any major battery issues but my wife still used it for another year after I bought my 13, and then, near the tail end of her ownership, STARTED having some battery problems. At the end of year 4 of service as a daily driver. reply Night_Thastus 15 hours agorootparentSee, you made a good point at first and then ruined it. You are absolutely right about the benefits, but:>who in the world needs all this replacement batteries anyway>I&#x27;m still rocking a 13 Pro purchased when newCongratulations, your phone with a whopping 2-years of age still has a good battery. (Though I&#x27;m not sure losing 60% a day is really great imo...)Try living in a world where a $300 phone is a big expense, and now it barely lasts a day when it used to last a week.1: Some people have phones that are just fine, but have a dying battery. Replacing an otherwise perfectly functional phone just because the battery is going is massive e-waste.2: Not everyone can afford constantly replacing their ever-more-expensive phones just because the battery died. Even if they can, it&#x27;s a really wasteful use of money.Consumers should have the choice. They can get a product with some compromises, but a replaceable battery - or a potentially more durable, more waterproof phone without one.Of course they don&#x27;t bother because the demand is a vocal minority. Most people don&#x27;t care. But the e-waste effects everyone so something does need to be done. reply scarface_74 15 hours agorootparentOr you could just pay $70 for Apple or an authorized dealer to replace the battery after three years.Those same users don’t have to buy a $300 phone - which by the way is more than the average selling price of an Android phone - there are plenty of unsubsidized Android phones for less than $100. reply ToucanLoucan 15 hours agorootparentprev> Congratulations, your phone with a whopping 2-years of age still has a good battery. (Though I&#x27;m not sure losing 60% a day is really great imo...)Well again, I spend a lot of my day with my phone on and being used to do my job. And I also use it plenty for bathroom breaks, screwing around between tasks, the usual stuff. In my mind, running like that for 16 hours per day and still having 2&#x2F;5th&#x27;s in the tank is pretty good.> Try living in a world where a $300 phone is a big expense, and now it barely lasts a day when it used to last a week.I have never owned any smartphone that lasted even close to a week. When I was younger, my droid would occasionally go a couple of days between charges, if I was particularly busy and therefore not using it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve owned a phone I haven&#x27;t charged overnight since... gotta be like 2011?> 1: Some people have phones that are just fine, but have a dying battery. Replacing an otherwise perfectly functional phone just because the battery is going is massive e-waste.But again that&#x27;s what my question is getting at and what I&#x27;m trying to understand: how are people frying out their batteries like they are? reply wheels 11 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re not frying batteries quicker, we&#x27;re using our phones longer. The only reason I&#x27;d have to replace my 3.5 year old phone is that the battery is dying, but it probably doesn&#x27;t make sense to spend half the price of my phone (phone was only $200-ish) on a replacement. I just don&#x27;t have any qualms with my phone or have any particular reason to need a new one. I resent having to replace my phone because a part that could be easily user swapable at a reasonable price point isn&#x27;t.Your assumption that phones would only be used for 2 years is pretty weird on an article about using phones for 8 years. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agorootparentprev> Also who in the world needs all this replacement batteries anyway?Really?? I get that you personally may not see a need for this, but it takes special kind of blinders to pretend that your experience is universal. Tons of people want replaceable batteries. You&#x27;re welcome to talk to the iFixit folks if you need more evidence. reply ToucanLoucan 15 hours agorootparentMy question wasn&#x27;t do people want replacement batteries, they clearly do. My question is why they need them? I don&#x27;t understand how one person&#x27;s experience with a battery can be so much different than anothers. I would think, if anything, my usage of my phones in my day to day work would mean I&#x27;d be harder on phones than most people, not apparently easier. reply wffurr 13 hours agorootparentWhat I really want is to be able to replace my battery when it&#x27;s worn after after years of usage by undoing some screws and fiddling with a gasket. Trying to melt a ton of glue and pull out a glued-in battery without starting a fire is incredibly difficult and unnecessary. reply hn_throwaway_99 13 hours agorootparentprevCan&#x27;t comment on the details of your experience, but both my Pixel phones and iPhones (albeit earlier gen iPhones) all had significant, noticeable battery degradation between years 2 and 3. reply rat9988 14 hours agorootparentprevIn a world where Apple slows down your phone when battery is worn out and considers it fair. It should be fair too to have the ability to replace it. reply callalex 12 hours agorootparentprevBattery degradation is not linear. They tend to be fine until they fall off a cliff at the 2-3 year mark. You just haven’t gotten there yet. reply theshrike79 16 hours agorootparentprevHow is Apple to blame for non-replaceable batteries?It&#x27;s just the easiest way to construct a \"modern\" phone. Stick the battery in with a 3M Command Strip style sticker and it won&#x27;t move, construct phone around it.Having to add toolless latches while keeping some kind of IP rating AND not looking like a rugged phone is a whole different thing. reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agorootparent> How is Apple to blame for non-replaceable batteries?How quickly we forget history. I&#x27;m not going to say they were the absolute first to do this as I&#x27;m not doing a full survey of 2007 phones, but before that (a) there was not a single phone I or my friends had that didn&#x27;t have a simply replaceable battery and (b) there was a ton of conversation and press when the iPhone was first released about how unique the decision was to have a glued-in battery here.For contrast, here are instructions for replacing the battery on the famous Nokia 3310 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devices.vodafone.com.au&#x2F;nokia&#x2F;3310-2017-proprietary-....Let&#x27;s be real here: if having difficult-to-replace batteries was a money loser for Apple and other manufacturers, they would fix the situation in a heartbeat - it&#x27;s not like this is a hard problem. The only reason they do this is because of desired planned obsolescence - tons of people will think \"Oh, getting the battery changed is such a hassle, might as well get a new phone.\"Again, essentially every consumer electronic device pre-2007 (except maybe some Mac laptops?) had easily-replaceable batteries. Convincing people that using glued-in batteries was a necessary design change, instead of a corporate decision to make more money, was a real coup for corporate marketing. reply theshrike79 14 hours agorootparentThe 3310 has a literal IP rating of 00.Compared to a modern iPhone you can throw in a pool and dig out safely a few minutes later.Batteries post 2007 have gotten REALLY good, the capacity&#x2F;weight ratio has gone up so much that swapping batteries mid-day isn&#x27;t a thing people do. Drones weren&#x27;t a big thing in those times because you couldn&#x27;t get enough power to lift one up. Now a 249 gram DJI drone can fly ~45 minutes on a single battery that&#x27;s about the size of 2-3 matchboxes.I still remember the laptop I had around that time that had two batteries so that I could swap one and still keep it running with the other.On the other hand my current M2 MacBook lasts for two full workdays without charging easily, even more if I just sit in meetings and don&#x27;t do anything CPU&#x2F;GPU intensive. reply capitainenemo 14 hours agorootparentMy Samsung XCover6 pro has a replaceable battery and an IP68 rating. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be that hard to make the battery replaceable, you just keep it in a separate area from the rest of the water-tight electronics. reply Raed667 16 hours agorootparentprevfor 1k a piece they better figure it out reply theshrike79 16 hours agorootparentNow tell me about the $2k Samsung Fold and how user repairable that is: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ifixit.com&#x2F;Teardown&#x2F;Samsung+Galaxy+Fold+Teardown... reply hn_throwaway_99 15 hours agorootparent\"Back away from the tribalism.\" This is not an Apple v Google v Samsung issue.I&#x27;m in no way saying Google or Samsung is better in any way here, and in many ways Apple has improved their repairability scores over the past few years. The reason I highlighted Apple was because they really led the way in gluing down batteries everywhere, but the problem is definitely industry-wide now. reply Raed667 15 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Whataboutism replyalamortsubite 17 hours agoparentprevI replaced the batteries in my mom&#x27;s iPhone and dad&#x27;s Motorola at about the same time last year. I agree it should be easier to do, but it&#x27;s definitely not a losing proposition. They both turned out very well and costBesides the ease of battery replacement, those phones seemed much more durable. Maybe because there was something that gave way on impact?Metal cases give way, too— permanently. When they give way, they dent, shrinking the space available for the glass screen and, inevitably, cracking it.Glass cases&#x2F;backs obviously easily crack themselves.Making phone housings out of something other than plastic is an obviously stupid kind of fetishism for certain materials as hallmarks of a vague &#x27;quality&#x27; regardless of context.Idk about the screens. Do we need glass for touchscreens as we know them to work really well? Can they be brighter or something? Or are they largely unnecessary, too? reply vel0city 15 hours agorootparentThe big points of using a glass screen are durability from scratches and better surface feel over time. A large plastic screen is going to get all kinds of scratched up. reply HumblyTossed 16 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;d love a return to the old snap-fit plastic cases.I wish OEMs would do this as well. Polycarb is strong. Safety glasses are made out of it for a reason. Sure, it scratches, but so does glass. reply keybits 15 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;d love a return to the old snap-fit plastic cases.Fairphone is worth a look for this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.fairphone.com&#x2F;fairphone-5 reply theshrike79 16 hours agorootparentprevI still remember the age of snap-fit phones with replaceable color covers.When you dropped one, you had to dig at least 4 parts from around the room. Front & back covers, the battery and the rest of the phone all flew in different directions =) reply tshaddox 17 hours agorootparentprevWhen you refer to snap-fit plastic cases being more durable, I presume you&#x27;re not talking about water and dust resistance. reply faefox 17 hours agorootparentThe two aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive; for example the Samsung Galaxy XCover has a removable battery and an IP68 rating. reply adgjlsfhk1 16 hours agorootparentprevThe ideal design is to have a \"dry\" and \"wet\" side where you put the parts that need servicing on the wet side and the parts that don&#x27;t on the dry side (to the extent possible). Specifically, you want the battery and the charging port on the wet side since those the two most likely to break. Those can then connect via metal pins&#x2F;pads to the dry side which has the soc and all the expensive stuff that actually needs to stay dry. reply ianburrell 15 hours agorootparentWhat is the point of that? You drop phone in toilet and it stops working because the battery circuits are damaged, or the charging port is damaged. It might be cheaper to fix that way.Phones currently can be dropped in the toilet with zero damage. It is a real benefit to have waterproofing. I would prefer waterproofing over easily replacing battery that happens rarely. reply saltcured 14 hours agorootparentSo far, I&#x27;ve only ever replaced smartphones because they stopped getting software support or had a battery failure. Never dropped lost one to water damage. Never cracked a screen or otherwise broke one physically.Unless I forgot one, I think I&#x27;m on my 10th mobile phone in total since the late 1990s, so averaging just under 3 years per phone. And I think the interval was shorter in the feature phone days and longer in the last 12 years or so where I&#x27;m now on my 4th smartphone.Maybe it&#x27;s because I learned to be careful with my phones before smartphones existed, back when dropping it might mean the back cover, battery, and main body flying in different directions. As a result, I&#x27;m also the kind of person who might drop his phone&#x2F;wallet&#x2F;passport into ziplock bags if I was heading outside with a chance of significant rain... reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparent> Never dropped lost one to water damage. Never cracked a screen or otherwise broke one physically.Same here, but I don&#x27;t pretend that my experience is typical.Even if it is, and, say, only 20% of people end up dropping a phone in a toilet or cracking the screen, it seems worth it to build in water and crack resistance. reply everdrive 16 hours agorootparentprevSomehow I never had water or dust problems with any snap case device that’s had a battery, though. reply JohnBooty 16 hours agorootparentMaybe you never had an issue, but today&#x27;s phones are quite a bit more water resistant than the removable battery phones of yore. You can dunk them in water and you&#x27;re usually fine! iPhones, at least.I&#x27;m not sure dust was ever really a problem for most people. Although, for those in sandy&#x2F;dusty environments (deserts, some industrial situations, etc) I bet it was a problem.More to the point, though: I don&#x27;t think it has to be an either&#x2F;or choice. Casio makes a crapload of 200M water-resistant watches that sell for $50 or less. This includes both plastic (G-Shock, mostly) and full-metal models (MDV-106&#x2F;107). The secret is (gasp)... a frigging thin rubber gasket. I frankly don&#x27;t see any reason why we can&#x27;t have this level of water resistance in a phone.We would have to sacrifice thinness and lightness, but not by much. I think a lot of people would happily make that trade. reply saltcured 12 hours agorootparentWell, the second secret is having a very rigid and precise interface between the watch case and back cover so that the thin gasket remains under the correct amount of pressure everywhere around the joint. This has been optimized at the small size of a watch.On a larger object, this level of precision is harder to maintain. Due to spacing between fasteners or other flexing&#x2F;distortion of the body, the gasket could be overly compressed in some places and loose in others... reply vel0city 14 hours agorootparentprevI spent a significant chunk of my teenage income on phones because of water damage. Getting caught in a rainstorm, having the canoe tip over, have people be too rowdy with splashing around a pool, forgetting it in a pocket when going swimming, it falling off a dock were all times Ive personally lost a device. Every one of those would have been fine with my current phones and they&#x27;ve survived all that and more without issue. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even just rinse my phone under running water when the kids make it super nasty, it&#x27;s no problem.Similar thing with dust. Even though a lot of my phones in my teenage years lasted under a year, they always died with dust in their screens. Camping and riding bikes around dirt trails and what not can push a lot of gunk in those things.I&#x27;m happy phones are a lot better sealed. It&#x27;s a bit of a pain making it harder to swap the battery, but paying a shop $50 parts included to swap it and keep it sealed well is worth it to me. A replacement battery back then would have been like >$30 anyways, going by inflation that&#x27;s not too much increase in cost. reply alamortsubite 17 hours agorootparentprevNo, but I never had a problem with that, either. I kept my first phone (not the one I dropped at HD) for seven years and only retired it because my girlfriend gifted me hers. reply HumblyTossed 16 hours agorootparentprevNo reason you can&#x27;t have both. The battery would just be in it&#x27;s own compartment. reply initplus 16 hours agorootparentIf the compartment with the battery isn’t waterproof it’s not a waterproof phone. reply HumblyTossed 15 hours agorootparentWell, first of all, phones are most certainly not waterproof.Second, it&#x27;s possible to make the battery connections water resistant, so yes, you can have a water resistant phone AND have a replaceable battery in it&#x27;s own compartment. reply hollander 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can&#x27;t have it all reply JohnBooty 16 hours agorootparentRight.You can&#x27;t have the thinnest&#x2F;sleekest possible phone and an easily removable battery. Have to choose.Frustrating thing is, mainstream phone manufacturers don&#x27;t give you a choice. There&#x27;s no option to buy e.g. an a slightly more ruggedized iPhone that is 15% bulkier but gives you easy battery access. That&#x27;s a thing I&#x27;d buy, even if it cost a bit more.The quest for \"sleekness at all costs\" made more sense 15-20 years ago, when full-spec smartphones and laptops were clunkier.Hopefully the tide is turning. Apple is offering beefier and thicker laptops (M1&#x2F;M2 Macbook Pros) and likewise now gives buyers an option for a beefier \"Explorer Edition\" watch. No battery access sadly. But hopefully the pendulum might swing the other way a little now. reply sho_hn 16 hours agorootparent> Frustrating thing is, mainstream phone manufacturers don&#x27;t give you a choice.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;phones&#x2F;galaxy-xcover&#x2F;galax...Edit: This is getting downvoted, but it&#x27;s a regularly-updated phone line from a mainstream manufacturer with decent specs. You can absolutely vote with your wallet here as OP laid out. reply alamortsubite 15 hours agorootparentprev> You can&#x27;t have the thinnest&#x2F;sleekest possible phone and an easily removable battery.Is this true? Plastic covers seemed thinner than the glass&#x2F;metal shells that have replaced them. Also, from my limited experience, the batteries in the glued-together phones have adhesive strips that secure them inside the case, which again add a little extra thickness.I could be wrong about those things, but I stand by my assertion that the plastic snap-fit phones were more durable. Durable enough that they didn&#x27;t need cases for protection, which above all else rob a phone of its thinness&#x2F;sleekness.The first time I dropped a glued-together phone, I cracked the screen. I thought it must have been a fluke, since I&#x27;d dropped plastic phones tons and they&#x27;d always been fine. I was so sure it was a weird one-off I refused to get a case after having the screen replaced. My girlfriend called me an idiot. Two months later, I dropped the phone again. Now I have a case. reply tshaddox 12 hours agorootparentprev> There&#x27;s no option to buy e.g. an a slightly more ruggedized iPhone that is 15% bulkier but gives you easy battery access.

Why are some apps missing after every migration? Why do some apps just randomly lose all config and settings and force you to set them up again?Why indeed.A major part of the problem is instead of charting a coherent strategy for backups from the beginning, Google constantly changes their minds as to how it should work and what behavior is expected from users and app developers.Once upon a time a simple pair of adb backup and restore commands did the trick.Then they introduced the android:allowBackup=\"false\" app manifest flag[1], which silently breaks adb backup. (Yes, this got me once, resulting in lost data). That effectively wrenched sovereignty over your data out of your hands and shifted its control into the hands of app publishers, many of whom couldn&#x27;t be bothered to change defaults. There are also limits (e.g. even when enabled, I gather Google&#x27;s cloud only allows 25MB of data per app). I think more recently it&#x27;s been enhanced with a flag that allows backups only if encrypted.All this degraded the user experience upgrading phones, so they carved out a Google-only exception in the form of a Device-to-Device (D2D) transfer process which has the privilege of totally ignoring the flag (so it can capture apps that advertise themselves as do-not-backup). But I&#x27;ve never seen a means of triggering that process without first being forced to turn on backups to Google servers[2], and allowing Google Play services to collect data like your email address.It&#x27;s a horrible state of affairs that makes it impossible for third-party solutions like SeedVault to work reliably (to the point where users have suggested bastardizing&#x2F;impersonating D2D to bypass the restrictions[3][4]).I don&#x27;t understand why anti-trust efforts aren&#x27;t examining lock-in like this, which forces you to use Google&#x27;s cloud instead of your own, and intentionally creates an unequal playing field for competitors whose clouds you might trust more. It causes real harm to users like me.The only reliable method is rooting your phone, which recovers your sovereignty and allows apps like Titanium to bypass all this nonsense. I suspect that&#x27;s a major reason some people still choose to root, despite all the security warnings against it. Of course depending on what exactly you&#x27;re backing up you can still run into issues if restoring to a different model phone or version of the OS (although in the past I&#x27;ve had some success surgically extracting the desired records via a sqlite explorer).I wish someone would compile a flavour of Android with a Developer Option that undoes or ignores the effects of android:allowBackup. Depending on your viewpoint that would \"break the Android security model\", or fix it.Some users have even resorted to decompiling their app&#x27;s stock APK, patching android:allowBackup to true, self-signing and recompiling [5], which I presume would have to be done after every app update (maybe there&#x27;s a niche market opportunity for a service that automates this).If I created a mobile device platform I&#x27;d make darn sure critical functions like backup, restore, migration, maintaining \"hot standby\" devices, etc. just work(tm), seamlessly and reliably, out of the box. The architecture would make it easy and simple (instead of difficult and convoluted) for developers to ensure user data is captured (incidentally the normalized Palm pdb system didn&#x27;t do a bad job of that), provide tools and examples of how to maintain forward compatibility, and generally funnel developers into good habits. It&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve but I&#x27;m convinced it can be done with 100X more elegance. And users would have the power to backup to wherever they choose, with an easy way to custody their own encryption keys (with peer-to-peer recovery models e.g. X of Y friends or commercial-designates).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;12648373&#x2F;what-is-android...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;android&#x2F;answer&#x2F;6193424?hl=en[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seedvault-app&#x2F;seedvault&#x2F;issues&#x2F;165[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seedvault-app&#x2F;seedvault&#x2F;pull&#x2F;562[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackpointer.io&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;android-enable-adb-backup-for... reply nfriedly 8 hours agoparentprevI had pretty good experience with replacing the battery in a pixel 2 with one from iFixit.On the other hand, the iPod touch battery that I got off eBay only lasted about 6 months before refused to charge. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 18 hours agoparentprevI suppose it depends on how long they sell this model.

People who paid for it are still getting what they paid for through the end of their subscription, although because the program is not continuing, your subscription will end at the end of two years. In other words, the Pixel Pass was more or less equivalent to Google&#x27;s existing 0% APR financing (which is still offered, including on the Pixel 8!). The only difference is that the Pixel Pass autorenewed at the end of 24 months, whereas otherwise you have to manually reorder the next phone with the financing offer[0].That&#x27;s different from not delivering the product&#x2F;service that customers have paid for.The promise of 7 years of updates is legally binding. If Google promises 7 years of updates, and then doesn&#x27;t deliver those, that will be a violation of both state and federal law (California is now requiring 7 years of updates, and it is additionally a violation of federal law to advertise a product with a service, sell that product, and then fail to deliver that service).[0] The 0% APR financing offer is actually now slightly better than the Pixel Pass, because on the Pixel 8 it&#x27;s now amortized over 3 years instead of two (which is new - previously it was amortized over 2 years). reply ShakataGaNai 15 hours agoparentprevIn general, yes, but google specifically, no.

It was a problem on all Android brands (some haven&#x27;t improved yet).With this said, updates on Android are different from iOS updates. Things like the browser, camera, gallery, etc, are updated via the app store, so your Pixel 5 still runs the latest Chrome and will continue to do so for years. They can also update system components (media engine, bluetooth, etc) via Play Store updates. Many new features (covid app support, earthquake alerts, etc) are backported via the Play services. On iOS all this requires a system update, on Android it doesn&#x27;t.This new Pixel 8 has 7 years of support, which is in line with the 6 or 7 years iPhones get. At least from now on Pixels should be as good as iPhones. reply usea 15 hours agorootparentprevAlthough I do think google will probably follow through with their support claim, at least in some technical way.

Zero people have already known about it. The most common reaction is that I am just mistaken, they would never do that. reply burkaman 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s very frustrating. The phone works perfectly well and probably will for years, and it would be incredibly wasteful to buy a new one now, but at some point it will be irresponsible to keep using a phone that hasn&#x27;t gotten security updates in years. I would never have bought it if they advertised a 2.5 year lifetime (and obviously they knew that). reply youngtaff 13 hours agorootparentprevYou may be right but it doesn’t make it any less shit than Google obsoletes perfectly good phones by not providing security updates for them reply celsoazevedo 12 hours agorootparentAndroid took longer to catch iOS on full system updates, probably because it was hard to keep it up-to-date.Google itself used to offer 3 years of support. The last 2 generations of Pixels have 5 years. This new phone is 7 years, which is in line with Apple&#x27;s 6-7 years.Parts of the system are also kept up-to-date via the app store. Apple released a system update not long ago for older iPhones just to fix a WebKit exploit... Google would release that as an app update, you wouldn&#x27;t even have to restart the phone. Any Android running a 7 year old OS (Android 7) is still running the latest version of Chrome. On newer Android versions, parts of the system - from the media engine to the bluetooth stack - can also be updated via the store.Are Android updates messier than iOS? Yes they are. But a lot of what&#x27;s considered to be \"system updates\" on iOS are just app&#x2F;module updates on Android.

Is this just a cash grab from Google, or is there more to it? reply sowbug 7 hours agorootparentUntil recently, Qualcomm provided BSPs (binary support packages) including the kernel for Google phones. For whatever reason -- possibly that their one and only corporate purpose is to sell as many chips as possible -- Qualcomm only briefly updated their packages for chips they no longer sold.Google updates as much of the Android ecosystem as it can. First-party Play Store apps, system webview... if you look at the normally hidden system apps on your phone you&#x27;ll see that the Android team has \"unbundled\" many parts of the formerly monolithic system to allow updates to as much of it as possible even if the kernel is marooned at an older version.Unfortunately, some bugs are in the kernel or drivers, so there&#x27;s nothing any Android OEM (including Google) can do if their chipset vendor won&#x27;t do the (admittedly non-revenue-generating) engineering to update that firmware. And eventually the system itself requires newer kernel features, so there&#x27;s a limit to how far back Google or other OEMs can reasonably backport a newer version of Android.This is part of why Google&#x27;s recent phones are based on Google-designed, non-Qualcomm chipsets. It was a truly Herculean effort to scrub the Pixel line of Qualcomm, and especially of Qualcomm&#x27;s incentives to abandon still-good phone hardware in order to sell more chipsets.Your PC&#x27;s OS distribution is nearly totally open-source, and the economic incentives for the Linux ecosystem are completely different from Qualcomm&#x27;s.

Subscribe Continue reading Sign in Eliminating Radio Interference from Apple charger Apple's product design teams should do a better job eliminating unwanted radio frequency emissions from their product! OSSI HERRALA SEP 14, 2023 3 1 Share Manufacturers are cutting corners to save costs. In today’s story our shared radio waves are one of the victims of poor design choices. Sadly Apple has joined the club by skipping a crucial component on their wireless “Apple MagSafe Charger”. I bought this forementioned charger and mounted it into my car. Wireless charging and being able to use phone as a navigator was a tempting option. However, when I also had my amateur radio handheld tranceiver inside with me monitoring the local frequencies I noticed the scan stopping on 2m band (145 MHz) and awful noise was getting through the squelch. This radio interference was also present on the aviation frequencies (around 124 MHz). We can assume this is a problem for every VHF radio user. The offending device causing major radio frequency interference Bit of Theory The wireless charging (Apple’s Magsafe as well as other chargers implementing Qi charger specification) works with radio frequency to produce magnetic field. The flat circle where you connect your phone is a coil and a high frequency signal (105—205 kHz) is pushed into it making the coil radiate magnetic field which in turn is then captured by the device to be charged and turned into electricity. And when there’s a high frequency signal the connecting cables can start to act like antennas which radiate both the fundamental frequency as well as many harmonics of it. Red circles indicate the most offending frequencies in the displayed radio spectrum, but the interference was also present outside these most offending spikes. The Solution The ultimately best solution is not to buy this piece of crap and demand loudly that manufacturers properly shield their products in the first place. However, I have already bought this product and the other pieces for my car mount. So I was invested. I accepted the challenge to learn something new and try eliminate this issue. Maybe Apple’s design team can get some good ideas from this article. One way for damping the offending interference is to use a component called ferrite bead. The offending wire which is working as an antenna is wrapped around a correctly selected ferrite bead until the problem is gone. My research led me to order a snap-on ferrite of mix 31 (costing 2.21€, details below) and wrapping the charger’s USB wire three times around it. I could wrap the cable five times, but then the remaining cable is quite short. The final product showing the ferrite bead with three wraps of the interference causing USB cable around it. The Results It is not worth it to try eliminate the interference fully. It might also be next to impossible. But good enough results can be achieved by dampening the problematic frequencies enough. And enough for me was when I could no longer reproduce the issue with my handheld radio. We can also compare the screenshots below to screenshots above and notice that the largest spikes have been lowered down. The Mix 31 Ferrites come in different flavors and choosing the correct mix is crucial to achieve the wanted results. I spent good amount of time searching the world wide web reading as much as possible and diving into product specifications to learn even more. My quest was to find a product which has the most impedance on our offending frequency (145 MHz). The higher the impedance in our use case, the more dampening we’ll get. I chose Fair-Rite snap-on ferrite part number 0431167281 for this interference (as well as others in the future). The datasheet of this product contains the following graph: Source: https://fair-rite.com/product/round-cable-snap-its-431167281/ and we focus our eyes to frequencies between 100—200 MHz and specifically to around 145 MHz as indicated by red circle in the diagram. N=1, N=2, N=3 means how many wraps we have around the ferrite bead and in our case we had three, but two might be enough if we trust manufacturer’s specifications. In the graph we see that our impedance is already going down fast but it is still about 1000 ohms. And my lab experiments showed me that the problem was eliminated. But it really bothers me to buy 40€ product and I still need to fix it with component costing over 2€. I expect Apple could solve this problem with much cheaper and hidden it somewhere cleverly.

What&#x27;s it&#x27;s FCC approval number? Who tested this thing? Want to look that up.If RF got outside the charger and into the USB cable, it&#x27;s very badly designed. The power in the USB cable is DC. There shouldn&#x27;t be any significant RF component. There should be ferrite beads and capacitors in the power supply to deal with this. When the filtering is close to the switcher, it&#x27;s much easier to deal with the noise, and very small ferrite beads, available in surface mount, can usually do the job. Once it gets out on an external wire, it&#x27;s hard to filter.This is an old problem for Apple.

At VHF, that would be about -100dBm; or about 100 femto-watts. I presume that the charger is pretty near the radio. With free-space path loss being inverse square law, it&#x27;s essentially going to be completely negligible within a very short distance.Oh, and if the antenna is indeed near the charger (say within one wavelength, 2 meters in this case) it might be inside the near-field - which means that you&#x27;re getting additional power transferred that wouldn&#x27;t be reaching the far-field, and you might even be affecting the behavior of the device due to coupling.Looking at the FCC report, the radiated emissions are totally in-line with FCC Class B requirements.Modern ham radio equipment has exquisitely sensitive receivers and you easily hear all kinds of interference from digital devices that are completely Part 15 compliant. The prevalence of switched mode power supplies literally everywhere has made HF radio completely unusable for many people outside rural areas. reply amatecha 13 hours agorootparentI use HF radio all the time from inside my home, in the middle of one of the densest cities in BC. Within the past few weeks I&#x27;ve made contacts with stations in Alaska, Belize, Costa Rica, Colombia, Russia and Japan with a radio inside my home in Vancouver, Canada. HF is 10000% usable in urban areas. It&#x27;s not optimal or perfect, but it&#x27;s just fine. reply jrockway 12 hours agorootparentMaking the contact is easy (the interference you hear doesn&#x27;t exist at the receiver), hearing the other end is hard. Most of my indoor QSOs are people running 1500W FT8 which is ... an unnecessary amount of power.

Outside antenna , with a shielded feed in cable would also reduce interference from these devices like small power supplies that just produce interfearance to a few meters distance ??? reply kaishiro 2 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who has always been interested in getting into ham radio - do you have any pointers on where to start or what to avoid? reply MandieD 1 hour agorootparentFirst of all, get your entry-level license. If you&#x27;re in the US (or have someone who can receive mail for you), this is relatively easy and inexpensive, and can be done completely online.Avoid sinking a lot of money into a transceiver immediately before you&#x27;ve been operating for awhile and know what you&#x27;re really interested in doing. You also do not need a rooftop antenna for HF (3-30 MHz; the frequencies that most often travel far) - a wire across your backyard can be quite effective.Since you&#x27;re here, I recommend getting started with digital modes like WSPR and FT8. They require a lot less power to make some surprising connections, and will teach you a lot about how propagation works and adjusting antennas, and because of the low power requirements, can be done with relatively inexpensive equipment. Some \"old timers\" grouch about how they&#x27;re not \"real\" ham radio, but ignore them.Edited to add: A good starting point that doesn&#x27;t even require a license is to get an SDR receiver like the RTL-SDR and hook a long wire to it as an antenna, then listen for WSPR or FT8 signals with WSJT-X, and whatever else (other digital modes, Morse Code) with fldigi. reply matthews2 1 hour agorootparentprevJoin a local club! reply t0mas88 13 hours agorootparentprevNear-field being as big as 2 meters from the charger can be quite relevant for use in aircraft. Since on a narrow-body aircraft passengers can easily be within 2 meters of some of the VHF antennae.On the other hand, aviation voice radios aren&#x27;t very sensitive and navigation radios have filtering built-in. So the output of an Apple charger is probably some orders of magnitude too small to cause any issues. reply jrockway 12 hours agorootparent> Since on a narrow-body aircraft passengers can easily be within 2 meters of some of the VHF antennae.But, separated by a very large piece of conductive metal. (I think even carbon fiber planes have a conductive layer in there, to prevent damage from lightning strikes.) reply skykooler 11 hours agorootparentIsn’t carbon fiber conductive itself? reply thenickdude 8 hours agorootparentYes, and blocks radio transmissions very nicely. When making a model airplane with a carbon fibre hull, we have to add a plain fibreglass or plastic window for the antenna to receive through. reply tonyarkles 9 hours agorootparentprevCarbon fibre is definitely conductive. A couple of years ago I measured a 1” diameter tube and got about 15ohms&#x2F;ft. reply Animats 2 hours agorootparentRight, it&#x27;s a resistor. This is a problem for airframes and wind turbine blades. Its resistance is too high to deal well with lightning. So aluminum is needed to provide a conductive path. replycrote 13 hours agorootparentprevDo you have any idea how that power compares to regular FM radio broadcasts, which are somewhat close in frequency?Is this something a regular radio would detect, or is OP just trying to listen to a handheld radio half a continent away using a really sensitive receiver with the volume knob turned all the way up? reply amatecha 13 hours agorootparentDue to proximity, the interference from the charger is comparable to what the receiver was expecting from a normal signal (like an amateur radio repeater or fellow operator&#x27;s station), which is why his radio broke squelch while scanning. Because the radio is relatively close to the charger, the RFI is picked up quite well.Comparing to a broadcast FM station, the strength of the RFI as observed by any nearby radio will be trivial by comparison. Broadcast stations are some of the highest-power radio transmissions around us, typically thousands of kilowatts (for example the rock station near me transmits at an ERP of 51,000 watts[0]). You will hear this station clearly no matter what kind of nearby RFI is present, and the receiver&#x27;s AGC will reduce RF gain to probably as low as it goes. By comparison, amateur radios typically operate in the range of 5-100 watts. Thus you might gather that comparing localized RFI to broadcast stations is not a meaningful comparison.[0]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;CFOX-FM reply FireBeyond 8 hours agorootparent> Broadcast stations are some of the highest-power radio transmissions around us, typically thousands of kilowatts (for example the rock station near me transmits at an ERP of 51,000 watts[0]).I don&#x27;t think so.Not \"thousands of killowatts\" transmitted. Your example is as you say, an ERP of 51kW.But even ERP doesn&#x27;t refer to the transmitter. An ERP of 51,000W is most likely a 5-10kW transmitter, with a gain factor of 5-10. reply TylerE 7 hours agorootparentBack in the pirate radio days 100 and 250kw transmitters were common.Back in the &#x27;30s a few AM stations ran at 500kw, and could be picked up on other continents. reply NovemberWhiskey 13 hours agorootparentprevTo get a very broad idea: if you had perfectly efficient but isotropic antennas (you don&#x27;t) this would be about the power level you&#x27;d get receiving a typical 3W hand-held radio signal at 140MHz from 1,000 kilometers away. This is why you can talk to the International Space Station easily enough with vanilla ham radio equipment.Or, taking a notoriously powerful FM radio station like KRUZ 103.3, it would be like hearing that station from perhaps 300,000 kilometers away.Most loss is not free-space loss though - it&#x27;s due to reflections from man made objects and absorption into the earth that results in line-of-sight effects at these frequencies. reply amatecha 13 hours agorootparentHow did you come to that estimation? The strength of the RFI on the waterfall suggests received signal strength comparable to someone transmitting on a 5w HT within, say, 5-10 miles (aka not in the immediate neighbourhood, but pretty nearby).

Without any filtering, there would be huge spikes in the DC across C1-C2. But it didn&#x27;t take much filtering to fix that. There&#x27;s a small ferrite bead at L2, and an RC filter at the snubber at R1-C7. The back to back Zeners are to absorb inductive kickback from the output electromagnet. That&#x27;s the output side. On the input side, there&#x27;s more noise suppression, to prevent injecting noise back into the USB power source, which is usually a laptop here. Note L1 and C12.

I clicked through your PCB there. I would highly recommend you read a couple books on circuit design. You have a 2 layer PCB with no ground plane and you aren&#x27;t routing ground, signals passing parallel with each other on adjacent layers, you have mixed analog and digital domain, massively long traces where they could be shortened with a small jumpers.Worst offender is you aren&#x27;t using a ground plane or routing a return path. You might be under the impression that your signal travels on the copper you routed for the signal - it does not. It travels mostly in a magnetic field between your copper signal and the closest signal of largest difference. Which in your case is only sometimes going to be your ground trace.Short version... I would not use this as any sort of example for RF performance, at all anywhere, ever, and I&#x27;m being a nice as possible on that. I bet if you made a quick loop with an oscilloscope it would off the charts in reality. This would never pass FCC background.EDIT: I see this was 7 years ago, but I would not use that as an example. At a very minimum if you are still making circuits... Watch every Phil&#x27;s Lab video from 1 to 100. But somewhere in 50s is a good one on stack ups and signal returns.EDIT2: While I&#x27;m picking you apart, which you implictitly asked for, your board is HUGE. So who cares how large L1 and C12 are? On that note, I could almost not find L1 at all, the schematic is a bit of a mess. KiCad is great and now allows for global and bussed component blocks I would recommend.

If things had to go faster, there would be a proper ground plane. The tiny area around the switching IC did require careful layout (it just follows the Linear Technology data sheet) but the rest doesn&#x27;t matter much.There is no one ground. The 120VDC side has an HV ground, and the 5VDC side has a ground. The important point is to have separation between the two. reply SV_BubbleTime 5 hours agorootparent> nothing faster than 300kThat is exactly one of the misunderstandings I’m trying to warn that you are missing.I’m certain that your switching transition times are massively faster than the 300k period (each rise and fall time).You can have split grounds, but you don’t have traces under your grounds so in many cases you aren’t even effectively using them. You are grounding a portion of every signal inside every other signal trace.“The rest doesn’t matter much”… my man, I can’t explain in this form just how wrong you are.It’s one thing to be wrong on a design from years ago.

It’s spelled out in the text.The only reason the author had a problem is they put it right next to, quite literally, a highly sensitive receiver tuned to the exact frequency. It doesn’t mean the device was exceeding FCC limits, it means the ham operator needed to carefully set up their environment more tightly then even the FCC limits. reply tzs 3 hours agorootparent> Part of the FCC certification process is that devices need to accept interference from other devices operating within the limitsNote that only some classes of device have this requirement to accept all interference from devices operating within the limits. For some classes of devices if a consumer device interferes with then the consumer device&#x27;s owner is responsible for stopping the interference even if the consumer device is operating entirely within limits.The FCC regulations are divided into several parts, covering different devices and services. For example Part 87 covers various aviation radio services and devices, Part 97 covers Amateur Radio, and Part 20 covers mobile phones.For any given frequency there might be devices or services covered under several different parts that can radiate on that frequency. There will generally be some kind of hierarchy among them where devices are not allowed to interfere with devices higher in the hierarchy and must accept interference from devices higher in the hierarchy.The Part that covers much of consumer electronics other than mobile phones is Part 15. For most common consumer devices, if it is not a mobile phone and you did not need to get a license from the FCC to use it it probably falls under Part 15. This includes \"intentional radiators\", which are devices that are intended to emit radio such as WiFi routers, \"unintentional radiators\", which are devices that intentionally generate radio frequency energy within the device but it is meant to stay within wires or within the device, and \"incidental radiators\", which are devices that aren&#x27;t intended to generate radio frequency energy but do so as a side effect such as DC motors and mechanical light switches.Part 15 is at the bottom of the hierarchy.For Part 15 devices, 47 CFR 15.5(b) says:> Operation of an intentional, unintentional, or incidental radiator is subject to the conditions that no harmful interference is caused and that interference must be accepted that may be caused by the operation of an authorized radio station, by another intentional or unintentional radiator, by industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) equipment, or by an incidental radiator.Other Parts can have quite different rules. For example Part 95 Subpart C, which covers radio control such as is commonly used in RC models, says this:> (a) RCRS stations must not cause interference to:> (1) Authorized radio operations in the 72–76 MHz band, including radio remote control of industrial equipment on the same or adjacent channels; or,> (2) Broadcast television reception on TV Channels 4 or 5.> (b) RCRS operations are not afforded protection from interference caused by the operation of:> (1) Industrial, scientific or medical devices (see part 18 of this chapter) operating in the 26–28 MHz band; and,> (2) Fixed and mobile stations in other services operating on the same or adjacent channels.For Amateur (\"ham\") Radio, the interference rules are much more extensive, because hams are authorized to use a lot of frequency bands that overlap other services.

We&#x27;re talking about nanowatts, at most, here. reply Clamchop 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not Apple&#x27;s job to determine if there&#x27;s a problem with that and regulations on this issue are, so far as I&#x27;m aware, treated very seriously. reply pnpnp 13 hours agorootparentSorry - I can clarify a little. If it complies with regulations, Apple is definitely not at fault.I was just replying to the above comment which could read “a little noise from a single device isn’t a big deal.”It is definitely up to regulators to decide what is acceptable, and up to Apple to meet those regulations. It’s still a little unclear from the OP whether or not the spurious emissions meet transmission requirements, but it definitely a good place to do further lab tests for compliance. reply TylerE 6 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re talking \"little\" as in \"need a powerful microscope to see it\", not \"small\". reply Clamchop 11 hours agorootparentprevMaybe! Seems a little unlikely that Apple could fly something like that under the radar, not for very long, but mistakes happen.Do bodies like the FCC independently verify compliance? replyterr-dav 14 hours agorootparentprevThe author&#x27;s minimal effort was facilitated by his access to specialized equipment and time researching the issue.And as others have mentioned, Apple could have placed a small ferrite on the power supply PCB to achieve the same effect. reply oherrala 4 hours agorootparent> The author&#x27;s minimal effortThe minimal effort included hours of studying electrical engineering and radio technology at university including all the math and physics needed. Studying for amateur radio license. And after founding this issue delving deep into radio interference literature and datasheets of various components. Then setting up a test environment to replicate the issue and do tests trying to eliminate the interference. After a success write a blog post describing the solution in short and hopefully interesting way. reply mordae 11 hours agorootparentprevIt coincides with several frequencies used by air traffic control in my country. I don&#x27;t think it would be noticeable, but it still rises the noise floor. It&#x27;s not that hard to wave a piece of nicked coax over such gadget and I expect Apple to have a 200 MHz scope to connect the coax to and see if there are any peaks in the problematic bands that might need filtering. reply teaearlgraycold 15 hours agoparentprevForm over function. reply Clamchop 14 hours agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t read as correct in this case, as a bulky and heavy \"bead\" on the cable makes the product less functional for the purposes of most customers.The author has different priorities but they&#x27;re idiosyncratic. reply exabrial 13 hours agoprevSeems like an FCC complaint is in order reply chankstein38 14 hours agoprev [–] >But it really bothers me to buy 40€ product and I still need to fix it with component costing over 2€Honestly doesn&#x27;t surprise me.

Eliminating QOL things doesn&#x27;t just automatically equal improvement. reply 90-00-09 14 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s not analogous. Not including the charger in newer iPhones actually reduced e-waste for me personally. I have collected many charges over the years and don&#x27;t need more. When a device fails or I trade it in - I keep the charger (as most people I would think).Perhaps they should have made the charger optional... but completely agree overall with the decision not to include it. reply bdav2418 14 hours agorootparentI would agree that its fine to not include it, had they not switched to usb-c right when they stopped including bricks so all my new devices came with usb-c chargers but I only have usb-a bricks reply artimaeis 14 hours agorootparentiPhones stopped shipping with power bricks with the iPhone 12 back in 2020, so it&#x27;s not exactly new that they&#x27;re not including the charging brick.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;21514480&#x2F;apple-iphone-ch... reply lxgr 14 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, they did include a USB-C charger with the iPhone 11 for one year. But yeah, people on a two-year upgrade (or longer) cadence will likely not have had an Apple USB-C power adapter included with any of their devices. reply kalleboo 3 hours agorootparentOnly the Pro models, the base model still came with a 5W A brick reply twiceaday 14 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t want a cheap charging brick with my $1,200 phone. And I don&#x27;t want to pay more for a nice brick to be included either because I already have one. Good bricks outlive phones. No brick is much better. Buy whatever brick you need whenever you need it.The only argument is \"well, then they should have dropped the price of the phone.\" Okay dropped it relative to what? \"Obviously relative to last year&#x27;s price.\" Why? There is&#x2F;was heavy inflation and other products became more expensive but the iPhone didn&#x27;t. At most you are complaining about shrinkflation. reply colechristensen 13 hours agoparentprevI have a box full of various Apple chargers.

The older gen chargers are E-waste either way, and apple gets to charge us for something they should have included. reply lxgr 14 hours agorootparentUSB Power Delivery has been pretty stable; even my oldest charger, bought in 2017, is capable of fast charging the latest iPhone and Android devices – except for those exclusively using some proprietary \"fast charge\" crap (which is strongly discouraged by the USB-C specification). reply ProfessorLayton 14 hours agorootparentprevNot that I endorse cutting more corners, but I personally gave away the 30w dual USBC charger that came with my MacBook Air since I already own plenty of higher powered ones that work with other devices like my work MBP and Nintendo Switch etc.I think it&#x27;d be great if Apple offered a small discount for opting out of unnecessary items. reply artimaeis 14 hours agorootparentprevOlder gen chargers didn&#x27;t just become e-waste suddenly because newer bricks that support faster charging are available. I&#x27;ve still got a couple of the 5W USB-A bricks sitting around that I like for slow-charging devices. reply kalleboo 3 hours agorootparentpreviPhone fast charging hasn&#x27;t really changed over the years, it&#x27;s still only 25W max, which can be satisfied even by early USB PD chargers.Androids have their fancy ~100W fast charging where all of the charge controlling is in the brick for thermal reasons and those require special proprietary chargers that become obsolete after a generation, but Apple doesn&#x27;t do that. reply bartvk 14 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know the percentage of course, but I think you&#x27;ll agree that at least part of the client base will simply reuse their existing charger. reply hellotheretoday 13 hours agorootparentprevThat doesn’t mean they have chargers that meet the wattage and port needs of newer phones. I still use an iPhone XS Max, which uses a 5 watt usb a charger. If I upgrade to an iPhone 15 I will need to get an usb a to c cable and the phone will take forever to charge. I don’t even know if that wattage is enough to charge the phone while it’s on, especially with the pro models.Or they could just include a 20 watt usb c charger with my $800-1200+tax and activation fees phone and not force me to spend another $60 on their power adapter. though to be fair a third party option would certainly be less expensive. reply ZekeSulastin 11 hours agorootparentprev [–] It’s amusing that you’re getting downvoted when that was the entire point of forcing Apple to standardize on USB-C like the rest of the electronics industry. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Anna’s Blog Updates about Anna’s Archive. 1.3B Worldcat scrape & data science mini-competition annas-blog.org, 2023-10-03 TL;DR: Anna’s Archive scraped all of Worldcat (the world’s largest library metadata collection) to make a TODO list of books that need to be preserved, and is hosting a data science mini-competition. A year ago, we set out to answer this question: What percentage of books have been permanently preserved by shadow libraries? Once a book makes it into an open-data shadow library like Library Genesis, and now Anna’s Archive, it gets mirrored all over the world (through torrents), thereby practically preserving it forever. To answer the question of which percentage of books has been preserved, we need to know the denominator: how many books exist in total? And ideally we don’t just have a number, but actual metadata. Then we can not only match them against shadow libraries, but also create a TODO list of remaining books to preserve! We could even start dreaming of a crowdsourced effort to go down this TODO list. We scraped ISBNdb, and downloaded the Open Library dataset, but the results were unsatisfactory. The main problem was that there was not a ton of overlap of ISBNs. See this Venn diagram from our blog post: We were very surprised by how little overlap there was between ISBNdb and Open Library, both of which liberally include data from various sources, such as web scrapes and library records. If they both do a good job at finding most ISBNs in out there, their circles surely would have substantial overlap, or one would be a subset of the other. It made us wonder, how many books fall completely outside of these circles? We need a bigger database. Worldcat That is when we set our sights on the largest book database in the world: Worldcat. This is a proprietary database by the non-profit OCLC, which aggregates metadata records from libraries all over the world, in exchange for giving those libraries access to the full dataset, and having them show up in end-users’ search results. Even though OCLC is a non-profit, their business model requires protecting their database. Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away. :-) Over the past year, we’ve meticulously scraped all Worldcat records. At first, we hit a lucky break. Worldcat was just rolling out their complete website redesign (in Aug 2022). This included a substantial overhaul of their backend systems, introducing many security flaws. We immediately seized the opportunity, and were able scrape hundreds of millions (!) of records in mere days. Worldcat redesign After that, security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago. By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records. So we felt it is time to release! Let’s look at some basic information on the data: Format? Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC), which is essentially JSON Lines compressed with Zstandard, plus some standardized semantics. These containers wrap various types of records, based on the different scrapes we deployed. Where? On the torrents page of Anna’s Archive. We can’t link to it directly from here. Filename: annas_archive_meta__aacid__worldcat__20231001T025039Z--20231001T235839Z.jsonl.zst.torrent. Size? 220GB compressed, 2.2TB uncompressed. 1.3 billion unique IDs (1,348,336,870), covered by 1.8 billion records (1,888,381,236), so 540 million duplicates (29%). 600 million are redirects or 404s, so 700 million unique actual records. Is that a lot? Yes. For comparison, Open Library has 47 million records, and ISBNdb has 34 million. Anna’s Archive has 125 million files, but with many duplicates, and most are papers from Sci-Hub (98 million). What? Worldcat library records, merged from ~30,000 OCLC member libraries. Mostly books, but also magazines, journals, dissertations, physical artifacts, and so on. We only captured the records themselves, not holding information (e.g. which library has which items). Scraping quality? This varies between our different collection methods. The vast majority of records are “Title JSON”, which contains a good amount of information. There are some records we only managed to scrape through bulk HTML searches, containing only basic information like title, author, and ISBN. Primary key? The IDs of Worldcat records are known as “OCLC IDs”, and appear to be incrementing numbers, ranging from 1 to (when we started our scrape) about 1,350,000,000, which is the range we scraped for. However, due to how some of our scraping methods work, we also found other ranges, that seem different from the main set starting at 1. Examples? Canoncial URLs of these records are of the form worldcat.org/oclc/:id, which currently redirects to worldcat.org/title/:id. For example, https://worldcat.org/oclc/528432361. Competition Before we dive into the data, we have to acknowledge that we haven’t had a chance yet to dive very deep into this massive dataset. That’s why we’re inviting the world to have a go at it, in a mini-competition. We’re curious what you will discover! The 3 best submissions by 2023-12-01 will win a year-long membership of Anna’s Archive at the highest tier (“Amazing Archivist”), which includes the ability to include your own name or message in one of our torrent filenames. We will also feature your work in a blog post. For this mini-competition, anything goes, as long as you share your analysis publicly, e.g. in an open source repository or notebook. Send your submissions to AnnaArchivist@proton.me. We will pick the three submissions we think are most interesing, inspiring, and insightful. Join us in the devs & translators Telegram group to discuss what you’re working on! And check out our data imports scripts, for comparing against various other metadata datasets. If instead of data science, you’re more interested in helping us do more scrapes like this, then definitely contact us right away. We’re always looking for programmers, offensive security researchers (hackers), and so on. Data We haven’t looked too deeply into the different fields yet, and documentation is sparse. We’ll have to fill in a lot of gaps ourselves. Official API Let’s first look at an official API response.

romance--now with ultraviolent zombie mayhem / by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith.” I will say, this makes me immediately like the OCLC people some more. :-) There is a lot of incredible information here, a lot of which we unfortunately do not have access to in our various scraping methods. For example, there are references to other numbering systems, such as LCCN, Dewey Decimal, and a long list of externalIdentifiers. Some information in this API is only available in a subset of our scraping methods. For example, the \"work ID\", which is useful to cluster similar works, is available in our “providerSearchRequest” records. Redirects One of our simplest scraping types is “redirect_title_json”. This occurs when we make a request for a certain OCLC ID, but receive data for another OCLC ID. When this happens we can infer that these records have been merged, e.g. by a deduplication process. Indeed, for the mergedOclcNumbers in the official API, we can find the first of those redirects in our scrape: {\"aacid\":\"aacid__worldcat__20230929T222220Z__261176486__kPkdUa7GVRadsU2hitoHNb\",\"metadata\":{\"oclc_number\":261176486,\"type\":\"redirect_title_json\",\"from_filenames\":[\"w2/v7/1062/1062959057\"],\"record\":{\"redirected_oclc_number\":311684437}}} In this record you can also see the container JSON (per the Anna’s Archive Container format), as well as the metadata of which scrape file this record originates from (which we included in case it is somehow useful). Title JSON The main type of record we have is “title_json”. This is the JSON that is loaded when going to a worldcat.org/title/:id page. It can either be embedded in the page itself, or made with a separate request. We have not observed a difference in these two origins. For “Pride and prejudice and zombies” this looks like this: { \"aacid\": \"aacid__worldcat__20230929T225438Z__311684437__7dTeLjis9M5zTPpsw7i3pX\", \"metadata\": { \"oclc_number\": 311684437, \"type\": \"title_json\", \"record\": { \"oclcNumber\": \"311684437\", \"title\": \"Pride and prejudice and zombies : the classic regency romance--now with ultraviolent zombie mayhem\", \"titleInfo\": {\"text\": \"Pride and prejudice and zombies : the classic regency romance--now with ultraviolent zombie mayhem\"}, \"creator\": \"Seth Grahame-Smith\", \"generalFormat\": \"Book\", \"specificFormat\": \"PrintBook\", \"edition\": null, \"totalEditions\": 10, \"publisher\": \"Quirk Books\", \"publisherName\": {\"text\": \"Quirk Books\"}, \"publicationPlace\": \"Philadelphia\", \"publicationDate\": \"2009\", \"machineReadableDate\": \"2009\", \"catalogingLanguage\": \"eng\", \"summary\": \"As a mysterious plague falls upon the village of Meryton and zombies start rising from the dead, Elizabeth Bennet is determined to destroy the evil menace, but becomes distracted by the arrival of the dashing and arrogant Mr. Darcy\", \"physicalDescription\": \"335 pages : illustrations ; 21 cm.\", \"series\": \"Quirk classics\", \"seriesVolumes\": null, \"castNotes\": null, \"languageNotes\": null, \"subjectsText\": [ \"Austen, Jane, 1775-1817 Parodies, imitations, etc\", \"Bennet, Elizabeth (Fictitious character) Fiction\", \"Darcy, Fitzwilliam (Fictitious character) Fiction\", \"Austen, Jane, 1775-1817\", \"Bennet, Elizabeth (Fictitious character)\", \"Darcy, Fitzwilliam (Fictitious character)\", \"Zombies England Fiction\", \"Young women England Fiction\", \"Social classes England Fiction\", \"Sisters England Fiction\", \"Sisters Fiction\", \"Zombies Angleterre Romans, nouvelles, etc\", \"Jeunes femmes Angleterre Romans, nouvelles, etc\", \"Classes sociales Angleterre Romans, nouvelles, etc\", \"Sœurs Angleterre Romans, nouvelles, etc\", \"Sisters\", \"Social classes\", \"Young women\", \"Zombies\", \"Darcy, Fitzwilliam (Fictional character) Fiction\", \"Bennet, Elizabeth (Fictional character) Fiction\", \"Zombies Fiction\", \"England Fiction\", \"Angleterre Romans, nouvelles, etc\", \"England\", \"Horror tales\", \"Fictional Work\", \"parody\", \"Zombie fiction\", \"Romance fiction\", \"Parodies (Literature)\", \"Novels\", \"Humorous fiction\", \"Horror fiction\", \"Historical fiction\", \"Fiction\", \"Parodies, imitations, etc\", \"Regency fiction\", \"Romans\", \"Parodies\", \"Regency novels\" ], \"cartographicData\": null, \"dissertationInfo\": null, \"performerNotes\": null, \"genre\": \"Horror tales\", \"numericDesignation\": null, \"audience\": null, \"generalNotes\": null, \"creditNotes\": null, \"contentNotes\": null, \"reproductionNotes\": null, \"eventNotes\": null, \"doi\": null, \"peerReviewed\": false, \"mediumOfPerformance\": null, \"issns\": null, \"additionalPhysicalFormEntries\": null, \"digitalAccessAndLocations\": null, \"digitalObjectInfo\": null, \"abstract\": null, \"evaluativeContent\": \" Preface to the Deluxe Heirloom Edition9 (4)Pride and Prejudice and Zombies 13 (341) Afterword354 (4) A Reader's Discussion Guide358 (2) About the Authors and Illustrator360\", \"otherFormats\": [{\"oclcNumber\": \"668228203\",\"generalFormat\": \"Book\",\"specificFormat\": \"Digital\"}], \"isbns\": [\"9781594743344\",\"9781594743351\",\"9781594744518\",\"1594743347\",\"1594743355\",\"1594744513\"], \"isbn13\": \"9781594743344\", \"openAccessLinks\": [], \"publication\": null, \"sourceIssn\": null, \"sourceIsbns\": null, \"contributors\": [ { \"firstName\": {\"text\": \"Seth\"}, \"secondName\": {\"text\": \"Grahame-Smith\"}, \"isPrimary\": true, \"relatorCodes\": [\"aut\"] }, { \"firstName\": {\"text\": \"Roberto\"}, \"secondName\": {\"text\": \"Parada\"}, \"isPrimary\": false, \"relatorCodes\": [\"ill\"] }, { \"firstName\": {\"text\": \"Jane\"}, \"secondName\": {\"text\": \"Austen\"}, \"isPrimary\": false, \"includes\": [{\"title\": \"Pride and prejudice\",\"relationship\": \"Parody of (work):\"}], \"relatorCodes\": [\"http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/w/P10197\"] } ] } } } This is mostly a subset of the official API, though this does contain some metadata indicating that this Jane Austen is not an actual author, but a \"parody of\" relationship (the http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/w/P10197) at the very end.

OCLC has a de facto monopoly on it due to the Worldcat database. They&#x27;re a non-profit, but they&#x27;re supported by having libraries pay a subscription fee for Worldcat.Back when OCLC was founded, the idea that people would want to have a copy of a card catalog for personal use was laughable, so I&#x27;m sympathetic to the people that set up their funding model. It&#x27;s far cheaper for a library to subscribe to Worldcat than to hire a team to maintain such a database, so it created a win-win situation.However, keeping the world&#x27;s books&#x27; metadata a secret (and leaving control in the hands of a monopoly) is an anachronism.It&#x27;s well past the time when someone (such as an international coalition of Libraries of Congress) should figure out how to sustainably fund OCLC while also releasing their work into the public domain. reply mgr86 14 hours agoparentI have been told that my organization developed a system, HABS, that pre-dated OCLC [0]. That OCLC used this system as an inspiration. However, I cannot confirm this. Closest I can do is to find a footnote that Thanks Fred Kilgore, the founder of OCLC [1]. I should reach out to Koh, a friend of a friend, while she is still alive to confirm the story. Nevertheless, we have a collection of punch cards in a dusty room in an attic that was once the HABS system. I think it is a pretty fascinating legacy, and I wish it was better preserved.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;106939716900400...

I hope you can learn more from Koh.I know a bit about Henriette Avram and her work at LoC developing MARC, but it of course makes sense that other libraries were thinking along similar lines at the time. reply partytax 9 hours agoparentprevThe Melville Decimal System popularized by https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.librarything.com may be of interest.Here&#x27;s an explanation from their footer: \"Although Dewey invented his system in 1876, recent editions of his system are in copyright. LibraryThing&#x27;s Melvil Decimal System is based on the classification work of libraries around the world, whose assignments are not copyrightable. The \"schedules\" (the words that describe the numbers) come from a pre-copyright edition of his system, John Mark Ockerbloom&#x27;s Free Decimal System, and member contributions.\" reply mannyv 7 hours agoparentprevOne strange thing about the Dewey Decimal System is that it&#x27;s copyrighted and libraries pay a fee to use it.It came out when the Library Hotel in NYC used some of their notation as their room numbers and were sued. Everyone was WTF? reply actuallyalys 16 hours agoparentprevI suppose one way to do it would be to allow patrons of subscriber libraries to access the database dumps and API.The downside is that would still make it harder than necessary to access and leave some people out. The upside is that it&#x27;s not that much of change from their existing model. I&#x27;m sure there would also be concerns about database dumps being shared publicly, although Anna&#x27;s Archive has already released their entire database, and I suspect most people who would pay for formal access wouldn&#x27;t use an authorized copy. Ultimately, I suspect OCLC would still be resistant to this change, as it would feel like a huge shift, even if I&#x27;m not sure it would change much from their perspective. reply empthought 13 hours agoparentprevOCLC is a nonprofit membership cooperative and would argue that it itself is that international coalition of national libraries and archives. reply IKantRead 12 hours agorootparentOCLC is a parasitic company masquerading as a \"membership cooperative\".Libraries (often publicly funded) produce all the work, OCLC claims ownership of the results of that work, Libraries pay to get it back (but they do get a discount if they contribute).The only reason OCLC continues to exist is because libraries don&#x27;t have the support or resources to fight them. It&#x27;s very similar to the Elsevier issue in academic publishing, but OCLC does a better job with PR. reply empthought 12 hours agorootparentI mean you’ve clearly read Aaron Swartz’s diatribes, but you also clearly have no clue about OCLC’s business model.

The often overlooked fact is ISBN was introduced in late 1960s, so books published prior to that obviously does not have that number; and not all countries adopted ISBN from day one, some like China was on its own catalog systems until 1980s; and bc ISBN are usually centralized managed by govt or commercial agencies, censorship with political or commercial reasons are not uncommon, some books were not able to get published, or may only see the world without an ISBN.For obvious reasons, older &#x2F; non-English &#x2F; suppressed books may be those need more care when it comes to preserving. reply wiml 15 hours agoparentA second issue is that ISBNs identify a specific SKU (different formats will have different ISBNs, different printings may even get different ISBNs, etc), but book-related projects typically want some way to identify \"the same book\" across all these different formats, printings, sometimes even editions and translations and collections. OCLC IDs are identifying a different space than ISBNs are. reply Tomte 4 hours agorootparentThe biggest problem of all is that there are many ISBNs that have been reused for either a later edition of \"the same\" book or for a totally different book, which should never happen.Sometimes it is because people are sloppy, sometimes people try to save a little money (because ISBNs cost money). reply raybb 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat you&#x27;re referring to is sometimes referred to as a \"work\" vs \"edition\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openlibrary.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;faq&#x2F;editing#work-edition reply ahi 11 hours agorootparentIt gets much much more complicated than that.

The WorldCat database has been around since the early 70s, so I think that helps the numbers a bit. I don&#x27;t have any insight into their marketing&#x2F;sales&#x2F;end user experience though. reply gmcharlt 19 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not the software per se, which is generally fit for purpose but not amazing, but the traditions and economics underpinning how libraries maintain their bibliographic metadata.Libraries sharing metadata for their catalogs has a long history, dating back to at least 1902 when the Library of Congress started selling catalog cards for use by other libraries. In the 1960s, the Library of Congress embarked on various projects to computerize their catalog, leading to the creation of the MARC format as a common metadata format for exchanging bibliographic records. (And there is a straight line between how card catalogs were put together and much of how library metadata is conceptualized, although that&#x27;s been (slowly) changing.)One problem is that bibliographic metadata from the Library of Congress is mostly generated in-house, and LoC does not catalog everything; not even close. In the late 1960s, OCLC, the organization behind Worldcat, was started to operate a union catalog. The idea is that libraries could download bibliographic records needed for their own catalogs (\"copy cataloging\") and contribute new records for the unique stuff they cataloged (\"original cataloging\"). Under the aegis of OCLC as a non-profit organization, it was a pretty good deal for libraries, and over time led to additional services such as brokering interlibrary loan requests. After all, since Worldcat had a good idea of the holdings of libraries in North America (and over time, a good chunk of Europe and other areas), it was straightforward to set up an exchange for ILL requests.Tie this with a general trend over the past couple decades of libraries decreasing the funding and staffing for maintaining their local catalogs, and need for sharing in the creation and maintenance of library metadata has gotten only more important.However, OCLC has had a long history of trying to control access and use of the metadata in WorldCat, to the point of earning a general perception in many library quarters of trying to monopolize it. To give a taste, Aaron Swartz tangled with them back in the day. [1] One irony, among many, is that the majority of metadata in Worldcat has its origins in the efforts by publicly-funded libraries and as such shouldn&#x27;t have been enclosed in the first place. OCLC also has a focus on growing itself, to the point where it does far more than run Worldcat. Its various ventures have earned itself a reputation for charging high prices to libraries, to the point where it can be too expensive for smaller libraries to participate in Worldcat. (Fortunately for them, there are various alternative ways of getting MARC records for free or very cheap, but nobody has a database more comprehensive than Worldcat.)That said, OCLC does do quite a bit itself to improve the overall quality of Worldcat and to try to push libraries past the 1960s-era MARC format. But one of the ironies of the scraping is that it&#x27;s not going to be immediately helpful to the libraries who are unable to afford to participate in Worldcat. This is because the scrape didn&#x27;t (and quite possibly never could have) capture the data in MARC format, which is what most library catalog software uses. While MARC records could be cross-walked from the JSON, they will undoubtedly omit some data elements found in the original MARC.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aaronsw.com&#x2F;weblog&#x2F;oclcreply reply wayathr0w 16 hours agorootparentIf you liked the comment-length analysis OCLC & want more, there&#x27;s a whole essay on the subject.

The main problem was that there was not a ton of overlap of ISBNs.What prevents ISBN number collisions between authors? Is there a central authority assigning them, or is there say a national prefix, with each government assigning ISBN&#x27;s for local publications (perhaps delegating this to another body in that nation).Surely such bodies would have the most complete view on all this data.It&#x27;s also bizarre that this simple metadata is not available from whatever authority assigns ISBN numbers.. reply sevenseventen 19 hours agoparentThere are regional ISBN agencies. The US agency, Bowker, assigns ISBN prefixes by publisher, and publishers assign within their prefix as they please. They&#x27;re supposed to use one ISBN per edition and format, but many publishers use ISBN as a kind of SKU so you can&#x27;t 100% count on that.If that sounds sloppy...I went to publishing conferences fairly regularly from the late 90&#x27;s into the teens, and I never saw a program that didn&#x27;t have at least one session or panel titled something like \"Publishers must improve their metadata practices.\" reply bambax 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s exactly like this. Publishers get a range, and do whatever they want with it.Also, some agencies sell the numbers range to publishers (I believe the US is in that case) and others give them away at no cost (France). As a result, some small publishers get ISBNs from more liberal agencies than their own country: one can never be 100% sure a French ISBN matches a French publisher for example.It&#x27;s also possible some publishers re-use old numbers or affix the same number to different releases&#x2F;editions of a book.It&#x27;s a mess.But a global centralized system would probably be way worse, so we have to live with that mess. reply amelius 15 hours agorootparentWhy not use UUIDs?People never enter ISBNs manually, anyways.

So you’d have to invent a new format. reply jszymborski 17 hours agorootparentprevSounds a bit like how DOIs are assigned. reply gmcharlt 19 hours agoparentprevISBNs are messy.The International ISBN Agency coordinates assigning ISBN ranges to national agencies, who in turn will assign subranges to publishers. The publishers in turn assign specific numbers to their own works. However, the international agency does not itself maintain a universal database of assigned ISBNs - the most it operates is a global database of publishers and their assigned ranges. And since it&#x27;s the publishers who are assigning numbers from their allocations, various errors can crop up, including reusing ISBNs for different works and failing to issue distinct ISBNs for different formats. (For example, if you publish hardcover, paperbook, and ebook versions of a book, you should assign three ISBNs. That rule is not always observed.)Also, libraries hold many books that long predate ISBNs; it wasn&#x27;t until 1965 that the immediate predecessor of the ISBN, the SBN, was a twinkle in a bookseller&#x27;s eye. reply bambax 17 hours agorootparentYes.And while in most countries you can&#x27;t properly publish a book without an ISBN (ie, have it sold in bookshops), you can publish a Kindle book without it (if you opt to only offer the ebook).That leaves a huge part of publications completely out of the system. Kindle-only books are on Amazon servers and nowhere else. reply crtasm 18 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s lots of agencies, they hand out blocks of numbers from their allocation.

ISBN_FAQs_to_7ed_Manual_Absolutely_final.docx> Will people in other countries be able to search for my books in search engines in those countries?> This does not happen automatically ... In order for your book to be listed in other countries you should contact the respective ISBN Agency and ask them for details of how to be entered into their national catalogue for books in circulation (books in print). Sometimes you will have to obtain a distributor from that country or have an address in that country before this is possible. In some circumstances in order to be listed, the book must be in the language of that country. As well as catalogues of books in circulation, you may also want to ensure that you are listed by internet retailers... . Again, you will need to contact each of these organisations directly (including each separate international branch) with details of your book. reply skuxxlife 15 hours agoparentprevFor US&#x2F;UK&#x2F;NZ&#x2F;Aus&#x2F;SA, ISBNs are granted through Bowker who does maintain their \"Books In Print\" data set that, in theory, contains metadata for all of the ISBNs they&#x27;ve granted. In practice though it&#x27;s a mess. It&#x27;s expensive to access and relies on publishers to enter in accurate and consistent metadata, which is...variable in quality to say the least. Often publishers buy blocks of ISBNs to use later so no metadata is entered up front and has to be pushed back to Bowker at a later date. To be somewhat fair to Bowker, the history of ISBNs far predates modern data standards and I can imagine wrangling publishers to get accurate data is a difficult task. But on the other hand, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d have a lot to gain for doing it right.

Significant changes include a transport-level ping mechanism and keystroke timing obfuscation: This attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small amount of data being sent. It also sends fake \"chaff\" keystrokes for a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword. From: Damien MillerTo: lwn-AT-lwn.net Subject: Announce: OpenSSH 9.5 released Date: Wed, 04 Oct 2023 04:27:22 -0600 Message-ID:OpenSSH 9.5 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors listed at https://www.openssh.com/ shortly. OpenSSH is a 100% complete SSH protocol 2.0 implementation and includes sftp client and server support. Once again, we would like to thank the OpenSSH community for their continued support of the project, especially those who contributed code or patches, reported bugs, tested snapshots or donated to the project. More information on donations may be found at: https://www.openssh.com/donations.html Changes since OpenSSH 9.4 ========================= This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features. Potentially incompatible changes -------------------------------- * ssh-keygen(1): generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5 (January 2014). * sshd(8): the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected. New features ------------ * ssh(1): add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small amount of data being sent. It also sends fake \"chaff\" keystrokes for a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword. * ssh(1), sshd(8): Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the \"local extensions\" number space and are advertised using a \"ping@openssh.com\" ext-info message with a string version number of \"0\". * sshd(8): allow override of Sybsystem directives in sshd Match blocks. Bugfixes -------- * scp(1): fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode, the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not. bz3611 * ssh-keygen(1): handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in sshsig signature files. * ssh(1): interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they originally requested a tty. * sshd(8): make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins * sshd(8): limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s) and don't delay at all for the \"none\" authentication mechanism.cw bz3602 * sshd(8): Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal(). * sshd(8): correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes to be sent less frequently than configured. * ssh(1): fix regression in OpenSSH 9.4 (mux.c r1.99) that caused multiplexed sessions to ignore SIGINT under some circumstances. Portability ----------- * Avoid clang zero-call-used-regs=all bug on Apple compilers, which for some reason have version numbers that do not match the upstream clang version numbers. bz#3584 * Fix configure test for zlib 1.3 and later/development versions. bz3604 Checksums: ========== - SHA1 (openssh-9.5.tar.gz) = 8a0bd3a91fac338d97d91817af58df731f6509a3 - SHA256 (openssh-9.5.tar.gz) = sVMxeM3d6g65qBMktJIofxmK4Ipg9dblKif0VnhPeO0= - SHA1 (openssh-9.5p1.tar.gz) = 35c16dcc6e7d0a9465faa241476ef24f76b196cc - SHA256 (openssh-9.5p1.tar.gz) = 8Cbnt5un+1QPdRgq+W3IqPHbOV+SK7yfbKYDZyaGCGs= Please note that the SHA256 signatures are base64 encoded and not hexadecimal (which is the default for most checksum tools).

That'd alone fix more user frustration than all other improvements in openssh taken together since at least a decade: when your link goes down, the ssh connection transparently migrates onto your phone. Got two similar quality links? The bandwidth gets summed. Running with a laptop to a place with a different access point? If your network card/software can handle multiple links, you're golden (NM/connman/... suck so bad here though). OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 15:38 UTC (Wed) by Sesse (subscriber, #53779) [Link] If that single platform were OpenBSD, I doubt it would be a blocker… :-) OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 15:44 UTC (Wed) by kilobyte (subscriber, #108024) [Link] Well yeah, the vast majority of users are not on OpenBSD though. On the other hand, someone managed to get Linux network stack including MPTCP running on Windows via lkl (ie, in userspace, talking to a tun interface) -- perhaps the same could work on OpenBSD before it grows native support? OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 16:30 UTC (Wed) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link] Can you link to references for the MPTCP support being blocked? The search terms '\"openssh\" \"mptcp\"' are sufficiently nondescript that I can't find anything, either on the OpenSSH Bugzilla, or via Google, or in the openssh-unix-dev mailing list archives. OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 16:35 UTC (Wed) by kilobyte (subscriber, #108024) [Link] Anything that doesn't work on OpenBSD itself goes to openssh-portable; the pull request in question is https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/335 This said, I assume that openbsd kernel lacking an implementation is a temporary thing. OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 22:19 UTC (Wed) by Sesse (subscriber, #53779) [Link] Wow, that patch doesn't exactly strike me as a huge maintenance burden. OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 5, 2023 8:58 UTC (Thu) by farnz (subscriber, #17727) [Link] On the other hand, it failed CI - unfortunately, logs are no longer available because of the time since that patch, but that in itself is concerning. OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 16:32 UTC (Wed) by zdzichu (subscriber, #17118) [Link] I think Darwin includes MPTCP, as is Linux 5.19+. So two platforms at least? OpenSSH 9.5 released Posted Oct 4, 2023 18:02 UTC (Wed) by bluca (subscriber, #118303) [Link] OpenSSH is pretty much a BSD project that sort of works on Linux as a side hobby. We really should band together a bunch of mainstream Linux distros and fork it, so that we can modernize it with things like MPTCP, AF_VSOCK and more. Forking Posted Oct 4, 2023 18:34 UTC (Wed) by corbet (editor, #1) [Link] Might it be worth trying to contribute back to the portable OpenSSH project before forking? (Assuming, of course, that this has not already been tried). Forking Posted Oct 4, 2023 18:39 UTC (Wed) by bluca (subscriber, #118303) [Link] They routinely reject non-BSD specific features and enhancements. MPTCP, VRF, default config files in /usr/, AF_VSOCK, and more. It's not for lack of trying, patches do get sent. Forking Posted Oct 4, 2023 19:30 UTC (Wed) by mjg59 (subscriber, #23239) [Link] And it wouldn't be unheard of, most of the Windows integration is in a Microsoft fork rather than upstream. Forking Posted Oct 4, 2023 23:30 UTC (Wed) by zwol (guest, #126152) [Link] If these features are really so great, maybe you should be trying to convince the BSD kernel people to adopt them. Forking Posted Oct 4, 2023 23:33 UTC (Wed) by mpr22 (subscriber, #60784) [Link] By \"adopt\", you mean \"reimplement from scratch, because they can't take implementations from the Linux kernel for obvious reasons\".

IMO it's reasonable to wait and see if this gains wide adoption before implementing it. New TCP-like networking protocols have come along before (e.g. SCTP) and have not been widely adopted. It's been a thing for like 15 years, it's used on Linux, OSX and IOS. But of course if by \"wide adoption\" you mean \"it's implemented on BSD\", then yeah, in that sense it doesn't have \"wide adoption\" yet, and probably never will > OpenSSH already has better VRF support than most other daemons, including Linux support. I'm not aware of outstanding feature requests in this area, but if they came in then we'd definitely look at them. No, it does not. Or rather, it supports the BSD version of VRF very well, which I'm sure it's great for both its users, but the openssh client lacks native support for Linux's VRF, and the patch for it was rejected: https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2784 and requires some horrendous workarounds that needs either root or setuid binaries, which is just a great idea as we've seen the other day with the setuid CVE in glibc > > default config files in /usr/ > Again, I'm not aware of feature requests for this that have been rejected. It seem pretty possible using existing compile-time knobs + Include directives. It is not possible to use existing knobs for this, and it has been rejected when a SUSE developer approached the project to talk about this RFE. If it wasn't from you, maybe it was from another maintainer. openSUSE has to ship some downstream patches and workarounds because of that to support transactional updates in MicroOS. > > AF_VSOCK > Again, nobody has asked for this. True, I was thinking of AF_UNIX there https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/435 AF_VSOCK hasn't been tried yet given it doesn't support AF_UNIX which is much simpler Forking Posted Oct 5, 2023 10:09 UTC (Thu) by kilobyte (subscriber, #108024) [Link] >Yeah, we've not implemented this yet. IMO it's reasonable to wait and see if this gains wide adoption before implementing it. New TCP-like networking protocols have come along before (e.g. SCTP) and have not been widely adopted. That's reasonable but it hits a chicken-and-egg problem: can't use a feature that the program you're using doesn't support. And given how this particular feature lives 99% in the kernel, making the patch nothing but: option? IPPROTO_MPTCP : ai->ai_protocol plus configuration, which should be simple enough to not take any non-trivial effort from you. Also given how aggressively at least the Linux implementation falls back to regular TCP it might even be reasonable to drop the configuration bits and hard-code the flag (falling back for old kernels). As for SCTP, yes, it's a good comparison. Both protocols implement similar functionality, and SCTP is far more mature (but lacking lessons we learned since) and not hobbled by having to conform to TCP. The problem is, with idiot ISPs you can't use SCTP on today's Internet: * 20 years ago, ISPs workers knew well that non-TCP non-UDP are stuff evil hackers use, customers need to be protected. And ICMP is not a protocol but some magic. * today, ISP workers know that there are only two protocols: TCP and UDP Thus, if you lack the tuits to implement MPTCP in OpenBSD today, it would be great if you could for now enable it on Linux and see if people actually use it.

I guess it was designed to be a smaller die-area solution for some of their silicon IP products, and opening it up just makes it more convenient for their customers to use. (And, hopefully, nobody is stupid enough to use some vendor&#x27;s secret proprietary crypto in their chips).I&#x27;d be interested to read a history of Rambus. They&#x27;re a strange and somewhat controversial company. I lived through the controversy but I&#x27;m not certain I remember it correctly. From what I remember they patented some things related to DDR SDRAM, I&#x27;m not sure how much credit they deserve for developing those things or if they were just first to file. For part of the Pentium 4&#x27;s lifecycle they convinced Intel to use Rambus&#x27; proprietary DRAM (RDRAM) which supposedly had some benefits but I just remember being overpriced. They shook down DDR manufacturers for patent licensing fees. Apparently the EU opened an antitrust investigation into them for getting their patents into the standard and then not licensing them freely enough. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fair to call them a patent troll but I guess they&#x27;re something similar to Fraunhofer or Synopsis. reply sweis 17 hours agorootparentRambus bought Cryptography Research about 12 years ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rambus.com&#x2F;rambus-completes-acquisition-of-crypt... reply brohee 17 hours agorootparentprevRambus was pretty well known for using a submarine patent against RAM manufacturers back in late nineties https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edn.com&#x2F;submarine-patents-could-torpedo-rambus&#x2F; followed by fifteen years of acting like a patent troll...They may have good tech but have an history of being super shady. reply tptacek 14 hours agorootparentprevThis comment is cringe enough that it is making the rounds on multiple Slacks.

This type of behavior is known as a \"patent ambush\".> Ronald Black, Rambus&#x27;s CEO, said, \"Somehow we got thrown into the patent troll bunch...This is just not the case.\"[43]See, they are the good guys after all.

When you&#x27;re first starting out on a project, have no users, and its mostly feature incomplete there is little to no drive or reason to care about whole classes of security and performance issues... You&#x27;re trying to just get the thing to work.Let&#x27;s ignore ongoing feature creep and development in projects for now (I&#x27;ll address this in a second). As the core software becomes functional, gains users, has bugs fixed, the threat model of the software needs to change and grow. Generally software in this state gets progressively more stable and in that stability you can see the tiny ripples of very small edge cases.For software where security is paramount and has an uncountable number of users protecting uncountable bytes of data like SSH, the tiny ripples of extremely esoteric attacks become a reasonable thing to address as a feature improvement. Do I need this feature for my personal threat model or even the threat model of my company? No probably not... But it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have it either.This feature raises the cost of attacking the software, and may dissuade different attacker from even trying. Most of practical security is more about making attacks expensive enough that they attacker will have to spend more than the value of what they would obtain if they were able to break into it and this change helps keep that high watermark well above those thresholds.For software that does have ongoing feature creep this process is a lot slower but does seem to happen for opensource projects specifically that can survive their infancy sufficiently long enough to become foundational components like SSH and Curl. I&#x27;ve never seen this level stability from closed source software. reply habibur 17 hours agoparentprevThere was a recent research paper shared here where it was claimed using keystroke timing and some AI, researchers could predict the password with significant accuracy. reply sophacles 18 hours agoparentprevKeystroke timing attacks have been known for quite a while - heres a highly cited paper from over 20 years ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conference&#x2F;10th-usenix-security-sympo...Recently there has been some work on using audio of keypresses to determine what&#x27;s been typed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2308.01074.pdf .The statistical analysis described earlier works better when you have samples of a person&#x27;s typing to try and learn whats been sent, but the acoustic work has raised some concerns that ML techniques can be used on just packet timings to determine what&#x27;s been typed without a pre-determined signature.

Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols, validate the results, or replicate them in follow-up research. One research manager at a Department of Energy weapons lab would later admit, “Far more progress is actually evidenced in the unclassified fields of research than the classified ones.” The physicist Robert McCrory, whose own lab received millions in funding in partnership with Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos National Laboratories, was even more blunt: “Some of the work is so poor that if it were declassified, it would be laughed off the face of the Earth.” We can only guess what, specifically, McCrory had in mind when he said this. There are all too many possibilities. Collectively, they lend credence to the oft-stated concern that secret programs became a refuge for second- and third-rate minds. The wizards of Langley, for instance, considered it a “remarkable scientific achievement” when they managed to prove that cats could be “trained to move short distances.” According to a CIA veteran, Victor Marchetti, this achievement was part of a program to determine whether cats could be turned into surveillance devices: A lot of money was spent. They slit the cat open, put batteries in him, wired him up. The tail was used as an antenna. They made a monstrosity. They tested him and tested him. They found he would walk off the job when he got hungry, so they put another wire in to override that. Finally they’re ready. They took it out to a park and pointed it at a park bench and said, “Listen to those two guys. Don’t listen to anything else—not the birds, no dog or cat—just those two guys!” They put him out of the van, and a taxi comes and runs him over. There they were, sitting in the van with all those dials, and the cat was dead! The CIA nevertheless commended the “energy and imagination” of the team, and considered them potential “models for scientific pioneers.” Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols. It could be argued that a sprawling research program purposely designed to push the envelope will, over several decades, inevitably produce some strange and low-quality research. But in some cases it is possible to make a side-by-side comparison of US government research with research commissioned by another country that had fewer resources but the same goal. For instance, during World War II, American and British forces both used dogs to detect mines. It was delicate, dangerous work, and the dogs sometimes proved unreliable. Both governments therefore mounted research projects in the early 1950s to evaluate and improve dogs’ ability to locate mines. ____________________________________ The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals about America’s Top Secrets by Matthew Connelly has been shortlisted for the 2023 Cundill History Prize. ____________________________________ The British just wanted “the facts” and sought out a “trained scientist.” They selected Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist expert in animal behavior. He designed the experiment to eliminate the possibility that human handlers were unconsciously influencing the dogs’ performance. This required systematically isolating the specific biochemical and physiological factors that might explain success or failure, since either could prove important when mines were odorless. Zuckerman had a strong personal motivation—he had seen the devastating impact of blast injuries when he conducted wartime physiological research with the survivors. His larger agenda was to develop more rigorous experimental methods in animal research. Zuckerman found no solid evidence that dogs could be relied on to detect buried mines. The U.S. Army, on the other hand, hired a “parapsychologist” named J. B. Rhine. It is not clear why—all the army records were later destroyed. Though his training was in botany, Rhine had become famous for his experiments—never replicated— in extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis. For Rhine, the study was an opportunity to prove that ESP really existed; he had already gathered a collection of amazing stories of animal ESP. Rhine once again convinced himself that dogs possessed special powers. Army officials found in follow-up work that the results were random, and another study proved to be a complete failure, marked by a “rather conspicuous refusal of the dogs to alert.” But Rhine used the army money to seed new research, and found new customers. The Office of Naval Research funded a decade of work on ESP in homing pigeons. In other studies, one of Rhine’s colleagues tried to influence a cat telepathically to select one dish of food over another. But here, too, even Rhine admitted that the results were “not spectacular.” Alas, the cats proved “elusive.” The US government would spend several decades on the larger program of mind-control research. And Rhine was a paragon of scientific rigor compared with some of the other researchers on the government payroll, who espoused theories of extraterrestrial and ghostly visitations to explain ESP, and were hired by the US Army to consult on psychedelic mushrooms. The CIA’s Project MKUltra involved a whole series of experiments on unwitting subjects, using a range of different drugs in order to manipulate them into saying and doing things against their will. It was given carte blanche to operate without the normal Agency accounting controls or need for written contracts. Once again, researchers rapidly escalated their trials with little understanding of the effects. In the first round of an experiment conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, one of the patients, Harold Blauer, was given 0.4 mg of methylenedioxyphenyl-isopropylamine, a drug similar to ecstasy. The next dose was sixteen times stronger, and Blauer was dead in thirty minutes. When the family took legal action, government lawyers threatened witnesses with prosecution under the Espionage Act. Decades later, CIA Director Stansfield Turner admitted that “some unwitting testing took place,” but testified to Congress that the subjects were “criminal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital.” In fact, Blauer was a tennis pro who voluntarily sought treatment for depression after a divorce. The CIA also experimented on its own personnel. In one case, the head of MKUltra, a chemist named Sidney Gottlieb, dosed the attendees of a joint Agency-army retreat with LSD. One of the unwitting subjects, an army biochemist named Frank Olson, was traumatized by the experience. Until then, Olson had been an outgoing and devoted family man. Afterward, he sank into depression, overcome with feelings of shame, and would not return home. He told his army supervisor that he wanted to quit or be fired. Gottlieb was likely alarmed upon being warned about this situation. MKUltra had been approved by the CIA director himself, Allen Dulles, who called the program “ultra-sensitive.” But Gottlieb reportedly had not obtained prior authorization before drugging Olson and the others. As an internal Agency report later noted, participants in this work well understood that their methods were “professionally unethical” and legally dubious, and would provoke “serious adverse reaction” from the public if ever revealed. Gottlieb therefore had a powerful motivation to make certain Olson told no one about what the CIA had done to him. The government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes. Gottlieb and his deputy decided to take Olson to see a New York doctor. The man had no psychiatric training but did have a top-secret CIA security clearance and experience with LSD. The doctor plied Olson with bourbon and sedatives, and took him to see a performance by a magician, whom Gottlieb was interested in hiring to help dose more unwitting targets. Olson’s public behavior became increasingly erratic, and he said that the Agency was “out to get him.” The doctor said he would take Olson to a sanitarium to be treated by CIA psychiatrists. But that night, Olson “fell” from the tenth floor of the Statler Hotel in Manhattan. Gottlieb’s deputy was sharing the room with him, and claimed to have been asleep when it happened. His story was that Olson had just crashed right through the window, without opening it first, or even raising the shade. We may never know what happened in that hotel room. But at the time, the CIA was training its assassins to first ply their victims with drugs or alcohol, and advised, “The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.” The CIA was clearly prepared to kill innocent American citizens. Six weeks after the Agency covered up what happened to Olson, a CIA mind-control team went on its first foreign assignment. The mission was to slip “artichoke”—likely LSD—into the drink of another unwitting subject and induce him to attempt an assassination of a prominent politician or American official. The artichoke team was primed for action, proudly noting that they “were ready when called upon for support, even though the operation did not materialize.” Most of the MKUltra records were later destroyed, so we cannot know what other missions might have aimed to achieve. But CIA mind-control research went on for more than a decade, involved some eighty different institutions, and would eventually cost approximately ten million dollars—about a hundred million in today’s dollars. A whole new mind-control program started up in 1972, this time led by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The goal of this new program was “to determine whether anomalous mental phenomena (i.e. extrasensory perception and psychokinesis) existed and the degree to which such phenomena might be applicable to problems of national interest.” Like MKUltra, it went on for many years, and cost many millions of dollars. How many exactly is still difficult to determine. But a single California contractor, SRI International, would eventually receive $11.3 million (or about thirty-six million in today’s dollars). Even escape artists and magicians saw that the government was being rooked, and patiently explained to officials how timeworn tools of their trade could easily trick someone into believing in ESP. So, too, did the scientists at DARPA, who concluded that the Israeli illusionist Uri Geller, the DIA’s star pupil, was a “charlatan.” They thought it was “ridiculous” that Geller had fooled the US government into using taxpayer dollars to see whether he could bend spoons with his brain. They pointed to a host of problems with the ESP and psychokinesis experiments, above all the fact that the people paid to conduct them had a financial incentive to produce positive results. Under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild. In 1985, the army commissioned a blue-ribbon panel from the National Research Council to evaluate the program. The panel concluded there was “no scientific warrant for the existence of parapsychological phenomena” such as “remote-viewing”—sensing the location or appearance of things through sheer mental effort—or psychokinesis. Nevertheless, over the following decade the army conducted between fifty and a hundred more such experiments. In 1995, another review of the remote-viewing program was commissioned, this time by the American Institutes for Research (AIR). Once again, the reviewers found that, because of flaws in the research designs, there was no clear evidence demonstrating the existence of the paranormal. But the AIR report found something even more damning. After some twenty-five years of experiments, the reviewers concluded, “In no case had the information provided ever been used to guide intelligence operations.” Even if some people really do have ESP that cannot be explained by science, the point of the program was not to use government resources to explore the Twilight Zone. It was to support actual missions that would safeguard national security. Yet, despite all the time and money spent—not to mention the human costs—the government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes. Why, then, did the intelligence community and the Pentagon go to extremes in pursuing such embarrassing “research”? For the same reason why they felt they had license to control the weather and alter the upper atmosphere: because, under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild. Moreover, controlling people’s minds was a prize that was just too tempting to resist. And although the government may have given up on telekinetic spoons, it did not give up on that larger goal. During the first decade of the “Global War on Terror,” the CIA pursued mind control through more direct methods—i.e., “enhanced interrogation.” The program employed psychological abuse, stress positions, and waterboarding not just to make people talk, but also to discover scientifically rigorous and reproducible methods for compelling subjects to submit to the will of interrogators and lose all sense of personal agency. Just like MKUltra, the enhanced-interrogation program was conducted as a series of “experiments.” Here is how the CIA’s Office of Medical Services, in a top- secret 2004 document, described the protocol for recording the application of “treatments” to “subjects”: In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment. The CIA hired a retired air-force psychologist named James Mitchell to enact these methods. Mitchell, too, saw himself as a scientist. As an informed source recounted to the journalist Jane Mayer, after Mitchell took over a case, he told the FBI agents that an interrogation “was like an experiment, when you apply electric shocks to a caged dog, after a while, he’s so diminished, he can’t resist.” When the agents argued that the subject of this experiment was a human being and not a dog, Mitchell retorted, “Science is science.” Waterboarding, “diapering,” and stress positions ultimately proved no more effective than ESP or psychokinesis, as the CIA’s own internal reviews concluded. Many of the victims had already provided valuable intelligence to their interrogators before they were tortured, and once the waterboarding began, many offered false information in order to make it stop. But the waterboarding did not stop until Mitchell’s company was paid eighty-one million dollars. __________________________________ Excerpted from The Declassification Engine: What History Reveals about America’s Top Secrets by Matthew Connelly.

These disturbing phenomena seem to deny all our usual scientific ideas. How we should like to discredit them! Unfortunately the statistical evidence, at least for telepathy, is overwhelming. It is very difficult to rearrange one&#x27;s ideas so as to fit these new facts in.(This is from a paragraph dealing with ESP&#x27;s implications are for the existence of thinking machines.)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;redirect.cs.umbc.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;471&#x2F;papers&#x2F;turing.pdf reply guntars 13 hours agoparentThe scientists would love nothing more than to discover a whole new area of study, alas ESP doesn’t lend itself to study despite the overwhelming statistical evidence (?) because it’s made up. reply krapp 9 hours agorootparentTo be fair, it does lend itself to study, and governments and scientists have studied it (which is how we know it&#x27;s made up.)Unfortunately, the existence of such studies alone will convince conspiracy theorists that the CIA has psychic spies and remote viewers everywhere. reply ballenf 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s kind of ironic how quantum physics discoveries have given these proponents new language to cloak their claims in. When you have quantum effects that depend on observation, it can be quite convincing to a lay person that an ESP ability could just as easily do the same.I have given up on the idea that science or scientific discoveries will ever soundly banish the ideas of non-materialist claims. reply CapitalistCartr 17 hours agoprevIf you&#x27;re interested, the CIA was enamored of LSD for decades.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MKUltraPoisoning people: MKNAOMIhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MKNAOMI reply dantheman 16 hours agoparentThis is an also interesting take on that era: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Chaos-Charles-Manson-History-Sixties&#x2F;...It&#x27;s too bad that so much of the records have been destroyed.

Worse, I feel that Fahrenheit 9&#x2F;11 is the coloring book version of the Bush Admin&#x27;s crimes and misdemeanors.However. After watching the audience&#x27;s reaction, I accept that Moore is right and I am wrong. He met people where they&#x27;re at and showed them something new. Resulting in a greater awareness.

Thank goodness reforms have been made so that excesses like those described cannot happen again reply lazide 17 hours agoparentI really can’t tell if you’re being sarcastic or not.We already knew this before those specific abuses in the 50’s-70’s. They were already illegal, which is why they were done by the secret agencies, and not by - say - the dept. of health (directly).Congressional oversight has only gotten weaker since the Church commission (and frankly, the Church commission only made the mildest impact from what I can tell).The real question is, what are they up to now? reply avgcorrection 17 hours agorootparentThat comment is brilliant because a lot of the commentary on past bad deeds exude that stance without stating it so explicitly.Here&#x27;s the general lifecycle:1. Year 0: you are a conspiracy theorist if you think that X is doing Y2. Year 15: only people on the fringes think that X was doing Y3. Year [declassified documents]: Some nerd reads it, tells it to a living room full of people4. Year [declassified documents] + 15: We have learned a lot from how X was doing Y in the past; the leaders of current X will have to reckon with this past [which is definitely the past and has nothing to do with the present]5. Year [declassified documents] + 30: Yeah, everyone knew that X was doing Y all along, idiot. It was a different time back then and nothing about it is comparable to our current times. reply yetanotherloss 17 hours agorootparentThis is observed post hoc rationalization behavior for a lot of subjects, but it&#x27;s worth remembering that a lot of the kooky stuff from step 1 turns out to in fact be run of the mill lunacy, so there is some harsh survivorship bias. reply avgcorrection 16 hours agorootparentI was using the much-maligned term “conspiracy theory”, the term used to dismiss everyone from the well-read critic to the “kooky” Lizard International Government crank, but that was just to illustrate the point about how all of these get put under the same umbrella so that they at worst can be all summarily dismissed as dummies or at sort-of best can be equivocated by way of survivorship bias.In the Year Zero (before declassified documents) it&#x27;s not a bad theory that a powerful arm of one of the superpowers in a very free nation could be used for clandestine purposes since the State has a lot to gain from keeping the free men (people) of that nation from knowing about what it is really up to.Thankfully though we don&#x27;t need to guess at this point since we have history to back us up. reply Gibbon1 16 hours agorootparentprevOff hand thought an a small bit is a game of telephone. What people hear is completely mangled hearsay.Problem with intelligence agencies is no feedback to keep things same like you have when what people are doing is transparent.

It&#x27;s no one will ever know. reply caseysoftware 14 hours agorootparentprevYes.My only critique of your lifecycle is that in more recent times, \"Years\" should be replaced with \"Months\".. or sometimes Weeks. reply Chathamization 16 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think it’s unreasonable to say that while, conspiracy theorist tend to both greatly exaggerate what actually happened, and use things that we have evidence of to push wild conspiracies we have no evidence of.Let me give an example I just found. Because of this post, I looked at the Wikipedia page for MK Ultra and found this line:> The people under this interrogation were CIA employees, U.S. military personnel, and agents suspected of working for the other side in the Cold War. Long-term debilitation and several deaths resulted from this.Thought that was an interesting claim, so I checked the source - footnote 36 - which was Rappoport, J. (1995). \"CIA Experiments With Mind Control on Children\". Perceptions Magazine, p. 56. It took me a while to track that source down, but I found some pages that had it such as this one[1]:It claims that there was a vast effort to create children sleeper CIA agents in the U.S. to control America. The evidence is based on “recovered memories,” which is a defunct technique that in the 80’s lead to conspiracies about a nationwide underground Satanic movement that was secretly controlling the U.S. Those theories, this Rappaport article, and even some comments here all lean heavily on Operation Paperclip, with the implication that the scientists the U.S. brought over post-WWII created a secret Nazi movement within our own government.Looking at Rappaport’s website is interesting too. He believes the “Covid shots were kill shots” and that January 6 was a staged false flag event.That’s enough time spent on crazy for me today. It takes a ton of time to track down each of these individual sources like this. Honestly, it’s exhausting, and too many people think that some evidence of wrong doing decades ago is an invitation to shut down critical thought and open the door for all sorts of craziness.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20070608225401&#x2F;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.totse.c... [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nomorefakenews.com&#x2F; reply lazide 15 hours agorootparentCrazy gloms onto these things - both inside and outside the gov’t, and confusion is often used as a tool by ‘friends’ and adversaries.ARTICHOKE was the predecessor program to MKULTRA, and was explicitly to figure out how to trigger a cut-out to assassinate someone (especially high profile politicians). Here is the memo - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nsarchive.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2010&#x2F;04&#x2F;project-artich...(Copies of course, that I found googling around).These were real and dangerous programs. The CIA director explicitly ordered the destruction of all MKULTRA documents 2 years before Congress started to investigate it, after a suspicious and rather public death of one of the major Directors of the program. The only reason we have much documentation at all related to it is because several reports got misfiled and were missed during the shredder party, but were found later when the investigation got started. Unfortunately they were mainly financial overviews, not useful program documents.We know something very similar happened when Congress started looking into the CIA’s ‘extraordinary rendition’&#x2F;torture programs. Along with active interference in the investigation. And no consequences for anyone involved.So take that as you will. reply throw7 14 hours agorootparentCIA got better with cleaning up. Bikowsky and Haspel are ones I remember (maybe because they happened to be woman...). reply lazide 14 hours agorootparentI’m not sure being responsible&#x2F;involved with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Khalid_El-Masri is good. Maybe better than MKULTRA? Seems dubious though. They did finally release him instead of ‘disappearing’ him though. So that is one point in their favor I guess?To your point, better I guess? Still a sad and unconscionable thing for the gov’t to be doing IMO. reply almatabata 17 hours agorootparentprevIt all comes down to how much proof you require before you believe something. Some people do not require iron clad proof before they agree something looks fishy. Others require a very high level of proof before they agree something happened. If you require a high degree of proof you will always have to wait for declassified documents or leaks before you agree on anything.I can understand why people chose to wait. You have so many different conspiracies and most people simply do not have the time to sift through hundreds of documents to make yourself an opinion. People already barely have the time to read the news let alone follow the conspiracy rabit hole. Most people simple chose to wait and see.It does get annoying when people immediately dismiss any doubts you have as conspiracy nonsense though. Most people believe in some form of conspiracy without realizing it. How many agree that Epstein did not kill himself? reply avgcorrection 17 hours agorootparent> It all comes down to how much proof you require before you believe something.Not really. It&#x27;s about making educated guesses based on history. If some institution (a totally hypothetical one) has consistently worked a certain way based on proof for decades then you can expect it to be more likely for it to continue to do so. So if this institution tends to lie 95% of the time based on the evidence, which is more reasonable?1. Maintain the stance that they might be lying with a high likelihood2. Assume good faith until iron-clad evidence to the contrary (X years later). Then after that, of course, in any new scenario keep assuming good faith because there has been no FOIA or release of declassified documents yet reply almatabata 16 hours agorootparentI agree that probably they currently have many illegal programs ongoing or in the works. But that does not tell you the exact purpose of these programs. Which of these conspiracies actually hit upon an accurate piece of information and which extrapolated a bit too far? I have zero trust in the CIA but that does not really help to judge which leaks have merit. Just because the CIA lies 95% of the time does not mean that other people cannot lie and fake documents. reply avgcorrection 15 hours agorootparent> Just because the CIA lies 95% of the time does not mean that other people cannot lie and fake documents.What material difference does this make? You&#x27;re just muddying the waters. I presented a case for what kind of default stance is reasonable to take based on the available evidence. Not that one should believe everything anyone says about the CIA.Say that the CIA provably (documented) killed 20 particular innocent people (hypothetically). Then there are five people who each claim that the CIA killed whoever (their cousin, their wife) innocent people based on no evidence. The takeaway from that is that the CIA has killed innocent people (and by extension: can do it again), not that you should believe your uncle when he says that the CIA killed his dog. reply redeeman 12 hours agorootparenthmm very good point, that being said, I would probably tend to put more stock in the word of an honest normal person, than a proven murderous organisation accountable to nobody, but that may just be me reply mcpackieh 16 hours agorootparentprev> I have zero trust in the CIA but that does not really help to judge which leaks have merit.Fair. So when somebody shares their pet theory about the CIA doing some shit and they don&#x27;t have evidence on hand, how do you respond?\"I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true. It might be true but I&#x27;m not persuaded of it.\"\"That&#x27;s a conspiracy theory, it isn&#x27;t true.

So when somebody shares their pet theory about the CIA doing some shit > and they don&#x27;t have evidence on hand, how do you respond?Me personally i would listen just out of curiosity as long as it stayed civil. Most of the time it does so most of the time you can just listen and decide if you want to take it on board.> I&#x27;m not accusing you personally of this, but the second kind of response is > very common.I agree yes. People forget just how crazy certain theories sounded at the time. With MKULTRA you had the government giving hard drugs to citizen to see if they could brainwash them.

Not FISA like rubber stamping, which BTW came out of the Church commission investigations).3) classified information would have very short timeframes before mandatory publication (at most a decade)4) people would actually go to jail for abuses.None of which happens. reply avgcorrection 15 hours agorootparent> I’m saying that the public tolerates this situation (and the CIA et al use the classification system this way) because the public prefers feeling a certain way about what their government is doing, over knowing what their government is doing.Based on what evidence? Think about what you are saying.1. The clandestine arms of the US government has hidden things from the public2. But this was because the public wanted itExplain how (2) came about.The US was much more open about things like the Vietnam War because there was virtually no public opposition at the start of it. Then a culture of opposition eventually emerged. When Reagan took office his administration interferred in Latin America. But then they found out that they couldn&#x27;t just do that in the open like in the past because there was too much public opposition. So the operations had to be more clandestine.Public interest in US government operations abroad directly lead to a more clandestine approach—the exact opposite effect that you are claiming.> Nominally, if the public cared more about what was actually happening:And these things would come about how? Again, you&#x27;re missing a step and somehow think that the public can will these concrete legislations into effect. How?The US government has been around for centuries while what could be called universal democracy only came about in the 1960&#x27;s (arguably). And what democracy? A stronger one than pre-WWII, but still an elite-ruled democracy. reply lazide 15 hours agorootparentMy position is de-facto true - if it weren’t, after the Snowden leaks (among others), the next round of representatives&#x2F;President would have as their top issue disbanding the NSA&#x2F;CIA no?

Because most folks didn’t want to look or know.After all, the evidence in those leaks is damning. And they were very widely distributed. And they shows large scale illegal spying on the US population, abuse of power (spying on ex’s being one well documented behavior), lying to Congress and the American public, etc.Instead, Snowden has been actively hunted down as a traitor (with pronouncements of him as a public enemy being common), a token investigation was done which resulted in no actual changes or actions except for the Director of the NSA being brought up to (verifiably) lie to Congress and the Public, and some hand waving pronouncements that they totally stopped doing what they denied doing in the first place. And then they made sure to be more clandestine. Which Congress and the public never tried to stop them from doing!The US public wants to be ‘safe’ and know their government is ‘protecting them’, and ‘the bad guys are getting punished’.

If the federal government tells the public a theory about a group of men who conspired to hijack four airliners and crash them into buildings on the same day, that is literally a conspiracy theory but isn&#x27;t considered to be a conspiracy theory in the twisted colloquial sense of the word because the government endorses it as truth.And it&#x27;s not really about the evidence. How many people have personally sifted through all the evidence before deciding what to believe? Few people have the time, inclination and access. Instead people delegate that responsibility, usually to the government. The veracity of the evidence is taken on faith. For instance, how many people who take the 9&#x2F;11 Commission Report as truth have even read the report itself, let alone reviewed all the evidence that supposedly backs it up? I think not many. How many people who believe the report have also heard that intact passports from four of the hijackers were supposedly found in the rubble of the fiery wrecks?

He apparently was working on a specific program called ARTICHOKE in 1953 that involved torture and assassination using the MKULTRA arsenal of drugs and poisons:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wariscrime.com&#x2F;new&#x2F;scientist-frank-olson-killed-by-t...Of particular interest is this:> \"Cournoyer also told them Olson learned biological weapons, including anthrax, were used during the Korean War, despite denials by the U.S. government. Cournoyer repeated his story in a 2002 German TV documentary film, “Code Name ARTICHOKE,” which can be seen on YouTube.\"That would be enough of a reason for the CIA to conduct an assassination. It didn&#x27;t become public that the USA had collected all of Japan&#x27;s biological warfare data and given Shiro Ishii, head of that program, amnesty for his Mengele-like crimes until the 1970s. If all that had been revealed in 1953, it would have made US denial of the use of biological weapons in North Korea much less plausible.For more background on Olson and the CIA, this paper (Kuzmarov 2020) looks good:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;48645495> \"In 1947, Olson and Rosebury produced a technical monograph after constructing a special chamber for the study of “airborne clouds of highly infective agents” that recommended the use of airplanes as the “best delivery systems for biological agents.” In May of the previous year, members of Congress hoping to secure support for a $4.6 million naval appropriations bill, leaked to the Associated Press news about a “new germ spray capable of wiping out large cities and entire crops at a single blow, a secret weapon” deliverable from high-flying planes, “far more deadly than the atomic bomb.”\"I can guess what happened: under the influence of an unexpected dose of LSD, Olson (a previously straight-laced company man by all accounts) suddenly realized that he didn&#x27;t want to spend his life making bioweapons and torture&#x2F;assassination tools. Outcomes like that had a lot to do with the CIA giving up on LSD (as well as its later criminalization by the state). reply mcpackieh 16 hours agoparentIt seems to be a popular belief that biological weapons research was abandoned by all rational governments because biological weapons can&#x27;t be controlled and the infections would travel back to their source. But anthrax doesn&#x27;t have this problem. The spores are highly infectious, if you dust an area with anthrax spores it has a devastating effect. But at the same time, anthrax is barely contagious from person-to-person. If you take basic hazmat precautions and burn the bodies, there is little risk of the anthrax spreading out of control. The area spores were dropped on may remain deadly for decades, but that won&#x27;t spontaneously spread to other areas. It&#x27;s a practical and effective biological weapon.In 1972, the Soviets accidentally released a cloud of anthrax spores from from one of their research&#x2F;production facilities. It killed at least 68 people in that area, maybe many more, but didn&#x27;t spread uncontrollably through the population. reply logicchains 15 hours agorootparent> biological weapons can&#x27;t be controlled and the infections would travel back to their sourceIf a country found a way to make a racially-targeted bioweapon they could avoid that. Or a bioweapon for which only they had a vaccine&#x2F;antidote. reply reaperman 12 hours agorootparent> racially-targeted bioweaponPossible with relatively low specificity and sensitivity (high false positives, high false negatives, respectively). But society&#x27;s concept of \"race\" is nearly exclusively limited to physical appearance and has no basis in any part of the genotype which doesn&#x27;t affect visual phenotype. Therefore to achieve high specificity and sensitivity you&#x27;d need a bioweapon which targets individuals based on complex combinations of genes which together govern physical appearance, often in relatively subtle ways.This is relatively impossible because overall physical appearance isn&#x27;t a vector for infections. Even if you did this relatively impossible thing, you&#x27;d get a lot of false positives and negatives for most populations due to intermixing -- Latin America for example has very, very few groups of indigenous populations which aren&#x27;t significantly mixed with the European colonizers&#x27; genes.When I say it&#x27;s \"possible with relatively low specificity and sensitivity\" I mean that you could find other genes that are somewhat loosely correlated with our current definitions of \"race\", such as how some Africans are somewhat more likely to have sickle-cell disease (SCD) and that provides about a 75% protection against HIV, and heterogenous carriers of the gene (SCT - Sickle Cell Trait) have about 40% lower incidence rate of HIV. But even in the most concentrated areas of Africa, only 3% of some populations have SCD.And that dismal math will repeat for any \"race-based\" infection system -- you might be able to get slightly higher rates of infection in another target \"race\" but it won&#x27;t be dramatically different enough from the effects on your constituent population to make it useful. reply logicchains 15 hours agoprevI suspect if the US collapses the remains will probably end up ruled by someone from the intelligence agencies, like what happened with Putin in Russia.

Ranks somewhere between caffeine and amphetamine in efficacy and side effects.I’m much more comfortable with service members being given modafinil than amphetamine.Modafinil can still cause an increase in risk-taking behavior (certainly did for me), but if you absolutely need to be awake and functioning for 30-70 hours at a time it’s probably the least worst option. I’ve tried most stimulants, legal and illegal, and have had jobs that required me to be awake for 70+ hours straight in an environment not so different from military work (minus encounters with hostile forces).I think the most right solution is “don’t put people in positions where they have to work more than 14 hours or stay awake more than 20 hours” but while that is possible for corporations to guarantee to workers, it’s not always possible for militaries to guarantee to soldiers. reply bookofjoe 17 hours agorootparent... or to doctors anywhere reply hindsightbias 17 hours agoparentprevMany might do better to focus on advocacy rather than ignorance.

It&#x27;s not hard to find historical examples of mass delusions or bouts of madness in large populations. Sometimes something like a severe drought (hunger) convinces an entire society that human sacrifice is a good idea in order to improve the weather.Why wouldn&#x27;t similar things cause most people to break when a team of people are working to break them, with the aid of drugs and otherwise to make the trauma seem real? reply krapp 17 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s a difference between breaking someone and breaking them in a specific way that allows them to be controlled. As far as I know, the MKULTRA documents themselves show their experiments to be a failure. Pumping someone full of LSD then playing \"kill the President\" over headphones doesn&#x27;t work.The closest working analogue I can come up with to MKULTRA&#x27;s goals is cult indoctrination, and that only works so long as someone remains within the cult&#x27;s sphere of influence. reply chrisco255 15 hours agorootparentWell a contrived example of a bad or ineffective technique is not a counter point. Nor, of course, is MKULTRA docs themselves that claim ineffectiveness, whatever small, unredacted amount of which we&#x27;re privvy to.People do break and defect to other countries all the time. It happened numerous times on both sides during the Cold War. Surely part of that process is convincing your captive or target that your side&#x27;s \"cause or mission\" is better than the one they came from.To what extent is that even wrong I don&#x27;t know. What is a culture but a cult on a grander scale (as has sometimes been said of religion)? Not all cults need be death cults.You can&#x27;t just tell someone to do something repetitiously and they blindly follow the order.

The undergrad model relys on massive classes, I don’t see how you can do oral exams in those 300 person classes without massive cheating as the first students tell everyone else what to expect. reply wodenokoto 15 minutes agorootparentMost oral exams I&#x27;ve been to have been either a) talk about a report you&#x27;ve written, or b) draw 1 of x (say 8) subjects that have been covered throughout the year, and do a presentation on it, usually with 20-30 minutes preparation. All subjects have of course been published at least 2 weeks prior to the exam.So I don&#x27;t see a problem with telling \"what to expect\", but I do see a problem with 1 professor and one censor examining 300 students for for 30 minutes each. reply madmax96 7 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn’t matter if students know what to expect.An oral exam isn’t the same as reading a written exam out loud. There are a set of learning outcomes defined in the syllabus. The examiner uses the learning outcomes to ask probing questions that start a conversation - emphasis on conversation. A conversation can’t be faked. A simple follow up question can reveal a student only has a shallow understanding of material. Or, the student could remember everything they’ve been told, but fail to make connections between learning outcomes. You can’t cram for an oral exam. You have to digest the course material and think about what things mean in context.After all, students know what to expect on standardized tests. Some still do better than others :-). reply nicbou 15 hours agorootparentprevOne thing I don&#x27;t understand is that despite automating more and more of the work away, we seem to have fewer and fewer humans available for anything that&#x27;s left. I have to scan my own groceries, I can&#x27;t ever talk to an actual human at any business, I order my food from a machine.Where is everyone? reply vineyardmike 12 hours agorootparentAs you may have heard, in the US at least, there’s record low unemployment. There’s literally not enough people to do those jobs. It’s complex why…1. Demographic changes means more retirees, and smaller workforce. Literally less people to go around.2. With low unemployment, everyone’s doing something else. Something harder to automate, or otherwise more valuable. It’s not like people are sitting around unemployed (except retirees).What are they doing? It’s hard to know without combing through data in this moment, but people are surely avoiding minimum wage and low skill customer service jobs if alternatives exist in their area. Anecdotally, I hear people don’t like working in anything customer facing due to rude customers. I know someone in TX working at Amazon warehouses at an hourly rate much higher than retail workers rate. They used to work at a gym in rural California.Until we get rising low-skill immigration to cover more of the low-wage work, expect service work to be understaffed. Or rising birth rates, or a drop in white collar workers. reply Tanoc 4 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just that people are going for \"better\" jobs to avoid the lowest of low tier schlock jobs. It&#x27;s that a dedicated chunk of those jobs refuse to hire because the employers are trying to downsize that part of their overall workforce and thus reduce costs. An example of this has been the rail shortage, where despite needing twice as many workers as they actually have in order to keep things from collapsing the rail companies are ignoring the collapse and trying to cut fifty or even hundred car trains down to single man crews.You also cannot trust the Department Of Labor&#x27;s official statistics by themselves since there&#x27;s multiple ways that the U.S. government covers up actual unemployment numbers. For example stay at home parents aren&#x27;t included in the unemployment statistic even if they worked previous to that situation. People who have been unemployed for more than a year are not included. People on disability but who are in an employable state are not included. Gig workers such as GrubHub drivers are not included. Certain methods of self-employment such as traveling musicians are are not included. They pulled this trick a decade ago and they&#x27;re doing it again to try and prevent another panic. The one difference this time is that instead of people losing a single full-time job like they did in 2008, many are now working multiple part-times and thus inflating the employment statistic slightly since technically they&#x27;re never unemployed.Then there&#x27;s the gap that happens for employees. If someone has a part-time job and gets scheduled from noon to nine for closing back to back for four days and then gets nothing for the next three days that means they&#x27;re not getting paid the equivalent of a full-time job despite possibly working just as many if not more hours. When you have lulls like this you need a second part-time job to fill them in, leading to things like ten percent of the current counted national workforce having at least two jobs. But many part-time jobs in retail and services want to monopolize the person&#x27;s time since scheduling is based on the employer&#x27;s availability and not the employee&#x27;s, meaning that sometimes the employee will have to purposely dedicate days of their week to waiting in case either job calls them in. If the person doesn&#x27;t have a free day and are called in while working one of their two jobs, they may be fired from the other job. When enough places and people have an incongruent schedule like this places run short staffed and the person is still wasting a day or maybe more idle. Then there&#x27;s the other half of that coin of scheduling abuse, the supposed part-time job that uses that flexible scheduling to transform into a full-time job. I know that Wal-Mart will schedule you for no more than thirty hours a week and will stack your shifts back to back, sometimes with as little as eight hours in-between, just so they have enough leftover hours in your schedule that they can call you back to cover someone without pushing you into full-time or paying overtime. This makes working for Wal-Mart hell because you&#x27;re rushed and then all but told to be on standby, giving you very little time for things like other jobs, appointments, household chores, and even self care. The end result of being yanked between two part-times or being held hostage by a full-time masquerading as a part-time is that eventually the potential employee gets cynical and stops applying for that kind of work entirely. reply Meekro 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve wondered about this myself. It&#x27;s not just grocery scanning-- my parents used to get a bunch of bills in the mail every month, and send out a bunch of checks to pay them. It&#x27;s stunning to think about how many people were needed at every step of that pipeline to make the whole thing work.

No, I do not find a massive classroom better than an online lecture. Actually worse. The advantage of a classroom over a video lecture is the ability to interrupt and ask questions.

Generally you stop taking classes at the end of year 2 in your PhD, which is equivalent to a masters. The distinction of the PhD is that you are learning to learn on your own. This does add extra context to why grad students ask for higher pay, especially at the non-conditional and candidate levels, as they&#x27;re actually taking less resources from the school. E.g.

Peers that you can meet and discuss both study-related and unrelated topics.3. Language. Not relevant for intros, but advanced topics can be explained in more than one way, and as a student you not necessarily will be able to map between them.4. Schedule. Self-pacing 6 different classes for 12 weeks may be harder than it looks. Instead, you can just attend classes.5. Advanced topics. Online resources, especially videos become scarcer as you advance in your studies, more so if you are not in hot topic (e.g., CS). I still have some notes from classes I took as undergrad as a best source for the learned topics. Good luck finding video lectures about diagrammatic approach to real time dynamics of open spin systems.Same goes the other way around, sometimes attending class is just not worth it, even without tons of online courses.

Basically everyone wants to go to college. Many can get in. But not everyone is cut out for it. Those classes are usually decently challenging but mostly lectures. They cut out the people who should not be there or are not ready for it. They are also decently big because almost all of the curriculum paths require these core classes.

But the best they can ever do is show familiarity.What I really want as a consumer of someone&#x27;s grade or academic history is how well they WORK in the subject area, along with how well they work with other people, not just a score that may correlate with regurgitation of facts.I feel cheated by my school years, because I was led to believe that regurgitation of facts is very important.

What he wanted to see was that you&#x27;d be able to apply the course material to novel situations. He&#x27;d meet with every student during the course of longer term projects, just to get some insight into their work.Ultimately, it wouldn&#x27;t have scaled well beyond the 50-odd of us were in his course, but it was certainly AI proof.At the time, I thoroughly enjoyed it because it drove the kids who were hyper-fixated on grades and point grubbing up a wall.

School isn’t always about work, and not all education should be about work or jobs or whatever.That’s why I really like that you included how well they work with others.Personally, I never felt like school was about memorizing facts (maybe some history classes…), but I also had two parents with advanced degrees who repeatedly told me that school was about learning to think and learning to learn (and learning to time manage). I feel like the vocational focus a lot of people have on education really hurts some fields of study - the humanities gets a lot of hate both on HN and in the media.Ideally, classes with projects and essays should push people to think and show understanding of the subject not facts, like you said. The infinitely mocked “why did the author say the curtains were green” tropes actually show this - understanding why authors use certain imagery requires understanding intent, historic context, deeper understanding, etc. especially when applied to new works. I think people like cut and dry fact memorization and objective grading, and this doesn’t fit that cleanly. reply smrtinsert 14 hours agoparentprevCollege admissions have known this for a long time which is why test scores aren&#x27;t an automatic entrance.

You know... learning.There&#x27;s not a lot of value in using AI for targeted tasks like a school essay. Nor is there much value in getting a grade for a targeted task like an essay (not only would the grade be high-noise and low-signal, it also has a tiny or non-existent practical effect).I wonder if these AI tools will to some extent highlight the meaningless fluff (crust?) that vestigially hangs around. If our current incarnation of task-oriented AI is really good at some particular thing, and we humans readily hand that thing over to AI without regret&#x2F;loss, what are the chances that that thing really mattered in the first place?(Note that this is not to hypothesize that all things AI does are non-important.)I personally believe that we have a weak grasp on the things we do that don&#x27;t matter. We do a lot of things because we have always done them, and some of these have not been adequately questioned in years&#x2F;decades. So any indication of what&#x27;s important or not is very helpful.(I&#x27;m aware my circumstances are unique – maybe for some grades in school have had a significant influence in their lives – I personally have not witnessed this, in myself or others.) reply tracerbulletx 15 hours agoprevThis kind of thing infuriates me so much.

Either they can, or can&#x27;t, trust the Eagle to be honest.IMHO, that trust should be a necessary condition for awarding Eagle.And if the council isn&#x27;t capable of making that call, then they&#x27;re perhaps unqualified for deciding whether or not to award Eagle rank.(I realize my position is a bit simplistic. I paired it down for brevity.) reply garciasn 16 hours agorootparentThe council-level Eagle Board of Reviewers likely didn&#x27;t know the individual scouts and were simply applying their individual knowledge about the content reviewed compared to the whole and made, in this case, poor assumptions about the quality of writing they should expect.As it relates to academia today, this is now happening at a larger scale with folks lacking more trust, not having to think critically about the individual, and applying a similar outcome based on this. This all goes back to critical thought, understanding your audience, and using tools&#x2F;knowledge in a way it shouldn&#x27;t be used; it&#x27;s just now being used more often and with less control than ever.To address your specific comment that those folks may not have been qualified to assess scouts attempting to obtain Eagle, I cannot speak to that, but at the face of it, it would absolutely seem they were definitely not exposed to enough quality writing nor did they have the wherewithal to make decisions at the level they were tasked. Working in the business world, I am continually faced with a wide swath of college-educated adults who simply are unable to write coherently, so none of it surprises me today, but it certainly did when I was 15-16 and thought adults were more capable than actually were&#x2F;are.I still hate the world. reply godelski 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve started referring to this phenomena as \"Goodhart&#x27;s Hell.\" We&#x27;re living in a world with quickly increasing complexity. Variance in samples is much larger because our reach in what we sample is larger (we talk to people far from our homes, with different cultures, interpretations of words, language patterns, behaviors, ethics, etc). But we&#x27;ve responded to this only by simplifying our evaluations. We&#x27;ve created more tools and metrics that can help guide us, but we don&#x27;t use them as guides but answers. We&#x27;re using mathematics&#x2F;technology not as a tool or language, but a black box. A black box with high accuracy too! Noise&#x2F;uncertainty has increased but so has our confidence in our answers. It is entirely unwarranted. In essence, we are just hacking metrics and over-fitting our models to increase laziness and comfort. Our ever pursuit of meritocracy ironically takes us further from achieving the goals because we are unwilling to embrace the noise that is inherent to the system, believing that the noise is a lie, believing we can accurately measure everything to absolute (or even meaningful) precision. We have not only abandoned nuance but have actively turned against it and I do not know why. I think it deserves the hell in its name. reply fluoridation 12 hours agorootparentIn part it&#x27;s due to requirements of transparency. If some stranger is going to be evaluating you, a simple way to ensure that you&#x27;re not being evaluated unfairly is to have the evaluation criteria be very simple, almost to the point of being mechanistic. If you&#x27;re part of a small enough community it&#x27;s likely that your evaluator, their overseer, and your peers all know you, so it&#x27;s very difficult for unfairness to creep in unnoticed. If your community is gigantic everyone starts to be strangers to everyone else, so people can&#x27;t intuitively know whether someone is being treated unfairly or not. When everyone knows each other it&#x27;s much more difficult to game the system, because people can tell when you&#x27;ve been lazying around. reply godelski 16 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t disagree with this response. It&#x27;s actually a good one. But I think we need to be really aware of the trade-offs here. My problem is that people use these metrics as if they are hard proof of competence. But the truth is you have to pick your noise: nepotism or lazy evaluation. Either way, you aren&#x27;t getting rid of noise.I actually think scale is part of the problem here. In small communities there is more natural nuance and correction as there&#x27;s high accountability. But with scale accountability often disappear as you disappear into the crowd. And you&#x27;ll always be able to point at winners and losers to whichever noise you favor. The problem is we&#x27;re not looking at things holistically and ensuring that our metrics are aligned with our desired outcomes. Instead we often pick a metric because it reasonably looks like it should align with the desired outcome (not proven, just intuited) and then just tell anyone that disagrees that it is obvious instead of acknowledging the downsides. Every metric has limitations. Ignoring them is the problem. reply lozenge 14 hours agorootparentprevBut, they don&#x27;t have any knowledge.

According to them, instead of trying to figure out why I was attending and turning in the assigned work, they just tossed it. I don&#x27;t respect truly lazy people, and that was truly lazy.

So I wrote some kind of a bleeding heart piece about the prevalence of violence and war in the world or whatnot.I was quite pleased with it. Of course it was probably naive teenager stuff, exactly the kind you&#x27;d think is pretty smart when you&#x27;re in high school, but I felt good about it at the time. I also felt the English was pretty good, which of course was the point of the assignment. And I pulled it off in some kind of a flow state I conjured up at the last moment.The teacher didn&#x27;t think I had written it. She asked me if I had got the text from some IT firm or something. (This was around the dotcom boom, and I probably seemed like an obvious nerd. Those local dotcom firms had the image of being at the forefront of internationalization and anglicization. I still don&#x27;t know why she&#x27;d think IT firms would make a point of writing high school English essays for nerds.)It was my mistake, of course, and I understand her suspicion because I turned in something that didn&#x27;t conform to the specific assignment at all.

But I’m still a bit surprised — surely if you are getting a coursework essay from a history or English student or similar, the AI will be a worse writer and won’t have sufficiently detailed knowledge to write about the topic, so either the essay won’t really make any sense if you think about it (which you’d hope examiners would be able to tell) or the student will have done their own research and gotten the AI to form the students opinions into the essay, but they will then likely synthesise a much worse essay than the one the student could have written.Doing practicals seems good, and I think proctored examinations can add objectivity too. reply 2ap 12 hours agorootparentI agree - out of the box, a LLM will write an extremely poor essay. But that is not how to use the LLM. WHat you do, is give the topic to the LLM, and say, \"with this topic, what are 20 titles that I could have for essays.\" Then, you pick the best title, and you then say, \"I am writing an essay with the title , what should the central argument for the essay be?\" You then ask for a list of bullet points for the central theme of each paragraph to elaborate on that argument, then you ask it to write each paragraph individually, then you put the pieces together, and ask it to proof read it&#x27;s own work and finally you add in some references of your own. Within 1&#x2F;2 an hour, you have a passable essay. And if you then iterate on it with the LLM you can fairly soon have a half decent one, especially if it is a well trodden area (presumably with lots of training data that the LLM draws on).I tried to get students to critique things, but even then you can put in the text to critique to a LLM with a long enough context, and the LLM will kick off with a passable critique, if you iterate with it enough.So, even though they&#x27;ll never get a top mark, they will still be able to get through the assessment.

Similarly, I don&#x27;t know how to tell if an essay was AI written... but neither do the AI detectors, and it is unethical for professors to rely on them to make decisions about plagiarism.When you have an unsolved problem and someone proposes a bad solution with bad consequences, what you end up with is the same unsolved problem, still unsolved, plus a newly created additional problem on top of it from your bad solution. You started with the problem of rampant plagiarism and cheating, now you have both a problem with rampant plagiarism and cheating, and a new problem with making baseless accusations of cheating against potentially honest students with no real evidence. reply paulddraper 9 hours agorootparentThat is perhaps longest possible way I&#x27;ve ever seen to say \"I don&#x27;t know\" reply danShumway 7 hours agorootparentIf that is really your only takeaway from what I wrote then I apologize that the comment didn&#x27;t elaborate more. replysigmar 16 hours agoparentprev>3 different checkers that I found online and if they don&#x27;t all agree then I don&#x27;t call it plagiarismHow do you verify these \"different checkers\" aren&#x27;t all going to the same api or using the same software?

How is AI any different? Some trust is in order here. The students are the ones paying to be educated, if they cheat they are only cheating themselves anyways. reply Miraste 17 hours agoparent>if they cheat they are only cheating themselves anyways.I&#x27;ve heard people say this a lot. It&#x27;s a very old-school liberal arts perspective that doesn&#x27;t fit with the modern world. In practice, for most students, education is a third-place benefit of university behind 1. the certificate and 2. networking. reply fnordpiglet 15 hours agorootparentI find the “liberal arts” thing weird. First, as a scientist with an engineering degree, I definitely feel if you cheat through school you’re only cheating yourself. In the hard sciences a lack of knowledge and ability is pretty easy to suss out. The degree gets you the interview, the network might open a door or two, but the education is how you get the job. And once you’ve got it, if you didn’t learn anything, you will be fired fast.It’s more likely in a liberal art you can fluff your way through life living a continuous con. But heres the thing - they still are cheating themselves. Because the only thing a certificate and a network based on lies gives you is hollow employment built on lies. The education is what gives you a career and a life worth living.So, maybe that’s old school, but I’ve rarely found old school wisdom to be wrong. It has, after all, withstood the filter of time. reply 9dev 13 hours agorootparent> The degree gets you the interview, the network might open a door or two, but the education is how you get the job.What a great way to respond. I couldn’t agree more. reply yunwal 12 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it’s not true for most positions in the tech industry, including the highest paying ones. All of these are game-able. Spend a month running through leetcode questions and learning some jargon, and it won’t matter whether you cheated your way through school, you’ll know enough to pass the interview.Even on the job people can often get away with not providing much value if they have a bad&#x2F;apathetic&#x2F;misaligned manager. reply jncfhnb 14 hours agorootparentprevI’m just glad people have stopped saying liberal arts students are the only ones who have learned to think critically reply seabass-labrax 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a curious choice to call the liberal arts \"they are only cheating themselves\" attitude old-school. One could debate whether the certificate-motivated or culture-motivated type of university came first.I suspect that advanced hunter-gatherer and early agricultural societies viewed education more as purely motivated by culture: basic useful life skills can be passed on informally within communities or families (so formal education is not strictly necessary for survival), and typical tasks would unlikely to be a risk to others if done incorrectly (making certificates valueless).However, the modern Western university could arguably originate from the Church (and Jewish institutions before that), in which the education would surely have been considered necessary to correctly interpret texts. In that context, the certificate is a reassurance to the general, uneducated public that they are being led by qualified spiritual leaders (the clergy).Once you get to the Renaissance and towards the Enlightenment era, it seems as if the increasingly secular focus of education yet again reduces the necessity of certificates and makes broad, &#x27;polymathematic&#x27; science and culture more important. The certificates only become important in secular life again once the apprenticeship system breaks down in the late 19th century.Finally, the idea of a &#x27;liberal arts&#x27; course seems to be a reaction to keep the spirit of the Enlightenment alive despite ubiquitous industrialisation, so in this light is both an old school and a new school of though, depending on how you look at it!These are my thoughts from a very British perspective, so I would be curious to know whether that fits with views from other cultures, such as East Asian or predominantly Catholic ones. reply antifa 5 hours agorootparentprevI remember several classes I wish I could have taken, but classes aren&#x27;t free and I was already overloaded with useless \"required\" classes. reply fzzzy 17 hours agorootparentprevSo then who cares if they got an education?

I care that they actually got an education rather than cheated their way through it.These are all things I can&#x27;t personally judge competence in, because I&#x27;m not competent in medicine, psychology, engineering, etc. The most reasonable way for me to judge competence is whether an accredited school vouches for them via a degree. reply billy99k 16 hours agorootparentprevDo you want to compete with someone for a job that cheated to get an education and got the job over you?

But conversely, it isn&#x27;t the worst approach to take to evaluating people when you personally lack competence.As an example, I would never hire a programmer based on credentials. But it is often the first and only thing that I look for in a random doctor visit. reply yohannparis 17 hours agorootparentprevAgain, this is a north-americas point of view where most universities and colleges are \"private\" businesses. reply tatersolid 11 hours agorootparentAs I recall from my kid’s college search, the majority of US college students attend state schools or community colleges. While there are very many private colleges in number, they are each usually much smaller than state schools in enrollment. Private schools are also vastly outnumbered by community colleges, even though community colleges are on average smaller in enrollment.. reply analog31 17 hours agorootparentprevIf students believe that these are their only options, they are either tragically misled, or misleading themselves. reply Miraste 16 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t follow. Could you expand on that? reply analog31 11 hours agorootparentI perceive a widespread, cynical belief that the primary purposes of higher education are things like signaling, credentials, and networking. Students who accept this belief are whom I refer to as tragically misled. It&#x27;s not unthinkable that they&#x27;re in the majority. On the other hand, I think a fructifying education is up for grabs at virtually any college.I told my kids that a large state university is like a tiny elite academy, hidden in plain sight within a giant party school.Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I know many people had bad college experiences, and that higher education is ripe for reform. reply booleandilemma 17 hours agoparentprevThe students are the ones paying to be educated, if they cheat they are only cheating themselves anyways.The problem is the cheater will then enter into society and tell people \"I&#x27;m a graduate of $prestigious_university\".At that point they are cheating society.Would you want to work with people who cheated? Would you want your doctor to be someone who cheated? reply ElevenLathe 14 hours agorootparentThe world is filled with (some would say entirely composed of) people who are cheating society, usually in much much worse ways.Why would I care if I work with people who cheated at college? I work for a business that constantly cheats me, my coworkers, its customers, its suppliers, the government, and innocent people with no formal affiliation to the business at all. This is what businesses exist to do. The only people a business theoretically exists NOT to cheat is its investors, and their empirical record there is mixed at best.I&#x27;m not in any position to evaluate if a doctor is doing a good job or not (almost nobody is, not even doctors themselves), but in principle I am not opposed to their cheating if it doesn&#x27;t affect my \"care\" (i.e. my family doctor cheating on some exam about the esoterica of podiatry or some other specialty they would normally just refer me for). reply UniverseHacker 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, but it&#x27;s just one of a multitude of ways someone could cheat at work, including lying flat out about holding degrees (which in most cases isn&#x27;t even illegal), or simply faking their effort in the job, and not really doing it.If people are going to cheat themselves out of an education, and then cheat at a job... ultimately they will be &#x27;found out&#x27; for not doing their job properly. Unless there is absolutely no objective way to evaluate, measure, or observe job performance, in which case the job is probably nonsense anyway and cheating doesn&#x27;t matter. reply fzzzy 17 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t this already happen all the time? reply onemoresoop 17 hours agorootparentYes it does but it could be worse.

We&#x27;ve never been able to reduce the false positives to zero.Meanwhile, you owe your lawyer $350 for your initial consultation. reply singleshot_ 9 hours agorootparentImagine an automated plagiarism detector that functioned by decapitating the student, putting their brain in a blender, and examining the results. Could any contractual release that the student signed make this ok?You can disclaim negligence, but you can’t disclaim malice or recklessness. You might find that this contract is not worth very much, depending on the facts of exactly how stupid this software is and how hard the school tried to find out whether it was stupid or not. reply LanceH 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m skeptical. It might not make sense financially, but falsely accusing someone of something that wasn&#x27;t done isn&#x27;t absolved by using automated tools. It still requires a person to interpret the results and assess a penalty.Does the Code of Student Conduct say that plagiarism is bad? Or does it say that some secret program will assess the paper and be the sole judge of plagiarism? I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s not the latter.Personally, I would stand my ground and tell the professor straight up, \"I&#x27;m not writing it again, I&#x27;ve written it once.\" Leave them with the understanding of the hell to be paid for accusing me falsely.When I didn&#x27;t do the work, I accepted the bad grades -- I didn&#x27;t cheat.

They asked us stupid questions and tried to talk us out of our petition. When it didn&#x27;t work, they eventually caved and didn&#x27;t do the carpet that year.They waited for the next year. Then a couple years later, they put back the tile.I don&#x27;t know why they were so scared of our petition, but I&#x27;m sure this is another situation that could benefit from one.

So the worry is that the quality of education received will decrease.Example: no one cares that you wrote 5 pages on To Kill a Mocking Bird.

Some users of 1.1.1.1 or products like WARP, Zero Trust, or third party DNS resolvers which use 1.1.1.1 may have received SERVFAIL DNS responses to valid queries. We’re very sorry for this outage. This outage was an internal software error and not the result of an attack. In this blog, we’re going to talk about what the failure was, why it occurred, and what we’re doing to make sure this doesn’t happen again. Background In the Domain Name System (DNS), every domain name exists within a DNS zone. The zone is a collection of domain names and host names that are controlled together. For example, Cloudflare is responsible for the domain name cloudflare.com, which we say is in the “cloudflare.com” zone. The .com top-level domain (TLD) is owned by a third party and is in the “com” zone. It gives directions on how to reach cloudflare.com. Above all of the TLDs is the root zone, which gives directions on how to reach TLDs. This means that the root zone is important in being able to resolve all other domain names. Like other important parts of the DNS, the root zone is signed with DNSSEC, which means the root zone itself contains cryptographic signatures. The root zone is published on the root servers, but it is also common for DNS operators to retrieve and retain a copy of the root zone automatically so that in the event that the root servers cannot be reached, the information in the root zone is still available. Cloudflare’s recursive DNS infrastructure takes this approach as it also makes the resolution process faster. New versions of the root zone are normally published twice a day. 1.1.1.1 has a WebAssembly app called static_zone running on top of the main DNS logic that serves those new versions when they are available. What happened On 21 September, as part of a known and planned change in root zone management, a new resource record type was included in the root zones for the first time. The new resource record is named ZONEMD, and is in effect a checksum for the contents of the root zone. The root zone is retrieved by software running in Cloudflare’s core network. It is subsequently redistributed to Cloudflare’s data centers around the world. After the change, the root zone containing the ZONEMD record continued to be retrieved and distributed as normal. However, the 1.1.1.1 resolver systems that make use of that data had problems parsing the ZONEMD record. Because zones must be loaded and served in their entirety, the system’s failure to parse ZONEMD meant the new versions of the root zone were not used in Cloudflare’s resolver systems. Some of the servers hosting Cloudflare's resolver infrastructure failed over to querying the DNS root servers directly on a request-by-request basis when they did not receive the new root zone. However, others continued to rely on the known working version of the root zone still available in their memory cache, which was the version pulled on 21 September before the change. On 4 October 2023 at 07:00 UTC, the DNSSEC signatures in the version of the root zone from 21 September expired. Because there was no newer version that the Cloudflare resolver systems were able to use, some of Cloudflare’s resolver systems stopped being able to validate DNSSEC signatures and as a result started sending error responses (SERVFAIL). The rate at which Cloudflare resolvers generated SERVFAIL responses grew by 12%. The diagrams below illustrate the progression of the failure and how it became visible to users. Incident timeline and impact 21 September 6:30 UTC: Last successful pull of the root zone. 4 October 7:00 UTC: DNSSEC signatures in the root zone obtained on 21 September expired causing an increase in SERVFAIL responses to client queries. 7:57: First external reports of unexpected SERVFAILs started coming in. 8:03: Internal Cloudflare incident declared. 8:50: Initial attempt made at stopping 1.1.1.1 from serving responses using the stale root zone file with an override rule. 10:30: Stopped 1.1.1.1 from preloading the root zone file entirely. 10:32: Responses returned to normal. 11:02: Incident closed. This below chart shows the timeline of impact along with the percentage of DNS queries that returned with a SERVFAIL error: We expect a baseline volume of SERVFAIL errors for regular traffic during normal operation. Usually that percentage sits at around 3%. These SERVFAILs can be caused by legitimate issues in the DNSSEC chain, failures to connect to authoritative servers, authoritative servers taking too long to respond, and many others. During the incident the amount of SERVFAILs peaked at 15% of total queries, although the impact was not evenly distributed around the world and was mainly concentrated in our larger data centers like Ashburn, Virginia; Frankfurt, Germany; and Singapore. Why this incident happened Why parsing the ZONEMD record failed DNS has a binary format for storing resource records. In this binary format the type of the resource record (TYPE) is stored as a 16-bit integer. The type of resource record determines how the resource data (RDATA) is parsed. When the record type is 1, this means it is an A record, and the RDATA can be parsed as an IPv4 address. Record type 28 is an AAAA record, whose RDATA can be parsed as an IPv6 address instead. When a parser runs into an unknown resource type it won’t know how to parse its RDATA, but fortunately it doesn’t have to: the RDLENGTH field indicates how long the RDATA field is, allowing the parser to treat it as an opaque data element.1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+ || // / NAME / || +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+TYPE+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+CLASS+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+TTL|| +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+RDLENGTH+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--| / RDATA / // +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+ RFC 1035 The reason static_zone didn’t support the new ZONEMD record is because up until now we had chosen to distribute the root zone internally in its presentation format, rather than in the binary format. When looking at the text representation for a few resource records we can see there is a lot more variation in how different records are presented. . 86400 IN SOA a.root-servers.net. nstld.verisign-grs.com. 2023100400 1800 900 604800 86400 . 86400 IN RRSIG SOA 8 0 86400 20231017050000 20231004040000 46780 .

Because of this, the library we use to parse the root zone at the edge does not make an attempt at doing so, and instead returns a parser error. Why a stale version of the root zone was used The static_zone app, tasked with loading and parsing the root zone for the purpose of serving the root zone locally (RFC 7706), stores the latest version in memory. When a new version is published it parses it and, when successfully done so, drops the old version. However, as parsing failed the static_zone app never switched to a newer version, and instead continued using the old version indefinitely. When the 1.1.1.1 service is first started the static_zone app does not have an existing version in memory. When it tries to parse the root zone it fails in doing so, but because it does not have an older version of the root zone to fall back on, it falls back on querying the root servers directly for incoming requests. Why the initial attempt at disabling static_zone didn’t work Initially we tried to disable the static_zone app through override rules, a mechanism that allows us to programmatically change some behavior of 1.1.1.1. The rule we deployed was: phase = pre-cache set-tag rec_disable_static For any incoming request this rule adds the tag rec_disable_static to the request. Inside the static_zone app we check for this tag and, if it’s set, we do not return a response from the cached, static root zone. However, to improve cache performance queries are sometimes forwarded to another node if the current node can’t find the response in its own cache. Unfortunately, the rec_disable_static tag is not included in the queries being forwarded to other nodes, which caused the static_zone app to continue replying with stale information until we eventually disabled the app entirely. Why the impact was partial Cloudflare regularly performs rolling reboots of the servers that host our services for tasks like kernel updates that can only take effect after a full system restart. At the time of this outage, resolver server instances that were restarted between the ZONEMD change and the DNSSEC invalidation did not contribute to impact. If they had restarted during this two-week period, they would have failed to load the root zone on startup and fallen back to resolving by sending DNS queries to root servers instead. In addition, the resolver uses a technique called serve stale (RFC 8767) with the purpose of being able to continue to serve popular records from a potentially stale cache to limit the impact. A record is considered to be stale once the TTL amount of seconds has passed since the record was retrieved from upstream. This prevented a total outage; impact was mainly felt in our largest data centers which had many servers that had not restarted the 1.1.1.1 service in that timeframe. Remediation and follow-up steps This incident had widespread impact, and we take the availability of our services very seriously. We have identified several areas of improvement and will continue to work on uncovering any other gaps that could cause a recurrence. Here is what we are working on immediately: Visibility: We’re adding alerts to notify when static_zone serves a stale root zone file. It should not have been the case that serving a stale root zone file went unnoticed for as long as it did. If we had been monitoring this better, with the caching that exists, there would have been no impact. It is our goal to protect our customers and their users from upstream changes. Resilience: We will re-evaluate how we ingest and distribute the root zone internally. Our ingestion and distribution pipelines should handle new RRTYPEs seamlessly, and any brief interruption to the pipeline should be invisible to end users. Testing: Despite having tests in place around this problem, including tests related to unreleased changes in parsing the new ZONEMD records, we did not adequately test what happens when the root zone fails to parse. We will improve our test coverage and the related processes. Architecture: We should not use stale copies of the root zone past a certain point. While it’s certainly possible to continue to use stale root zone data for a limited amount of time, past a certain point there are unacceptable operational risks. We will take measures to ensure that the lifetime of cached root zone data is better managed as described in RFC 8806: Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver. Conclusion We are deeply sorry that this incident happened. There is one clear message from this incident: do not ever assume that something is not going to change! Many modern systems are built with a long chain of libraries that are pulled into the final executable, each one of those may have bugs or may not be updated early enough for programs to operate correctly when changes in input happen. We understand how important it is to have good testing in place that allows detection of regressions and systems and components that fail gracefully on changes to input. We understand that we need to always assume that “format” changes in the most critical systems of the internet (DNS and BGP) are going to have an impact. We have a lot to follow up on internally and are working around the clock to make sure something like this does not happen again.

Adding an alert for serving stale root zone data is great, but I think a few more would be very useful too:- There&#x27;s a clear uptick in SERVFAIL responses at 7:00 UTC but they don&#x27;t start their response until an hour later after receiving external reports. This uptick should have automatically triggered an alert. It can&#x27;t have been within the normal range because they got customer reports about it.- The resolver failed to load the root zone data on startup and resorted a fallback path. Even if this isn&#x27;t an error for the resolver it should still be an alert for the static_zone service, because its only client is failing to consume its data.- The static_zone service should also alert when some percentage of instances fail to parse the root zone data, to get ahead of potential problems before the existing data becomes stale. reply lopkeny12ko 4 hours agoparentThe alerts you suggested are sufficiently obvious that I&#x27;m sure the team has already implemented, or plans to implement, them. The public postmortem report is likely just a small snippet of the more interesting remediation actions. reply jrockway 7 hours agoparentprevSERVFAIL might not be a good enough signal for alerting. I definitely see third-party DNS providers returning SERVFAIL for their own reasons; if it&#x27;s a popular host (looking at you, Route 53), then you&#x27;ll proxy those through and end up alerting on AWS&#x27;s issue instead of your own.They might just want a prober; ask every server for cloudflare.com every minute. If that errors, there are big problems. (I remember Google adding itself as malware many many years ago. Nice to have a continuous check for that sort of thing, which I am sure they do now.) reply physicles 6 hours agorootparent> They might just want a prober; ask every server for cloudflare.com every minute. If that errors, there are big problems.Yeah this was my first thought too. Why don&#x27;t they have such a system in place for as many permutations of their public services as they can think of? We&#x27;re a small company and we&#x27;ve had this for critical stuff for several years. reply XorNot 5 hours agorootparentIn my experience it&#x27;s because the monitoring system is usually controlled by another team. So you they don&#x27;t know what they should be testing, and the developers who know how to do it aren&#x27;t easily able to set it up as part of deployment.Add issues like network-visibility, and you wind up talking about a cross-team, cross-org effort to stick an HTTP poller and get the traffic back to some server - and so going into production without it winds up being the easier path (because it&#x27;ll work fine - provided nothing goes wrong). reply RockRobotRock 9 hours agoparentprevnot to be glib but you should consider working for them reply throwawaaarrgh 7 hours agorootparentIf you can see shit falling apart and you&#x27;re not even inside the org, it&#x27;s probably a tire fire, and working there will just be stressful reply RockRobotRock 3 hours agorootparent\"shit falling apart\" is a little dramatic.

I tried to get in touch with Cloudflare to report this issue - but I haven&#x27;t found any meaningful contact other than Twitter.For such an important service, I&#x27;m impressed there is no contact email &#x2F; form where you can get in touch with the engineers responsible for keeping the service up and running.Other than that, kudos for the well written blog post - as always![1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;DenysVitali&#x2F;status&#x2F;1709476961523835246 reply lopkeny12ko 4 hours agoparentDo you truly believe that the turnaround time for you contacting support, speaking to a first-tier support agent, having the request escalated to engineering, having a support engineer triaging it to the right team, and finally having the report being gauged so urgent that it pages the oncall for that team, is faster than automated infrastructure monitoring that the teams already have?For something as core as DNS, I&#x27;m sure engineers were aware about the issue within minutes. There&#x27;s a lot of politics and processes between that and public acknowledgment of an incident. reply denysvitali 3 hours agorootparentThe timeline doesn&#x27;t mention any internal monitor system but \"external reports\".What I want as an engineer is an engineering contact (similar to a NOC) that \"normal customers\" aren&#x27;t aware of.Something as critical as DNS should have that - but maybe I expect too much from a free service. reply cj 8 hours agoparentprevThis sounds so foreign to my experience.Even when I just had 2 paid domains with Cloudflare, there was real time chat support that seemed to always have an available engineer when something came up.Maybe they don&#x27;t provide support like that to free users. reply abraham 7 hours agorootparentYou have to pay $200&#x2F;month for access to live chat support.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;plans&#x2F; reply denysvitali 3 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t even have a Cloudflare account.

How sentiment has changed in such a short period.My guess would be their weird ‘site protection’ stuff is burning too many people and negatively impacting their reputation. reply reaperman 11 hours agorootparentIn general, I always seem to find comments along the lines of this are very easy to thoroughly disprove. There has been consistent criticism of Cloudflare for many years, ever since the majority of web traffic started going through their anti-DDOS and anti-bot gateways.Here&#x27;s a HN post with lots of very critical comments[0] from 7 years ago, including a fairly scathing one from &#x27;tptacek. Even way back then, you&#x27;d get the same comments you hear today like:> So rather than demand fixes for the fundamental issues that enable ddos attacks (preventing IP spoofing, allowing infected computers to remain connected, etc), we just continue down this path of massive centralization of services into a few big players that can afford the arms race against bonnets. Using services like Cloudflare as a &#x27;fix&#x27; is wrecking the decentralized principles of the Internet. At that point we might as well just write all apps as Facebook widgets.0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13718947 reply kkielhofner 11 hours agorootparentprev> My guess would be their weird ‘site protection’ stuff is burning too many people and negatively impacting their reputation.What&#x27;s always been interesting to me about this take is it&#x27;s not as though Cloudflare is randomly inserting themselves in internet traffic.Cloudflare customers have choice in the marketplace and they chose Cloudflare for whatever reasons. If end-users take issue with accessing the site of a Cloudflare customer they should take it up with the owners of the site that chose Cloudflare. Theoretically the Cloudflare customer would take it up with them if it becomes problematic. Cloudflare has no obligation to the site end-users other than meeting the needs of their customer who does have obligation to their end-users (theoretically).Cloudflare is, ostensibly, providing a solution for their customers. How that impacts their customer&#x27;s end-users is between Cloudflare and the customer. reply throwaway67743 12 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never loved cloudflare - as someone doing this long before they existed I see through their wordy blog posts about rookie mistakes.

I&#x27;m saying the idea of someone providing hundreds of terabits of connectivity, connecting to over 12,000 networks, and supporting what is likely at least a billion users before Prince was born is completely absurd and impossible. There were only 118 million telephones worldwide in 1958 (the year Prince was born)[0].I&#x27;m not referring to \"DevOps crap\". I&#x27;m referring to a wide product suite of functionality and geographic spread and scale that at best even 20 years ago would have taken an army of sysadmins and developers to build and maintain with a staggering fleet of Linux boxes running LAMP or whatever you prefer.I was a very early Fastly customer (~2013 or so). I continue to look at them from time to time and what Oracle has done to them is atrocious (yet typical). They clearly have some usage and market share within that target market.Speaking of market share, Cloudflare gets the most attention because they (by far) have the largest market share in terms of CDN&#x2F;DDoS&#x2F;etc and anything they do has the most significant impact on internet users at large. Depending on your source Cloudflare has roughly 50% of \"CDN\" marketshare, Fastly has something in the single digit percent range. Even Amazon CloudFront is around half that of Cloudflare.Between Oracle and having less than 1&#x2F;10th the market share that&#x27;s why no one talks about Fastly. Compared to Cloudflare they&#x27;re essentially irrelevant unless you&#x27;re one of Oracle&#x27;s enterprise customers that will deal with their sales people and tactics.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.encyclopedia.com&#x2F;science-and-technology&#x2F;computer.... reply Liquid_Fire 1 hour agorootparent> in 1958 (the year Prince was born)I was confused at first how Prince is relevant, but it seems GP is referring to the CEO of Cloudflare, Matthew Prince, who was born in 1974.

I&#x27;m not sure why, but around a dozen people on HN have confirmed this. (At least as of a couple months ago.)I think the world could use more alternatives to 8.8.8.8. Hopefully 1.1.1.1 will become more reliable as the years tick by.(Do you use something besides 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1? If so, post it here!

Cloudflare believes this is better for privacy.Archive.is doesn&#x27;t like this (because it prevents DNS-based CDN routing), and thus has a hardcoded exception to intentionally return bogus results to Cloudflare&#x27;s resolvers. reply 542458 21 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s also worth noting that Cloudflare&#x27;s implementation is EDNS compliant. The EDNS extension for sending the client subnet is explicitly optional in the standard. reply silotis 20 hours agorootparentprevCloudflare&#x27;s lack of EDNS doesn&#x27;t prevent DNS based routing. It can still be done based on the DNS request&#x27;s source address. This will be the IP of the Cloudflare POP closest to the client.Lack of EDNS only makes DNS based routing slightly worse if your CDN has a POP density similar-or-greater-than Cloudflare&#x27;s. reply Scaevolus 19 hours agorootparentCorrect. Cloudflare&#x27;s POP routing is quite extensive, and I&#x27;d be shocked if archive.is had more than a handful of backends it&#x27;s routing to.Even so, why would an extra few dozen ms matter at all? Archive.is appears to be spindle-limited, is a client with marginally higher RTT an issue? The admin is silly.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cloudflare.com&#x2F;network&#x2F; reply jrochkind1 19 hours agorootparentIt seems so silly and mysterious that it makes me wonder if archive.today wants exact client IP addresses for some other unstated reason. (It&#x27;s not clear how&#x2F;if archive.today, a possibly illegal site, brings in revenue?).The whole thing is very odd. reply depr 19 hours agorootparentThere is another reason but it is stated here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36971650 (routing people to the nearest server _outside_ their own country). reply arkadiyt 19 hours agorootparentprev> it makes me wonder if archive.today wants exact client IP addresses for some other unstated reasonThey still get the client ip from the request to the service itself (unless you&#x27;re using a VPN, but if you&#x27;re using a VPN then archive wouldn&#x27;t get your ip from your DNS request either). reply mike_d 12 hours agorootparentprevDo you happen to have a mapping of Cloudflare IP space to physical POPs?To the best of my knowledge they do not publish this, which makes it quite a chore to track all their edge locations manually. reply tomrod 21 hours agorootparentprev> thus has a hardcoded exception to intentionally return bogus results to Cloudflare&#x27;s resolvers.This is a bad practice. reply giancarlostoro 20 hours agorootparentwhy in the world are they doing that I wonder. reply wlonkly 7 hours agorootparentExplanation is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36971650 reply sccxy 19 hours agorootparentprevPersonal hate against big tech companies? reply eli 20 hours agorootparentprevIt prevents DNS-based CDN routing in the particular way Archive wants to do it. reply handsclean 17 hours agorootparentprevThere are two missing facts here that change the story quite a bit:- In addition to not supporting EDNS, Cloudflare sends DNS requests from effectively random PoPs, so the recipient doesn’t know even the visitor’s nationality.- The reason archive.is doesn’t like this is it makes them vulnerable to DoS attack.Source and details: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36971650 reply andrewla 17 hours agorootparentprevIf I understand this correctly, that&#x27;s hilarious -- Cloudflare is essentially saying that nobody can layer their own cloudflare-like offering on top of their DNS. Edge-routing is their bread and butter!If you want to use the client&#x27;s IP geolocation to resolve a CNAME to an edge server, this blocks you from doing so. You have to buy Cloudflare&#x27;s products to get this benefit, and use their edge servers. reply NicoJuicy 17 hours agorootparentNo, they don&#x27;t, please read this before making unresearched guesses ( note: I had the same reaction at first a couple of years ago).They forward every info that is required for cdn&#x27;s to function, that&#x27;s why no other cdn&#x27;s are complaining.See the statement of the CEO:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19828317Tldr:> We publish the geolocation information of the IPs that we query from. That allows any network with less density than we have to properly return DNS-targeted results. For a relatively small operator like archive.is, there would be no loss in geo load balancing fidelity relying on the location of the Cloudflare PoP in lieu of EDNS IP subnets.We are working with the small number of networks with a higher network&#x2F;ISP density than Cloudflare (e.g., Netflix, Facebook, Google&#x2F;YouTube) to come up with an EDNS IP Subnet alternative that gets them the information they need for geolocation targeting without risking user privacy and security. reply andrewla 15 hours agorootparentThanks for the clarification and link!I do think that this has the effect of locking customers into Cloudflare&#x27;s geoip data, which seems a little sketchy. The operator of archive.is claims that the data itself is bad[1] but I can&#x27;t speak to his biases or motivations.If the data is incomplete or bad, then you gain an advantage by using Cloudflare&#x27;s services over rolling your own or using a competitor if a large number of customers are using their DNS, so I think the original point does stand. And if you are a competitor, your ability to compete with greater edge capacity or more targeted edge capacity is nonexistent.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;archiveis&#x2F;status&#x2F;1018691421182791680 reply NicoJuicy 15 hours agorootparentI would doubt the owner has a bigger network than cloudflare as their cdn.If you&#x27;re cdn is Azure, GCE, or AWS, than you&#x27;re cdn is spread over the regions that their cloud offers. You still have no use-case to know more.So, who? There isn&#x27;t a provider atm in the world. So the issue at hand is currently not existent, as far as I&#x27;m aware. reply andrewla 14 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s say you have more fine-grained capacity in a given metro than Cloudflare has in an attempt to provide additional value in that metro than Cloudflare can offer. You are blocked from doing so if endusers are using Cloudflare DNS.I don&#x27;t know if this is happening at the moment, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that there is no real incentive to even attempt this given that you simply will not be able to offer any benefits because you don&#x27;t have the data. reply NicoJuicy 8 hours agorootparentWho would set up ( or use) a dns that is better in 1 metro in the world? Do you?The example given doesn&#x27;t make any sense.You&#x27;re just giving an ideological example. Not one that occurs in the real world.Here is one that actually happens: Using cloudflare DNS to protect privacy is one that occurs in the real world and eg. Apple is using them for exactly that.But let&#x27;s repeat:> We are working with the small number of networks with a higher network&#x2F;ISP density than Cloudflare (e.g., Netflix, Facebook, Google&#x2F;YouTube) to come up with an EDNS IP Subnet alternative that gets them the information they need for geolocation targeting without risking user privacy and security. reply pseg134 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, so cloudflare is making sure no one else can compete. reply NicoJuicy 8 hours agorootparentDidn&#x27;t read the last alinea?> We are working with the small number of networks with a higher network&#x2F;ISP density than Cloudflare (e.g., Netflix, Facebook, Google&#x2F;YouTube) to come up with an EDNS IP Subnet alternative that gets them the information they need for geolocation targeting without risking user privacy and security.---I don&#x27;t know what happened between that statement and now. Since they were working together with eg. Google to solve it.Still. No example? So not an issue now? replyLinuxBender 21 hours agoparentprevDo you use something besides 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1?99% of the time I just talk directly to the root servers from my home network and pre-cache the most popular places I visit. Unbound also supports DoH but most distributions of Linux do not enable that compile time flag in their Unbound package build and I have long since stopped compiling things as most distributions finally started using the right security options in their builds. I also have DoT running at home which the cell phone figured out on it&#x27;s own.I keep DoT Unbound DNS running on several VPS providers that also talk directly to the root servers just in case. Useful for cell phones. My ISP is a tiny community ISP and would never filter any results and DNS privacy is just one tiny piece of browsing habits. Until encrypted SNI is fully adopted by all SSL libraries and applications they can still see where I browse unless I am using my own Tinc VPNs or SSH tunneling. reply lxgr 20 hours agorootparent> I just talk directly to the root servers from my home network and pre-cache the most popular places I visit.Out of curiosity: Why, if you generally trust your ISP? Do you get worse performance using their DNS servers? reply LinuxBender 20 hours agorootparentI prefer to use my own server as I can optimize cache hit ratios for the things I request. This makes the internet perceptibly faster for me and others on my network. I can also pull statistics from my server whereas I would have to beg someone at the ISP for that data as a one-off request. This also gives me the option to block domain names used for dark patterns or outright malevolent behavior. I also have control over the upper and lower limits of cache and I can flush to cache if a website is still relying upon DNS failover vs BGP Anycast but I have not run into that for about a decade.Speaking of stats, I can also see what IoT&#x2F;Cell devices are requesting to keep an eye on their behavior and look for interesting patterns of DNS requests.I have honestly never used the ISP DNS servers so I don&#x27;t know what their performance is like. It&#x27;s just muscle memory for me to set up my own home Linux router to be a DNS server. I highly doubt they could top the performance of Unbound and cron-jobs that request commonly used records on an hourly basis. I do know that my performance is better than talking to the DoH&#x2F;DoT servers on the internet. The cached record response time is in microseconds vs 23ms for CF and non cached response time is generally between 50ms and 70ms vs 80ms to 160ms for CF not-cached.Another nifty option in Unbound is to cache the \"Infrastructure\" records and to \"Keep Probing\" multiple nodes. This combines into a nice balance of speed and resilience especially if someones name server is having a moment but their status page is green. unbound-control dump_infra|wc -l 1235These numbers are thrown off a bit by my cron jobs that are requesting things that I am not visiting all the time and when the authoritative record is sub 3600 seconds. They are requested hourly. Some of the government domains in my cron job seem to be throwing off the curve, I will reach out to them. total.num.cachehits=20949 total.num.cachemiss=8010 total.num.prefetch=753 total.recursion.time.median=0.0698958 reply lxgr 19 hours agorootparentInteresting, thank you!Yeah, local caching is a good point if your operating system(s) doesn&#x27;t already do it in the DNS client.> This also gives me the option to block domain names used for dark patterns or outright malevolent behavior.I wonder how long this will actually remain possible, given that with DoH it now seems entirely feasible for websites to provide their own application-level DNS resolver? reply LinuxBender 19 hours agorootparentInteresting, thank you!You&#x27;re quite welcome!I wonder how long this will actually remain possible, given that with DoH it now seems entirely feasible for websites to provide their own application-level DNS resolver?For me, forever. Applications can not bypass my DNS unless they are hard coding IP addresses in the application. Windows Update does have some hard coded IP addresses it can fall back on.It is often said that DoH can&#x27;t be blocked because in theory it can be hosted on any generic CDN IP pool but to my knowledge this has never been the case. It&#x27;s quite the opposite, most DoH&#x2F;DoT providers try to use vanity IP addresses. I null route them and NXDOMAIN the canary domain use-application-dns.net which is entirely optional but a nice gesture to applications to behave. Some vendor may decide one day to host their own DoH&#x2F;DoT servers but I suspect I would learn about them. I would likely just avoid buying&#x2F;using that device&#x2F;application.Perhaps some day a DoH provider may be so bold as to use a generic CDN pool and I will have to address that issue when it arises. I suspect this would be more challenging for the provider as the app&#x2F;device will need a way to discover this pool DNS name, HTTP headers, API calls, etc... unless they hard code IP&#x27;s. Either way I could dynamically null route them. reply shagie 15 hours agorootparentTangentially related: My Chromecast Ultra would not start until I began answering 8.8.8.8 --- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19170671 (2019; 509 comments)The original post for that is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mailarchive.ietf.org&#x2F;arch&#x2F;msg&#x2F;dnsop&#x2F;WCVv57IizUSjNb2R... from Paul VixieAlso:An Internet Born In a Threat-Free Environment - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.recordedfuture.com&#x2F;podcast-episode-201 (2021)Paul Vixie and Peter Lowe on Why DoH is Politically Motivated - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dnsfilter.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;paul-vixie-and-peter-lowe-on-... (also from 2021) reply LinuxBender 14 hours agorootparentThat is a good write-up on Paul&#x27;s comments. I think he has an account here on HN. I recall discussing similar concerns here on HN when the protocol was first being discussed but I think most of my concerns were largely ignored. People were enamored by the idea of DoH but I see it as exacerbating a few problems.It does not really address the issue of privacy unless one is only making DNS requests and not doing anything with said DNS results, as encrypted SNI is still not widely adopted. I guess I would call that cart before the horse. It does not prevent an abusive ISP from blocking access to a site as they can just block all the DoH resolvers or just NXDOMAIN the canary domain which also turns it off by default on most browsers. The bigger issue to me is that it doubles the number of organizations that can track behavior. Now my ISP gets this data and so does Cloudflare if I am the type to leave things default as most people are and they know it. CF may not wish to block something but should they receive a court order from any country they do business in then most people will lose access to something. That could be a future phase we have not yet reached due to mass adoption not reaching a set goal at this time. This is also a one-stop-shop for law enforcement to gather browsing data vs. having to issue a court order to each ISP.Some people mention it protects against rogue nations but they are by far the last people that DoH would be useful for. Rogue &#x2F; bad &#x2F; totalitarian nations will just null route anything they suspect to be a DNS servers not in their control and will extract people from their homes to re-educate them. In a way I can see DoH as being a risk to people in such situations. Meaning they could be accused of bypassing some state level control and may not even realize they were.In my opinion DoH&#x2F;DoT should have been highly customizable in a GUI before it was ever implemented and default-off, default opt-out settings and instead if the browser or ideally the OS recognizes it is in a shared WiFi then maybe prompt the person to temporarily enable DoH. That&#x27;s another issue, it&#x27;s in the browser and not the OS. So the browser gets protection but nothing else does at least for the last few years. That is coming soon to some operating systems. Curious if they make it obvious what DNS partnership is in place. reply lxgr 19 hours agorootparentprev> Applications can not bypass my DNS unless they are hard coding IP addresses in the application.That&#x27;s what I mean: What if websites and applications just start querying IP addresses for the hostnames they want to connect to over DoH (to api.someapp.com, so you can&#x27;t distinguish it from a regular API call that you want to allow for the app to work), and then connect to the resolved IP directly? reply kxrm 11 hours agorootparentI reroute all DNS queries attempting to leave my network to my DNS server. It won&#x27;t work in scenarios where there is DoH without user consent, however at that point I should reconsider purchasing such hostile devices. reply LinuxBender 19 hours agorootparentprevThe heavy-handed solution looks like this: local-zone: \"api.someapp.com.\" always_nxdomainThen I reach out to them and say something to the effect of, \"Hey, nice application&#x2F;device you have there! In order for anyone on my network to utilize this app&#x2F;device the DNS would need to be put back into your DNS servers and removed from the API records.\" Of course they will laugh at me but that is fine given that 100% of the internet and internet connected devices are entirely optional for me. It is unlikely that a statistically significant number of people would use this heavy handed approach. Or perhaps I am OK with their API method and make use of their API that bypasses DNS. This probably depends on if this is malicious or not. i.e. serving ads or malwareAnother heavy-handed option would be to force all traffic through a MITM proxy which I have done in the past. Any device that can&#x27;t have my CA cert loaded would be a paperweight and thus returned to Amazon with less than 5 stars and a review that details the DNS implementation which most customers would not care about or understand but my fellow cranky network admins may find useful. If it&#x27;s a website then I would just not use it. Some businesses take this approach. There are both commercial and open source solutions for this. Look for Squid SSL-Bump MITM proxy if one is curious. This requires bypasses for domains still using public key pinning which is an insignificant number of them. Most have moved away from HPKP due to the induced fragility and risks.There are other methods but they come with security implications such as decompiling applications, shimming something into it or pre-loading libraries to do the same thing but this usually requires rooting a device and potentially compromising security as the vendor signing may be removed. I&#x27;m sure some of the mobile developers here have more elegant and secure methods.I doubt many would do any of this of course, but you asked. reply fsmv 19 hours agorootparentprevBut your home DNS server has to talk to some other server to get the IPs right? Usually it&#x27;s like DNSMasq configured to cache and forward requests to 8.8.8.8 or whatever.Is there some other option where you talk directly to the top level DNS root and the nameservers directly??Edit: my bad you said you talk to the root servers directly. Not sure how to delete comments reply LinuxBender 19 hours agorootparentEdit: my bad you said you talk to the root servers directly. Not sure how to delete commentsIt&#x27;s still a valid question. You are right, one has to bootstrap the root servers. There are a few ways to do this. Assuming one had working DNS server at some point in the past they can dig @e.root-servers.net +nocookie +tries=4 +retry=4 +time=8 . nsgrep -Ev \"^;|^$\" > &#x2F;etc&#x2F;unbound&#x2F;named_hints.tmp # sanity check thisand then do sanity checks on the output prior to loading it as hints in Unbound DNS. The 3K or so root servers are Anycast IP addresses and rarely change so this file will not be stagnant for a very long time thus making thumb drives a valid way to store and transfer this file. reply icedchai 8 hours agorootparentWhy not use the root.hints file available for this purpose? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iana.org&#x2F;domains&#x2F;root&#x2F;filesGenerally it is already included with most DNS servers, such as BIND. reply LinuxBender 7 hours agorootparentThat is useful for the initial bootstrapping but should be updated or at least validated a few times a year. If package maintainers are updating it a few times a year that works too. reply icedchai 7 hours agorootparentRoot DNS server IP&#x27;s do change. However, the old ones stay active for years.

They have binaries to add support for DoH to my router. I literally couldn’t be happier with a DNS provider. reply basch 16 hours agorootparentMy one gripe is with the block &#x2F; parental controls interface.Let’s say you want to block Peacock, and there’s a bunch of urls you want to block, each is it’s own individual rule. If you accidentally delete one instead of disable it, it’s gone. If you can remember the url you accidentally deleted, now it’s placed at the top of the list, out of order. There appears to be no log of changes you make. It would be nice to be able to add custom parental controls with sets&#x2F;bundles of urls.Also you can’t toggle or package ad blocking rules, only delete and add. Sort of the same interface complaint as above. I have to go in and delete four ad blocking packages every time I want to watch Paramount+.

Whether the DoH provider is sending the ECS to authoritative servers I do not know, but to me it is quite sad to see this being returned in the response given I did not request it. Anyway, ECS is supposedly the reason 1.1.1.1 does not include DNS data for archive.isThe site once used a tracking pixel as a poor mans ECS. The client IP address was inserted into the image name. Apparently the operator of the site explained this was used to achieve CDN-like functionality:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=275018671. Perhaps we should be clear that \"servers\" here means open resolvers. These servers are of course not authoritative for any name, and generally recursion is slower than iteration, i.e., use of authoritative servers only (fee free to challenge me on this and I will share a citation, although I know this is true from own experiments). Thus \"reliable\" is perhaps ambiguous. Not all of them always return the same results. Some will return different answers, and not always for \"load balancing\" reasons. Some may be missing data entirely. Some will return wrong answers, e.g., pretending to be authoritative. Much DNS funny business on the internet today. I gather results from a variety of resolvers, from authoritative servers as well as other sources of DNS data, e.g., public zone files, scans and crawls, and I compare notes; I personally would not feel comfortable using one open resolver (third party DNS) as the source for all DNS data; I could not rely on it. As such, \"reliable\" is IMHO a loaded term if used to describe open resolvers. reply Jnr 21 hours agoparentprevHow come archive.is works for me?I have set up Cloudflare DoH in my router, I block other popular DoH servers on my network and I also redirect any other DNS queries (UDP 53) to my router&#x27;s DNS (which in turn uses Cloudflare).And at least in my region (EU) I did not notice any issues with 1.1.1.1. reply yakubin 20 hours agorootparentMaybe your computer ignores the DNS resolver address suggested by your router?

I did try with dig. :) Also tried it from other countries in EU, works fine. reply fragmede 9 hours agoparentprevCloudflare is in the wrong here. Archive.is had to develop a unique CDN system to protect against illegal content being uploaded and immediately reported, which led to server seizures and downtime. Cloudflare&#x27;s DNS disrupts this system, putting archive.is at risk. Archive.is even offered to proxy Cloudflare DNS users via their CDN, but Cloudflare rejected the proposal. This leaves archive.is in a vulnerable position, and it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect them to register their own autonomous system just to fix this issue. reply lgeorget 21 hours agoparentprevI use OpenDNS. 208.67.222.222 doesn&#x27;t roll off the tongue (or fingers) as easily as 1.1.1.1 but if you use it frequently enough, you&#x27;ll remember it. reply anuraaga 10 hours agoparentprevI was using Cloudflare DNS for a while until learning it was the cause of archive brokenness, switched to Google DNS, and recently have started trying out Adguard DNS just out of curiosity of trying out DNS-over-QUIC (requires a VPN app that supports that).

Your devices also have their own cache. reply drexlspivey 7 hours agorootparentThe point is that if the TTL is 10mins and you lookup the domain after it expires the regular DNS will go and fetch it, unbound fetches it as soon as it expires and it is already cached reply RockRobotRock 3 hours agorootparentThank you, I&#x27;m sorry I wasn&#x27;t aware of the prefetch feature.
