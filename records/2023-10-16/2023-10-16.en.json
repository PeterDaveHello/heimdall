    "originBody": "Skip to main content Electronic Frontier Foundation About Issues Our Work Take Action Tools Donate SEARCH Mastercard Should Stop Selling Our Data BY HAYLEY TSUKAYAMA OCTOBER 10, 2023 We trust companies with our information every day. But many companies—even those that hold our most revealing information—are using it not just to provide the services we ask for, but to amp up their profits at the cost of our privacy. That's why EFF has joined a campaign, led by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (U.S. PIRG), to call on Mastercard to limit its data collection and stop selling cardholder information. Mastercard is just one company that profits from the sale of personal data collected from the people who trust them with their information. As consumer advocates, we’re calling on the company to honor the trust that cardholders place in them by committing to stop selling their information. Why make this ask of Mastercard? As U.S. PIRG explains in its report accompanying the campaign, the company’s position as a global payments technology company affords it \"access to enormous amounts of information derived from the financial lives of millions, and its monetization strategies tell a broader story of the data economy that’s gone too far.\" Knowing where you shop, just by itself, can reveal a lot about who you are. Mastercard takes this a step further, as U.S. PIRG reported, by analyzing the amount and frequency of transactions, plus the location, date, and time to create categories of cardholders and make inferences about what type of shopper you may be. In some cases, this means predicting who’s a “big spender” or which cardholders Mastercard thinks will be “high-value”—predictions used to target certain people and encourage them to spend more money. These kinds of actions work against the trust that many people have for the company that issues their cards. In fact, the Bank for International Settlements found that people trust traditional financial institutions with their data more than big tech companies, government bodies, or fintech firms. When people get a card from Mastercard, they do not anticipate the ways the financial profile of their purchases will be remixed, repackaged, and used against them. Mastercard can and should do better. We call on the company to respect the trust and privacy of its cardholders and change its current data practices. Discover more.

Was it always like that? Is there any hope?No, technology made it far easier. It&#x27;s now targeted and automated, it&#x27;s as worse as it has ever been and continues to get worse. There is not a politician in any land willing to do anything about it - more product sold at higher prices means larger taxes.

Nothing would ever be built without the help from ad-tech!\" reply gleenn 2 hours agoparentprevI think the answer is very simple: people don&#x27;t understand and even if they do then they don&#x27;t understand that what might seem minor \"well whatever, it&#x27;s just some nails this one time,\" and it doesn&#x27;t cross over to the huge power this data yields in aggregate. reply amelius 54 minutes agorootparentAlso, people like the discounts they get from their loyalty cards, and also the free stuff on the internet.What they don&#x27;t know is that they pay twice, once with their data and once with money.

One could always think that we hit a local minimum. But the comatose, practically non-existent debate suggests there are no reacting forces, the malaise runs deep.Its puzzling and confusing because none of that phemomena seem pre-ordained.

A thought terminating cliche.It honestly makes crypto look desirable, and buildings designed with sensor blocking materials. You can&#x27;t passively surveil a data-center. Why should my home, office or shopping mall be any different?The powers-that-be never gave us a choice to opt-out. It&#x27;s been a slow gradual decline.We have to incentivize haggling over our own data. My unseen&#x2F;unknown data is my asset and I will protect it&#x27;s financial value.We can&#x27;t trust random joes to not sell out crypto exchanges and the like, so you have to build technology that functions as a manual crypto exchange - without a developer on it&#x27;s back to pull the ripchord and destroy the technology whenever money shows up.Manual software is key, as soon as it becomes \"automated\", some developer has to be roped into hand-holding it through tech changes. Crypto software that only exists because a man put it together and went hands-off, is Key.Then you can build the normal philosophical&#x2F;structural&#x2F;relationship management ideas on top of that. reply hknmtt 3 hours agoprevActually all current card payment providers should be put out of business altogether. Two companies(master&#x2F;visa) hold complete control over the entire customer spending in the whole world.- They also prevented banks from catching up to the 21st century, technology-wise, and we still do not have instant online payments. There is so many things bad with banking and many causes can be traced back to these card payment providers. We need alternatives, as many as there are banks in the world. Every bank needs to be a card payment provider, an online payment gateway providers and so on. reply Lutger 55 minutes agoparentNot the whole world, this is mostly in the United States. In Europe its more like what you describe, banks are the card payment provider and we have (near) instant online transfers. Credit cards are relatively unimportant here. reply izacus 7 minutes agorootparentWhat are you going on about? Pretty much all European banks issue Visa&#x2F;Mastercard credit and debit cards (sometimes under their subbrands Maestro and VPay) by default to pretty much all customers.Most in-store payment processing goes directly over those two companies still. reply skywal_l 3 hours agoparentprevBanks are already processing payments. When you put your credit card in your bank&#x27;s ATM, the ATM is managed by the bank. It connects to your bank server and all the authorisation and processing is being done by the bank. Visa and mastercard provide connection to other banks. When you put your card in another bank&#x27;s ATM or buy something in a business associated with another bank.Getting ride of the Visa&#x2F;Mastercard duopoly would mean that all banks must connect to all other banks, which they do not want to do, believe me. That would be an administrative hell for them. Which is why they&#x27;ve been putting up with those two for so long. These are the google of banks. They are convenient.The alternative would be some sort of joint venture between all the banks. The result would less fees for the banks but no benefits for the client as the bank would keep the margin and it would still be a privacy hell.Another alternative is a public utility. But a lot of people will be as uncomfortable providing their payment data to the government. reply dantyti 3 minutes agorootparent> would mean that all banks must connect to all other banksI think the EU&#x27;s getting there with open banking directives like the PSD2:\"the provision of a standardised and reliable access interface to payment accounts (i.e. an application programming interface, API)\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecb.europa.eu&#x2F;paym&#x2F;intro&#x2F;mip-online&#x2F;2018&#x2F;html&#x2F;18... reply ankit219 1 hour agorootparentprev> The alternative would be some sort of joint venture between all the banks. The result would less fees for the banks but no benefits for the client as the bank would keep the margin and it would still be a privacy hell.This is what happens in India. UPI (unified payment interface) was launched by NPCI which is kind of a joint venture between the regulator and banks. In an abstract sense, the bank processing the payment does connect with every other bank via NPCI.The underlying rails are an older infrastructure of IMPS[1] which is the interbank money transfer system.I do not agree with the privacy hell part. When bank transfers happen, they anyway have to do the required checks with the other banks. Frankly, people in my circle never even cared if it could be a privacy issue for us.On another note, there was always incentive to launch NPCI in india because 1&#x2F; The infra is relatively newer so it was easier to do (java I think) 2&#x2F; Almost all banks&#x27; software was built by Infosys&#x2F;TCS etc. (in java) and that meant the ones integrating would be the same parties who practically used the same architecture 3&#x2F; Visa&#x2F;Mastercard did not have that kind of penetration in 2010 so settlements were a real issue faced by every bank.In US or European case, the issue seems bigger because the problem is half solved by Visa&#x2F;Mastercard, so there is a bit of inertia to solve the same problem again.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npci.org.in&#x2F;PDF&#x2F;npci&#x2F;upi&#x2F;Product-Booklet.pdf reply generic92034 1 hour agorootparentprev> Getting ride of the Visa&#x2F;Mastercard duopoly would mean that all banks must connect to all other banks, which they do not want to do, believe me.

But yes, the duopoly situation sucks. And of course, the privacy situation with credit card companies is not nearly as bad in Europe as it&#x27;s in the US.I think we need more regulation and government oversight here - even in Europe, but especially in The Land of the Free. reply hvaldimir 3 hours agoparentprevDo something about it then? reply lnxg33k1 3 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t writing about it on internet, making people aware of the issue, discussing, doing something about something?

See their privacy FAQ also:> Does Mastercard share transaction data?> We do not share transaction data without consent or as otherwise legally permitted such as in the context of fraud prevention.That&#x27;s a yes or no question. Instead of answering it with a resounding YES they instead reply with some waffle about \"legally permitted context\".They also miss out that they sell services that access that data. So an external party might not be able to see it directly but they can pay Mastercard to do the same customer monitoring for them. reply bertil 5 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know if it’s deliberately confusing, but it certainly was reviewed by several lawyers. reply nurettin 4 hours agorootparentprevIt is deliberately confusing, but ultimately the meaning behind seems to be \"this particular data collection is not for personal advertisements, we got that covered in some other way\". reply knappe 11 hours agoparentprevThere is also a bit of a &#x27;yes but &#x27; here> We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different level of quality of goods or services if you choose to exercise these rights, except where the different price or level of quality of good or service is reasonably related to the value of the data that we receive from you.

I was under the impression that Apple had taken measures to prevent exactly this kind of information from being leaked from Apple Card use.That is, beyond rotation of card numbers whenever Apple Pay is used.Knowing Apple has put an emphasis on customer privacy, and that Apple Card is run on Mastercard makes zero mention of it in either article kind of stand out to me.It would be great to get clarification on what the scope is of Apple Card customer exposure to Mastercard’s commercialization of payment data. reply addandsubtract 54 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not familiar with Apple Card, but aren&#x27;t all privacy measures only point-of-sale facing? As in, you pay with a random card number and the shop can&#x27;t track you, but Mastercard obviously still has a record on you. So unless Apple is a middleman able to issue Mastercards on their own behalf(?) for their customers, I don&#x27;t see how much more privacy they can offer. reply Spooky23 6 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s bullshit - it should be through the issuer.

I thought I&#x27;d buy a few $100 worth cards and use them for pseudo-anonymous transactions. However, all I could find were prepaid \"debit cards\" (which could be easily tied back to be) our store specific \"gift\" cards.Curious to see if anyone has a good solution for that? (In the US.) reply hansvm 5 hours agoparentVisa vanilla is fairly practical for most threat models. I know some orgs are trying to do more ad targeting via security cameras across multiple stores, but afaik you&#x27;ll have no problem paying cash for a visa vanilla gift card, activating it online (through a vpn or something if you&#x27;re worried about that level of tracking), and then using it like a credit card at nearly any brick-and-mortar store and many online retailers.Potential flaws:(1) They used to have a bit of overhead (1-5%). Not sure nowadays.(2) None of that is ironclad anonymity. Don&#x27;t be an outspoken gay ukrainian hacktivist journalist visiting russia or anything.(3) Some organizations will only do business with you if they&#x27;re able to slurp up more data than the initial transaction would suggest to a reasonable person. You can&#x27;t use prepaid phones to sign up to many online accounts (notably Facebook for a long time) because the site owner can&#x27;t slurp up your address and other info without certain postpaid plans, and you can&#x27;t use any pseudo-anonymous card [0] to make transactions at a place that wants to buy your address and purchasing habits from the card issuer.[0] Solutions like privacy.com might qualify here perhaps, in that you can actually anonymize your name&#x2F;address&#x2F;... and still use most of the sites trying to capitalize on that data, but fundamentally that just turns them into a middleman with the same data, and I expect they&#x27;ll sell out eventually. Plus they have raw access to your bank account and other things you might not want to give out. reply TheCapeGreek 3 hours agorootparent>You can&#x27;t use prepaid phones to sign up to many online accountsPresumably this is meaning prepaid phone numbers? Also assuming this is likely a US thing?

Merchants or payments services often get lower interchange rates for providing this extra data reply jxramos 7 hours agorootparentI always wondered about this. It feels like the information gets compressed or summarized a bit. I know this because when I previously had fraud charges I had to dispute the credit card company could report with some amount of accuracy the items that made up the transaction as well as in other transactions that they took the time to vet for fraud as well since they had me on the phone. It wasn’t brand or sku number granularity it was more categorical, clothing, maybe a sweater or something coarse like that.

In Europe this is only a marginal thing and most people just have debit cards. reply wolverine876 12 hours agorootparentThere are advantages to credit. For example, the money remains in your hands until you pay your credit card bill, so if there is a dispute, fraud, or overcharge, you don&#x27;t have to fight and wait to get your money back.Also, some businesses, such as car rental companies, won&#x27;t provide services to debit card holders.Also, it&#x27;s a free [edit: zero-interest, not free] loan (if you pay credit card bills in full); you get some small marginal revenue from the money you keep for up to a month. reply quicklime 11 hours agorootparentThere are some benefits, but it does complicate the transaction significantly. It&#x27;s no longer between two parties (a consumer and a merchant), there are now at least two more: a lender and a credit bureau.And that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re in this mess to begin with. Credit card transactions are reported to credit bureaus (from a quick web search, it looks like debit card transactions aren&#x27;t) and this normalizes the idea that your financial data should be shared freely amongst finance companies.There&#x27;s really no such thing as a free lunch, or a free loan. When someone offers you one, it&#x27;s good to understand how you&#x27;re going to be paying for it. reply wayfinder 3 hours agorootparentCredit reporting makes getting loans easier because lenders are more willing to give loans when they can look up your credit rating instead playing it safe and declining you because they have nothing to judge the risk with.You also get fraud protection.It’s not free, but you’re not necessarily paying for it. The main concern is that some people are definitely paying for it disproportionally more than others. reply etiennebausson 1 hour agorootparentI would disagree, as things stand, getting a loan is easier if you have a good credit rating, but it is a deformation of the space.If there was no credit reporting, the lender would still need to loan just as much.

Issuers have at least a choice out of these two; acquirers just have to accept whatever their customer puts on the counter at payment time (or lose ~50% of their card-paying customers).In other words, participation is (relatively) easy; getting some amount of control, let alone autonomy, is almost impossible – again due to the network effect. replytflinton 12 hours agorootparentprevThat takes an enormous amount of frozen capital.

Usually this is then used to determine whether a specific individual who viewed a advertisement (as determined by probabalistic (ip address, session id, or similar) or deterministic data (device id, account login) about an individual) has actually been \"converted\" to make a purchase. These data sets are not \"deidentified\" or \"anonymized\" as many of them claim, and \"data clean rooms\" advertised by many ad tech vendors are a good privacy aid, but are not nearly sufficient to protect vulnerable populations. reply worik 9 hours agorootparentprevYes.But perhaps go further?> It should just be illegal to use customer data unless they explicitly agree.Should you be able to use customers data for any purpose whatsoever except in the delivery of goods and services that define your business?There are edge cases, of course.

We live the reality I&#x27;m describing with Steam, which is millions of people, it&#x27;s been going on for a long time, it&#x27;s conceivable that even broader categories of transaction data may be prisoner-dilemma-style valuable to share.

Why pay 2% to accept a few more cards from foreigners and tourists when 99% of your customers already have a 0.3% fee card (Maestro or VPay)?Also, the Dutch iDEAL system might form in important building block of a European home-grown payment solution, that hopefully will give the Visa&#x2F;MC duopoly some actual competition: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_Payments_Initiative reply BrandonS113 23 minutes agorootparentI agree.

Plus it doesn’t matter which bank you go to, just pick the nearest name brand big bank ATM and you’re good to go. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Kyseinen asetus toteutuessaan nykymuodossa käytännössä kieltäisi vahvan, päästä päähän ulottuvan salauksen koko Euroopassa, kaikissa viestinnän muodoissa. Tavalliselle kuluttajalle kenties tunnetuin esimerkki vahvasta salauksesta ovat pikaviestimet, kuten WhatsApp ja Signal. Vahvasti salatut pikaviestimet ovat mahdottomia murtaa ja viestejä voi lukea vain viestin lähettäjä sekä sen tarkoitettu vastaanottaja. EU haluaa, että Euroopan viranomaiset pääsisivät murtamaan tämän välin siten, että kaikkea viestintää voitaisiin seurata tekoälyn avulla ja etsiä sieltä epäilyttävää materiaalia, ilman erillistä oikeuden määräystä. Eli salaus pitäisi murtaa - ja rakentaa kaikkea viestintää seuraava massavalvonta. Suomen kanta Suomessa asiaan otettiin kantaa perjantaina, kun eduskunnan Suuri valiokunta antoi asiasta päätöksensä. Suuren valiokunnan päätös pohjautuu useilta eri tahoilta kerättyihin asiantuntijalausuntoihin, mukana mm. IT-alan edustajat, perustuslakivaliokunta, jne. MAINOS Lue lisää Suuren valiokunnan kanta sitoo Suomen hallitusta, kun hallitus alkaa neuvottelemaan asetuksesta EU:ssa, eli hallituksen on pakko noudattaa valiokunnan ohjeistusta. Suuren valiokunnan päätös saatiin perjantaina iltapäivällä ja sen voisi tiivistää termiin \"varovainen ei\". Valiokunta kehui CSAM-esityksen taustalla olevaa ideaa, eli lasten suojelua verkon vaaroilta: Suuri valiokunta katsoo, että asetusehdotuksella on erittäin painava tavoite tehokkaasti ennaltaehkäistä ja torjua lapsiin kohdistuvaa verkkovälitteistä seksuaaliväkivaltaa EU-tason toimin. Valiokunta pitää tärkeänä, että EU-tasolla syntyy selkeä ja sitova oikeudellinen kehys, jolla voidaan tehostaa hyväksikäytön havaitsemista, ilmoittamista ja poistamista. Valtioneuvoston tavoin suuri valiokunta painottaa lapsen edun merkitystä, kun punnitaan ehdotuksen eri osien suhdetta perustuslakiin ja perus- ja ihmisoikeuksiin. Mutta siihen sitten asetuksen kanssa myötäily pitkälti loppuukin, sillä valiokunta nosti esiin CSAM-esityksen lukuisia ongelmakohtia. Ensinnäkin valiokunta on sitä mieltä, että päästä päähän salausta ei saa murtaa, sillä se murentaisi tietoturvaa: Suuri valiokunta katsoo liikenne- ja viestintävaliokunnan tavoin, että jatkoneuvotteluissa on erityisen tärkeä varmistaa, etteivät tunnistamismääräykset johda päästä päähän -salauksen tai muiden vastaavien tietoturvatoimenpiteiden yleiseen heikentämiseen, purkamiseen tai käytön rajoittamiseen ja tätä kautta viestinnän sekä viestinnän palvelujen tietoturvan ja kyberturvallisuuden tason heikkenemiseen. Lisäksi valiokunta katsoo, että ehdotusta ei voida kannattaa sellaisessa muodossa, että se sallisi massavalvonnan. Valiokunnan mukaan valvontaa pitäisi tehdä ainoastaan tunnistettuihin kohteisiin, eikä siis koko kansan tasolla. Eli valiokunta tyrmäsi ehdotuksen siitä, että kaikkien ihmisten kaikkia viestejä aletaan skannaamaan, josko sieltä löytyisi jotain epäilyttävää. Eli Suomi ei voi suuren valiokunnan lausunnon pohjalta hyväksyä ehdotusta tällaisenaan. Miten asia etenee? EU-maat äänestävät ehdotuksesta lokakuun lopulla. Tuolloin ehdotus menee läpi, mikäli sitä ei vastusta sellainen määrä maita, jotka edustavat yhteensä vähintään 35 prosenttia EU-kansalaisista. Tiedossa on, että ainakin Saksa, Itävalta ja Viro vastustavat ehdotusta. Kannattajia on tiedossa selkeästi enemmän, mm. Espanja, Tanska, Unkari ja Irlanti kannattavat komission ehdotusta. Päätöstä eivät ole vielä tehneet läheskään kaikki maat, sillä päätöstä odotetaan mm. Ranskan, Ruotsin, Belgian, Hollannin ja Portugalin osalta.

If being smart was a powerful differentiator, then there would be an opportunity for smart people to enter politics. They would excel because they would have a competitive advantage over the less intelligent people who are currently in politics. They would have the smarts to avoid pitfalls, and profit from their powerful status and accomplishments.But apparently they don&#x27;t do this because every single person who is smart enough, has a better opportunity elsewhere.

Voting power is proportional to EU citizenship and to pass it needs a supermajority. It&#x27;s not just Finland which opposes this either (they have a small population - 5.6M citizens). Larger countries like Germany (83M citizens) also oppose it but I also don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve quite so clearly stated they will vote against.Austria (9.1M) and Estonia (1.4M) are also mentioned and if they all vote \"No\", that is a bit over 99M people which is only 22% of EU citizens. So not enough to prevent it passing. No idea where the rest of the EU bloc sits on Yes&#x2F;No, I&#x27;m hoping it does *not* pass.Quoting from the translation where they explain how it works:\"EU countries will vote on the proposal at the end of October.

If the proposed law needs unanimous agreement of the Council, it makes sense to talk of Finland&#x27;s vote in that context. Even if only a simple majority is needed, it would be at least a sign that there is resistance in the Council. reply mrmanner 15 hours agoparentprevThe council, where all member states are represented, will vote on this.It&#x27;s basically like the senate in the US, except the states are represented by ministers instead of elected senators. reply ajb 14 hours agorootparentExactly.It&#x27;s also worth noting that the US Senate was originally not elected either. The transition to an elected Senate was triggered by two states individually deciding to elect their Senator, then the rest followed. The same could happen in the EU, which would make it much more democratic. And it would only take one country to make the first move. reply mrmanner 14 hours agorootparentInteresting about the US senate! I&#x27;m not sure that an EU member state can unilaterally make a similar decision though. The treaty is pretty clear that the council is made up by government ministers:> Citizens are directly represented at Union level in the European Parliament.> Member States are represented in the European Council by their Heads of State or Government and in the Council by their governments, themselves democratically accountable either to their national Parliaments, or to their citizens. reply ajb 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s true that the wording runs like that. But here&#x27;s the angle: the Council is the body intended to represent the member states, so the member states are the ones who get to decide who is going to represent them in council. At the moment, that&#x27;s usually the minister for the subject under discussion. It&#x27;s true that on those occasions where it is the head of state, you probably can&#x27;t get round sending your head of state (and probably wouldn&#x27;t want to). But if a member state decides they are going to define their own rules such that it&#x27;s an elected representative that gets sent the rest of the time, the rest of the EU shouldn&#x27;t be able to overrule it, because that would defeat the purpose of the role being one that is under control of a member state. reply nsajko 14 hours agorootparentprevIt seems you don&#x27;t know the EU has a parliament: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_Parliament> Since 1979, the Parliament has been directly elected every five years by the citizens of the European Union through universal suffrage. reply ajb 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know why you would bother to reply if you are going to assume that level of ignorance.Yes,the parliament exists. I have voted for members of it. It is the most democratic part of the EU. The rules give it much more influence than hereto. But it has problems.1) The Council, which is not so democratic, can veto it2) The parliament is huge, so each member has very limited influence3) Because of 2) it has not succeeded in creating an EU &#x27;public sphere&#x27; or &#x27;demos&#x27;. The &#x27;parties&#x27; are just agglomerations of national parties. When you think of EU politicians, who are the big names? They are a) national figures and , b) Commissioners. Rarely do parliamentarians become well known,and usually for some other reason (Eg Nigel Farage).I stand by my statement that the EU would be much more democratic if the council were elected. Firstly, do you really think the US was not more democratic when the Senate became elected? Secondly, it would mean that there were &#x27;big figures&#x27; that get elected at an EU level. That would get the pubic much more interested and that is a significant part of what it means to be democratic. It doesn&#x27;t matter how democratic the rules are of nobody cares. reply ajb 13 hours agorootparent(can&#x27;t reply directly to mrmanner, so adding this here)Formally, yes, the Council represents democratically elected governments, and obviously people have heard of their national politicians. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it makes the EU democratic. Some things to think about:- When was the last time, if ever, you considered voting against someone at your national level because of how they might vote in the EU council?- How much do you hear about EU council votes in the media, vs national parliamentary votes? (the OP is relatively unusual IMO)The Commission is definitely undemocratic. But it has less power than many believe. It has the right to make proposals, but no power over whether they get adopted. It&#x27;s more of a civil service in many ways. In my view, the council is the structure that has the most power in the EU. And the national politicians who operate it are content that it remains avenue for back-room deals whose results they can blame on the Commission, rather than being accountable to an electorate. reply mrmanner 14 hours agorootparentprevThe council is made up by national governments, directly or indirectly elected in elections which typically have far higher participation and better media coverage than the EU parliament elections. I like the EU and I agree that the parliament is important, but I’m not so sure the council is “not so democratic”. Everyone knows the name of their government ministers, many know the names of their national parliamentarians.The commission is where we have the major lack of democracy currently. Not sure how to improve without a massive transfer of power to the Union (e.g. an elected president), but it’s a problem worth solving. reply jruohonen 14 hours agorootparentprevSeconded. reply lttlrck 14 hours agorootparentprevHow did you infer that?

    "originBody": "Lotus 1-2-3 For Linux Tavis Ormandy Intro Background Progress Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX A Mystery File Hacking GNU objcopy Porting Problems System Calls Relocations Incompatible Functions Termios Licensing Result Intro It’s an exciting time in the Lotus 1-2-3 enthusiast community – that was a joke, there is no enthusiast community, it’s just me! 😆 It really is an exciting time though – that part isn’t a joke! There have been some major developments in the last few weeks, and I guess that’s pretty unusual for 30 year old abandonware. I’ll cut to the chase; through a combination of unlikely discoveries, crazy hacks and the 90s BBS warez scene I’ve been able to port Lotus 1-2-3 natively to Linux – an operating system that literally didn’t exist when 1-2-3 was released!1 If you want to hear how a proprietary application could be ported to new operating systems 30 years after release, read on. Background I really like Lotus 1-2-3, I even maintain a driver to make sure it works well on modern systems. I had to reverse engineer the driver api to make that happen, but it works beautifully. Getting that driver working was quite an adventure, but there is still one piece of the puzzle missing: add-ins. 1-2-3 was designed to be extensible with plugins (or “add-ins”) – in theory you could add support for modern spreadsheet functions or integrate with Google Finance or something! The problem is add-ins had to be written in a special language called LPL, and unfortunately the compiler and SDK have been lost. This is not really surprising, this was a niche product and Lotus didn’t just give the SDK away – they charged $395 for it. I can’t imagine many people have a copy just lying around. There were lots of commercial plugins available in the heyday, some were really impressive. I emailed a few developers who worked on some to see if they had any old backups, the answer was always the same – 1-2-3 was the biggest name in software, nobody thought it was going anywhere, so why would they keep backups? There were also two third-party books written about LPL, I managed to track them down from old libraries. I like the cover on this one, very serious business. It’s so frustating, I can see screenshots of the debugger, compiler output and sample add-ins - but just can’t do anything with it without the SDK! Progress Fast forward a year or two, and I found someone who used to be a sysop in the ’90s BBS scene. Check out his website, he still has a catalogue of NFOs and a telnet BBS online if you want to see some rad ANSI art! He had kept tape backups from old BBS systems, and was able to recover a warez copy of the SDK – unbelievable! It actually worked, I was able to build a few sample plugins! You can download the ADK right here, and here is a sample LPL program. This would already have been enough to keep me entertained for a while, but it doesn’t stop there. It turns out that the BBS also had a warez copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX. This was widely thought to be lost – I’m told it couldn’t compete with a more popular UNIX office suite called SCO Professional, so there were not many copies sold. I didn’t really have any use for it, but I’m definitely curious enough to poke around on the installation media to see what’s in it! Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX The warez release was a bunch of TD0 files, that’s a format I’ve never seen before – apparently it’s an old compressed disk image format from the 80s.

I think this is smart, why waste precious bytes on a filesystem? $ tar xf 123UNIX1.RAW $ for i in 123UNIX{2..5}.RAW; do cpio -id123.o $ file 123.o 123.o: Intel 80386 COFF object file, not stripped, 5 sections, symbol offset=0x1efbdc, 19755 symbols, optional header size 28 Yikes - it’s an original unstripped object file from 1-2-3. There are nearly 20,000 symbols including private symbols and debug information. Why would Lotus ship this? It’s so big it must have required them to phyiscally ship an extra disk to every customer? Could it have been a mistake, accidentally left on the final release image? I had so many questions, but I’m not old enough to have any experience with SysV, so I asked the greybeards on alt.folklore.computers if they had seen this before and why this might have happened. The answer was that this is probably deliberate - dlopen() was not widely available on UNIX in the early 90s, so there was no easy way to load native plugins or extensions. To solve this, vendors would ship a bunch of partially linked object files with a script to relink them with your extensions – Clever! Hacking I can’t tell you how useful this discovery was – the debug information answered so many questions I had about Lotus 1-2-3 internals! This was a direct source port from DOS, so it mostly worked the same way but now I had debugging data. For example, I really wanted to hook into the rasterizer in my driver so that I could improve the appearance of graphs in the terminal… but it was just too complex to understand without documentation. I now know that the rasterizer dynamically generates little bytecode programs that that are interpreted by the graphics engine. Now that I know what the opcodes are I can disassemble and change them in my driver to improve the output! GNU objcopy Okay… but there is one more big question, I know that objcopy can convert COFF object files to ELF, the format used by Linux. It seems like a long shot, but is it possible I could link this into a native Linux program? 🐧 $ objcopy -I coff-i386 -O elf32-i386 123.o 123elf.o $ file 123elf.o 123elf.o: ELF 32-bit LSB relocatable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped Hilariously, the first version of Linux hadn’t even been released when this object file was compiled – but I think this is possible! If you want to hear about the technical challenges, read on! $ objdump -p 123.ogrep Date Time/Date Sat Sep 8 06:23:50 1990 Porting Problems System Calls The first problem is that Linux and UNIX do not use a compatible system call interface. UNIX uses the lcall7 interface, so we need to find those calls and fix them up. Here is how this object file calls open(): $ objdump -M intel --disassemble=open 123elf.o 123elf.o: file format elf32-i386 Disassembly of section .text: 000e20d4 : e20d4: b8 05 00 00 00 mov eax,0x5 e20d9: 9a 00 00 00 00 07 00 call 0x7:0x0 e20e0: 0f 82 c6 01 00 00 jb e22ace20e6: c3 ret e20e7: 90 nop That call instruction is what’s known as a callgate, which isn’t supported on Linux2, it will just crash. I want to remove this and route all calls through glibc instead. My first thought was just to mark these symbols as undefined, and then let the linker fix that up by importing a replacement symbol from glibc. Relocations Nothing is ever easy, it turns out that won’t work! If we try, objcopy will simply refuse: $ objcopy -I coff-i386 -O elf32-i386 --strip-symbol open 123.o 123elf.o objcopy: not stripping symbol `open' because it is named in a relocation What is objcopy trying to tell us here? This is a relocatable object file, which simply means it can be loaded at any address and still work. That’s possible because it contains all the necessary information – the relocations – to adjust it. Relocations are really simple, the compiler just records the name of the symbol and the references to it. Now the linker can just walk through and patch each reference to point to the new location – easy. So objcopy is saying that you can’t remove this symbol, because the linker won’t know what to patch in when it moves it. Fair enough – but, just because objcopy won’t do it doesn’t mean it’s impossible! We could just fix the relocations too, right? I don’t know of any tool that can do that, but COFF is not a complicated format – I’ll write one! Introducing coffsyrup, a tiny little tool that will remove those pesky COFF symbols even if objcopy refuses! $ coffsyrup 123.o 123new.o open MATCH open RELOC rel open @0x180fa ~0xc9ede RELOC rel open @0x4c9a1 ~0x95637 RELOC rel open @0x4d348 ~0x94c90 RELOC rel open @0x4ec13 ~0x933c5 Incompatible Functions Now that we can reroute functions, we have to worry about incompatible functions. Lots of standard UNIX functions are source but not binary compatible, this is because nobody promises that structures are the same size or layout across UNIX versions. The obvious example is struct stat. For example, this code is likely to work on any UNIX-like system you can compile it on: struct stat sb; if (stat(\"/etc/passwd\", &sb) == 0) { printf(\"Size: %u\\n\", sb.st_size); } However, the resulting object file is not likely to work on any other system. That’s because the size of struct stat and the offset of st_size will be different – it will probably just corrupt your stack and crash! Luckily there are not really that many functions like this in UNIX. In fact, the number is small enough that I can probably write wrappers to translate them. The important ones are stat(), times(), uname(), fcntl(), ioctl() and so on. All I have to do is rename those symbols with objcopy, then mark them undefined with coffsyrup. Now I can write a little wrapper that translates a Linux struct stat to a UNIX struct stat and it should work! Termios Well…I said “little” wrappers – but there are some big incompatabilities in places. One big nightmare was termios. Go ahead and take a look at the termios(3) man page, pretty complex right? Well, everything here works differently in subtle, incompatible, and difficult to debug ways on every UNIX system. Licensing Incredibly, after a bunch of hacking it actually runs without crashing! …and refuses to work without a license, damn! Well, I am a legitimate licensed 1-2-3 owner with a boxed copy of 1-2-3, and this is 32 year old abandonware. I think Mitch Kapor will forgive me for bypassing this check. I can see from breaking on exit() that there is an internal symbol called lic_init() responsible for checking for a valid license. I looked at the code in IDA, and figured out the logic. It is simply looking for a file called LICENSE.000, which contains an expiry date, username and systemname. If that all matches what the system reports, the check passes! 🏴☠ Result That’s it, Lotus 1-2-3 has been ported to a new operating system. There are a few kinks that need to be ironed out, and I need to port over my terminal driver, but it is 100% usable. At the moment, the DOS version running under emulation looks better - but this can be fixed! I hope you enjoyed reading about this, in the highly unlikely event you actually want to try it yourself – all of my code is on github. I’m specifically talking about the classic R3, there were releases until 2002.↩ Linux did have lcall7 and lcall27 compatability support at one point, but alas no more.↩ HOME • ABOUT • CONTACT",

Musk has a very specific way of running companies reflected in both SpaceX and Tesla. That involves two key things Apple would never do:- ship 90% solutions to learn very early what doesn’t work - iterate and make changes very rapidly to the productThis can be seen in the model 3, which has had significant variations even within a year. Both improvements (better fit and finish) and likely mistakes (deleting lidar).The same is seen on the SpaceX side. The starship launches were wildly successful despite the catastrophic endings. This can be seen in the live streams of the employees cheering wildly at the end (which completely baffled armchair critics).I’m on the fence if this is a good way to run companies long term, but the general point is that it’s about as far from Apple’s culture as you can get. reply avar 10 hours agorootparentThat Apple doesn&#x27;t ship 90% solutions is laughable. The initial versions of OSX, iPhone etc. had a lot of rough edges, and were practically public betas.The only difference is that Jobs and later his deciples were able to blow smoke up your ass, and sell the obvious incomplete product as focusing on some other distraction, or something. Clearly the reality distortion field worked. reply kortilla 6 hours agorootparentHardware vs software.

Within 5 seconds of clicking the button, I was connected to a live human, with both my video and sound, as well as the other person&#x27;s, turned on (although I did have the ability to switch them off). There was no intermediate step to filter out spam calls.

Wonder how soon this will become automated though? Since ASL seems like an image recognition task, and AI models are getting pretty good at that. reply adzm 11 hours agorootparent> ASL seems like an image recognition taskNot trying to be trite, but I imagine you don&#x27;t know ASL. It is an extremely loose and context dependent language really. I am sure it can be done eventually, but I still think it&#x27;s very far off in terms of recognition. Would love to find out more about the state of the art for ASL or BSL recognition though. reply maximusdrex 13 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not really, ASL is it’s own distinct language from English, like most sign languages. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language, which still isn’t anything related to French and has its own linguistic features and independent development. Because of this translating ASL to English (or any other language) is no easier than translating to or from any other spoken language. reply techsupporter 12 hours agorootparentAnd to add on a little, ASL is like any other language in that it has regional dialects. It&#x27;s why many people introduce themselves with their name and where they learned to sign.One of the more common examples from teachers is the sign for SLOW. On the west coast, we sign it as the flat palm being pulled slowly back along the extended non-dominant arm. But in the south and parts of the east, it is signed as the Y sign, thumb against the cheek, being tilted forward.The way you fix this casually is to ask the other person to finger spell or mime what they meant. I can&#x27;t see AI being able to do that well for a while but maybe..? reply yjftsjthsd-h 13 hours agorootparentprevSure, but machines are actually pretty good at spoken and written translation these days, so I would expect that once the image recognition is solved they could handle ASL readily as well. reply maximusdrex 13 hours agorootparentOh absolutely, I agree. I just wanted to make certain it was clear that it isn’t as simple as classifying images as words. reply eaglefield 10 hours agorootparentprevSince ASL doesn&#x27;t have a massive corpus of scrabeable training data (at least I would think). It&#x27;s probably on the harder side when it comes to creating machine translators. reply avar 9 hours agorootparentThere must be a huge corpus of TV broadcasts, filmed live events etc. where a person speaking is being translated into sign language in real time. reply userbinator 8 hours agorootparentThose are usually subtitled. reply serf 7 hours agorootparentin theory with a mastery of speech recognization one would assume you could then apply that to any diction that has an accompanying ASL translator to derive ASL elements from the contexts given by the spoken word.in practice that&#x27;s all difficult, if at all possible -- but just sayin; we have decently good speech interpretation at this point, perhaps we aren&#x27;t far from self-training ASL against something similar. reply TRiG_Ireland 8 hours agorootparentprevI suspect that buoys and placement make signed languages harder for machine translation than spoken ones. reply whywhywhywhy 12 hours agorootparentprevNever, the whole point is to employ ASL fluent people to keep the culture and language alive. reply userbinator 8 hours agorootparentprevYou mean a video recognition task. reply seydor 14 hours agoparentprevI thought it was AI reply patricklorio 15 hours agoprevSounds like a smart way to build a high quality dataset of captioned ASL videos while also providing a great service. Guessing in 2 years they’ll have a decent ML model. reply joshstrange 15 hours agoparentI’m not saying they won’t do that but Apple has been committed to accessibility in a way that no other company comes close to for decades. It’s in their core DNA and something their CEOs have said they will do even though the return on investment doesn’t really exist. Though I think overtime, it will.I wish “accessibility” wasn’t such a dirty word for most people (thinking it’s only for “disabled” people, or people with a problem). Accessibility is for everyone and I encourage people to dig into that section of their phone settings. Most people will be surprised at what is there and that there are probably 1-2 things at a minimum that they might be interested in turning on for themselves. reply extraduder_ire 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen more people using iPhone accessibility features without \"needing\" them than I have with people they&#x27;re supposedly designed for. Having the rear light flash for notifications was a huge one a couple of years back, which I mostly saw out in nightclubs. (perfect application, if a bit annoying to get flashed in the face a few times a night.)People using that floating assistivetouch button when they have a damaged screen&#x2F;home button was huge too.I think most non-technical people either don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re there or view them as hidden extra features.

A lot of the \"cool\" advanced settings on iOS are hidden inside accessibility settings. reply criley2 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m surprised to hear that \"Apple has committed to accessibility in a way that no other company comes close to for decades\" because Microsoft has already been doing that for over a decade, and is by far the most used OS for accessibility reasons.Apple is actually pretty behind in accessibility on desktop from what I&#x27;ve seen. Their apple designed peripherals (kbb&#x2F;mouse&#x2F;etc) are extremely anti-accessible and seem to be designed for the youngest and coolest crowd with zero thought for anyone with any disability. Unlike Microsoft, they do not sell any accessibility or disability focused peripherals. And their OS doesn&#x27;t make accessibility a first class experience.Third party support for hardware and software is massive for accessibility, and OSX is notoriously bad for third party support. Major third party peripherals from the biggest companies often have pretty bad support, and so the accessibility minority gets the short end of a short stick on OSX. reply GeekyBear 14 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m surprised to hear that \"Apple has committed to accessibility in a way that no other company comes close toBlind users who want to use Windows most often end up needing to pay over a thousand dollars for a JAWS license, since the built in accessibility software isn&#x27;t very good.

Literally out of the box Apple products for at least the last decade have specific features such as a basic sound channel balance (missing from Xbox, unsure about Windows) and best in class hearing aid support (a third party peripheral). Reliability and ease is important for these features and I don’t think buying add ons from Microsoft is remotely in the ballpark. reply sentientslug 14 hours agorootparentpreviPhones are essentially the only smartphones with enough accessibility features to be used by the blind, I suggest you watch a video on it because it’s quite fascinating. What do you find anti accessible about the apple peripherals? I’ve also had some experience using VoiceOver and found it acceptable. reply akira2501 15 hours agoparentprevASL does not have a 1:1 correspondence with spoken language and it uses a large amount of \"short hand\" and \"place holders\" for various situations. Throw in fingerspelling, which many signers can do at a very fast rate, and I strongly doubt the ability of a fixed location camera to accurately read an ASL conversation at any useful level. reply RockRobotRock 9 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s such an HN answer.

Why wouldn&#x27;t text chat be more appropriate in this situation? I understand that ASL could be much more quick&#x2F;fluent in a person to person interaction, plus it doesn&#x27;t need any technical means of writing, whether pen and paper or a computer. But isn&#x27;t technical support a rare use case where typing speed is not a big bottleneck and where also writing things out can help precision and cut down on having to repeat yourself? Given that resources are always limited, wouldn&#x27;t it be better to invest in accessibility where that has the most impact rather than a corner case where other workarounds are available? reply erik_seaberg 3 hours agoparentASL doesn&#x27;t seem to have a written form in common use. That user might read English, but only as a second language. reply zamalek 17 hours agoprevI was hoping to see something along the lines of ASL recognition. I strongly suspect that (an extension of) ASL could be an excellent way to interact with VR UIs. ASL natively exploits spatial context, which is what initially piqued my interest.

It&#x27;s also a hedge against my future potential hearing loss from tinnitus.Automatic interpreting wouldn&#x27;t solve any of those and neither it nor automated captions take the place of human-understood interpreting. I think putting ASL in something like VR where it is more visible to the hearing world might broaden its reach? reply aldebran 16 hours agorootparentprevI’m confused.

Why would anyone want that? reply 0ct4via 16 hours agoparentprevBecause (a) video chat doesn&#x27;t work brilliantly with sign language (signing can be rather quick, so any latency or artefacts could results in words or expressions being missed, and (b) not every Apple CSA knows how to sign ASL -- most don&#x27;t.Most places don&#x27;t have ASL interpreters on-call or even to any degree among their staff, and often rely on external companies to provide (often pre-booked) ASL interpreter sessions to D&#x2F;deaf clients.It&#x27;s really nice that Apple is making this available so easily and accessibly, and in-house.

    "commentBody": "SSH-audit: SSH server and client security auditingHacker NewspastloginSSH-audit: SSH server and client security auditing (github.com/jtesta) 250 points by thunderbong 15 hours ago| hidepastfavorite38 comments j1elo 9 hours agoFollowing the Hardening Guide link [1] I see that most server configs consist of the same 3 steps:* Re-generate (and enable) the RSA and ED25519 keys* Remove small Diffie-Hellman moduli* Restrict supported key exchange, cipher, and MAC algorithmsAs an ignorant of security matters, my obvious question is: if these are such an important thing to configure, why servers don&#x27;t come with them done by default? There must be thousands of people who don&#x27;t know about this guide, don&#x27;t necessarily know a lot about security hardening, and would benefit from more secure defaults.I get \"because compatibility\" might be a reason, but that would only maybe apply to the last point, wouldn&#x27;t it?[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ssh-audit.com&#x2F;hardening_guides.html reply efitz 8 hours agoparentMany (most?) releases auto generate the SSH server keys and set default configuration during OS or during SSH server enablement. Changing the server key protects you against the case that whoever made the distribution did it wrong - either used duplicate keys to other hosts, or intentionally compromised the key, or used a poor PRNG, or used a less desirable algorithm, perhaps for compatibility purposes.That is not to say that any of those things actually happened; it’s just that the most paranoid&#x2F;defense-oriented view is not to trust what the OS did for you, but to do it yourself.A distro provider is incentivized to find a local optimum between security and compatibility and has no idea about your environment.You have much more context about your environment- you know what you need to connect to, what needs to connect to you, and what ciphers, key length, and other configuration that you must support. Therefore if you take all that into account you might be able to optimize for security by disabling compatibility options you don’t need.BTW this answer is pretty much the same when it comes to hardening any security feature of any OS. Vendors&#x2F;distributors do a good job of hardening but you might be able to lock things down just a little further. reply rlpb 8 hours agorootparent> You have much more context about your environment- you know what you need to connect to, what needs to connect to you, and what ciphers, key length, and other configuration that you must support. Therefore if you take all that into account you might be able to optimize for security by disabling compatibility options you don’t need.As long as that&#x27;s what you actually do. If instead you want a checklist to blindly execute to \"harden\" your system, then the grandparent commenter is correct: either your can accept that your distribution&#x27;s defaults are actually good enough, or you&#x27;re removing functionality such that you&#x27;ll find a hurdle you&#x27;ve left for yourself sooner or later. reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentprevIf your OS distributor screwed you that badly (and a short check should be sufficient to determine if they did if the distribution is popular!) you’re deeply screwed anyway. And there is nothing post-facto you can do from within that distribution. reply napkin 7 hours agorootparentFor two years there was an undiscovered Debian-specific vulnerability in their OpenSSL package borking the generation of keys. But your point about being screwed from within applies to this case- regenerating the keys on an affected system would not have solved the problem, until it was patched. For those curious, look up ssh-vulnkey. reply tptacek 7 hours agoparentprevThese things (the ones you listed) aren&#x27;t in fact that important to configure. What matters is that you disable password login. The rest of it is pretty performative. Small modulus finite field Diffie Hellman isn&#x27;t how your server is going to get compromised. The server is going to accept the first algorithm the client proposes that&#x27;s also supported by the server, which isn&#x27;t going to be FFDH at all. reply hannob 4 hours agoparentprevThe reasons this site recommends disabling certain algorithms are, to say the least, very specualtive.Just to give two examples: It recommends disabling diffie hellman with 2048 bit. There isn&#x27;t even the slightest evidence that any attack might be possible on that size. It&#x27;s just based on some policy recommendations that convert DH size to key strength and it ends up being below 128 bit.It recommends disabling HMAC-SHA1. Now, SHA1 is not collission resistant. But HMAC is not affected by this weakness. Therefore there&#x27;s no real risk.Generally, OpenSSH has already improved algorithm security quite a lot over the years and everything that is remotely close to a real attack is disabled by default. reply ahoka 3 hours agorootparentI think the logic (there’s a link to an opinionated article they base their recommendations on) is the same as with TLS1.3, why wait until something gets broken? It selects a few safe choices and disables everything else. You don’t usually need to support more than two different algos, as you usually control both the server and the client. reply Helmut10001 3 hours agorootparentprevIs there a negative effect of applying these recommendations?On another note, this helped me solve a an issue [1], where I could not disable some weak HMAC algorithms.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unix.stackexchange.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;758814&#x2F;380381 reply ahoka 3 hours agorootparentSlower (as in less bandwidth and larger latencies) connection, using more CPU. Not sure if that makes any difference if you don’t use it for a tunnel or open a tons of connection for some reason. reply wolletd 14 hours agoprevNeat. Adding three lines to my sshd_config makes lines go green.Unfortunately, Dropbear doesn&#x27;t appear to support any Encrypt-then-MAC algorithms, so I can&#x27;t get my swarm of OpenWRT routers all green. reply heavyset_go 9 hours agoparentYou can replace Dropbear with OpenSSH on OpenWRT. reply yread 14 hours agoprev> (kex) ecdh-sha2-nistp521 -- [fail] using elliptic curves that are suspected as being backdoored by the U.S. National Security AgencyThat seems a bit paranoid reply candiddevmike 12 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s really no reason to use anything besides Ed25519 these days (openssh has supported it since 2014!).

In DayJob I run an SFTP-to-Azure-storage relay⁴ for clients to send automated feeds from third-party systems via that method⁵, and it wasn&#x27;t until one client reported getting the wrong fingerprint that we noticed we were outputting the UAT and Live system values back-to-front in the on-boarding details, and had been doing for some time so at least a few other clients⁶ had just blindly accepted a different fingerprint to the documented one…--[1] Anyone else remember way way way back² when browsers stopped trusting self-signed certificates, or at least started shouting loudly about them? There was many a heated discussion with some who kept repeating “well TOFU is good enough for SSH” and wouldn&#x27;t accept that 1. TOFU isn&#x27;t as secure as they think it is the way they are using it and 2. They were accepting the risk for only themselves³ with SSH & TOFU-done-a-bit-wrong, which might be OK to them, but with HTTPS+TOFU on public sites they were essentially making that risk choice for everyone, which is not OK.[2] somewhere in the very early 2000s?[3] and their users[4] Until recently there was no built-in support for this in Azure, and the recently-left-preview implementation is ~£186 per month per storage account which works out very expensive for our current storage-account-per-client layout (so without a refactor that might breach our client data separation policies running a small VM⁷ with my BIY service built around Blob-FUSE works out far cheaper)[5] We offer “more modern” APIs for such things too, but SFTP is still the most widely supported method (often the only supported method) by the other software&#x2F;infrastructure used by our clients[6] and these are investment banks, who you&#x27;d like to think were properly paranoid about a transport mechanism they&#x27;ll be sending business information and customer PII through…[7] actually, a couple of small VMs and a little infrastructure for HA reply j1elo 9 hours agorootparentTo be honest, this is a case of technology making humans work for it, instead of the other way around. By the design itself of TOFU, most users will trust the fingerprint because it looks like a weird string of random stuff and just pressing \"Y\" removes the question out of the way.If verifying the fingerprint is such a key aspect of TOFU, then the dialog should be an input instead of an output. \"Input here the expected fingerprint\" in order to allow connecting. You&#x27;d have received it by some other means, and would type or copy-paste it into the terminal to finish the verification process. Et voila, safe TOFU completed! reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentprevTofu literally means don’t verify, trust the first time you see it. Only complain if it changes later.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Trust_on_first_use reply Bu9818 6 hours agorootparentThe article linked includes OOB verification as a scenario in TOFU. From the perspective of the ssh client it&#x27;s TOFU (no CA chain for the client to perform a check), sure, that just means it&#x27;s up to the user to do the work and use ssh safely (either the server has a site posting the fingerprints like GitHub&#x2F;the AUR or you&#x27;re setting up the machine and have physical access, or maybe you&#x27;re using SSHFP).>If no identifier exists yet for the endpoint, the client software will either prompt the user to confirm they have verified the purported identifier is authentic, or if manual verification is not assumed to be possible in the protocol, the client will simply trust the identifier which was given and record the trust relationship into its trust database. reply rlpb 8 hours agorootparentprev> TOFU is secure if you verify the host key fingerprint against information received via a sufficiently secure channel.Verifying the fingerprint out-of-band is the opposite of TOFU. TOFU is generally understood to mean not verifying it, but flagging if it changes later. reply gertrunde 1 hour agorootparentVerifying the fingerprint out-of-band is very much what is meant to happen, but it&#x27;s like reading the EULA, everyone knows that you should do it, everyone knows that very very few people do. reply lmm 9 hours agorootparentprev> TOFU is secure if you verify the host key fingerprint against information received via a sufficiently secure channel.In other words it&#x27;s secure if you don&#x27;t do TOFU and do out-of-band verification instead. reply gertrunde 1 hour agorootparentJust because the user chooses not to bother with the verification step doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not part of the process. reply cuu508 21 minutes agorootparentA better acronym for that process would be VOFU. reply unethical_ban 4 hours agorootparentprevTrust doesn&#x27;t mean blindly trust, it means assert trust. reply pgraf 10 hours agoparentprev [–] For those wondering, TOFU means “trust on first use” here replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Even support for a private library of PDFs and EPubs! I seem to be having a little bit of trouble adding highlights to Epubs, but this is just about the perfect app.So now, it&#x27;s just a question of when the other shoe drops and they look at monetization. How much will it cost, what will the free version lose, what data of mine will be sold, etc?

I&#x27;m certainly not sure where how to turn it on on the web.

And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.I&#x27;m curious. Do you ever watch and enjoy movies from the 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s? For the silent flicks, do you think that the music played during the screening by some random starving artist plinking on a crummy piano or squeaking away on a violin is part of the \"vision\" of the director?Lots of people today simply turn away from any movie that is black and white. reply bredren 3 hours agorootparentI’d like to see rolling data on how people are turning away from lower quality media. Or what premium is being placed on 720p+ video versus standard.There’s a reason video sites offer a filter for HD and YouTube videos get keyword stuffed for 8k even when they aren’t.I am very curious how Apple’s spatial video lands.From reviewer descriptions, the experience is such a major change from standard HD video I am wondering if depthscaling “old” video will become a thing too. reply WalterBright 2 hours agorootparentPersonally, I find the constant breaking of the flow in a silent movie so the dialog card can be shown very irritating after a while. It&#x27;s also annoying that the card is shown for too long (for slow readers) and there&#x27;s a fair amount of dialog you can lip read that is not on the cards.I seriously doubt dialog cards are part of any director&#x27;s \"vision\".The bad music slapped on the DVDs is also a serious turnoff. Music easily makes or breaks a movie. For example, the music on Lord of the Rings adds greatly to my enjoyment of it. The Hobbit music is utterly forgettable, and makes the poor movie even worse.For another example, the movie \"Hawaii\" has a most excellent music soundtrack. Its sequel, \"The Hawaiians\", has a completely forgettable soundtrack, which contributes to the movie falling flat on its face.I suspect much of \"Star Wars\" success came from the music. reply bbarnett 1 hour agorootparentprevIf the colors are just someone guessing I would honestly not want to see it. I find those kind of wishful fantasies harmfulI think disclosure is high priority here. If you know it&#x27;s been cleaned up, and colourized, then you can watch it as you would the original.Because, what I think people are saying here is that older cameras already have made the equivalent of \"someone guessing\". The framerate is variable and jumps, the colour is off and variable, rhe film is degraded, and even the people in the films act quite unnatural, for they are very aware of being filmed.I get what you mean about authenticity, but I think full disclosure takes care of that. reply thsksbd 6 hours agorootparentprevAnother woman than a fake grandma replyWalterBright 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d like to see ML colorize, sharpen, etc., older B+W movies. Silent movies would be greatly improved with the addition of a soundtrack (music[2], foley effects[1], and replacing the dialog cards with voice actors).1. Yes, they already do add some foley effects. But very little.2. Yes, they do add a music soundtrack. But it&#x27;s almost always awful period music.> the ethical and artistic argumentsThose are all baloney. Doing what I suggest does not destroy the originals in any way.

Apparently, a lot of purists want people to suffer watching them: suffer with grainy, blotchy film, difficult to make out flickering black & white, and bad piano music.There&#x27;s a reddit newsgroup where people colorize old B+W photos. They really do an amazing job. By colorizing key frames in a movie, ML can take care of the rest.BTW, I&#x27;ve seen many bad attempts at colorizing old footage, like those \"WW2 In Color\" documentaries. You can always tell because the teeth & gums of the people are grey :-&#x2F; and the faces are a uniform brown.

Apparently, a lot of purists want people to suffer watching them: suffer with grainy, blotchy film, difficult to make out flickering black & white, and bad piano music.I think there&#x27;s 2 separate issues actually: there&#x27;s the \"artist&#x27;s intent\", and then there&#x27;s refusal to utilize any modern technology. The latter I agree is baloney: if you can use modern technology to clean up and improve old stuff (such as taking an original Star Wars film print and removing the scratches in the film, improving flaws in the FX, etc.), I think it&#x27;s ridiculous to argue against that kind of thing. Then there&#x27;s the artist&#x27;s intent: if the original artist intended that the movie have \"bad piano music\" as you call it, should you be changing that? It&#x27;s like changing the dialog in Lord of the Rings so the characters all talk like modern American hipsters: how is this helpful? These movies are a product of their time, and the music is too.If you could bring the original artists back from the dead, and ask them if they&#x27;d like to use modern technology to clean up their old silent movies to sharpen them, remove the noise, etc., I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d agree: why wouldn&#x27;t they want the print to look as good as possible? If you ask them about colorizing, there might be some debate; some might like it, others might not. It&#x27;s not like they had a choice back then, but even today some people like B&W photos for artistic reasons. If you ask them about adding modern music, I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d like that much at all. reply WalterBright 5 hours agorootparentHow many movie arteests today would choose black and white? A number indistinguishable from zero. How many would choose dialog cards over voice? Zilch. How many would make a film and says to the movie theater \"play any music you want for the show\"? Zip.If I made a movie, I&#x27;d be pleased if people far in the future watched it. If that meant using their technology to improve it, that&#x27;s fine with me. After all, I&#x27;ve suggested to many people that they improve my game Empire with modern graphics and AI and sound. reply JoelEinbinder 5 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think you can change a work that drastically without the change itself being a piece of art. And the original artists might not want to be left out of that process.

Apparently, a lot of purists want people to suffer watching themThe tech and information of the time is worth preserving, as is the experience. I, for one, enjoy seeing the original, more analog versions of things. I cringe inside when I watch much of ML filtered or otherwise artificially colorized footage. Many films were shot with the intent of leveraging the strengths of the medium. Limitation often promotes its own form of innovation which can only be recognized in the context it was created in.Saying that purists want people to suffer is quite misleading. A similar statement in the other direction might be, ML enthusiasts want people to forget what art actually is.Ever listen to a Gregorian chant? They are cool, partially because they had no idea what they were (musically) doing... much like the product of an ML model today. reply WalterBright 5 hours agorootparent> Saying that purists want people to suffer is quite misleadingNot at all. I&#x27;ve watched enough movies where the director clearly wanted the viewer to suffer, based on the idea that only through suffering can the viewer be enlightened. The suffering is in the form of making a bad movie.Solaris comes to mind. I&#x27;ve tried to watch it multiple times, but the director (and the director&#x27;s fans) clearly revel in the notion that one must suffer through the movie, and that&#x27;s the point of it. The movie is boring on every level - bad dialog, bad plot, bad cinematography, bad pacing, bad acting, everything is bad about it. And it&#x27;s (small) number of fervent fans love it for its wretchedness. They can keep it :-)I saw a colorized version of Metropolis a few decades ago. The technology to do it right wasn&#x27;t there, but it was enjoyable in a way the original was not. I&#x27;ve since watched the full version when the missing footage was found, and there&#x27;s an ideal film that would benefit from the application of modern technology. I bet Fritz Lang would love it.TCM also ran a version of the silent \"Wings\". They added some color in a few spots, and some airplane engine sounds. Even just that little bit made the picture much more watchable.I&#x27;d like to see the FM Busby musicals fixed up.Some movies I wouldn&#x27;t touch would be Top Hat.

Whether that approximation is improved by color data added at time of capture or a century later, or if the image is cleaned up by AI instead of a human, doesn&#x27;t change that fact.Most images taken with a smartphone today don&#x27;t capture reality reliably either, and you&#x27;re allowed to alter them to look whichever way is most pleasing.Even our eyes perceive reality slightly differently, and photography is not much different.

Twain reluctantly agreed as long as the material was never used for any other purpose. The intro consisted an edited version of the first three scenes of this film. Scenes included: Twain standing in the doorway, the walk around the house, and the second walk around was another \"take\" to cover a late camera start on the part of the cinematographer.Since there was still unexposed film left over, it was at the film crew’s urging that the scenes with Twain and his daughters, Clara and Jean, be photographed as a gift with the promise that footage was strictly for their own private enjoyment. reply fsckboy 6 hours agorootparentprevI would think it would depend on the year. When he first invented it, probably him. Later on when he was selling the things, not.Edison was obsessed with making money from the patents he had, applying them to anybody making movies; the reason Hollywood (the industry) is in LA is that filmmakers fled the East Coast to the wild west to get away from Edison&#x27;s lawsuits.so perhaps (speculating) if Edison was spending a lot of time with lawyers, I tend to doubt he was doing the filming.Mark Twain was a celebrity though, so perhaps it was a friendly visit. reply shiroiuma 6 hours agorootparentPerhaps it was shot in Toronto by a detective with the Toronto Constabulary... reply dang 5 hours agoparentprevOk, we&#x27;ve reverted the title now.

    "originBody": "Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to footer HOME ABOUT Science & technology experiments coding, data science, ml, cloud, greentech Causal inference as a blind spot of data scientists by Dzidas Martinaitis 2023-10-15 CATEGORIES ml Throughout much of the 20th century, frequentist statistics dominated the field of statistics and scientific research. Frequentist statistics primarily focus on the analysis of data in terms of probabilities and observed frequencies. Causal inference, on the other hand, involves making inferences about cause-and-effect relationships, which often goes beyond the scope of traditional frequentist statistical methods. Causal inference has a long history, but it gained more prominent attention in the latter half of the 20th century. This increased interest was partly due to advancements in statistical methods and the development of causal inference frameworks. In the 1980s, the work of Judea Pearl on causal inference significantly contributed to the field which continued into the 21st century. Economists and social scientists were among the first to recognize the advantages of these emerging causal inference techniques and incorporated in their research. However, based on my personal anecdote, the data science community didn’t truly prioritize causal inference until around 2015 or later. It was during this period that less technically oriented economists faced significant challenges related to the scaling of big data, prompting them to seek assistance from data scientists. Unfortunately, data scientists often lacked the necessary expertise in causal inference, resulting in limited knowledge transfer to business stakeholders. As a result, we, the data scientists, missed an important development for quite a bit, so let’s catch up on that! What is causal inference? New York in the parallel worlds To explain causal inference, I like an analogy of a parallel or alternative world. Nowadays, with the help of GenerativeAI, we can really simulate or create new worlds. Have you ever wondered how New York would be if the Aztecs would take over of Americas? Or what if the Roman Empire still ruled the world? Now, how does this relate to data science and business decisions? Well, businesses make important choices every day, like where to invest money, who to hire or fire, and what the consequences of public policies might be. The data they collect only shows one side of reality. To really understand the results of their decisions, they need to explore an unseen or simulated reality. That’s where causal inference comes in, helping us make better decisions by considering alternative outcomes. Let’s take an example to make it clear. Imagine you’re in charge of expanding the business of a company that makes snack bars for kids. Your goal is to boost sales, and you’re considering adding more sugar to your products because you have a hunch that kids love sugar. After enchancing all your snacks with sugar, you want to measure its impact. You want to know how much your sales would be in a parallel world where kids were stuck with bland snacks compared to your sweet treats. This is where causal inference steps in to provide the solution. Sales of sweet snacks vs bland snacks The chart above illustrates the difference between an observed scenario represented by the red line and an unobserved scenario represented by the black line. The technical term for the black line is ‘counterfactual’—it represents what the sales would be if we didn’t enhance the snacks with sugar. To continue this intriguing story, let’s fast forward a bit. Now, you’re the CEO of the same company, which has gained international recognition and is traded on stock markets worldwide. However, recently, some pesky Facebook groups formed by moms and dads have launched a public campaign, claiming that your products and the entire concept behind them are making their children overweight and prone to diabetes. In an effort to address these concerns and launch a PR campaign, you reach out to a university with whom you’ve collaborated in the past to improve your products. You ask them to investigate these claims. To your surprise, they request the same sales data that initially sparked the sugary product campaign. A few nights later, an underpaid PhD student conducts a causal inference analysis, constructs counterfactuals and uncovers the following findings. Percentage of people with diabetes, simulated data Upon seeing these results, you become convinced that there is a conspiracy against you and your company. You quickly instruct your lawyers to halt any further funding to the university and come up with a plan to take legal action against all parties threatening you. From this intriguing tale, we can take two valuable lessons about how Causal Inference played a pivotal role in two critical business scenarios: Assesing the impact on sales by adding more sugar to your products. Assessing the effects of a sugary diet on children’s health. Here are more examples of causal inference: Effect of attending a data science meetup on a person’s future and earnings Air quality and free public transport Percentage of electric vehicles and air quality Impact of your campaigns (sales, marketing or support) on the revenue, profit, employees satisfaction and etc. A product or service price change on the demand Running a causal inference analysis Looking back at our fictional story, the lawyers could raise a valid argument that association or correlation doesn’t necessarily imply causation. In simpler terms, just because there’s a correlation between high sugar consumption and an increase in the number of people with diabetes doesn’t mean that one directly causes the other. It’s another case of a spurious correlation, isn’t it? Take, for example, the high correlation between umbrellas and wet streets. Does that imply that people with umbrellas cause puddles on the streets? Of course not. It’s more likely that a common factor, in this case, a rain (or, using the technical term, a confounder), affects both variables. Now, the question is how can we estimate the impact given that there is a causal link between diabetes and a sugary diet? One approach to understanding the impact of sugary snack consumption on diabetes risk would involve conducting an experiment. In this experiment, children would be randomly assigned to receive either unsweetened or sugary snacks. After a decade, we’d analyze how many children developed diabetes in each group and calculate any observed differences. If differences exist, we could confidently attribute them to causation since the random assignment eliminates biases. However, I can already see parents rolling their eyes and rightly questioning my moral values. And they’re correct - we can’t conduct cruel experiments on children or people. Secondly, it would take 10 years to figure out the difference, and thirdly, there are other biases to consider. Last but not least, it would be really expensive. Linear regression Let’s set aside for the moment the need to estimate causal impact and explore modeling the problem using linear regression. If we represent snack consumption as a binary variable (sugary or not), we can proceed as follows: Now, here comes the exciting part – we can enhance our model by incorporating all the additional variables available to us. In our example, we might have access to demographic data, an individual’s activity or behavioral information. For instance, we can consider factors like how frequently and for how many hours a person exercises each week, their dietary habits, and so on. X_i denotes extra variables what we might include You might be wondering whether adding more variables to the model is a good idea, and the short answer is: it depends. When dealing with a causal question, it’s crucial to include variables known as confounders. These are variables that can influence both the treatment and the outcome. By including confounding variables, we can better isolate and estimate the true causal effect of the treatment. Failing to add or account for confounding variables may lead to incorrect estimates. Example of a confounder Additionally, including variables that are only predictors of the outcome can be beneficial. It reduces the variance and allows for a more precise estimation of the causal effect. However, adding a variable that predicts only the treatment can lead to a less accurate estimation of causal effect. This occurs because it increases the variance, making it more challenging to estimate the causal effect accurately. It is worth to emphasize, that a regression model gives an average estimate based on the given inputs. In causal inference, this outcome is referred to as the average treatment effect, ATE, which provides an estimation across the entire group, rather than on an individual basis. Depending on the problem at hand, you might need to estimate an individual treatment effect. The Synthetic Control method, discussed below, allows you to assess the impact at an individual level. Causal graphical models Now that we’ve discussed the cases to consider, let’s dive into the process of deciding which variables to include and which to omit in your model. Causal graphical models, championed by Jude Pearl since the 1980s, offer an appealing approach at first glance. The fundamental concept is to construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that contains all variables in your analysis. Using this graphical representation you can make informed decisions about which variables to retain and which to exclude. In this framework, each node in the graph represents a variable, and an arrow pointing to another node signifies a causal relationship. The process of constructing this graph involves utilizing three building blocks: a pipe, a fork, and a collider, which help describe the causal flow between variables. This approach forces you to engage in a thoughtful and clarifying exploration of your model’s causal structure. From left to right: a pipe, a fork and a collider While learning about causal graphs can be challenging, it offers substantial benefits in understanding and addressing various causal inference problems and their solutions. Some argue that this approach doesn’t scale well on a model with +20 input variables. In my experience, most of the time we start with a limited set of variables and build the derivatives of these variables. Therefore, there is an opportunity to build a structural map on the primary variables in most of the cases. Additionally, to alleviate the pain and speedup process, frameworks such as DoWhy and econml have been developed. In summary, starting your modeling journey with a causal graph may indeed be a challenging task, however it is a proven framework to get a robust and insightful model. Instrumental Variable In a nutshell, the causal graph should facilitate a solution of a causal problem. However, there many methods to tackle the problem depending what data and challenge you have at hands. Instrumental Variable (IV) method is quite unique. In theory, it seems like a magical solution — you find a variable that has a causal link to a treatment, but doesn’t impact the outcome directly, and voilà, you’ve cracked the code of causation. However, there’s a crucial requirement: the IV must remain completely unrelated to any unobservable factors. This means you need prior knowledge ensuring that the treatment and the outcome have no connections with any variables — an undertaking that can be quite challenging, if not nearly impossible, in the real world. In my experience, I haven’t come across any instances of its use, but interestingly, nearly every causal inference course dedicates a chapter to this intriguing concept. Difference in Differences DiD is a straightforward method that can be implemented in Excel without the need for advanced tools. The concept revolves around comparing two versions of a subject or a unit under investigation: one before a particular event or treatment and the other after. To enhance the analysis, you introduce a control group — a similar entity that remains unaffected by the treatment. What are the potential effects of a young girl taking her chemistry classes seriously Let’s consider an illustrative example: before the introduction of the free transport policy in San Diego, the average air pollution level was 10. After the policy was implemented, it decreased to 8. However, we can’t simply subtract 10 from 8, as it would yield biased results. To address this issue, we turn to data from a neighboring city, Tijuana, located just across the border. In Tijuana, the pollution level before the policy was 11, and after its introduction, it dropped to 10. Notably, Tijuana was not affected by the policy. Applying this approach, we find that the bias reduction diminishes the impact from -2 to -1. Synthetic control In our previous example, we made an assumption that the cities were similar, with the treatment being the only differing factor. Furthermore, we simplified the problem by considering only four parameters, which inevitably introduced a degree of uncertainty into our estimation. But what if we had access to a wealth of data from various units (cities in the previous example) and the ability to observe changes over time? Enter the word of Synthetic Control. Like a magician, we build a synthetic twin for our treatment group. To do that, we take the treatment group and regress against a bunch of similar units, and with regularization, we select the most relevant features and determine their weights. For instance, let’s evaluate the impact of Mark Zuckerberg having children on teenagers’ happiness in social networks. In order to construct a synthetic control group, we certainly include Bezos, Musk, and Gates, but we might also add Jon from the UK and Guiseppe from France. Never heard of the latter two? That’s precisely the point! With this model, built from data preceding the event (Zuckerberg having children), we project the data into the future, thereby generating our imaginery future, namely counterfactuals, which gives us a way to measure the impact. Fictitious example Previously, we discussed the average treatment effect, a measure that helps us estimate the overall causal impact on a treatment group. Now, with the synthetic control method, it becomes possible to estimate an individual treatment effect (in this case, the effect of Zuckerberg having children), provided that we have a sufficient amount of data to create a synthetic control. Now, lets magic fade and look at disadvangates of synthetic control. The method assumes that all potential confounding variables are measured and controlled for as with linear regression. The synthetic control method assumes that the pre-treatment data accurately represent the underlying data-generating process. And on top of that, you get the standard ML problems - overfitting, difficult to validate (but not impossible) just to name few. Double ML Since the ’90s, when causal inference gained popularity, the data landscape has changed significantly. More often than not, we now find ourselves dealing with enormous amounts of data for a given problem, often without a clear understanding of how all the variables interconnect. In theory, DoubleML can be helpful in such cases. The DoubleML method is founded on machine learning modeling and consists of two key steps. First, we build a model m(X) that predicts the treatment variable T based on the input variables X. Then, we create a separate model g(X) that predicts the outcome variable Y using the same set of input variables X. Subsequently, we calculate the residuals from the former model and regress them against the residuals from the latter model. An important feature of this method is its flexibility in accommodating non-linear models, which allows us to capture non-linear relationships — a distinctive advantage of this approach. Consider using DoubleML when you have high-dimensional data (many features) or when the relationships between inputs and treatment/outcome are not linear. DoubleML is particularly useful when you need to estimate treatment effects that vary across different subgroups or individuals. However, it’s essential to remember that DoubleML cannot magically eliminate the influence of poorly considered confounding variables.

I remember running an analysis that found that gender was a significant explaining factor for behavior on our site; my boss asked (dismissively): What can we do with that information? If there is an assumption of how things work that doesn’t translate to a product change, that insight isn’t useful; if there is a product intuition, testing the product change itself is key, and there’s no reason to delay that.There are cases where RCTs are hard to organize (for example, multi-sided platform businesses) of changes that can’t be tested in isolation (major brand changes). Those tend to benefit from the techniques described there——and they have dedicated teams. But this is a classic case of a complicated tool that doesn’t fit most use cases. reply riedel 17 hours agoparentActually causal inference is also really hard to benchmark. My colleague started an effort to be actually able to reproduce and compare results. Also the algorithms often do not scale too well.Everytime we wanted to use this for real data it is just a little bit too much effort and the results are not conclusive because it is hard to verify huge graphs. My colleague e.g. wanted to apply it explain risk confounders in investment funds.I personally also do not like the definition of causality they base it on. reply Dzidas 16 hours agorootparentOne way to test this is through a placebo test, where you shift the treatment, such as moving it to an earlier date, which I have seen used successfully in practice.

I’m worried that you both have worked for companies where a lot of work has been done to identify relevant dimensions (metrics and categories) and automate causality (or rather: estimating factors on a pre-existing causal graph because that’s the slight of hands the word “causality” does) made sense once you’ve reached that level of maturity.But to reach that point, before having relevant dimensions, there has to be a lot of work, generally motivated by disappointing experiments. “Why didn’t that work?” is often answered by “Because our goal is too remote from our actions—here’s a better proxy” or “Because this change only makes sense to 8% of our users, here’s how we can split them.”I’m worried that too many people will think the tool itself is enough and not a complement to the maturity in understanding a company’s user.

It takes a perfect storm natural experiment to get any good results. Plus every 5 years a paper comes out that refutes all previous papers that use whatever method was in vogue at the time.This article makes me want to get back into this type of thinking though. It’s refreshing after years of reading hand-wavy deep learning papers where SOTA is king and most theoretical thinking seems to occur post hoc, the day of the submission deadline. reply mmmmpancakes 10 hours agoparentYeah, the only common theme I see in causal inference research is that every method and analysis eventually succumbs to a more thorough analysis that uncovers serious issues in the assumptions.Take for instance the running example of catholic schoolings effect on test scores used by the boook Counterfactuals and Causal Inference. Subsequent chapter re-treat this example with increasingly sophisticated techniques and more complex assumptions about causal mechanisms, and each time they uncover a flaw in the analysis using techniques from previous chapters.My lesson from this: outcomes causal inference is very dependent on assumptions and methodologies, of which the options are many. This is a great setting for publishing new research, but its the opposite of what you want in an industry setting where the bias is&#x2F;should be towards methods that are relatively quick to test and validate and put in production.I see researchers in large tech companies pushing for causal methodologies, but I&#x27;m not convinced they&#x27;re doing anything particularly useful since I have yet to see convincing validation on production data of their methods that show they&#x27;re better than simpler alternatives which will tend to be more robust. reply Trombone12 9 hours agorootparent> My lesson from this: outcomes causal inference is very dependent on assumptions and methodologies, of which the options are many.This seems like a natural feature of any sensitive method, not sure why this is something to complain about.

Today most tech companies worship a&#x2F;b experiments as the main way of being data-driven and bringing causality into decision-making. It deserves to be the gold standard.However, most experiments are usually expensive: they require investing in building the feature in question and then collecting data for 1-4 weeks before being certain of the effects (plus there are long-term ones to worry about). Some companies report that fewer than 50% of their experiments prove truly impactful (my experience as well). That’s why only a small number of business decisions are made using experiments today.Observational causal inference offers another approach, trading off full confidence in causality with speed and cost. It was pretty hard to run correctly so far, so it is not widely adopted.

My biggest concern is falsification of hypotheses. In ML, you have a clear mechanism to check estimation&#x2F;prediction through holdout approaches. In classical metrics, you have model metrics that can be used to define reasonable rejection regions for hypothesis tests. But causal inference doesn&#x27;t seem to have this, outside traditional model fit metrics or ML holdout assessment? So the only way a model is deemed acceptable is by prior biases?If my understanding is right, this means that each model has to be hand-crafted, adding significant technical debt to complex systems, and we can&#x27;t get ahead of the assessment.

If your train and test data are too similar then no holdout will help you measure generalization. You have to remember that datasets are proxies for the thing you&#x27;re actually trying to model, they are not the thing you are modeling themselves. You can usually see this when testing on in class but out of train&#x2F;test distribution data (e.g. data from someone else).You have to be careful because there are a lot of small and non-obvious things that can fuck up statistics. There&#x27;s a lot of aggregation \"paradoxes\" (Simpsons, Berkson&#x27;s), and all kinds of things that can creep in. This is more perilous the bigger your model too. The story of the Monte Hall problem is a great example of how easy it is to get the wrong answer while it seems like you&#x27;re doing all the right steps.For the article, the author is far too handwavy with causal inference. The reason we tend not to do it is because it is fucking hard and it scales poorly. Models like Autoregressive (careful here) and Normalizing Flows can do causal inference (and causal discovery) fwiw (essentially you need explicit density models with tractable densities: referring to Goodfellow&#x27;s taxonomy). But things get funky as you get a lot of variables because there are indistinguishable causal graphs (see Hyvarien and Pajunen). Then there&#x27;s also the issues with the types of causalities (see Judea&#x27;s Ladder) and counterfactual inference is FUCKING HARD but the author just acts like it&#x27;s no big deal. Then he starts conflating it with weaker forms of causal inference. Correlation is the weakest form of causation, despite our often chanted saying of \"correlation does not equate to causation\" (which is still true, it&#x27;s just in the class and the saying is more getting at confounding variable). This very much does not scale. Similarly discovery won&#x27;t scale as you have to permute so many variables in the graph. The curse of dimensionality hits causal analysis HARD. reply mjburgess 17 hours agoparentprevTo be clear, the mechanism for checking ML doesn&#x27;t really check ML. There&#x27;s really little value in a confidence interval conditional on the same experimental conditions that produced the dataset on which the model is trained. I&#x27;d often say it&#x27;s actively harmful, since it&#x27;s mostly misleading.Insofar as causal inference has no such &#x27;check&#x27;, its because there never was any. Casual inference is about dispelling that illusion. reply tomrod 17 hours agorootparent> Insofar as causal inference has no such &#x27;check&#x27;, its because there never was any.

How to know if model 1 or model 2 is more \"real\" or, for my lack of a better term, more useful and reflective of reality?We can focus on a particular philosophical point, like parsimony &#x2F; Occam&#x27;s razor, but as far as I can tell that isn&#x27;t always sufficient.There should be some way to determine a model&#x27;s likelihood of structure beyond \"trust me, it works!\" If there is, I&#x27;m trying to understand it! reply godelski 16 hours agorootparent> How to know if model 1 or model 2 is more \"real\" or, for my lack of a better term, more useful and reflective of reality?I just want to second MJ&#x27;s points here. You have to remember that 1) all models are wrong and 2) it&#x27;s models all the way down. Your data is a model: it models the real world distribution, what we might call the target distribution, which is likely intractable and often very different from your data in various conditions. Your metrics are models: obviously given the previous point, but not as obvious from the point that even with perfect data these are still models. Your metrics all have limitations and you must be careful to clearly understand what they are measuring, rather than what you think they are. This is an issue of alignment and the vast majority of people do not consider precisely what their metrics mean and instead rely on the general consensus (great ML example: FID does not measure fidelity, it is distance measurement of distributions. But you shouldn&#x27;t stop there, that&#x27;s the start). These get especially fuzzy in higher dimensions where geometries are highly non-intuitive. It is best to remember that metrics are guides and not targets (Goodhart).> There should be some way to determine a model&#x27;s likelihood of structure beyond \"trust me, it works!\" If there is, I&#x27;m trying to understand it!I mean we can use likelihood ;) if we model density of course. But that&#x27;s not the likelihood that your model is the correct model, it is the likelihood that given the data that you have that your model&#x27;s parameterization can reasonably model the sampling distribution of data. These are subtly different, the difference is from above. And then we gotta know if you&#x27;re actually operating on the right number of dimensions. Are you approximating PCA like a typical VAE? Is the bottleneck enough for proper parameterization? Is your data in sufficient dimensionality? Does the fucking manifold hypothesis even hold for your data? What about the distribution assumption? IID? And don&#x27;t get me started on indistinguishablity in large causal graphs (references in another comment).So rather in practice it is just best to try to make a model that is robust to your data but always maintain suspicion of it. After all, all models are wrong and you&#x27;re trying to model data, not have a model of data.Evaluation is fucking hard (it is far too easy to make mistakes) reply tomrod 16 hours agorootparentI love this comment to bits.

That&#x27;s a problem with reality, and us.I&#x27;d take a bayesian approach across an ensemble of models based on the risk of each being right&#x2F;wrong.Consider whether Drug A causes or cures cancer. If there&#x27;s some circumstantial evidence of it causing cancer at rate X in population Y with risk factors Z -- and otherwise broad circumstial evidence of it curing at rate A in pop B with features C...then what? Then create various scenarios under these (likely contradictory) assumptions. Formulate an appropriate risk. Derive some implied policies.This is the reality of how almost all actual decisions are made in life, and necessarily so.The real danger is when ML is used to replace that, and you end up with extremely fragile systems that automate actions of unknown risk -- on the basis they were \"99.99%\", \"accurate\", ie., considered uncontrolled experimental condition E1 and not E2...10_0000 which actually occur reply nyssos 17 hours agorootparentprev> How to know if model 1 or model 2 is more \"real\" or, for lack of a better term, more useful and reflective of reality?You don&#x27;t.

Identifying the exact causal structure requires intervening experimentally.> There should be some way to determine a model&#x27;s likelihood of structureWhy? If the information isn&#x27;t there, it isn&#x27;t there. No technique can change that. reply bangkoksbest 8 hours agorootparentAcyclic structure on variables is a very strong pre-supposition that, honestly, is not how many systems in engineering are well-described by, so I don&#x27;t like this idea of boiling causality solely down to DAG-dependent phrases like \"d-separation\" or \"exact causal structure\". Exact causal structure a.k.a. actual causality is particular to one experimental run on one intervention. reply nyssos 6 hours agorootparentD-separation still works for cyclic graphs, it just can&#x27;t rule out causal relationships between variables that lie on the same cycle. And neither can any other functional-form-agnostic method, because in general feedback loops really do couple everything to everything else.More rigorously: given a graph G for a structural equation model S, construct a DAG G&#x27; as follows- Find a minimal subgraph C_i transitively closed under cycle membership (so a cycle, all the cycles it intersects, all the cycles they intersect, and so on)- Replace each C_i with a complete graph C&#x27;_i on the same number of vertices, preserving outgoing edges.- Add edges from the parents of any vertices in C_i (if not in C_i themselves) to all vertices in C&#x27;_i- Repeat until acyclicd-separation in G&#x27; then entails independence in S given reasonable smoothness assumptions I don&#x27;t remember the details of off the top of my head. reply kjkjadksj 17 hours agorootparentprevThere is though. You run two linear models you get numbers back that inform how well these different models are fitting to the data. reply nyssos 16 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t a quality of fit issue (and even if it were, linear models are not always sufficient). The problem is that different causal structures can entail the same set of correlations, which makes them impossible to distinguish through observation alone. reply tomrod 16 hours agorootparentGrandparent commenter here -- I&#x27;m glad I sufficiently communicated my concern, I feel like you and mjburgess have nailed it. Fit metrics alone aren&#x27;t sufficient to determine an appropriate model use (even ignoring the issues of p-hacking an other ills). replymumblemumble 17 hours agoprevI would argue it&#x27;s more a blind spot of big data, which tends to tacitly imply just doing correlational studies on data that happens to be laying around.Most data scientists work for companies that don&#x27;t really want to pay for controlled experiments outside of maybe letting the UI team do A&#x2F;B tests. Natural experiments can be hard to come by in a business setting. And all of the wild mathematical gyrations that econometricians and political scientists have developed to try to do causal inference from correlational data have a tendency not to be as popular in business because, outside of some special domains such as politics and consumer finance, it can be rather difficult to get away with dressing your emperor in math that nobody can understand instead of actual clothing. reply atrettel 12 hours agoparentExactly. This is the primary difference between observational and experimental studies (controlled experiments). Experimental studies control for the hypothesized mechanism as part of the experimental design, but observation studies do not or often cannot. Good data from controlled experiments is difficult, costly, and time-consuming to generate in general, and that often does not mesh with the notion of \"big data\". I think we are running into this problem more and more as we discover that our data sets really are superficial --- collections of a lot of data that is easy to collect rather than a representative sample of everything (especially in a controlled manner). Good data isn&#x27;t cheap. reply shahbazac 13 hours agoprevI’ve tried to understand causal inference several times and failed. Tutorials seem unnecessarily long winded.

More columns of data? Explicit assumptions?If I can use causal inference, what can it tell me? If I think of it as a function CA(data), can it tell me if the relationship is actually causal? Can it tell me the direction of the relationship? If there were more columns, could it return a graph of causal relationships and their strength? Or do I need to provide that graph to this function?I know a wet pavement can be caused by rain or spilled water or that an alarm can go off due to an earthquake or a burglary. I have common sense. I also understand the basics of graph traversal from comp sci classes.How do I practically use causal inference?To the authors of future articles on this (or any technical tutorial), please explain the essence, the easy path, then the caveats and corner cases. Only then will abstract philosophizing make sense. reply jldugger 11 hours agoparent> Say I have a simple table of outdoor temperatures and ice cream sales. What can the machinery of causal inference do for me in this situation?Not much. Causal inference works over networks of variables, specifically a DAG. But usually you know more than one variable association, so this is more an issue of pedagogy than the tool itself.Probably the shortest, most persuasive example I can give you is a logical resolution to Simpson&#x27;s Paradox: when the correlation between two variables can change depending on whether you consider a third variable or not.The classic example is gender discrimination in college admissions. When looking at admissions rates across the entire university, women are less likely to be accepted than men. But when (in this example) you break that down into departments, every department favors women over men. This is a paradoxical contradiction, and worrying in that your science is only as good as the dimensions your data captures. Worse, the data offers no clean way to say which is the correct answer: the aggregate or the total. Statisticians stumbled for a long while on this, and it&#x27;s kind of wild that we were able to declare smoking causes cancer without a resolution to this.Pearl wrote a paper on how bayesian approaches resolve the paradox[1], but it does presume familiarity with terms like \"colliders,\" \"backdoor criterion\" and \"do-calculus.\" His main point is that causal inference techniques give us the language and tools to resolve the paradox that frequentist approaches do not.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ftp.cs.ucla.edu&#x2F;pub&#x2F;stat_ser&#x2F;r414.pdf reply FreakLegion 6 hours agorootparentWhen looking at admissions rates across the entire university, women are less likely to be accepted than men. But when (in this example) you break that down into departments, every department favors women over men.If every department favored women then the entire university would also favor women. Parity is guaranteed in that scenario. What happened in the Berkeley case is that not every department favored women, and women applied disproportionately to the departments with lower admissions rates (including some that didn&#x27;t favor them), while men did the opposite. reply jldugger 5 hours agorootparentYes, apologies, what I meant by \"favored\" was that in every department, women applicants were more likely to get an admission than men. But I&#x27;m pretty sure the admission rate can still be lower for women overall than men overall, using exactly the same scenario you described. If the sociology department admits 10 percent of applicants and the physics department admits 90, it seems very easy for gender bias in applications to shift women towards 10 and men towards 90, even if the rate is a few percent higher for women. reply FreakLegion 1 hour agorootparentI get your point now. You&#x27;re quite right that you can construct scenarios that arbitrarily favor men in the aggregate but women in specific departments, given the right ratio of applicants. reply bertil 5 hours agoparentprev> Or do I need to provide that graph to this function?You need to do that, and the math can help you measure how much each arrow contributes. The idea that you need to provide your model of the world is strangely not a key part of most introductions, but it’s crucial.> outdoor temperatures and ice cream salesThat’s too simple: a simple regression can handle that. Causal inference can handle cases with three variables, assuming you provide an interaction graph. Say: your ice cream truck goes either to a fancy neighborhood or a working-class plaza. After observing the weather, you decide where to go, so know that wealth and weather influence sales, but sales can’t influence the other two. Assuming you have data all for cases (sunny&#x2F;poor, sunny&#x2F;rich, rainy&#x2F;poor, rainy&#x2F;rich), then you can separate the two effects. reply srean 45 minutes agorootparent> > outdoor temperatures and ice cream sales > That’s too simple: a simple regression can handle that.Not quite. Regression by itself will not answer the causal (or equivalently, the counterfactual) question.I strongly suspect you already know this and was elaborating on a related point. But just for the sake of exposition, let me add a few words for the HN audience at large.Let me give an example. In an email corpus, mails that begin with \"Honey sweetheart,\" will likely have a higher than baseline open rate. A regression on word features will latch on to that. However, if your regular employer starts leading with \"Honey sweetheart\" that will not increase the open rate of corporate communications.Causal or counterfactual estimation is fundamentally about how a dependent variable responds to interventional changes in a causal variable. Regression and relatedly, conditional probabilities are about &#x27;filtering&#x27; the population on some predicate.An email corpus when filtered upon the opening phrase \"Honey sweetheart\" may have disproportionately high email open rates, but that does not mean that adding or adopting such a leading phrase will increase the open rate.Similarly, regressing dark hair as a feature against skin cancer propensity will catch an anti-correlation effect. Dyeing blonde hair dark will not reduce melanoma propensity. reply salty_biscuits 12 hours agoparentprevMy understanding (that might be out of date) is that the tools are weak. Ideally you would have tabular data and it would give you a digraph for the causal structure between variables. You can try this but the tools don&#x27;t work reliably yet. Otherwise everyone would use them. reply lmeyerov 12 hours agorootparentAgreed. Afaict, in practice, you setup your own casual graphs and test them.

More columns of data? Explicit assumptions?The first thing you need to do is articulate what you’re actually interested in. Then you need to be explicit about the causal relationships between things relevant to those questions. The big thing (to me) is that particular causal structures have testable conditional independence structures and by assessing these, you can build evidence for or against particular diagrams of the context. reply satvikpendem 12 hours agoparentprevJudea Pearl&#x27;s The Book Of Why gives you more practical and easy to understand examples, I recommend that. reply oldgradstudent 11 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty simple.

The issue is that to do anything useful with it at scale you either need MCMC or variational inference and that&#x27;s an entirely different bag of worms all together. For medical datasets you rarely have \"scale\", instead you have very few sample cases and a large expert model (the doctor&#x2F;specialist). reply mwexler 17 hours agoprevI 100% agree with this blind spot. Most data science coursework avoids the very thing making it a science: the explanation of what change causes what effect. I&#x27;ve been surprised that year after year, programs at so many \"Schools of Data Science\" keep gliding over this area, perhaps alluding to it in an early stats course if at all.It&#x27;s an important part of validating that your data-driven output or decision is actually creating the change you hope for. So many fields either do poor experimentation or none at all, others are prevented from doing the usual \"full unrestricted RCT\": med and fin svcs and other regulated industries have legal constraints on what they can experiment with; in other cases, data privacy restricts the measures one can take.I&#x27;ve had many data folks throw up their hands if they can&#x27;t do a full RCT, and instead look to pre-post with lots of methodological errors. You can guess how many of those projects end up. (No, not every change needs a full test, and some things are easy rollback. But think of how many others would have benefitted from some uncertainty reduction.)Sure, \"LLM everything\" and \"just gbm it!\" and \"ok, just need a new feature table and I&#x27;m done!\" are all important and fun parts of a data science day. But if I can&#x27;t show that a data driven decision or output makes things better, then it&#x27;s just noise.Causal modeling gets us there. It improves the impact of ml models that recognize the power of causal interventions, and it gives us evidence that we are helping (or harming).It&#x27;s (IMO) necessary, but of course, not sufficient. Lots of other great things are done by ML eng and data scientists and data eng and the rest, having nothing to do with casual inference... But I keep thinking how much better things get when we apply a causal lens to our work.(And next on my list would be having more data folks understanding slowly changing dimension tables, but this can wait for another time). reply rcthompson 17 hours agoparentI realize this is nitpicking a minor point in your comment, but I don&#x27;t agree with your characterization of RCTs in medical research as being primarily constrained by laws and regulations. Any time I&#x27;ve discussed research on human subjects with doctors doing that research, the discussion of what is and is not an acceptable experiment has always been primarily driven by the risks of harm to the people involved in the study. Any time the law comes up, it&#x27;s usually because the law requires an RCT in a specific setting, as opposed to preventing it (e.g. drug trials). (Of course in the setting of starting a company based on some medical product, the situation may be quite different.)Biologists, if not data scientists, are used to considering indirect evidence for causality. It&#x27;s why we sometimes accept studies performed in other organisms as evidence for biology in humans; it&#x27;s why we sometimes accept research performed on post-mortem human tissue as being representative of the biology of living humans; to name but a few examples. A big part of a compelling high-impact biology (or bioinformatics) paper is often the innovative ways that one comes up to show causality when a direct RCT is not feasible, and papers are frequently rejected because they don&#x27;t to the follow-up experiments required to show causality. reply mwexler 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a very fair point. I didn&#x27;t mean to suggest that harm to the patients or subjects was not the overriding factor, nor that bio, pharma, and other medical fields never do RCTs.But there are a slew of laws and requirements around _how_ to run an RCT across the world of bio-related work, esp as it becomes a product. From marketing to manufacture to packaging, there are strict limits around where variation is allowed, at least anything involving the FDA in the US. (Some would say too many regs, others say not enough).And in those cases, having a wider collection of ways to impute cause would be great. reply gordon_freeman 5 hours agoprevThere is an excellent video on YouTube by MIT Prof Sontag on Casual Inference worth checking out [1]And if you like it, 2nd part is here [2][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;gRkUhg9Wb-I?si=6oMUgdjia_4g6-DR[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=g5v-NvNoJQQ reply loa_observer 2 hours agoprevWe built some causal discovery and inference features with graph visualization in Kanaries RATH: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.kanaries.net&#x2F;rath&#x2F;discover-causals&#x2F;causal-analy...It&#x27;s also open-sourced.

    "title": "Why Async Rust?",
    "originLink": "https://without.boats/blog/why-async-rust/",
    "originBody": "Without boats, dreams dry up Posts Tags Why async Rust? Oct 15, 2023 Async/await syntax in Rust was initially released to much fanfare and excitement. To quote Hacker News at the time: This is going to open the flood gates. I am sure lot of people were just waiting for this moment for Rust adoption. I for one was definitely in this boat. Also, this has all the goodness: open-source, high quality engineering, design in open, large contributors to a complex piece of software. Truly inspiring! Recently, the reception has been a bit more mixed. To a quote a comment on Hacker News again, discussing a recent blog post on the subject: I genuinely can’t understand how anybody could look at the mess that’s Rust’s async and think that it was a good design for a language that already had the reputation of being very complicated to write. I tried to get it, I really did, but my god what a massive mess that is. And it contaminates everything it touches, too. I really love Rust and I do most of my coding in it these days, but every time I encounter async-heavy Rust code my jaw clenches and my vision blurs. Of course, neither of these comments are completely representative: even four years ago, some people had pointed concerns. And in the same thread as this comment about jaws clenching and vision blurring, there were many people defending async Rust with equal fervor. But I don’t think I would be out of pocket to say that the nay-sayers have grown more numerous and their tone more strident as time has gone on. To some extent this is just the natural progression of the hype cycle, but I also think as we have become more distant from the original design process, some of the context has been lost. Between 2017 and 2019, I drove the design of async/await syntax, in collaboration with others and building on the work of those who came before me. Forgive me if I am put a bit off when someone says that they don’t know how anyone could look at that “mess” and “think that it was a good design,” and please indulge me in this imperfectly organized and overly long explanation of how async Rust came to exist, what its purpose was, and why, in my opinion, for Rust there was no viable alternative. I hope that along the way I might shed more light on the design of Rust in a broader and deeper sense, at least slightly, and not merely regurgitate the justifications of the past. Some background on terminology The basic issue at stake in this debate is Rust’s decision to use a “stackless coroutine” approach to implementing user-space concurrency. A lot of terms are thrown around in this discussion and its reasonable not to be familiar with all of them. The first concept we need to get straight is the very purpose of the feature: “user-space concurrency.” The major operating systems present a set of fairly similar interfaces to achieve concurrency: you can spawn threads, and perform IO on those threads using syscalls, which block that thread until they complete. The problem with these interfaces is that they involve certain overheads that can become a limiting factor when you want to achieve certain performance targets. These are two-fold: Context-switching between the kernel and userspace is expensive in terms of CPU cycles. OS threads have a large pre-allocated stack, which increases per-thread memory overhead. These limitations are fine up to a certain point, but for massively concurrent programs they do not work. The solution is to use a non-blocking IO interface and schedule many concurrent operations on a single OS thread. This can be done by the programmer “by hand,” but modern languages frequently provide facilities to make this easier. Abstractly, languages have some way of dividing work into tasks and scheduling those tasks onto threads. Rust’s system for this is async/await. The first axis of choice in this design space is between cooperative and preemptive scheduling. Must tasks “cooperatively” yield control back to the scheduling subsystem, or can they be “preemptively” stopped at some point while they’re running, without the task being aware of it? A term that gets thrown around a lot in these discussions is coroutine, and it is used in somewhat contradictory ways. A coroutine is a function which can be paused and then later resumed. The big ambiguity is that some people use the term “coroutine” to mean a function which has explicit syntax for pausing and resuming it (this would correspond to a cooperatively scheduled task) and some people use it to mean any function that can pause, even if the pause is performed implicitly by a language runtime (this would also include a preemptively scheduled task). I prefer the first definition, because it introduces some manner of meaningful distinction. Goroutines, on the other hand, are a Go language feature which enables concurrent, preemptively scheduled tasks. They have an API that is the same as a thread, but it is implemented as part of the language instead of as an operating system primitive, and in other languages they are often called virtual threads or else green threads. So by my definition, goroutines are not coroutines, but other people use the broader definition and say goroutines are a kind of coroutine. I’ll refer to this approach as green threads, because that’s been the terminology used in Rust. The second axis of choice is between a stackful and a stackless coroutine. A stackful coroutine has a program stack in the same way that an OS thread has a program stack: as functions are called as part of the coroutine, their frames are pushed on the stack; when the coroutine yields, the state of the stack is saved so that it can be resumed from the same position. A stackless coroutine on the other hand stores the state it needs to resume in a different way, such as in a continuation or in a state machine. When it yields, the stack it was using is used by the operation that took over from it, and when it resumes it takes back control of the stack and that continuation or state machine is used to resume the coroutine where it left off. One issue that is often brought up with async/await (in Rust and other languages) is the “function coloring problem” - a complaint that in order to get the result of an async function, you need to use a different operation (such as awaiting it) rather than call it normally. Both green threads and stackful coroutine mechanisms can avoid this outcome, because it’s that special syntax that is used to indicate that something special is happening to manage the stackless state of the coroutine (what specifically depends on the language). Rust’s async/await syntax is an example of a stackless coroutine mechanism: an async function is compiled to a function which returns a Future, and that future is what is used to store the state of the coroutine when it yields control. The basic question at hand in this debate is whether Rust was correct to adopt this approach, or if it should have adopted a more Go-like “stackful” or “green thread” approach, ideally without explicit syntax that “colors” functions. The development of async Rust Green threads A third Hacker News comment represents well the kind of remark that I often see in this debate: The alternative concurrency model people want is structured concurrency via stackful coroutines and channels on top of a work stealing executor. Until someone does the work to demo that and compare it to async/await with futures I don’t think there’s any productive discussion to be had. Setting aside the references to structured concurrency, channels and a work stealing executor (completely orthogonal concerns), the bewildering thing about comments like this is that originally Rust did have a stackful coroutine mechanism, in the form of green threads. It was removed in late 2014, shortly before the 1.0 release. Understanding the reason why will help us get to the bottom of why Rust shipped async/await syntax. A big issue for any green threading system - Rust’s or Go’s or any other language’s - is what to do about the program stack for these threads. Remember that one of the goals of a user-space concurrency mechanism is to reduce the memory overhead of the large, pre-allocated stack used by OS threads. Therefore, green thread libraries tend to try to adopt a mechanism to spawn threads with smaller stacks, and grow them only as needed. One way to achieve this is so-called “segmented stacks,” in which the stack is a linked list of small stack segments; when the stack grows beyond the bound of its segment, a new segment is added to the list, and when it shrinks, that segment is removed. The problem with this technique is that introduces a high variability in the cost of pushing a stack frame onto the stack. If the frame fits in the current segment, this is basically free. If it doesn’t, it requires allocating a new segment. A particularly pernicious version of this is when a function call in a hot loop requires allocating a new segment. This adds an allocation and deallocation to every iteration of that loop, having a significant impact on performance. And it is entirely opaque to users, because users don’t know how deep the stack will be when a function is called. Both Rust and Go started with segmented stacks, and then abandoned this approach for these reasons. Another approach is called “stack copying.” In this case, a stack is more like a Vec than a linked list: when the stack hits its limit, it is reallocated larger so that the limit isn’t hit. This allows stacks to start small and grow as needed, without the downsides of segmented stacks. The problem with this is that reallocating the stack means copying it, which means the stack will now be at a new location in memory. Any pointers into the stack are now invalid, and there needs to be some mechanism for updating them. Go uses stack copying, and benefits from the fact that in Go pointers into a stack can only exist in the same stack, so it just needs to scan that stack to rewrite pointers. Even this requires runtime type information which Rust doesn’t keep, but Rust also allows pointers into a stack that aren’t stored inside that stack - they could be somewhere in the heap, or in the stack of another thread. The problem of tracking these pointers is ultimately the same as the problem of garbage collection, except that instead of freeing memory it is moving it. Rust could not adopt this approach because Rust does not have a garbage collector, so in the end it could not adopt stack copying. Instead, Rust solved the problem of segmented stacks by making its green threads large, just like OS threads. But this eliminated one of the key advantages of green threads. Even in a situation like Go, which can have resizing stacks, green threads carry certain unavoidable costs when trying to integrate with libraries written in other languages. The C ABI, with its OS stack, is the shared minimum of every language. Switching code from executing on a green thread to running on the OS thread stack can be prohibitively expensive for FFI. Go just accepts this FFI cost; C# recently aborted an experiment with green threads for this reason. This was especially problematic for Rust, because Rust is designed to support use cases like embedding a Rust library into a binary written in another language, and to run on embedded systems that don’t have the clock cycles or memory to operate a virtual threading runtime. To attempt to resolve this problem, the green threading runtime was made optional, and Rust could instead be compiled to run on native threads, using blocking IO. This was designed to be a compile time decision made by the final binary. Thus, for a time, there were two varieties of Rust, one of which used blocking IO and native threads, and one of which used non-blocking IO and green threads, and all code was intended to be compatible with both varieties. This did not play out well, and green threads were removed from Rust as a result of RFC 230, which enumerated the reasons: The abstraction over green and native threads was not “zero-cost,” and resulted in unavoidable virtual calls and allocations when performing IO, which was not acceptable especially to native code. It forced native threads and green threads to support identical APIs, even when that didn’t make sense. It was not fully interoperable, because it was still possible to invoke native IO through FFI, even on a green thread. Once green threads were removed, the problem of high performance user space concurrency remained. The Future trait and later the async/await syntax were developed to resolve that problem. But to understand that path, we need to take one further step back and look at Rust’s solution to a different problem. Iterators I contend the true beginning of the journey to async Rust is to be found in an old mailing list post from 2013 by a former contributor named Daniel Micay. This post has nothing to do with async/await or futures or non-blocking IO: it was a post about iterators. Micay proposed shifting Rust to use what were called “external” iterators, and it was this shift - and its effectiveness in combination with Rust’s ownership and borrowing model - that set Rust inexorably on the course toward async/await. No one knew that at the time, obviously. Rust had always prohibited mutating state through a binding that was aliased with another variable - this edict “mutable XOR aliased” was as central to early Rust as it is today. But initially it enforced it with different mechanisms, not with lifetime analysis. At the time, references were just “argument modifiers,” similar in concept to things like the “inout” modifier from Swift. In 2012, Niko Matsakis had proposed and implemented the first version of Rust’s lifetime analysis, promoting references to real types and enabling them to be embedded into structs. Though the shift to lifetime analysis has been rightly recognized for its enormous impact in making Rust what it is today, its symbiotic interaction with external iterators, and the fundamental importance of that API to settling Rust into its current niche, has not received enough attention. Before the adoption of “external” iterators, Rust used a kind of callback based approach to define iterators, something that in modern Rust would look like this: enum ControlFlow { Break, Continue, } trait Iterator { type Item; fn iterate(self, f: impl FnMut(Self::Item) -> ControlFlow) -> ControlFlow; } Iterators defined this way call their callback on each element of the collection, unless it returns ControlFlow::Break, in which case they are meant to stop iterating. The body of a for loop was compiled to a closure that was passed to the iterator being looped over. Such iterators were much easier to write than external iterators, but there are two key problems with this approach: The language couldn’t guarantee that iteration actually stops running when the loop says to break, so you couldn’t rely on that for memory safety. This meant things like return references from a loop was not possible, because the loop could actually continue. They couldn’t be used to implement generic combinators that interleave multiple iterators, like zip, because the API doesn’t support iterating alternatively through one iterator and then another. Instead, Daniel Micay proposed to shift Rust to use “external” iterators, which completely resolve these problems and have the interface Rust users are used to today: trait Iterator { type Item; fn next(&mut self) -> Option; } (Very well-informed readers will be aware that Rust’s Iterator has an a provided method called try_fold which is functionally very similar to the internal iterator API and is used in the definition of some other iterator combinators because it can result in better code generation. But it isn’t the key underlying method by which all iterators are defined.) External iterators integrated perfectly with Rust’s ownership and borrowing system because they essentially compile to a struct which holds the state of iteration inside of itself, and which can therefore contain references to data structures being iterated over just like any other struct. And thanks to monomorphization, a complex iterator built by assembling multiple combinators also compiled into a single struct, making it transparent to the optimizer. The only problem was that they were harder to write by hand, because you need to define the state machine that will be used for iteration. Foreshadowing future developments, Daniel Micay wrote at the time: In the future, Rust can have generators using a yield statement like C#, compiling down to a fast state machine without requiring context switches, virtual functions or even closures. This would eliminate the difficulty of coding recursive traversals by-hand with external iterators. Progress on generators has not moved swiftly, though an exciting RFC was recently published that would suggest we may see this feature soon. Even without generators, external iterators proved to be a great success, and the general value of the technique was recognized. For example, Aria Beingessner used a similar approach in the “Entry API” for accessing map entries. Tellingly, in the RFC for the API, she refers to it as “iterator-like.” What she means by this is that the API builds a state machine via series of combinators, which presented itself to the compiler as highly legible and thus optimizable. This technique had legs. Futures When they needed to replace green threads, Aaron Turon and Alex Crichton began by copying the API used in many other languages, which has come to be called futures or promises. APIs like this are based on what is called a “continuation passing style.” A future defined in this way takes a callback as an additional argument, called the continuation, and calls the continuation as its final operation when the future completes. This is how this abstraction is defined in most languages, and the async/await syntax of most languages is compiled into this sort of continuation passing style. In Rust, that sort of API would have looked something like this: trait Future { type Output; fn schedule(self, continuation: impl FnOnce(Self::Output)); } Aaron Turon and Alex Crichton tried this approach, but as Aaron Turon wrote in an enlightening blog post, they quickly ran into the problem that using a continuation passing style too often required allocating the callback. Turon gives the example of join: join takes two futures, and runs them both concurrently. The continuation of join needs to be owned by both child futures, because whichever of them finishes last needs to execute it. This ended up requiring reference counting and allocations to implement, which wasn’t considered acceptable for Rust. Instead, they examined how C programmers tend to implement async programming: in C, programmers handle non blocking IO by building a state machine. What they wanted was a definition of Future that could be compiled into the sort of state machine that C programmers would write by hand. After some experimentation, they landed on what they called a “readiness-based” approach: enum Poll { Ready(T), Pending, } trait Future { type Output; fn poll(&mut self) -> Poll; } Instead of storing a continuation, a future is polled by some external executor. When a future is pending, it stores a way to wake that executor, which it will execute when it is ready to be polled again. By inverting control in this way, they no longer needed to store a callback for when a future completes, which allowed them to represent a future as a single state machine. They built a library of combinators on top of this interface, that all would be compiled into a single state machine. Switching from a callback-based approach to an external driver, compiling a set of combinators into a single state machine, even the exact specification of these two APIs: all of this should sound very familiar if you read the previous section. The shift from continuations to polling is exactly the same shift that was performed with iterators in 2013! Once again, it was Rust’s ability to handle structs with lifetimes and therefore to handle stackless coroutines which borrow state from outside themselves that allowed it to optimally represent futures as state machines without violating memory safety. This pattern of building single-object state machines out of smaller components, whether applied to iterators or futures, is a key part of how Rust works. It falls out of the language almost naturally. I’ll pause for a moment to highlight one difference between iterators and futures: combinators that interleave two iterators, like Zip, are not even possible with a callback-like approach, unless your language has some sort of native support for coroutines you’re building on top of. On the other hand, if you want to interleave two futures, like Join, the continuation based approach can support that: it just carries some runtime costs. This explains why external iterators are common in other languages, but Rust is unique in applying this transform to futures. In its initial iteration, the futures library was designed with the principle that users would construct futures in much the same way that they constructed iterators: low-level library authors would use the Future trait, whereas users writing applications would use a set of combinators, provided by the futures library, to construct more complex futures out of simpler components. Unfortunately, users immediately faced frustrating compiler errors when they tried to follow this approach. The problem was that futures, when spawned, need to “escape” the surrounding context, and therefore can’t borrow state from that context: the task most own all of its state. This was a problem for futures combinators, because often that state needs to be accessed in multiple combinators that form part of the chain of actions that make up the future. For example, it was common for users to call one “async” method on an object, and then another, which would be written like this: foo.bar().and_then(|result| foo.baz(result)) The problem was that foo was borrowed both in the bar method and then in the closure passed to and_then. Essentially, what users wanted to do was store state “across an await point,” the await point being formed by the chaining of future combinators; this usually resulted confounding and perplexing borrow-checker errors. The most accessible solution to this was to store that state in an Arc and Mutex, which is not zero-cost and more importantly was very unwieldy and awkward as your system grew in complexity. For example: let foo = Arc::new(Mutex::new(foo)); foo.clone().lock().bar() .and_then(move |result| foo.lock().baz(result)) Despite the great benchmarks that futures had shown in the initial experimentation, the result of this limitation was that users weren’t able to use them to build complex systems. This is where I came into the story. Async/await In late 2017, it was clear that the futures ecosystem was failing to launch for reasons of bad user experience. It was always the end goal of the futures project to implement a so-called “stackless coroutine transform,” in which functions using async and await syntax operators could be transformed into functions that evaluate to futures, avoiding users having to write futures by hand. Alex Crichton had developed a macro based async/await implementation as a library, but this had gained almost no traction. Something needed to change. One of the biggest problems with Alex Crichton’s macros was that it would produce an error if a user attempted to have a reference to future state that was held over an await point. This was really the same issue as the borrowing issue users encountered with futures combinators, appearing again in the new syntax. It was not possible for a future to hold a reference to its own state while awaiting, because this would need to be compiled into a self-referential struct, which Rust had no support for. It’s interesting to compare this to the problem of green threads. One way we’ve explained the compilation of futures to state machines is to say that the state machine is a “perfectly sized stack” - unlike the stack of a green thread, which must grow to accommodate the state of the unknown sized that any thread stack may have, a compiled future (implemented by hand, with combinators, or with an async function) is exactly as large as it needs to be. So we don’t have the problem of growing this stack at runtime. However, this stack is represented as a struct, and it is always safe to move structs in Rust. This means that even though we don’t need to move a future around while it’s being executed, according to the rules of Rust we need to be able to. Thus, the problem of stack pointers that we encountered with green threads re-emerged in the new system. This time, though, we had the advantage that we didn’t need to be able to move the future, we just needed to express that the future was immovable. The initial attempt to implement this was to try to define a new trait, called Move, which would be used to exclude coroutines from APIs which can move them. This ran into some backwards compatibility problems that I have previously documented. My thesis for async/await had three main points: We needed async/await syntax in the language so that users could build complex futures using coroutine-like functions. Async/await syntax needed to support compiling those functions to self-referential structs, so that users could use references in coroutines. This feature needed to ship as soon as humanly possible. The combination of these three points led me to search for an alternative solution to the Move trait, one that could be implemented without any major disruptive change to the language. My initial plan to achieve this result was much worse than what we ended up with. I proposed that we would just make the poll method unsafe, and include as an invariant that once you have started polling a future, you cannot move it again. This was simple, immediately implementable, and extremely brute force: it would have made every hand-written future unsafe, and imposed a difficult to verify requirement with no assistance from the compiler. It likely would have ran aground on some soundness issue eventually, and it would certainly have been extremely controversial. So it was wonderful that Eddy Burtescu made a few remarks that led me in the direction of a much better API, which would enable us to enforce the invariants required in a much more fine-grained way. This would eventually become the Pin type. The Pin type itself has been the source of a fair amount of consternation, but I think it was an undeniable improvement on the other options were were considering at the time, in that it was targeted, enforceable, and also shippable on time. In retrospect, there are two categories of problems with the pinning approach: Backward compatibility: some interfaces that already existed (especially Iterator and Drop) should have supported immovable types for various reasons, and this has limited the options in developing the language further. Exposure to end users: our intention was that users writing “normal async Rust” would never have to deal with Pin. Mostly this has been true, but there are a few notable exceptions. Almost all of these would be fix-able with some syntax improvements. The only one that’s really bad (and embarrassing to me personally) is that you need to pin a future trait object to await it. This was an unforced error that would now be a breaking change to fix. The only other decisions to be made about async/await were syntactic, which I will not unsettle in this already overly long post. Organizational considerations My reason in exploring all this history is to demonstrate that a series of facts about Rust led us inevitably into a specific design space. The first was that Rust’s lack of runtime made green threads a non-viable solution, both because Rust needs to support embedding (both embedding into other applications and running on embedded systems) and because Rust cannot perform the memory management necessary for green threads. The second was that Rust has a natural capacity for expressing coroutines compiled to highly optimizable state machines while still being memory safe, which we exploit not only for futures but also for iterators. But there is another side to this history: why did we pursue a runtime system for user-space concurrency? Why have futures and async/await at all? This argument usually takes one of two forms: on the one hand, you have people who are used to managing user-space concurrency “by hand,” using an interface like epoll directly; these people sometimes sneer at async/await syntax as “webcrap.” On the other hand, some people just say “you aren’t gonna need it,” and propose using simpler OS concurrency like threads and blocking IO. People implementing highly performant network services in languages without facilities for user-space concurrency like C tend to implement them using a hand-written state machine. This is exactly what the Future abstraction was designed to compile into, but without having to write the state machine by hand: the whole point of the coroutine transform to write imperative code “as if your function never yields,” but have the compiler generate the state transitions to suspend it when it would block. The benefits of this are not insignificant. A recent curl CVE was ultimately caused by a failure to recognize state that needed to be saved during a state transition. This kind of logic error is easy to make when implementing a state machine by hand. The goal of shipping async/await syntax in Rust was to ship a feature which avoided those bugs while still having the same performance profile. Systems like this, most often written in C or C++, were considered well within our addressable audience, given the level of control we provide and the lack of memory management runtime. In early 2018, the Rust project had committed to the idea of releasing a new “edition” that year, to fix some of the syntactic issues that had emerged with 1.0. It was also decided to use this edition as an opportunity to promote a narrative around Rust being ready for prime-time; the Mozilla team was mostly compiler hackers and type theorists, but we had some basic idea about marketing and recognized the edition as an opportunity to get eyeballs on the product. I proposed to Aaron Turon that we should focus on four basic user stories which seemed like growth opportunities for Rust. These were: Embedded systems WebAssembly Command-line interfaces Network services This remark was the jumping off point for the creation of the “Domain Working Groups”, which were intended to be cross-functional groups focused on a particular use “domains” (in contrast to the pre-existing “teams” controlling some technical or organizational bailiwick). The concept of working groups in the Rust project has morphed since then and mostly lost this sense, but I digress. The work on async/await was pioneered by the “network services” working group, which eventually become known as simply the async working group (and still exists under this name today). However, we were also acutely aware that given its lack of runtime dependencies, async Rust could also be of great service in the other domains, especially embedded systems. We designed the feature with both of these use cases in mind. It was clear, though usually left unsaid, that what Rust needed to succeed was industry adoption, so that it could continue to receive support once Mozilla stopped being willing to fund an experimental new language. And it was clear that the most likely path to short-term industry adoption was in network services, especially those with a performance profile that compelled them at the time to be written in C/C++. This use case fit the niche of Rust perfectly - these systems need high degrees of control to achieve their performance requirements but avoiding exploitable memory bugs is critical because they are exposed to the network. The other advantage of network services was that this wing of the software industry has the flexibility and appetite to rapidly adopt a new technology like Rust. The other domains were - and are! - viable long term opportunities for Rust, but they were seen as not as quick to adopt new technology (embedded), depended on a new platform that had not yet seen widespread adoption itself (WebAssembly), or were not a particularly lucrative industrial application that could lead to funding for the language (CLIs). I drove at async/await with the diligent fervor of the assumption that Rust’s survival depended on this feature. In that regard, async/await has been phenomenally successful. Many of the most prominent sponsors of the Rust Foundation, especially those who pay developers, depend on async/await to write high performance network services in Rust as one of their primary use cases that justify their funding. Using async/await for embedded systems or kernel programming is also a growing area of interest with a bright future. Async/await has been so successful that the most common complaint about it is that the ecosystem is too centered on it, rather than “normal” Rust. I don’t know what to tell users who would rather just use threads and blocking IO. Certainly, I think there are a lot of systems for which that is a reasonable approach. And nothing in the Rust language prevents them from doing it. Their objection seems to be that the ecosystem on crates.io, especially for writing network services, is centered on using async/await. Ocassionally, I see a library which uses async/await in a “cargo cult” way, but mostly it seems safe to assume that the author of the library actually wants to perform non-blocking IO and get the performance benefits of user-space concurrency. None of us can control what everyone else decides to work on, and the fact of the matter is just that most people who release networking-related libraries on crates.io want to use async Rust, whether for business reasons or just out of interest. I’d like it to be easier to use those libraries in a non-async context (e.g. by bringing a pollster-like API into the standard library), but it’s hard to know what to say to people who’s gripe is that the people putting code online for free don’t have exactly the same use case as them. To be continued Although I contend there was no alternative for Rust, I don’t believe async/await is the right alternative to any language. In particular, I think there is a possibility for a language which provides the same sort of reliability guarantees that Rust provides, but less control over the runtime representation of values, which uses stackful coroutines instead of stackless ones. I even think - if such a language supported such coroutines in such a way that they could be used for both iteration and concurrency - that language could do without lifetimes entirely while still eliminating errors that arise from aliased mutability. If you read his notes, you can see that this language is what Graydon Hoare was originally driving at, before Rust changed course to be a systems language that could complete with C and C++. I think there are users of Rust who would be perfectly happy using this language if it existed, and I understand why they dislike that they have to deal with inherent complexity of the low level details. It be that these users complained about the myriad string types, now they are more likely to complain about async. I wish that a language for this use case with the same kinds of guarantees as Rust also existed, but the problem here isn’t with Rust. And despite the fact that I believe async/await is the right approach for Rust, I also think its reasonable to be unhappy with the state of async ecosystem today. We shipped an MVP in 2019, tokio shipped a 1.0 in 2020, and things have been more stagnant since then than I think anyone involved would like. In a follow up post, I want to discuss the state of the async ecosystem today, and what I think the project could do to improve users’ experience.

In Rust, Future.poll() is not blocking, and one would need to rely on some async framework, or build own event loop which can potentially block thread. reply tux3 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s worth noting that a thread&#x27;s JoinHandle provides a similar interface.You can spawn your tasks, store the JoinHandle \"futures\", and wait for completion whenever you need the result.A difference being that Futures do nothing until polled, while threads start on their own, but that&#x27;s arguably a helpful simplification for this purpose. reply convolvatron 13 hours agorootparentthis I really found disconcerting - the model I often want is I want to start some work, and then join at some later point - or even chain directly into the next task.but instead I start a future, and then to run it at all I need to wait for the result.

Tasks are independent entities like Promises which are being run by the executor, though they may currently be blocked on other tasks.> the model I often want is I want to start some work, and then join at some later point - or even chain directly into the next task.Rust wants you to do this the other way around. First chain together your futures so that when you start the top level one as a task there is a single state machine for it to run. replytwic 14 hours agoprev> I don’t know what to tell users who would rather just use threads and blocking IO. Certainly, I think there are a lot of systems for which that is a reasonable approach. And nothing in the Rust language prevents them from doing it. Their objection seems to be that the ecosystem on crates.io, especially for writing network services, is centered on using async&#x2F;await. Ocassionally, I see a library which uses async&#x2F;await in a “cargo cult” way, but mostly it seems safe to assume that the author of the library actually wants to perform non-blocking IO and get the performance benefits of user-space concurrency.This seems like a glib dismissal of a real problem. If you want to do threads-and-blocking programming in the large in Rust, you basically can&#x27;t, because async has become a very strong default in the ecosystem. And i don&#x27;t think anyone could look at the ecosystem and honestly form the opinion that it&#x27;s that way because every library developer has made the informed decision that their use-case requires async, when use cases which require async are so incredibly rare - it is absolutely a social default.> None of us can control what everyone else decides to work on, and the fact of the matter is just that most people who release networking-related libraries on crates.io want to use async Rust, whether for business reasons or just out of interest. I’d like it to be easier to use those libraries in a non-async context (e.g. by bringing a pollster-like API into the standard library), but it’s hard to know what to say to people who’s gripe is that the people putting code online for free don’t have exactly the same use case as them.The criticism is not about the library authors, but about the stewards of the language and community who laid the path for them to follow. reply galangalalgol 13 hours agoparentOk, I feel a bit dense here, but I have an application that has threads and blocking.

It has been noted multiple times in the comments here that at this point, one should just use tokio as the async runtime. (From my limited experience, I agree)The async Rust book [0] says this about runtimes:> Importantly, executors, tasks, reactors, combinators, and low-level I&#x2F;O futures and traits are not yet provided in the standard library. In the meantime, community-provided async ecosystems fill in these gaps.Notably, it says \"not yet\".

Also, is tokio in the talks to be the runtime, or is this still open?[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rust-lang.github.io&#x2F;async-book&#x2F;08_ecosystem&#x2F;00_chapt... reply afdbcreid 12 hours agoparentThere are no plans to incorporate a big async runtime like tokio.

Mainly for tests or examples. No timeline though, at least as far as I&#x27;m aware.There are also plans to standardize the async traits, e.g. spawn a new task, AsyncRead and AsyncWrite etc..

(Yes that would take a long time to arrive.) reply spease 14 hours agoparentI’m pretty sure that modern CPUs do generally have shadow registers to make context switching faster. However, you also have to consider cache contention, the fact it needs to access an indefinite amount of machine code during the context switch, it may service other processes during the context switch, and the effects all this will have on the instruction pipeline. Not to mention bugs in the CPU that might require it to flush the pipeline to maintain complete process separation.So you can keep dedicating more and more silicon to redundant components to get closer to physically representing each thread, or you can code more efficiently.Eg even if you did nothing but loop over a do-nothing system call, it would still need to have two separate executable pages in the cache instead of just one.Not only that, but often the kernel is acting as a mediator for the hardware - which could mean synchronizing between cores, which brings its own obstacles (using slower shared cache, waiting for other cores, etc) reply duped 14 hours agoparentprevOne problem is that when the stack is allocated it goes into the rest of the same virtual address space, and \"growing\" it might result in overlapping other address space allocated to the rest of the program. That&#x27;s why there are guard pages around the stack (also, worth knowing that the stack doesn&#x27;t grow up on some architectures, it can also grow down like on x86). That&#x27;s why the post points out that growable stacks have to be moveable.The main solution is to just reserve a ton of virtual address space but avoid committing to it until the process actually writes to it, which is exactly what OS threads do. They reserve a large amount of virtual address space to start but it&#x27;s more or less free until a thread actually uses it. However you may not see it released back to the OS until the process exits. reply IshKebab 13 hours agorootparentYeah maybe an issue on 32-bit, but on 64-bit virtual address space is basically unlimited. reply duped 12 hours agorootparentThe problem isn&#x27;t the amount of virtual address space but guaranteeing that when you grow you don&#x27;t hit anything else.

Looks like they reduced the costs by ~20x. I wonder why it was never merged.I guess my intuition was right then.

And it was clear that the most likely path to short-term industry adoption was in network services, especially those with a performance profile that compelled them at the time to be written in C&#x2F;C++ ...The other advantage of network services was that this wing of the software industry has the flexibility and appetite to rapidly adopt a new technology like Rust. The other domains were - and are! - viable long term opportunities for Rust, but they were seen as not as quick to adopt new technology (embedded), depended on a new platform that had not yet seen widespread adoption itself (WebAssembly), or were not a particularly lucrative industrial application that could lead to funding for the language (CLIs). I drove at async&#x2F;await with the diligent fervor of the assumption that Rust’s survival depended on this feature.... Many of the most prominent sponsors of the Rust Foundation, especially those who pay developers, depend on async&#x2F;await to write high performance network services in Rust as one of their primary use cases that justify their funding. Using async&#x2F;await for embedded systems or kernel programming is also a growing area of interest with a bright future. Async&#x2F;await has been so successful that the most common complaint about it is that the ecosystem is too centered on it, rather than “normal” Rust.I don’t know what to tell users who would rather just use threads and blocking IO. Certainly, I think there are a lot of systems for which that is a reasonable approach. And nothing in the Rust language prevents them from doing it. Their objection seems to be that the ecosystem on crates.io, especially for writing network services, is centered on using async&#x2F;await. ...None of us can control what everyone else decides to work on, and the fact of the matter is just that most people who release networking-related libraries on crates.io want to use async Rust, whether for business reasons or just out of interest. I’d like it to be easier to use those libraries in a non-async context (e.g. by bringing a pollster-like API into the standard library), but it’s hard to know what to say to people who’s gripe is that the people putting code online for free don’t have exactly the same use case as them.Well, that says it. Rust has pivoted to web stuff. For which Go is probably better suited. Good-bye, Rust as a systems language, or for game development. Younger programmers will probably still be seeing C&#x2F;C++ buffer overflows in 2050.The technical problem is that pure async, like JavaScript, is fine, and pure threading, like classic Rust, is fine. But the combination is awful. reply steveklabnik 15 hours agoparentThis blog post goes into detail about how technical decisions were made to keep Rust a \"systems language.\" Rust&#x27;s async&#x2F;await is even moreso here than C++ coroutines, as Rust requires zero allocations and C++ coroutines require at least one (that hopefully could be optimized out but that&#x27;s not a guarantee.) People use async&#x2F;await in embedded contexts, with no or tiny heaps, thanks to this careful design. It doesn&#x27;t get more \"systems\" than that.The end of the post specifically lays out a space for a \"less systems Rust\" that would make these features nicer, but that cannot exist in Rust due to its strong commitment to being as zero-overhead as possible.I don&#x27;t know what it is about this feature that leads to everyone grandstanding all the time. It&#x27;s incredibly frustrating. reply alilleybrinker 14 hours agorootparentAgreed on the grandstanding! I can’t think of another topic area where the option space is extremely rich and full of trade-offs and the discussion space is so full of strong claims of there being one obvious and unquestionably best solution. reply corethree 14 hours agorootparentprevThe community needs a language that isn&#x27;t so extreme that is opinionated on what is zero cost and what is not. Golang sort of fits this bill as it has an opinionated take on this, but overall from my pov it&#x27;s a bad opinion. No sum types, no namespaces, garbage collection.... I feel it&#x27;s still the only other language that fills this space that isn&#x27;t so OOP. It&#x27;s a bad solution and it&#x27;s popular because it&#x27;s the only solution.Anyway to get back to your point, I think this is why so many people complain. It&#x27;s either go or rust and neither is ideal so one way to deal with the problem is attempting to shape rust into this ideal.Right? Where can I find a language with no garbage collection, nice sum types and no over complicated async syntax? Where? Nowhere. This is what people want. reply Rusky 14 hours agorootparentYou can just not write async code in Rust, no? There are a lot of Rust programmers that work this way, and it&#x27;s fine because async is quite separable from the rest of the language.Even if you have to pull in a dependency that uses async (though if you are not doing async stuff yourself, why would you??) you can trivially wrap it up with `block_on` and move on with your life. reply corethree 11 hours agorootparentI could. But I could also write the whole thing in assembly or go. I want a language that does everything I want and that includes a clean async api. I think there&#x27;s a hole here because what \"I\" described as what \"I\" want is what a lot of people want. reply ReleaseCandidat 14 hours agorootparentprev> Where can I find a language with no garbage collection, nice sum types and no over complicated async syntax?Austral: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borretti.me&#x2F;article&#x2F;introducing-austral It doesn&#x27;t have complicated async syntax, because it doesn&#x27;t have it at all :) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;borretti.me&#x2F;article&#x2F;introducing-austral#fn:async reply corethree 11 hours agorootparentI should add: that is also popular and easy to find a job for.

Probably not. reply withoutboats3 15 hours agoparentprevThis is a completely ridiculous mischaracterization of what I wrote, John, and you of all people should understand that sometimes systems programming and network programming are the same goddamn thing. I can tell you that there are plenty of systems written in async Rust that you have probably interacted within the past 4 years and that they would otherwise have been written in C or C++. That&#x27;s what async Rust was designed for - not \"web stuff.\" reply nemothekid 15 hours agoparentprev>Well, that says it. Rust has pivoted to web stuff. For which Go is probably better suited.I think the focus should be entirely on this line:>The other domains were - and are! - viable long term opportunities for Rust, but they were seen as not as quick to adopt new technology (embedded), depended on a new platform that had not yet seen widespread adoption itself (WebAssembly), or were not a particularly lucrative industrial application that could lead to funding for the language (CLIs)The problem is \"web stuff\" was the only domain that could realistically fund the development of Rust. This is further supported by Mozilla dropping the Rust project with all it&#x27;s funding issues and the slack being largely picked up by companies like Amazon.The systems&#x2F;game languages are still possible, but if the Rust team hadn&#x27;t focused on serving the needs of an industry that could ensure it&#x27;s longevity, there might not be any Rust today to say \"Good-bye\" to.And I think that&#x27;s fair. It&#x27;s unreasonable to expect a project to prioritize your needs when you are unable or unwilling to fund the project. The is also true of the &#x27;crates.io&#x27; async problem - the companies that are ready to adopt Rust and pay developers to write Rust are companies in which async networking is a big deal. If there are other libraries that need to exist in any other domain, well someone needs to be paid to write them and it doesn&#x27;t look like there are very many entities that exist to take up that challenge. reply ReactiveJelly 15 hours agoparentprev> Well, that says it.It does not say that though.

Rust has pivoted to web stuff.Rust is just a language - and it&#x27;s just as suitable to deep embedded and general system programming as it&#x27;s ever been.

Oh my god, I disagree so much.We&#x27;re using Rust in production in our microservices stack (Actix), and we&#x27;re developing animation systems in Bevy.The only places we use other languages are Python for pytorch and Typescript for rapid UI development. We do have a bit of Rust &#x2F; WASM &#x2F; Typescript interplay though.Rust is turning into a truly full stack, cross-domain, cross-dicipline language. And that&#x27;s powerful. It&#x27;s something Python had going for it (scripting, web, numerical, etc.) when it got picked up for its massive adoption. Rust could totally replicate this.Rust rocks.

    "originBody": "Install Documentation Contribute Blog Search The easy-to-use, integrated, glanceable, and open web-based interface for your servers Released 5 Oct 2023: Version 302 Introducing Cockpit Cockpit is a web-based graphical interface for servers, intended for everyone, especially those who are: new to Linux (including Windows admins) familiar with Linux and want an easy, graphical way to administer servers expert admins who mainly use other tools but want an overview on individual systems Thanks to Cockpit intentionally using system APIs and commands, a whole team of admins can manage a system in the way they prefer, including the command line and utilities right alongside Cockpit. Take a look A picture is worth a thousand words. Click a thumbnail to see screenshots of Cockpit in action. Simple to use Cockpit makes Linux discoverable. You don’t have to remember commands at a command-line. See your server in a web browser and perform system tasks with a mouse. It’s easy to start containers, administer storage, configure networks, and inspect logs. Basically, you can think of Cockpit like a graphical “desktop interface”, but for individual servers. Compatible with your existing workflows Have a favorite app or command line tool that you use on your servers? Keep using the command line, Ansible, and your other favorite tools and add Cockpit to the mix with no issues. Cockpit uses the same system tooling you would use from the command line. You can switch back and forth between Cockpit and whatever else you like. Cockpit even has a built-in terminal, which is useful when you connect from a non-Linux device. Integrated Cockpit uses APIs that already exist on the system. It doesn’t reinvent subsystems or add a layer of its own tooling. By default, Cockpit uses your system’s normal user logins and privileges. Network-wide logins are also supported through single-sign-on and other authentication techniques. Cockpit itself doesn’t eat resources or even run in the background when you’re not using it. It runs on demand, thanks to systemd socket activation. Extendable Cockpit also supports a large list of optional and third-party applications. Using Cockpit Here’s a subset of tasks you can perform on each host running Cockpit: Inspect and change network settings Configure a firewall Manage storage (including RAID and LUKS partitions) Create and manage virtual machines Download and run containers Browse and search system logs Inspect a system’s hardware Upgrade software Keep tabs on performance Manage user accounts Inspect and interact with systemd-based services Use a terminal on a remote server in your local web browser Switch between multiple Cockpit servers Extend Cockpit’s functionality by installing a growing list of apps and add-ons Write your own custom modules to make Cockpit do anything you want Also troubleshoot and fix pesky problems with ease: Diagnose network issues Spot and react to misbehaving virtual machines Examine SELinux logs and fix common violations in a click Inspect detailed metrics that correlate CPU load, memory usage, network activity, and storage performance with the system’s journal More features appear in Cockpit every release. Designed & tested Cockpit’s design keeps your goals in mind. We test Cockpit with usability studies to make it work the way you’d expect and adjust accordingly. As a result, Cockpit gets easier to use all the time. All code changes have tests which must pass before merging, to ensure stability. Free & free Cockpit is free to use and available under the GNU LGPL. Cockpit works (nearly) everywhere You can install Cockpit on the major distributions, including: Once Cockpit is up and running, you can access systems from all major web browsers on any operating system (including Windows, MacOS, and Android). Release schedule Cockpit has a time-based release cadence, with new versions appearing every two weeks. Get started After installing and enabling Cockpit, visit port 9090 on your server (for example: https://localhost:9090/ in a browser on the same machine as Cockpit).

This thread has to be some big Red Hatter click farm or something. The artificial positivity is striking. Is Red Hat threatening to pull funding for this project or something? Just weird.Cockpit is okay but it&#x27;s basically Red Hat&#x27;s equivalent to the Windows Server Manager tool, and I have no doubt it was directly inspired by Server Manager. It&#x27;s development and improvement over the years has been painfully slow.Nobody who is comfortable with an ssh session uses Cockpit, except maybe to create new VMs, and even then all of these comments comparing it to Proxmox are just whack because it doesn&#x27;t have a quarter of the features the Proxmox UI offers. The utility for managing VMs is a recent development and even then I still prefer the Virtual Machine Manager tool because I don&#x27;t want to deal with the latency increase and other limitations of working through a browser.But anyway, there&#x27;s a ton of things you can&#x27;t do with Cockpit, and never will be able to do. It&#x27;s for people who want to point and click, can&#x27;t do a bash for&#x2F;while loop, don&#x27;t understand pipe chaining commands, and don&#x27;t like using vim.Like happyweasel said, it&#x27;s basically webmin for Red Hat.It&#x27;s kinda cool, but it&#x27;s so old now and development has been so slow and it&#x27;s been so over-hyped that I don&#x27;t pay attention to it at all and I&#x27;ve never used it except what was required to get certified. reply Kiro 1 hour agoparent> Please don&#x27;t post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling, brigading, foreign agents, and the like.

Are you ready to deploy an ssh-capable terminal emulator at all times? What&#x27;s wrong with making simple tasks simple?I run multiple Raspberry Pi cameras (with nicer camera modules) to watch the pets if the family travels. The RTSP camera streams run in a systemd unit on their boxes. I have some healthchecks to make sure packets are being streamed as other systemd units. Each camera gets its own private IP on a ZeroTier network I manage. Since copilot is only run on demand, it&#x27;s a no brainer to have around for administration.Sometimes one of the cameras just starts streaming out blank frames. I&#x27;d much rather manage this through a copilot web interface on my phone when I&#x27;m on vacation than find a keyboard to use SSH with and restart the camera stream unit. I mean sure, I could write a healthcheck which checks whether blank frames are being emitted, but it&#x27;s just so much easier to restart it via copilot than it is to write that healthcheck and it only ever happens a few times a year.

What a beautiful design. reply arghwhat 1 hour agoparentTo be fair, we&#x27;ve had this since BSD4.3 (1986) through inetd - which worked slightly differently, but same overall idea. Once popular, it fell out of fashion because... Well, there isn&#x27;t really any reason for it.A good server process is idle when nothing is happening, and should be using miniscule real memory that should be easy to swap out. If the server in question uses significant memory for your use-case, you also don&#x27;t want it starting on demand and triggering sporadic memory pressure.It does make it easier to avoid blocking on service start in early boot though, which is a common cause of poor boot performance. reply tanelpoder 2 hours agoparentprevI ended up reading more about this and looks like SSHD in Ubuntu 22.10 and later also uses systemd socket activation.

Cockpit is essentialy a wrapper over systemd commands, and one commentor has demonstrated how it could have been envisioned as a modular platform allowing end-users to wrap anything from direct kernel interfaces to entirely custom commands. They&#x27;ve made something useful and beautiful, but I wish it had been designed to make less assumption about it&#x27;s runtime environment and expose it&#x27;s toolkit to end-users so that we could all enjoy it for our own needs. reply gbraad 4 hours agoparentprevIt can be hosted without Systemd:sudo runuser -u cockpit-wsinstance -- &#x2F;usr&#x2F;libexec&#x2F;cockpit-ws --port=9090 --for-tls-proxy reply LanternLight83 9 minutes agorootparentThanks! Funnily enough, I don&#x27;t think this matches the approach I tried from some GH issue back in the day :pAnd of course, we&#x27;d still need to reimplement many of the existing systemd-based modules. I wonder if the creation and maintenance of these modules (given the existing size and status of the ecosystem) is less-than-trivial in comparison to something like a set of NixOS config bindings. At the end of the day, I&#x27;d be more exited about a project that puts portability and customization first than retrofitting an upstream product to whom I&#x27;m not a target user. reply xenator 5 hours agoparentprevWhy you don&#x27;t use systemd? Anything against it? reply LanternLight83 45 minutes agorootparentThanks for asking! I&#x27;ve always used the \"default\" init system when trying a new distro, and while I enjoyed running systemd on Fedora, I&#x27;ve also enjoyed working with OpenRC on Gentoo and with Shepherd on GNU Guix. I&#x27;ve tinkered a lot with early boot, writing my own initrds, curating system services under each of these init&#x27;s.systemd is undeniably powerful, but I enjoy how broad the ecosystem is.

I am Italian, worked abroad for ~15 years in English speaking countries and companies, and I&#x27;ve always been frustrated by my inability to convey some of the greatest poems of Italian literature to my English-speaking friends.This project of yours is brilliant.Small pieces of feedback I have:- allow for a quicker way to change playback speed - instead of clicking the \"points\", and then \"playback speed\", and then change the speed, make 3-4 instant buttons available (0,5x, 0,75x, 1x, 1,5x).- if there&#x27;s a youtube video of the specific poem being narrated by people like Gassman, Proietti, etc, a video added at the bottom of the page might be great. e.g. Gassman legge Pavese: \"Verrà la morte e avrà i tuoi occhi\" [0][0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ny3qXRIC9YQ&list=PLfk7A2f8wT... reply ItalianPoetry 20 hours agoparentThank for the suggestions!My voice is terrible, so I&#x27;ll definitely follow your latter point.I hadn&#x27;t even thought about playback speed, especially since those are all pretty quick, but I&#x27;ll think about it for sure. reply izietto 19 hours agorootparentYour voice is not terrible, I enjoyed it quit a lot. By the way kudos to you, I&#x27;m Italian and that was interesting for me too! I&#x27;d love to have it in other languages too. Oh, and also I love the website vibes! The right mix between 2000 websites and contemporary elegance! reply ItalianPoetry 19 hours agorootparentI was actually thinking of doing the same for Latin...Now the infrastructure is built, so the effort should be much smaller (but I&#x27;d need of course much more support from an expert ^^ ).Do you think it might have an audience? reply izietto 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love to have it in languages that I don&#x27;t speak with a deep poetry history, like Japanese, Indian, Persian, languages from Africa... but I guess the biggest problem there is not the infrastructure, is knowing the language.But also Latin would be interesting, Latin has tons of great poems, even funny ones (I still remember Marziale :D ) reply artzmeister 8 hours agorootparentprevDude, yes! I was reading this and thinking \"if only there was one for Latin...\"!There is a big Latin & Ancient Greek server on Discord, and the people over there would love your project for sure. Lots of them being Italians, it would be even better. Since you&#x27;re wondering about the help of experts, there would be no better place to go to than there.I dream of a unified platform for the classics - translation, archive of books, and so on... equidem adjuvabo si quidam tamen capiat umquam consilium. Vale! reply ItalianPoetry 4 hours agorootparentGreek is sadly out of my reach, but I&#x27;m very curious about this Discord you mentioned.Could you, here or by email, point it out to me? After this website has \"settled\" a bit, it might be fun to look into that Latin :) replyQwuke 16 hours agoprevI love the design of the site and it&#x27;s really a dream for reading translated poetry! I enjoy reading a handful of Italian poets (and translated poetry in general), and a website like this for German, Polish, etc poetry would be lovely. Would you ever think of open sourcing this for others to attempt this for their own languages?I&#x27;d really love to see a couple poems from the notoriously hard to translate Giacomo Leopardi - they are quite beautiful, and hearing them in Italian is a treat! reply ItalianPoetry 15 hours agoparentThanks!Yes, I was thinking of cleaning up the repo and make it public in a while, though honestly it&#x27;s not too pretty ^^And yes, Leopardi is coming: I have Il Sabato del villaggio almost ready to go :) reply mordechai9000 13 hours agorootparentSo I&#x27;ve studied German a little. I have no conversational skills and little facility reading it. But I really enjoy German poetry in the original language. My theory is that it&#x27;s like the Guitar Hero version of speaking the language - it lets me play along with an expert, even though I am a rank neophyte. I would love to see this in German.One thing that bothers me is that the cultural context is lost. I am completely oblivious to things that would be obvious to a native speaker. For instance, I like some poems by Christian Morgenstern, but is that like saying I like a Hallmark card or a Thomas Kincaid painting? I suspect it&#x27;s a little bit like the latter, which is fine. The Germans I have spoken with had no interest in poetry, good or bad, so they couldn&#x27;t offer any feedback. reply Mlller 11 hours agorootparentI, conversely, lack the knowledge to quite get the allusion to a Hallmark card or a Thomas Kincaid painting.I guess that Kincaid paintings are considered subpar by connoisseurs. That wouldnʼt be the thing with Morgenstern. He is popular, but not that popular, and was sufficiently unconventional at his time to be seen as a genuine creative artist.That is a comparison in terms of connoisseurship (or snobbery). If I had to make a comparison in terms of how the workʼs nature, Iʼd say that the shorter poems are like Roger Price droodles. reply monkeycantype 9 hours agorootparentprevOh I love christian morgenstern poems but I&#x27;ve only ever come across a handful. the one about the man who said he doesn&#x27;t exist! reply ItalianPoetry 3 hours agoparentprevNever mind, it was La sera del dì di festa.

I enjoy hearing from people who enjoy the game! replymrlonglong 10 hours agoprevThis chap has also built a 8088 PC clone. I&#x27;m just wondering why not a 8086? reply LukeShu 10 hours agoparentThere wasn&#x27;t really an important 8086 box. The first IBM PC (1981) used the 8088. The first 8086 PCs were the discount models in the PS&#x2F;2 line (April 1987), 3 years after the 80286 in the PC&#x2F;AT (1984); so the 8086 was already obsolete by the time it was in a PC. And later that year (August 1987) it would be even more obsolete when an 80386DX PS&#x2F;2 came out. reply MenhirMike 7 hours agorootparentThe one truly important 8086-based machine I can think of is the Japanese NEC PC-9801, so it would make some sense for someone to clone a machine like that. Though I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d clone the original 9801 that kicked off the entire line or rather go for the much improved NEC V30 chip instead. (Which also powered Irem&#x27;s M72 Arcade Board, which ran R-Type, and the latter M82&#x2F;M84 boards that gave us R-Type II - though arguably, arcade boards aren&#x27;t in the same category as home computers) reply pwg 7 hours agorootparentprev> The first 8086 PCs were the discount models in the PS&#x2F;2 line (April 1987)You missed two earlier ones. The Olivetti M24 (also sold as the AT&T 6300 in the US) was released in 1983 and used the 8086 CPU.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Olivetti_M24 reply BeetleB 6 hours agorootparentprev> The first 8086 PCs were the discount models in the PS&#x2F;2 line (April 1987)That doesn&#x27;t sound right to me. I recall growing up with friends who had 8086 PCs, bought prior to 1987. reply kjs3 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you think the only &#x27;important&#x27; thing in computing at that time was the IBM PC, then maybe you think there were no &#x27;important&#x27; 8086 boxes. There was a lot more going on at the time if you were actually there working at the time. reply colejohnson66 10 hours agoparentprevThe original IBM 5150 used the 8088, as did all the clones. So, assuming the author got ideas from old schematics, they would probably use the same chip. reply vasac 9 hours agoparentprevIs the 8086 so different from the 8088 that it requires a different BIOS? reply spc476 2 hours agorootparentKind of. The 8088 can use an 8-bit wide ROM chip, while the 8086 would require two such ROM chips, one for the even addresses, one for the odd addresses, given that the 8086 has a 16-bit data path. The software on the ROM chips can be the same. reply LukeShu 8 hours agorootparentprevYes. The external bus on the 8088 is 8-bit while the 8086 is 16-bit (which is why the 8086 wouldn&#x27;t appear in a PC until the mostly-80286 PS&#x2F;2 line, since the 8086 and the 80286 could use the same 16-bit PS&#x2F;2 bus). reply userbinator 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a hardware, not a software difference.With the exception of bus speeds &#x2F; timings and the differently sized prefetch queue, the 8088 and 8086 are 100% software-compatible so there wouldn&#x27;t need to be any difference in the BIOS. reply rocqua 3 hours agorootparentThe bios is much more hardware bound than it is software bound. It very much needs to talk to other hardware on the board. reply varjag 1 minute agorootparentThe only true difference is the multiplexed bus, not something that BIOS can be made aware of. mlyle 7 hours agorootparentprevAround the same time, there&#x27;s things like the Amstrad PPC512 (NEC V30, which is roughly 8086 pin compatible). reply kjs3 8 hours agorootparentprevThere were numerous 8086 PC compatibles before the PS&#x2F;2 or the 80286 became popular. The most famous was of course the original Compaq Deskpro, but At&t, Wang, Eagle and others did too. Yeah, the BIOS had to be aware of the difference between the 8088 and 8086 for some setup stuff, but the 8086 is at the hardware level perfectly happy to talk to an 8-bit bus and the software mostly never knew the difference.edit: And how could I forget (as mentioned by another poster in the thread) the numerous NEC PC98 machines with an 8086 which created their own industry. Sorry for slight, Japan. reply rasz 7 hours agorootparentprevand what does that have to do with BIOS? The only way you can tell 88 from 86 apart in software is speed and executing self modifying code to measure processor 4 vs 6 byte prefetch queue depth buffer size difference.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minuszerodegrees.net&#x2F;misc&#x2F;Determining%20Processo... reply rasz 7 hours agorootparentprevNo, CPU is irrelevant, even the early chipsets didnt try to invent anything and mostly implemented XT peripherals leading to universal exchangeable clone bioses.

If you use the NEC V40, a 186-style semi-integrated CPU, you don&#x27;t even need a seperate interrupt controller or timer component.Yet, it will run an off-the-shelf XT BIOS (or this BIOS) as long as you run about 10 instructions to configure the V40&#x27;s onboard peripherals to live at the right ports.You can add a DMA controller, but you don&#x27;t need it unless you want a floppy drive or Sound Blaster. reply cable2600 4 hours agoprevReminds me of ERSO BIOS.NASA still uses IBM PC and XT systems for some of their work as they haven&#x27;t converted the programs to newer hardware. reply ceving 2 hours agoprevWhat would you do with 4.77 MHz nowadays? reply rasz 1 hour agoparentOverclock it to ~7MHz using Doug Severson&#x27;s 1985 PC-Sprint https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;reeshub&#x2F;pc-sprint :)Epictronics: Overclocking IBM PCjr, 5150 PC, 5160 XT, 5155 Portable.

IDK about that bug though. reply bdowling 9 hours agorootparentDidn&#x27;t they notify buyers of the open source bios and share the code if a buyer wanted it? That may be enough to satisfy the GPL. reply LukeShu 8 hours agorootparentIDK what notices they provide, but:The copyright statement that prints on boot and indicates that it is licensed under the GPL has been stripped, violating section 4 and 5.d (now claims to be \"Copyright (C) 2022 CYCLE Logic\" with no mention of \"Copyright (C) 2010 - 2020 Sergey Kiselev\", and with no mention of the GPL).If you do request the source code from them, to their credit they do give it to you, but they code the give you has all (edit: most) of the copyright header-comments removed (violation of section 5.b).And generally, in neither the binary nor the source code indicate that it&#x27;s based on book8088 (violation of section 5.a). reply snvzz 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s so silly.They&#x27;d definitely sell more, not less, of these book8088s if they credited the bios and used upstream&#x27;s source.Particularly now that upstream directly supports the device. reply ok123456 6 hours agorootparentprevWhen you buy it they send you an archive that has the schematics for the machine, and a zip file that contains the source code to the rom with whatever modifications they made. reply rasz 7 hours agorootparentprevNo :) Its Chinese open source, Bunnie calls it Gongkai https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bunniestudios.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;?p=4297 You copy, rip out attribution, add some optional modifications and sell it as your own. reply userbinator 10 hours agoparentprevCould you explain that in a little more detail?

There&#x27;s a CGA chip (6845), with pretty limited registers to adjust timings (and a lot of software out there that expects to set these directly or for line timings and frame timings to be precisely known values).

Resisting certain types of information and actors online requires people to adopt new mental habits that help them avoid being tempted by attention-grabbing and potentially harmful content. We argue that digital information literacy must include the competence of critical ignoring—choosing what to ignore and where to invest one’s limited attentional capacities. We review three types of cognitive strategies for implementing critical ignoring: self-nudging, in which one ignores temptations by removing them from one’s digital environments; lateral reading, in which one vets information by leaving the source and verifying its credibility elsewhere online; and the do-not-feed-the-trolls heuristic, which advises one to not reward malicious actors with attention. We argue that these strategies implementing critical ignoring should be part of school curricula on digital information literacy. Teaching the competence of critical ignoring requires a paradigm shift in educators’ thinking, from a sole focus on the power and promise of paying close attention to an additional emphasis on the power of ignoring. Encouraging students and other online users to embrace critical ignoring can empower them to shield themselves from the excesses, traps, and information disorders of today’s attention economy. A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. (Simon, 1971, pp. 40–41) The function of ignoring, of inattention, is as vital a factor in mental progress as the function of attention itself. (James, 1904, p. 371) The digital world is artificially constructed. Moderated by algorithmic tools, it contains more information than the world’s libraries combined—but much of this information comes from unvetted sources and lacks conventional indicators of trustworthiness. People scrolling through their social-media feeds are confronted with a deluge of updates and messages—an ad for a new device, a meme from a friend, news about the pandemic, and opinions on anything from climate change to the latest celebrity misstep—all in an endless stream produced and shared by human beings and promoted by algorithms designed to make people dwell on the platform so they can be exposed to more ads (Wu, 2016). The challenges of dealing with overabundant and attention-grabbing information are amplified by the proliferation of false information and conspiracy theories, whose prevalence may lead people to doubt the very existence of “truth” or a shared reality. An entirely new vocabulary has become necessary to describe disinformation and online harassment tactics, such as flooding, trolling, JAQing, and sealioning.1 These tactics generate an excess of contradictory and irrelevant information in order to instill doubt, undermine a shared perception of reality, or simply distract people’s attention (Kozyreva et al., 2020; Lewandowsky, 2020). To counteract the challenges of false and misleading information and other attention-grabbing traps online, policy work has taken a multipronged approach, ranging from content moderation to fact checking and introduction of prompts that slow down the spread of false rumors (Lewandowsky et al., 2020). In addition, research has focused on preparing people to recognize and resist online manipulation and misinformation, through both preemptive (inoculation) and reactive (debunking) interventions (Ecker et al., 2022), and on improving people’s competencies for media and information literacy (e.g., Wineburg et al., 2022). Much effort has been invested in repurposing the notion of critical thinking—that is, “thinking that is purposeful, reasoned, and goal directed” (Halpern, 2013, p. 8)—from its origins in education to the online world. For example, Zucker (2019), addressing the National Science Teachers Association, wrote that because of the flood of misinformation “it is imperative that science teachers help students use critical thinking to examine claims they see, hear, or read that are not based on science” (p. 6). As important as the ability to think critically continues to be, we argue that it is insufficient to borrow the tools developed for offline environments and apply them to the digital world. When the world comes to people filtered through digital devices, there is no longer a need to decide what information to seek. Instead, the relentless stream of information has turned human attention into a scarce resource to be seized and exploited by advertisers and content providers. Investing effortful and conscious critical thinking in sources that should have been ignored in the first place means that one’s attention has already been expropriated (Caulfield, 2018). Digital literacy and critical thinking should therefore include a focus on the competence of critical ignoring: choosing what to ignore, learning how to resist low-quality and misleading but cognitively attractive information, and deciding where to invest one’s limited attentional capacities. Information Selection in the Attention Economy Being selective about available information is at the heart of human cognition. Virtually any time people process a stimulus, they do so only because they are ignoring multiple competing stimuli. At the level of perceptual processing, the mind must ignore irrelevant sensory information in order to focus on important objects in a continually changing environment (Gaspar & McDonald, 2014). The general ability to perform cognitive tasks, drawing on working memory capacity, is related to the ability to suppress irrelevant distractors (Gaspar et al., 2016). Ignoring information is also a distinctive feature of decision making of a boundedly rational mind (i.e., a real-world mind that is limited in time, knowledge, foresight, and cognitive resources; Simon, 1990). A key class of decision-making strategies consists of heuristic strategies. Their nature is to ignore “part of the information with the goal of making decisions more quickly, frugally, and/or accurately” than is possible with more complex strategies (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011, p. 454).2 Information selection is mediated through one’s physical and social environments and their cues that signal, among other things, danger, reward, or emotional states of other people. Being attuned to these valuable signals (and ignoring what is essentially irrelevant) is crucial for efficient functioning of any biological or artificial agent with limited resources (Simon, 1990). Ideally, humans’ cognitive tools for separating valuable from to-be-ignored information are adapted to the environments they operate in. However, humans’ long-standing evolved, learned, and taught tools for information selection may be inadequate in the digital world, where the power of information filtering and control over environmental signals rests mainly with platforms that curate content through a combination of algorithmic tools and choice architectures (i.e., designs for presenting choices to users). For instance, in the world of small social groups in which humans have evolved, paying attention to surprising or emotionally charged information is important, because it usually signals potential dangers or rewards. However, online, the same cues and attention markers that indicate important information in a social group can be misused by content generators to attract attention to falsehoods and tempt people into spreading them. Indeed, Vosoughi et al. (2018) found that false stories that “successfully” turned viral were likely to inspire fear, disgust, and surprise; true stories, in contrast, triggered anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. The human proclivity to attend more to negative than to positive things (Soroka et al., 2019) may explain why messages featuring moral-emotional language (e.g., language expressing negative emotions, such as moral outrage) are more likely to be shared than messages with neutral language are (Brady et al., 2017). Unscrupulous content generators can exploit this bias and can continually refine their messages by monitoring the success (measured by engagement and sharing) of different versions—a facility, known as “A/B testing,” that is at the heart of Facebook’s advertising system (see Meta, 2022). Misleading and low-quality information becomes an even more profound risk when it is part of a targeted campaign. The “infodemic” of misinformation and calculated disinformation about COVID-19 not only pollutes the Web with false and dubious information, but also undermines citizens’ health literacy, fosters vaccine hesitancy, and cultivates detrimental outcomes for individuals and society. This infodemic is nontrivial because exposure to misinformation has been shown to reduce people’s intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19 (Loomba et al., 2021). Such harmful content, although it might be shared and embraced by a part of the public, often originates from malicious actors who are motivated by a variety of factors, including financial, ideological, and lobbying interests (e.g., climate denial is a concentrated effort; Oreskes & Conway, 2011). Malicious actors also use trolling and other harassment tactics to intimidate and silence opposing voices. Moreover, competition for attention creates an overabundance of content that, although not necessarily harmful in itself, can negatively affect other important indicators of life quality, such as the amount of leisure time and well-being. In sum, digital environments present new challenges to people’s cognition and attention. People must therefore develop new mental habits, or retool those from other domains, to prevent merchants of low-quality information from hijacking their cognitive resources. One key such competence is the ability to deliberately and strategically ignore information. Critical Ignoring for Information Management Deliberate ignorance refers to the conscious choice to ignore information even when the costs of obtaining it are negligible (Hertwig & Engel, 2016). People deliberately ignore information for various reasons—for instance, to avoid anticipated negative emotions, to ensure fairness, or to maximize suspense and surprise. Deliberate ignorance can also be a tool for boosting information management, especially online (Kozyreva et al., 2020). Critical ignoring (Wineburg, 2021) is a type of deliberate ignorance that entails selectively filtering and blocking out information in order to control one’s information environment and reduce one’s exposure to false and low-quality information. This competence complements conventional critical-thinking and information-literacy skills, such as finding reliable information online, by specifying how to avoid information that is misleading, distractive, and potentially harmful. It is only by ignoring the torrent of low-quality information that people can focus on applying critical search skills to the remaining now-manageable pool of potentially relevant information. As do all types of deliberate ignorance, critical ignoring requires cognitive and motivational resources (e.g., impulse control) and, somewhat ironically, knowledge: In order to know what to ignore, a person must first understand and detect the warning signs of low trustworthiness. Critical Ignoring in the Digital World: Information Types and Tools What are strategies for implementing critical ignoring? Different types of problematic information—such as distracting information, misinformation and disinformation, and interference by malicious actors—may require different mitigation strategies. We discuss three strategies—self-nudging, lateral reading, and the do-not-feed-the-trolls heuristic—and the circumstances in which they can be applied (see also Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Critical ignoring online: types of information, corresponding strategies for critical ignoring, and targeted outcomes of those strategies. OPEN IN VIEWER Self-nudging: removing distracting and low-quality information Clickbait stories (“Ebola in the Air? A Nightmare That Could Happen”), emotional and sensational content, “breaking news”—the various forms of low-quality information are as tempting to the attentional system as junk food is to the taste buds. The key to controlling addictive habits—whether cutting out online gossip or sugary treats—is not to exercise superhuman willpower but rather to employ situational control strategies (Duckworth et al., 2016).3 This involves making changes to one’s environment in order to manage exposure to temptation. For instance, someone who cannot resist sweets can make them less accessible—putting them at the back of the hardest-to-reach shelf—to help control the urge to eat them. The same rationale can be harnessed for an information diet. Self-nudging is a cognitive boost (Hertwig & Grüne-Yanoff, 2017) that fosters people’s competencies to design their environment in a way that works best for them. Self-nudging has roots in research on a behavioral policy approach called nudging (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008) and psychological research on situational self-control (Duckworth et al., 2016). Using extensively studied mechanisms of interventions, such as positional effects (e.g., making healthy food options more accessible in a supermarket or a cafeteria), defaults (e.g., making data privacy a default setting), or social norms, the self-nudger redesigns choice architectures to prompt behavioral change. However, instead of requiring a public choice architect, self-nudging empowers people to change their own environments (Reijula & Hertwig, 2022), thus making them citizen choice architects whose autonomy and agency is preserved and fostered. To deal with attention-grabbing information online, people can apply self-nudging principles to organize their information environment so as to reduce temptation. For instance, digital self-nudges, such as setting time limits on the use of social media (e.g., via the Screen Time app on iPhone) or converting one’s screen to a grayscale mode, have been demonstrated to help people reduce their screen time (Zimmermann & Sobolev, 2020). A more radical self-nudge consists of removing temptations by deactivating the most distracting social-media apps (at least for a period of time). In a study by Allcott et al. (2020), participants who were incentivized to deactivate their Facebook accounts for 1 month gained on average about 60 min per day for offline activities, a gain that was associated with small increases in subjective well-being. Reduced online activity also modestly decreased factual knowledge of political news (but not political participation), as well as political polarization (but not affective polarization). As this study shows, there are trade-offs between potential gains (e.g., time for offline activities) and losses (e.g., potentially becoming less informed) in such solutions. The key goal of self-nudging, however, is not to optimize information consumption, but rather to offer a range of measures that can help people regain control of their information environments and align those environments with their goals, including goals regarding how to distribute their time and attention among different competing sources (e.g., friends on social media and friends and family offline). Lateral reading: verifying credibility on the Web Organized disinformation or misleading information that masquerades as legitimate is difficult to ignore, especially when it comes from political leaders and celebrities. Sources that disseminate such information adopt easily gamed indicators of epistemic quality, such as official-looking logos, scientific language, and top-level domains (e.g., dot.org; Wineburg & Ziv, 2019) in order to appear trustworthy. Other tricks include adding hyperlinks to reliable sources that look dependable enough to mask the fact that the sources do not actually support the claim being made (Breakstone et al., 2022). In a digital environment, looks can be deceiving. It is often impossible to know the real agenda behind a site or a post simply by examining it. The trick is to not waste time doing so. Instead, a person can follow the strategy of professional fact-checkers known as lateral reading (Wineburg et al., 2022; Wineburg & McGrew, 2019). Lateral reading begins with a key insight: One cannot necessarily know how trustworthy a website or a social-media post is by engaging with and critically reflecting on its content. Without relevant background knowledge or reliable indicators of trustworthiness, the best strategy for deciding whether one can believe a source is to look up the author or organization and the claims elsewhere (e.g., using search engines or Wikipedia to get pointers to reliable sources). The strategy of lateral reading was identified by studying what makes professional fact-checkers more successful in verifying information on the Web compared with other competent adults (undergraduates at an elite university and Ph.D. historians from five different universities; Wineburg & McGrew, 2019). Instead of dwelling on an unfamiliar site (i.e., reading vertically), fact-checkers strategically and deliberately ignored it until they first opened new tabs to search for information about the organization or individual behind it. If lateral reading indicates that the site is untrustworthy, examining it directly would waste precious time and energy. Although this strategy might require motivation and time to learn and practice, it is a time-saver in the long run. In the study just mentioned, fact-checkers needed only a few seconds to determine trustworthiness of the source. Lateral reading is part of the Civic Online Reasoning curriculum, whose effectiveness has been demonstrated in multiple studies (Axelsson et al., 2021; Brodsky et al., 2021; McGrew et al., 2019; Wineburg et al., 2022). For instance, in a recent field experiment across an entire urban school district in the United States (Wineburg et al., 2022), students who completed six 50-min lessons focusing on lateral reading and related strategies (n = 271) were significantly better judging the credibility of digital content relative to students in a control group (n = 228). Panizza et al. (2022), testing adults, also demonstrated that lateral reading can improve the ability to evaluate the accuracy of unfamiliar sources on a social-media website when prompted by a quick pop-up with tips on how to check information’s credibility. Do not feed the trolls: ignoring malicious actors Sometimes it is not the information but the people who produce it who need to be actively ignored. Problematic online behavior, including promulgation of disinformation and harassment, can usually be traced back to real people—more often than not to just a few extremely active individuals. Indeed, close to 65% of antivaccine content posted to Facebook and Twitter in February and March 2021 is attributable to just 12 individuals (Center for Countering Digital Hate, 2021). Despite being a minority, conspiracy theorists and science denialists can be vocal enough to cause damage. Their strategy is to consume people’s attention by creating the appearance of a debate where none exists (e.g., Oreskes & Conway, 2011). One productive response is to resist engaging with these individuals or their claims by ignoring them. This approach can be implemented both on the individual and on the infrastructural level. For instance, reddit.com’s AskHistorians subreddit, one of the largest history forums online, removes questions that use the JAQing technique to deny the basic facts of the Holocaust (Breit, 2018). Another category of bad actors online consists of those engaged in trolling, cyberbullying, and other forms of online harassment. Harassment—including physical threats, stalking, insults, and sexual harassment—is prevalent online; 41% of Americans say that they personally have experienced at least one form of such abuse (Vogels, 2021). Trolling, which includes interpersonal antisocial behaviors, such as deception, aggression, and disruption, is a particularly common and concerning type of online harassment (Craker & March, 2016). Online harassment exacts an emotional toll on victims and erodes online civility. Crucially, as Craker and March (2016) demonstrated, individuals who engage in trolling are motivated by negative social power, and their trolling behavior is reinforced by the adverse impact their actions have (e.g., annoying and upsetting people). To fight back, as one of the authors of this study (March, 2016) argued, one needs to withdraw that negative social reward, thereby diminishing trolls’ motivation to engage in antisocial behavior. This strategy (which is useful for dealing with other malicious actors, such as superspreaders of mis- and disinformation, as well) is known as the do-not-feed-the-trolls heuristic. It consists of two rules: First, do not respond directly to trolls; do not correct them, engage in debate, retaliate, or troll in response. Second, instead, block trolls and report them to the platform. Another support for the use of this heuristic comes from the expert advice emphasizing the importance of two factors when dealing with online harassment: (a) seeking help and support from one’s social group and/or professionals and (b) not engaging with the malicious actors and instead blocking their messages. For example, UNICEF (n.d.) advises that, when bullying happens on a social-media platform, one should “consider blocking the bully and formally reporting their behaviour on the platform itself” (Question 4). Finally, it is important to note that no one can—or should—bear the burden of online abuse and disinformation alone. The do-not-feed-the-trolls heuristic must be complemented by users reporting bad actors to platforms and by platforms implementing consistent content-moderation policies. It is also crucial to ensure that trolling and flooding tactics of science denialists are not left without response on the platform level. Platforms’ content-moderation policies and design choices should be the first line of defense against harmful online behavior. Strategies and interventions aimed at fostering critical thinking and critical ignoring competencies in online users should not be regarded as a substitute for developing and implementing systemic and infrastructural solutions at the platform and regulator levels. Empowering individuals and fostering better digital competencies is part of the defense against online harm but must not be misused by regulators and platforms as an alibi for doing nothing. Critical Ignoring as a New Paradigm for Education The digital world’s attention economy, the presence of malicious actors, and the ubiquity of alluring but false or misleading information present users with cognitive, emotional, and motivational challenges. Mastering these challenges will require new competencies. An indispensable component of navigating online information and preserving one’s autonomy on the Internet is the ability to ignore large amounts of information. Critical-ignoring strategies, as part of a curriculum in information management, should therefore be included in school curricula. Traditionally, the search for knowledge has involved paying close attention to information—finding it and considering it from multiple angles. Reading a text from beginning to end to critically evaluate it is a sensible approach to vetted school texts approved by competent overseers. On the unvetted Internet, however, this approach often ends up being a colossal waste of time and energy. In an era in which attention is the new currency, the admonition to “pay careful attention” is precisely what attention merchants and malicious agents exploit. It is time to revisit and expand the concept of critical thinking, often seen as the bedrock of an informed citizenry. As long as students are led to believe that critical thinking requires above all the effortful processing of text, they will continue to fall prey to informational traps and manipulated signals of epistemic quality. At the same time that students learn critical thinking, they should learn the core competence of thoughtfully and strategically allocating their attentional resources online. This will often entail selecting a few valuable pieces of information and deliberately ignoring others (Hertwig & Engel, 2016). This insight, although crucial in the digital age, is not new. As William James (1904) observed, “The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook” (p. 369). Recommended Reading Hertwig, R., & Engel, C. (2016). (See References).

We use the term misinformation to refer to any information that later turns out to have been false. We reserve the term disinformation to refer to messages that the communicator knows to be false but is disseminating for political or personal purposes. Flooding consists of inundating online spaces with a torrent of messages to dominate and disrupt conversation and drown out dissenting voices. Trolling is a form of online harassment that involves posting provocative and inflammatory messages in order to disrupt the conversation and upset other people. Sealioning is a type of trolling and a harassment tactic of pestering participants in online discussions with disingenuous questions and incessant requests for evidence under the guise of sincerity. Similarly, JAQing (“just asking questions”) is a tactic of disingenuously framing false or misleading statements as questions. GO TO FOOTNOTE 2. For example, the take-the-best heuristic models how people infer which of two alternatives has a higher value on a criterion, on the basis of binary cues and cue values retrieved from memory. It assumes that search proceeds through cues in order of their validity. Selection is implemented by the stopping rule: The heuristic stops when it reaches the first cue that discriminates between the alternatives. The heuristic thus uses the single most predictive and discriminative cue for a task (e.g., a friend’s recommendation for which of two restaurants has the best food) and ignores the rest (e.g., price, rating by food websites, cuisine type). GO TO FOOTNOTE 3. According to Duckworth et al. (2016), situational self-control strategies include situation-selection strategies, which “involve intentionally choosing to be in situations that favor goal-oriented valuation systems over temptation-oriented valuation systems” (p. 40), and situation-modification strategies, which “entail purposefully changing [one’s] circumstances to advantage” (p. 40). Duckworth et al. provided both a theoretical framework and an overview of the available evidence supporting the effectiveness of situational self-control strategies in the domains of substance use, eating and exercise, academic performance, and saving for retirement.

Sometimes I get sucked in to nonsense topics too, although recently I&#x27;ve gotten a lot better at noticing and stopping myself from going down the rabbit hole.It would help a lot if you had support networks to nudge you in the right direction. For me it&#x27;s often as simple as asking \"why do you even care about this?\" or \"why is this so important to you?\". And that realization and consideration can often snap people out.As someone who participates a lot in online discussions, sometimes people get into really unproductive discourse which keeps going around in circles, so I think it&#x27;s useful to have norms around refocusing the conversation and reminding people of their core values.It&#x27;s also useful to give yourself a limit to how deeply you&#x27;re willing to engage on certain topics with Internet strangers, especially if you don&#x27;t see the conversation going anywhere productive or meaningful after a while. The ability to walk away is a superpower. When you achieve enlightenment you gain the ability to let people be wrong on the internet without it bothering you. reply figassis 16 hours agoparentI&#x27;m often flexible in my beliefs, and I believe this is a superpower, but it can be dangerous if you don&#x27;t place some principled boundaries on your self, or how much you can allow yourself to be convinced to change your opinion. Rabbit holes can take you all the way to radicalization. This allows me to understand that I might be wrong without having to change my beliefs. What changes is that I simply stop trying to convince others of those beliefs I hold. reply hiAndrewQuinn 6 hours agorootparentI see strongly held beliefs as similar to Odysseus tying himself to the mast in order to hear the sirens. You make a small sacrifice of \"true rationality\" where you always let the evidence sway you, in order to reach something else you think is much more important.More often than not this important thing really is an experience of sublime beauty, another prescient part of the story. Not always. But often. reply fknorangesite 16 hours agorootparentprev> I&#x27;m often flexible in my beliefs ... but it can be dangerous if you don&#x27;t place some principled boundaries on your selfAs the saying goes: have an open mind, but not so open that your brain falls out. reply svieira 15 hours agorootparent\"The purpose of opening your mind, as with opening your mouth, is to shut it again on something solid.\"G. K. Chesterton reply throw__away7391 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t really agree with this at all. You need to keep possibilities open for forever. I would guess that whoever the author has decided on some opinions he considers \"solid\" and feels that other people need to come to agree with him. This is hardly a remarkable position. reply edmundsauto 14 hours agorootparentIn my experience, keeping possibilities open has a cost. It’s like leaving a port open on a server just in case, or letting clients idle.All resources, including my attention, are limited. We have to prune our gardens to create space for other things. reply Gud 4 hours agorootparentThis also means you will be wrong on some topics you are not willing to reconsider. reply gingerrr 14 hours agorootparentprevTo extend the original metaphor - your mouth doesn&#x27;t stay shut forever, or you starve. So the idea is more to sink your brain or teeth into substantive thoughts, as you encounter them. It&#x27;s not about closing your mind&#x2F;mouth around a new dogma, but about exercising them for nutrition not for pleasure&#x2F;vice (or letting them atrophy).I think the \"re-closing\" of the mind here more represents fitting new information into a new holistic, consistent worldview. New information would obviously require that exercise again.Chesterton is simply arguing against allowing yourself to be buffeted by the winds of thought trend, to the point you have no center. reply throw__away7391 13 hours agorootparentWell it&#x27;s a bad one. It isn&#x27;t even a metaphor really, it&#x27;s a word game relying on particulars of the English language, and it breaks down quite quickly as you could just as easily express the exact opposite point with slightly different phrasing, e.g. you need new food each day. I guess you could print it on a coaster to put your \"eat pray love\" mug on. reply gingerrr 13 hours agorootparent> It isn&#x27;t even a metaphor really, it&#x27;s a word game relying on particulars of the English languageIt&#x27;s absolutely a metaphor, just because you didn&#x27;t understand it doesn&#x27;t change the meaning the author conveyed. It&#x27;s written in English, I&#x27;m not sure what point you think you are making by pointing that out.> you could just as easily express the exact opposite pointSo you didn&#x27;t read my comment you replied to? You need new nutritive food each day, not junk or empty calories - the metaphor covers this exact scenario.When you&#x27;re eating every day do you just grab literally the first thing at hand and stuff your face until you&#x27;re full? Or do you make conscious choices about what to put in your body?If you&#x27;re in the first camp you may not understand this metaphor - it&#x27;s for people who consciously consume, both food and thoughts. If you mindlessly scroll and ideate, sorry you&#x27;re the target of Chesterton&#x27;s criticism - that doesn&#x27;t make his metaphor bad, it just makes his argument valid.> I guess you could print it on a coaster to put your \"eat pray love\" mug onThe irony, considering you&#x27;re engaging with this quote at the same shallow level you claim to criticize.G.K. Chesterton has an entire body of intellectual work consistent with the quote and metaphor extension I&#x27;ve done above - but you&#x27;ve decided to tilt at the windmill of a pithy quote as if it&#x27;s synecdoche. reply throw__away7391 12 hours agorootparent> G.K. Chesterton has an entire body of intellectual workAs a Christian apologist. His views were a foregone conclusion. No one who engages in such games deserves to be taken seriously.This is completely \"consistent\" at least with so-called \"Christian intellectuals\", as they want other people to be \"open minded\" to their proselytizing while they themselves remain completely closed to the even possibility that they&#x27;re completely wrong. They do not engage in good faith and see no problems with this because they consider their ultimate aims more important. reply gingerrr 12 hours agorootparentHis arguments against absolute open-mindedness weren&#x27;t grounded in discussions of his faith - even just the full version of his quote shows that, it was in reply to a metaphor for theory of mind his friend told him:\"For my friend said that he opened his intellect as the sun opens the fans of a palm tree, opening for opening&#x27;s sake, opening infinitely for ever. But I said that I opened my intellect as I opened my mouth, in order to shut it again on something solid. I was doing it at the moment. And as I truly pointed out, it would look uncommonly silly if I went on opening my mouth infinitely, for ever and ever.\"Other variations of the quote he told included an addendum: \"The object of opening the mind, as of opening the mouth, is to shut it again on something solid. Otherwise it is more akin to a sewer, taking in all things equally.\"Neither of those relate to grounding his epistemology in Catholicism.While I definitely agree his Christian apologia means a heavy dose of salt with intellectual claims, he&#x27;s not even arguing for a moral center in this metaphor. Simply an intellectual self, to not be a gaping maw of consumption, as you wouldn&#x27;t be physically.Discernment with respect to ideas you&#x27;re willing to entertain isn&#x27;t exclusively the domain of religion, as far as I&#x27;m aware. replyhiAndrewQuinn 18 hours agoparentprevIf an imaginary bored teenage version of yourself ran across what you wrote, at 6 PM on a Thursday night, would they read it with interest or at least amusement?

There&#x27;s also the possibility of implying that any online discourse is shit (which is an opinion I can hear yet disagree with but ok).> I find that HN often penalizes users when they write the way that people often speak.Written and oral English aren&#x27;t exactly the same language although they have a lot in common (at the very least the rules differ a bit). I&#x27;d venture to guess that sentence structures and overall discourse (I mean: the way they use the language to achieve communication, not the grammatical rules to form comprehensive sentences) of someone who swears still show differences between oral and written expression.Anyway, I am guilty of downvoting comments with too much swear words (because it&#x27;s noise to me and it&#x27;s distracting from the topic at hand, either because I have to factor the wow factor into the arguments or to ignore it when it&#x27;s just how people express themselves).Funny thing that happened once: I added a \"and... language please ?\" in my reply to a comment with foul language and the counter reply was \"what are you... a child ?\". I left it at that but that&#x27;s precisely because I am an adult that I don&#x27;t want to discuss using too much swear words.. but I can see how the reverse could be valid for someone else.In real life, I swear wayyyyyy too much. reply Loughla 15 hours agorootparentTo me, swear words are like salt and pepper.Some good meals (professional conversations) don&#x27;t need them.Basic meals (casual conversation) are almost always better with them.Too much is bad for your heart, but they tend to improve the flavor of a discourse. reply thimkerbell 15 hours agorootparentprevnot to strangers. reply thimkerbell 17 hours agoparentprevWe need the equivalent of tl;dr for concise communication, for intellectual mood, to mean \"Disagree (or there&#x27;s nuance needed here) but declining to engage.\" Maybe \"Thanks but no\"?And it should be present anyplace there&#x27;s a Like button. There should also be a way for the writer to get a sense for whether it&#x27;s coming from people whose judgment they respect. (And (someday maybe) also a way to offer to compensate someone for their time, if they&#x27;ll explain.)But all of this is predicated on social media remaining viable. reply bluefirebrand 17 hours agorootparent> \"Disagree (or there&#x27;s nuance needed here) but declining to engage.\"Unfortunately this is still engaging, and many people I&#x27;ve encountered online will not let things go after this. It&#x27;s why people instead use downvotes for disagreement, I think. It lets them take a disagreeing action, but without anyone being able to single them out and rage at them all day for it (which is unfortunately common on social media)I often find that if I disagree with someone and then don&#x27;t want to engage further, I have to mute or block them entirely so they don&#x27;t shit up my notifications for hours, each one a small little temptation to go re-engage. reply dotnet00 14 hours agorootparentThis is why I appreciate that HN doesn&#x27;t do notifications. Sometimes I&#x27;m just looking to share my opinion without really being interested in argument or discussion. So it&#x27;s nice to not be bugged by notifications. reply 6510 2 hours agorootparentprevI cant imagine having any kind of discussion without the other(s) disagreeing. I desire to completely understand how someone came to the opposite conclusion. I equate anger in the process with brainwashing: You convince the person of the nonsense then you finish the job by training them to not take in further information. Getting angry is the best kind of closed mind. (I get angry too of course! It&#x27;s hilarious!) Communication takes [at least] 2 people, it takes effort. Ideally both parties make the effort but I don&#x27;t mind compensating for other peoples shortcomings.It also helps to know nearly all things people think they know are extreme simplifications. (great pun) There is enough fuzzy logic to be wrong about almost anything. 1000 years from now, things we consider fact will be a laughing stock. It will be as funny as Jesus landing his space ship on the white house lawn. reply thimkerbell 15 hours agorootparentprevi disagree (or there&#x27;s nuance needed here) but am declining to engage reply dullcrisp 17 hours agorootparentprevI usually wind up using sarcasm for this purpose (and perhaps to make a brief point). I’m not suggesting that everyone use sarcasm with abandon, but I think it has its place.I appreciate the need for clarity in writing, but I worry that our idealization of workmanlike language greatly narrows the range of what we can convey.People have been communicating in writing for centuries and have invented a wealth of literary devices to communicate their thoughts more completely. reply metabagel 17 hours agorootparentI try to avoid sarcasm. I try to respond dispassionately and to pick one key part of their argument and say why I disagree with it. Or if I think they are being unhelpful with their tone, I tell them so.I do use sarcasm sometimes, but I feel like it is generally an attempt to score a win in an argument, not to persuade. And I’m not generally trying to persuade the person I am responding to, but the lurkers who read the comments. reply dullcrisp 16 hours agorootparentIsn’t “winning” an argument the same as making your point in a way that most dispassionate third-party observers would agree with you? I usually hear the dichotomy between winning and persuasion used to mean persuading the person you’re talking to, which might involve weakening your point to appeal to them. reply s1artibartfast 15 hours agorootparent\"Winning\" depends on what your goal is.I dont think that impressing third parties is really a healthy or useful goal for internet discourse. Omniscient&#x2F;logical third-parties dont exist and the esteem of anonymous peers is hollow, so it usually reduces to self-aggrandizement and ego-stroking.I dont even think it is helpful to approach discourse as arguments. The best approach IMHO is to strive for a mutual exchange of information.Of course, this runs counter to most intuitive behaviors. As a result, you rarely see people asking questions to the opposition, aside from sarcasm, or Socratic debate.Do you think persuasion is more valuable than being persuaded? reply dullcrisp 14 hours agorootparentI don’t think I can persuade someone away from one of their core values. Best I can do is put ideas out there and hope to make some impression on someone.That said, treating discussions as a mutual exchange of information is precisely the thing that I find insufficient (outside the literal sense in which everything is a mere exchange of information).Discussion is about persuasion and collective decision making. You can’t find truth and seek agreement just by collecting more data.Rationalists seem to have the sense that we’re all just on the cusp of enlightenment, if we only had a bit more information. They refuse to accept the world as the messy and confusing thing that it is. But as I said, that’s not a point of view that I can dissuade anyone from directly. You can only sway people who aren’t personally invested in the subject.Edit: Since you asked about being persuaded, I find that that my views change slowly and naturally as I think through the points I’m making and experience different things. Of course if someone could set me straight though an internet comment box that would be a great shortcut, but since we’ve all formed our points of view through a lifetime of experience it usually doesn’t work that way. reply s1artibartfast 10 hours agorootparentI think we see eye-to eye on a couple things, and disagree on others.I agree most people&#x27;s core values only shift slowly over time. However, most topics of discussion or debate are not about core values themselves. they are about loosely related topics bound by layers of assumptions and beliefs. This is where information sharing is important, and fundamental to learning.I don&#x27;t know that anyone can find truth without a process of learning.On the other-hand, I don&#x27;t see collective decision making and persuasion as a route to truth or learning at all.I agree that rationalist oversimplify, and think that is basically because they already hold utilitarianism as a fundamental axiom. That said, I think the objective of being \"less wrong\" is a pretty good one.I&#x27;m not sure what humanity is left with if we give up on truth or accuracy a mutual objective of discussion. reply dullcrisp 8 hours agorootparentI apologize for getting slightly mystical here, but I think of humanity as a vast consciousness, learning and growing and reasoning and evolving. We’re tiny aspects of that consciousness. We observe, develop ideas, bounce them off each other, deliberate, and eventually some take hold and spread, changing how mankind collectively sees the world.It’s not enough to just share information with each other, and lately the internet has made that increasingly less necessary. We need to test our ideas, subject them to collective scrutiny, and try to spread or adapt them in response to those of others. There aren’t always great forums to do that in, but I think it’s worthwhile in principle. replys1artibartfast 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat would the ultimate goal of this be?I don&#x27;t really see people reassessing their beliefs based on the number of down votes they get - even if some down voters are respected.Maybe Im missing something, because your idea, sans id&#x27;s, sounds like what sites like HN or reddit already have. reply thimkerbell 15 hours agorootparentThe \"someone wrong on internet\" urge to weigh in (and not have your silence be misinterpreted) gets sated. And the recipient gets some feedback. reply s1artibartfast 14 hours agorootparentI think there is a lot to unpack there, especially regarding if that is a good urge to indulge, and if silence should be viewed in that light.That said, what do you think about the idea that many sites already have what you described, including this one. reply BolexNOLA 14 hours agoparentprevIt is wild how difficult it is to break out of the cycle. When I really put my mind to it I can “be good” for a few weeks, but all it takes is one bad discussion to get me to act a little more hostile than I should. And sometimes that’s all it takes for me to backslide again for months. I wish I could say I was more mature than that, but I’m simply not. Or at least I’m not at this stage. Lately I have been trying again to turn over a new leaf, and so far I think I’m doing OK? But it has only been like a week so we will see lolOne of my favorite “methods” or whatever you want to call it I learned years ago, I believe on Reddit. This is also broadly applicable to most social situations in which you are deciding whether or not to broach a certain subject.You ask yourself three questions, all three of which must be satisfied before you say whatever it is you were thinking:1) Does it need to be said?2) Does it need to be said by me?3) Does it need to be said by me right now? reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 17 hours agoparentprev> \"why do you even care about this?\" or \"why is this so important to you?\"This is my tactic as well. I&#x27;m in New England and a coworker was once distraught that someone dismantled a statue in the south. I asked if they had any idea that the statue existed beforehand? They did not. reply exoverito 17 hours agorootparentI would imagine it&#x27;s less about any given statue and more about it being indicative of a kind of cultural revolution. It&#x27;s not necessarily a bad tactic, though imagine asking people if they knew George Floyd existed before the video. If people followed that heuristic and didn&#x27;t get worked up into a frenzy then we wouldn&#x27;t have had the riots and largest YoY increase in homicides in US history. Though I think the video was more a catalyst for unleashing the pent up frustrations of a populace forced under house arrest, living in fear of a virus, economic uncertainty, etc. reply metabagel 17 hours agorootparentA person’s life has value, even if we aren’t aware of them. reply bluefirebrand 17 hours agorootparentSo does a statue, just not as much. reply kortilla 14 hours agorootparentprevGetting distraught about the destruction of something symbolic or culturally meaningful without knowing about it first before-hand is perfectly normal.I found out about many of the artifacts for the first time in [1] after they were destroyed and was still upset by it.Your question does not adequately reflect why someone should or should not care about something.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Destruction_of_cultural_herita... reply dymk 17 hours agorootparentprev\"Why is this so important to you?\" only works if you&#x27;re asking someone who isn&#x27;t already having an emotional knee-jerk reaction to something.

Then you go and shut them down by asking them why they care.It&#x27;s important to recognize that their anger being irrelevant towards the issue also means that there isn&#x27;t much lost by letting them vent. reply franksvalli 18 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s comforting to me that this has been a challenge for many generations, the only difference is now the distractions are digital.From Zhuangzi, Warring States period in China (born around 369 BC): But to wear out your brain trying to make things into one without realizing that they are all the same - this is called \"three in the morning\". What do I mean by \"three in the morning\"? When the monkey trainer was handing out acorns, he said, \"You get three in the morning and four at night\". This made all the monkeys furious. \"Well, then\", he said, \"you get four in the morning and three at night\". The monkeys all were delighted. There was no change in the reality behind the words, and yet the monkeys responded with joy and anger. Let them, if they want to. So the sage harmonizes with both right and wrong and rests in Heaven the Equalizer. This is called walking two roads.(note: Burton Watson translation)I interpret this to mean first that what the monkeys care about is petty and trivial (like the petty distractions we all encounter daily), and more importantly at the end of the day there&#x27;s no real change in the situation one way or another (the sum either way is seven acorns). The monkeys, caring about these trivial things, are happy they won the argument and got their way, even though it amounts to no significant difference at the end of the day.So let it be. reply simmerup 16 hours agoparentThe other side is that rulers in China likely encouraged this apathy to make people more pliable and controllable reply mantas 15 hours agorootparentJust like nowadays.There&#x27;s a famous columnist-wannabe-politician in my country.

If it’s just for an iPhone sure, it’s definitely sarcasm. If it’s a comment about not saving money at all and just scraping by enough to sustain and argue philosophy, then there are a lot of people that would agree with the non-sarcastic take.The phrase would have been better replacing “saving for” with “coveting” or something that better disambiguates a statement against materialism from one supporting selfish financial recklessness. reply spacebacon 16 hours agoparentprevExcellent reply zarathustreal 17 hours agoparentprevIf I may add a contrary perspective here, I think this passage appears more clever than it actually is. For example, to draw a conclusion about oneself from this there would have to be a (false) implied equivalence between monkey reasoning and human reasoning, where a monkey may be simply ignorant of the sum and driven primarily by instinct towards a larger initial quantity, a human may have much more complex reasoning for choosing a larger up-front portion stemming from self-awareness (such as the knowledge that they may not be alive to receive the evening portion, or the knowledge that the trainer may be lying about a second handout). The fact is, they were not all the same.

That&#x27;s hacking the male mind... reply asimpletune 18 hours agoparentYeah, I think the process of socializing, especially in person, leverages some kind of hardware acceleration that we all have and counteracts these gaps in our security, but the moment people get online all of a sudden all that biology just goes out the window.Just imagine, for example, the in-person equivalent of a YT conspiracy video. It would be some motor-mouth at a party who traps you in a corner to tell you all about how the field of archaeology is an elaborate hoax meant to keep us from finding out the \"truth\". You would basically smile and node, or maybe even humor them for a second, but the moment you get a whiff that there is an unlimited stream of this stuff you would look for the nearest exit.Videos that play on people&#x27;s insecurities would just be that friend in your group who&#x27;s the emotional vampire, that always requires a tag team to manage.And yet, as soon as these personalities take their form online, we find them interesting, irresistible even. Like, \"But, this guy says that giants used to walk the earth and the fact that all pyramids look the same can&#x27;t be just a coincidence.\", and the next thing you know you find a community among others and some people get completely swallowed by one grift or another.I guess this kind of thing has been happening for a while too, with TV, it&#x27;s just become a lot more effective now with networked computers. reply parasti 17 hours agorootparentWorth pointing out that modern social media is built on maximum-engagement, more-of-the-same recommendation algorithms that are a perfect fit for spreading these kinds of content.

But it&#x27;s a surprisingly high bar. Expensive items may pass easily, if I perceive them as a much-needed, notable improvement. Many items won&#x27;t, even if they&#x27;re free.Why I do this? Because all stuff has a cost attached: €$£, environmental footprint from manufacture&#x2F;disposal, (physical) storage space, mental capacity & time spent on its maintenance, etc. Even \"free\" stuff really isn&#x27;t free. And I prefer to spend any of those resources where it&#x27;s most useful (or makes me happy, anyway).Info-processing is no different. That funny cat video isn&#x27;t just making you laugh.

I haven&#x27;t thought it through systematically and organized it, so my apologies for its long-winded, rambling form:1) Your time is highly, irremediably constrained. Someone said: You inherited a free bank account but it holds all the funds you&#x27;ll ever own. You&#x27;ll never have more and you must withdraw daily.2) Information was also constrained for the 7 million years of our brains&#x27; evolution from proto-chimps; then about 25 years ago that changed and information is now infinite. Our brains are not designed for it.3) Infinite information : highly constrained time, do the math: Now we must be choosy where we invest our limited funds. In fact, we must reject 99.999...% of information simply because of the information:time ratio.4) Sellers competing in that space, for your attention, have learned to push your emotional buttons every effectively; it&#x27;s hard to pull away. Learn to read that internal response as the feeling of BS and manipulation, of wasted time and future regret - you&#x27;re missing out, wasting your precious funds, and spinning your wheels: Even casual misinformation is a waste of time: feeling sick, you look up your symptoms and read some social media and follow the misinformation; the next day you&#x27;re no healthier (or you&#x27;re worse); you&#x27;ve done nothing. 99.9% of information is BS - it&#x27;s that bad, really; our brains can&#x27;t seem to comprehend it, but it&#x27;s true (imho). And of the remaining 0.01%, you don&#x27;t have time for 99.9% of even that.5) You have better things to do, much better things. The availability of extremely high value (EHV) knowledge, the top 0.0..1%, also has been transformed: You can access almost all of it, the best of almost any human, any place and any time, almost immediately; you don&#x27;t nearly have time for it all. Imagine having investments with enormous returns, far more such investments than you have money for - that&#x27;s the situation with your limited time and EHV knowledge. Why would you even spend a moment considering lesser investments? The high value information is beautiful; it&#x27;s stirring; it transforms your vision of the world (don&#x27;t settle for less!); the insights fly beyond your vision or conception; it&#x27;s breathtaking to see - and to see another human perform it; and it&#x27;s actually pretty true, which is not an easy thing to do....Be goal-oriented not reactive. Grow, don&#x27;t survive (surviving is treading water - or spinning your wheels). It feels like I&#x27;ve created a neural pathway where I feel like I don&#x27;t have enough time for the beautiful, EHV stuff; and time spent on anything less is resented, wasted, tries my patience. I feel like my time for such wonderful things is passing me by. (Of course I also have other needs and do other things.)(By EHV, I mean read Plato or MLK or Einstein the seminal papers and books in modern AI. Don&#x27;t read someone&#x27;s social media hot-take about them or their topics; don&#x27;t even read a professional&#x27;s interpretation; life is far too short. Read the Torah or Quran or Gospels. Look at the books and art that has transformed domains or the world. Hurry - you are missing out.)Also, a bit tangentially: Don&#x27;t let current social norms, the current tides, limit you. This knowledge and beauty is eternal; the truth was the truth yesterday, when everyone accepted it; is the truth today when they ridicule it; and it will be the truth again tomorrow when they&#x27;ve moved on. reply tomjen3 17 hours agoprevThis is a big part of it, but I don&#x27;t buy that the problem is disinformation - from the couple of times I have seen it Twitters community notes works pretty well for that.And we need to be better at ignoring things, sure.But my theory is that the real problem isn&#x27;t that people don&#x27;t know to evaluate something for truth, it is that they are not interested in truth in the first place - they are interested in things that reinforce their believes.

Patil, Kevin Lin, Sarah Wooders, Joseph E. Gonzalez Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at this https URL.

Thanks to the OP for posting, and for all the interest and feedback. To clarify a few points: the goal of this work is to investigate the extent to which an LLM can manage memory and different memory hierarchies, applying lessons from operating systems to extend effective context lengths. All of our code is open sourced at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpacker&#x2F;MemGPT so you can try it out yourselves! reply pacjam 1 hour agoparentUpdate - we just released a Discord perpetual chatbot implemented on top of MemGPT, you can try it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;9GEQrxmVyEYou can also run the chatbot demo + a doc QA bot demo (where you can ask MemGPT about API docs) locally with the code on GitHub. reply quickthrower2 56 minutes agorootparentThanks!

I posted this as a separate comment but would be curious about your response directly.What do you think about the tradeoff of having an agent manage its own memory as opposed to having a separate agent whose job it is to manage the memory and the other agent just focuses on the conversation? reply pacjam 5 hours agorootparentThanks for your interest!

And that&#x27;s before we talk about bugs. reply ansc 28 minutes agorootparentNot to even mention the heat death of the universe! reply a1j9o94 6 hours agoprevThis is super interesting! I was thinking about how to approach a similar problem for a project I&#x27;m working on, and my approach is similar.I am curious about the benefit of having the agent interact with the user (or doing the task) and managing its memory instead of having an observer agent that modifies the memory separately. The thought process is to let the agent use all of its tokens to focus on the task and not memory management. reply pacjam 6 hours agoparentExplicit memory management (MemGPT-style) vs implicit&#x2F;external memory management is an interesting tradeoff. Like you said, adding all the instructions on how to manage memory consumes ~1k tokens (using the default prompts on our MemGPT GitHub release), which is a lot when your context window is 8k. Additionally, it requires the base LLM to be very good at instruction following; gpt-4 can do it well, but it&#x27;s much more difficult to get explicit memory management to work with gpt-3.5-turbo or llama2 70b finetunes (so to build a robust system, you may have to end up having to \"split\" the thinking out of necessity).One of the main benefits of explicit memory management is simplicity - e.g., you don&#x27;t have to manage logic between a \"memory creation\" thread and a \"dialogue thread\". The explicit approach also integrates well with the iterative paging&#x2F;retrieval for document analysis we demo in the paper&#x2F;on GitHub. reply quickthrower2 1 hour agoprevBeen thinking about this. My naive way to do this using existing LLMs is to have a JSON the LLM can spit out when it wants to store and then then calling code shoves that in a “RAG” DB. It also has the ability to generate queries if it’s knowledge. reply pacjam 12 minutes agoparentThis is similar to how our external context is implemented under the hood - you might be interested in our perpetual chat bot example in the GitHub repo (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cpacker&#x2F;MemGPT), the message traces in the demo GIF should give you an idea of how things work at a glance. reply skrebbel 4 hours agoprevSorry if this is a bit meta but why is it so popular and accepted to Just Say Stuff in AI land? Sometimes it seems to me that AI people have begun hallucinating as much as the models they’re training.This article seems pretty cool but in no way has it anything to do with its title. “Operating system” has a clearly defined meaning and it’s not “a thing that has memory”. To me these kinds of grandiose claims with no substance undermine the credibility of the authors.I mean what’s wrong with “Tiered memory layers to provide extended AI context windows”? reply lgessler 2 hours agoparentIMO, as an NLP researcher, it&#x27;s a product of the \"fast science\" culture of AI where there are more papers than anyone could possibly read even in a given subfield at a particular conference, and an \"old\" paper is anything that was published over two years ago. (Who knew Bollywood movies and AI publications would have so much in common?) Maybe there are good reasons why publications should move so much more quickly in AI as opposed to, say, scholastic philosophy, but it&#x27;s undeniable that it has become a struggle to get others to even read an abstract of your work, and as such we should not be surprised when sensationalization verges on becoming a requirement for your work to get engagement.So to answer your question--perhaps cynically--“Tiered memory layers to provide extended AI context windows” is not the best title you could have for an AI paper because it has all the rizz of a shipping manifest. If you want to maximize citations, you need to market more.I also considered whether to blame the field&#x27;s very young reviewer population for not having the proper disdain for sensationalization that I&#x27;d expect from an older researcher who would surely have more restraint than to speak so much more of the sizzle than of the steak, but then I remembered that the paper which introduced the Transformer model was titled \"Attention Is All You Need\". reply isoprophlex 4 hours agoparentprevThe NFT&#x2F;web3&#x2F;shitcoin grifters had their bubble burst, so now they&#x27;re gravitating towards AI. reply kalium-xyz 3 hours agorootparentThey already owned the video cards.

If MemGPT is as spectacular as you suggest then I think an honest, down to earth title would have gotten you a lot more attention. It seems to me that limited context windows are one of the key roadblocks to wider real-world LLM applicability, beyond demos that do well on Twitter I mean. reply selestify 1 hour agorootparent> If MemGPT is as spectacular as you suggest then I think an honest, down to earth title would have gotten you a lot more attention.The fact that the current title got onto the HN front page suggests otherwise when it comes to incentives for picking submission titles. reply ludwik 3 hours agorootparentprevI think a title like \"MemGPT: Operating System inspired memory management for LLMs\" would be okay.

We programmed it to perform these calculations. It’s actually rather straightforward elementary mathematics.But, what happens is so many interdependent calculations grow the complexity of the problem until we are unable to hold it in it our minds, and to analyze its decisions computationally necessitates similar levels of computation for each decision being made as what was used to compute the weights.As for its effectiveness, familiarity with the field of computational complexity points to high dimensional polynomial optimization problems being broadly universal solvers. reply beoberha 8 hours agorootparentprevUnless you’re using an LLM to fly a plane, your analogy is a woefully bad comparison. reply TerrifiedMouse 8 hours agorootparentI guess my point is, if we don’t understand it, we don’t know its failure scenarios. reply jackgolding 7 hours agorootparentThis is the case with all neural nets&#x2F;black box AI models and a lot are used in various industries. reply tayo42 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat things are not understood about transformers? reply aik 7 hours agorootparentAll the uses reply omarfarooq 8 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s an LLM for that. reply mistermann 8 hours agorootparentprevDepends what \"operating system\" means.

What exactly do you think it does? reply hereforcomments 6 hours agoprevThere will be a Hackathon at work and with my team mate we are preparing with some kind of hierarchical memory&#x2F;knowledge solution.Briefly: we tell ChatGPT what API based tools we have, explaines them in 1 sentence and where it can reach their documentation. We added documentations as endpoint. example.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;main is always the starting point that returns high level overview of the app and all available endpoints to call. Every endpoint has its own documentation as well. E.g.: &#x2F;geocoder has &#x2F;docs&#x2F;geocoder documentation endpoint that describes what it does, what input it expects and what it will return.We also provieded ChatGPT with actions like read_docs, call_endpoint and end_conversation. An action is a structured JSON object with a set of parameters. If ChatGPT wants to interact with the mentioned resources, it emits an action, it gets executed and the answer fed back to it.With this I can do a task like: \"Get a 30 minutes drivetime polygon around 15 Bond Street, London and send it to Foster.\"It plans and executes the following all alone. First it calls the geocoder to get the coordinates for the isochrone endpoint, then gets the isochrone by calling the isochrone endpoint and saves it, calls Microsoft Graph API and queries my top 50 connections to find out who Foster is and calls the MS Graph API&#x27;s send mail endpoint to send the email with attachment to Foster.It can hierarchically explore the available resources so we don&#x27;t need a huge context window and we don&#x27;t have to train the model either. Also we could implement multiple agents. 1 would be a manager and there could me multiple agents to perform each task and return the results to the manager. It would furthet reduce reduce the required context window.Very likely some BS app will win the Hackathon like always like a market price predictor using Weka&#x27;s multilayer perceptron with default settings but we believe our solution could be extremely powerful. reply a1j9o94 6 hours agoparentThis is interesting. Can you expand on how this gets around the context window problem? Are you thinking the agent does a one-off task rather than continuing back and forth with the user?I do think this will be way less than having all of the functions listed to begin with though. I think the discoverability is a novel approach. Honestly, I&#x27;m surprised ChatGPT with plugins doesn&#x27;t do something like this by default rather than making you pick which plugins you want at the beginning of the conversation. reply hereforcomments 5 hours agorootparentFirst, the discoverability reduces the required context window. We don&#x27;t have to explain every app we have, it&#x27;s enough to tell ChatGPT one sentence about them and it will go deeper if it thinks that would help it to perform the task.Also, we have not implemented it, we can have one or multiple level of managers just like at a company and each would delegate a task to a worker (who could also be a manager) and they would report back the result. Just like in real life, a manager doesn&#x27;t have to know how something is done, it should only know it&#x27;s done and the get the results.We work for a large company and very likely have 100s of apps. We could build wrappers around them e.g. using selenium and we could interact with even old apps.We could also do the same approach with databases. The db itself would have docs, each table and each field as well. So we could ask ChatGPT to query data from the db and it could fully understand the data before writing the sql query. reply novax81 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve written about some hierarchical manager system with some friends when exploring how to use AI for larger set tasks. While the easy answer is simply using something with much larger context - `Claude` is amazing with an API key if you&#x27;re on the waitlist - we definitely followed the same idea of splitting up the context into individual groups.We had some success actually with layering another AI into the mix - having one AI look at a summary version of the context as a whole, and decide which pieces of context to assign to each manager. This of course requires a sidestep into another database of some kind to store the \"master context\" (AKA the full conversation, so you likely already have it in some form of storage), and of course a lot more calls to the AI which overall increases latency quite a bit.1. Use an AI to provide a short summary of each piece of logical context and map it by access ID 2. Use another AI to determine which pieces contain the most useful additional context to the piece of the task being evaluated 3.

Their abstract does a better job at explaining what they actually do, and where the connection with an OS comes in:> To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. reply pacjam 6 hours agoparentprevHey OP, thank you for the post.

    "originBody": "NEWS ▼ CONTACT SUBSCRIBE ‘Terminating Internet Access over Piracy Claims is Drastic and Overbroad’ October 14, 2023 by Ernesto Van der Sar HOME > LAWSUITS > REPEAT INFRINGER > Internet provider Grande Communications hopes to overturn a jury verdict that awarded $47 million in piracy damages to several record labels. The ISP is supported by several telecom industry groups, who all object to disconnecting subscribers' internet access based on copyright claims. A recent Supreme Court ruling in favor of Twitter plays a key role too. Last year, a Texas federal jury found Grande Communications liable for willful contributory copyright infringement and ordered the ISP to pay $47 million in damages to a group of record labels. The ISP was held liable for infringing 1,403 copyrighted songs, as it failed to terminate persistent pirates’ internet access. District Court Judge David Ezra confirmed the judgment in January. This prompted the ISP to request a do-over but that motion was ultimately declined. As a result, Grande took the matter to the appeals court. Grande Appeals Last month, Grande filed its opening brief in which it again argued that the lower court reached the wrong conclusion. Internet providers shouldn’t be held liable for pirating customers based on third-party allegations, the company argues. “This appeal presents important questions of first impression in this Circuit about whether, and in what circumstances, an internet service provider may be held secondarily liable for the conduct of users of its service,” the ISP writes. The ISP believes that it shouldn’t have to terminate Internet access this easily. This view is bolstered by a recent Supreme Court decision in favor of Twitter and other social media platforms, which held that they’re not liable for terrorist messages. Grande is not alone in this appeal. The company is supported by several telecoms organizations, through a joint amicus curiae brief submitted by broadband association USTelecom and the the CTIA, which represents wireless providers. Terminating Internet Access a Basic Measure? According to Grande, the District Court went too far when it informed the jury that a provider can be found liable for contributory infringement if it didn’t take “basic measures” to terminate accounts of repeat infringers. According to Grande, this strong language lacks nuance. The ISP notes that the ‘basic measures’ theory first emerged more than two decades ago in the Napster lawsuit. In that case, however, Napster failed to remove pirated tracks from its servers, while ISPs only pass on bits and bytes. “The ‘simple measures’ or ‘basic measures’ theory has its roots in the Labels’ case against Napster. […] Before filing suit, the Labels notified Napster of specific infringing files available on Napster’s service, but Napster declined to remove them.” The common feature of these cases is that the ‘simple measures’ standard has only been applied to defendants who directly control online content. That is because those defendants can readily remove or disable access to specific infringing content. The amici support this argument while going into more detail on how Internet terminations can affect the public. They believe that Internet terminations should not be taken lightly. ‘Drastic and Overbroad’ USTelecom and CTIA point out that terminating Internet access can have a negative impact beyond the alleged wrongdoers. It could impact entire households, coffee shops, offices, schools, libraries, or hospitals. That doesn’t qualify as a “basic measure”. “Termination thus prevents everyone — in a household, coffee shop, office, school, library, or hospital — who relies on a shared internet connection from using the internet for any purpose, whether remote work, accessing educational or health resources, seeking news or other information, or for entertainment. “It is instead a drastic and overbroad remedy, with severe consequences for non-infringers. Yet the district court’s approach could compel internet service providers to engage in wide-scale terminations to avoid facing crippling damages, like the $1 billion judgment entered against Cox Communications,” the amici add. These terminations take place with no judicial oversight and run contrary to the initiatives of lawmakers, who freed up billions of dollars to invest in American broadband infrastructure. “It would also create massive disincentives for providers to invest in the new broadband networks that Congress recognizes are needed to close the digital divide,” the telecoms groups note. Supreme Court’s Terrorist Ruling Grande’s appeal also draws heavily on the aforementioned Twitter vs. Taamneh ruling, in which the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that the social media platforms aren’t liable for ISIS terrorists, who used their services to recruit and raise funds. The Supreme Court rejected the claim that Twitter and others aided and abetted terrorist activity, because it didn’t “consciously and culpably” participate in the illegal activity. According to Grande, Internet providers are even further distanced from any wrongdoing. “The pleaded allegations in Twitter are illuminating. There, the plaintiffs alleged that Twitter, Facebook, and Google allowed ISIS to upload videos and messages for public display, and that they actively delivered ISIS’s posts to other users based on those users’ information and use history. “The social media companies failed to remove known ISIS accounts, instead letting ISIS benefit from the companies’ recommendation algorithms…” The Supreme Court ultimately concluded that the social media companies didn’t engage in purposeful, culpable conduct. Instead, they simply offered their “infrastructure” to the parties. In addition, the Supreme Court suggested that ISPs are even further removed. “[W]e generally do not think that internet or cell service providers incur culpability merely for providing their services to the public writ large,” the Supreme Court wrote. The telecoms groups bring up the same case and stress that the Supreme Court ruling suggests that it was an error by the court to hold Grande liable for pirating subscribers. As such, the appeal court should overturn it. Needless to say, the music companies will have a different take on the matter. They also made this clear when Cox brought up the Twitter ruling a few weeks ago and will likely do the same here. — A copy of Grande’s appeal brief can be found here (pdf) and the amicus curiae submission from USTelecom, The Broadband Association and CTIA is available here (pdf) Next Post Previous Post Tagged In: grande Grande Communications You Might Also Like: LAWSUITS Internet Provider Must Pay $47m Bond to Appeal Piracy Liability Judgment July 29, 2023, 21:28 by Ernesto Van der Sar LAWSUITS Reddit Asks Court to Protect Users Right to Anonymous Speech in Piracy Case July 7, 2023, 11:24 by Ernesto Van der Sar PIRACY Filmmakers Take Reddit to Court Again to Unmask ‘Piracy’ Commenters June 21, 2023, 20:42 by Ernesto Van der Sar Submit a correction or tip.

As they argue, what&#x27;s going to happen when an isp shuts off service to a hospital due to automated systems put in place to mitigate this ruling? Mistakes can be corrected in due time, but how much damage will be done in the interim?It&#x27;s so exhausting that we don&#x27;t just commit to net neutrality. It&#x27;s the obvious logistical answer to this with direct comparisons in telephone service. Should have been settled years ago, but for some reason were letting the corporate copyright class spend money to slow it down. reply dgrin91 20 hours agoparentTypically most institutions such as hospitals have multi T1 lines from separate providers. Ignoring piracy&#x2F;automated systems, sometimes isps just have outages, so it&#x27;s the same problem. reply doubleg72 8 hours agorootparentNo, Verizon phased out T1 which is now PRI handoff via fiber.

Well, it&#x27;s possible, but at 50% or so capacity (and I&#x27;m sure that number is going up)A hospital filled up assuming 100% capacity that falls back to 50% capacity, however is going to be VERY tough to keep running for the doctors. reply profile53 16 hours agorootparentA lot of these systems are locally hosted on hospital infrastructure to guarantee that when internet service goes out, medical records can still be accessed. And I cannot name many hospital medical devices that are Internet connected, rather than just connected to a local Intranet. reply sp332 20 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think this is related to net neutrality. reply em-bee 20 hours agorootparentit is related in the sense that ISPs have no business or should not be burdened with policing the data their customers transfer. if someone violates the law it is up to the courts to prosecute them and if appropriate deny them internet access. however given that internet access is now as important as a phone used to be, this should practically never happen. reply tpmoney 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s worth pointing out that society is shifting HARD on the idea that pipe service providers should be \"neutral\" with respect to the traffic they&#x27;re carrying. Recent pushes around scam calls and texts have resulted in policies with providers to more heavily screen their customers from the start, requirements for text campaigns to submit their content for review, internal evaluation of traffic for fraud patterns and dropping it before it gets to the end point, enforcement of the \"STOP\" thing for texts, and even things like STIR&#x2F;SHAKEN which while not specifically about the content of the message (other than the caller id info) still involves each layer asserting what degree of \"trust\" they give what they&#x27;re carrying.Realistically every time you see someone lamenting that telecoms aren&#x27;t dropping scam callers and texts and policing that better, you&#x27;re seeing an advocation against net&#x2F;carrier neutrality. reply hn_acker 18 hours agorootparent> Realistically every time you see someone lamenting that telecoms aren&#x27;t dropping scam callers and texts and policing that better, you&#x27;re seeing an advocation against net&#x2F;carrier neutrality.I agree based on the strict definition of net neutrality but disagree based on implementation in practice. Spam can be made an exception to net neutrality laws.I do think that phone service providers and internet service providers should be common carriers, but letting phone service providers drop spam callers is socially compatible with banning service providers from dropping calls from my hypothetical family member who is a terrorist on death row: some kinds of calls - such as phone calls from family members, work colleagues&#x2F;managers, friends once removed, etc. - are the kinds of calls which people tacitly mutually agree to receive. I would want phone service providers to turn a blind eye to calls between people with a social relation. Spam calls, on the other hand, are unsolicited calls usually from strangers with no social relation to the receiver. (How to identify spam is a different question, but I&#x27;m only arguing about the motivating principles.) The same applies to fraud, which some spam is (your car&#x27;s extended warranty, etc.).With internet websites, the user usually wants the traffic they request from the website. So ISPs should not be allowed to voluntarily restrict such traffic, and government bodies should be prohibited (with very narrow exceptions) from making ISPs restrict traffic. Where government bodies could instead put penalties on users and website owners, governments should not also target ISPs. (Privacy-violating third-party elements such as ads are not always wanted by the user, but that can be solved with privacy laws rather than exceptions to common carrier laws.) reply tpmoney 14 hours agorootparent>Spam can be made an exception to net neutrality laws.Sure, spam can be an exception. And so can fraud, and terrorism. And then so can piracy, and porn, and drug content. And once we&#x27;re back into the exceptions for \"immoral\" content, the world is our oyster and nothing is off limits for the sake of the children.For any neutrality to work it must be completely neutral with respect to 100% of content. If providers are not to be involved in regulating the content that goes over the wires they provide, that must be held to the furthest extent possible. Spam, piracy and everything else that society decides it doesn&#x27;t like MUST be dealt with another way that is entirely divorced from requiring or allowing providers to get in the middle of it. Anything else isn&#x27;t neutrality, it&#x27;s just conveniently aligned with your current interests, which may or may not be a stable situation. reply hn_acker 11 hours agorootparentI should have been better about my word choice. In my previous comment, I shouldn&#x27;t have lumped phone carriers in with ISPs, since the net neutrality debate in 2017 was not about phones, and calling&#x2F;texting service is different from internet service. When I mentioned spam in my previous comment, I was referring only to spam calls and spam text messages, not spam websites. Consider my previous comment overriden by what I write in this comment.In this comment, when I say \"net neutrality\", I am referring to internet service providers, and internet service provided over cellular service but not the other aspects of phone service. I think that net neutrality should have a few specific exceptions, but spam is not one of them.With the two exceptions I&#x27;ll mention later, governments should not restrict access to websites if users request the content (most website visits).Terrorism, piracy, porn, drug, and non-malware spam websites fall under this category for adults. (Children are a separate matter, but parents and caretakers bear the responsibility of managing childrens&#x27; internet and phone usage.) Porn is off-limits to government restrictions due to the First Amendment. In the cases of piracy, terrorism, illegal drugs, and non-malware spam, governments can target the website operators for their crimes (not for their websites, excepting CSAM) and shut down the websites directly without asking ISPs to do anything other than provide information in response to court orders. I&#x27;m not sure how to categorize fraud websites, but non-malware fraud can be corrected after the government deals with the fraudsters, so I&#x27;ll lump non-malware fraud with these previous kinds of content. My model of net neutrality is that ISPs can look at the content, but they must turn a blind eye to the previously listed categories. Which data ISPs can collect, retain, and share with the government is something for privacy laws to decide. (No sharing with non-governmental parties.)So governments should not be allowed to pressure ISPs to restrict traffic nor force ISPs to even identify it, except if the traffic in question goes to&#x2F;from a website that spreads CSAM or tries to visitors&#x27; computers with malware. CSAM is firmly outside of the First Amendment (while terrorism-related speech is ambiguous in legality), and malware is much more time-sensitive than the above kinds of content. Governments should be able to force ISPs to report identified CSAM. Malware, I&#x27;m leaning toward otherwise because I don&#x27;t know whether the federal government would bother telling affected citizens about it.Regarding phone carriers:Websites receive automatically and are quiet unless configured to be otherwise. The user requests a webpage, and the server sends it. Unlike websites, phone calls interrupt the receivers and force the receiver to check the caller. Spam calls are intrusive in a way that doesn&#x27;t apply to spam websites, so I&#x27;m okay with government regulations of spam calls where I&#x27;m not okay with comparable regulations of spam websites.My ideal would be for phone carriers to do block spam calls voluntarily, but that hasn&#x27;t worked out so far. So my idea is to force phone carriers to identify spam numbers (of both spam callers and spam texters) and to give users the option to delegate blocking of spam numbers to the phone carrier. If the user doesn&#x27;t want the carrier to block spam, then that&#x27;s that, though the user can still rely on third-party spam services such as Google&#x27;s. reply josephcsible 12 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t STIR&#x2F;SHAKEN analogous to reverse path filtering? Is that also a violation of net neutrality? reply hn_acker 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not net neutrality, but it is conceptually related. Net neutrality is the principle that an ISP should treat internet traffic equally regardless of content, sender, or receiver [1]. Put another way, ISPs should not have the discretion to restrict internet traffic or internet access. If your personal concept of net neutrality is limited to an ISPs voluntary decisions, then the court case in the article is merely adjacent to net neutrality.On the other hand, I believe that the principle of net neutrality should extend to US governments: for the most part, governments should not be allowed to restrict internet traffic or internet access.1. Internet traffic is speech and expression. The First Amendment makes freedom of expression the default.2. Internet access is increasingly necessary for work, school, politics beyond a local level, and getting internet access. See appendix A for bonus information.3. Internet users and websites usually are the people who decide what traffic the users see, government interventions over the content (regarding such as CSAM and copyright infringement) should directly sue users and website owners (and not ISPs), because lawsuits to ISPs rather than to ISP users are less visible to those users and therefore less likely to attract the users&#x27; opposition.4. Letting a government block internet access even for a reason like copyright infringement is a slippery slope toward willful blindness to false positives and excessive punishments. See appendix C for bonus info.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Net_neutralityEverything below this line is bonus.Appendix A: Regarding my earlier claim that Internet access is \"increasingly necessary\": Seeking a sufficiently paying job, never mind working, is hard without internet. Students need internet to get emails, use online learning management systems, collaborate, video call, etc. Fact checking what you read&#x2F;hear offline or see&#x2F;hear via internet-less TV about politics beyond a local level is impossible. (Asking a friend to do it for you on the internet is not allowed in this thought experiment.) Getting internet access requires contacting an ISP in the first place, and getting the phone number without visiting the ISPs website is hard without internet.Appendix B: The net neutrality debate in 2017 was actually a debate about the FCC&#x27;s entire authority to protect consumers in the internet access market [B1].> A big part of the FCC’s plan involves rolling back the FCC’s tailor-made authority over broadband providers, then shoveling all remaining government oversight to an FTC ill-equipped to handle it.> Why is that a problem? The FTC has no rule-making ability, and can only move to protect consumers after a violation has occurred. And that action can only occur if it’s painfully clear that an ISP engaged in “unfair and deceptive” behavior, something that’s easy for an ISP to dodge in the net neutrality era, where anti-competitive behavior is often buried under faux-technical jargon and claims that it was done only for the health and safety of the network.And let&#x27;s be clear, internet access remains mostly the same since 2017 (deceptively priced, overpriced, slow, not fiber, data capped, not available in rural places) because states passed net neutrality laws [B2].[B1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;yw5d5g&#x2F;net-neutrality-big-te...[B2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.techdirt.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;28&#x2F;courts-again-shoot-down-...Appendix C: Orrin Hatch wants to destroy the computers of people who commit copyright infringement [C1]. (I kept the Wikipedia bracket citations in the quote so that you can control-F for each paragraph in the original article.)> Hatch was long a proponent of expanding intellectual property rights and in 1997 introduced the Senate version of the Copyright Term Extension Act.[89] Hatch believed that intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators.[89]> Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003, by proposing that copyright owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of copyright infringement, including file sharing, he stated that \"This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.\"[90] In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch&#x27;s official website was using an unlicensed JavaScript menu from United Kingdom-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that \"We&#x27;ve had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.\" Shortly after the publication of that story in Wired magazine, the company that runs Hatch&#x27;s website contacted Milonic to start registration.[C1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Orrin_Hatch#Intellectual_prope... reply doubleg72 8 hours agoparentprevWe would switch over to the other ISP reply lukevp 18 hours agoprevSafe Harbor in DMCA does say that repeat infringers should be terminated from service. I do think it’s government overreach because for many, you only have one ISP as an option, and cutting you off from internet access is very severely impactful to many. This seems like a court matter directly between the copyright holders and the infringing end user.Perhaps I’m biased in this regard, not really sure how the law shakes out. I will say that Grande was an amazing ISP. I had them for probably 8 years before I moved out of Texas, and my boss for several years was a former Grande employee. Everyone had great things to say about them. One time, our internet went down during a historic flood, and they ended up flying a fiber line across the flooded river using a drone to get service back to everyone.

But we don&#x27;t. Too bad people need to eat and pay their rent.Lots of drugs cost little to manufacture but lots to develop. Ideally the costs for robust research and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals would be shared by all people equally because we all benefit from improving the human condition... But they&#x27;re not. And since pharmaceutical companies can&#x27;t just blow a whole bunch of money on research for things that will bring them no money, they charge enough for the pill to make their money back, and unfortunately, usually, far beyond that until it&#x27;s able to be made generically. I believe that windfall profits from prices that keep people from treatment are wrong. But allowing everyone to make new drugs developed by other pharmaceutical companies to sell at generic prices would just mean those companies wouldn&#x27;t research new drugs... Win? Not without a way in-place to replace that research. And anyone considering some glib argument questioning the value of new drugs, you&#x27;re full of shit. Not every new drug is a Viagra knock-off.Lots of people in the tech crowd have adopted this convenient romantic notion that real art must be non-commercial, and that all real art is made by people toiling in obscurity, driven solely by the need for self-expression and the distant hope that they&#x27;ll someday be discovered, become famous, and have their name in art history books... Or even that hobby art could replace professional art. That, of course, is complete bullshit. Art is no different than any other intellectual pursuit and equating VFX artists for AAA game titles and professional session musicians to weekend basement studio oil painters and people with hobby bands is like equating immigration attorneys writing depositions and technical writers to people who are serious about their personal fanfic blogs.Saying we need to abolish copyright means the things that are copyrighted have enough value to want; demanding we do that without first demanding an alternate way to support people who do intellectual work is a self-absorbed demand for free stuff. Saying they should get another job and continue to produce that valuable work for free— like a public slave in ancient Rome— is not an answer any ethical adult could entertain in good faith. reply Aurornis 20 hours agorootparentprev> Especially when there are enough creatives out there who do the work purely for passion that&#x27;d we&#x27;d never run out of media to consume even if nobody could use copyright to profit from it.“Because I think people should work for free to entertain me” reply logicchains 20 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not about what I think; it&#x27;s a fact that there&#x27;s an abundance of creative media produced by people not getting paid for it. reply Aurornis 19 hours agorootparentIf this was true, people wouldn’t try to pirate copyrighted content because they’d be busy with this supposed abundance of free creative media.People pirate because they want content that other people produced with the expectation of getting paid.People like getting paid for their work.

They can be licensed, but the physical creator of a work always owns the copyright. Disney can&#x27;t own copyright, only it&#x27;s artists and animators. They have to negotiate a license to distribute with everyone. The idea here is that if an idea continues to have value for a company, then it continues to have value to the person who created it. And if Disney or whoever decides that something isn&#x27;t worth having anymore, the creators are free to go out and find someone who does value it.Immediate concern here is how messy this gets deciding what anyone actually owns. Do animators own the copyright to a character jointly? Separately? Do they only own the copyrights to their specific drawings and a character is then inherently uncopyrightable? Joint ownership seems obvious, but then how is that any better for the individuals than Disney having exclusive ownership? It only takes one to prevent you from making money on your work. Separate but equal ownership seems interesting, but how much do you have to contribute to get that? Does everyone who ever drew a sketch for Lilo and Stitch now own the IP rights to the entire character? Likewise how would you keep licensing agreements from looking like convoluted versions of modern copyright anyway? I guess that&#x27;s more on the unions and guilds but if every employee signs a 200 year exclusive license, that&#x27;s not any different from what we have today really.2) Trademarks can not be sold. A trademark&#x27;s purpose is to assure a buyer of the source of a given good. The whole reason we protect them is because if I buy a product with Apple&#x27;s branding on it, I want to know I got it from Apple, not from \"Bob&#x27;s Fancy Electronics Shack and Bait Shop\". Problem is, if you can sell a trademark, you&#x27;ve changed who is actually the source of the good, but the consumer may not know that. Food items make a good example here. \"Uncle Roger&#x27;s Superior MSG\" might be a small company, but when Kraft buys them out, it&#x27;s not Uncle Roger who&#x27;s selling it anymore, it&#x27;s Kraft. And Kraft may change that recipe, or otherwise make decisions that Uncle Roger wouldn&#x27;t. A consumer should know it&#x27;s no longer \"Uncle Roger&#x27;s Superior MSG\" they&#x27;re buying, it&#x27;s now \"Kraft MSG\" and while it might be based on Uncle Roger&#x27;s recipe, it&#x27;s not from Uncle Roger and Kraft should have to rebrand it and fight for brand reputation all over again. Zombie brands are another example of this. Whoever is making Craftsman tools isn&#x27;t Sears and Roebuck anymore, and they&#x27;re not the same, and shouldn&#x27;t be sold as the same.Again there are some immediate concerns that come to mind. Part of the value of buying a company is that trademarks carry the reputation of the company. Distinguishing between a change of owners as part of the course of business and a change of owners as in a sale of the whole company is also difficult. I don&#x27;t think if \"Uncle Roger\" and \"Auntie Helen\" split and the 50&#x2F;50 ownership structure becomes 100% ownership, does that require a rebrand? Probably not, but then what are the limits of this? If Kraft sells Uncle Roger a 0.0001% ownership in Kraft, does that also mean there&#x27;s no need to rebrand? reply redwall_hp 15 hours agorootparent> Whoever is making Craftsman tools isn&#x27;t Sears and Roebuck anymoreIt never was. Sears, even many decades ago, always contracted other vendors to make their products, just like Costco does with their house brand now. The product numbers even used the first three digits to identify the vendor.A Kenmore appliance would be made by Whirlpool, Maytag, LG, Samsung, whatever. It would be a distinct product, with its own exterior design and feature set (rather than just changing a logo). It definitely was worth finding out who made which, to favor manufacturers like LG over Whirlpool.Craftsman was made by the Stanley&#x2F;Black&Decker&#x2F;DeWalt corporation for a long time before they finally bought the brand during the final Sears collapse a few years ago.Here&#x27;s the prefix list for appliances, but there are larger ones for all products: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.applianceaid.com&#x2F;sears-manufacturing-codes.phpI recall seeing references to companies like \"Tandy\" for some electronic products, which should indicate that this practice goes back well into the 70s and 80s... reply aleph_minus_one 13 hours agorootparentprev> 1) Copyrights can only be owned by natural persons and can not be transferred.

But no, the greed made them split up into a dozen different services nobody wants, and here we are again. reply awjlogan 20 hours agorootparentBecause you are getting something produced by someone for free if you pirate it and you are relying on others to fund your consumption. Take that to the logical extreme: everybody pirates everything. That is _very_ different to everyone not buying it. There is demand for the product and it has a cost to produce. If you steal something from somebody, there is recourse in law.I don&#x27;t disagree about the greed part, but I guess fragmentation is almost inevitable until the profit margin is driven down to near zero. Shortsighted, probably, but it would essentially require all the producers to back (and therefore yield profit to), one or two Netflix&#x2F;Spotify type entities. reply haswell 20 hours agorootparentTaking this to the logical extreme is fallacious. The piracy wars up to this point have already shown that people buy content if it’s reasonably priced, and that piracy in many cases actually increases sales of the original content. The fact that piracy is back in the limelight has everything to do with the failing business models of greedy companies, and is the market reacting accordingly.The fact that there are penalties for stealing physical goods does not imply that just any penalty is fine. The analogy doesn’t work. Removal of Internet access in 2023 is debilitating. Punishments are supposed to fit the crime, and the complete loss of access to what has become a fundamental point of access does not fit the crime.And there’s also the very old arguments that I won’t rehash here about the clear difference between digital copies of content and physical items. reply awjlogan 20 hours agorootparentIf I don&#x27;t think a product in the shop is reasonably priced, I don&#x27;t have the right just to take it. The shop can decide to reduce the price in response to the market - they may make less profit than before and make up for it in volume. However, that is entirely their perogative.There is zero difference between a digital and physical item if you are the producer. A digital good has the cost of production front loaded, it just has next to zero marginal cost. That may be the cost of education and experience, for example. If you make something of value, you absolutely have the right to choose how you are rewarded - if the buyer decides that choice isn&#x27;t right for them, you can either change the offer or you look for your next customer. You may choose to give it away, if your reward is the satisfaction of someone using it, but that is your choice, not the consumer&#x27;s. reply logicchains 20 hours agorootparent>There is zero difference between a digital and physical item if you are the producerThere&#x27;s absolutely a difference. If you produce a physical good, and somebody takes it, you no longer have it. If you produce a digital good and somebody copies it, you still have the original, you&#x27;re still free to use and enjoy it as you see fit.Fundamentally property rights are a negative right: you have the right not to have your stuff taken. Negative rights don&#x27;t conflict with eachother, that&#x27;s why they make a good basis for society. Intellectual property is a positive right: you have the right to control how other people use their property, which conflicts with people&#x27;s right to use their property as they see fit. reply awjlogan 20 hours agorootparentIntellectual property is a response exactly to the difference in the marginal cost because it recognises the threat to the value creating producer. Just because you don&#x27;t tangibly see the cost of the IP, that doesn&#x27;t mean it was free to produce.You can absolutely argue that IP law is cynically applied, but in principle it protects high capital and low operating expense businesses from those who would like to do the low operating expense part without bothering about the high capital part. reply haswell 20 hours agorootparentprev> If I don&#x27;t think a product in the shop is reasonably priced, I don&#x27;t have the right just to take itWe need to collectively stop using these kinds of physical goods analogies in discussions about piracy. To claim that there is no difference is a fundamental miscalculation.To be clear, I do not condone piracy. I purchase the content that I view. But these kinds of fallacious analogies are misleading and dangerous to Internet freedom. reply awjlogan 20 hours agorootparentIn what way is it fallacious? Or dangerous? (That&#x27;s a genuine question).Fundamentally, it&#x27;s the same problem - producers have to adjust their prices to reflect the threat to their income. If I produce something, and I forecast X% of my overall market to be stolen, I have to adjust my selling price according. It doesn&#x27;t matter if that something is physical or digital.If I produce something that is digital I have the luxury of being able to reduce the cost as low as I like to capture as much value as I can, but that is still my choice as the producer. reply haswell 20 hours agorootparentThese arguments have been rehashed for decades at this point, and I think it’s best that I just link to an overview [0].The bottom line is it there is a lot of nuance here, and simple analogies that make one act appear to be the same as the other lead to some reductionist conclusions that have been repeatedly taken up by lawmakers who do not understand these nuances.-[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2015-04-downloading-ethics-digital-pir... reply awjlogan 19 hours agorootparentThank you for the link, appreciate the read and the nuance is important and I don&#x27;t at all believe in the fundamentalist view on either side. I&#x27;m in complete agreement that threatening someone with massive legal ramifications is not good, but I do believe that people who make things of value should be able to do so with proportionate recourse to law to protect their livelihood. Law is, of course, made (or at least moulded) by those with money&#x2F;influence so weighing the proportionality is the issue. reply haswell 17 hours agorootparentYeah, I agree. I don’t think people should be free to pirate with impunity, but I get very very uneasy when people trot out life ruining penalties (not saying you’re doing this).I’ve been transitioning away from a career in tech into creating educational content for a niche I love, and I’m sensitive to the need for recourse. At the same time, I think I’m far less likely as an individual creator to have much recourse because I don’t have a team of lawyers.This is the other aspect of these piracy discussions that always bothers me. It’s really the behemoths vs. individuals, which to me points at very misaligned thinking when it comes to the resulting policy&#x2F;laws. replybeej71 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you sell a table, I am absolutely free to pirate that table by going home and making a copy of it.

If I, as a lone actor, hook my tape deck into the output of my radio and \"steal\" the newest Britney Spears track have I normalized the act of piracy?If everyone is doing it then it does seem pretty normalized, but if everyone is doing it then your presumption as to society&#x27;s values seems flawed.In reality these media producers seem to be making healthy profits so perhaps internet piracy is not as normalized as you think. reply renzobanks 20 hours agorootparentprevI think the word piracy is worse honestly, because what it really means is to swashbuckle on the open seas. And i don&#x27;t think stealing physical goods or digital goods is quite comparable to that. reply shadowgovt 20 hours agorootparentprev> but I guess fragmentation is almost inevitable until the profit margin is driven down to near zeroPrecisely. You can&#x27;t just take stuff people made at cost, that&#x27;s violating copyright! You need to instead be a megacorporation that competes so brutally on intermediating yourself in the pipe that profit is driven towards zero, so you can&#x27;t afford to pay any artists!That&#x27;s the legal way to screw over creators. reply awjlogan 20 hours agorootparentBrutal, but true :&#x2F; reply MrVandemar 21 hours agorootparentprev\"Sell\"? They don&#x27;t sell anything anymore. You get a licence, revocable at any time. And you keep paying and paying and paying. reply ThePowerOfFuet 21 hours agorootparent>You get a licence, revocable at any time.And without refund. reply johngladtj 21 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t have a right to be paid. reply JopV 20 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t have a right to the fruits of other people&#x27;s labor. reply sp332 20 hours agorootparentHe who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper [candle] at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature.... Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property. --Thomas Jefferson reply JopV 19 hours agorootparentThat is about patents, not about copyright. Patents protect ideas&#x2F;inventions, and are controversial. Copyright protects works, and aside from what should happen with it if the author dies, is not really controversial. reply dml2135 20 hours agorootparentprevWhen the fruits of your labor are something that can be endlessly reproduced for nearly zero cost, I don’t think you have a very strong right to be paid.There is no scarcity in digital media. Supply and demand will inevitably drive down the price to near zero. replyk12sosse 19 hours agoprevYou wouldn&#x27;t pirate factorio, would you? reply swayvil 20 hours agoprevUBI would transform society. No longer would we push to protect income streams that we all know are a bit messed up but hey a man&#x27;s gotta eat. End this vast circus of crumb-snatching. reply tiahura 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been caught stealing Once when I was 5 I enjoy stealing It&#x27;s just as simple as that Well, it&#x27;s just a simple fact When I want something, I don&#x27;t want to pay for it I walk right through the door Walk right through the door Hey all right! If I get by, it&#x27;s mine reply Veuxdo 21 hours agoprev [–] ... not really? That&#x27;s a whole lot less drastic and overboard than serving a jail sentence for piracy, which can and does happen. reply c22 21 hours agoparentEven a jail sentence isn&#x27;t very drastic and overbroad when compared to the death penalty. reply ysavir 21 hours agorootparentMost sentences aren&#x27;t very drastic compared to the worst possible sentence. But how well lined up are they with the crime? reply c22 21 hours agorootparentExactly! reply sp332 20 hours agoparentprev [–] In the USA, it&#x27;s a civil violation, not a crime. You can&#x27;t go to jail for downloading. Uploading is what gets people in real trouble. Unfortunately bittorrent counts as uploading, which is ridiculous. Some people make a business of piracy and going after those people would be a little more reasonable. reply aidenn0 16 hours agorootparent [–] > Unfortunately bittorrent counts as uploading, which is ridiculousPiracy laws aside, I don&#x27;t see why BT counting as uploading is ridiculous; you are aiding in the distribution of the content just as much as if you had setup a public FTP server with the content on it. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
