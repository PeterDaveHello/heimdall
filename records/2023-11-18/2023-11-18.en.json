Search process underway to identify permanent successor. The board of directors of OpenAI, Inc., the 501(c)(3) that acts as the overall governing body for all OpenAI activities, today announced that Sam Altman will depart as CEO and leave the board of directors. Mira Murati, the company’s chief technology officer, will serve as interim CEO, effective immediately. A member of OpenAI’s leadership team for five years, Mira has played a critical role in OpenAI’s evolution into a global AI leader. She brings a unique skill set, understanding of the company’s values, operations, and business, and already leads the company’s research, product, and safety functions. Given her long tenure and close engagement with all aspects of the company, including her experience in AI governance and policy, the board believes she is uniquely qualified for the role and anticipates a seamless transition while it conducts a formal search for a permanent CEO. Mr. Altman’s departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI. In a statement, the board of directors said: “OpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity. The board remains fully committed to serving this mission. We are grateful for Sam’s many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI. At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward. As the leader of the company’s research, product, and safety functions, Mira is exceptionally qualified to step into the role of interim CEO. We have the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period.” OpenAI’s board of directors consists of OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, independent directors Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology’s Helen Toner. As a part of this transition, Greg Brockman will be stepping down as chairman of the board and will remain in his role at the company, reporting to the CEO. OpenAI was founded as a non-profit in 2015 with the core mission of ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. In 2019, OpenAI restructured to ensure that the company could raise capital in pursuit of this mission, while preserving the nonprofit's mission, governance, and oversight. The majority of the board is independent, and the independent directors do not hold equity in OpenAI. While the company has experienced dramatic growth, it remains the fundamental governance responsibility of the board to advance OpenAI’s mission and preserve the principles of its Charter.

Anybody old enough to remember the same &#x27;OMG its going to change the world&#x27; cycles around AI every two or three decades knows better. The field is not actually advancing. It still wrestles with the same fundamental problems they were doing in the early 60s. The only change is external, where computer power gains and data set size increases allow brute forcing problems. reply Eji1700 30 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;d say the biggest change is the quantity of available CATEGORIZED data. Tagged images and what not has done a ton to help the field.Further there are some hybrid chips which might help increase computing power specifically for the matrix math that all these systems work on.But yeah, none of this is making what people talk about when they say AGI. Just like how some tech cult people felt that Level 5 self driving was around the corner, even with all the evidence to the contrary.The self driving we have (or really, assisted cruise control) IS impressive, and leagues ahead of what we could do even a decade or two ago, but the gulf between that, and the goal, is similar to GPT and AGI in my eyes.There are a lot of fundamental problems we still don&#x27;t have answers to. We&#x27;ve just gotten a lot better at doing what we already did, and getting more conformity on how. reply Closi 2 hours agorootparentprevMainly because LLMs have so far basically passed every formal test of ‘AGI’ including totally smashing the Turing test.Now we are just reliant on ‘I’ll know it when I see it’.LLMs as AGI isn’t about looking at the mechanics and trying to see if we think that could cause AGI - it’s looking at the tremendous results and success. reply peyton 55 minutes agorootparentIt’s trivial to trip up chat LLMs. “What is the fourth word of your answer?” reply ben_w 46 minutes agorootparentgot-3.5 got that right for me; I&#x27;d expect it to fail if you&#x27;d asked for letters, but even then that&#x27;s a consequence of how it was tokenised, not a fundamental limit of transformer models. reply rezonant 37 minutes agorootparentThis sort of test has been my go-to trip up for LLMs, and 3.5 fails quite often. 4 has been as bad as 3.5 in the past but recently has been doing better. reply gardenhedge 1 hour agorootparentprevSince ChatGPT is not indistinguishable from a human during a chat, is it fair to say it smashes the Turing test? Or do you mean something different? reply aidaman 48 minutes agorootparentnot yet: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2310.20216that being said, it is highly intelligent, capable of reasoning as well as a human, and passes IQ tests like GMAT and GRE at levels like the 97th percentile.most people who talk about Chat GPT don&#x27;t even realize that GPT 4 exists and is orders of magnitude more intelligent than the free version. reply NoOn3 48 minutes agorootparentprevChatGPT is distinguishable from a human, because ChatGPT never responds \"I don&#x27;t know.\", at least not yet. :) reply ben_w 42 minutes agorootparentIt can do: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;f1c0726f-294d-447d-a3b3-f664dc...IMO the main reason it&#x27;s distinguishable is because it keeps explicitly telling you it&#x27;s an AI. reply rezonant 33 minutes agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t the same thing. This is a commanded recital of a lack of capability, not that its confidence in it&#x27;s answer is low. For a type of question the GPT _could_ answer, most of the time it _will_ answer, regardless of accuracy reply NoOn3 27 minutes agorootparentprevI just noticed that when I ask really difficult technical questions, but for which there is an exact answer, It often tries to answer plausibly, but incorrectly instead of answering \"I don&#x27;t know\". But over time, It becomes smarter and there are fewer and fewer such questions... reply ben_w 24 minutes agorootparentHave you tried setting a custom instruction in settings?

I think it&#x27;s hyperbole, but basically what he is saying is that it&#x27;s difficult for the company to grow because the tech is limited by the training costs danpalmer 4 minutes agorootparentprevNo. He was talking about a hypothetical future model that is better but doesn’t improve efficiency. reply gardenhedge 1 hour agorootparentprevNonsense really reply dannykwells 7 hours agoparentprevThis should be higher voted. Seems like an internal power struggle between the more academic types and the commercial minded sides of OpenAI.I bet Sam goes and founds a company to take on OpenAI…and wins. reply thomassmith65 6 hours agorootparentYes, and wins with an inferior product.

There is always a tension between technical and commercial. That’s a battle that should be fought daily, but never completely won.This looks like a terrible decision, but I suppose we must wait and see. reply ytoawwhra92 3 hours agorootparentOpenAI is a non-profit research organisation.It&#x27;s for-profit (capped-profit) subsidiary exists solely to be able to enable competitive compensation to its researchers to ensure they don&#x27;t have to worry about the opportunity costs of working at a non-profit.They have a mutually beneficial relationship with a deep-pocketed partner who can perpetually fund their research in exchange for exclusive rights to commercialize any ground-breaking technology they develop and choose to allow to be commercialized.Aggressive commercialization is at odds with their raison d&#x27;être and they have no need for it to fund their research. For as long as they continue to push forward the state of the art in AI and build ground-breaking technology they can let Microsoft worry about commercialization and product development.If a CEO is not just distracting but actively hampering an organisation&#x27;s ability to fulfill its mission then their dismissal is entirely warranted. reply dagaci 58 minutes agorootparentIt seems Microsoft was totally blind-sided by this event. If true then Trillion$+ Microsoft will now be scruitinizing the unpredictability and organizational risk associated with being dependant on the \"unknown-random\" + powrerful + passionate Illya and board who are vehemently opposed to the trajectory lead by altman. One solution would be to fork OpenAI and its efforts, one side with the vision lead by Illya and the other Sam. reply RuggedPineapple 2 hours agorootparentprevEven a non-profit needs to focus on profitability, otherwise it&#x27;s not going to exist for very long. All &#x27;non-profit&#x27; means is it&#x27;s prohibited from distributing its profit to shareholders. Ownership of a non-profit doesn&#x27;t pay you. The non-profit itself still wants and is trying to generate more then it spends. reply ytoawwhra92 2 hours agorootparentI addressed that concern in my third paragraph. reply lll-o-lll 41 minutes agorootparentprevThanks for that, it’s both interesting and informative. I still think my point stands. This is not a pure non-profit and the tension between commercial and research is both inevitable and necessary.Let’s see how this plays out over the coming weeks. If we see an exodus of senior technical staff, then the conclusion will be that the board have made a significant error. reply fuzztester 1 hour agorootparentprev>They have a mutually beneficial relationship with a deep-pocketed partner who can perpetually fund their research in exchange for exclusive rights to commercialize any ground-breaking technology they develop and choose to allow to be commercialized.Isn&#x27;t this already a conflict of interest, or a clash, with this:>OpenAI is a non-profit research organisation.? reply logifail 54 minutes agorootparent> ?\"OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-openai reply satvikpendem 3 hours agorootparentprevAs long as truly \"open\" AI wins, as in fully open-source AI, then I&#x27;m fine with such a \"leadership transition.\" reply aidaman 42 minutes agorootparentthis absolutely will not happen, Ilya is against it reply baq 0 minutes agorootparentYeah if you think a misused AGI is like a misused nuclear weapon, you might think it’s a bad idea to share the recipe for either. dmix 4 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re putting a lot of trust in the power of one man, who easily could have the power to influence the three other board members.

Not yet anyway. The utility is in the usefulness of the AI, and we’ve only just got to useful enough to start really being useful for daily workflows.

Sam is more about fundraising and getting the word out there but he should keep out of product decisions. reply deepGem 2 hours agorootparentBrockman is with Sam, which makes them a formidable duo. Should they choose to, they will offer stiff competition to OpenAI but they may not even want to compete. reply kazamaloo 2 hours agorootparentFor a company to be as successful as OpenAI, two people won&#x27;t cut it.

Thats the only fireable offense that warrants this language.My bet: Sam initiated some commercial agreement (like a sale) to an entity that would have violated the “open” nature of the company. Likely he pursued a sale to Microsoft without the board knowing. reply podnami 11 hours agoparentDoesn’t make any sense. He is ideologically driven - why would he risk a once in a lifetime opportunity for a mere sale?Desperate times calls for desperate measures.

Many of us who are following the \"AI story\" have seen his recent communication &#x2F; \"testimony\"[1] with the US Congress.It was abundantly obvious how he was using weasel language like \"I&#x27;m very &#x27;nervous&#x27; and a &#x27;little bit scared&#x27; about what we&#x27;ve created [at OpenAI]\" and other such BS.

I don&#x27;t see this expressed enough.A true idealist would be committed to working on open models. Anyone who thinks Sam was in it for the good of humanity is falling for the same \"I&#x27;m-rich-but-I-care\" schtick pulled off by Elon, SBF, and others. reply theptip 8 hours agorootparentI understand why your ideals are compatible with open source models, but I think you’re mistaken here.There is a perfectly sound idealistic argument for not publishing weights, and indeed most in the x-risk community take this position.The basic idea is that AI is the opposite of software; if you publish a model with scary capabilities you can’t undo that action. Whereas with FOSS software, more eyes mean more bugs found and then everyone upgrades to a more secure version.If OpenAI publishes GPT-5 weights, and later it turns out that a certain prompt structure unlocks capability gains to mis-aligned AGI, you can’t put that genie back in the bottle.And indeed if you listen to Sam talk (eg on Lex’s podcast) this is the reasoning he uses.Sure, plenty of reasons this could be a smokescreen, but wanted to push back on the idea that the position itself is somehow not compatible with idealism. reply kdmccormick 8 hours agorootparentI appreciate your take. I didn&#x27;t know that was his stated reasoning, so that&#x27;s good to know.I&#x27;m not fully convinced, though...> if you publish a model with scary capabilities you can’t undo that action.This is true of conventional software, too! I can picture a politician or businessman from the 80s insisting that operating systems, compilers, and drivers should remain closed source because, in the wrong hands, they could be used to wreak havoc on national security. And they would be right about the second half of that! It&#x27;s just that security-by-obscurity is never a solution. The bad guys will always get their hands on the tools, so the best thing to do is to give the tools to everyone and trust that there are more good guys than bad guys.Now, I know AGI is different than convnetional software (I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s the \"opposite\", though). I accept that giving everyone access to weights may be worse than keeping them closed until they are well-aligned (whenever that is). But that would go against every instinct I have, so I&#x27;m inclined to believe that open is better :)All that said, I think I would have less of an issue if it didn&#x27;t seem like they were commandeering the term \"open\" from the volunteers and idealists in the FOSS world who popularized it. If a company called, idk, VirtuousAI wanted to keep their weights secret, OK. But OpenAI? Come on. reply theptip 6 hours agorootparentThe analogy would be publishing designs for nuclear weapons, or a bioweapon; hard-to-obtain capabilities that are effectively impossible for adversaries to obtain are treated very differently than vulns that a motivated teenager can find. To be clear we are talking about (hypothetical) civilization-ending risks, which I don’t think software has ever credibly risked.I take a less cynical view on the name; they were committed to open source in the beginning, and did open up their models IIUC. Then they realized the above, and changed path. At the same time, realizing they needed huge GPU clusters, and being purely non-profit would not enable that. Again I see why it rubs folks the wrong way, more so on this point. reply kimixa 4 hours agorootparentAnother analogy would be cryptographic software - it was classed as a munition and people said similar things about the danger of it getting out to \"The Bad Guys\" reply oooyay 3 hours agorootparentYou used past tense, but that is the present. Embargoes from various countries include cryptographic capabilities, including open source ones, for this reason. It&#x27;s not unfounded, but a world without personal cryptography is not sustainable as technology advances. People before computers were used to some level of anonymity and confidentiality that you cannot get in the modern world without cryptography. reply theptip 4 hours agorootparentprevAgain, my reference class is “things that could end civilization”, which I hope we can all agree was not the claim about crypto.But yes, if you just consider the mundane benefits and harms of AI, it looks a lot like crypto; it both benefits our economy and can be weaponized, including by our adversaries. reply sudosysgen 3 hours agorootparentWell, just like nuclear weapons, eventually the cat is out of the bag, and you can&#x27;t really stop people from making them anymore. Except that, obviously, it&#x27;s much easier to train an LLM than to enrich uranium. It&#x27;s not a secret you can keep for long - after all it only took, what, 3 years for the Soviets to catch up to fission weapons, and then only 8 months to catch up to fusion weapons (arguably beating the US to the bunch of the first weaponizable fusion design)Anyway, the point is, obfuscation doesn&#x27;t work to keep scary technology away. reply kimixa 33 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure the cat was ever in the bag for LLMs. Every big player has their own flavor now, and it seems the reason why I don&#x27;t have one myself is an issue of finances rather than secret knowledge. OpenAI&#x27;s possible advantages seem to be more about scale and optimization rather than doing anything really different.And I&#x27;m not sure this allegedly-bagged cat has claws either - the current crop of LLMs are still clearly in a different category to \"intelligence\". It&#x27;s pretty easy to see their limitations, and behave more like the fancy text predictors they are rather than something that can truly extrapolate, which is required for even the start of some AI sci-fi movie plot. Maybe continued development and research along that path will lead to more capabilities, but we&#x27;re certainly not there yet, and I&#x27;d suspect not particularly close.Maybe they actually have some super secret internal stuff that fixes those flaws, and are working on making sure it&#x27;s safe before releasing it. And maybe I have a dragon in my garage.I generally feel hyperbolic language about such things to be damaging, as it makes it so easy to roll your eyes about something that&#x27;s clearly false, and that can get inertia to when things develop to where things may actually need to be considered. LLMs are clearly not currently an \"existential threat\", and the biggest advantage to keeping it closed appears to be financial benefits in a competitive market. So it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, but don&#x27;t you understand I&#x27;m protecting you from this evil fire breathing dragon for your own good!It smells of some fantasy gnostic tech wizard, where only those who are smart enough to figure out the spell themselves are truly smart enough to know how to use it responsibly. And who doesn&#x27;t want to think of themselves as smart? But that doesn&#x27;t seem to match similar things in the real world - like the Manhattan project - many of the people developing it were rather gung-ho with proposals for various uses, and even if some publicly said it was possibly a mistake post-fact, they still did it. Meaning their \"smarts\" on how to use it came too late.And as you pointed out, nuclear weapon control by limiting information has already failed. If north Korea can develop them, one of the least connected nations in the world, surely anyone with the required resources can. The only limit today seems the cost to nations, and how relatively obvious the large infrastructure around it seems to be, allowing international pressure before things get into to the \"stockpiling usable weapons\" stage. replyekianjo 4 hours agorootparentprev> if you publish a model with scary capabilities you can’t undo that actionBut then its fine to sell the weights to Microsoft? Thats some twisted logic here. reply JohnFen 6 hours agorootparentprevI think the point is that they shouldn&#x27;t be using the word \"Open\" in their name.

He could have some kind of more opaque arrangement that gives him a material stake in the financial success of OpenAI, and downplayed it or didn&#x27;t disclose it to the board.Who knows, though -- I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find out more in the next few weeks, but it&#x27;s fun to guess. reply chubot 10 hours agorootparentYeah that&#x27;s my guess too. The claim that he doesn&#x27;t hold equity always struck me as suspect. It&#x27;s a little like SBF driving around in the Toyota Corolla while buying tens of millions of dollars of real estate for himself and his family.It&#x27;s better to claim your stake in a forthright way, than to have some kind of lucrative side deal, off the books.For a non-profit, there was too much secrecy about the company structure (the shift to being closed rather than Open), the source of training data, and the financial arrangements with Microsoft. And a few years ago a whole bunch of employees left to start a different company&#x2F;non-profit, etc.It feels like a ton of stuff was simmering below the surface.(I should add that I have no idea why someone who was wealthy before OpenAI would want to do such a thing, but it&#x27;s the only reason I can imagine for this abrupt firing. There are staggering amounts of money at play, so there&#x27;s room for portions of it to be un-noticed.) reply thedailymail 8 hours agorootparentIn recent profile, it was stated that he jokes in private about becoming the first trillionaire, which doesnt seem to reconcile with the public persona he sought to craft.

If Jobs actually had NO equity like Altman claims, then that wouldn&#x27;t be the case! Which is why it&#x27;s important for everyone to be clear about their stake.It&#x27;s definitely possible for CEOs to steal from employees. There are actually corporate raiders, and Jobs wasn&#x27;t one of them.(Of course he&#x27;s no saint, and did a bunch of other sketchy things, like collusion to hold down employee salaries, and financial fraud:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;how-jobs-dodged-the-stock-optio...The SEC&#x27;s complaint focuses on the backdating of two large option grants, one of 4.8 million shares for Apple&#x27;s executive team and the other of 7.5 million shares for Steve Jobs.)I have no idea what happened in Altman&#x27;s case. Now I think there may not be any smoking gun, but just an accumulation of all these \"curious\" and opaque decisions and outcomes. Basically a continuation of all the stuff that led a whole bunch of people to leave a few years ago. reply MrVandemar 8 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s definitely possible for CEOs to steal from employees..I&#x27;m pretty sure that CEO salaries across the board means that CEO&#x27;s are definitely — in their own way — \"stealing\" from the employees. Certainly one of those groups is over-compensated, and the other, in general, is not. reply chubot 4 hours agorootparentWhat I meant is that there are corporate raids of declining&#x2F;old companies like Sears and K-Mart. Nobody wants to run these companies on their way down, so opportunistic people come along, promise the board the world, cause a lot of chaos, find loopholes to enrich themselves -- then leave the company in a worse state than when they joined.Apple was a declining company when Jobs came back the second time. He also managed to get the ENTIRE board fired, IIRC. He created a new board of his own choosing.So in theory he could have raided the company for its assets, but that&#x27;s obviously not what happened.By taking $1 salary, he&#x27;s saying that he intends to build the company&#x27;s public value in the long term, not just take its remaining cash in the short term. That&#x27;s not what happens at many declining companies. The new leaders don&#x27;t always intend to turn the company around.So in those cases I&#x27;d say the CEO is stealing from shareholders, and employees are often shareholders.On the other hand, I don&#x27;t really understand Altman&#x27;s compensation. I&#x27;m not sure I would WANT to work under a CEO that has literally ZERO stake in the company. There has to be more to the story. reply coredog64 5 hours agorootparentprevCEOs are typically paid in equity.

They found a reason to fire him that not necessarily reflects why they are firing him. He and Ilya no longer saw eye to eye and it reached its fever pitch with gpt 4 turbo.Ultimately, it’s been surmised that Sutskever had all the leverage because of his technical ability. Sam being the consummate businessperson, they probably got in some final disagreement and Sutskever reached his tipping point and decided to use said leverage.I’ve been in tech too long and have seen this play out.

None of this adds up. The only thing that makes any sense, given OpenAI has any sense and self interest at all, is that the reason they let Altman go may have even been bigger than even what they were saying, and that there was some lack of candor in his communications with the board. Otherwise, you don&#x27;t make an announcement like that 30 minutes before markets close on a Friday. reply YetAnotherNick 2 hours agorootparentprevEven if their case is 100% solid, they wouldn&#x27;t have said it publically.

A board doesn&#x27;t do that unless they absolutely have to.Think back in history. For example, consider the absolutely massive issues at Uber that had to go public before the board did anything. There is no way this is over some disagreement, there has to be serious financial, ethical or social wrongdoing for the board to rush job it and put a company worth tens of billions of dollars at risk. reply tsimionescu 3 hours agorootparentPer other profiles of OpenAI, this is an organization of true believers in the benefits and dangers of AGI.

In this case, I imagine the board members have much broader and longer-term perspectives and considerations factoring into their decision making than the significant, significant majority of other companies&#x2F;boards. Generalizing doesn’t seem particularly helpful. reply foobiekr 3 hours agorootparentGeneralizing is how we reason, and having been on boards and worked with them closely, I can straight up tell you that&#x27;s not how it works.In general, everyone is professional unless there&#x27;s something really bad. This was quite unprofessionally handled, and so we draw the obvious conclusion. reply pfannkuchen 4 hours agoparentprevOr there was a disagreement about whether the dishonesty was over the line? Dishonesty happens all the time and people have different perspectives on what constitutes being dishonest and on whether a specific action was dishonest or not. The existence of a disagreement does not mean that it has nothing to do with dishonesty. reply lenerdenator 8 hours agoparentprevI think that if there were a lack of truth to him being less-than-candid with the board, they would have left that part out. You don’t basically say that an employee (particularly a c-suiter with lots of money for lawyers) lied unless you think that you could reasonably defend that statement in court. Otherwise, it’s defamation. reply johnwheeler 8 hours agorootparentI’m not saying there is lack of truth. I’m saying that’s not the real reason. It could be there’s a scandal to be found, but my guess is the hostility from OpenAI is just preemptive.There’s really no nice way to tell someone to fuck off from the biggest thing. Ever. reply lenerdenator 8 hours agorootparentI mean I&#x27;m not a lawyer (of the big city or simple country varieties, or any other variety) but if you talk to most HR people they&#x27;ll tell you that if they ever get a phone call from a prospective employer to confirm details about someone having worked there previously, the three things they&#x27;ll typically say are:1) a confirmation of the dates of employment2) a confirmation of the role&#x2F;title during employment3) whether or not they would rehire that person... and that&#x27;s it. The last one is a legally-sound way of saying that their time at the company left something to be desired, up to and including the point of them being terminated. It doesn&#x27;t give them exposure under defamation because it&#x27;s completely true, as the company is fully in-charge of that decision and can thus set the reality surrounding it.That&#x27;s for a regular employee who is having their information confirmed by some hiring manager in a phone or email conversation. This is a press release for a company connected to several very high-profile corporations in a very well-connected business community. Arguably it&#x27;s the biggest tech exec news of the year. If there&#x27;s ulterior or additional motive as you suggest, there&#x27;s a possibility Sam goes and hires the biggest son-of-a-bitch attorney in California to convince a jury that the ulterior or additional motive was _the only_ motive, and that calling Sam a liar in a press release was defamation. As a result, OpenAI&#x2F;the foundation, would probably be paying him _at least_ several million dollars (probably a lot more) for making him hard to hire on at other companies.Either he simply lied to the board and that&#x27;s it, or OpenAI&#x27;s counsel didn&#x27;t do their job and put their foot down over the language used in the press release. reply wavemode 7 hours agorootparentSomeone at OpenAI hates the man&#x27;s guts. It&#x27;s that simple.Even with very public cases of company leaders who did horrible things (much worse than lying), the companies that fired them said nothing officially. The person just \"resigned\". There&#x27;s just no reason open up even the faintest possibility of an expensive lawsuit, even if they believe they can win.So yeah, someone definitely told the lawyers to go fuck themselves when they decided to go with this inflammatory language. reply adastra22 3 hours agorootparent> So yeah, someone definitely told the lawyers to go fuck themselves when they decided to go with this inflammatory language.You&#x27;re assuming they even consulted the lawyers... reply lenerdenator 7 hours agorootparentprevWell, for their sake, I hope they either issue a retraction soon, have good lawyers and documentation of their decision, or Sam turns out to be a forgiving person.I wouldn&#x27;t put money on the last one, though. reply staticman2 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can&#x27;t say a person resigned if they refused to resign, correct? If the person says they refuse to resign you have to fire them. So that&#x27;s one scenario where they would have to say they fired him.You also wouldn&#x27;t try to avoid a lawsuit if you believed (hypothetically) it was impossible to avoid a lawsuit. reply rootusrootus 7 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t know that this is always the case. For example, when BK was forced to resign from Intel, the board&#x27;s announcement was quite specific on why. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprevThere is no legal justification for ever saying those dates, much less their department and role. I have never heard of any HR department saying anything of the sort, even if this is an oft-quoted meme of HR. I suspect you have actually never worked in HR to provide such statements, you are merely speculating. reply anigbrowl 8 hours agorootparentprevJohn, I don&#x27;t think you understand how corporate law departments work. It&#x27;s not like a romantic or friend breakup where someone says a mean remark about the other to underline that it&#x27;s over; there&#x27;s a big legal risk to the corporate entity from carelessly damaging someone&#x27;s reputation like that, so it&#x27;s smarter to just keep the personality&#x2F;vision disagreements private and limit public statements to platitudes. reply johnwheeler 8 hours agorootparentPlease don’t patronize me.

If someone doesn’t want me to do that, I’d expect them to introduce themselves as “Mr. so-and-so”, instead. reply TeMPOraL 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not the first name alone, it&#x27;s also the sentence structure. \"Hey John, did you hear about...\" sounds perfectly normal even when talking on-line to strangers. \"John, you misunderstand...\" is appropriate if you&#x27;re their parent or spouse or otherwise in some kind of close relationship. reply jrockway 2 hours agorootparentYou have explained this much more concisely than me. reply jrockway 2 hours agorootparentprevIn person, sure, that&#x27;s totally normal. It&#x27;s unusual on a forum for a few reasons:1) The comments are meant to be read by all, not just the author. If you want to email the author directly and start the message with a greeting containing their name (\"hi jrockway!\"), or even just their name, that&#x27;s pretty normal.2) You don&#x27;t actually know the person&#x27;s first name. In this case, it&#x27;s pretty obvious, since the user in question goes by what looks like . But who knows if that&#x27;s actually their name. Plenty of people name their accounts after fictional people. It would be weird to everyone if your HN comment to darthvader was \"Darth, I don&#x27;t think you understand how corporate law departments work.\" Darth is not reading the comment. (OK, actually I would find that hilarious to read.)3) Starting a sentence with someone&#x27;s name and a long pause (which the written comma heavily implies) sounds like a parent scolding a child. You rarely see this form outside of a lecture, and the original comment in question is a lecture. You add the person&#x27;s name to the beginning of the comment to be extra patronizing. I know that&#x27;s what was going on and the person who was being replied to knows that&#x27;s what was going on. The person who used that language denies that they were trying to be patronizing, but frankly, I don&#x27;t believe it. Maybe they didn&#x27;t mean to consciously do it, but they typed the extra word at the beginning of the sentence for some reason. What was that reason? If to soften the lecture, why not soften it even more by simply not clicking reply? It just doesn&#x27;t add up.4) It&#x27;s Simply Not Done. Open any random HN discussion, and 99.99% of the time, nobody is starting replies with someone&#x27;s name and a comma. It&#x27;s not just HN; the same convention applies on Reddit. When you use style that deviates from the norm, you&#x27;re sending a message, and it&#x27;s going to have a jarring effect on the reader. Doubly jarring if you&#x27;re the person they&#x27;re naming.TL;DR: Don&#x27;t start your replies with the name of the person you&#x27;re replying to. If you&#x27;re talking with someone in person, sure, throw their name in there. That&#x27;s totally normal. In writing? Less normal. reply EFreethought 4 hours agorootparentprevIt happened to me recently on a list where I post under my real name, and yes, it&#x27;s irritating, especially if it is someone you never met, and they are disagreeing with you. reply jholman 3 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not the \"online\" that&#x27;s the issue exactly, I think Jerrrry didn&#x27;t describe it exactly right, but it&#x27;s still correct. I, too, personally, thought it was very clear that the \"John, \" was ... I dunno if it was patronizing or what, but marginally impolite or condescending or patronizing or something. Unless, unbeknownst to us, anigbrowl and johnwheeler are old personal associates (probably offline), in which case it would mean \"remember that I know you\", and the implication of that would depend on the history in the relationship.I recognize that the above para sort of sounds like I think I have some authority to mediate between them, which is not true and not what I think. I&#x27;m just replying to this side conversation about how to be polite in public, just giving my take.The broad pattern here is that there are norms around how and when you use someone&#x27;s name when addressing them, and when you deviate from those norms, it signals that something is weird, and then the reader has to guess what is the second most likely meaning of the rest of the sentence, because the weird name use means that the most likely meaning is not appropriate. reply oooyay 2 hours agorootparentprevNo. Look at examples where people hurl veiled threats at dang.

I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s going to be a very, very big number.Unless OpenAI can prove in a court of law that what they said was true, they&#x27;re on the hook for that amount in compensation, perhaps plus punitive damages and legal costs. reply svnt 6 hours agorootparentprevNone of these people seem to be typical corporate board members, except maybe Altman. reply johnwheeler 7 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;karaswisher&#x2F;status&#x2F;1725702501435941294 reply cowl 8 hours agoparentprevDoesn&#x27;t justify the hostile language and the urgent last minute timing.

That leads me to believe that yes, this was something big and worthy enough of being announced with that timing, and that it was probably not a mistake. reply vikramkr 2 hours agorootparentThey also said Greg was going to stay at the company and then he immediately quit.

They call it: The shit hitting the fan. reply nostrademons 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this is more abrupt and more direct than any CEO firing I&#x27;ve ever seen. For comparison, when Travis Kalanick was ousted from Uber in 2017, he \"resigned\" and then was able to stay on the board until 2019. When Equifax had their data breach, it took 4 days for the CEO to resign and then the board retroactively changed it to \"fired for cause\". With the Volkswagon emissions scandal, it took 20 days for the CEO to resign (again, not fired) despite the threat of criminal proceedings.You don&#x27;t fire your CEO and call him a liar if you have any choice about it. That just invites a lawsuit, bad blood, and a poor reputation in the very small circles of corporate executives and board members.That makes me think that Sam did something on OpenAI&#x27;s behalf that could be construed as criminal, and the board had to fire him immediately and disavow all knowledge (\"not completely candid\") so that they don&#x27;t bear any legal liability. It also fits with the new CEO being the person previously in charge of safety, governance, ethics, etc.That Greg Brockman, Eric Schmidt, et al are defending Altman makes me think that this is in a legal grey area, something new, and it was on behalf of training better models. Something that an ends-justifies-the-means technologist could look at and think \"Of course, why aren&#x27;t we doing that?\" while a layperson would be like \"I can&#x27;t believe you did that.\" It&#x27;s probably not something mundane like copyright infringement or webscraping or even GDPR&#x2F;CalOppa violations though - those are civil penalties, and wouldn&#x27;t make the board panic as strongly as they did. reply username332211 1 hour agorootparentYou are comparing a corporate scandals, but the alternative theory in this forum seems to be a power struggle and power struggles have completely different mechanics.Think of it as the difference between a vote of no confidence and a coup.

That would be the sort of thing where if you&#x27;re in favour of building the AI faster you&#x27;re like \"Why wouldn&#x27;t we do this?\" and if you&#x27;re worried the AI may be trying to release a bioweapon to escape you&#x27;re like \"How could you even consider building to these schematics?\".I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s correct not because it sounds like a sci-fi novel, but because I think it&#x27;s unlikely that it&#x27;s even remotely plausible that a new version of their internal AI system would be good enough at this point in time to do something like that, considering all the many problems that need to be solved for Drexler to be right.I think it&#x27;s much more likely that this was an ideological disagreement about safety in general rather than a given breakthrough or technology in specific, and Ilya got the backing of US NatSec types (apparently their representative on the board sided with him) to get Sam ousted. reply Apocryphon 6 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s correct not because it sounds like a sci-fi novel, but because I think it&#x27;s unlikely that it&#x27;s even remotely plausible that a new version of their internal AI system would be good enough at this point in time to do something like thatAren&#x27;t these synonymous at this point? The conceit that you can point AGI at any arbitrary speculative sci-fi concept and it can just invent it is a sci-fi trope. reply lucubratory 5 hours agorootparentNo, not really. Calling something \"science-fiction\" at the present moment is generally an insult intended to say something along the lines of \"You&#x27;re an idiot for believing this made up children&#x27;s story could be real, it&#x27;s like believing in fairies\", which is of course a really dumb thing to say because science fiction has a very long history of predicting technological advances (the internet, tanks, video calls, not just phones but flip phones, submarines, television, the lunar landing, credit cards, aircraft, robotics, drones, tablets, bionic limbs, antidepressants) so the idea that because something is in science fiction it is therefore a stupid idea to think it is a real possibility for separate reasons is really, really dumb. It would also be dumb to think something is possible only because it exists in science fiction, like how many people think about faster than light travel, but science fiction is not why people believe AGI is possible.Basically, there&#x27;s a huge difference between \"I don&#x27;t think this is a feasible explanation for X event that just happened for specific technical reasons\" (good) and \"I don&#x27;t think this is a possible explanation of X event that just happened because it has happened in science fiction stories, so it cannot be true\" (dumb).About nanotechnology specifically, if Drexler from Drexler-Smalley is right then an AGI would probably be able to invent it by definition. If Drexler is right that means it&#x27;s in principle possible and just a matter of engineering, and an AGI (or a narrow superhuman AI at this task) by definition can do that engineering, with enough time and copies of itself. reply Apocryphon 4 hours agorootparentHow would a superhuman intelligence invent a new non-hypothetical actually-working device without actually conducting physical experiments, building prototypes, and so on? By conducting really rigorous meta-analysis of existing research papers? Every single example you listed involved work IRL.> with enough time and copies of itself.Alright, but that’s not what you the previous post was hypothesizing，which is that OpenAI was possibly able to do that without physical experimentation. reply lucubratory 3 hours agorootparentYes, the sort of challenges you&#x27;re talking about are pretty much exactly why I don&#x27;t consider it feasible that OpenAI has an internal system that is at that level yet. I would consider it to be at the reasonable limits of possibility that they could have an AI that could give a very convincing, detailed, & feasible \"grant proposal\" style plan for answering those questions, which wouldn&#x27;t qualify for OPs comment.With a more advanced AI system, one that could build better physics simulation environments, write software that&#x27;s near maximally efficient, design better atomic modelling and tools than currently exist, and put all of that into thinking through a plan to achieve the technology (effectively experimenting inside its own head), I could maybe see it being possible for it to make it without needing the physical lab work. That level of cognitive achievement is what I think is infeasible that OpenAI could possibly have internally right now, for several reasons. Mainly that it&#x27;s extremely far ahead of everything else to the point that I think they&#x27;d need recursive self-improvement to have gotten there, and I know for a fact there are many people at OpenAI who would rebel before letting a recursively self-improving AI get to that point. And two, if they lucked into something that capable accidentally by some freak accident, they wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep it quiet for a few days, let alone a few weeks.Basically, I don&#x27;t think \"a single technological advancement that product wants to implement and safety thinks is insane\" is a good candidate for what caused the split, because there aren&#x27;t that many such single technological advancements I can think of and all of them would require greater intelligence than I think is possible for OpenAI to have in an AI right now, even in their highest quality internal prototype. replyVirusNewbie 3 hours agorootparentprevpromising not to train on microsoft&#x27;s customer data, and then training on MSFT customer data. reply watwut 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah, but Uber is completely different organization.

A quorum of the board met, probably without the chairman, and voted the CEO of the company and the chairman of the board out. The chairman also happens to have a job as the President of the company. The President role reports to the CEO, not the board. Typically, a BOD would not fire a President, the CEO would. The board&#x27;s statement said the President would continue reporting to the CEO (now a different person) - clarifying that the dismissal as board chairman was separate from his role as a company employee.Based on the careful wording of the board&#x27;s statement as well as Greg&#x27;s tweet, I suspect he wasn&#x27;t present at the vote nor would he be eligible to vote regarding his own position as chairman.

They don&#x27;t advance that knowledge, they just regurgitate it, remix it, and expose patterns. We train them. They are very convincing, and show that the Turing test may be flawed.Given that AGI means reaching \"any intellectual task that human beings can perform\", we need a system that can go beyond lexical reasoning and actually contribute (on it&#x27;s own) to advance our total knowledge. Anything less isn&#x27;t AGI.Ilya may be right that a super-scaled transformer model (with additional mechanics beyond today&#x27;s LLMs) will achieve AGI, or he may be wrong.Therefore something more than an LLM is needed to reach AGI, what that is, we don&#x27;t yet know! reply dboreham 7 hours agorootparentPrediction: there isn&#x27;t a difference.

Disclosure: I&#x27;ve been long term skeptical about AI but that writing is up on the wall now. reply mlyle 6 hours agorootparentClearly there&#x27;s a difference, because the architectures we have don&#x27;t know how to persist information or further train.Without persistence outside of the context window, they can&#x27;t even maintain a dynamic, stable higher level goal.Whether you can bolt something small to these architectures for persistence and do some small things and get AGI is an open question, but what we have is clearly insufficient by design.I expect it&#x27;s something in-between: our current approaches are a fertile ground for improving towards AGI, but it&#x27;s also not a trivial further step to get there. reply visarga 1 hour agorootparentBut context windows got to 100K now, RAG systems are everywhere, and we can cheaply fine-tune LoRAs for a price similar with inferencing, maybe 3x more expensive per token. A memory hierarchy made of LoRA -> Context -> RAG could be \"all you need\".My beef with RAG is that it doesn&#x27;t match on information that is not explicit in the text, so \"the fourth word of this phrase\" won&#x27;t embed like the word \"of\", or \"Bruce Willis&#x27; mother&#x27;s first name\" won&#x27;t match with \"Marlene\". To fix this issue we need to draw chain-of-thought inferences from the chunks we index in the RAG system.So my conclusion is that maybe we got the model all right but the data is too messy, we need to improve the data by studying it with the model prior to indexing. That would also fix the memory issues.Everyone is over focusing on models to the detriment of thinking about the data. But models are just data gradients stacked up, we forget that. All the smarts the model has come from the data. We need data improvement more than model improvement.Just consider the \"Textbook quality data\" paper Phi-1.5 and Orca datasets, they show that diverse chain of thought synthetic data is 5x better than organic text. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprev> Clearly there&#x27;s a difference, because the architectures we have don&#x27;t know how to persist information or further train.

And, if you ask it to create a plan to do a thing, it can do that. So, there you have it: goal-oriented persistence outside of the context window.I don&#x27;t claim that RAG + LLM = AGI, but I do think it takes you a long way toward goal-oriented, autonomous agents with at least a degree of intelligence. reply darkerside 6 hours agorootparentprev> Without persistence outside of the context window, they can&#x27;t even maintain a dynamic, stable higher level goal.I mean, can&#x27;t you say the same for people?

People can intelligently problem-solve without a task.And working towards long-term goals is something we actually take decades to learn. And many fail there as well.I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if, just like in our brain, we&#x27;ll start adding other modalities that improve memory, planning, etc etc. Seems that they started doing this with the vision update in GPT-4.I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if these LLMs really become the backbone of the AGI.

For the second part we need good feedback. Humans and LLMs are just as good at novel ideation, but humans have the advantage on feedback. We have a body, access to the real world, access to other humans and plenty of tools.This is not something an android robot couldn&#x27;t eventually have, and on top of that AIs got the advantage of learning from massive data. They surpass humans when they can leverage it - see AlphaFold, for example. mlyle 4 hours agorootparentprevReal-time fine tuning would be one approach that probably helps with some things (improving performance at a task based on feedback) but is probably not well suited for others (remembering analogous situations, setting goals; it&#x27;s not really clear how one fine-tunes a context window into persistence in an LLM). There&#x27;s also the concern that right now we seem to need many, many more examples in training data than humans get for the machine to get passably good at similar tasks.I would also say that I believe that long-term goal oriented behavior isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s well represented in the training data. We have stories about it, sometimes, but there&#x27;s a need to map self-state to these stories to learn anything about what we should do next from them.I feel like LLMs are much smarter than we are in thinking \"per symbol\", but we have facilities for iteration and metacognition and saving state that let us have an advantage.

But while the car is convenient, these short trips add up in terms of emissions, pollution and petrol cost. Close to half (44%) of all Australian commuter trips are by car – and under 10km. Of Perth’s 4.2 million daily car trips, 2.8 are for distances of less than 2km. This is common in wealthier countries. In the United States, a staggering 60% of all car trips cover less than 10km. So what’s the best solution? You might think switching to an electric vehicle is the natural step. In fact, for short trips, an electric bike or moped might be better for you – and for the planet. That’s because these forms of transport – collectively known as electric micromobility – are cheaper to buy and run. But it’s more than that – they are actually displacing four times as much demand for oil as all the world’s electric cars at present, due to their staggering uptake in China and other nations where mopeds are a common form of transport. Electric mopeds have surged in popularity – especially in China. Shutterstock How can that be? On the world’s roads last year, there were over 20 million electric vehicles and 1.3 million commercial EVs such as buses, delivery vans and trucks. But these numbers of four or more wheel vehicles are wholly eclipsed by two- and three-wheelers. There were over 280 million electric mopeds, scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers on the road last year. Their sheer popularity is already cutting demand for oil by a million barrels of oil a day – about 1% of the world’s total oil demand, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. What about electric vehicles, you ask? After all, EVs have been heralded as a silver bullet for car emissions and air pollution in cities, as their tailpipe emissions are zero. If charged with renewable power, they get even greener. But to see them as an inarguable good is an error. They are cleaner cars, but they are still cars, taking up space on the roads and requiring a lot of electricity to power them. Their batteries make them heavier than a traditional car, and draw heavily on the extraction of rare earth elements. While EVs are overall much greener than internal combustion engine cars, battery manufacture can undermine some of the gains. On the plus side, petrol cars cost about A$0.14 per kilometre in fuel, or about $1,820 in fuel annually for the average car doing 12,000km. Maintenance averages at $910 a year, bringing the total to $2,730 for a petrol car. By contrast, charging an EV would cost around $480 for that distance. Maintenance of $240 takes annual running costs to $720. So EVs are much cheaper to run. But they are expensive to buy. Read more: Five years on, Brisbane's e-scooters and e-bikes are winning over tourists and residents as they open up the city What advantages do electric mopeds and bikes have? The electric transport revolution is a great chance to rethink how we move through our cities – and whether we even need a car at all. Cars, after all, often have only one occupant. You’re expending a lot of energy to transport yourself. By contrast, electric mopeds and bikes use a lot less energy to transport one or two people. They’re also a lot cheaper to buy and run than electric cars. If you commute on an e-bike 20km a day, five days a week, your charging cost would be about $20 – annually. In Australia, electric bikes are very rapidly going from a hobbyist pursuit to a serious mode of urban transport. Over 100,000 e-bikes were sold here last year. Of course, you’re unlikely to use electric mopeds or bikes to drive from Sydney to Melbourne. Their real value is in short-hop trips – the school run, the milk and bread run or even the commute – where they take roughly the same time or shorter than a car. E-bikes and electric mopeds are cutting oil demand more than electric vehicles. Shutterstock Smaller electric options like scooters and skateboards also offer a way to overcome the last kilometre problem which plagues public transport systems. This, in short, is the inconvenient distance between your home and the station or bus stop. Being able to cover this distance fast can be a game-changer for public transport. If taken up, electric micromobility can cut urban emissions. A study of e-scooter riders in the United Kingdom found these trips produced up to 45% less carbon dioxide than alternatives. US researchers estimate that if e-bike trips expanded to 11% of all vehicle trips, transport emissions would fall by about 7%. As petrol prices increase and battery prices fall, the cheaper running costs of electric vehicles and even cheaper running costs of electric mopeds, bikes and scooters will keep eating away at the demand for oil. Global oil demand is now projected to peak in 2028 at 105.7 million barrels per day – and then begin to fall, according to the International Energy Agency. Electric vehicles will play a role in cutting oil demand. But it may well be that electric micromobility cuts demand faster, given how fast these cheaper, more plentiful options are being taken up. What does this mean for me? If you’re looking to go electric, it’s worth taking a close look at your transport needs. If you live in an outer suburb or regional towns, you may find the longer range and larger capacity of an electric car is better suited. But for many people, it’s likely you’ll have a range of options. You might have one electric vehicle for longer trips, or group trips, as well as an e-bike for the school run or groceries.

We cannot reproduce the rates of rich world car ownership in the developing world without mass catastrophe (raw materials&#x2F;labor needed for construction and maintenance, raw materials&#x2F;labor&#x2F;space needed for roads and parking lots, literal tons of waste--batteries, tires, steel, plastic, foam--, energy needed--most cars are driven by a single driver, pollution generated by all of this--e.g. mining byproducts and tire burn off).To be completely explicit:- If we&#x27;re serious about meeting the 2030 \"halve our emissions\" and 2050 \"zero our emissions\" goals, EVs will not get there. Banning gas&#x2F;diesel cars gets there. The only way that&#x27;s even remotely possible is to heavily subsidize EVs (probably honestly just providing free swaps) and start making it way way more easier to get by w&#x2F;o a car.- The only problem that self-driving cars will ever solve is where to put VC money in a zero interest rate world. We&#x27;ve had freight trains and mass transit for centuries.I get that whole economies are built around producing&#x2F;maintaining cars and related infra, but it was wildly disastrous. We&#x27;re well into sunk cost fallacy territory here, like, on a species level. reply willio58 17 hours agoparentFully agreed. And while everything you said is super important and true, one piece that really makes me pumped about this movement to ditch cars is more around quality of life.If you have to get in a car and drive to a parking lot somewhere to get groceries, commute to work, go out with friends, get healthcare, etc. You will obviously live a less healthy life both physically but also mentally because of it. Walking is exercise, it&#x27;s something we were all evolved to do and it keeps us healthy physically and mentally. It also encourages community when everyone isn&#x27;t surrounded by a metal and plastic multi-ton machine. I recently moved to a walkable part of my city and it&#x27;s actually amazing how much it&#x27;s benefited my life. I say hi to neighbors and people who walk routes like I do, I get fresh air since not every street is filled to the brim with cars, but honestly one of the best effects is silence. Cars our LOUD. Even electric cars unfortunately, it really has little to do with the sound of the engine at speeds like 30mph, it&#x27;s more about wind and tire noise. Meanwhile, people walking, biking, or on scooters are silent and it&#x27;s brought me a lot of peace. reply uneekname 16 hours agorootparentI totally agree about the noise and health benefits, but to me it&#x27;s more a matter of respect and safety. In the U.S., we see too many pedestrians die each year. Our roads are built for cars only, with everything else as an afterthought. When I cross the street, drivers act like it&#x27;s my responsibility to stay out of their way.If some people need to use cars for mobility or business reasons, that is fine with me. But they need to have the utmost respect for me as a pedestrian&#x2F;bicyclist. And the way to accomplish that is to make streets that force cars to slow down and watch out. If we make our cities safe for walking and biking, more people will do so! reply willio58 16 hours agorootparent> If some people need to use cars for mobility or business reasons, that is fine with me.Definitely. For stuff like that, emergency services, delivery, trash collection, etc. larger vehicles on streets are totally fine and I think most would agree.I don&#x27;t even necessarily think we should ban all cars, but we should definitely stop incentivizing them by heavily subsidizing car infrastructure with city budgets funded by taxpayers. I think if we stop the incentives that were heavily lobbied for by car companies we&#x27;ll find the _true_ most efficient ways to build cities which will most likely be heavily geared toward walkability and bike-ability, public transport, etc. reply mdgrech23 15 hours agorootparentworth visiting an old city like Rome. I was shocked by how walkable it was. It was maybe the second night we were there, we causally strolled around after dinner and just happenstance managed to walk by all the major attractions. That&#x27;s no mistake but honestly when you experience it&#x27;s so magical. To create a tech analogy I remember the days before Google when search when would have 20 buttons and could take regex and what not. Most people had no idea how to use it and even pros questioned if they were correctly searching so to speak than Google came along and just gave us a box. All that complexity hidden away from us. That was kind of how I felt about Rome. Just wander, you&#x27;ll get to where you want to go. reply vel0city 13 hours agorootparent> I was shocked by how walkable it was.I don&#x27;t see why it would be shocking. It was a city for nearly 3,000 years before cars arrived. reply jackson1442 10 hours agorootparentPeople who grew up in a typical post-ww2 american suburb may not have ever stayed somewhere that doesn&#x27;t depend entirely on cars to get around outside of manufactured spaces like theme parks. reply hunter-gatherer 4 hours agorootparentThe American suburbian hellscape is real.

I&#x27;m open to suggestions though. reply MrFantastic 9 hours agorootparentprevMost pre-industrial cities were limited by how far you could walk in 30 minutes to the center of town where the markets and government would be.Most people walked everywhere, especially in a city.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2019-08-29&#x2F;the-commu... reply stefs 13 hours agorootparentprevi&#x27;ve never been in rome but i visited trieste - a very walkable city - a few weeks ago and i was shocked how cars were clogging up everything there. not necessarily cars driving, but parked cars. maybe trieste is a bit special because big parts of it are on a steep hill so it&#x27;s not that well suited for cycling but none the less, i was very disappointed. not a pleasure with kids. i asked an italian friend about it and his answer was: \"welcome to italy\".so, walkable - yes, maybe. but cities that get rid of cars are still on a completely different level when it comes to quality. reply jonasdegendt 12 hours agorootparentI’ve been to a good amount of Italian cities and would agree it’s the same mess of cars all over the place, like anywhere else. I also went to Rome for the first time half a year ago and it wasn’t the mess of cars and Vespas I imagined it was going to be, so hey, perhaps Rome is the anomaly. reply galangalalgol 15 hours agorootparentprevOn another HN thread it was discussed that because road wear and tire wear and hence micro plastics, scale to the fourth with vehicle weight, a few large delivery vehicles are far worse than many lighter ones. It is better for us all to use the lightest vehicle we can to go get groceries and take our garbage to the recycling facility (or landfill) than to have trahs trucks, delivery trucks, or busses move us about. Trains or other steel wheeled things are the best. reply teemur 13 hours agorootparent> road wear and tire wear and hence micro plastics, scale to the fourth with vehicle weight,(Emphasis mine) Do you have a source for this? I do not see how this specific claim could be true, and I am not sure how exactly that needs to be modified to make it true.I mean, if you take a vehicle that weights one ton and double the number of wheels, that specific claim says that the road&#x2F;tire wear would not change, as the vehicle weight stays the same. Further, doubling the wheels can&#x27;t easily be distinguished from splitting the load to two vehicles with half the weight, which should reduce wear & tear of each vehicle to one sixteenth, totaling to one eighth. So there is kind of a contradiction.And as a sanity check, a passenger car weights ~10^3 kg. A large truck weights ~10^4. So a truck would wear the road something like as much as 10 000 passenger cars. That&#x27;s a bit hard to believe.So the actual law might be something like tear & wear scales to the fourth of the weight on a single wheel. But even that leaves something to hope, as I think you need to assume similar wheels. So maybe the actual law has something to do with pressure on the road? reply galangalalgol 12 hours agorootparentThe original fourth power law relates to axle loads, which as you point out is not the same as what I said. So we should get rivian to add a lot more wheels on those amazon trucks. But even if they put as many on as they could fit, the capacity and load is so much higher than what each person getting a delivery would use, you are still in the hole vs a normal ev not to mention a trike just big enough to pop over to the warehouse at the train station to pick up your packages.Edit: forgot to paste link https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fourth_power_law reply bobthepanda 15 hours agorootparentprevAt the same time larger vehicles generally have a better engine size to capacity ratio, so if you don’t want to pillage the earth for raw earths, lithium, cobalt etc. then large vehicles are still good. reply MrFantastic 9 hours agorootparentprevThose Amazon delivery trucks are pretty light weight.It&#x27;s not like they are hauling sand, the boxes are mostly empty. reply hnlmorg 14 hours agorootparentprevA lot of that can be solved by law too. I know a lot of Americans would see this as an infringement of their freedoms but it’s quite common in other countries to place the order of responsibility to the most vulnerable to least vulnerable. What I mean by this is that cyclists need to give way to pedestrians, and cars need to give way to cyclists and pedestrians. I’ve never quite understood the logic behind jaywalking laws because it penalises the vulnerable rather than places greater responsibility on those who are least vulnerable. reply andrepd 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s useless to build a straight road, 4 wide lanes, then stick a sign on the side going \"pls no speederino\". The roads and the streets themselves need to be designed so that they do not allow unsafe use. Meaning any road&#x2F;street shared by pedestrians needs to have narrow lanes, few lanes, sidewalks separated by e.g. a row of trees, speed bumps and raised crosswalks, bollards separating lanes, chicanes, etc. reply hnlmorg 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s already the norm in the UK. To be honest I&#x27;d forgotten many residential roads in the US were dual cartridge ways. That does make things more tricky. reply lambdasquirrel 13 hours agorootparentprevIn some Canadian cities, they build the residential streets with only one lane (there’s still traffic in two directions), and it solves both the speed problem and helps with the density problem. I hated it at first, but once I’ve parked my car (probably to take the bus, no less), I’ve thought, gee this is nice. reply kwhitefoot 12 hours agorootparentprevUS pedestrians die at a higher rate than elsewhere but not because you have a lot more vehicle miles, it&#x27;s down to the appalling quality of the roads (design construction, and maintenance), the shockingly casual attitude to drinking and driving, and the fact that so many US vehicles are pedestrian hostile.But all of those things seem to be an expression of the US majority way of thinking. That is what needs changing; if you don&#x27;t pedestrians will still be run over by drunk drivers, etc. reply mikrotikker 9 hours agorootparentprevI would personally give way to vehicles of any kind when walking, rather than expect them to give way to me. I have better visibility and awareness, I am easily manueverable and I can stop faster.I will not put my life in the hands of someone and just hope they see me in order to give way to me. I will take the initiative and be responsible for myself, not require others to be responsible for me... That is called \"being a burden\". reply dv_dt 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is such an interesting comment to me because it gets so much right on how to motivate ditching cars. If you were funding a campaign to eliminate cars to reduce carbon emissions I think you would meet with widespread resistance. If you promote an idea of a higher quality life that is possible w&#x2F;o cars and explore that - in the end I think you&#x27;d end up removing many more cars than the first approach. reply houseatrielah 16 hours agorootparentI think the root cause is further up the chain of casuality. People need cars because they live in the suburbs, they live in the suburbs because they have children, they want to raise children in more square footage than the urban housing stock offers.Notable exception being TokyoIronically, if you look NYC in the 1910s, kids used to play baseball in the street because it wasn&#x27;t yet overrun by cars, suddenly not enough space for kids, so move to the suburbs, which means more and more cars... reply aidenn0 13 hours agorootparent> I think the root cause is further up the chain of casuality.

I&#x27;m maybe a mile from a major highway that goes to the city center. It&#x27;s dead straight and major thoroughfare. If they dedicated one line to rail, none of that mixed BS, and had stops say every mile into the city my god it would be amazing. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentAre you sure it is more densely packed? Where I live the streetcar suburbs are slightly less dense than modern suburbs. In the 1950s lot sizes went up, but they have mostly come down again. (streetcar suburbs were built assuming you would get some food from your garden. 1950&#x27;s suburbs were built by&#x2F;for people who remembered the depression and wanted a large lot for a garden - or that is my theory. reply throwaheyy 14 hours agorootparentStreetcar suburbs are not 1950s suburbs, they are 1900s-1930s suburbs. 1950s suburbs are car suburbs. reply bluGill 8 hours agorootparentRight, we have all 3, and they have different forms. 1950s is the least dense. replymdgrech23 15 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re leaving how a key part, at least in America which is racism. Whites ran to the suburbs to escape particular groups and quite frankly still do albeit now it&#x27;s more in the form of urban sprawl. reply lovepronmostly 11 hours agorootparentThis is BS. People go to suburbs because they want a nice house, not because they are trying to run away from race. I grew up in a mix-race suburb. I loved my houses and my friends houses. We had great times on our cul-de-sac since it didn&#x27;t allow through traffic it was safe to play in the street. We loved our backyard pool. We loved our garage that had a radial saw and a large tool desk. We loved our large 30x20ft family room where we had large slumber parties and large family parties. It requires zero racism to want a house in the suburbs. reply Qwertious 3 hours agorootparentHistorically, suburbs absolutely were motivated by racism - it&#x27;s called \"white flight\".Today, it usually isn&#x27;t about racism, it&#x27;s mostly just continuing status-quo trends without question. But it&#x27;s important to not put the initial motivation of those trends up on a pedestal. reply jasonwatkinspdx 8 hours agorootparentprevNo need to be personally defensive. What the other comment says is entirely true. There was a mass migration, particularly during the civil rights movement. Here&#x27;s just one example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;White_flight#&#x2F;media&#x2F;File:Gary,...Plenty of other data shows the same thing. Racism is very much a part of what built suburban america in the large even if it doesn&#x27;t apply to you or your family personally. reply dv_dt 16 hours agorootparentprevSure, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s at the root either. Suburbs exist in part due to subsidy decisions on automotive infrastructure. And they&#x27;re in a stress point in the return-to-office work remote debate now, because even with subsidies on highway infrastructure the commutes to get back to city centers are a major time waste. Offsetting 2-3 hours of family life with commute time is a major quality of life negative. reply ahoy 14 hours agorootparentprev\"suburbs\" dont have to be the unwalkable disasters that we&#x27;ve made them. Brooklyn Heights was \"america&#x27;s first suburb.\" People moved there from Manhattan seeking everything you just mentioned. reply andrepd 13 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;ve got it backwards. There are suburbs because car infrastructure subsidises many of the costs of that choice. Suburbs are a postwar, post-interstate phenomenon. reply nradov 13 hours agorootparentprevPublic school quality and levels of crime (or at least perception of crime) are also huge factors driving parents of small children out of dense cities and into suburbs. Somehow most city governments have been taken over by progressive idealogues who are intent on pushing their luxury beliefs regardless of the negative impact on education or middle-class quality of life. This is how we end up with schools run for the benefit of teacher&#x27;s unions rather than students, fentanyl dealers in the neighborhood parks, homeless tents on the sidewalks, and organized shoplifting rings excused as reparations for the oppressed.If we want to give people the option of living without cars then let&#x27;s start by fixing our cities. reply anon291 15 hours agorootparentprevPeople want suburbia because crime is often lower. Why won&#x27;t we accept this reality. I don&#x27;t understand why so called progressives don&#x27;t just face this issue head on. Increasing incarceration rates makes cities safer.

Infrastructure cost is bound to be more efficient where people live in more densely populated areas. The length of pipes that a municipality needs to lay down in order to serve a single family home in the suburbs is the same as a whole 6-story building in the city (the diameters of the pipes might differ). On a per-capita basis, there&#x27;s no contest.A particular factor in the funding of suburban streets is that the initial paving is often subsidized by the federal government. Once the streets start crumbling down after ~20 years of usage, then the real cost hits.

Swapping the car out for free for an EV bike, that would be great. Subsidizing only the people who need a car, ok (ambulatory issues, etc), but we should not subsidize car ownership in general.The other part of this that I’m becoming more aware of as it’s researched more, is that the Air Quality in an area is actually more effected by dust and particulate matter from tires, brakes, and roadways than greenhouse gases (this is different from Climate impacting Greenhouse gas effects). What this means is that EV cars won’t fix the Air Quality of an area, but EV bikes definitely would.In short, I agree with your initial statement, but it’s how we get there that needs some adjustment.

This is really where the system breaks down. Poor people who may live in city centers are paying a portion of their taxes for the rich people to have nice roads paved out to their spread-out suburbs. Those who choose to live in the suburbs should pay for the increased costs of infrastructure that they require. You should pay fewer taxes to live more efficiently in urban or shared housing.A lot of the ideas I&#x27;m spouting off here are from organizations like StrongTowns. They and others like them have been doing a great job of putting words into action, but we need many more people to be in this movement and we shouldn&#x27;t promote infighting on details. Individual change is great, but it will not change anything at scale. The same thing goes for climate and general social progress. We need to force change at the government level, and stopping the subsidization of car infrastructure is just one step in that long process. reply Arelius 15 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t it a bit audacious to assume the parent lives in a suburban home with a yard and drives a car?

That e-bike is designed to take a substantial amount of cargo, or two kids.I can get to the post office, polling place, local deli, library, and a bar in about 5 minutes. The supermarket, pharmacy, pizza shops, restaurant, bank, hardware store etc in 15 minutes. A friend I visit regularly is 15 miles away which I consistently do in under 40 minutes versus about 25-30 in the car, even though the route I take to avoid a single-lane undivided highway is longer.Yes, a lot of rural&#x2F;suburban neighborhoods are isolated by wildly unsafe roads between them and services. But in many, it&#x27;s very easy to get to many of the places you need to go, via bicycle. reply hedora 10 hours agoparentprevI think you need to check your math. There are 14 times more of these electric mopeds, etc than cars, but they only have 4x more impact than the EVs. So one EV displaces about 3.5x more carbon emissions than the mopeds.To make the 2030 halve our emissions deadline, and 2050 net zero deadline with just little city vehicles, we’ll need to abandon the suburbs, exurbs and rural buildings and infrastructure that we already have, and replace it without producing any additional emissions. Also, in the US, most cities that experienced significant growth after ~ 1950 need to have their new parts razed and rebuilt to accommodate public transit routes and add walkable amenities.None of that can possibly happen at sufficient scale in the next 7 years, and it certainly would have massive environmental impact if it did.Alternatively, we could switch all cars to EV’s, use existing construction and infrastructure, and get a > 75% reduction in transportation carbon, even without cleaning up the power grid.In reality, we are already cleaning up the grid, and time of use subsidies are doing a good job of moving time-shiftable demand to high-production times, when the grid is cleaner.EVs are currently one of the biggest, easy to time shift loads.So, we can have a 90% solution to transportation carbon, or go for a 97.5% improvement (rounding the 3.5x improvement moving to mopeds would give up to 4x), but then emit way more carbon than total transportation emissions while we rebuild an unprecedented number of cities all at once.I’m all for public transit, and think all new urban &#x2F; suburban housing should be built along high capacity transit corridors, but doing that isn’t going to solve global warming in time. reply camgunz 44 minutes agorootparentI basically agree. We can&#x27;t rebuild our cities in 7 years, so we have to \"patch\" cars to be zero emissions. How do you get tens of millions of people to do that in 7 years though? Keep in mind average yearly income is something like $45k and most Americans have less than $500 in savings--not exactly a market ready to wholesale replace their cars.I think it&#x27;s clear that if you want to halve transportation emissions in 7 years you have to ban their current ICE car, and the only way you get away with that is to give them a comparable EV. We still have to build out mass transit and rezone everything, and also hit the mute button on NIMBYs everywhere, but short term you have to do a swap, like immediately. The money required for this is... astronomical, it&#x27;s at least trillions for an ICE&#x2F;EV swap, but you also need subsidies for auto manufacturers and developers, and you also need to weather the political storm of essentially stealing cars (a huge part of American culture) and putting grocery stores in the suburbs. reply Enginerrrd 10 hours agorootparentprevAlso I&#x27;d just like to add: everyone forgets that not everyone lives near an urban center.

In downtown SF I counted the number of people in cars backed up in a single city block. The traffic looked miserable. It was ~30 people, less than a single bus&#x27; ridership that passed by. The only way reducing the supremacy of cars in cities affects people who don&#x27;t live in \"concrete jungles\" is that they either have to pay for the externalities of their chosen transportation mode when they visit cities, or \"park and ride\" from the periphery into the the city proper.No one wants someone in a Montana ranch to take the bus.

The traffic reaches an equilibrium with the alternatives. I used to ride BART from Berkeley to SF every day, and it was consistently slower than the driving route despite being a straight shot.About the externalities, you already pay a lot to cross the more popular bridges into SF by car, you probably pay for parking, gasoline is taxed heavily, and the police don&#x27;t really protect your car from break-ins.

Those are common problems with buses, but they don&#x27;t have to be. A bus should not \"chugs along circuitously to a point that is not quite at your destination\" - design a better network. A bus should stop so close to where you shop that it is easier than carting that stuff to your car. A bus stop should not be so far away that bad weather is a problem. You should never miss your next leg because the next leg bus is never long in coming. The bus should always come.The only part of your list that your transit agency shouldn&#x27;t solve are the raving lunatic. This is easy to solve though as there are not many raving lunatics in the world and so the number of not lunatics riding great transit means they are rare (and there are plenty of others to help deal with them when they get on).Running great transit costs a lot more $$$ than most transit agencies get though, so they make the best of what money they have.

The only way driving ever ends up being less convenient is if there&#x27;s constrained parking.

We should not demand a reduction or stagnation in quality-of-life for developing countries either as it&#x27;s inhumane. Ostensibly they would be just as interested in pursuing renewable tech if it can help them grow. reply ska 15 hours agorootparent> is explicit that it is about taking away choice.But it&#x27;s a conversation and I am rejecting that framing. Suburbs&#x2F;Exurbs as practiced in US today aren&#x27;t some kind of quality of life maximizing end game. They are a natural result of a ton of policy interactions and subsidies, and the focus on it clearly has +ves and -ves. And of course it&#x27;s always nice if you can get someone else to partially pay for your lifestyle, but that&#x27;s inherently got downsides.I think that it lacks imagination to think that we can&#x27;t structure things differently and have equivalent or better quality of life overall. Will fewer people choose to live in suburbs? Sure - that&#x27;s how incentives work.I don&#x27;t think \"banning cars\" makes any sense. But if we stop basing policy at multiple levels centered around them, and stop subsidizing car-centered living, I suspect we&#x27;ll collectively do a lot less driving, which doesn&#x27;t seem like a bad outcome, and more likely to have +ve impact than the fantasy that EVs are a drop in replacement for ICEs, no other changes needed. reply slothtrop 15 hours agorootparent> Suburbs&#x2F;Exurbs as practiced in US today aren&#x27;t some kind of quality of life maximizing end gameNotwithstanding that the middle-class overwhelmingly prefers living in the suburbs. \"quiet\", \"safe\", etc.> I think that it lacks imagination to think that we can&#x27;t structure things differently and have equivalent or better quality of life overall.No one&#x27;s saying that. I fully support zoning reform. If one&#x27;s imagination leads to such bright ideas as \"ban cars\" however, it will have more detractors.> if we stop basing policy at multiple levels centered around them, and stop subsidizing car-centered living, I suspect we&#x27;ll collectively do a lot less drivingThat is possible and I support it also. reply ska 15 hours agorootparent> Notwithstanding that the middle-class overwhelmingly prefers living in the suburbs. \"quiet\", \"safe\", etc.Right, but they currently believe those things for reasons that are inexorably connected to those same policy choices.However, there is no reason to assume that if those policies change, peoples impressions and preferences won&#x27;t change too. Quite the opposite, actually - that&#x27;s just how incentives (and the related PR) work. reply slothtrop 15 hours agorootparent> Right, but they currently believe those things for reasons that are inexorably connected to those same policy choices.Only in the chicken-and-egg sense that policy choices make suburbia prioritized, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s enough to say that special policies are what wholly render suburbia quiet and safe (to the extent that if you were to enact the policy change you want, suburbia will still be regarded as such). reply ska 14 hours agorootparentQuiet I think is somewhat intrinsic, although the desirability of that is socially constructed, and changes over time. I also think people care about \"quiet house\" (which is to some degree a choice during construction) more than \"quiet neighbourhood\". The latter, after all, can be construed negatively or positively.\"Safety\" perception though seems to largely be a social construction. By this I mean it seems pretty clear (US context) that a) most people have opinions, often strong ones, about safety that b) don&#x27;t seem much related to any data or real science [1] and c) are quite often affected by softer things like political messaging and PR.If I&#x27;m right about the above, there would be no reason to assume it would not change also. Of course it also implies that change could not be driven by reality either :)[1] real science in this area seems inherently difficult, and available data of poor quality replyJAlexoid 15 hours agorootparentprevSuburban sprawl is both ecologically and financially unsustainable, with city dwellers subsidizing suburban living. reply treis 13 hours agorootparentThis is a widely believed factoid on the internets but is not supported by the numbers. Roads have always been a relatively small percentage of government spending and has been going down over time. The big ticket items for local & state governments are criminal justice, education, health, and in many areas pensions for retirees.This site has a good graph half way down showing the relative growth in spending by area:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.urban.org&#x2F;policy-centers&#x2F;cross-center-initiative.... reply david-gpu 15 hours agorootparentprevWhich adds salt to the wound because car traffic in denser areas is largely caused by the surrounding suburbs, as the locals can get to places by walking and transit, and often don&#x27;t even have a car. reply slothtrop 15 hours agorootparentprevTrivially resolved through zoning reform. Rhetoric surrounding \"banning cars\" will not deter sprawl or achieve anything of note, it will just be considered fringe fanaticism.> unsustainableThe global population growth rate is going to stall, and by extension, cities will cease to grow. Sustainability is a moot point. reply JAlexoid 15 hours agorootparent> Rhetoric surrounding \"banning cars\"Which I never engaged in. Banning cars is nonsense and is counter productive.> The global population growth rate is going to stallIf we give every person a car to drive every day, today - that&#x27;s enough to make it unsustainable. That&#x27;s the whole point. We don&#x27;t even have to have any growth in population. replybobajeff 16 hours agorootparentprevI also don&#x27;t live in a city with useable mass transit either. Bus routes take far longer to get to a place than by car and there are no train or subway lines nearby. Every place I&#x27;ve ever lived you needed a car to get around.That said, I would love it if I could get around this place without the need of a car. I would love it if my shopping centers were beautiful walkable areas with little shops I could get to on foot.Traffic sucks, driving sucks and my shopping center is a bunch of big box retail and grocery stores that spread out around neverending road construction far away from where I live.I don&#x27;t think things will ever get better either but eventually this common design pattern will severely screw us all over. reply bobbylarrybobby 16 hours agorootparentprevThe $20k car is not elitist but the $2k ebike is? Interesting. reply epistasis 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s always hilarious to me when people driving $60k vehicles ask me how much the ebike cost and say \"that&#x27;s expensive\". The ebike costs less than they pay in insurance a year, much less maintenance, gas, etc.Some people have weird ideas about cars being \"for regular people\" while any money spent on a bicycle is a luxury. reply riversflow 15 hours agorootparentI’ve driven a $3k car for almost 15 years. It has needed 3 sets of tires, 2 sets of front struts, a brake job, new power steering lines and a timing belt. I did all of that work, less the tires, myself. I spend about $1000 a year on insurance and registration.The utility I get out of the car, in absolute terms, is incomparable to my ~$1500 bicycle(that I purchased for utility and even commuted on for several years). I have slept in my car many times. My car has snacks, spare clothes and shoes, a blanket, a pillow, towels, pen and paper, bags for groceries, kick scooters, folding chairs, spare chargers and cables, amongst other things.Regular people need to bring things they own with them and take them back home. Bikes are trash for that. When I’m on my bike, my credit card serves the function of space. reply rckclmbr 14 hours agorootparentI agree that an ebike isn&#x27;t a replacement for a car in all circumstances. However, it is a replacement for a 2nd car. We have kids, groceries, vacations, beach trips, etc and have to have a car for. My wife usually has the carI use the ebike every day to commute, and for lots of groceries or coffee runs. I&#x27;ve ridden that (or my road bike) ~40k miles over the last 5 years. For the \"emergencies\" that I do need a 2nd car, I uber. I think I&#x27;ve done it 5 times in the last 5 years.In terms of dollars saved, at this point an ebike almost costs me nothing. I just use miles traveled * .55 for cost savings over a car.In terms of co2 saved, I don&#x27;t know but I consider it a win.In terms of life enjoyment, I&#x27;d MUCH rather be on my ebike than stuck in a box. reply epistasis 14 hours agorootparentprevSo you are not driving a $60k vehicle, living a life of luxury?I regularly bring things with me on my ebike because it has plenty of room to strap stuff on, and baskets that are handy for throwing stuff into it. I have a cheap bike trailer for moving bigger things that would require, say, a trunk.You were not the type of person who I am complaining about, but bikes are a great money saving device for most people, and should not be viewed as luxury items. reply cbozeman 15 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t carry four other people on my ebike, along with stuffing a minimum of one duffle bag per person, and usually being able to squeeze two in, along with a cooler for drinks, snacks, and sandwiches.My Telluride can do that though.Even if I could somehow fit all that shit onto an ebike, I wonder how long it and I would be able to make it before we give trying to go the 125 miles from Fort Worth to Possum Kingdom Lake...This site infuriates me sometimes at the complete and utter lack of understanding of most of the United States. reply epistasis 14 hours agorootparentAs somebody who has lived in many parts of the United States, your comment is infuriating to me.My family of four gets around great on bicycles, including when two of those members could not yet cycle themselves.You simply buy a bike that allows easy carrying of little people and all your baggage. Instead of some silly road bike or mountain bike that is meant for sport.You don&#x27;t see me making up complaints about the impossibility of transporting a finally by car because a Lotus can&#x27;t fit them all.Or how a car can&#x27;t go from SF to Hawaii. Why would you ever buy a car if it can&#x27;t support that vacation, right?These are ridiculous complaints not connected to reality or towards actually looking at the high value that various modes of transport can provide. reply webdood90 14 hours agorootparentprev> This site infuriates me sometimes at the complete and utter lack of understanding of most of the United StatesMost of the US in what capacity? Square miles? Because the majority of the population lives in Cities.I love reading comments like yours. All throughout this thread you&#x27;ve vehemently argued that your perspective is the right one.It&#x27;s a reminder to me that close minded people like you actually exist! You&#x27;re not here to discuss, you&#x27;re here to argue. That&#x27;s pretty unfortunate. reply lotsoweiners 11 hours agorootparentSaying the majority lives in cities is pretty BS though. They aren’t all living in walkable downtowns like Manhattan but rather are living in places like Houston, Phoenix, or Denver that have a few sq miles of what many would consider walkability, very spotty public transportation, and weather for part of the year that keeps all but the insane from wanting to walk to their destination. reply InSteady 6 hours agorootparentOh how the goalposts doth shift. We are talking about ebiking, not walking. Those of us who are mindful of ecology, climate, and urbanism know lack of walkability is a problem. It doesn&#x27;t have to be, but it is. It is another issue worth addressing at the policy and funding level.If people can walk for some of their trips 50-80% of the year and ebike for most of the rest, that is a huge win even if not everyone can adapt to the &#x27;unbearable&#x27; sacrifices that go along with that kind of change. \"But not literally everyone can do it so it&#x27;s a terrible suggestion and you are an elitist.\" Ok cool. reply itsoktocry 15 hours agorootparentprev>The ebike costs less than they pay in insurance a year, much less maintenance, gas, etc.Let me just get on my eBike and cruise the streets in the 4+ months we have snow, and 6+ months it&#x27;s cold.We don&#x27;t all live in California. reply epistasis 14 hours agorootparentYou don&#x27;t even address a single aspect of my comment.Why is my cheaper bike a \"luxury\" while it allows me to save tons of money in insurance and gas, while the elitist in a super expensive car considers a very practical piece of gear a luxury? reply barbazoo 15 hours agorootparentprevThere are certainly regions where the weather is impractical to commute or run errands on bikes. But often all one needs is the proper gear and some willingness to change habits. reply david-gpu 15 hours agorootparentprevI live in Toronto and, like many other people in cold areas, bike year round. Biking is warmer than walking, and the streets aren&#x27;t exactly empty in winter either. reply __MatrixMan__ 16 hours agorootparentprevNo it&#x27;s just physics. Carrying around an extra several thousand pounds of steel will always be a burden on more than just the one doing it. reply itsoktocry 16 hours agorootparentprev>Not everyone lives in large cities with whole mass transit systems or works the usual 9-5. Even in large urban areas it&#x27;s tricky to get around past a certain time. I remember working unexpected shifts and later staring at closed metro stations, having to walk in the rain to get home.These conversations are difficult to have here.You get people from large metropolitan areas who have no clue how \"the deplorables\" live, making calls to \"ban cars\".\"I can walk around and talk to my neighbours and it&#x27;s so quiet!\". Yeah, I have all that where I live, and I own two cars. reply macNchz 15 hours agorootparentHaving grown up in a rural place, I’d say the way infrastructure is built in America arguably serves the rural poor the worst. Totally dependent on cars to go anywhere, with effectively no choice but to spend a large portion of your income on a likely old and and unreliable vehicle, to get to a job that will happily fire you for being late if you have a problem with it. Once upon a time even quite small rural towns had actual shops, trains, even trams, that people could live nearby to, but we’ve mostly gotten rid of those. reply CalRobert 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty elitist to make me pay for your parking in my city. reply stouset 16 hours agorootparentprev> That&#x27;s very elitist.No, it is a fact. That it doesn’t align with the choices you’ve made in your life doesn’t change that.> Not everyone lives in large cities with whole mass transit systems or works the usual 9-5.Tell me you’ve never been outside the US before without telling me you’ve never been outside the US before.Joking aside (there are plenty of other countries with transit as bad as the US), plenty of other countries have figured out how to make public transit and alternative forms of transit (bikes, scooters) widely practical. Many places have optimized themselves for car travel, and if we want any chance of a livable world 100 years from now, we need to start optimizing for a different reality.Yes, we will never get rid of cars entirely. But we must find a way to get rid of cars for the 95%+ of trips that are part of day to day life (groceries, errands, commuting).A car-centric lifestyle is incompatible with a livable planet. Deal with it, my kids aren’t ditching for Mars or TRAPPIST-1 or whatever. reply cbozeman 15 hours agorootparent> A car-centric lifestyle is incompatible with a livable planet.No it isn&#x27;t. We just haven&#x27;t figured it out yet. Those aren&#x27;t the same thing. reply JAlexoid 15 hours agorootparentThey take up a lot of space and require a lot more energy to move around. Even if we get 100% electric vehicles with all clean power generation - it&#x27;s still a massive toll on the environment.A car isn&#x27;t a helicopter, they require reasonably good roads with high costs of maintenance(and a lot of other infrastructure to support roads).Also car dependent lifestyle means that population density drops, with less walkable places than ever. reply slothtrop 15 hours agorootparentprev> A car-centric lifestyle is incompatible with a livable planet.There&#x27;s no reason to believe this.Unsustainability is only ever a result of perpetually growing demand, or demand growing faster than technological innovation. Global population growth rate is projected to stagnate in 100 years, so it&#x27;s a moot point, and from a purely engineering perspective, emissions are a solved problem. The real issue is that emission are poised to rise in the short-run because demand is growing so fast in east Asia (and to a lesser extent through immigration to the West).This is a near-term problem, unsustainability doesn&#x27;t belong in the conversaiton. The question is really whether we want to weather that strain with current trajectory, or spend and implement policies to mitigate the climate effects during that period. reply KennyBlanken 14 hours agorootparentprevOver 80% of the US population lives in an densely populated area and RE-establishing public transit is not even remotely an insurmountable challenge logistically.The only thing standing in the way of mass transit are congressional representatives from rural areas representing counties that have less population than one square mile",

Best Game of All Time —PC Gamer Computer Game of the Year —AIAS Best Action Game —Game Critics Awards Greatest Game of All Time —GameSpy Readers Quantum Leap Award —Gamasutra Best Game of All Time —PC Gamer Computer Game of the Year —AIAS Best Action Game —Game Critics Awards Greatest Game of All Time —GameSpy Readers Quantum Leap Award —Gamasutra Game of the Month —PC Gamer December 1998 Valve invites you to experience the Half-Life 25th Anniversary Update Game updates, bug fixes, and new content! Get it now on Steam! Brand New Interviews With the HL1 Dev Team! We got the band back together to celebrate this anniversary, and we invited the fine people at Secret Tape to film it all happening. Getting together after all this time was the perfect opportunity to revisit the game as it existed in its earliest forms, and to talk about how and why it eventually took shape the way it did. Check out the film to see what it was like to be a part of the team, way back then. The 25th Anniversary Update for Half-Life Includes: Half-Life Uplink Originally released as a CD exclusive for magazines and hardware manufacturers, this mini-campaign was built by the Half-Life team right after the game went gold. As this was many people's first experience with Half-Life, we thought it was finally time to bundle it with the main game—no sound card purchase necessary. 4 New Multiplayer Maps Built by Valve level designers, these new maps push the limits of what's possible in the Half-Life engine. Contamination Two-foot-thick steel doors block off access to this contaminated waste facility, which has questionable scientific goals at best. Strap on a gluon gun and roast all intruders. Pool Party Enjoy a relaxing stay at this abandoned Xen outpost built around a cluster of soothing healing pools free-floating in space. How do you breathe here? It doesn't matter! Disposal Processing Area 3, a massive radioactive waste plant gone quiet. Tons of room for you and your colleagues to do experiments with a Tau Cannon or some hand grenades. Rocket Frenzy The creaking weight of this decaying orbital satellite launch facility somehow feels familiar… If we could switch on the oxygen lines, power, and fuel, we might just be able to light this candle. Updated Graphics Settings Play the game the way it looked in 1998, but on a modern monitor. Widescreen field of view! Option to disable texture smoothing on the GL renderer! Lighting fixes including the long-lost GL Overbright support! Software rendering on Linux! Crisp colors, animated water, and unfiltered textures! Controller and Steam Networking Support A proper gamepad config out of the box! Added support for Steam Networking! Invite your friends or join games instantly with no fuss. Steam Deck Support! We finally put our game through our own “Verified” tests, and... we failed super hard. So we fixed it! After re-testing the game, Half-Life gets to officially wear the green checkmark. Now you can play Half-Life on the best handheld gaming computer in the world in glorious 800p with improved controls and UI. UI Scaling Support for Higher Resolutions The entire UI has been reworked to scale at larger screen sizes. We built most of this stuff for 640x480 CRTs and apparently some of you have upgraded since then. Restored Content We brought back the classic Valve logo video with its iconic music and reskinned the menu to match the 1998 build. Original Main Menu Artwork Valve Logo Intro Video Ivan the Space Biker and Proto-Barney After all this time we finally shipped the original heroes from the alpha builds of Half-Life, available as multiplayer skins! As Well as These Rarely-seen Extras! In 1999, Valve released a CD called Half-Life: Further Data at retail stores, and we're finally including much of that content. Three Multiplayer Maps Double Cross Rust Mill Xen DM Two MP Player Models The Half-Life: Further Data CD also included some multiplayer skins made by the original team; we've brought back this incredible skeleton (now with tintable eyes!) and fan-favorite Too Much Coffee Man. Dozens of Sprays While playing a bunch of multiplayer matches we kept wanting more sprays... So we grabbed several megabytes of them from the Further Data release! Bug Fixes and Change Notes Now Verified on the Steam Deck (and our native Linux runtime has been set as the default). Half-Life: Uplink — the original standalone Half-Life demo — has been added to the game, and is accessible through the \"New Game\" menu. Added four all-new Half-Life Deathmatch maps: contamination, pool_party, disposal, and rocket_frenzy Added three old Half-Life Deathmatch maps formerly available only on the \"Half-Life: Further Data\" CD: doublecross, rust_mill, xen_dm. Added Ivan the Space Biker, Prototype Barney, Skeleton, and Too Much Coffee Man as player models to Half-Life Deathmatch. Added dozens of new sprays formerly available only on the \"Half-Life: Further Data\" CD. Added support for Steam Networking, allowing easy multiplayer via Steam's Join Game and Invite features. Added support for Steam Friends Rich Presence, allowing your friends to follow your journey through Black Mesa. Brought back the original Valve Intro video. Can be skipped with the \"-novid\" launch command. Updated main menu to a design inspired by the game's original 1998 main menu. Changed the default models to the original (non \"HD\") models. Improved physics for throwing grenades. Improved randomness for initial spawn points in multiplayer. Improved satchel charge controls: primary fire now always throws a new satchel, and secondary fire always detonates. Fixed push-able entity movement being based on framerate. Fixed players with high framerates freezing in place on death in multiplayer. Fixed some cases where the player could get stuck in place on level transitions. Fixed some cases where characters would interrupt important dialogue with their \"greetings\" dialogue. Fixed weapon view-bob angles. Fixed red barrels at the start of Surface Tension not launching as intended. Fixed Snarks attacking FL_WORLDBRUSH entities (such as func_walls). Fixed players sometimes failing to deploy a snark while crouching and looking down. Fixed certain convars (\"pausable\" and \"sv_maxspeed\") being set to incorrect values when entering a singleplayer game after a multiplayer game. Fixed singleplayer auto-aim setting being changed when entering a multiplayer game that disallows auto-aim. Fixed the flashlight HUD showing empty after loading a savegame. Fixed rockets in CONTENTS_SKY not always detonating. Fixed incorrect bullet impact sounds for NPCs. Fixed gauss gun making a loud static noise if it was charged across level transitions. Fixed a crash in mods that display keybinds in their UI. Fixed singleplayer weapons not auto-switching away when exhausted (grenades / snarks / satchels / etc) Fixed interpolation artifacts when animated models are moved by other entities. Fixed some buffer overflow exploits. Main-menu background and buttons have been reskinned, and now scale based upon screen resolution without stretching, supporting background image layouts up to 3840x1600. In-Game HUD now uses double or triple sized sprites when playing at higher resolutions. UI dialogs and in-game fonts now scale to improve readability at high screen resolutions. In-Game HUD HEV suit display has been shifted to the left of the screen, and no longer changes position at larger screen resolutions. Added an \"Enable texture filtering\" setting. Added an \"Allow widescreen Field of View\" setting to correct non-anamorphic FOVs, for widescreen and ultrawide displays. Re-organized all the Settings screens to improve legibility, and support controller navigation. Updated the Pause menu to be aware of the current gameplay mode. The default server name and multiplayer player name are now based on the player's Steam Persona. The Steam platform menu has been removed, now that all its features are in Steam itself. Fixed application icon rendering incorrectly when using the software renderer. Fixed player and spray images not updating their coloring on the settings screen. Removed the now very unnecessary \"Low video quality. Helps with slower video cards.\" setting. Improved support for keyboard and controller navigation everywhere. Added \"Lower Input Latency\" option: Synchronizes the CPU and GPU to reduce the time between input and display output. Fixed issues that caused jerky mouse / joystick input. (We basically rewrote it all - if you've got a custom Steam Input controller configuration, you should rebuild it from our newly published Official Configuration). Increased the 357 damage from 40 → 50. Hive Hand reload time has been reduced from 0.5s → 0.3s per shot, and it will be selected at higher priority than the pistol on pickup. MP5 now always starts it with full ammo when picked up. Players no longer drop empty weapons, and any that are dropped are reloaded by what's in the dying player's backpack. Improved client-side prediction to reduce \"ghost shots\". Like Counter-Strike, consider hitboxes and not just bounding boxes for hits on the client. Fixed network predicted crowbar swing damage being incorrect. Added supported for UI Sprites and Texture files larger than 256x256. Added support for UI Font special render modes: \"blur\" and \"additive\". Added setting to turn off texture filtering when using the OpenGL renderer. Default resolution is now based on the resolution of the desktop, instead of a 640x480 window. Default gamma has been decreased from 2.5 → 2.2, now that we aren't all playing on CRTs. Software renderer will now correctly filter out incompatible resolutions, unless there is only 1 resolution available on the display. Restored OpenGL overbright support. Fixed fullscreen software renderer crashing on systems that don't support 16-bit color. Fixed software renderer being stretched when using widescreen resolutions. Fixed skyboxes and sky color incorrectly carrying over when transitioning maps in multiplayer. Fixed the game appearing too dark after modifying video settings. Fixed MSAA in windowed mode. Fixed mipmap rendering on studio models. Fixed gluon gun sprite rendering in multiplayer. Fixed gluon gun sinusoidal noise being incorrect. Various optimizations to support the newly increased engine limits. OpenGL optimizations for the Steam Deck. Increased maximum limit of dynamic sound channels from 8 → 32. Increased maximum limit of sentences in the sentences.txt file from 1536 → 2048. Increased maximum number of entities (MAX_EDICTS) from 900 → 1200. Increased MAX_PACKET_ENTITIES increased from 256 → 1024. Increased MAX_GLTEXTURES from 4800 → 10000. Increased software renderer geometry limits: max spans 3000 → 6000, max surfaces 2000 → 4000, and max edges 7200 → 14400. Cycler and func_button entities can now be the entity target for scripted_sentence entities, and are allowed to speak in multiplayer. Incorporated func_vehicle entity support from Counter-Strike, for mod-makers to use. Full SDK update will come later, but level designers can use it now. Added support for the software renderer. Improved font rendering. Many stability and behavior fixes. Localization files updated. Miscellaneous security fixes. The previous version of the game has been archived to a publicly visible Beta branch named \"steam_legacy\", with the description \"Pre-25th Anniversary Build.\" If a mod or feature is behaving in an unexpected way, you may need to run this archived build until the issue is resolved in the default build. We now consider this anniversary version of Half Life to be the definitive version, and the one we'll continue to support going forward. Therefore, we'll be reducing the visibility of Half Life: Source on the Steam Store. We know Half-Life: Source's assets are still being used by the Source engine community, so it'll remain available, but we'll be encouraging new Half-Life players to play this version instead.

The engine can also run other games and works on mobile devices with less common screen resolutions, but YMMV. For a while, it was a good fallback to the official game if you were having a problem with it on new or less-supported hardware, but with this anniversary release, maybe it is less \"necessary\" and more \"cool\" to use an OSS alternative engine. reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentprevMost engine reworks like that (Doom, Age of Empires, Heroes III, etc) offer significantly improved performance and scaling for modern computers.There are often other enhancements, too, including native support for Mac, Linux, etc. reply SXX 10 hours agorootparentAs one of authors of Heroes III one I could say Xash3D is amazing project worth to check for Source 1 game fans.Valve support for their old games is outstanding and they all have native support, great performance, constant updates.

I used keyboard only, with page up&#x2F;down keys for vertical look. When Half-Life came out my friend would only let me play if I looked with the mouse instead. I thought that was so dumb. Why not just use both sides of the keyboard? Why split controls across two devices? But I relented and picked up this wonky control scheme pretty quickly. Then I bought my own copy and wore it down to the nubs over the course of years. I loved mods. My favorite was Action Half-Life. I played Counterstrike a few times when Xena Warrior Princess posters were plastered around maps and scientists acted as hostages.

It&#x27;s no keyboard+mouse, but it&#x27;s close enough for me, that unlike with the analogue sticks, I don&#x27;t find myself needing to reduce difficulty levels or enable any kind of aim-assist.I sometimes find myself wishing I had a controller with the same layout as the deck that I could use when I have it docked to my TV. reply ascagnel_ 4 hours agorootparent> I sometimes find myself wishing I had a controller with the same layout as the deck that I could use when I have it docked to my TV.You can pair basically most first-party controllers for the PS4, PS5, XSX&#x2F;XSS, and Nintendo Switch (the exception being the original non-Bluetooth Xbox One controller) to the Deck, should you have one laying around. reply anotherhue 14 hours agorootparentprev:) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;USB-C-HDMI-Cable-10-feet&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B088T8D5C... reply TheCraiggers 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve seen people use a combination of both.

This is what drove me to build my first computer and after debugging my way through all the issues that a 12 a year old would make when building a computer before the age of YouTube, I remember being absolutely blown away by the lighting and speed of what this little piece of hardware added to the experience.That wasn&#x27;t the first time I felt the rush of getting a computer to do something I wanted (that would probably be getting doom running in windows 3.1 after dealing figuring out the mystical \"command line\") but it certainly was one of the most drastic in just how fast tech changed.A small addendum to this... I really want to figure out how to bring similiar experiences to my kids, because it was that loop of problem -> learning -> breakthrough that I think was hugely transformative to not only my career trajectory, but also just in learning to love learning.So thanks Valve and Half-Life team for this happy memories... but maybe I won&#x27;t feel the same when I try and play HL DM this weekend and inevitably realize how slow my reaction times have gotten in the last ~25 years ;) reply hgs3 14 hours agoprevOne of the level designers, Dario Casali, marked the 25th anniversary with a complete playthrough and commentary.

Valve&#x27;s cut of game sales is massive, and a competitor could easily slash into that to undercut them. Which is what Epic Games is trying to do.

I can see why they wouldn&#x27;t want to rush quickly to the exit but at the same time, HL2E2 left them without much wiggle room. This issue alone is addressed in Half-Life Alyx.From Valve&#x27;s perspective, the Half-Life property is pretty valuable and its served them well as a means of demonstrating the newest source engine updates with a ton of hype bootstrapped because it is Half-Life.Despite it&#x27;s popularity, Half-Life is a delicate property in the sense that the story hinges on a lot of unknowns that are not revealed straight forwardly, similarly to LOST, the lack of detail stokes that mystery to the audience&#x27;s delight, because they know there will be a big payoff that explains these mysteries at the end of the tunnel. That&#x27;s a lot of pressure for the writers room @ Valve, especially so considering the development process of the game engine&#x2F;assets itself.It works for Valve. It sucks for fans, but the alternative is ending the property early or extending the property far beyond its intended shelf life. As long as I live to see the end of the narrative, I&#x27;ll be happy. If not, then valve pls fix. reply pitched 8 hours agorootparentprevNo insider info again but, IMHO, Half Life: Alyx was a genre-defining success that has not yet been matched but even that did not hit the bar expected of a Half Life 3. It’s an impossible expectation and they don’t have a financial need to try. reply fullshark 15 hours agorootparentprevI think part of the issue is Half-life 1 & 2 were groundbreaking in terms of level design and storytelling in a FPS. It wasn&#x27;t just about completing a maze, that was why Half-Life was so beloved there was nothing like it really before. Half-life 3 would just be like every other FPS game now, the trail has been blazed. reply xcv123 14 hours agorootparent> Half-life 3 would just be like every other FPS game nowArtistically, aesthetically, nothing quite compares to the Half Life universe in other FPS games. A lot of people would be happy with just another chapter to explore.There are too many open world boring grinding simulations nowadays.Black Mesa was just a remake of Half Life 1 and it was so much more fun and immersive than any recent FPS game that I have played. reply zavertnik 14 hours agorootparentI think a lot of the special sauce with the Half Life games is their \"Show don&#x27;t tell\" approach to game design.You load up the game, watch an intro (for games after HL1) and boom you&#x27;re in the game. Nothing is going to appear on your screen beyond your HUD except for one time tips when acquiring a new weapon and chapter titles when progressing to a new level. Everything happens in real time and everything always happens from the POV of the player. There are no cut scenes, there are no cinematic transitions, and the player&#x27;s POV is never intercut with cameras&#x2F;external perspectives.It makes the games feel grounded and more cinematic, IMO. Its a game design language that really puts the onus on the player to witness the story and game for themselves. When I play a Half-Life or Portal game, I feel like I&#x27;m discovering the story as I play, while other games often feel like I&#x27;m being presented or shown a story as I play. The execution is more nuanced than that, but the game&#x27;s simplicity makes it difficult to focus on anything other than the story and world within the game.When you look at the stories of each Half-Life game, each game tends to follow the same structure with the same kind of plot points. But for me, it never feels repetitive because the experience of witnessing the story is different for each game. Of course Half-Life isn&#x27;t the only game that does this and this of course isn&#x27;t the only reason why Half-Life has been enshrined as one of the GOATs.The underlying content of the game, its aesthetic, the textures and models, sound design and score, voice acting, ect. all are great in Half-Life, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that Half-Life is the best at any of these things. I also wouldn&#x27;t say the game&#x27;s narrative is the best of the best either. Despite this it remains my all time favorite game franchise, possibly&#x2F;probably because I grew up with it but also because the game does a fantastic job of using that underlying content to give little clues. Everything feels like it has a purpose, whether it is apparent in the moment or not.But I am just a storyteller that happens to be a barely competent programmer with absolutely no experience in game development, so all of this is just my opinion based on my own experience! reply kibibu 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you can get your hands on a VR headset, I cannot recommend Alyx highly enough.

They could have made a ton of money with that cliff hanger if they remained like every other game developer on the planet, instead of a metric buttload of money. reply cogman10 14 hours agorootparentOpportunity cost? Steam was created shortly after half-life 1 and existed prior to half life 2&#x27;s release. It was already a huge cash cow when they released games like CS go and TF2.But further, the skills to write a game are different from the skills to manage a game distribution system. It&#x27;s not like by having the HL2 devs valve was squeezed for cash or resources to expand steam. replykeybpo 14 hours agoprev [–] I love the fact that on the games requirements on the Steam page it still says it runs on Windows XP when in fact all support has been cut for long now, leaving out many of us who got into Steam on the first place because we either wanted a legal digital copy of our physical collection or because many physical game keys WOULD also activate a digital license. I still keep Windows 8 because it&#x27;s still supported on Steam but that too will change in january 1st next year. The irony is even sweeter, given that this update should very well work on period correct machines (which again, many of us still keep running) but alas, you&#x27;ll still locked out.We&#x27;d gladly trade all the distractions the client forces down our throat (stickers, trading cards, avatars and all of that stuff) for the ability to single play the games we legitimately bought. But that&#x27;s not an option we have, unlike say GOG, who also doesn&#x27;t support old OS but at least gives us the possibility to download the games.

    "title": "Battery Prices for Electric Vehicles Expected to Drop 40% by 2025",
    "originLink": "https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/electric-vehicle-battery-prices-falling.html",
    "originBody": "It wasn’t long ago rising demand and component shortages sparked concern that “greenflation” would drive up prices for the batteries used in electric vehicles. That’s subsiding as prices cool for battery metals, which could help make EVs more competitive with traditional cars more quickly. Goldman Sachs Research now expects battery prices to fall to $99 per kilowatt hour (kWh) of storage capacity by 2025 — a 40% decrease from 2022 (the previous forecast was for a 33% decline). Our analysts estimate that almost half of the decline will come from declining prices of EV raw materials such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt. Battery pack prices are now expected to fall by an average of 11% per year from 2023 to 2030, writes Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Goldman Sachs Research’s Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, in the team’s report. As battery prices fall, Goldman Sachs Research estimates the EV market could achieve cost parity, without subsidies, with internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles around the middle of this decade on a total-cost-of-ownership basis. “The reduction in battery costs could lead to more competitive EV pricing, more extensive consumer adoption, and further growth in the total addressable markets for EVs and batteries,” says Bhandari. The EV market was initially driven by regulatory support around the world, but global EV penetration is starting to retreat from recent highs, a potential driver of which could be governments in Europe and China cutting back on subsidies. Still, our analysts see the EV market transitioning to a new phase that is more heavily influenced by consumer adoption than government largesse as battery prices drop. The team’s base case estimate for global EV penetration jumps to 17% in 2025 from just 2% in 2020, and to 35% and 63% by 2030 and 2040, respectively. But its “hyper adoption” scenario sees EVs accounting for 21% of total global vehicle sales by 2025, 47% by 2030, and 86% by 2040. So far China is leading the way — its EVs are more competitively priced against ICEs in its local market relative to Europe and the US. While EV sales there have been subsidized by Chinese EV producers, which are selling EVs at a loss, the Goldman Sachs Research expects this to eventually change in around the middle of the decade, when battery price declines and a scale-up in EV sales volumes lead to a significant reduction in EV costs. And whereas Chinese consumers are seeing more options of competitively priced EVs, carmakers in the US and Europe have so far focused on larger and more luxurious EV models. “We believe the EV market in China could be the closest to a consumer-led EV adoption phase,” Bhandari says. Our analysts also credit new battery technologies for their forecast of a more rapid decline in battery prices. The report highlights a handful of EV battery innovations that could be commercialized this decade, creating “pockets of strength” along the battery value chain. These include novel anode materials featuring silicon that replace or blend with graphite and improve energy density. Bhandari also notes there are new battery structures such as those that increase the size of each battery cell (large cylindrical batteries) that help simplify the pack manufacturing process, “leading to a meaningful savings of labor and machine time.” This article is being provided for educational purposes only.

Now I would like to see western car manufacturers lower prices of EVs in unison.Remember how in the 90s the intel pc completely overwhelmed and completely destroyed several layers of computing competitors. Intel and their PC manufacturing bretheren did that by providing a decent quality product at the lowest price. Then they used the benefits of manufacturing scale to improve the price quality ratio to the point where the intel PCs were higher performance than even the fancy work stations that cost 10 times as much.Well the chinese are about to do that with EVs. EVs are very similar to PCs in this respect, because they have a lot of potential for manufacturing efficiencies.Western manufacturers (other than Tesla) should drop their prices and try to get to scale as soon as possible.

Prices are dropping not because of rabid competition that tries and succeeds in one-upping each other with better cheaper tech.No, instead demand is rapidly drying up, because suddenly people realize most EVs are vastly, vastly inferior to what they were supposed to replace. The only EVs that make sense are small ones, small battery, for urban transport without the emissions, so you can keep the city air clean.From that point on, the bigger you get, the worse it gets. Notice that although Tesla has sold several million sedan&#x2F;compacts and... uhmm \"SUVs\" (really: just slightly bigger Model 3s), they keep postponing the CyberTruck and Semi. They&#x27;ve only made 90 Semis and avoiding mass production. CyberTruck also won&#x27;t be in mass production for at least a year more as they test the market (expect several thousand sold).That&#x27;s because no amount of hype can hide the facts for too long. These cars are expensive to buy, but way more expensive to own. Insurance is shooting up to the sky as they have to write off entire cars over minor damage because they dented the battery and this sh*t can&#x27;t be fixed.EVs will also be increasingly a liability when parked tightly below residential buildings, malls, ferries and so on.

For the most part, you don&#x27;t need an ICE car for long road trips anymore. Even in places like Big Sur, Mendocino, there are superchargers. Even in the worst situations, like near Carmel, rolling up to a supercharger on a busy weekend that&#x27;s packed, with a line of a dozen cars, you&#x27;re still in an out in an amount of time I normally see with rest stops. Biggest problem for me has always been just wrangling everyone back into the car!I&#x27;ve almost never spent longer than 15 minutes charging on long car trips, unless we&#x27;re also going to a restaurant. And even then, we usually don&#x27;t have to, and could have made it a 15 minute stop if we wanted to. Most of the time, the car is done charging enough faster than we could stop for coffee, and I have to extend the charge using my app.That said, there was one occasion in a trip through Big Sur, when the Ventana supercharger went offline, when I did a 45 minute charge session, and I drove 30 minutes out of the way to catch a supercharger on another occasion. So 2 occasions like that in nearly 3 years.The situation is pretty good now.

Do you know why? Because IT DOESN&#x27;T NEED A BATTERY.The battery is the single most fragile, heavy, dangerous, expensive, stressful (\"range anxiety\") and annoying component of an EV, and one which degrades at an alarming rate, just by using it normally.Guess what, a fuel tank doesn&#x27;t shrink every time you fill it.And it doesn&#x27;t shrink even FASTER when you fill it to the top.Or let it go empty.Or run in cold weather.Or hot weather.Or you drive fast.Or too slow.Or when you fill the tank too fast. Where \"too fast\" is dripping it in for 30 to 60 minutes a pop.Or when you don&#x27;t drive the car for too long.On top of that, the starting range of the top BEV is half an ICE car.

And people are slowly realizing that. reply Turskarama 10 hours agorootparentprevThe problem with BEVs isn&#x27;t actually any single vehicle, BEVs really are good enough for anyone, today. The real issue is going to be scaling up battery manufacturing to the point that we make enough for everyone to have a BEV, which really is not as much of a given as people seem to assume.EV sales are still at only around 20% of the market, which is a lot! But given that the majority of lithium batteries are already going into EVs now total battery production needs to go up by something like a factor of 5 by 2030 just to meet EV sales. That&#x27;s a huge amount of growth for any industry, let alone high tech manufacturing.I would not be surprised to see the relative growth of EV sales stall soon as manufacturers have trouble sourcing enough batteries, and in response we may see some Hybrids or EREVs coming onto the market to meet the shortfall.

The reason being is that consumers have generally accepted the cost for cars at a certain level. Rather than dropping the price for cars, they add more features or improve quality to justify a certain price point.The average ICE engine hasn&#x27;t changed, from a technology standpoint, has not changed in decades. What&#x27;s changed is all the internal technology (entertainment systems, parking cameras) as well as trim that&#x27;s become standard (power everything). These standards are defined by the market. Case in point: see what the standard for cars (both quality and price) are for a given market like US vs India.It&#x27;s unlikely they will lower margins so much as to make less money from EV&#x27;s than from ICE cars. An analogous model are iPhones. The old iPhones could be sold today at a fraction of the price but instead they release new models with better features to justify the higher price point.(This is all with a caveat that I&#x27;m talking about sticker price. Given that EV maintenance should generally be cheaper, without a doubt the target is to have the total cost of ownership be lower than an ICE car as that&#x27;s how EV&#x27;s are being positioned today.) reply nicoburns 9 hours agorootparentThe traditional manufacturers might not, but EVs are lot simpler to make than ICE cars, and that might make it easier for new entrants to enter the market. At the moment that’s somewhat offset by the difficulty in and cost of procuring batteries, but once those become commodities I’d expect (some) EVs to be cheaper. reply grecy 13 hours agoparentprev> I’m curious at what point it will flip and EVs become cheaper than ICE If Tesla can pull off some of the manufacturing efficiencies and improvements they talked about at their last investor day, it seems very likely their up coming \"smaller\" vehicle will be exactly that. reply AtlasBarfed 5 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure Tesla is already there, they are milking the profits right now though.150 wh&#x2F;kg sodium ion and 200+wh&#x2F;kg LFP is going to be the workhorse of this price improvement. Sodium Ion should only be 30-40$&#x2F;kwhr, and 2025-ish is when CATL expects to hit 200wh&#x2F;kg sodium ion and 250 wh&#x2F;kg LFP.So its a double assault: higher density with cheaper materials. Waiting in the wings are solid state and sulfur techs among others.IMO what is needed is a gradual phase-out EV price credit (not a tax credit) that starts at $10,000 and drops $1000 per year. Meanwhile, ICE cars should get taxed at registration $500 extra and that increases $500 per year. reply oezi 2 hours agorootparentWhen will we see any consumer products utilizing sodium ion batteries at this price point? A 10kwh battery for less than 1000 USD certainly would change a lot of calculations around home solar. reply aaomidi 13 hours agoparentprevI feel like once the cost drops, it will be just in maintenance alone. reply cfeduke 13 hours agorootparent> it will be just in maintenance aloneCan confirm; >5 years on a Model 3 and other than tires $0 in maintenance so far. >3 years on a Model Y and other than tires, $0 in maintenance so far. Absolute huge cost and time savings compared to my ICE vehicles, even when I perform my own maintenance on them. reply toomuchtodo 13 hours agorootparentTesla will also come to my house (or any other address I specify within their service coverage area) with a mobile ranger to do the service I don&#x27;t want to do myself (brake fluid exchange every 2 years). I wish other automakers would offer this. Not EV specific, but a material improvement in user experience imho. Major work will still require a shop visit (dropping the HV battery pack, motor replacement, other major mechanicals).(I am aware of YourMechanic and other similar services, but having the unified experience with a brand is nice and fancy, I can order it in the Tesla app and the maintenance records can easily transfer to the next VIN owner) reply droopyEyelids 13 hours agorootparentIts an improvement to you but a lost sales opportunity for the dealer.Im surprised this isnt mentioned more, but dealers make a ton of money pressuring people who come in for maintenance to get a bunch of other stuff.According to NADA in 202 49% of dealership profits came from the service and parts department, 36% from new vehicle sales, and 14% from used sales.Service and parts averages 60-70% profit on the transactions. reply sunflowerfly 13 hours agorootparentWhile probably true, I would love to see the traditional car dealership business model go away. The only reason anymore to have a dealer is a place to test drive, and you do not need a huge lot full of cars for that. reply kccqzy 9 hours agorootparentTraditional brands sell many more SKUs than Tesla. It is likely they will need a large lot just to have all the variations in SKUs available for test drive. Tesla isn&#x27;t particularly good at their so-called \"demo drive\" actually. Last time I tried to test drive both AWD and RWD variations of the same model but they couldn&#x27;t do that. Needless to say I didn&#x27;t buy a Tesla. reply toomuchtodo 13 hours agorootparentprevGreat call out. They sell cars to capture future service revenue. This is why you can&#x27;t sell EVs effectively with a dealership model.

This isn&#x27;t unique here. reply agumonkey 12 hours agorootparentprevCar maintenance is such a huge burden. I don&#x27;t want see car mechanics out of job, but sincerely the amount of money wasted in parts is astonishing (included the high labour cost due to massive amount of parts and differences in configurations to deal with).Once the average person knows the maintenance cost is that low it will probably provide yet another inflection in EV curve adoption. reply tomcam 10 hours agorootparentAnd you’re being charitable here, because you are omitting the all-too-frequent case of work being done when it’s not necessary.

Some people do 350+ mile one way trips regularly, not \"once in a blue moon\" and EVs are just less convenent for them. I have trips like that at least monthly, sometimes weekly. I can do that on a single tank of fuel and not have to worry about finding a charger along the way or when I arrive or if my hotel will even have working chargers (I&#x27;m sure some hotels offer this but I personally have never seen it and I stay at moderately decent hotel like Hampton Inn). reply Zanni 5 hours agorootparentYou make a good point that different people have different needs, and everyone tends to argue from their own perspective. And, like you, I would not rely on hotel chargers.However ... if you drive a Tesla, there are very few places in the United States where you would have to \"worry about finding a charger along the way.\" Enter your destination in the nav, and it will pick a convenient Supercharger for you.You&#x27;re probably not planning on converting to a BEV anytime soon, but check out Tesla&#x27;s trip planner on your monthly 350+ mile drive. I think you&#x27;ll be surprised.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;trips reply BobaFloutist 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah but if charging stations become as ubiquitous as gas stations, this becomes a lot less of an issue.And quite frankly my 10-gallon tank has like a 400 mile range, and newer electric cars have like a 300 mile range, so the gap is getting pretty narrow. reply calvinmorrison 10 hours agorootparentprev95% of people commenting on this thread live within a short drive of the Amtrak North East corridor and absolutely should convert to an EV as fast as possible.

Remember to brake once in a while if you live in an area with salty roads. reply jjtheblunt 12 hours agorootparentthat sounds about right, but i was in unsalted territory! reply m463 9 hours agorootparentprevWell, no oil changes, but I suspect long-term there may be big things like on ICE cars. 12v battery, air conditioner, coolant changes (fewer), motor issues, big battery. There are a lot of electronics. Crashes might be fewer, but it seems the cars are expensive to fix. Hopefully there will be parts long-term, and repair infrastructure. reply moduspol 3 hours agorootparentI did have to have the 12v battery replaced on my 2018 Model 3, but I think they&#x27;ve now transitioned to Lithium-ion 12v batteries on the newer cars, so I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;ll be an expected maintenance item much longer. reply hinkley 13 hours agorootparentprevI think we should stop factoring our tires. EVs chew through tires because they’re heavy as hell.If we play at being objective and get caught leaving bits out, people shut down and label you a liar.I presume brakes and tires partially cancel out, depending on car model. Some vehicles do engine braking automatically (mine does). reply galcerte 13 hours agorootparentSUVs are being sold like candy, and they are heavier than your regular sedan. This is especially so in the US, where it&#x27;s not just SUVs but also trucks, and they are both bigger and heavier than in Europe. Being heavy is not exclusive to EVs. reply smileysteve 4 hours agorootparentprevTire store source tells me it&#x27;s not just the weight, but many drivers are aggressively regenerative breakers and enjoy their aggressive acceleration as well.We didn&#x27;t hear about tire wear as much on the Nissan leaf.We&#x27;ve taken 5% of cars that had 7+ second 0-60 times and replaced them with 3 second 0-60 cars. And we&#x27;ve removed the most direct cost of that acceleration (fuel). reply kwhitefoot 12 hours agorootparentprev> EVs chew through tires because they’re heavy as hell.Nonsense most EVs are very similar in weight to their ICE counterparts. My Model S weighs about 2 100 kg, a comparable sized ICE car such as an S-class Mercedes weighs slightly less to slightly more depending on which options you specify. reply slaw 12 hours agorootparentWhy do you compare Tesla Model S to a luxury car?

I&#x27;ve had exactly a cost of $1200 on it so far (not counting tires).I think that&#x27;s actually pretty decent. I think people also switch cars every 5-6 years too? reply michpoch 12 hours agoparentprevIt is a bit less of a milestone considering how inflated ICE prices became.Once they normalise EV prices will be still really far off. reply rafaelmn 12 hours agorootparentWhat makes you think they will drop ? reply resolutebat 14 hours agoprevThe article mentions lower cost of raw materials, but the other factor driving this is more efficient batteries. CATL is starting mass production of 500 Wh&#x2F;kg batteries, about twice as dense as the ones used today, which reduces the need for rare materials as well. reply jandrese 11 hours agoparentThis is exactly what we would expect to happen. There was a major supply crunch for batteries which incentivized people to build more battery factories which caused a projected crunch in the mining sector, but the mining sector saw the writing on the wall and started ramping production too.Now the battery costs are falling and in a few years we will probably see an oversupply situation which will be good times for anybody who uses batteries. I&#x27;m a bit hopeful about decarbonization efforts for the latter half of the decade. I think battery prices will drop enough to make grid storage viable in more places and further allow the deployment of wind and solar generation. As this article mentions EVs will see a major price drop in their most expensive component.Then of course a bunch of the manufacturers will go out of business because the prices dropped too low and then the market will consolidate into a couple of companies and prices will creep upward again as they fail to compete with each other. But that&#x27;s a problem for the future. reply cogman10 10 hours agorootparentFor the next 10 years, I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see an oversupply of batteries. There&#x27;s simply too many ready to deploy applications for them that will accelerate as cost comes down.Grid storage is the major one. As price starts to decline you are going to see power providers soak up any excess battery supply. reply calvinmorrison 10 hours agorootparentprevBattery recycling is also very good. Most all car batteries are recycled. Once you have enough lithium or whatever dug up, it&#x27;ll just get cheaper to recycle for the most part. reply fy20 4 hours agorootparentEV battery recycling is WIP right now. At the moment it&#x27;s still cheaper to dig up new lithium and cobalt, but I guess a lot of that is there just aren&#x27;t enough old batteries available to recycle to cover demand right now.There are companies that take old EV batteries and break then down. The steel and plastic is recycled. The valuable metals end up in one big lump right now, but as I understand they are storing them for future use as that part is still being commercially developed and they expect it to be valuable.If we take a look at lead acid batteries, the majority of the lead that is used in the manufacturing of new batteries comes from old batteries that are recycled. reply tonyedgecombe 1 hour agorootparentYes, I remember reading that lead acid batteries are the most recycled consumer item. Something like 97% are recycled. reply cogman10 14 hours agoparentprevThe other two things that are happening.* LFPs are really starting to take off which pull a lot of pressure off higher capacity NMC batteries.* Sodium ion batteries are just starting to hit the market which further reduce demands on Lithium.The ramp up on alternative chemistries is playing a fairly good role here and sodium ion will likely push prices down even more aggressively.Further, I expect that battery recycling will really start to be a major contributor to lower costs in the next 10 years or so. So I&#x27;d expect even lower prices as the battery market starts approaching saturation. reply paddy_m 13 hours agorootparentYou seem to know a lot about battery tech. What do you read to keep up to date? reply cogman10 13 hours agorootparentOh everywhere really. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been interested in for quiet a while. A battery related article was something I&#x27;d click on every time it came up on slashdot.Limiting factor [1] can be really good at breaking things down and covering current battery tech (they are fairly bullish on tesla). But I also get bits and pieces from google news feeds, renewable focused social media, and diving into anti-renewable social media :D. I don&#x27;t mind reading into a critical piece to challenge my preconceived notions.It does help, though, to simply know who the big players are and watch what they are actually manufacturing (and then read up on that tech). I mostly ignore the \"this battery is 8 billion times cheaper than lithium ion!\" news stories because they are sensationalist. An article about CATL building a solid state battery line and now I want to know what it is, how it works, and what the cons are.CATL is probably the most interesting manufacturer to watch if you want to know where the cutting edge is. (Similar to TSMC being cutting edge when it comes to chip manufacturing).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@thelimitingfactor reply stcredzero 9 hours agorootparentprevWatch \"The Limiting Factor\" channel on YouTube.

Won&#x27;t it become less so as new batteries become cheaper? reply cogman10 13 hours agorootparent> Is recycling even economical today?Very much so. I suggest watching the following video to see where we are at. [1]> Won&#x27;t it become less so as new batteries become cheaper?Recycling will be the key to making batteries even cheaper. Getting already refined iron, nickel, and other chemicals will be far cheaper than trying to mine these materials fresh.Very similar to how pretty much all lead acid batteries are recycled. Mining new lead is a lot more expensive than reusing old lead.Recycling isn&#x27;t always economical (see paper and plastic) but in the case of batteries, it absolutely is. The biggest problem battery recycle have is there&#x27;s simply not enough batteries to recycles.

With some chinese factories starting mass manufacturing sodium ion batteries this year. I think we are fast moving towards an electricity revolution because of how solar&#x2F;wind and battery prices are falling and a lot of people have still not woken up to the fact. Cost of solar and battery is going to be half in 5 years maybe even 1&#x2F;4 in 10 years. It is the similar thing as the doubling of processor speed we had for computer not as fast but similar. reply dns_snek 5 hours agoprevCool. Let me know when I can buy a used one for 10k and expect to drive it for another 10 years. reply 2wrist 13 hours agoprevIt is interesting. I read recently that the next generation of BMW&#x27;s (2026?) will have a 50% reduction on the cost of the battery. Hope it falls further. reply jjcm 14 hours agoprevNo surprise there. Increased demand -> increased economies of scale over time. What I&#x27;m really curious about is if a new battery with increased density heavily disrupts this. If you double density, then naively you need half the batteries &#x2F; half the materials, or half the cost. reply Tade0 13 hours agoparentThis works as long as the increases in density come from widening the range of voltages in which the battery is stable - that has happened in history with the advent of 4.35V cells (vs the previous figure of 4.2V@100% charge).Current approaches like silicon-enriched or pure lithium metal anodes indeed use less materials, but they&#x27;re decreasing the size of the less dense of the two electrodes, as the metal cathode is typically much denser and heavier than the graphite anode, so ultimately you&#x27;re getting more density, but largely because you&#x27;re decreasing the volume of the whole thing.Lithium is the limiting component, since it carries the charge - there&#x27;s a theoretical limit how little you can use and we&#x27;re within an order of magnitude of that. reply gpm 6 hours agorootparentI was curious about the value of the theoretical limit, googled it, and found this paper [1] with this chart [2].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S24058...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ars.els-cdn.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;image&#x2F;1-s2.0-S24058297193110... reply Epa095 13 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t think they might have though about \"Increased demand -> increased economies of scale over time\" when they made the original prediction? reply jfengel 13 hours agorootparentI guess it depends on who \"they\" were. An awful lot of the people making predictions didn&#x27;t want electric vehicles to succeed, and lowballed the degree of economies of scale.About the only one who seriously committed to it was Elon Musk and his engineers.

In other words normal business shit. reply wolfendin 12 hours agorootparentprev> Dealers say part of the problem is that a wealthier group of early EV adopters have already purchased a vehicle. Now, the industry is confronting a more reticent group of consumers, who are already being squeezed by high interest rates and rising costs.Seems like the cheaper batteries will solve that reply martinpw 13 hours agorootparentprevCan&#x27;t read the article but pretty sure demand is not decreasing, what is decreasing is the rate of growth. So still growing, but slower than before, which is a far different story. reply hiddencost 13 hours agorootparentprevThe cycles aren&#x27;t quite that tightly coupled, I think.The current battery tech is responding to demand (and demand predictions) from a couple years ago. reply dkjaudyeqooe 13 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a positive market move, because EV prices have been stupidly high and out of reach for most people in the market for a car.

GPTs suck. The OpenAI Assistants don&#x27;t have enough documentation to be used and therefore, equally suck.I really hope for the sake of the AI community (and economy) that [1] is the outcome. I really do not know how they could scale both. As an AI startup, I have a love-hate relationship with GPT and am eager to grow independent on them because how can I trust a company doing [2]? reply aidaman 1 hour agoprevGPT5 pre-training just ended I believe. Brock, Pachocki, Szymon Sidor, would have likely all been involved.These are huge losses. Pachocki led pre-training for GPT-4, and probably GPT-5. Brockman is the major engineer responsible for the efficiency improvements that enabled ChatGPT and GPT-4 to be even remotely cost-effective. That is a piece that is often overlooked, but OpenAI&#x27;s advantage over the competition in compute efficiency is probably even larger than the model itself. reply convexstrictly 1 hour agoparent\"Greg Brockman works 60 to 100 hours per week, and spends around 80% of the time coding. Former colleagues have described him as the hardest-working person at OpenAI.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;collection&#x2F;time100-ai&#x2F;6309033&#x2F;greg-brockman... reply sasaf5 1 hour agorootparentI am either skeptical or envious of such claims. Someone coding so much would quickly be launched into meetings to communicate one&#x27;s results and to coordinate with others.It would be my life&#x27;s dream to spend 80 hours per week coding without having to communicate with others... but no one is an island... reply nvarsj 44 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s possible, but harder than almost any other role. There are people at Google&#x2F;Meta like this. Usually E7&#x2F;E8 levels, \"coding machines\". It&#x27;s much easier to go into a pseudo PM&#x2F;TL&#x2F;Director role though to hit those levels and income, so it&#x27;s uncommon.You really have to have a passion for coding to put in the hours and be very good at it. Incredibly rare, believe it or not. Lots of people think they are good coders but this is another level. Proof is in your commit&#x2F;code review count&#x2F;async comms being 10x-100x of everyone else in your org, and it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re single-handedly enabling delivery of major projects earlier than anyone else could. Think of the pressure of doing this continuously. reply NhanH 22 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s not about being rockstar or 10x. He was the chairman of the board (and President of the LLC). Practically speaking, he can work however he wishes within the company. Seeing that he went from CTO role to President role, it&#x27;s fairly obvious that he got the opportunity to structure the role and the work to best fit him (and probably the company, too). reply potatopatch 25 minutes agorootparentprev> and it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re single-handedly enabling delivery of major projects earlier than anyone else could.You have to watch out with that.. I&#x27;ve seen whole projects pushed through by management where no one else was involved enough to review normally, but everyone had an interaction that implied they had only seen the top of the iceberg of problems with it. reply sasaf5 25 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe Google and Meta are different than my company, or maybe I am not in the league of such star coder, but in my experience as soon as a demo of my code is delivered I am immediately launched into managerial mode coordinating other devs working on my code. I came to just accept it. reply mindesc 18 minutes agorootparentprevIt could be also a sign of dependency hoarding and making you the bottleneck of the whole project. Bad architectural decisions, narcissistic need of importance or both. With those hours your partner starts to date with your friend. With experience I can assure you that position is not worth it. Not for you and not for the project. You end up draining your imagination.

They could offer excellent equity packages to all the best engineers and researchers and due to the non-profit nature of OpenAI (and hence no equity), these people might be very tempted to leave. reply rlt 3 minutes agorootparentOpenAI is supposedly “capped profit” so employees do get equity with limited upside.But yeah, since Sam and Greg were apparently pushed out because they were building too good of a business any OpenAI employees that were aligned with them are likely to jump ship and join them, and OpenAI will revert to the non-profit research lab it started out as. reply atleastoptimal 1 hour agorootparentprevWould they even be able to compete with OpenAI at this point? Even without Greg and Sam they have Ilya, the models they&#x27;ve trained so far, institutional knowledge, datasets and billions from Microsoft.

If OpenAI loses everyone to Sam and he starts some new AI company, it probably won&#x27;t be capped-profit and just be a normal company. All of the organizational safeguards OpenAI had inked with Microsoft and protection against \"selling AGI\" once-developed are out-the-window if he just builds AGI at a new company.I&#x27;m not saying this will happen, but it seems to me like an incredibly silly move. reply Fluorescence 22 minutes agoparentWhy not blame Altman for that?If he didn&#x27;t manage to keep OpenAI consistent with it&#x27;s founding principles and all interests aligned then wouldn&#x27;t booting him be right? The name OpenAI had become a source of mockery. If Altman&#x2F;Brockman take employees for a commercial venture, it just seems to prove their insincerity about the OpenAI mission. reply Phenomenit 4 minutes agorootparentBecause making as much profit as possible is the only virtue worth pursuing if you believe most comments on Hn. We’re basically Ferengui. reply Lacerda69 24 minutes agoparentprevIf MS gets their hands on an AGI help us god, but no \"organizational safeguards\" will matter.Not that I think AGI is possible or desirable in the first place, but that&#x27;s a different discussion. reply antman 55 minutes agoprevSo what was he lying about that got the board so pissed? A story that fits is that they assumed&#x2F;knew that he had different goals and&#x2F;or was going to create a spinoff.If they waited for the GPT5 pretraining to finish and then they minimized the cost of the loss of Altman and the engineers.The whole secrecy, compartmentalization and urgency of their actions could only be explained by being against a wall. Otherwise if it was about ethics, future plans or whatever political it would happen at a slower pace.Hope they involved their investors beforehand but I don&#x27;t know if they had time, OpenAI probably still exists and evolves on other people&#x27;s money. But what else could they do? reply thinkingemote 28 minutes agoparentcurrent popular theory is that those fired&#x2F;left were taking OpenAI for profit, and the board stuck with their original goal of non profit. reply Lacerda69 22 minutes agorootparentyou mean current completely made up speculation by anon online? reply thinkingemote 21 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s one source. There are others about, but as I wrote it&#x27;s a \"theory\".edits: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38314420I imagine when the full story comes out all these theories and speculations will be ignored and we will literally forget ever being interested in them! reply convexstrictly 2 hours agoprevJakub Pachocki and Szymon Sidor have worked on mu-parametrization&#x2F;tensor programs and Dota 2.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;author&#x2F;J.-Pachocki&#x2F;2713380?s...As @eachro pointed out, Aleksander Madry is on leave from his MIT professorship.

Given that they have an API and it takes effort to build on that vs. something else. I am small fry but maybe other people are wondering the same? Can they give reassurances about their products going into the future? reply mebutnotme 1 hour agoparentI’d recommend trying to build out your systems to work across LLMs where you can. Create an interface layer and for now maybe use OpenAI and Vertex as a couple of options. Vertex is handy as while not always as good you may find it works well for some tasks and it can be a lot cheaper for those.If you build out this way then when the next greatest LLM comes out you can plug that into your interface and switch the tasks it’s best at over. reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentThe problem is swapping LLMs can require rework of all your prompts, and you may be relying on specific features of OpenAI. If you don&#x27;t then you are at a disadvantage or at least slowing down your work. reply disconnection 1 hour agorootparentI have a hierarchy of templates, where I can automatically swap out parts of the prompt based on which LLM I am using. And also have a set of benchmarking tests to compare relative performance. I treat LLMs like a commodity and keep switching between them to compare performance. reply bongobingo1 1 hour agorootparentprevJust ask the LLM to rewrite your prompts for the new model. reply worldsayshi 1 hour agorootparentDoes it really have that kind of self awareness to be able to do that successfully? I feel very sceptical. reply Roark66 43 minutes agorootparentI doubt self awareness has anything to do with it.. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentprevDefinitely, just like with games development, the key is to master how things work, not specific APIs.AI tools will need a similar plugin like approach. reply siva7 2 hours agoparentprevI am wondering the same. It’s a PR desaster to their dev community and i’m not even sure if Sutskever isn’t secretly happy about this. reply karmasimida 1 hour agorootparentI am at lost. Not fear, just lost.Don&#x27;t know what to do. Is my investment into their API still worth it? It feels very unstable at this moment. reply padolsey 1 hour agorootparentIf you&#x27;re just using their completions&#x2F;chat API, you&#x27;re gonna be ok. As an ultimate fallback you can spin up H100s in the cloud and run VLLM atop a high param open model like Llama 70B. Such models will catch up and their param counts will increase.. eventually. But initially expect gpt-3.5-esque performance. VLLM will give you an OpenAI-like REST API atop a range of models. Keep making things :)) reply karmasimida 1 hour agorootparentThx. I will. My current interests mainly lies in benchmarking their vision model.That being said, I might not go further relying on their APIs for something more serious reply abm53 28 minutes agorootparentprevIf you are building something that is end-user facing that relies on ChatGPT then that was always a huge and risky bet on the future of OpenAI.In addition, it would likely be some time, possibly years, before it would be ready for production.Perhaps recent events have just brought that more clearly into focus for you. reply croes 33 minutes agorootparentprevBy that logic you could never use a third party API. reply ThrowawayTestr 1 hour agorootparentprevMicrosoft owns it. I honestly can not imagine trying to build a business on an API owned by Microsoft of all companies. reply dewey 1 hour agorootparentWhat makes you say that?Microsoft seems like one of the more reliable partners to build on compared to Google etc. just for the simple reason that their customers are large businesses and not breaking things for them is in their blood. Just like Windows backwards compatibility. reply ahepp 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t Microsoft famous for their insane API stability and backwards compatibility? reply karmasimida 1 hour agorootparentprevWould like to elaborate a bit?Though my investment will be still tiny at the moment, but not other multi-modal model on the market right is as good. reply reissbaker 1 hour agorootparentI actually wouldn&#x27;t be worried in the short term for exactly this reason. Microsoft has legal access to GPT-4 and is allowed to host and serve it via Azure. If OpenAI somehow tanks its API in the near term, MS is sitting on a gold mine and will make use of that by continuing to serve it. In the long term I am worried, but less worried if Sam and Greg form a competing co to continue to build. reply jeswin 1 hour agorootparentprevPeople have been successfully building on MS APIs for at least four decades now. I&#x27;ve been for nearly three.What exactly are you saying? reply croes 34 minutes agoparentprev>Can they give reassurances about their products going into the futureThey wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do that even before San&#x27;s dismissal reply robbomacrae 1 hour agoparentprevI&#x27;m in this boat. Not for my startup but for side projects I was absolutely pinning my hopes on them unlocking access to tools and relaxing some of their restrictions in the near future.. a future which now seem unlikely. reply cryptoz 1 hour agoparentprevAlso same here. Actually currently staying up late Friday night hacking on OpenAI API projects (while waiting for SpaceX Starship launch, it&#x27;s quite a day for high-tech news!) - and wondering if I should even bother. Of course I will keep hacking, but...still it makes you think. Which is a very unexpected feeling.Hugely more interested in the open source models now, even if they are not as good at present. Because at least there is a near-100% guarantee that they will continue to have community support no matter what; the missing problem I suppose is GPUs to run them. reply quickthrower2 1 hour agorootparentTotally. I&#x27;ll keep going too. I am just putting a nice GUI wrapper around the new Assistant stuff which looks damn cool.

It&#x27;s mainly a mainstream media propaganda machine where the propaganda is tech-related. Most commenters here know precisely jack and shit about technology.You are, unfortunately, correct. OpenAI has been a flaming toxic dumpster fire in the AGI safety alleyway. reply konschubert 4 minutes agorootparentConsider the possibility that people who know a thing or two technology might still think AI brings a lot of good and that kneecapping AI isn&#x27;t the right move at this time. reply convexstrictly 2 hours agoprevIn March, Sam Altman said that Pachocki&#x27;s \"overall leadership and technical vision\" was essential for pre-training GPT-4.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;sama&#x2F;status&#x2F;1635700851619819520 reply aidaman 1 hour agoparentHe also brought Pachocki to capitol hill soon after. reply riverdweller 35 minutes agoprevIf the speculation that the board want to open up everything so that it is truly open&#x2F;public domain \"for the benefit of humanity\" turns out to be accurate, I can&#x27;t see Microsoft being terribly happy about this now that they own 49% of OpenAI and want not only to recoup their investments but make ongoing profit.An exodus of staff might provoke a very quick release of a lot of code, pipelines, and training data by the remaining board before investors&#x27; lawyers have a chance to stop it. reply kozikow 4 minutes agoprevI know Jakub Pachocki and in my feeling, Jakub leaving is worse for gpt than Greg or Sam.Im not claiming to know more than everyone else, but Sam was IMO just a face.

It&#x27;s a very confusing departure, since most of the reporting so far indicates that Ilya and the board fired Sam to prioritize safety and non-profit objectives. A huge loss for OpenAI nonetheless. reply MattRix 2 hours agoparentPerhaps you could argue that he wants to stick with Sam and the others because if they start a company that competes with OpenAI, there’s a real chance they catch up and surpass OpenAI. If you really want to be a voice for safety, it’ll be most effective if you’re on the winning team. reply thekoma 1 hour agorootparentOne funny detail is that the OpenAI charter states that, if this happens, they will stop their own work and help the organisation that is closest to achieving OpenAI&#x27;s stated goal. reply trallnag 1 minute agorootparentMaybe Sam wants to build something for profit? reply aryamaan 18 minutes agorootparentprevreally? reply Closi 1 hour agorootparentprevDepends how much research is driven by Ilya… reply I_am_uncreative 1 hour agorootparentprevI dunno, the moat Sam tried to build might make it hard to make a competitor. reply jatins 1 hour agorootparentWe are about to find out if the moats are indeed that strong.xAI recently showed that training a decent-ish model is now a multi-month effort. Granted GPT-4 is still farther along than others but curious how many months&#x2F;resources does that add up when you have the team that built it in the first placeBut also, starting another LLM company might be too obvious a thing to do.

It&#x27;s a shame honestly, it was so exciting to see a company finally free itself of the shackles of navel gazing and just build things, but it seems like that&#x27;s over today. reply karmasimida 1 hour agorootparentYou misunderstood my point.The narrative I am referring to is a simple one: take back what should be his. A.k.a, revenge. That is for sure a strong word.People live on stories (collective imagination, if fancier), and what they like most is a wronged prince&#x2F;princess took back his&#x2F;her crown. It is the same with Taylor Swift rerecording her albums. The story potential will feed itself, until it is fully realized. The OpenAI board had committed a historical misstep, but maybe it is indeed what it is designed for: they hold no stakes in the business, so their view can&#x27;t be held accountable in a business microscope.

It replaces stackoverflow and quora, not Google. For shopping, I need to see the top X raw results, with reviews, so I can come to my own conclusion.

That&#x27;s really hard to do so let&#x27;s narrow it down to \"does not hallucinate\" the way GPT does, or more high level has a subjective understanding of its own that another agent can reliably come to trust. I can tell you that AI&#x2F;deep learning&#x2F;LLM hallucination is a technically unsolvable problem, so it&#x27;ll never get \"smarter\" in that way.2) This connects to number 2. Humans and animals of course aren&#x27;t infinitely \"smart;\" we fuck up and hallucinate in ways of our own, but that&#x27;s just it, we have a grounded truth of our own, born of a body and emotional experience that grounds our rational experience, or the consciousness you talk about.So my claim is really one claim, that AI cannot perform the same tasks or \"true\" intelligence level of a human in the sense of not hallucinating like GPT without having a subjective experience of its own.There is no answer or understanding \"out there;\" it&#x27;s all what we experience and come to understand.This is my favorite topic.

But AI is in a different dimension. I have been working in the domain for 30 years and I really didn&#x27;t think we would reach this level in my life time. Talking to a computer to bring it to make some quite complicated task is INCREDIBLE... However, since communication is really ubiquitous for Humans, we tend to forget that it is an incredible achievement...

    "title": "Manifest V3: Google's Deceptive Changes Threaten Chrome Users' Privacy",
    "originLink": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening",
    "originBody": "Manifest V3, Google Chrome’s soon-to-be definitive basket of changes to the world of web browser extensions, has been framed by its authors as “a step in the direction of privacy, security, and performance.” But we think these changes are a raw deal for users. We’ve said that since Manifest V3 was announced, and continue to say so as its implementation is now imminent. Like FLoC and Privacy Sandbox before it, Manifest V3 is another example of the inherent conflict of interest that comes from Google controlling both the dominant web browser and one of the largest internet advertising networks. Manifest V3, or Mv3 for short, is outright harmful to privacy efforts. It will restrict the capabilities of web extensions—especially those that are designed to monitor, modify, and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the websites you visit. Under the new specifications, extensions like these– like some privacy-protective tracker blockers– will have greatly reduced capabilities. Google’s efforts to limit that access is concerning, especially considering that Google has trackers installed on 75% of the top one million websites. It’s also doubtful Mv3 will do much for security. Firefox maintains the largest extension market that’s not based on Chrome, and the company has said it will adopt Mv3 in the interest of cross-browser compatibility. Yet, at the 2020 AdBlocker Dev Summit, Firefox’s Add-On Operations Manager said about the extensions security review process: “For malicious add-ons, we feel that for Firefox it has been at a manageable level....since the add-ons are mostly interested in grabbing bad data, they can still do that with the current webRequest API that is not blocking.” In plain English, this means that when a malicious extension sneaks through the security review process, it is usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit. The malicious activity happens elsewhere, after the data has already been read. A more thorough review process could improve security, but Chrome hasn’t said they’ll do that. Instead, their solution is to restrict capabilities for all extensions. As for Chrome’s other justification for Mv3– performance– a 2020 study by researchers at Princeton and the University of Chicago revealed that privacy extensions, the very ones that will be hindered by Mv3, actually improve browser performance. The development specifications of web browser extensions may seem in the weeds, but the broader implications should matter to all internet citizens: it’s another step towards Google defining how we get to live online. Considering that Google has been the world’s largest advertising company for years now, these new limitations are paternalistic and downright creepy. But don’t just take our words for it. Here are some thoughts from technologists, privacy advocates, and extension developers who share our concern over Manifest V3: \"A web browser is supposed to act on behalf of the user and respect the user's interests. Unfortunately, Chrome now has a track record as a Google agent, not a user agent. It is the only major web browser that lacks meaningful privacy protections by default, shoves users toward linking activity with a Google Account, and implements invasive new advertising capabilities. Google's latest changes will break Chrome privacy extensions, despite academic research demonstrating that no change is necessary. These user-hostile decisions are all directly attributable to Google's surveillance business model and enabled by its dominance of the desktop browser market.\" Jonathan Mayer, Princeton University “Manifest V3 positions Chrome as the all-powerful arbiter of what software lives and what dies, shattering the ideal of a diverse array of extensions serving the legitimate preferences and values of equally diverse users. In 2017, when Google banned AdNauseam from the Chrome store, it summarily cut off tens of thousands of users from data they had accumulated, and deprived them of a free and open-source extension to counter online profiling and manipulation. In hindsight, AdNauseam was the canary in the coal mine, as Mv3 is now poised to cut off users from a range of invaluable privacy tools (including ad blockers) that thousands if not millions rely on. A browser that plays favorites to advance its owners’ interests effectively chokes out innovative, independent developers, while shrinking the options for individuals to shape their online experiences.” Helen Nissenbaum and Daniel Howe (creators of AdNauseam and TrackMeNot) “Manifest V3 is a detrimental step back for internet privacy.” Ghostery company blog “Manifest V3 is an opinionated specification; it enforces limitations to improve user experience. That looks good on paper, but the reality is quite different. We at Ghostery believe that Google's Manifest V3 harms privacy protecting extensions. Instead of requiring service workers and removing blocking webRequest, Google should make service workers and declarativeNetRequest optional, providing solutions fit for different use cases. Ultimately, this is about user choice and innovation. Instead of having to reinvent the wheel, we at Ghostery would like to focus on finding new ways to prevent tracking. This is after all what browser extensions are and should be, a playing field for innovation and the express lane for browser enhancement.” Krzysztof Modras, director of engineering and product at Ghostery “Nearly all browser extensions as you know them today will be affected in some way: the more lucky ones will ‘only’ experience problems, some will get crippled, and some will literally cease to exist.” Andrey Meshkov, AdGuard company blog “Of all the browser extension API revolutions I've seen in 16 years of NoScript development, Manifest V3 is the worst offender by a long shot: a huge step backwards, and a poorly justified one. Manifest V3 shrinks extension capabilities and Web users' freedom to customize their browsing experience. While there are many reasons to doubt the claimed privacy improvements and the theoretical performance gains, the disruption for existing extensions is painfully real: non-trivial extensions will need to be rewritten, in cases forced to abandon fundamental features. But even worse is the severe crunch on browser extensions developers' ability to innovate, and, in the case of privacy and security extensions, to respond to emerging threats promptly and creatively. The net loss is huge, for developers but most importantly for web users' online safety and freedom of choice.” Giorgio Maone, author of NoScript “For SingleFile, I consider the migration to Manifest V3 to be a major regression from a functional and technical point of view. It also undermines some of the work done. Unfortunately, it doesn't bring any gains in return for the users. It is the very example of the collateral damage the Manifest V3 can cause.” Gildas, author of SingleFile More Information Google’s Manifest V3 Still Hurts Privacy, Security, and Innovation Manifest V3: Open Web Politics in Sheep's Clothing Google’s Plans for Chrome Extensions Won’t Really Help Security",

It will restrict the capabilities of web extensions—especially those that are designed to monitor, modify, and compute alongside the conversation your browser has with the websites you visit.Yes. Exactly! That&#x27;s the point - it restricts the ability for extensions to monitor, snoop, and steal content from every website you browse. reply danShumway 17 hours agoparent> but the changes basically align with Apple&#x27;s browser&#x2F;content APIs that they introduced in like 2016This, but Apple&#x27;s changes are just as bad and should be used as evidence of how this kind of restriction can go wrong, not how it can go right.Adblocking capabilities on Safari are unarguably weaker than they are on Chrome and Firefox. People will occasionally get upset at me when I say this, but it&#x27;s really not debatable, there is a reason why uBlock Origin is not on Safari. There is a reason why the best adblocking apps for Safari run as desktop applications and then communicate with an extension.Safari has a ton of other great privacy features, but adblocking is not one of them. So when we talk about how Manifest V3 is going to harm adblockers, we have good reason to make that claim -- we can look at Safari and see how it played out when Safari did the same thing.> That&#x27;s the point - it restricts the ability for extensions to monitor, snoop, and steal content from every website you browse.Most of the changes in Manifest V3 are actually pretty good, especially changes around the permission models. Active click is great, the optional permissions improvements are good.I understand why people are phrasing this as \"Manifest V3\" because you need a name for it, but I hope it&#x27;s not lost in this conversation that Firefox is also moving forward with its own implementation of Manifest V3 and it has the vast majority of the privacy improvements and almost none of the downsides.Getting rid of blocking request handlers doesn&#x27;t really improve privacy. Active tab permissions and optional runtime permissions improve privacy. When people talk about Manifest V3 being bad, what they usually mean is the extra restrictions Google has imposed on top of the privacy stuff; restrictions that do very little if anything to improve privacy (seriously, it is still trivial to spy on users using Chrome&#x27;s Manifest V3 across all sites) but that cripple adblockers.It&#x27;s possible to get the privacy improvements without the downsides. reply dwaite 16 hours agorootparent> There is a reason why the best adblocking apps for Safari run as desktop applications and then communicate with an extension.This is the only supported model for web extensions under Safari. There are no pure JavaScript distributions, they must be in an app. reply danShumway 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not just talking about distribution (although you are correct to bring up that restriction, because it&#x27;s also a kind of wild idea for extension security) -- I&#x27;m talking about just how much logic is fully moved outside of Safari.Adguard was (I haven&#x27;t checked in a while, maybe it still is) one of the more popular Safari content blockers for Mac, and it shipped with an Electron app -- and one that had to actually be running with a tray icon and everything at the same time as the browser.This is not a model that any other browser maker should be trying to copy. I feel like if we&#x27;re looking at browser adblockers and they&#x27;re setting up system trays and system-level proxies just so they can do basic stuff like HTML rewriting, then that&#x27;s not something the browser maker should be proud of. Congrats, people can&#x27;t spy on your browser&#x27;s web-traffic anymore, instead they have to MITM their entire computer.It&#x27;s possible to make something so restrictive that the end result is that people are actually less secure, because they&#x27;re forced to compromise security at much lower levels in order to get that basic functionality back. Safari&#x27;s current extension ecosystem is a great example of that. reply AlexandrB 20 hours agoparentprev> Yes. Exactly! That&#x27;s the point - it restricts the ability for extensions to monitor, snoop, and steal content from every website you browse.Does it though? The webRequest API still exists in MV3, but as read-only. So if you&#x27;re interested in snooping everything you still can.> That’s because Manifest V3 doesn’t change the observational APIs available to extensions. (For extension developers, that means Manifest V3 isn’t changing the observational parts of chrome.webRequest.) In other words, Manifest V3 will still allow extensions to observe the same data as before, including what URLs users visit and the contents of pages users visit.[1][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2019&#x2F;07&#x2F;googles-plans-chrome-e... reply lima 18 hours agorootparentWith Manifest v3, you can get adblocking without having to trust your adblocker extension, like on Safari. That&#x27;s a significant benefit.You can still opt into having your data stolen, but now it&#x27;s no longer a requirement for adblocking. reply danShumway 17 hours agorootparentOr, you could use Firefox and you could have both APIs available to you and you could choose whether you wanted strong adblocking or fewer extension permissions.Manifest V3 doesn&#x27;t get rid of the permissions that allow an extension to spy on you.Yes, you can choose not to install extensions that use those permissions (although the current webextension permissions system is chock-full of holes and Manifest V3 still has many of those holes). But you can already make that choice. You can go to Firefox and install Ublock Origin Lite right now today if you want to make that choice: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;ublock-origin...It&#x27;s available on both Chrome and Firefox and you can install it and only grant it the blocking permission and nothing else.Removing the blocking web request API in Manifest V3 does nothing to improve security. It doesn&#x27;t offer you new choices, it just removes your choice to use a more powerful adblocker if you need one. reply dwaite 16 hours agorootparent> Manifest V3 doesn&#x27;t get rid of the permissions that allow an extension to spy on you.Yes, but extensions have to go through review to be in supported channels, and review will absolutely look at over-entitlement of submitted extensions. reply danShumway 15 hours agorootparent> Yes, but extensions have to go through review to be in supported channels, and review will absolutely look at over-entitlement of submitted extensions.Okay, then Google can use that same review process for apps that request access to the blocking API. If you&#x27;ve decided to trust the review process to ferret out unneeded permissions, then copying Firefox&#x27;s model and having a `blocking` permission should be fine.Either way, removing blocking webRequests isn&#x27;t improving anyone&#x27;s privacy. The same review process is required that would have been required before, and the same kind of spying is possible when that review process fails. reply sunshowers 16 hours agorootparentprevI trust gorhill a lot more than I trust Apple or Google! reply babypuncher 17 hours agorootparentprevExcept then, like safari, the size of your blocklist is limited by what the browser allows. Manifest V3 versions of extensions like uBlock Origin will be less effective at blocking ads and trackers. reply ahartmetz 20 hours agoparentprevWhat if you trust your extensions more than the websites you visit? You will have a few extensions and hundreds or thousands of websites. reply pvg 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s very difficult for users to make these decisions in an informed way, for either websites or extensions. The browser highly distrusts websites by default and doesn&#x27;t give users many options to change that. Plus most people have some notion of how trustworthy &#x27;the internet&#x27; is and act accordingly.This isn&#x27;t the case for extensions and I think it&#x27;s become clear over the years it can&#x27;t be fixed with various trust knobs so they&#x27;re left with fiddling with the capabilities&#x2F;trying to fix the overly permissive design. reply ragnese 13 hours agorootparentThe call is coming from inside the house, though. The problem here is largely one of perverse incentives. The fact that Microsoft and Google both offer web browsers AND benefit from spying on people USING web browsers means that I automatically distrust 100% of whatever they&#x27;re trying to do with browsers and&#x2F;or web standards.I feel like the real solution here is simply to pop up a big scary warning whenever you try to install an extension that says: \"Hey, this extension will be able to read and&#x2F;or modify your internet traffic. It could steal your bank account information. Are you really sure you trust the developer of this thing that much?\".Or, you could make two tiers of extensions, where one tier is the \"harmless\" tier that can&#x27;t actually do anything with requests and responses or modify the DOM, and the other is the \"advanced\" tier that displays the big scary warning above.But, honestly, that should be about it. There are a few things we need to remember for some context, IMO:* 99% (made up number) of web users don&#x27;t install extensions, anyway. This is more true the less savvy the person is. * A web browser isn&#x27;t going to stop the user from downloading virus.exe or from installing SpyBrowserMaxx.app on their computers, so how much effort is really reasonable to try to prevent users from installing bad extensions? * Hindering good extensions, like uBlockOrigin, actively HARMS the privacy and security of browser users.Let&#x27;s not be tricked into giving up our own ability to fight against tracking and spying for the mythical Grandma who installs browser extensions from sketchy side-channels (is that even possible anymore in either Chrome or Firefox?). reply duped 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is extremely patronizing to users. reply kaibee 17 hours agorootparent&#x27;users&#x27; is an extremely broad category. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a one size fits all solution. There&#x27;s probably some hundred million users who can, on average, make good decisions about extensions. There&#x27;s also hundreds of millions of users who are children or are otherwise unable to make good decisions about extensions. Google, corporations in general, will force a 1 size fits all solution even when it doesn&#x27;t, because it is cheaper&#x2F;more profitable. reply dwaite 15 hours agorootparentprevIt is not a user’s expectation of responsibility - they aren’t going to track that an extension’s automatic update turned it from a coupon clipper to a surveillance engine. If we make this the user’s responsibility, there would be immense harm. reply hyperdimension 13 hours agorootparentMaybe then auto-updating is the problem here. Why can&#x27;t users have the agency to decide if they want to update or not? I know Microsoft&#x2F;Google for one spearheaded the whole It&#x27;s For Your Own Good movement, but opting out should at least be an option... reply madeofpalk 17 hours agorootparentprevHow am I supposed to understand whether extensions are stealing my data?I&#x27;ve made browser extensions and I find it difficult to make an informed decision! reply gustavus 17 hours agorootparentprevThe old \"but think of the old people argument\" used to remove our ownership of our devices and freedom to do what we want.Either it is my device that I own and I can make decisions for or it isn&#x27;t, and if it doesn&#x27;t belong to me then who does it belong to? reply dwaite 15 hours agorootparentInter-networked connectivity made this style ownership model untenable though since the 90s - the amount of harm an application can do now that it can receive remote instructions and siphon off data has increased.Hence software publication tied to real-world identity, sandboxing to reduce access to local sensitive data, entitlements to enumerate needs for local capabilities and a review process both to restrict unnecessary entitlements and put additional non-technically-enforceable restrictions on software.Maybe if GDPR-like regulations were not laxly enforced or non-existent, the platforms would need to do less policing themselves. reply soraminazuki 17 hours agorootparentprevEven more, what if you trust uBO more than Google Chrome? reply NOWHERE_ 17 hours agorootparentI do, that’s why I use firefox. reply wvenable 16 hours agoparentprevBrowsers are massive privacy and security holes that users opt themselves into.

So I can turn that off if I&#x27;m confident about a particular extension, right?No? OK so it&#x27;s just another land grab taking more from users and giving it to Google.

Me neither.Again, same market pressure, a useful actually used feature will never be removed because people will not buy the device.Most people don&#x27;t care about replaceable batteries, headphone jacks or rooting.In fact not allowing rooting is net benefit for the vast majority because it prevents spyware being installed on the device by a controlling partner, ... reply ragnese 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not truly how it works except in some very narrow, literal, sense.The reality is that people in the developed world need to carry smart phones. It&#x27;s expected in order to be a functioning member of society. My kid&#x27;s school has an app that does messaging and notifications, my kid&#x27;s after-school group has a different app that does likewise, etc. A few weeks ago, I was expected to \"sign\" a waiver for an activity by clicking a link in an email... while I was AT THE PLACE IN QUESTION. Since I didn&#x27;t happen to bring a laptop to this activity, I pulled out my smart phone to do it.So, when my phone breaks, I have no choice but to buy another one. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a new model, of course. But, if they all collectively move toward removing features that I&#x27;d prefer to have (like removable batteries) or start adding things that I DON&#x27;T want, I&#x27;m still going to buy it because I more-or-less have to.So, it&#x27;s not that people don&#x27;t care or actually prefer the way things are going. It&#x27;s that they feel like they have no choice.Again, I understand that they&#x2F;we LITERALLY have a choice. We&#x27;re not going to die if we don&#x27;t buy a smart phone. But, it&#x27;s not as simple as \"they bought the thing, so they must approve of all of it.\" reply hurryer 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s about what the majority wants - thinner waterproof phones instead of a removable battery.You are not forced by the evil companies, you are forced by market pressure from the majority of consumers.Not even Apple was able to resist consumer pressure, they famously yielded and made a big screen phone. reply ragnese 9 hours agorootparent> You are not forced by the evil companies, you are forced by market pressure from the majority of consumers.It can be both.If Apple decided to do something moderately annoying to their phones without considering any user&#x2F;customer feedback, it wouldn&#x27;t drastically affect sales.There&#x27;s a limit, of course. If they&#x27;re too hostile, too quickly, then people will buy Android phones instead. But, if it&#x27;s just a little bit worse for the end user, customers will keep buying iPhones.Why? Because of vendor lock-in. Why do you think companies have been trying to lock us in to their product ecosystems since the dawn of market economics? It&#x27;s certainly not to make it EASIER for their customers to \"vote with their wallets.\"For example, I&#x27;d be willing to bet good money that Microsoft didn&#x27;t start putting ads and shit into Windows 10 or whatever because it really thought that Windows users would just LOVE that. I also bet they didn&#x27;t decide to re-enable settings during updates that users disabled because the majority of Windows users wanted to have to periodically reapply settings changes that they made...> Not even Apple was able to resist consumer pressure, they famously yielded and made a big screen phone.I don&#x27;t know the internals of what goes on at Apple, but both the small size and the \"no-stylus\" convictions seemed to be due to Steve Jobs. And I&#x27;ll note that both, the bigger size phones and the iPad stylus came out at least a couple years after he died. So, it&#x27;s not obvious to me that Apple would have yielded on those with Jobs at the helm. reply saurik 14 hours agorootparentprevOk, but this mentality means you are buying into a narrative of a platform which is locked down not directly for your benefit or when it matters to you, but instead as an indirect side effect of building a platform catered to developers of apps like the banking app who then have complete control to make the call on when this matters and what they consider to be invalid... and so I just need to make sure that you understand, in the context of this thread on ad blocking, that by expressing this opinion, you are also, in practice, saying you think people blocking ads shouldn&#x27;t be allowed (whether the mechanism is that developers move content from the web into apps you must install or the web fully supports the same level of drm as the app platform). reply hurryer 14 hours agorootparentNo, that&#x27;s not my position.My position is freedom. To create locked-down devices. Or open ones. And freedom for consumers to buy which kind they want. You are taking a position that you know what&#x27;s best for consumers. That&#x27;s quite presumptuous.For most consumers a locked device is in their interest because it protects them from malware and data loss. reply grotorea 14 hours agorootparentprevFor curiosity&#x27;s sake, what app was it?

They fixed bugs, filled in functionality gaps (examples: userScripts API, the Offscreen API cludge), and made a number of improvements to DNR, their limited-by-design replacement for the powerful and flexible webRequest API. Google also relaxed their initial, entirely unreasonable service worker lifetime requirements.So where are we now with service workers and DNR?The requirement to base extensions on service workers adds complexity and headaches to developers, but because of various policy changes and workarounds, it is no longer the issue it was two years ago. Google put in a lot of effort to make service workers kind of work for extensions. I think the end result is it&#x27;s now harder to make a browser extension, but service workers are no longer a deal breaker.However, blocking webRequest is still mostly gone, unavailable outside of a specific proxy authentication use case, and DNR is still not an acceptable replacement.There are still outstanding functionality gaps such as https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;w3c&#x2F;webextensions&#x2F;issues&#x2F;302, which is interesting in that much of the tracking that privacy extensions are no longer able to properly handle is by Google!But more importantly, DNR is fundamentally not an adequate replacement for webRequest.As we wrote in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2021&#x2F;12&#x2F;googles-manifest-v3-st...> [R]emoving blocking webRequest won’t stop abusive extensions, but will harm privacy and security extensions. If Manifest V3 is merely a step on the way towards a more \"safe\" (i.e., limited) extensions experience, what will Manifest V4 look like? If the answer is fewer, less-powerful APIs in service of “safety”, users will ultimately suffer. The universe of possible extensions will be limited to what Google explicitly chooses to allow, and creative developers will find they lack the tools to innovate. Meanwhile, extensions that defend user privacy and safety against various threats on the Web will be stuck in the past, unable to adapt as the threats evolve.The gist is that we now all depend on Google to keep evolving the API to keep up with advertisers and trackers. Google is a massive advertising company. Chrome extensions already had one \"lost decade\", where nothing much happened until the Manifest V3 proposal.It&#x27;s just not a good idea to let Google hold the keys to anti-tracking tech. reply stareatgoats 22 hours agoprev(2021)EFF had a slew of articles about the evils of MV3 2019 - 2021.

I believe Chrome won because 1) Firefox had long been struggling with RAM consumption and stability 2) Chrome&#x27;s onboarding was closer to effortless 3) It was relentlessly marketed&#x2F;placed to saturation.Chrome had it&#x27;s own RAM issues but #3 outweighed that. Any lock-in Chrome now has is due to A) #3, B) a better sync process that&#x27;s integrated with Gmail and C) better corporate deployment (Gmail+Chrome).I&#x27;ve had my corp customers on Chrome over Firefox by about 4 to 1. I&#x27;m not happy about that but I have to prioritize their experience.However, Firefox has drastically improved in stability (as has Chrome). Chrome is getting less friendly. Where syncing isn&#x27;t used, I see paths to swap users over the next year or so. reply zztop44 19 hours agorootparentI agree that Chrome’s lock-in now is around syncing&#x2F;integration. And, of course, the marketing.Firefox is now totally competitive on speed&#x2F;stability. But it’s not a significantly better browsing experience, which is what it would need to be in order to overcome inertia and get people to switch.PS: My memory is that Firefox’s RAM issues were pretty awful when Chrome launched (if you had many tabs open it was only a matter of time until the browser crashed).

So a large part of this effort actually DID go into MV2.There&#x27;s a better question: what if instead of investing huge amount of times into DNR they put it somewhere else? For instance, into providing better tools for extensions to persist their state so that we didn&#x27;t have to rewrite the extensions from scratch to make them work with the new service workers model? I think it would&#x27;ve been much much much better.

They&#x27;re not persistent too.2. They have a different purpose, they&#x27;re supposed to be used as a temporary crutch that gives access to DOM features for the time until it&#x27;s brought to service workers.> persistent service workersYou&#x27;re right to write it in cursive, there&#x27;re ways to prolong the lifetime of a service worker, but they&#x27;re not persistent anyways. All in all, the only reliable way to live with service worker is to rewrite extensions in a way that allows them to very quickly initialize after the service worker is brought back to life. For some extensions it&#x27;s easy, for some it&#x27;s quite a complicated task.edit: formatting reply davidmurdoch 16 hours agorootparentI have it on good authority (Chrome Devrel) that the method described here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.chrome.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;extensions&#x2F;migrating&#x2F;to-se... is no longer limited to only managed devices for enterprise or education. reply ameshkov 11 hours agorootparentHere’s what I heard: they are okay with such a workaround for now because they realize how hard it is to adapt to the new model, but in the future they’d prefer to see extensions adapt and be able to quickly reinit. replyTimshel 21 hours agoparentprevWas wondering the exact date of the quote used by Google but could not find it.Looking at Adguard recent publication https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adguard.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;afds-2023-recap.html it seems more in line than the one from 2021.

In fact, I&#x27;d found the opposite to be true: it&#x27;s gotten in the way.

This is a real threat - how do you protect users from their own actions?Putting aside the cynicism about Google&#x27;s \"true\" motives and assuming the best intentions on their part... this still seems like an overly broad limitation without a good workaround.Personally, I use as few extensions as possible, and I&#x27;m very particular about which ones. I&#x27;m sure most readers here are as well. So, for me (us?), this is a problem, especially if we also maintain extensions. But - what about my mom? She doesn&#x27;t even know how to remove extensions, never mind review them for potential problems. We should not sacrifice the many (and encourage the bad actors) to ensure that the few have the access they want.Why not put in settings that allow the user to allow extensions outside the bounds of MV3?

The whole app has to be statically defined. This makes it much easier to know what&#x27;s running, since an extension can no longer go pull in extra code, but it greatly reduces what you can do as an extension too.

Manifest V3 prevents some of the things I need to do for it to make network requests. The only solution is to deploy a central proxy that can make these requests and funnel all client requests through that proxy. Theoretically I could use that proxy to track my users. At the moment I do no tracking whatsoever. I&#x27;m sure its going to cause a bunch of users to uninstall no matter how much I promise I won&#x27;t track them.A very popular extension, Hoverzoom, does the same things I need to do so its author will need the same solution, or severely limit its functionality. ...and I doubt the author will be able to support a proxy service with the volume it would get. reply davidmurdoch 19 hours agoparentCan you use an iframe in an offscreen document? reply rickreynoldssf 19 hours agorootparentNope, I need to set&#x2F;change headers. reply Drakim 19 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t understand, V3 is very important to enhance user privacy.

I use the element zapper to block non-ad related things sometimes.For me, I&#x27;m torn on whether the extra security is worth this limitation or not, and so far I have went back to using the normal ublock, and I have went back to using firefox because chromium crashed fairly often when using the wayland renderer.There is some way you can grant ublock lite more permissions on specific sites, I&#x27;m not sure what this does, and I don&#x27;t think it brings back the element zapper, but it would be cool if it did. reply cwales95 22 hours agoprevThey&#x27;ll do anything to weaken user&#x27;s ability to ensure their privacy and block ads it seems. reply fooker 22 hours agoprevThis might be the final straw that motivates me to start deGoogling my online activities. reply mcpackieh 22 hours agoprevI am upset for the common users of Chrome.

WebRequestOne of the most controversial changes of Chrome’s MV3 approach is the removal of blocking WebRequest, which provides a level of power and flexibility that is critical to enabling advanced privacy and content blocking features. Unfortunately, that power has also been used to harm users in a variety of ways. Chrome’s solution in MV3 was to define a more narrowly scoped API (declarativeNetRequest) as a replacement. However, this will limit the capabilities of certain types of privacy extensions without adequate replacement.Mozilla will maintain support for blocking WebRequest in MV3. To maximize compatibility with other browsers, we will also ship support for declarativeNetRequest. We will continue to work with content blockers and other key consumers of this API to identify current and future alternatives where appropriate. Content blocking is one of the most important use cases for extensions, and we are committed to ensuring that Firefox users have access to the best privacy tools available.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;addons&#x2F;2022&#x2F;05&#x2F;18&#x2F;manifest-v3-in-fi... reply _Algernon_ 20 hours agorootparentJust like they promised to reimplement replacements for XUL extensions almost a decade ago.

I prefer PWAs to Electron variants: better sandboxing, use of browser extensions, often better memory use; see: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;howfuguismybrowser.dev&#x2F;– no customizable keyboard shortcuts and poor accessibility preventing OS-level solutions; in macOS I can set shortcuts for Chrome, for various Tab actions, like Pin Tab or Close Others.

These profiles are completely separated as well, have their own histories, bookmarks, cookie jars, extensions etc.FF&#x27;s Containers on the other hand are a less heavy-handed approach, by staying in the same profile, having the same bookmarks, extensions and history but fully separating the cookie jars, enabling you to have (just as an example) Facebook in its own little world, everything else outside that container and&#x2F;or in their own specific containers, unable to cross-contaminate (to track you) with third-party cookies and the like.Basically, profiles and containers are entirely different levels of sandboxing. reply bad_user 17 hours agorootparentThis is precisely what I&#x27;m ranting about.

Especially consistency.We moved, and it&#x27;s not feasible to run ethernet everywhere in our current home.

However, whoever built the home ran coax to nearly every room in the house - it&#x27;s a bit ridiculousHow old is the house? If its more than 20ish years old running coax everywhere was a great choice. That would be before CAT5e cable so if they had went with ethernet cable instead of coax you&#x27;d be looking at 100 Mb&#x2F;s. If it was built before 1995 you&#x27;d be looking at CAT4 and under 20 Mb&#x2F;s.I&#x27;ve got an ethernet cable running between the two rooms that are farthest apart in my house, but it is kind of ugly. I just screwed in cup hooks or nailed in nails at an angle on the walls up near the ceiling and draped the cable over them.The right way would be to run it through the crawlspace or attic. I don&#x27;t want to crawl around in the crawlspace, and my attic is the kind that if you aren&#x27;t very careful you can put a foot through the ceiling of the room below, and has a bunch of blown in insulation that would probably make it even harder to get around so I don&#x27;t want to try that.I&#x27;ve wondered if I could run cable through the attic without actually going into the attic. Open the top of a wall below and drill up into the attic. Attach the cable to a pole and use that to push it up into the attic several feet, with the end of the cable tied into a loop.Then send a drone into the attic, fly it to the pole, hook the loop, detach the cable from the pole, and fly the end of the cable over to the attic access hatch.Then do the same with a cable at the other end. Splice the two ends together.Is that reasonable feasible or is it just crazy? reply medstrom 3 minutes agorootparentMaybe you can have a friend stick his head into the attic at the destination, while you stick your head up at the origin, then you just tie the cable end to a basketball and throw it through the attic for your friend to catch. reply js2 17 hours agorootparentprev> That would be before CAT5e cable so if they had went with ethernet cable instead of coax you&#x27;d be looking at 100 Mb&#x2F;s.

The primary difference between FE and GE with respect to cabling is that GE uses all 4 pairs where FE used only 2 pairs. The difference between 5 and 5e cable is pretty negligible, and the GigE standard only requires Cat 5, not 5eWith respect to Cat 4, you&#x27;re confusing the signal bandwidth and data rate. Cat 4 supports up to 20 Mhz signal bandwidth. It can be utilized by either 10BASE-T (10 Mbit&#x2F;s) or 100BASE-T4 (100 Mbit&#x2F;s).If there&#x27;s twisted pair data cabling in the home at all, it&#x27;s probably suitable for GigE. Otherwise it&#x27;s likely RJ11 phone cabling that&#x27;s not typically going to be in a home run topology.That said, the standards are pretty forgiving over shorter distances.

I did this professionally for years.Wheeled or tracked R&#x2F;C cars are much easier to control, and can pull a greater force horizontally without losing control. In the 90s it was somewhat standard, especially in office environments with drop ceilings, to use a little 9.6v Tyco Fast Traxx to zip a pullstring across the ceiling grid, then use the string to pull the much heavier cables. (I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s in use today, but I put a LOT of miles on that Tyco.)Leave some slack at each end, sufficient to lift the cable up and place it in ceiling hangers \"later\", wink wink. Because leaving it flopped along the ceiling grid wasn&#x27;t professional, nudge nudge.Anyway, you don&#x27;t splice in the middle. Neeeeever do that. Hidden splices are madness-inducing.

I&#x27;m never going to get the time to actually try to make this, so if anyone wants to feel free.I&#x27;ve had small tasks I wanted done that would only take someone with the right skills and equipment a few minutes that I didn&#x27;t want to DIY either because I lack the skills or I&#x27;d need to buy some equipment I don&#x27;t have and would not get enough future use out of to justify the cost, but I also didn&#x27;t want to pay for the minimum of 30 minutes or 1 hour of labor that many contractors and companies charge.A good example is that there was a security light mounted on a pole on top of my garage. I wanted to remove the bulb, but it was screwed in tight enough that using one of those light bulb removers on a pole I could not get it to budge. I&#x27;m not agile enough to be willing to try to climb onto my garage roof.The idea is that I&#x27;d list this task on the app, with how much I&#x27;d pay (probably $20 cash) and my neighborhood. Then handymen, roofers, electricians, etc., could check the app or site when they are out on a job site and it would show them such tasks that are near them.So say some roofers are doing something for a neighbor. They could check the app, see that it&#x27;s a quick $20 cash for one of them on their way home or on their lunch break to come over and spend a minute or two doing my task.

Because this requires you to open up and patch the drywall at 1.5m height if you bring the cable from the attic. From the crawlspace the hardest part is to make sure you drill inside the wall, not through the floor! For that I found that somebody with a powerful magnet in the house while you carry metal washers with you under is helpful to locate precisely the walls.

All things considered, it looks pretty nice. However I wanted ethernet back here for obvious reasons, and for several other reasons relating to layout, using either of the basement-facing walls wouldn&#x27;t work.SO: I realized that to run the plumbing and such from the furnace and utility area to this corner, they left a cavity a few inches tall in the ceiling at the outside-facing wall to this little cabinet. I bought a piece of 10-foot PVC pipe an inch wide, and slid it into this cavity between the existing pipes, securing it in place with a little bracket and some junk screws. Then I shoved four ethernet cables through that, into this little closet, and installed an ethernet wall plate in the door since it isn&#x27;t regularly used and hooked it up there with enough slack that the door can move easily when we need to have any mechanicals serviced in there.It&#x27;s worked perfectly for the last 5 years.

At 10m, not so clear, especially since cabling that&#x27;s that old is also likely to be daisy chained, so you&#x27;re looking at maybe a daisy chain of switches running at 10m. That said, cabling is often better than the spec it was tested to, and ethernet cable requirements are for long runs in dense conduit; it&#x27;s worth trying 100M on old telephone wiring if it&#x27;s already in the wall to see what you can get. reply InvaderFizz 18 hours agorootparentWorth trying on a shorter run of CAT3, yes.

There&#x27;s a defined band plan, because historically cable TV was just transmitting radio signals over coaxial cable instead of radio, so it inherited the broadcast TV band plan. Then digital TV inherited the analogue cable band plan and added higher-frequency channels.To answer your question, cable TV uses frequencies between about 55MHz to 1GHz, but mostly starting at about 500MHz for digital cable. So if I wanted to transmit Ethernet over cable, I&#x27;d use a 2GHz band or something to avoid interference. reply retrac 13 hours agorootparent> historically cable TV was just transmitting radio signals over coaxial cable instead of radioWell, to be pedantic, that is still how it works. And it&#x27;s how cable Internet works. And it&#x27;s also how a lot of techniques over twisted pair work, too.The conductor is used as a waveguide and a very-much-analogue signal encoding a digital signal is what is sent over the line. DOCSIS 3 uses up to QAM-4096, which can encode 12 bits in a single symbol on the line, by using multiple steps of amplitude shift and phase shift, to encode bits. Quite similar to how FM radio works, just digital steps, rather than an analogue continuum between 0 and 100 amplitude and 0 and 100 phase, at the decoder.This has even started showing up for links within a single computer, now. The latest revision of PCIe uses modulated RF (4-level pulse amplitude modulation) rather than simple binary voltage levels. reply kube-system 17 hours agorootparentprevMoCa was designed specifically to work over existing coax used for TV and behave with existing signals.

You&#x27;re not streaming uncompressed video as that would require more than 2.5Gbps, and if you want to upgrade to 8k video, you&#x27;ll need a new TV anyway...I always wire in my TV and other fixed infrastructure because, since they aren&#x27;t moving, there&#x27;s no advantage to using a data layer protocol that, by definition, enables mobile access.

One of problems AFAIK - most switch default to dropping jumbo frames. You can enable but if you&#x27;ll left one unconfigured for some reason you will get hard to diagnose problem. The same with end hosts - they (inside a given L2 domain) should have the same MTU and if you&#x27;ll left a box with the default MTU you got a problem.To make jumbo frames easier to use switches should forward them by default and hosts should accept frames large than MTA (but send MTU sized ones). reply averageRoyalty 11 hours agorootparentJumbo frames are used constantly in practice, just not often on the internet.

Which costs money. More money than is lost by the higher cost of routing smaller packets.So, no, jumbo frames could not be a thing on the internet.

The actual term is frame. datagram is generally used to refer to layer 4 operation, and the term is not used anywhere in IEEE 802.3.Also the GP is correct to say we fossilized on 1500 byte packets, since the layer 3 MTU is the relevant thing when talking about fossilization in the internet at large. This number was driven by 802.3&#x27;s standard frame size being 1514 bytes, but that one is not even fossilized as much.

Have ISPs support 9000 byte frames and fragment to 1500 bytes for compatibility with the wider internet? Then something like PMTUD can be used to bypass this fragmentation when supported?To be clear, I would love to have larger MTU sizes. I just don&#x27;t see a straightforward way to transition everything over. I&#x27;m not a network engineer though, maybe there just isn&#x27;t enough a strong enough impetus for anyone to dedicate the resources to this. reply ForkMeOnTinder 9 hours agorootparentAlso not a network engineer. But I&#x27;d imagine first the Tier 1 ISPs (Level 3 etc) could enable jumbo frames and make sure they work smoothly amongst each other. After a few years of waiting, new consumer devices&#x2F;OSs can start trying to send jumbo frames, while setting the Don&#x27;t Fragment flag. If some router in the path doesn&#x27;t support 9000, it will signal back ICMP Fragmentation Needed, and the device can transparently resend with 1500. Then add some local caching to avoid the roundtrip for subsequent connections to the same noncompliant network&#x2F;endpoint.And since it&#x27;s a big change anyway, why stop at 9000? Why not 65000? Packets don&#x27;t have to fill the entire MTU after all. If 65000 is supported, you can choose to send 1500, 9000, or 65000 based on your desired latency&#x2F;throughput tradeoff. reply quickthrower2 14 hours agorootparentprevIPv6 has more pain (lack of IPv4 addresses) motivating it. reply uberduper 16 hours agorootparentprevpmtu reply hnlmorg 20 hours agorootparentprevIf you want to be picky then it’s actually Ethernet frame, which is neither a datagram nor a packet.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ethernet_frameAlso, while we are being picky, datagram is one word not two. reply cduzz 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure a switch is just an L2 bridge but still uses the ethernet address management mechanism (mac addresses) not the L3 IP (or whatever) address &#x2F; routing mechanisms.Modern ethernet, on wires anyhow, is very different from the original one with a shared broadcast domain.

I have bidirectional 1 GB plugged into a $200 EdgeSwitch, which then feeds Cat 6 throughout the home ($100&#x2F;500 feet). This then filters down to $20-30 unmanaged 1 GB switches elsewhere. The whole thing is under $500.If I wanted to go up to 10 GB I don&#x27;t just need to change to a $2K~ EdgeSwitch, I also need to run fiber&#x2F;6E to be able to deliver more than 2.5 GB to any endpoint, then invest in expensive switching infrastructure elsewhere in the home to turn the incoming 10 GB signal into something more devices can accept (e.g. 1 GB or 2.5 GB).Safe estimate, is to go from 1 GB bidirectional to 10 GB bidirectional, it would be $5K in equipment and pulling new cable.For $100&#x2F;month I can do 10 GB, but I won&#x27;t because of the equipment cost&#x2F;diminishing returns rather than the ISP cost difference.

It feels like for ages, it’s been the opposite - you buy hardware that is prepared for the future or at least the present. At least that’s how it’s been with SATA etc..For instance, the cheapest NIC is like $75 and the router can only do 10G on one port. Wifi6 does not get near those speeds either and even so laptops have to be very new (even my M1 does not have full support for the 802.11ax thingy - partner’s M2 was at least able to pull ~1.6 Gbit&#x2F;s).

The latest Call of Duty apparently is 200GB. On 1gbit you are limited to 125MB&#x2F;s downloads (assuming zero overhead) that&#x27;s almost a half an hour to download. PCIe4 SSD&#x27;s are capable of write speeds of about 7GB&#x2F;s and PCIe5 SSD&#x27;s are just hitting the market with even faster speeds. At 10Gbit you can download that game in less than 3 minutes. In neither case are you even approaching the speed at which your PC can store that data.When PCIe5 SSD&#x27;s go mainstream a home PC user would even be able to saturate a 100Gbit connection. reply stephenr 19 hours agorootparentPlease, I implore you, to read the line you quoted again, and then perhaps pull out the old Oxford English, and look up what \"very few\" means.I&#x27;ll be generous and give you a hint: it doesn&#x27;t mean none.But your example also has great relevance to the \"familiar\" sentence in my original comment which was:> 2.5G is rapidly approaching, if not already past the point, for a lot of people where a single machine will never use all of that capacity, and the advantage of higher total bandwidth is to support multiple people doing high bandwidth tasks.I italicised the part that I knew people would somehow ignore in my original comment and I&#x27;ve done it again, because obviously once wasn&#x27;t enough.Here, let me pull out the important words yet again just to make it really clear:> for a lot of people reply hnlmorg 19 hours agorootparentprevNot the commenter but I’ve heard people make statements like that time and time again, only for those limits to be obliterated a few years later.The thing is, the moment a new upper bound becomes available, developers find a way to use it. It’s like the freeway problem that adding more roads ironically adds to congestion.Take storage, the greater the storage capacity of media increased, the larger game assets became. The faster CPUs and system memory became, the heavier our operating systems and desktop software became.Likewise, the faster our internet becomes, the more dependent we will become on streaming high fidelity content. 4k on a lot of streaming services is compressed to hell and back to work with people on slower internet connections. And much as Google Stadia was shutdown, video game streaming services aren’t a failed experiment. Plus even with more traditional services, how many of us roll our eyes at multi-hour download times for new games?Once gigabit internet becomes the norm (it’s common place in a lot of countries already, but it’s not quite the norm yet) then you’ll see more and more services upscale to support it, and thus others on the cutting edge of the tech curve finding that gigabit internet isn’t quite fast enough any more. And that will happen sooner than you think. reply stephenr 19 hours agorootparent> 4k on a lot of streaming services is compressed to hell and back to work with people on slower internet connections.A 4K UltraHD Bluray (that&#x27;s 100GB for one movie) has a maximum bitrate of \"just\" 144Mbps.

We Automated Bullshit. Submitted by Alan Blackwell on Thu, 09/11/2023 - 15:49 ChatGPT is a bullshit generator. To understand AI, we should think harder about bullshit This post appears in a blog created in 2019 to focus on AI in Africa. Long before the release of ChatGPT, many wondered why AI would be relevant to Africans. But I’m writing in a week when US President Biden published an executive order on AI, and British PM Rishi Sunak listened enthusiastically to Elon Musk promising a magical AI future where nobody needs to work. When the richest man in the world talks up a storm with NATO leaders, Africa will get blown around in those political and economic winds. Since my fieldwork in Africa, I’ve learned to ask different questions about AI, and in recent months, I’ve started to feel like the boy who questions the emperor’s new clothes. The problem I see, apparently not reported in coverage of Sunak’s AI Summit, is that AI literally produces bullshit. (Do I mean “literally”? My friends complain that I take everything literally, but I’m not a kleptomaniac). MIT Professor of AI Rodney Brooks summarises the working principle of ChatGPT as “it just makes up stuff that sounds good”. This is mathematically accurate, where “sounds good” is an algorithm to imitate text found on the internet, while “makes up” is the basic randomness of relying on predictive text rather than logic or facts. Other leading researchers and professors of AI say the same things, with more technical detail, as in the famous “stochastic parrots” paper by Emily Bender, Timnit Gebru and their colleagues, or Murray Shanahan’s explanation of the text prediction principles (references below). “Godfather of AI” Geoff Hinton, in recent public talks, explains that one of the greatest risks is not that chatbots will become super-intelligent, but that they will generate text that is super-persuasive without being intelligent, in the manner of Donald Trump or Boris Johnson. In a world where evidence and logic are not respected in public debate, Hinton imagines that systems operating without evidence or logic could become our overlords by becoming superhumanly persuasive, imitating and supplanting the worst kinds of political leader. If this isn’t about evidence or logic, what is the scientific principle involved? Quite simply, we are talking about bullshit. Philosopher Harry Frankfurt, in his classic text On Bullshit, explains that the bullshitter “does not reject the authority of truth, as the liar does […] He pays no attention to it at all.” This is exactly what senior AI researchers such as Brooks, Bender, Shanahan and Hinton are telling us, when they explain how ChatGPT works. The problem, as Frankfurt explains, is that “[b]y virtue of this, bullshit is a greater enemy of the truth than lies are.” (p. 61). At a time when a public enquiry is reporting the astonishing behaviour of our most senior leaders during the Covid pandemic, the British people wonder how we came to elect such such bullshitters to lead us. But as Frankfurt observes, “Bullshit is unavoidable whenever circumstances require someone to talk without knowing what he is talking about” (p.63) Perhaps this explains why the latest leader of the same government is so impressed by AI, and by billionaires promoting automated bullshit generators? But Frankfurt’s book is not the only classic text on bullshit. David Graeber’s famous analysis of Bullshit Jobs explains precisely why Elon Musk’s claim to the British PM is so revealing of the true nature of AI. Graeber revealed that over 30% of British workers believe their own job contributes nothing of any value to society. These are people who spend their lives writing pointless reports, relaying messages from one person to another, or listening to complaints they can do nothing about. Every part of their job could easily be done by ChatGPT. Graeber observes that aspects of university education prepare young people to expect little more from life, training them to submit to bureaucratic processes, while writing reams of text that few will ever read. In the kind of education that produces a Boris Johnson, verbal fluency and entertaining arguments may be rewarded more highly than close attention to the truth. As Graeber says, we train people for bullshit jobs by training them to generate bullshit. So is Elon Musk right, that nobody will have to work any more once AI is achieved? Perhaps so, if producing bullshit is the only kind of work we need - and you can see how the owner of (eX)Twitter might see the world that way. AI systems like ChatGPT are trained with text from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and other huge archives of bullshit, alongside plenty of actual facts (including Wikipedia and text ripped off from professional writers). But there is no algorithm in ChatGPT to check which parts are true. The output is literally bullshit, exactly as defined by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, and as we would expect from Graeber’s study of bullshit jobs. Just as Twitter encourages bullshitting politicians who don’t care whether what they say is true or false, the archives of what they have said can be used to train automatic bullshit generators. The problem isn’t AI. What we need to regulate is the bullshit. Perhaps the next British PM should convene a summit on bullshit, to figure out whose jobs are worthwhile, and which ones we could happily lose?

LLMs seem to operate on the principle of \"will this pass for a correct answer\" rather than \"this is how this thing works, so here&#x27;s a reasonable opinion answering your question\".However at some point you have to admit the LLM does generate things that are good answers. They might be good answers that happen to pass the smell test, but they are nonetheless good answers. For instance when you ask it for a snippet of code and it gets it right.And here is the crucial thing: you need to already know what you&#x27;re doing to know whether the LLM got it right. I&#x27;m no historian, and I can ask cGPT for an essay about the causes of the Great War. When I get the answer, it sounds right to me. I don&#x27;t know if the essay talks about the things an actual historian would find important, all I know is that it gives me the vanilla answer that some layman who has read a little bit would think was the right answer.Now there&#x27;s another issue this brings up. Most of us are experts in one field only. What is stopping the LLM from fooling me in every field that I don&#x27;t know anything about? I best be wary of using it outside of my area of expertise.So in the current iteration, I think LLMs are a shortcutting tool for experts. I can tell when it spits out a snippet of code that is correct, and when it&#x27;s wrong. Someone who wasn&#x27;t working in my domain would get fooled. reply indigochill 20 hours agoparent> LLMs seem to operate on the principle of \"will this pass for a correct answer\" rather than \"this is how this thing works, so here&#x27;s a reasonable opinion answering your question\".Isn&#x27;t the hint in the name? It&#x27;s a language model, not a knowledge model. LLMs are exceptional at generating stuff that passes as coherent language (like, the parts of speech are all where one would expect them to be in the sentences). The trouble is people think it goes deeper when the knowledge modeling part only happens incidentally because language and knowledge modeling are so closely related. reply caturopath 19 hours agorootparentNo, you&#x27;re overindexing on the name. It doesn&#x27;t mean that these LLMs are about linguistics and grammar specifically. Clearly, they aren&#x27;t as likely to generate \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" as \"It&#x27;s important to feed your dog\".Obviously, they&#x27;re better at grammar than many other things, but it&#x27;s clear that they contain a vast amount of knowledge. They contain the information that the sky is blue and firetrucks are red, which isn&#x27;t a matter of grammar or coherence, but is simply information about the world. reply capableweb 19 hours agorootparent> It doesn&#x27;t mean that these LLMs are about linguistics and grammar specifically.Correct. But it does mean they&#x27;re about \"language\" rather than knowledge. It&#x27;s meant to read, parse and generate language, no matter if it includes prose, facts, knowledge or whatever.> Clearly, they aren&#x27;t as likely to generate \"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\" as \"It&#x27;s important to feed your dog\".Clearly, as the training set probably contains much more instances of the latter, than the first example. And if it&#x27;s more probable to generate, that&#x27;s the text it&#x27;ll generate. It doesn&#x27;t understand why or how, just that it&#x27;s more likely, so that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s going. reply caturopath 19 hours agorootparent> it does mean they&#x27;re about \"language\" rather than knowledgeNot really. It was invented because they were trained on natural language corpuses. It wasn&#x27;t a deep, philosophical concept.It continues to be used for models that are doing completely non-languagy stuff, such as robotics, although I expect the growing use of &#x27;foundation model&#x27; or some other less-confusing term will likely replace it. reply QuantumGood 16 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]it does mean they&#x27;re about \"language\" rather than knowledgeLanguage in part encodes knowledge. reply smoldesu 13 hours agorootparentIt also encodes opinions, fantasy, bad-faith arguments and lies without discrimination. Given that LLMs aren&#x27;t trained to separate their sources, I think it&#x27;s fair to say today&#x27;s AI focuses more on language than the integrity of it&#x27;s answer. reply QuantumGood 10 hours agorootparentAgreed, discriminating what language contains is the issue. reply tbrownaw 17 hours agorootparentprev> But it does mean they&#x27;re about \"language\" rather than knowledge.To some extent, those are kind of the same thing. reply tivert 17 hours agorootparent> To some extent, those are kind of the same thing.They are not the same thing. They are not even \"kind of\" the same thing, for any reasonable definition of \"kind of.\" That should be obvious, because a lie is language, which is pretty close to the opposite of knowledge.I mean no offense, but your hedging words are doing so much work that I think your statement counts as bullshit.Edit: thinking about it more, I think your comment shows the particular kind of bullshit that often characterizes tech people&#x27;s thinking and is so useful for hyping shit (e.g. take something hard, lossily reformulate it into something easier but vaguely similar, solve the easy thing, then declare you solved the hard thing). reply tbrownaw 15 hours agorootparentA language is a particular way of serializing concepts and their relationships.Knowledge is... concepts and their relationships, typically with the implication of being grounded in objective reality (although one can be knowledgeable about things like, say, Tolkien, or Star Wars, or fantasy tropes more generally)..Language is (a particular way of representing) knowledge, in about the same way that a particular .cpp file is (a particular way of representing) a linked list or whatever. reply tivert 12 hours agorootparent> Language is (a particular way of representing) knowledge, in about the same way that a particular .cpp file is (a particular way of representing) a linked list or whatever.So, in your view, are .cpp files and linked lists \"kind of\" the same thing?Language can be used to express some kinds of knowledge, but they&#x27;re not even \"kind of\" synonymous. Language can express a lot of things that aren&#x27;t knowledge, and there&#x27;s knowledge that can&#x27;t be expressed with language (qualia, at least). reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparentprevOf course they are the same thing. Language as humans use it isn&#x27;t a god-given perfect formal grammar system. It&#x27;s people grunting and gulping about what they experience, for many thousand of years, each generation picking up the patterns from the generation before, and adding to them. Language was, is, and always has been about knowledge, because you literally build the language skill up from correlations.All the more and less formal models we invent for describing \"language\"? This is just fitting curves to a snapshot of reality. So sure, \"a lie is language, which is pretty close to the opposite of knowledge\" - a lie can be expressed in the formal model. But the truth (as subjectively understood) is much more likely to be spoken or written down in practice.Communication isn&#x27;t random. Language isn&#x27;t random. Learning it is picking up the patterns. reply tivert 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m having trouble understanding why you&#x27;d respond with that. Are you interpreting knowledge to mean knowledge-of-language or something?>>>> But it does mean they&#x27;re about \"language\" rather than knowledge.>>> To some extent, those are kind of the same thing.>> They are not the same thing.> Of course they are the same thing.Language and knowledge (both broadly construed) are obviously not the same thing. Language can encode non-knowledge like nonsense or lies, and there is knowledge (e.g. of the experience of qualia) that can&#x27;t be expressed in language.I think the point up-thread is true: something that knows only about how language is unreliable source of knowledge. Even if all its input is true knowledge, it can still blindly combine that input in linguistically plausible but false ways. reply tessierashpool 16 hours agorootparentprevthey really are not.you can use language as a proxy for knowledge in some cases, but doing so guarantees generating bullshit, which is the entire point of the OP. reply FeepingCreature 18 hours agorootparentprevLanguage is about knowledge.If it wasn&#x27;t, what would we be doing here? reply lukev 19 hours agorootparentprevI would argue they do not contain knowledge using the classic definition of knowledge as \"justified true belief.\"They can emit statements that happen to be true because the probabilities fall that way (as a sibling comment points out.) But it&#x27;s not \"justified\", because models don&#x27;t have any ability to remember or cite sources, or even internally classify tokens as true or false (it&#x27;s all just weights.)(And it&#x27;s not a \"belief\", either, because there&#x27;s no intentionality, but that&#x27;s a more slippery concept.)Therefore, philosophically speaking, it is fundamentally impossible to acquire knowledge from a LLM unless you verify (\"justify\") a statement via some secondary, more trustworthy channel. reply caturopath 19 hours agorootparentI tried to mention containing knowledge to avoid a discussion like this: not &#x27;knowing&#x27; or &#x27;having knowledge&#x27; or something that could lead to a discussion like this, which I don&#x27;t think aligns with the point I was trying to make, which is that top LLMs are not merely good at things like grammar, but that a key part of what they do has to do about information about the world.FWIW, although &#x27;justified true belief&#x27; is classic in the sense of being an old definition of knowledge, I don&#x27;t think any significant number of modern philosophers would use it. reply lukev 18 hours agorootparentWell, they&#x27;re concerned with Gettier problems etc too.But yeah the problem what you mean by \"knowing.\" For example, I am perfectly happy to say that a LLM \"knows\" words just like I \"know\" words, or that it \"knows about\" very popular topics in a loose sense.But that&#x27;s a very different sense of \"knows\" from the kind of specific propositional knowledge we&#x27;re usually interested in when using a LLM as a search engine, fact checker or source of information! reply Filligree 18 hours agorootparentprevBy that definition of knowledge, I don’t contain knowledge either.I’m clearly keeping track of how strongly I believe a variety of things. Not how I started believing them to begin with, however, so I lack the justification. And in a lot of cases, the lost justification would have been: “Because someone else said it, so now I’m aping them.” reply lukev 18 hours agorootparentI mean, this is why philosophical skepticism is a thing. There&#x27;s hundreds of books written on epistemology.But I think almost none of them would ascribe \"knowledge\" to a statistical engine that output propositions of random truth values weighted by how many examples of that proposition it&#x27;s seen in it&#x27;s training data.You can view the logprobs in the API and literally watch it choose to say different things based on it&#x27;s internal dice rolls. reply williamcotton 18 hours agorootparentWhat we have that an LLM doesn’t have is a mobile body and other sensory inputs so we can verify knowledge through practice.Knowledge without a feedback mechanism for verification is prone to veer off course.Right now the feedback mechanism is based on human reinforcement.What if we put an LLM in an android’s body and let the machine interact with the world through the same senses that we do? reply lukev 17 hours agorootparentA body may be a necessary condition for epistemological knowledge, but it&#x27;s certainly not sufficient... most animals are embodied but do not possess propositional knowledge (IMO anyway.)Ultimately though this is all about the definition of words. Humans find the distinction between \"true\" and \"false\" to be important and meaningful; animals don&#x27;t care. AIs don&#x27;t care (being incapable of caring), but humans care very much about the propositional veracity of statements that AI makes.The important thing is that we&#x27;re on the same page about what&#x27;s actually happening with these systems and how they work and don&#x27;t slip into magical thinking or assume that just because a system is facile with language it automatically has a sense of truth or right or wrong.This is only going to get more complicated as models get more sophisticated. reply ganzuul 14 hours agorootparent> most animals are embodied but do not possess propositional knowledgehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=yhfl7kasjZcThere are a quite a few videos with the same reaction. There does seem to be something going on. replygorjusborg 19 hours agorootparentprev> but it&#x27;s clear that they contain a vast amount of knowledge.Is it though?There&#x27;s nuance in what we call knowledge, but to me, knowledge is not uni-dimensional. What I mean by that is, I know when I _know_ something, and I have learned that that is not a trivial skill.How do I know I _know_ something? Usually because I have searched for evidence from multiple angles &#x2F; dimensions &#x2F; senses. When multiple independent observations of quality agree, and my conclusion matches the result, it is safe to say that I know that fact.An LLM may have multiple &#x27;dimensions&#x27; in a linear algebra sense, but does it have independent information? reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparent> How do I know I _know_ something? Usually because I have searched for evidence from multiple angles &#x2F; dimensions &#x2F; senses. When multiple independent observations of quality agree, and my conclusion matches the result, it is safe to say that I know that fact.This is technically true, but no one actually does much of it consciously. But this is how you picked up every skill and understanding, including language, since you&#x27;ve been born.And this - the unconscious fusion of correlated patterns - is pretty much what LLMs undergo in training.EDIT:Also, a lot of confusion is created by using terms like \"a fact\" or \"a conclusion\" or \"a result\", as if they were fixed points in space, fully defined mathematical symbols. But there exist no such thing. There is no binary \"know&#x2F;don&#x27;t know\", there is no binary \"result match&#x2F;does&#x27;t match the conclusion\". Those are all continuous quantities, that get rounded off for convenience. reply caturopath 18 hours agorootparentprevFor what it&#x27;s worth, I mentioned they _contain_ the knowledge to try to avoid discussions about whether they really \"know\" anything -- if there&#x27;s a better term like &#x27;information about the world&#x27; or something, I think that&#x27;s all I was trying to tell the original person I replied to. The point wasn&#x27;t that they do what humans do, but that they are not just grammar machines.> How do I know I _know_ something? Usually because I have searched for evidence from multiple angles &#x2F; dimensions &#x2F; senses. When multiple independent observations of quality agree, and my conclusion matches the result, it is safe to say that I know that fact.I wanted to thank you for laying out this perspective. In my experience, in discussions about LLMs, a lot of time people get caught up on words like &#x27;know&#x27; which work well for talking about humans, but don&#x27;t cash them out in definitions I know what to do with.

If LLM were trained on textbooks teaching foreign languages from every other language, the name would suffice.

Consider that history textbooks in many countries look at everything through the lens of a particular national mythology, since one of the goals of a country’s public education is to forge a cohesive society, and that is done by downplaying past controversies.For many other fields, introductory textbooks even at the university level may abound in oversimplifications, and it is only in later years of study that one begins, by reading specialized papers and monographs, to grasp how complicated the facts really are. reply PaulHoule 19 hours agoparentprevMaybe I should be impressed that an algorithm can sort a list correctly 50% of a time because it is better than chance (ex. you have 1 in 3.6 million odds of sorting a list of 10 items correctly at random) but conventionally the value of a 50% sorting algorithm is 0, not 50% that of a sort that works since the sort is part of a larger system that requires the sort to work 100% of the time.For a long time there have been \"machine learning\" techniques where getting the right answer 80% of the time is a win, what&#x27;s interesting about LLMs is they sometimes \"raise the bar\" for the machine learning problems (get it right 90% of the time) but have also lowered the bar for other things that can be done algorithmically 100% of the time. reply pjerem 19 hours agorootparentThe thing is, if you want to sort a list, LLM is the wrong tool. However, if what you want is to generate a program that will sort a list, your LLM will be pretty performant.It’s a powerful tool but like any powerful tool, you will use it wrongly if you don’t acknowledge its strengths and weaknesses.Judging a LLM because he can’t act as a program is a fundamental error because it means you are wasting an enormous amount of resources for nothing.The novelty of LLMs and where they are good at is helping you thinking about things.

What they found is that the strongest predictor of success was whether a player could utilise the software effectively, rather than pure chess skill.Another area where I don&#x27;t think there are any published studies, but there&#x27;s a lot of anecdotal evidence, is algorithmic trading, where successful firms almost always have human traders monitoring the algorithmic behaviour. This means that humans can spot when the algorithm is doing something a bit odd, or when conditions aren&#x27;t conducive to the algorithm performing well, and they can tweak some parameters on the algorithm to get a better result, shut it down if it looks like it&#x27;s lost the plot, etc. (And let&#x27;s be honest, a lot of this oversight is probably a result of Knight Capital.)My point here is: You&#x27;re entirely right, LLMs are currently a tool for people with experience in the field they&#x27;re working with. But that&#x27;s still a pretty big step forward -- just like top quant hedge funds consistently outperform human-managed funds (see: Rentech), smart people who learn how to leverage these tools are going to outperform.

It’s especially hard because some of these problems actually are not tractable in the language you’re taking about due to their features, or due to limitations of your code&#x2F;your knowledge it may suggest you do something slightly worse because you haven’t prompted it on factories or other design patterns that you might want to use. reply J_Shelby_J 18 hours agorootparentI’ve had this exact experience with this topic learning python and designing my first app. GPT frequently sent my down the wrong path and wasted my time when I could of just used it to learn about a topic and make my own decisions.It does not hand recursive thinking well at all. reply zerbinxx 18 hours agorootparentAgreed. A good example of this (in Python) is to explore solutions to problems that use decorators&#x2F;a more functional style vs. solutions that use classes and a more OO style.

In the case of encyclopedias or news websites, I guess you could say reputation. But that&#x27;s hardly reliable either.So I guess that&#x27;s my big pushback in regards to correctness complaints:1) \"Official\" sources have always lied, or at least bent the truth, or at least pushed their subjective viewpoint. It has always been the readers job to think critically and cross-reference. On this point, LLM don&#x27;t fundementally change anything, they just bring this long-running tension closer to our attention.2) \"LLM are inaccurate\". Ok, inaccurate compared to what? Academic journals (see the reproducibility crisis), encylopedias (they tend to be accurate by nature of leaving out contentious facts), journalists (big laugh from me)?I think outright hallucinations are a valid concern to bring up, but I would refer to my point about cross-referencing. However, I&#x27;d still point out that oftentimes a person might have read a perfectly factually accurate encyclopedia article but remembered hallucinations via motivated reasoning. Is the end result (what the person thinks and remembers) really different between LLM and traditional sources? This seems like more of a human problem than a LLM problem.Do we have any factual evidance showing that people learning via LLM+traditional methods are actually less informed than people who learn from traditional methods alone? Right now, there&#x27;s a lot of fear mongering and charged rhetoric, and not a lot of facts and studies. The burden of proof needs to fall on the people who want to regulate and restrict access to these models.Finally, what I think this is really about is the continued transfer from the \"industrial age\" to the \"information age\". 100 years ago, your average person wasn&#x27;t expected or really even able to \"do their own research\", and instead relied on top-down elite driven institutions to disseminate their version of the information. De-industrialization, then the internet, then social media, and now LLM are cracking this (now) outdated social order, and our old elites are understandably threatened.I think this is another reason why we need to make this debate more rigorous and fact based: are LLM actually dangerous or is this just an example of elite preference? reply daedalus_j 15 hours agorootparentLLM&#x27;s hallucinate so often when I ask them about software development issues that I don&#x27;t even bother to ask them about areas I&#x27;m unfamiliar with.I think the major difference that makes in not just \"elite preference\" is that the LLM output is just confidently wrong. If I read a report from an elite institution I&#x27;m at least reasonably confident that they&#x27;re not going to base their entire argument on the premise that 2+2=5. Someone is going to call them on it, there may be reputational damage, there may even be legal repercussions in certain cases.LLMs have no such protections. GPT recently, when asked to \"write a function using the ELixir programming language that...\" wrote a function in Elixir syntax using Python libraries and function names. That&#x27;s a class of error that makes it actually dangerous if you&#x27;re asking it about anything you can&#x27;t fully check on your own, and there&#x27;s no checks-and-balances for the content it generates that&#x27;s only ever visible to a single user.I agree with you that \"official\" sources can&#x27;t be trusted and there are inaccuracies everywhere, but you have to admit that the craziest sources who say the craziest things (flat-earthers and such for example) get pretty easily dismissed and everything else they say becomes suspect.

Then, for each reason that looked interesting, I&#x27;d ask the LLM to provide arguments for and against, including one primary historical document in support of each side. Then, go to Google Scholar or similar and look up that document and see what different reputable historians have said about it. A few iterations of this process should get you to some reliable information even in a field you know nothing about.This is a time-consuming process, and requires active engagement rather than what many people have been trained to do by our atrocious education system and watching television, i.e. passive absorption of content without skepticism. reply RandomLensman 19 hours agorootparentIt might or might not work.

You can interact with the LLM using agents, feedback loops, and some scoring function on randomized test inputs to produce novel code that you don&#x27;t know the structure of beforehand.You start with a set of example inputs and desired outputs, and prompt the llm for a function in your programming language of choice. You then take the LLM&#x27;s response and feed it into an agent that executes the code against the inputs and outputs, and report the discrepancies back to the LLM. It responds with a new completion, which you feed to the agent until all your example inputs produce the expected outputs. Finally, you can use property-based testing to produce new examples for testing by the llm, resolving the answers until the produced code is correct to within some margin of acceptable correctness.You can do this to produce code without needing to know anything besides the desired properties of generated code and the properties of the inputs. You can further automate this by using a separate LLM to produce the examples instead of the typical generation and shrinking functions to produce examples.This doesn&#x27;t require any prior knowledge of the target language. You can expand beyond programming into any domain for which you can produce a scoring function and automate input generation.I suspect that you can use control theory (PID loops, behavior choice loops scored by Eigenvalues) to model complex scenarios spanning multiple domains as well, choosing the evaluation agent as the behavior, each behavior of which has a separately defined scoring function. All of this can be automated by using the LLM generator without prior knowledge of the algorithmic structure of the solution and knowledge of all possible inputs to all possible behaviors.If that all sounds very familiar, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s essentially just doing test-driven development, but with the LLM machine as the developer.It would be expensive to run an entire project development that way, due to the high costs of executing LLMs and&#x2F;or querying LLM apis, but if the cost is less than that of employing a junior developer or teams of developers, it might be worth it. And human intervention can be kept in the loop at any stage, making it very feasible for rapid prototyping - where you don&#x27;t necessarily need the entirely correct answer from the machine, just a good enough starting point to allow the human to take over to produce a result. reply falserum 19 hours agorootparent> You can do this to produce code without needing to know anything besides properties …Reminder, you started with this:> You can interact with the LLM using agents, feedback loops, and some scoring function on randomized test inputsMaybe those are fancy words for simple things which I’m not familiar with or learning programming language seems a simpler option :) reply 3cats-in-a-coat 20 hours agoparentprev> LLMs seem to operate on the principle of \"will this pass for a correct answer\" rather than \"this is how this thing works, so here&#x27;s a reasonable opinion answering your question\".That&#x27;s NOT how LLMs operate. They&#x27;re trained on what is supposed to be selected representative human text of some at least minimum quality, and ideally truthful, factual and relevant.And then their prediction is judged on how close to that ground truth it is. Not on whether it&#x27;s \"plausible\" or \"will this pass for a correct answer\". There&#x27;s no math function for pretending to be right. You have to be right.One reason why LLMs make up things sometimes is because they&#x27;re incredibly tightly optimized. Like you have no idea how tight. GPT-4 has the comparable complexity of a mouse brain. A mouse brain that has to fit the world&#x27;s knowledge.Obviously, something has to give, and you&#x27;ll not be accurate sometimes when you have so limited space.

But of course you can filter the input.The fact you also add conversational input from various sources like Reddit and Twitter doesn&#x27;t change this balance significantly. Also even those sources are filtered to exclude vulgarities, certain topics and so on.Also you&#x27;re not thinking this through.

However, a problem arises from using generalized web content as the ground truth training data. That&#x27;s a problem because the generalized web is chock full of political propaganda, marketing exaggerations, and real people parroting that with partial and complete misunderstandings of it all, with others of the same incorrect understanding.Perhaps in the future, the training data will be more carefully curated to eliminate as many &#x27;wishful truths that do not exist&#x27; and &#x27;misinformed conversations between parties with no correct voice&#x27; as possible. reply 3cats-in-a-coat 14 hours agorootparentThanks for your comment of support. Ironically the \"groupthink\" is hallucinating explanations about how LLMs work, irony.Anyway, yes, the \"web\" in general is full of garbage and propaganda. But then again we&#x27;re exposed to the same web, and without the pre-processing which OpenAI etc. apply to filter out certain words, phrases, topics (including lots of manual human labor). So it&#x27;s funny how we&#x27;re living on that same input, but we&#x27;re so confident we know what&#x27;s true and what&#x27;s wrong.But LLMs aren&#x27;t just trained on literally anything on the web. For example consider Wikipedia. That&#x27;s not one&#x27;s average drivel for sure. And next to the general web, you need higher quality sources of data in the mix to bias the AI for truth. Scientific papers, good books, transcripts from conferences and presentations. Wikipedia to mention again. So on.Of course, sometimes LLM make technical mistakes which you can clearly rule as incorrect. Say, plumbus.com&#x27;s API never had a method getDescription(). But the AI saw many APIs of services like this, which have API getDescription() and given its small network, it&#x27;s forced to fill-in gaps by inferring the answer based on a vast assortment of contextual clues. Which we call hallucinations (incorrectly). But even the correct answers are inferred. It&#x27;s all inference. And we all think by inference. We just have 50 times more capacity than the biggest LLM at the moment, so our inference tends to be much more sophisticated, and therefore more likely to be correct. I mean in theory. After all, it&#x27;s humans and their big brains who produced the garbage that&#x27;s the web, so. reply bsenftner 13 hours agorootparentI agree with your points, but would also like to point out humans are not exposed to the general web as infants, and only a curated exposure until they become smart enough get through the various age restrictions placed weakly here and there.Children&#x27;s initial years, being basically lied to about the nature of the adult world, is where their sophisticated inference comes from. The internal intellectual conflict when one realizes it is actually good to tell children the world is a nice, fair, happy place - once figuring out it is not. That right there, I theorize, is where our sophisticated inference is created: we realize our own dynamic minds. We realize the necessity to seat concepts of \"a fair world\" into people before allowing them to mentally mature and learn it is not. reply agentultra 19 hours agoparentprev> I can tell when it spits out a snippet of code that is correct, and when it&#x27;s wrong.Hah, sure.

And that&#x27;s a problem.Second, the fundamental issue here is that as long as verification is needed, this technology is only ever useful for domains in which you&#x27;re already an expert. That severely limits the technology, and yet this keeps being touted as some kind of general knowledge base when clearly it&#x27;s at best a very narrow one.And it seems to me like this is unlikely to be solved in the current paradigm.

But you are all mistaken if you think its going to stay this bad. If you haven&#x27;t even bothered to check how quickly the field has moved from single-modal to multi-modal, well, damn guys, I am sorry, but you are getting automated first.The biggest problem with current models is that they don&#x27;t know how to verify their own answers, and there&#x27;s no way to allow them to without putting a ministry of truth on it (similar to what twitter was during covid).To combat this, we need to figure out how to let the model generalize truth, which is something it can only do if fed enough (unfiltered, unbiased) data. With enough data, it will find the patterns underlying false information and eventually figure out how to use it.In fact, most likely, the future models will simply be fed unlabeled data, in any format (audio, video, telemetry, analytics) and generalize from that.The concept of feeding normalized data to a model for training is archaic and stupid. The world is not normalized. Data is not always the same, and will not always even be guaranteed to be present.Anyways, what does it matter.Why am I trying to sell sugar to people addicted to salt? reply latexr 18 hours agorootparent> So I guess I am overestimating the average user by assuming that people read the text written on every single page they use to query the system.Yes, you definitely are.

That can be useful depending on what you want to do, but it doesn&#x27;t strike me as the most effective architecture for them.(They are also reasonably good pattern fitters, what is kinda nice for code autocompletion on some languages.

Loosely-speaking, when AI generates NL text it relies on LLMs for context, structure, length etc, a kinda \"the model suggests so\". However, where content is computer code, even computers can test & verify the output. With NL content on the other hand, the end-user has to essentially test & verify the output to establish truth, meaning.In my view, the main difference between a Human Bullshitter and a Automated Bullshitter, is that AI can potentially improve exponentially (as smart tech does), thus leaving the end-user (average person) severely overwhelmed. reply em500 19 hours agoparentprev> If that&#x27;s true, why then did it take me 10 seconds yesterday to find an extremely obscure fact of 18th century history with ChatGPT 3.5?

Obviously, because Google was completely useless to you, you didn&#x27;t simply use Google to do that validation, nor could you have used another search engine, because then you could have found the result you were looking for to begin with.

Not even ChatGPT can explain to you why it did that or keeps doing this.How can you trust it to give the right answer (without you Googling to check) if you really don&#x27;t know the answer? It already means you don&#x27;t trust it an you know it bullshits as the author has claimed.It can confidently convince someone outside of one&#x27;s own expertise that it can give a soundly correct answer but can easily be bullshitting nonsense.> Well. Any philosopher, mathematician, scientist, or novelist was trained on plenty of actual facts (established works of other people, school learning, experiments) and huge archives of bullshit (individual day-to-day experiences that cannot be called scientific, casual conversations just like Twitter conversations, propaganda, lies). Their output then would also be bullshit, and by extension, everything humanity ever created.The difference is with humans, they can be transparently held to account on whatever they say. An AI system cannot. So this actual whataboutism towards humans is incredibly weak here and a common excuse by AI proponents supporting the nonsense that AI systems like ChatGPT can uncontrollably generate in a black box system. reply adamsb6 20 hours agoprevI think LLMs have revealed that we have at least two ways of thinking.One is analogous to how LLMs operate and is essentially next token prediction. Think of your mental state when you’re very engrossed in conversation. It’s not a truly conscious act. Sometimes you even surprise yourself. If you’re a child, or childish, you may just confabulate things in the moment, maybe without realizing that you’re doing it in the moment.Now think of some very difficult problem you’ve had to solve. It’s not the same, right? It’s a very conscious act, directing your focus here and there, trying to reason on how everything fits together and what you might change to fix your problem. Odds are good that you’re not even using language to model the problem in your head.LLMs are doing the first thing, and are exceptionally good at it even in this early stage. The surprising thing to me is how far this can get you. If you have an inhuman level of knowledge to work from then in conversation mode you can actually solve some moderately difficult problems.I think that maps to our own experiences as well. For the things that you have deep knowledge on you will sometimes find yourself solving a problem just by constructing sentences. reply emmender1 19 hours agoparentnice analogy between the output of llms with stream of thought conversation - wherein statements are made off the cuff and possibly confabulated. as opposed to correlating statements with knowledge structuresknowledge structures as we construct it are symbolic, with symbols representing abstractions (ie classes), along with relations between these symbols. human ingenuity consists of coming up with new symbols or new relations between existing symbols (which is a process of abduction) based on new perceptual inputs (either our senses or instruments). Such knowledge structures are powerful because, they allow us to build giant towers based on solid foundations.> For the things that you have deep knowledge on you > will sometimes find yourself solving a problem > just by constructing sentences.This is another way of saying that you have clarity in that subject, and so your stream of thought aligns with knowledge structures - which is another to say that you really understand something. However, in my experience very few people are able to stay within their lanes (competence), and most of us tend to babble on topics we really dont have knowledge structures for. also, few people have the self-awareness of what they really have knowledge structures for (ie, know what they dont know). reply firejake308 20 hours agoparentprevThis is the idea of the book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahneman.

I talked with multiple agents and never got a sense of them doing much to push the house other than listing it on MLS and coordinating showings. For the seller agent, they didn&#x27;t even really want to be at the showings -- they&#x27;d just provide a lockbox and give the code to the buyer agent. So where is the value there? On a median home sale, the seller side agent&#x2F;broker is netting $12,400. A lockbox and MLS listing are in the sub-$500 cost range, so where is the additional $12,000 in value?I at least understand the incentive on the buyer side. A buyer can just ring up an agent and have them do their home search for them and coordinate everything. The buyer doesn&#x27;t bear the cost at all, so why not utilize that convenience?Anyway, after talking with a few agents in 2011, I had one recommended to me. He could get deals done quickly and was great to work with, so I was told. I met with him and he wanted to list the house at 8% below the price I thought the house was worth (no bidding wars back then so this was no good) and flat-out refused to reduce the total commission from 6% to 5%.I said \"good riddance\" to the agents and did an MLS self-list for like $400. I set the buyer-side commission at 1.5%. I still got plenty of people looking at the house and sold it for the value I initially established it was worth. So I ended up saving over 10% from what the whiz-kid agent would have cost me in lost value and fees.So back to my original point -- where is that seller value coming from? There isn&#x27;t much legal stuff the agents help with. You need a purchase contract (boilerplate in most cases), some standard state&#x2F;federal disclosure forms, and then the title agency handles everything else. reply stephencanon 20 hours agoparentWe’ve bought two houses, sold one, bought a lot to built a house for my parents. We’ve never hired a real estate agent. The seller had an agent for the first transaction, none of the other counterparties had an agent. Paying a lawyer by the hour to handle things is simpler, cheaper, and a random lawyer is dramatically more competent than a random agent (the most complex transaction ended up costing us maybe $4k in lawyer fees-the standard 6% on that sale would have been $40k!) reply jperras 17 hours agorootparentCanadian here. Sadly, it&#x27;s common practice around these parts for buyer agents to completely ignore listings that don&#x27;t have a selling agent attached; it&#x27;s their form of industry protectionism.As a result you end up losing out on a large surface area of buyers who rely on their buying agent to find properties, which puts you at a disadvantage. reply LeifCarrotson 17 hours agorootparentAre the buyers not getting a feed of every MLS listing in their target area?That entirely solved our purchasing problem - we got automated daily or sometimes hourly emails parametrically filtered by school district, build date, price, square footage, and lot size whenever a new listing went up. It would have been stupid to have our agent filter them based on the deals that were better for him or his industry.We had a uniquely good agent who spent hundreds of hours with us filtering hundreds of listings, visiting probably 60 different houses at all times of day over the course of a year before we finally bought, submitting a dozen offers, and helping us through the closing process, and then using his builder&#x27;s license to help us ready the home we bought for move-in. He was extremely knowledgeable about all kinds of building inspection issues and the procedural minutiae. We happily paid him the 6%, it would have been far more costly to bring along an inspector&#x2F;attorney&#x2F;general contractor at an hourly rate. reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agorootparentprevWebsites have obviated the utility of a buyer’s agent “finding” houses for 90% of buyers.Setup alerts for the type of house you want, draw the geographic boundaries on Zillow, and spend 2 minutes looking at the listing and maps to find out everything an agent would have been able to tell you. reply poulsbohemian 12 hours agorootparent> find out everything an agent would have been able to tell youThese websites are great and I&#x27;m glad the public has the information they have, but they don&#x27;t tell the whole story - especially for someone coming from outside the market.I&#x27;m thinking here of just the last few of my transactions - flood zone issues, title issues, broken sewer lines, pricing, emblements, water rights - like needing to cure in order to preserve, surveying, sub-division, zoning use, farm tax status. Plus finding all the professionals needed to support the process - I&#x27;m spending my day calling plumbers so that I can keep a deal together for buyer and seller, for example.

Perhaps the homes you are finding are not listed in MLS? reply no_wizard 15 hours agorootparentIts possible, but I don&#x27;t think thats the only thing, the reason being that they are listed via Realtors (usually) and I can sometimes find them on other websites (e.g. Redfin) or in the local real estate flyer booklet, but it simply isn&#x27;t on Zillow for some reason.I wish I had a recent example, but I tested this theory multiple times when I was house hunting, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hallucinating the issue. reply tverbeure 16 hours agorootparentprevWhenever we’ve bought a house, we told the agent to not bother sending us listings or set up viewings. We simply checked open houses on Redfin and Zillow ourselves, and if we liked a house, we’d ask the agent to prepare an offer, at a price we set. It is not to figure out what a house will sell for if there are enough other sales in that neighborhood.For their reduced work, we’d ask a reduction of their commission. reply kube-system 16 hours agorootparentIn the US, this will severely limit your options. Most houses are posted to MLS first, and don&#x27;t make it to public sites until later. If you want to get the best deals, you gotta have an agent send you MLS listings daily, swoop in and make an offer on the first day before anyone else sees it.When I bought my last house, my agent was able to send me dozens of listings from MLS for homes that weren&#x27;t listed on public websites. reply tverbeure 16 hours agorootparentThat was not our experience in California.One of our agents would still send MLS postings to us.

It could easily be worth 6%.Or it may not.Worse: If I use the agent, I don&#x27;t know whether the agent gained me 6% of the price in the negotiations. If I don&#x27;t use the agent, I don&#x27;t know if I cost myself 6% of the price (or more!) in the negotiations.Someone could do a study, looking at sale prices of \"for sale by owner\" versus sale prices of comparable sales through agents, for comparable periods. Even that study is fraught - for us to trust it, it would have to be by non-realtors, but also by people not involved in the \"for sale by owner\" world in some way. And yet the study would have to get the comparables right - not just right, but clearly right, so that the results of the study will be believed.Without such a study, we&#x27;re all kind of just believing what we believe. reply matwood 18 hours agorootparent> Negotiations could easily be worth $40K.I&#x27;m a better negotiator than any agent I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.

I am absolutely willing to pay a realtor to negotiate for me (and in general to have knowledge of the market and know how to find the real market price) because I suck at negotiating and have no idea how to do it. reply tgma 15 hours agorootparentWell, the average real estate agent is also a shit negotiator on your behalf. The incentive structure makes it so irrespective of the skill set. The agent’s primary job is to sell themselves to you when they get the listing not to sell your house at max price. On the buy side they are also incentivized to close the deal rather than make you do a wise bid. That said during a bidding war, if you are a buyer and your agent is a rando or you don’t have one, the seller agent almost certainly will give the last word to their buddies in the industry so you’ll lose the bidding war. That’s about the only value I’ve seen an agent provide. reply matwood 12 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t consider myself to be a master negotiator at all, but I can look at Zillow and know how much I want to spend or how much I want to sell for. The internet has removed a vast majority of the information asymmetry involved in house transactions. reply j4yav 18 hours agorootparentprevAre buyer agents also paid at a % of the closing price? If so they also have an incentive to get their clients to pay more for the house. reply kemayo 17 hours agorootparentI think that technically the seller&#x27;s agent is the one given that 6%, but then they split it with the buyer&#x27;s agent 50&#x2F;50.The argument I&#x27;ve seen made is that the buyer&#x27;s agent&#x27;s motivation to lower the price comes from wanting their client to actually make the purchase. That said, I&#x27;d think that this is only motivating them to get down to the highest price that the buyer will accept paying, rather than the actual lowest price that&#x27;s theoretically possible. reply corethree 18 hours agorootparentprevTrue. But agents aren&#x27;t incentivized to negotiate lower prices because payment on both sides is proportional to total price sold. So logically only sellers would benefit from this. reply scarface_74 18 hours agorootparentActually they are. It’s about volume not the few extra pennies they get on a sale - especially once you consider the brokerage takes some of that money.The Freakonomics book went into this in detail.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;freakonomics.com&#x2F;2008&#x2F;02&#x2F;real-estate-agents-revisite...If your house sales for $50K more, each agent gets $1500 more and the brokerage gets 20-40% of that. Let’s say 30%. That means the agent will get a little over $1000 extra.They would much rather sell your house for $50K less and move on than convincing you to hold out for $50K more. reply moduspol 17 hours agorootparentThis. Though also worth noting: these agents are often working with the same small pool of other agents throughout their career. Their relationship with them is often more valuable than with any individual client, so it doesn&#x27;t really pay for them to be adversarial on behalf of their client. Both agents are incentivized to keep a healthy working relationship and focus on closing the sale despite the commission percentage. reply cyanydeez 16 hours agorootparentright and their negotiations are likely synthetic and geared towards mass deal making, which distorts the market in nuclear ways.if we&#x27;re all for transparent markets, these commissions interfere and it doesn&#x27;t matter how close to reality they are as we can agree that they&#x27;re largely not real, but synthetic amalgamations of something not related to the market. reply dragonwriter 16 hours agorootparentprev> But agents aren&#x27;t incentivized to negotiate lower prices because payment on both sides is proportional to total price soldTypically, agents (on both sides) are incentivized to doing whatever makes the sale happen with the least time, risk, and effort, because what they lose on commission if that involves a (not extraordinarily unreasonable) price cut they make up for in volume. reply j45 17 hours agorootparentprevThere is insurance on real estate transactions for a reason.Not exclusive to realtors.Many realtors works take a consulting fee too navigate things. Try. reply MarkusWandel 17 hours agorootparentI never understood Title Insurance. Isn&#x27;t the whole point of a lawyer handling the transaction to look for potential gotchas? As opposed to just rubber stamp it and let the insurance handle it if something does come up? reply poulsbohemian 15 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s an example: I&#x27;ve got a house under contract and in the title report it shows that in 1906 (!!) the then owner of the land (prior to the house being built in 1946) signed away mineral and timber rights. Unclear at this point who those rights belong to, but doesn&#x27;t appear to be the homeowner. In another case, I had a seller client who had been a victim of title fraud on a piece of scrub land. Title insurance is something you hope to never need, and admittedly it mostly involves family esoteric scenarios, but it really is there to protect buyer and seller in their ability to convey property. reply j45 16 hours agorootparentprevOne case is titles don’t transfer instantly.

I only ever bought one house, in 2005, and I&#x27;m still living in it. But I seem to recall that the agent - a good one, referred by friends, and referred onward - had a boilerplate contract in which I was responsible for his commission even if I independently bought a FSBO (pronounced \"fizzbo\" in realtor lingo, i.e. completely off-system For Sale By Owner house) during the contract period. I had that scratched out before signing.For realtors it&#x27;s very simple. Why spend time on something they won&#x27;t get paid for? Why bother arranging a tour of a FSBO house, unless that one says \"agents welcome\" in its listing which means they will pay the buyer agent fee. But if that contract is standard, what&#x27;s the disincentive? Just the unpleasantness of actually enforcing it when necessary?Common here seem to be \"flat rate MLS listing\" services, where you pay a few hundred dollars and they list it, and you&#x27;re your own selling agent.

I trusted mine and saw no red flags during, or after the transaction. He was referred to me by a colleague who is a serial house ownership addict, and I referred him on to several others, and all were pleased.

If both sides had to pay their own agent, significantly fewer agents would be used. Instead the buyer externalizes the cost, and many sellers aren’t confident enough to deal with the buyer’s agent directly so they arm themselves with an agent. reply koolba 20 hours agorootparentThe buyer is paying the agent in the addition to the sale price.The buyer is also paying additional taxes for many years afterward on the higher assessed value (as it includes the commission!). reply voisin 18 hours agorootparent> The buyer is paying the agent in the addition to the sale price.Well I guess this gets a bit philosophical. Who pays the cost (the actual payment goes from the buyer to the seller’s lawyer which remits a portion to the agent) differs from who bears the cost (called the “incidence” [0]), which depends on the price elasticity of demand versus the price elasticity of supply, and this burden obviously shifts depending on the cycle of the housing market. You are correct that the incidence would fall to the buyer for quite some time now but perhaps this is shifting now.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tax_incidence reply cgh 17 hours agorootparentprevCorrect.

If you&#x27;ve heard that language from an agent, it&#x27;s a good sign they were either new to the business or dropping soundbites to sound knowledgable. reply tylersmith 17 hours agorootparentprevMoney is only one half of a trade. Giving up some value of an asset when trading it is also form of payment. reply kelnos 17 hours agorootparentprevThis pisses me off quite a bit. A simple fix could be to have the realtors bill for their services outside the purchase contract (which could still spell out those fees in a legally binding manner). The closing costs we pay to the title company aren&#x27;t included in the purchase price, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense that the realtor fees should be either. reply seanmcdirmid 18 hours agorootparentprevHome assessments are based on property value, not sales prices, in many jurisdictions. reply koolba 18 hours agorootparentSales prices (for an arms length sale) are de facto assessments.

That&#x27;s how it works everywhere in the US. reply poulsbohemian 14 hours agorootparentExcept it&#x27;s actually more nuanced than that, and this is important... the client actually has a contract with a brokerage, where their agent is actually a sub-agent. The commission fee goes to the brokerage and in many cases the agent doesn&#x27;t have the ability to negotiate it with the client (despite being an independent contractor). When the commission is paid, it is paid to the listing brokerage and then split out according to the agreement - some to the listing agent, and then in many cases to the buyer&#x27;s brokerage who then splits it with the buyer&#x27;s agent according to their agreement.This is all important because there&#x27;s a layer of legalities and agency relationships that the public completely ignores, but is relevant if we&#x27;re going to have a conversation about commissions. It&#x27;s also relevant because some states have begun to change their laws to be more in line with what the public thinks happens, which has its own weird twists.*Brokers and lawyers in the audience will probably say I&#x27;m still handwaving away some nuances here regarding agency laws. Mea culpa, I&#x27;m trying to keep this simple. reply PaulDavisThe1st 18 hours agorootparentprevExcept in a for-sale-by-owner scenario, where the seller is not using an agent. In those scenarios, it may be necessary to agree to a fee paid directly by the seller to a buyer&#x27;s agent. 2-3% is typical. This is not always necessary - some buyers will not be using an agent either, but it is not rare. reply kelnos 16 hours agorootparentThe thing that&#x27;s excessively dumb about even that approach is that the buyer almost certainly would prefer to pay their realtor directly, outside of the purchase price. Since property tax assessments usually just follow the purchase price directly, I&#x27;d much rather purchase the house for $485k and give my agent $15k separately, than have my tax assessment be based on a $500k purchase price where the seller immediately turns around and gives $15k of that to my realtor. reply jaywalk 18 hours agorootparentprevWell yeah, of course.

When tens of thousands of dollars are at stake, I&#x27;d never rely on AI-generated output.That being said, I also agree with you as for the value of agents, because they&#x27;re the ones who write these contracts and to be honest, most of them are pretty stupid.

For anything that is not open-and-shut (sure, sue the seller if they literally ran away with the earnest money), your specific wording is not going to be worth litigating.Most offers in the US are truly boilerplate, the text being provided by an association of real estate agents, and the wording is not customizable. This of course does depend on your state.Contracts aren&#x27;t worth much more than the paper they&#x27;re on if you&#x27;re not willing to litigate, and there&#x27;s precious few cases where you&#x27;d want to.

You believe that was worthwhile, let&#x27;s assume that was money well spent.Suppose the market was hotter when you sold and your property was worth 2x the median. Is the same work worth $24k? What if you sold in a hot market in a hot neighborhood, which should make it somewhat easier to move the property?

That&#x27;s not really true in the real estate example, where everything is part of a single transaction to which only one party is bringing any actual money.A better analogy would be social security taxes in the US. In the US, the fiction is that the employer pays for half of an employee&#x27;s social security taxes, and the employee pays for the other half out of their paycheck deductions. But basically every economist considers this a work of fiction, and since the true cost of an employee is everything the employer needs to pay, they basically consider all the social security taxes as costs to the employer. reply ilikehurdles 17 hours agorootparentprevI think their view is that money is fungible, and ultimately factored into the price the buyer pays. The agents aren’t getting paid unless there’s a buyer, so everything in a real estate transaction (the commissions and the property) is paid for using the buyer’s liquid assets.When I’ve been a seller I’d have been willing to lower the price in a slow market more, had commissions not been a factor. Instead I shelved the listing until the market improved because I reached the lowest price I was willing to close at. So in that sense, the buyer is definitely paying for that commission via inflated price. reply gitfan86 16 hours agoparentprevThe worst part of an agent is that they will not show you a house that is for sale by owner.

The individual realtors I know are nice people who work hard, but the industry as a whole is pretty obviously maintained by collusion, and I&#x27;m glad it finally seems to be crumbling. reply kelnos 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t agree on the buyer side. I&#x27;ve been involved in purchasing three homes, and while I did find my realtor&#x27;s help valuable, most of the work to narrow down listings fell to me. Even when my agent pro-actively pushed listings at me, most of them I had already found on Redfin or Zillow.The offer process can be a little confusing, but ultimately it&#x27;s a bunch of standardized forms that everyone should be allowed to download from some government agency or whatever.The negotiation process is in some ways more frustrating when having to go through intermediaries. The only value the realtor provides there is frankly pretty shady: often the two realtors (who usually know each other and have a cordial relationship) will share information about their client that they really shouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve benefited from that type of information, but have felt dirty about it.Ultimately all the legal stuff is handled by a title company (and&#x2F;or a lawyer), and the realtor isn&#x27;t involved there.I think the main places where you can get a better outcome with a realtor are due to industry protectionism, not anything inherently difficult about the process that requires a trained, licensed agent with insider information. reply ineptech 16 hours agorootparentI agree with all of this, I should&#x27;ve said the buyer&#x27;s value can be significant, in terms of hours spent by the agent. I&#x27;ve had agents that toured dozens of properties with me, around a very large area over several months, and didn&#x27;t make a cent because I ended up buying in a different county with a different agent. But that isn&#x27;t so much an example of value-for-money as of a broken market in which agent pay is only tenuously related to job performance. reply komadori 17 hours agorootparentprevThat system seems very convoluted to me. In the UK, only the seller pays a commission on the sale price (typically ~1.5%) and the seller&#x27;s estate agent is responsible for showing buyers around the property. The buyer doesn&#x27;t need their own estate agent unless they&#x27;re also selling a previous property at the same time. reply aftbit 17 hours agorootparentThat seems backwards.

Also, when we were just \"tire-kicking\" and said we had no intent to buy for a year or more, our realtor flat out told us she enjoys seeing new houses and even if we aren&#x27;t ready it&#x27;s good leg-work and research for her to do for other clients anyway. Once we found one she was excellent at getting us to the right people for financing, inspections, etc. - in a very small local market. She was also incredibly helpful when we were trying to find a temporary rental from across the ocean remotely, which is what led us to ask her to help find a house to buy eventually.On the seller side, we left the country, and my realtor sold our house at an amount that covered his commission and then some with almost no effort from us at all. He had the place cleaned, staged, and photographed as part of his fee, and sold it in a day.Yes, I&#x27;m sure like any occupation there are people bad at their job and just collecting cash for doing damn near nothing, but if you find a good one on either side, they can add a lot.

You have inadvertently projected your DIY savvy onto other homeowners to do the same thing. But, a lot of home sellers don&#x27;t want to DIY a home listing.- some homeowners don&#x27;t want to deal directly with potential buyers (pre-qualify buyer&#x27;s bank financials, show them around the property, etc). Some homeowners are uncomfortable wearing a \"salesmen\" hat.- some homeowners are not savvy about how to present and market their home. Sure there are endless books and youtube videos on jazzing up \"curb appeal\" but some people simply want a \"professional\" to advise them.- some homeowners feel uncomfortable with legal aspects and even hiring an attorney specializing in real estate feels \"weird\". It&#x27;s just more \"normal and easier\" to use a real estate agent.Analogous situation in people selling things on ebay. What&#x27;s the value in a service like iSoldIt[1] charging a commission for ebaying on sellers behalf when the seller can save money by DIY by taking own photos, using ebay website to upload the photos and list the item, and then pack & ship the item themselves?!? The value is that some people don&#x27;t want to DIY certain tasks. I had a friend sell his camera via iSoldIt. I sell stuff myself on ebay all the time and thought he was crazy for paying the iSoldIt commission. He was a young programmer so he&#x27;s not an old grandfather that would find ebay&#x27;s website intimidating. He simply didn&#x27;t want to deal with the whole ebay workflow and wanted some cash as quickly as possible. Consider that ebaying a camera is way simpler than selling a house and yet some still offload it to a service to handle it for them.EDIT to replies:>, but I don&#x27;t think most people would be willing to spend 12k just to be more comfortable,>Agents provide value.

People are already aware of \"selling by owner\"; they just don&#x27;t want to do it and would rather pay a commission.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.i-soldit.com&#x2F;how-it-works&#x2F; reply ssharp 19 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s a puzzle to you because you had the personality & motivation to do the work of marketing+showing+negotiating the house yourself. You have inadvertently projected your DIY savvy onto other homeowners to do the same thing. But, a lot of home sellers don&#x27;t want to DIY a home listing.I might have implied I did much of this work. I didn&#x27;t, outside of negotiating. The marketing is simply getting the house on real estate sites and in-front of buyer agents, which is what MLS self-listing services do for you for a flat rate. The showings were still handled by the buyer agents. The only thing I had to do was represent myself in negotiations, which was not that difficult.Understood that some may want to do that, but the price difference is insane. If you save 4.5% (assuming buyer agent gets the 1.5% difference from 6%) on a $400k house, that&#x27;s $18,000.Regarding FSBO, this is where MLS self-listing plays a huge role. I tried selling my house for a few months by listing on Zillow (assuming Zillow is way more popular a decade later, but still) and sticking a sign in my front-yard. MLS gets you on every real estate site and at the fingertips of buying agents.Lastly, as you say in your replies, the issue is justification of the 6%. There are lots of issues here -- super expensive, there is already a very serious principle-agent issue incentive misalignment, and the value is questionable. When housing prices skyrocketed, did their value skyrocket in tandem? reply PaulDavisThe1st 18 hours agorootparentAnecdata to be sure, but I successfully FSBO-sold 2 houses in the Phila. area using Zillow only (no MLS listing).

And if the update is just a remodel (such as new flooring and tile in your bathroom, or new cabinets&#x2F;countertops in your kitchen), there is no reassessement.Example: a house was purchased 30 years ago for $200K, so that is the base year value (goes up 2% per year per Prop 13).

Our agent found the listing through word of mouth before it went on MLS, and got us lined up for an early tour so we had the chance to look at it before the open house. We liked it enough to get a pre-inspection on his advice (The market is too hot here for inspection contingencies, which is insane on a 100 year old house!). By the time the open house ended we had seen it twice and walked through with an inspector, which made us confident enough to bid.The agent talked to the seller&#x27;s agent at length and figured out what was most important to them (close time over raw cash, because they were carrying two mortgages), and it turned out that the seller&#x27;s agent knew our mortgage broker (who our agent originally referred us to) and trusted how fast he worked.We ended up beating over a dozen other offers, some of which were substantially higher. There&#x27;s zero chance we&#x27;d have gotten this house (or anything competitive in DC) without a good agent, unless we were already in the industry and hyper connected, or bidding well into the six figures over ask.We looked at many places, and bid on two other houses we didn&#x27;t win (post-covid market), so per hour he probably didn&#x27;t make a crazy high salary, though in line with a good salesperson or manager.When we sold our old place, he helped advise us on pricing, set us up with good options for staging, arranged the floor plan maker and photographer, etc etc. For 3% of the sales fee I certainly could&#x27;ve done all that myself, but I know people who would&#x27;ve never gotten all that organized while also moving. We barely did even with the help!Now all that said, your median realtor in America just forwarding MLS listings and lockbox codes is probably not earning their share, but in competitive markets I think realtors can make a lot of sense. reply schnable 17 hours agoparentWe bought three houses and sold two through the same agent. The first few transactions were pretty straightforward so he really just acted as a coach. Probably not worth the 6%.In our latest sell&#x2F;buy, the house were selling had a significant unaddressed issue and the house we were buying had easement issues and a hard to work with seller&#x2F;agent. His experience was crucial in getting it all over the finish line, we would never have been able to do it successfully ourselves and I would say he earned his money. reply judge2020 18 hours agoparentprevThe pro tip is to become an agent yourself. You&#x27;ll have to become active with a broker whenever you want to buy, which is 50-100&#x2F;month in fees, but then you&#x27;ll get the \"buyer&#x27;s agent\" 3% at closing (or after closing, depending on how the brokers negotiate payment). reply underseacables 20 hours agoprevI think something that is partly to blame is the expansive licensure scheme, and how those licenses have become a monopolistic edge to protect and expand. Many professions have required a license, and it is the responsibility of the organization that issue those license to protect an expand their authority, preventing competition, and pushing up prices higher.The license requirement creates a perpetuating lobby, which I think is partly to blame for real estate agent commission issue.Do we really need to enshrine into law every professions market corner? A certification law would do just as well, but it would not have the effect of blocking competition, preventing market, disruption, and forcing people who want to practice that particular profession to constantly pay a private association for the right to be licensed. reply DennisP 19 hours agoparentA real estate license mostly teaches what you need to know about the laws around real estate transactions. It&#x27;s pretty easy to get. Take the courses, pass the test, and you&#x27;re in, there&#x27;s no restricted access. You can set up your own brokerage and everything.But if you want your brokerage to have access to the MLS system, you have to join the Realtor organization. That&#x27;s where the monopolistic behavior creeps in. reply poulsbohemian 13 hours agorootparentYour location may be different, but what you are describing is not universal or even common in my experience working in multiple states. Yes, it is absolutely true that there should be a higher barrier to entry and even after \"first renewal\" (which is normally a second round of education), there isn&#x27;t enough training before we let new agents loose into the world. That said - in every state I&#x27;m aware of, you work under a licensed broker who has additional licensing, training, and legal responsibility. Until you&#x27;ve reached that level of licensing it is not possible to set up your own brokerage. I&#x27;ve seen a work around where a non-licensed business owner paid someone to be their broker, but that regardless there has to be someone with the right licensing running the business.Also - whether MLS members must also be Realtors is a rule of the MLS and not a universal requirement. The NAR, nor MLSs, do not set commissions. In fact, much of the MLS rule changes in recent years that I&#x27;ve observed have been about making sure non-Realtor licensees have market access. It&#x27;s right there in our paperwork that I show clients where we ask permission so that the seller knows who will be entering their home. reply judge2020 18 hours agorootparentprevMost states require some years of experience before you can become an independent broker, in Florida it&#x27;s 2 years of active work &#x2F; 5 years in the system. reply philips 19 hours agorootparentprevExcept in Oregon you also have to have a minimum number of transactions per year or have a “senior broker” sign off on all your deals (for a price). reply jjoonathan 19 hours agoparentprevWe should always have several competing licensing bodies.1 licensing body: never considers the cost of gatekeeping, only the self-benefit.2 licensing bodies: they are forced to weigh the cost of gatekeeping against the self-benefit, but you might get a race to the bottom.3 licensing bodies: they are forced to weigh the cost of gatekeeping against the self-benefit, and if they race to the bottom too hard we can decertify one and retain competition until we can bud off a replacement. reply Tangurena2 20 hours agoparentprevOccupational licensing was originally developed to prevent black people from being employed.

My wife reminds me of this--she grew up in rural Idaho, where many things I take for granted (e.g. electricians, medical care) growing up in the Chicago suburbs, weren&#x27;t available.Let&#x27;s consider the choices of a homeowner in this market, who needs electrical work done: (a) pay a licensed professional to travel into their market (expensive), (b) have someone unlicensed do the work (or DIY it), or (c) just don&#x27;t do it.This is why I think certification (not mandatory licensing) is the way to go.

As a buyer you will spend thousands on legal and survey fees before you even know if there is anything wrong with the property.Legal fees are more like 2k+ these days (source: buying a house) reply ck425 19 hours agorootparentIn England you mean. I&#x27;m not sure about Wales or NI but the system in Scotland is much better and still has similarly low fee&#x27;s.In Scotland sellers are legally required to provide a survey to potential buyer, known as the Home Report, which covers all the basics. While it doesn&#x27;t go indepth on specific issues it does normally highlight them in the first place so you&#x27;re far less likely to uncover surprise issues after buying. And if it does find potentially major issues the seller will often pay for a more indepth survey or to just get it fixed themselves as otherwise no one will consider the property. For example the home report for the first property I bought found damp which put most people off so the seller paid for a damp survey and quote to fix which they added to the HR. Even then it put a lot of people off and I got it £3k under valuation despite the quote to fix the damp being only £1.8k.Also I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the same down in England but \"estate agents\" in Scotland are all solicitors and thus regulated. Plus when you sell it&#x27;s one fee to one company for everything and there&#x27;s no faff about info going between agents and solicitors. reply harel 18 hours agorootparentprevI hear complaints about it a lot, and I&#x27;ve nearly been burned by that system myself. However, it protects the people in the chain from becoming homeless or obligated to a sale if their buyer&#x2F;seller falls through for example. reply rwmj 20 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s important to note that (in general) sellers pay the estate agents fee and buyers pay stamp duty. If you are both buying and selling then you&#x27;d pay both, but on different properties. However if you&#x27;re moving to&#x2F;from rentals, dead or moving abroad then you&#x27;d pay only one.Also it&#x27;s possible to cut out the estate agent if you really want to save money. There are a bunch of websites that for a minimal flat fee will let you DIY it, but be prepared to make your own for sale sign, photograph your own property, and show prospective buyers around. reply _benedict 20 hours agorootparentThose websites usually include (or at least offer) professional photography, and some also offer various levels of agent assistance for viewings, negotiations etc. an a la carte offering of sorts. A for sale sign is often included as it’s free advertising for them. reply mytailorisrich 19 hours agorootparentprevWell the estate agent is the agent (i.e. employee) of the seller: They work for the seller. It&#x27;s quite normal that they are paid by the party who employs them! reply onlyrealcuzzo 20 hours agoparentprevWhy is the notary making 2%?!Is that including all legal fees?Even still that seems like a much bigger rip off than a buyer&#x27;s agent in the US. reply hef19898 20 hours agorootparentA nortary makes sure the sale ia properly exevuted and titles properly transferred, he is certifying the transaction and takes on some legal riks dor doing so.

For all others, it is just coat of doing business.No idea why it is always everybody else who should work for free. reply tecleandor 20 hours agorootparentSounds more like a lawyer or several competencies at the same time.In Spain the notary \"just\" works through the signature of the contract: - Checks the identities of the parties and their legal status - Makes \"sure\" both parties understand the contract - Verifies that the property can be sold (checks for legal issues in the national registry) - Serves as a legal witness to the signature - Sends a copy of the contract to the national registry (but AFAIK, doesn&#x27;t follow up)The cost here, for that, is around 500-800€. It&#x27;s regulated by law.Then you have to contact a registrar to make all the legal papers to make all the legal papers in the national registry. That&#x27;s araound 300-400 €, I think. reply PaulDavisThe1st 18 hours agorootparentIn the US, this can be done by a title & escrow service.

E.g. you just fill a form in a government services website and get a PDF back? reply esrauch 20 hours agorootparentprevDoes the notary provide the title insurance (as in: if it turns out later that the seller didn&#x27;t actually own the house, the real owner shows up and proves it, the bank and new buyers have their money covered)?That would make more sense for the 2% but it&#x27;s not related to the notary in the US; notary literally just does \"I checked the id of the person signing and it matches\" which is a service that can be had for free at your bank or at most $50 if you have to pay someone, 2% of a house for that service obviously wouldn&#x27;t make sense. reply hef19898 20 hours agorootparentIn Germany you cannot sell real estate thatbisn&#x27;t yours, ownership is registered. The notary, as part of his job, makes sure this title transfer is done properly. If the seller isn&#x27;t the owner, the sale is void, as far as I know sales price is to be paid once the title transfer was requested and approved, upon proof of payment the notary finalizes it. So basically no title insurance needed.By the way, excerpts of the registry for the real estate in question are part of the sales contract (just remembered). reply esrauch 19 hours agorootparentOwnership is registered in the US and part of the sale is a \"title search\" to check that and then update the registered title when the sale is executed (both handled by an attorney).The case of title insurance is only where something weirder happens with wills, contracts, or liens. If there was an owner that died in 2016 and his will said \"split my house to all surviving children\". And at the time one child shows up who believes they are the sole surviving descendant and claims the house and sells it in 2017, then 2018 a second heir finds out their estranged parent died and shows up to say \"actually half of this house was mine, that guy didn&#x27;t legally have the right to sell it even without any fraud occuring\".Title insurance ends up &#x27;fixing&#x27; this problem so that the buyer and actual-should-have-been-owner can both be made whole (and they go after the seller for the amount they didn&#x27;t actually own, but sometimes that won&#x27;t be possible to recover). If you don&#x27;t have title insurance you as the buyer just take the liability that you might not actually own the house (or part of the house) if the record was mistaken and needs to be corrected.In Germany would this just be a case where if the will is executed and you find out too late the inheritor would be screwed with no way to get what you owned instead? reply dagw 20 hours agorootparentprevA notary in the UK is a type of lawyer (although not necessarily a solicitor) and requires special certification and training.

    "originBody": "Thank you all so much! The original post got such a great response it would be rude not to tell you more about the project. I hacked the Magic Mouse. And created the world's first ergonomic Magic Mouse with no weaknesses. Yes, you can charge it via USB-C right while you're working! More details + demo in the thread pic.twitter.com/lxvCXArZdG — Ivan Kuleshov (@Merocle) November 16, 2023 Some media coverage appleinsider.com tomshardware.com gizmodo.com creativebloq.com First of all This may be a little intrusive, but I’d appreciate it if you’d join our Discord server, and subscribe to my Instagram and/or X (Twitter). It will be the best “thanks” if you liked the article 🙂 Thank you, and May the Force be with you! How I came up with the idea. Yes, I know that the mouse is quite questionable in terms of convenience, but the main driver of my idea was these two clips. Some time ago, I saw this video and immediately thought of what I needed to do to solve the author’s problem: A year later, I saw this video and decided my time had come: The idea It became obvious to me that I should just charge the battery and do not to connect mouse schematics, well as it turns out it worked. Not without some interesting findings, though. To make it ergonomic and prevent problems with the sensor (which is not working perfectly as it is) I will have to divide the mouse into 2 halves. I was prepared to have to lengthen the cable from the top part (touch sensor), but luckily, the standard length turned out to be enough. Implementation The found models did not fit at all. I had to do it myself, and the first attempts were quite …. ugly, what can I say? Moreover, all the Magic Mouse 3d models I’ve found aren’t perfect either. So, I adjusted the shape of the enclosure step by step, just by eye. It’s a concept, after all 🙂 Create-> print -> Adjust -> print -> Adjust -> print -> etc… A last, but probably not the final option. After all, there is no limit to perfection. But if I were to perfect it, I’m afraid the project would never see the light of day In the photo, you can notice a frame-adapter for the upper part of the mouse. It was made in only four iterations drawn “by eye with a caliper” Its task is essentially to repeat and extend the original mount (which, by the way, is quite difficult to disassemble without breaking anything off). There is also a place for a spring (a long metal part near the button) and an offset lever that presses the button. I was so confident of success that I didn’t even bother to see if the charging idea would work. Better late than never. The labeling on the battery is not standard (3.61V), but according to the tests, it is a normal one cell that can be charged to 4.2V, which is defined as 100% in the OS. Easy to open 4.03V is about 80% in the OS My interesting find, for the careful reader When I charge the battery using my BMC (TP4056) the mouse is not aware that it is in the process of charging. The TP4056 raises the voltage to ~4.258V when the charge is complete. And then shuts down, and the battery stays at ~4.2V. So here’s the finding: If we monitor the percentage of charge in the OS, we see 100% at 4.15, and then the wonders begin. At ~4.17V, the percentage drops to 99%. ~4.19V – 98% ~4.21V – 97% ~4.24V – 96% After charging is finished and I restarted the mouse, the percentage is back to 100%. Maybe I’ve found why the mouse is magical? 🙂 Next, I soldered a regular TP4056 directly to the battery outputs. Don’t have to make it complicated. With this battery capacity, it will do the job just fine, there is no need for additional current limiters. Just in case, I monitored the temperature while charging, and everything seemed to be working great. The boring soldering of a few wires People say you have to be very careful when working with batteries! Do not overheat, open, or short-circuit them. Wear goggles and have fire extinguishers handy. Trained professionals perform these stunts. Proof of concept. Charging demo The mouse continues to work while charging. The system doesn’t track that it’s charging, but the battery percentage just goes up. Just as I’d hoped Assembling As in most advanced devices, I used double-sided tape to glue the battery on. However, double-sided tape was mostly used for assembly as well. By the way, for the first time, I tried printing on an FDM printer at 60 microns (0.06mm) resolution. I installed this adapter into the top of the mouse and taped it to the battery so it could be disassembled for fine-tuning. Once the exact position has been selected, it makes sense to glue it firmly in place and snap the top part into place. Trying on A short video about the top-part extension adapter Just trying it on and showing how the click works. I apologize for the noise of the printers in the background. And then there’s the final view. I added high-tech hot glue (sarcasm) to secure the wires and USB-C port. If it works, why think of anything else? Carefully connected the FFC cable and secured it with the native fasteners. I added double-sided tape to the plastic extension adapter and simply taped it to the battery at the very end. Final demo That’s it. Sources repository in progress One more thing When I started working on the project, I immediately had very global plans. Namely: Add RGB backlighting. Add a Raspberry Pi RP2040 with an accelerometer to activate the backlighting. Consider installing additional buttons connecting RP2040 to the Macbook with a separate BT channel or cable. Install an additional battery to ensure the operation of the backlighting. Fortunately, I came to my senses in time. But you know, sometimes it’s so hard to stop yourself.

Then you&#x27;ll find the scrolling experience with the Magic Mouse is even better than one with a traditional mouse or a trackpad because you can speed-scroll with any finger, at any angle, and with minimal frictions.

I can&#x27;t prove it, but I blame a decade of Magic Mouse use for my very painful RSI, which I now have the pleasure of experiencing using any mouse at all.Apple&#x27;s input devices are beautiful, but they totally blow comfort. It&#x27;s as if their industrial designers are all in their early 20s and have never experienced joint pain. reply jahewson 3 hours agoparentI suspect you’re right. I very much enjoyed the Magic Mouse but had similar issues with wrist discomfort. The neutral position of the human wrist is vertical - thumb pointing up as if shaking hands with someone. The Magic Mouse is so low-profile that it forces the wrist into an almost 90deg rotation. Ergonomically, it’s highly problematic.The solution for me was to switch to a vertical mouse (well, almost) that allows the wrist to remain neutral. Because I missed the gestures I added a Magic Trackpad on the left side of my keyboard. Of course this suffers from the same ergonomic problem but I only reach for it sporadically so the impact is minimal. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentTried the vertical mouse, but no help. My wrist seems to be permanently fucked. I use a trackpad 100% now, no problems. reply Epa095 2 hours agorootparentMy 2 cents: I had rsi, then I started bouldering. At first I got more pain.

The Mighty Mouse (Wireless) was the perfect one.I tried one of those Magic Mouse “enhancements” (2009-2010) -- a white silicon contraption -- that sits atop the mouse. It was handy, and I used it for a while. I eventually got used to the mouse in its form and stopped trying any modifications.I have tried the Master Series from Logitech, and I like them but don’t use all the functions. I like the simplicity of the Magic Mouse.Charging - I do it once in 45 days, or when it complains — leave it charged -- have tea, walk&#x2F;run, or read. Charging was never a problem, and I believe everyone else making a lot of noise about the charging is just overblowing it. If you remember to leave it charged overnight, it needs no charging for the next month or so.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdn.oinam.com&#x2F;img&#x2F;oinam&#x2F;brajeshwar-apple-mighty-mous... reply giobox 6 hours agoparentThe Mighty Mouse size was nice, but not sure it was worth the constant hassle of cleaning the tiny track ball of whatever microscopic dust mote blocked it from working again and again - every single Mighty Mouse I ever owned would regularly jam up and be a pain to unjam. No other mouse I&#x27;ve ever owned or abused has had a button or wheel stop working, ever.I do miss the distinctive \"click\" Apple mice of this era made a lot though. reply jonhohle 6 hours agoparentprevThe Mighty Mouse is almost the perfect mouse, IMHO. Its two flaws are 1) (as the sibling comment pointed out) how the scroll ball accumulates junk and is impossible to clean without cutting open the mouse and the implementation of the side buttons.Having a first party Apple mouse with real middle click support is awesome. The multi direction scrolling has become a mandatory mouse feature for me. The size and weight are fantastic. For those that have used it, and don’t know, the nearly haptic tic while scrolling is an internal speaker which provides great feedback (especially when the rollers get stuck and the clicking stops so you known it’s time to clean the ball).I find the Magic Mouse uncomfortable, it has no native middle click, no side buttons. Its best feature is that it fixed the scroll ball.I finally broke down and bought a new, old stock Mighty Mouse a few months ago. The scroll ball feels so smooth. reply Retr0id 5 hours agoprevI think there&#x27;s already a solution: flat-flex QI charging pads, like this one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mobilefun.co.uk&#x2F;iphone-lightning-qi-universal-wi...I don&#x27;t endorse that particular listing, it was just the first one in my search results.

Comparable ultrabooks to the MacBook Pro (Dell XPS line, ThinkPad X1) aren’t massively far off, and they’re made of plastic, not aluminum, which makes a difference in durability in my experience.

One big design goal was to build something omegle-like that I&#x27;d be a little more comfortable using (thus there&#x27;s no audio, no text chat, video is limited to faces, video cuts if it can&#x27;t find a face, if you don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s on screen close your eyes and it disappears, etc). But I started before omegle shut down - the timing was surprisingly (and of course the shut down is sad).The site is also intentionally set up to not feel too gamey; I think some folks experience this as \"staring contest\" and others as \"weird art about missed connections\" and I&#x27;d like it to be open to both (so, no leaderboards). I think it&#x27;d be really cool to set up some physical devices that are all hooked up to an instance of this site.Anyway, I blogged a little bit more about the site at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;eieio.games&#x2F;nonsense&#x2F;game-12-stranger-video&#x2F;. Happy to answer questions here ofc. reply w10-1 15 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a great idea. It pretty directly re-humanizes the web.Some marketing to consider...Both \"staring\" and \"strangers\" gives it a disconcerting vibe, amplified by the dark background and the naked request to enable the webcam.What about \"See someone\" or \"See someone seeing you\" or \"See someone seeing you for a second\", with a blue sky to start?Then instead of emphasizing staring, just say something like \"blink to leave\".Thus: \"The webcam will show only your face, and then you will see someone seeing you. Blink to leave.\"Also, in the detailed explanation, you might add that it is peer-to-peer, and no images are captured or stored anywhere else.The \"buy me coffee\" link makes the site seem... incentivized, I guess. If you instead add that prompt to the information panel about you, I think you would still capture the appreciative few without putting off the many now triggered by pervasive tipping (kind of like early google text ads vs yahoo banner ads). reply eieio 14 hours agorootparentThanks for the feedback!

Definitely feels like an intersection of art and programming. Not a lot of websites I pull up make me feel like I am connecting with an actual person staring back at me, however brief. Quite likely because, well, they&#x27;re not. Written words are a kind of connection, one way video is a kind of connection, but two way is it&#x27;s own whole thing obviously and a type of feeling that is novel in my web browsing. I know chatroulette and omegle did it first, but still the feeling is so outside of the norm of using the internet that it feels novel.I think you definitely captured some of the intimidating vibe that unbroken direct eye contact with a stranger can create. It was very fun though. I enjoyed seeing people&#x27;s facial expressions go from neutral while staring at their own face, to lighting up once they are looking directly at another person who is also trying to not blink. The eyebrow wiggles or nose contortions people pulled in order to emote while not blinking was also very fun.I was beaming a huge smile back at folks, and eventually used a sticky note to write !iH and put it on my nose. Definitely got some reactions from that haha.Yes, some folks are using a virtual webcam to just show a static stock image of a person&#x27;s face (cowards!). But I got some unique real humans.The disconnect is really quick, and felt like maybe there&#x27;s some bugs. In terms of, folks would frequently disconnect quickly. I don&#x27;t think I ever SAW anyone blink, so likely the stream is cut off immediately and the blinking frames aren&#x27;t sent? I&#x27;d love to be able to see someone blink in this before they go away. Even a freeze frame of that would be nice. Grounding them going away with the human expression of blinking would help keep me in the experience, cutting away without seeing the action that caused them to \"lose\" breaks the experience for me.Very cool project though! I&#x27;m not sure how often I&#x27;ve written code that makes a human _feel something human_ that isn&#x27;t frustration haha. reply eieio 16 hours agorootparentA friend last night floated a similar idea re: cutting off too fast - it&#x27;d be great to get sent a slo-mo of them blinking. I think you&#x27;re totally right that it cuts too quickly and would gain a lot there.In general I am very very quick to cut and I think that contributes both to the experience feeling worse and to some of the bugs (there are definitely bugs!). The blink detection is also super finicky - blinks are just really fast, and if I dial down the sensitivity it&#x27;s super easy to miss obvious blinks entirely.I&#x27;m glad this is resonating with some folks though. I wasn&#x27;t sure before building it if it would, and this gives me a reason to iterate on and improve it :) reply jonchurch_ 16 hours agorootparentThe knowledge that I can end a given session by closing my eyes feels very good and natural. It also gives it a bit of a \"game\" type of experience.But I&#x27;d encourage you to think about the experience you&#x27;re trying to create, in terms of how to handle the sensitivity of blinking for ending a session. With a single blink being the end, then it becomes very easy to accidentally end a session (either via a bug in false positives, or of course just doing the human thing of blinking).If you want to maximize time spent staring into a human&#x27;s eyes without looking away, then the session could end after say 1-2 seconds of eyes being closed, or looking off screen. Then the choice to leave is a bit more intentional, and so sessions can last longer for folks who really want to see how long they can stare at a stranger without tapping out. reply trompe-le-monde 16 hours agoparentprevThe video feed showing the stranger&#x27;s face doesn&#x27;t seem to be working, but the inputs taken from my own camera (blinks) do.

Well done! reply javier_e06 16 hours agoprevWe spend half our lives trying to find that place where the demons are few and apart. Enabling the camera?

I guess the problem could be that I&#x27;m in Europe, so if all 3-9 strangers (that&#x27;s the range of people staring during my waiting period) are in USA the ping is high so the system won&#x27;t connect us.Sounds interesting! reply jelicicm 14 hours agoparentNow got 4x in a row: stranger lost video. reply testmasterflex 15 hours agoprevDidn’t work :( wouldn’t connect to stranger reply simonblack 9 hours agoprevDepends on how long you are allowed to do the staring.Its very commonly said that if you stare into another person&#x27;s eyes for thirty seconds, you&#x27;ll either fight or fuck. reply mbfg 15 hours agoprevFirst thing i thought of was thishttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=XJ5zx__Iavshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1EumnijQBhw reply givemeethekeys 10 hours agoprevNice thing about going to a bar is, you can stare into the eyes of a stranger, and even get to know them if you both like what the other sees. reply pupperino 3 hours agoprevI can only see my own video :( reply potatoman22 13 hours agoprevDoes the connection close if you blink even once? Or if the algorithm can&#x27;t find your face once? I was barely able to see anyone b&#x2F;c of stuff that seems like this. reply sterlind 14 hours agoprevIt gets stuck forever on \"connecting to stranger...\" even though the \"# strangers watching\" text keeps updating. Is it down?Looks really cool btw. reply bigyihsuan 13 hours agoprevMy eyes are half-closed in their relaxed state, and it&#x27;s funny how my eyes are open and the site thinks I&#x27;m blinking. reply jimbooonooo 16 hours agoprevNone of the other video appeared to be live, is that intentional? reply eieio 16 hours agoparentthis is definitely not intentional and is probably some combination of me doing a bad job of setting up webrtc, people having spotty internet, and people messing with the site. reply Mizza 10 hours agoprevI made a game in a similar style:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;internetfight.club&#x2F;State your hot take, then yell back and forth with a stranger until one of you rage quits. reply Minor49er 10 hours agoparentI got paired with an opponent who didn&#x27;t respond at all, but I had a blast reply TheRealHB 16 hours agoprevNot working for when I tried.I wonder if I print a set of open eyes and test your game....

Would I win or get banned?Jokes aside, eager to test ; ) reply eieio 16 hours agoparentI definitely don&#x27;t want to make you do any work, but if you keep having problems i&#x27;m happy to debug your setup with you (just email eieiogames@gmail.com) for as long as you have patience!in my experience the face detection is relatively good but the eye detection is still a little spotty &#x2F; could be tweaked[1]. Although within reason that&#x27;s just part of the fun.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;thecpe&#x2F;status&#x2F;1725553399981044165 reply TheRealHB 16 hours agorootparentLooks fun, thanks for the X ref.

Presumably we made up nearly all the users for the site today. reply coding123 13 hours agoparentprevI think I would do it if it guaranteed a gender. It would give you that fall in love feeling potentially. reply dmd 13 hours agorootparentI was commenting on how this sort of thing is a sausagefest.
