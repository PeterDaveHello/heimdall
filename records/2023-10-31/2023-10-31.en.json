    "originBody": "Ludicity I Accidentally Saved Half A Million Dollars Published on October 29, 2023 I saved my company half a million dollars in about five minutes. This is more money than I've made for my employers over the course of my entire career because this industry is a sham. I clicked about five buttons. Let's talk about why happened and why it's a disgrace that it was even possible. I. Background Let's start with some background, because it is fucking wild that an inefficiency that took me five minutes to solve in a GUI configuration panel was allowed to persist. We cancelled someone's contract the week before I did this. Someone lost their job because no one could get their act together long enough to click the button I told them to click. A few years ago, this company decided that it wanted to create an analytics platform, following the decision to become more \"data driven\". They hired some incredibly talented people to make this happen, and then like five times as many idiots. At the time this was happening, I had just graduated and joined the organization as a data scientist. We, of course, did not do any data science, because the organization did not require any data science to be done - what they actually needed to do was fire most of the staff in every team, leaving behind the two people who actually had good domain knowledge, then allow them to collaborate with good engineering teams to build sensible processes and systems. Instead, they hired a bunch of Big Firm Consultants. You can see where this is going already. Nonetheless, at the time I was young and took the organization at its word. Executives would tell us constantly how excited they were for us to roll out new A.I initiatives (then tell us there was no time, so could we please get that report to them in a spreadsheet), and I'd ask for some sort of compute to perform some machine learning, or even set up data pipelines. It never worked. Instead, we were told that we just had to wait for the Advanced Analytics Platform (AAP) to be deployed. You see, it's December, and it's launching in January. Then in January I was told to be patient, it was coming in March. In June, I was told it had been put on hold due to Covid - this was a very convenient excuse because they had absolutely fucked the whole project up already, but it bought some valuable time. By the next December, I had left the organization and the AAP was still nowhere to be seen. We skip ahead three years. The AAP is finally ready to launch. It turns out none of the features I needed were ever planned, so I guess they were just lying to me before I left. Four engineers leave the company in the same week, and I speak with the directors because I know they need a real engineer in and they can't find them. I'm a substantially less experienced engineer than many of the readers here, but suffice it to say that I can read documentation without panicking, which is considered S-tier in this country. My conditions - a big pile of money and they had to put me on the AAP team because they're the only team that gets actual toys to play with. II. It Fucking Sucks It's an insane dumpster fire spiderweb of technical debt and it's only like one week old. Here are some fun details. I get a friend of mine hired (big fan of nepotism), and he finds, on day one, a file in the project's repository that deletes prod using our CI/CD pipelines if it is ever moved into the wrong folder. It comes complete with the key and password required for an admin account. It was produced by the former lead engineer, who has moved on to a new role before his sins catch up with him. The entire thing is stitched together by spreadsheets that are parsed by Python, dropped into S3, parsed by Lambdas into more S3, the S3 files are picked up by MongoDB, then MongoDB records are passed by another Lambda into S3, the S3 files are pulled into Snowflake via Snowpipe, the new Snowflake data is pivoted by a Javascript stored procedure into a relational format... and that's how you edit someone's database access. That whole process is to upload like a 2KB CSV to a database that has people's database roles in it. This is considered more auditable. Everything is transformed into a CSV because the security team demanded something that could undergo easy scanning for malicious content, then they never deployed the scanning tool, so we have all the downsides of the CSVs and none of the upsides. Every Lambda function, the backbone of all the ETL pipelines, starts with counter = 1 because one of the early iterations used to use a counter and people have just been copying that line over and over. Senior data engineers have been copying that line over and over. The test suites in the CI/CD pipelines have been failing for months, because someone during debugging chose to use the Linux tee command to log any errors to both stdout and a file at the same time, but tee successfully executing was overwriting the error code from the failing tests. To get access to the password for any API we need to hit, you search for something like service-password in an AWS service, which returns the value... service-password (as in, literally all the values are the same as the keys), then you use that to look up the actual password in a completely different service. No one knows why we do this. The script that generates configuration files for our pipelines starts with 600 lines of comments, because senior engineers have been commenting the lines out in case they're needed later. The lines are just setting the same variables to different values, and they're all on GitHub anyway. This is at an organization that some percentage of readers will recognize on sheer brand strength if they're in my country. I'm not even getting started, but we have to stop for now because I am going to catch fire. These details are important because now you understand the kind of operational incompetence that allows you to waste so much money on processing <1TB of data per day that it dwarfs your team's salary. III. The Budget The next thing to realize is that this platform never really had a chance of making any money for the organization. They do a little accounting trick (read: lying) which I'll talk about in another post that makes it seem like they've had huge wins, but really this is just many times more expensive than our previous operational model. The deal is that we pretend the whole team is doing something or other, and we stay within budget because the organization can't afford to spend infinite money on this social fiction. However, the budget for our database costs was being drastically overrun. I'm not sure what the original estimate was, but I think it was intended to cost something like 200K for a year of operations, but we were now close to a million dollars. Some quick facts: We use Snowflake as our database, which charges you based on the size of the computer you use to run your queries. You only pay for computers while they're on. We probably run a few thousand queries per week, mostly developers experimenting with little tweaks for PowerBI reports that no one reads, and on average they take about 2 seconds to run. The computers are set to idle for 10 minutes after every query. I noticed this about a month into joining the team, and suggested we uh... don't have the computers run for like two orders of magnitude longer than they need to for every query. I literally can't remember what was said, there was some Agile bullshit about doing a discovery piece, then it just never happened. IV. Just Doing The Fucking Thing Anyway, months later, they finally give me a card that says \"Discovery: Optimise Costs\". Now I have to optimize costs so that I have something to say at the next standup, and fortunately I know just the thing! I'll test my hypothesis that this is all a sick joke, and I'm going to push the button that I secretly think should obviously have been pushed. We've got a new guy on another team who seems excellent, so I ask management if I can give him admin credentials since we need competent people. They say no. I flick him some lower-level database credentials that I technically wasn't told not to do since they aren't admin credentials, and he sanity-checks that it would save money. At 4PM on the last day of the week, I ping a chat full of good engineers and no managers to make sure I'm not about to nuke everything, then just do it. V. Chaos Reigns I return to work the following Monday. I suspected that this would save a bunch of money, and guess what, our projected bill dropped from a million to half a million dollars, and everyone is losing their fucking minds. My team has spun this as a huge cost saving, when really we just applied a fire extinguisher to the pile of money that we had set alight. Other teams are attacking my team, insisting that it can't be a coincidence that the one new guy joined exactly as we did this, and how was it possible we didn't know how to generate that kind of saving without his help? They are saying this because it makes them seem higher status and their teams only produce money in the land where you lie all day, but it is a fair question. While my managers are very happy, they quietly suggest it may be unwise to roll out the changes to all the computers (I only did a few to be safe) because it would oversaturate the department to hear about us all day. And invite unwelcome questions. The subtext is that if we do this all slowly enough, it might seem like it took a lot of effort instead of just clicking buttons that I said had to be clicked almost a year ago. I am asked to write some PowerPoints, which include phrases like \"a careful statistical analysis of user usage patterns indicated an opportunity to more effectively allocate resources\", implying that nothing was wrong, we just needed to collect more data before deciding not to let the expensive machines idle all day. Every day, I dread someone asking me to explain what the change was, because I will have to fucking yeet some managers I like under a bus, but they can't resist talking about the change non-stop because it is the closest some of them will ever get to impacting the bottom line. And many of them are actually decent managers, it's just that this whole department, like many departments, is some sort of weird political PsyOp to get executives promoted. It's cosplaying as a real business and the board thinks the costume is convincing. VI. The Aftermaths and Takeaways By identifying a handful of good engineers and going totally rogue, we outperformed the entire department pretty effortlessly. The competent people are there, just made totally impotent by the organization, and I'm still convinced that this place is probably better than the median organization. I ask management for a 30K raise after saving 500K and my message is still unread. I suspect I will eventually receive either nothing or 5K. I have even more meetings now because everyone wants to talk about how we saved the money. I had to make a PowerPoint. Kill me. I would have been better off not doing anything. Let that be a lesson to you. Do you hear me? I applied myself for five minutes against my own better judgement, had the greatest success of my career, and have immediately been punished for it. Learn from my mistakes, I beg of you. PS: While this is doing immense traffic, any similar stories being sent to ludicity.hackernews@gmail.com would be greatly appreciated so that I feel less alone in this madhouse.

Every time I did something I had to do PowerPoints, present to Flag Officers, etc. Hell, once I almost got hugely punished because I didn&#x27;t let my boss take the credit (he had no desire to because he had zero idea what it was I even did).Note that some of that was as a Lean Six-Sigma Black Belt doing Enterprise projects (I hate every single bit of terminology in that entire godforsaken sentence), where it was literally my JOB to save the DOD as much money as possible with the least disruption possible. Those were the absolute worst years of my career.

The cost of fuel per gallon was around $100 delivered to parts of Afghanistan. They had tons of portable generators running at ~20-40% of capacity. If memory serves, ~70% is most efficient. By some combination of building a small or connecting a few tents to a single generator, they were able to very significantly reduce the fuel required and improve the quality of service. reply pjc50 38 minutes agorootparent> The cost of fuel per gallon was around $100 delivered to parts of AfghanistanThis was one of the most deeply insane parts of the whole twenty-year war. Of course, wars have unlimited budgets, so trucking gasoline thousands of miles through hostile territory with occasional losses and then using it to aircondition tents was going to happen. While back inside the US teachers were having to buy school supplies with their own money, because only wars have unlimited budgets. reply tehlike 18 hours agoparentprevSometimes I think of joining government org (3 letter agency) to find areas to improve $ efficiency on, or make decent direct contribution to US as a thank you for accepting me as an immigrant.I&#x27;m an engineer in a FAANG, who worked directly in money flow, and have had experience in diverse areas where it could come handy.Then I start thinking finding the right person to work with & right area to start at is probably 95% of the job, then give up. reply bigsassy 16 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;d want to start with the United States Digital Service (USDS).

I had too much common sense, and didn&#x27;t make changes just to make changes. I was extremely effective, but since I didn&#x27;t play by the rules I was ostracized internally.That said, it did give me the opportunity to get the hell out of that community and back into IT&#x2F;CyberSec.In all honesty, there are absolutely good concepts and tools in that world. The issue is that the people who gravitate to that world have no ability to provide any value themselves so don&#x27;t actually understand how to USE those tools properly.Everything is a nail when all you have is an ENTIRE TOOLBOX. reply syntaxing 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s interesting because I found Mech design engineers with green belts to usually be really sharp. I only met like one black belt design engineer and he pivoted careers a decade ago. But most black belts I met in QA were managers. Most of the technicians that did the work weren’t certified but lived and breathed the products for decades. reply CobaltFire 17 hours agorootparentMy experience was that the tools are absolutely useful. Green Belts are those who learned the tools, but stayed at their day job. Black Belts are when you pivot into doing it full time.Much like people who underperform in technical fields often pivot to Management, you see the same in the pivot to Process Improvement. That creates the issue of the lowest performers at the actual job being the ones most inclined to pivot into that position.There are always good ones (I&#x27;m biased, but think I was). The issue is that they are a relative rarity due to those (and I&#x27;m sure other) factors. reply beernet 34 minutes agorootparent> Much like people who underperform in technical fields often pivot to ManagementThis can&#x27;t be serious...Not sure if jealousy or just regular hubris. reply syntaxing 17 hours agorootparentprevThe pivot part rings so true, especially “Engineering Services”, aka process and infrastructure control. They often lead the engineering change committee too. I shudder just recalling those meetings. reply busterarm 17 hours agorootparentprevIn that industry it makes sense.

And the greedy fucks would never agree to a rev-share or profit-share, no just here&#x27;s your annual 5% increase now shut the fuck up and do your job.A few jobs ago I was asked to list the names of projects I was actively maintaining for the company, that list stretched out to two entire screens in Excel at default font size!

I listen to their songs. I also have a BirdNetPi doing the same for actual birds too.If my company cocks up it will probably be fatal.

Good ones avoid that and push the credit to where it belongs, but then they don’t promote. This leads to an incentive to take credit from those under you in order to get promoted. reply quacked 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s like a dark-mirror version of a really good principle in leadership philosophy, which was outlined in Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein. \"Everything that happens under your command is your responsibility.\" If a man fails to do his job in the correct way, it&#x27;s because you failed to make a system that would train him properly, and possibly because you allowed the wrong man to be hired. Technically, every success is also your responsibility, but a smart leader spreads blame for success and privatizes blame for failure. In reality many leaders pretty much do the opposite. reply CobaltFire 13 hours agorootparentStarship Troopers is on many recommended military reading lists for career professionals for very good reasons. reply rpmisms 7 hours agorootparentFunctional fascism is a fascinating concept.

It just would have been a career killer. My CO was the one who sent that presentation up with my name front and center. He had to defuse the situation.Also, and this is absolutely relevant, I was not a Commissioned Officer. I retired as a Chief Petty Officer, though I had a degree (Nuclear Engineering) and multiple \"graduate level\" certifications (PMP, LSSBB, CISSP, etc., etc.). There is only so far competence and capability can take you without rank in the US military. I chose to exit rather than move over and promote, which was the right decision for me.I apologize for lacking the context in my previous comments; I often forget people don&#x27;t understand the intricacies of the arcane ways of the military unless they subjected themselves to it. reply unicornmama 18 hours agoparentprev> I&#x27;ll echo the last part of that post: Beware of doing good things at work; the reward is rarely compensation and is usually more work for the same pay.Let’s rephrase this in a less nihilistic way: Understand your organization’s values and culture.

You might think that, if a single person can create or maintain a tool that&#x27;s worth millions of dollars a year to the company, our competitors would do the same thing, just like you might think that if you can ship faster and at a lower cost by hiring a person who knows how to crack a wafer open, our competitors would do that, but they mostly didn&#x27;t. reply pjc50 31 minutes agoparentHave worked in EDA and .. yeah, the software is bad but the buyers are conservative, precisely because it&#x27;s a risky and expensive business.He talks about a \"cocktail party version of the EMH\".

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobras in Delhi, offered a bounty for every dead cobra. Initially, this was a successful strategy; large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, however, enterprising people began to breed cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, the reward program was scrapped. When cobra breeders set their now-worthless snakes free, the wild cobra population further increased.(There may be some question as to whether these events actually occurred or not, but there are similar examples of documented pest-control campaigns (and others) on the Wikipedia page[0] where similar things happened).[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perverse_incentive#The_origina... reply duskwuff 15 hours agorootparentprev> There was an old thedailywtf post about how a company thought they&#x27;d incentivize fidning and fixing bugs.That might have been this Dilbert comic:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;bQOvF.png reply sshine 11 hours agorootparentprevI did save one company enough money to finance my salary for the year I worked there, just by removing dead servers provisioned but no longer used.

Either they became so large that it was impossible to compete against them (as Large Company can demand way better pricing on volume than Small Startup can or has way better access to financial instruments due to better ratings, or like many automotive companies even run their own goddamn bank), or because they could use a wildly profitable business to price-dump competitors out of existence or because they became so large that they felt free to extort their customers to the tune the people would complain about it in the media&#x2F;their congresspeople too much, or because they became so large their sheer size represented too much economic risk (\"too big to fail\").We should begin doing that again.

If we were able to optimize out all the waste we&#x27;d probably have deflation while computers and business processes keep getting more efficient reply Vicinity9635 13 hours agorootparent...no.Inflation is actually very simple: More money is added to the system than value produced. That is, money is printed faster than value is created through labor. Stop and think for a second. How do we have trillions of USD? Banks create money.

Which is why we have inflation, because the increase in the amount of money does not scale with the amount of \"value\". Imagine if government is spending half of the money printed to people staring at walls. This would naturally double the inflation because it requires double the amount of money to produce the same amount of \"value\".So the government is pumping money, but is not getting the desired signal, so it pumps more money. reply digging 16 hours agorootparentprevI mean waste is probably a source of inflation but lots of it just comes from unrestrained profit-seeking behavior.

(It was a weekend near the end of term) I took a look at the system, and realized they had pushed all the compiles into a batch queue, but that queue defaulted to BELOW interactive priority, so any keystroke anywhere had higher priority... so all the people checking their position of the compile job in the queue, slowed it down even more.Over the next 15 minutes, I kept bumping the priority of the top job in the queue up, an hour later everyone had their work done, and went home.

Employees aren&#x27;t unique among economic entities that they face opportunity costs.> it&#x27;s not like hedge fund managers put up the cash themselves, eitherThis is actually a good example to dive into. Hedge funds are typically paid \"2&#x2F;20\", meaning 2% of assets under management every year whether or not there are any gains, and 20% of any gains above some benchmark. It&#x27;s similar to, say, a commission-based sales role that gets paid a certain fixed salary and a percentage of sales they make. Whether or not 2&#x2F;20 is \"fair\" is solely up to those who buy their services, since there is a competitive market of providers of fund management (the \"employee\") and providers of capital (the \"employer\").And in some situations, the \"employers\" do in fact lose a lot of money, while the \"employees\" walk away; the limited partners of Melvin Capital, for example, lost many billions of dollars, all while Melvin Capital itself continued to charge the 2% management fee.And within hedge funds itself, there are again employees who receive a stable salary and maybe some performance-related bonuses on top of that, versus the principals and owners who have personal capital invested.

Having a hard time tracking it down again, anyone remember what that was? reply pavel_lishin 18 hours agorootparentGoogle reveals two things, followed by a bunch of shitty blogspam:- Last year, there was a post on Reddit, with an HN discussion as well: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29994776- In 2017, there was a question about whether someone should tell their employer that they&#x27;ve automated their job: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;workplace.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;93696&#x2F;is-it-un... reply orzig 18 hours agorootparentprevI’ve found LLMs to be good for those sorts of vague “remember that thing like this?” searches. Bing (with GPT) or even Bard with potentially better search integration are both worth a try. reply grvdrm 16 hours agoprevThis post hit right something I dissected in my last role.In short, I was revamping&#x2F;enhancing a property insurance policy pricing system as the lead from the business side (i.e. portfolio manager&#x2F;actuary).However, much of the development team was truly incapable of writing software in any useful way, so I inevitably dipped into C# and SQL to help diagnose issues as we (as a team) worked on the enhancements.My business coworker and I found something that remains funny to this day: code littered with references or attempts to use the .NET TPL library to make the platform do more things \"in parallel,\" but without actual knowledge of using such a library in practice.Nothing worked in parallel! There were blockers all over the place! As someone else said, TPL might well have been a &#x2F;&#x2F;TPL TO DO.We suspected that TPL was there as one of those \"look what I can do\" intrusions that received praise from more senior devs&#x2F;mgmt. even if it never actually did what it was supposed to do. reply pavlov 15 hours agoprevIt costs a million dollars to run a service that essentially “uploads a 2KB CSV to a database” on Snowflake?And you can cut this in half by changing some defaults in instance lifetime?I’m starting to understand why Snowflake’s market cap is something like $50B. This sounds like a nice money-printing business if you can convince enterprises to use it. reply ludicity 13 hours agoparentI should clarify, the cost was coming from computers that engineers used to write queries against our database - the 2KB CSV was just how we managed their permissions, and the cost of that was negligible.The immense cost was coming from someone writing a query that translates to \"I need one row of data\" and then we get billed like $10-20 in idling compute. With multiple computers and several full-time SQL modellers, it adds up very, very quickly.As the guy that just has to keep Snowflake running smoothly and isn&#x27;t paying for it, it&#x27;s a really nice product. I would still prefer something else on principle because it isn&#x27;t open source, but eh, I guess it reduces my stress at work. reply pedro_hab 18 hours agoprevI had a friend in a similar situation, he explained the issue and how he would fix it.I was baffled and urged him to be careful and assume he was wrong that it had to be wrong.Anyways, he is still fixing it, getting some people to validate it.I would think he will save at least hundreds of thousands a year.But seriously, why a company that spends millions of dollars in an area would not hire an expert to try to save some money in it is beyond me. reply freeopinion 17 hours agoparentWhy would a manager of a multi-million dollar department reduce the department to a single-million dollar department? That would reduce the prestige of their own job. I&#x27;ve seen managers who were overstaffed by double work hard to double their staff again. And the only staff that actually accomplished anything were punished and culled.It doesn&#x27;t make sense until you realize that they operate in an environment where there is no competition that can disrupt their business model. If their costs go up, their rates go up. There is never an incentive for costs to go down. reply marcos100 17 hours agoparentprevBecause \"we don&#x27;t have the budget\". reply esafak 17 hours agorootparentThat \"we\" may be too low on the org chart, and the qualified manager may not be aware of the problem. reply ludicity 13 hours agoparentprevBecause it&#x27;s monopoly money or something man, I don&#x27;t know. reply joshuahutt 16 hours agoprevNow extrapolate this out and realize that 25-50% of our global tech economy is basically waste. reply BohuTANG 8 hours agoprevIndeed, under a pay-as-you-go model, if there&#x27;s a lack of precise control over the warehouse, such as a 10-minute suspension, it could lead to significant waste. This is because most queries might only take a few seconds, and the rest of the time is wasted. If you find Snowflake expensive, consider Databend. It&#x27;s an open-source, cost-efficient alternative to Snowflake, and it maintains a consistent product experience with Snowflake.Open-source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datafuselabs&#x2F;databend Databend vs. Snowflake: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;datafuselabs&#x2F;databend&#x2F;issues&#x2F;13059 Cloud: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.databend.com&#x2F; reply nickdothutton 17 hours agoprevThe unsaid part is that this kind of situation is everywhere. It only really hits home when (IMO) when you’ve had a couple of decades in the industry. We have totally squandered the abundance of resources in many sites&#x2F;situations&#x2F;use-cases. Whether it be IOPS or threads or memory or network bandwidth and latency. Yes premature optimisation is the root of all evil, but the other side of that coin is pretty ugly looking too. Not even because of monetary waste in many cases, but because of unnecessary complexity and fragility. For what? A slightly higher level of abstraction? A bit more interoperability? A marginal gain in some other metric? reply xyst 5 hours agoprev$500K per year saved.

CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max, three chips featuring groundbreaking technologies that deliver dramatically increased performance and unleash new capabilities for Mac. These are the first personal computer chips built using the industry-leading 3-nanometer process technology, allowing more transistors to be packed into a smaller space and improving speed and efficiency. Together, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max show how far Apple silicon for the Mac has come since the debut of the M1 family of chips. The M3 family of chips features a next-generation GPU that represents the biggest leap forward in graphics architecture ever for Apple silicon. The GPU is faster and more efficient, and introduces a new technology called Dynamic Caching, while bringing new rendering features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading to Mac for the first time. Rendering speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips.1 The CPU performance cores and efficiency cores are 30 percent and 50 percent faster than those in M1, respectively, and the Neural Engine is 60 percent faster than the Neural Engine in the M1 family of chips. And, a new media engine now includes support for AV1 decode, providing more efficient and high-quality video experiences from streaming services. The M3 family of chips continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon, and brings massive enhancements and new features to the new MacBook Pro and iMac. “Apple silicon has completely redefined the Mac experience. Every aspect of its architecture is designed for performance and power efficiency,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “With 3-nanometer technology, a next-generation GPU architecture, a higher-performance CPU, faster Neural Engine, and support for even more unified memory, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max are the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer.” The M3 family of chips is built using the industry-leading 3-nanometer process technology, and continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon. All-New GPU Features Dynamic Caching, Mesh Shading, and Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing The next-generation GPU inside the M3 family of chips represents the largest leap forward in graphics architecture for Apple silicon. It features Dynamic Caching that, unlike traditional GPUs, allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time. With Dynamic Caching, only the exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This is an industry first, transparent to developers, and the cornerstone of the new GPU architecture. It dramatically increases the average utilization of the GPU, which significantly increases performance for the most demanding pro apps and games. With the M3 family of chips, hardware-accelerated ray tracing comes to the Mac for the first time. Ray tracing models the properties of light as it interacts with a scene, allowing apps to create extremely realistic and physically accurate images. This, along with the new graphics architecture, allows pro apps to deliver up to 2.5x the speed of the M1 family of chips. Game developers can use ray tracing for more accurate shadows and reflections, creating deeply immersive environments. Additionally, the new GPU brings hardware-accelerated mesh shading to the Mac, delivering greater capability and efficiency to geometry processing, and enabling more visually complex scenes in games and graphics-intensive apps. This breakthrough GPU architecture enables all of these enhancements and features while maintaining Apple silicon’s legendary power efficiency. In fact, the M3 GPU is able to deliver the same performance as M1 using nearly half the power, and up to 65 percent more performance at its peak.

A Faster and More Efficient CPU The next-generation CPU in M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max features architectural improvements to the performance and efficiency cores. The performance cores are up to 30 percent faster than those in the M1 family, so tasks like compiling and testing millions of lines of code in Xcode are even faster, and musicians can use hundreds of audio tracks, plug-ins, and virtual instruments in Logic Pro. The efficiency cores are up to 50 percent faster than the efficiency cores in M1, so everyday tasks are faster than ever, while allowing the system to maximize battery life. Together, these cores create a CPU that delivers the same multithreaded performance as M1 using as little as half the power, and up to 35 percent more performance at peak power.

The M3 family of chips feature efficiency cores that are up to 50 percent faster than those in the M1 family. previous next Unrivaled Unified Memory Architecture, up to 128GB Each chip in the M3 family features a unified memory architecture, a hallmark of Apple silicon. This delivers high bandwidth, low latency, and unmatched power efficiency. Having a single pool of memory within a custom package means all of the technologies in the chip can access the same data without copying it between multiple pools of memory, further improving performance and efficiency, and reducing the amount of memory a system requires for the majority of tasks. Additionally, support for up to 128GB of memory unlocks workflows previously not possible on a laptop, such as AI developers working with even larger transformer models with billions of parameters.

The unified memory architecture of M3 delivers high bandwidth, low latency, unmatched power efficiency, and supports up to 24GB of fast, unified memory. previous next Custom Engines for AI and Video M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max also have an enhanced Neural Engine to accelerate powerful machine learning (ML) models. The Neural Engine is up to 60 percent faster than in the M1 family of chips, making AI/ML workflows even faster while keeping data on device to preserve privacy. Powerful AI image processing tools, like noise reduction and super resolution in Topaz, get even faster. Scene edit detection in Adobe Premiere and Smart Conform in Final Cut Pro also see a boost in performance. All three chips in the M3 family also have an advanced media engine, providing hardware acceleration to the most popular video codecs, including H.264, HEVC, ProRes, and ProRes RAW. And for the first time, the media engine supports AV1 decoding, enabling power-efficient playback of streaming services to further extend battery life. The Neural Engine in M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max is up to 60 percent faster than in the M1 family of chips, making AI and machine learning workflows even faster. M3: Phenomenal Performance for the Most Popular Systems M3 features 25 billion transistors — 5 billion more than M2. It has a 10-core GPU featuring the next-generation architecture that is 65 percent faster than M1 for graphics performance.

M3 Max: A Tremendous Leap in Performance for the Most Demanding Pro Workloads M3 Max pushes the transistor count up to 92 billion and takes pro performance to the next level. The 40-core GPU is up to 50 percent faster than M1 Max, and support for up to 128GB of unified memory allows AI developers to work with even larger transformer models with billions of parameters. The 16-core CPU features 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores, achieving astonishing performance that’s up to 80 percent faster than M1 Max. And with two ProRes engines, M3 Max makes video post-production work on even the highest-resolution content fast and fluid, whether using DaVinci Resolve, Adobe Premiere Pro, or Final Cut Pro. M3 Max is designed for pros needing the highest performance available in a MacBook Pro with industry-leading battery life in a pro laptop. M3 Max consists of 92 billion transistors and delivers a tremendous increase in performance for the most demanding pro workloads. Better for the Environment The power-efficient performance of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max helps the new MacBook Pro and iMac meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency, and helps the new MacBook Pro achieve the longest battery life ever in a Mac — up to 22 hours.2 This results in less time needing to be plugged in and less energy consumed over its lifetime. Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes the entire manufacturing supply chain and life cycle of every product. This means that every chip in every Mac, from design to manufacturing, will be carbon neutral.

M2 Pro had 200GB&#x2F;s, M3 Pro only has 150GB&#x2F;s. M3 Max only has 400GB&#x2F;s on the higher binned part.- Just like the low-spec M3 14\" has one fewer Thunderbolt port, it also doesn&#x27;t officially support Thunderbolt 4 (like M1&#x2F;M2 before it)- The M3 Pro loses the option for an 8TB SSD. Likely because it was a low volume part for that spec.- The M3 Pro actually has more E-cores than the Max (6 vs 4). Interesting to see them take this away on a higher-specced part; seems like Intel wouldn&#x27;t do this reply ChuckMcM 6 hours agoparentI&#x27;m wondering now if Apple tracks this sort of stuff in their released machines. I know my iPad always asks me if I want to send stats to Apple (and I always say no). So let&#x27;s say that enough people do, then do they have a good idea of how often all the performance cores are used? Max memory B&#x2F;W consumed? Stuff like that. Back when I was at Intel there were always interesting tradeoffs between available silicon&#x2F;thermal&#x2F;margin resource and what made it into the chip. Of course Intel didn&#x27;t have any way (at that time) to collect statistics so it was always \"... but I think we should ...\" not a lot of data. reply threeseed 6 hours agorootparentApple shares anonymous usage data by default on all their operating systems and users are asked again on every major update.Given that there has never been any public incidents about it and what we know about similar defaults I would be surprised if Apple is getting less than 95% opt-in rate.But I suspect at high-end they only really care about the performance of a few dozen professional apps e.g. Logic or Final Cut.

For example, with base M2pro at 6 p cores and base M3pro at 5 p cores, one would want ~20% faster cores to compensate for the lack of one core in parallel processing scenarios where things scale well.

As M3 cores perform better than M2 cores, I expect the M3 configuration to perform similar to the M2 one, even though it trades performance cores for efficiency cores.

Although I am still using an Intel 16-inch MacBook, I really wanted to see how the M3 fared against the M2, not Intel and M1. I think it&#x27;s no surprise the M3 exceeds the Intel Core i7-9750H in basically all of Apple&#x27;s own benchmarking. My real question, which will probably be answered next week, is how it compares to the generation right before it.My work laptop is a 14-inch MacBook Pro and I&#x27;ve been impressed with the battery life considering all of the containers that run (on Kubernetes!) as part of my dev workflow. I guess Apple deciding to compare Intel and M1 was to try to convince existing MacBook users to upgrade to the latest generation CPUs. reply internet2000 8 hours agoparentI imagine the amount of people upgrading from an M2 Mac will be close to 0, while there&#x27;s a lot of Intel stragglers out there. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentIntel straggler here.

Like ambient light sensor, port quality (ie. how recessed the USB-C port is and how much strain it can take), audio output quality (Macs have powered headphone jacks for high impedance headphones) and of course speaker quality which on Macs is second to none.The Thinkpad by comparison has poor quality speakers, no ambient light sensor so it doesn&#x27;t auto adjust the screen or keyboard backlight. Its USB-C ports are also not very strong so the any strain on them or wiggle will cause them to disconnect - they certainly feel very fragile.I hear the Thinkpad Z13&#x2F;Z16 is more comparable to a Macbook but again it doesn&#x27;t have little details like an ambient light sensor which seems an odd omission in a luxury laptop and price wise it&#x27;s practically the same.That said, the new AMD Ryzen 7840HS and 7940HS chips are pretty competitive with an equivalent Apple M2:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;processors&#x2F;amd-ryzen-9-7940hshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;macs&#x2F;mac14-15 reply LtdJorge 1 minute agorootparentAnd GeekBench is a pretty bad benchmark.There&#x27;s also the 7945HX which is a 16 core CPU, but only comes with big dedicated GPUs, sadly. pb7 50 minutes agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t really like Apple, mainly because of how they handle the app store vendor lock in stuff, and I hate macOS.

M3 Max gets quite a bit higher transistor count, but M3 is only 37B transistors while M1 was 33.7B. Apple and&#x2F;or N3 absolutely suck here.Looks like I might be keeping my M1 system for yet another upgrade cycle. reply paulmd 4 hours agorootparentthe backstory here is that TSMC N3 is a trainwreck, it&#x27;s now separated into two different nodes, N3B (for bad) and N3E (enhanced). N3E gets the promised step that was originally for N3, but it only enters volume production next year. Supposedly it will actually bring costs down (and yields up) because this is where some additional steps go EUV. Both TSMC and Samsung have been fucking around with their marketing around nodes to try and say they&#x27;re first in volume 4nm production, but both are having problems with the final bosses of FINFET at 3nm and after this both TSMC and Samsung do GAAFET and solve a different set of problems. Past that lies... nothing. Hyper-NA seems dead.In the meantime, M3 is on N3B despite very low yields, which surely applied design pressure to keep size down, and the power gains are not as good, and also the density is worse than promised. Apple also surely feels pressure to keep prices high (bait-tier M3 base option with 8GB lol) and honestly they probably are going to be tough to justify on a performance&#x2F;efficiency basis compared to very fierce ARMv8 competition (we are now testing the thesis there&#x27;s no difference lol). Apple still has advantages but man do they take you to the cleaners for the result, a loaded apple laptop is obscene. I chose to go for an older loaded M1 Max instead of waiting for M3, because I could actually get a nice laptop that wouldn&#x27;t impose limits on a prosumer etc. 1TB is all anyone can afford still and that&#x27;s really silly.(SSD prices in particular are absolutely inexcusable lol.

There were a lot of apple silicons before M1, after all. But certainly TSMC is a bunch of the problem here.I think they&#x27;ll hustle to refresh it and do M3+ as a fast follow in 6-12 months with N3E, the cost economics are very favorable to jump as soon as there&#x27;s the volume. That doesn&#x27;t mean MBP gets refreshed immediately though, they&#x27;ll ramp on the phones (iphone 16&#x2F;16 pro, etc) and base-tier M3+ or whatever first. reply boomfunky 8 hours agorootparentprevApple signed a deal with TSMC to purchase nearly all of their available 3nm chips for the next year. Ethical or not, they positioned themselves to ensure almost no competitors could develop on 3nm until they did first since no fab on earth has the scale of TSMC. They could ride this plan for years if it pays them. reply giantrobot 7 hours agorootparentHow is Apple buying all the production slots for a process in any way unethical? It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re buying them and then burying the chips in a landfill. They paid TSMC&#x27;s asking price for production slots. AMD or Intel could have bought those same slots but didn&#x27;t. TSMC has limited capacity at 3nm, it was up for sale, Apple bought it.

It’s likely cheaper than legal action. reply paulmd 4 hours agorootparentprevnot only is outbidding the competition not unethical (as a sibling notes), apple actually is very involved in the early node work etc. a lot of this work is literally done for apple, it is \"exclusive games\" in the \"this game would not have been made without the sponsorship\" sense. this literally would not have been brought to market on the same timelines if Tim Apple wasn&#x27;t signing a couple billion dollars a year to TSMC right upfront.Apple pays lavishly to support TSMC&#x27;s early node research, and they get their say in what happens in the R&D process, and very early insight into the node and their say on how it would work for them as they do their rollout. TSMC gets carried through the research phases much faster than their competitors can do, and it&#x27;s led them to be on an absolute tear starting with 7nm. And they absolutely cannot fill the same level of demand with the same level of R&D funding from any of their competitors.It&#x27;s been a healthy, productive long-term partnership, TSMC is maybe the only supplier Apple can&#x27;t boss around and Apple is certainly a client that is always too big to fire. Doesn&#x27;t mean every apple product is good (and TSMC can still flub, and their competitors are catching up a little bit) but Apple can move whatever they need to lol, they are masters of supply chain managment. They can cover TSMC&#x27;s mistakes if needed, and they have insight into exactly what is happening as the node is developed and how they need to maneuver their product stack around to exploit it.Engineers study designs, CEOs study logistics. Also true of NVIDIA btw lol, they are very logistics-oriented because they make up such a large marketshare. How many companies on the planet are ordering big bulk runs of GDDR? Well, if we are ordering 20% of the planet&#x27;s GDDR on a fixed timetable then maybe we can get a custom version, micron, right? (9 months later, GDDR5X&#x2F;6X is born lol)It is an interesting contrast to Intel - this is almost the same kind of synergistic relationship as intel&#x27;s own fab and IP side have historically had together. Did intel fail because they had a tight fab-design coupling, or did they fail because they had a rotted internal culture and then the fab slipped a bunch? reply bee_rider 8 hours agorootparentprevNot running their own fabs makes it easier, right? They presumably pay a premium for being the first to use a generation, but not anywhere near as much as the full cost of developing it, since TSMC can sell that capacity to everybody else when they are done with it. reply blovescoffee 8 hours agorootparentprevThey are literally on the 3nm process.

Anyway my point that they are a generation ahead still stands. replyezfe 8 hours agoparentprevI still know a number of my colleagues who haven&#x27;t jumped onto the Apple Silicon machines despite our 2019 Intel machines being out of warranty (and thus eligible for replacement) for two years now reply andrewprock 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m still using a 2015 macbook for my personal daily driver. I have to plug it in regularly, but otherwise it works just fine for everything except video editing. reply MBCook 7 hours agorootparentI thought the same, but ended up upgrading to an M1 Air due to a hardware failure.Sure it feels 100x faster. But more than that it’s DEAD SILENT (no fan in the machine!) and completely cool.The temperature&#x2F;noise, if I had experienced it myself first, would have probably gotten me to upgrade.I use a 2019 Intel MBP at work. It’s much faster than my old 2015 too, but with the additional heat and noise I didn’t really want one.I would have taken the noise&#x2F;heat of the M1 + 2018 or 2019 performance. Instead I got heat&#x2F;noise of the M1 and far better performance, for a fraction of what my 2015 cost (unadjusted) new.Amazing upgrade. reply pantulis 1 hour agorootparentI got an M2 Pro Mini a couple of weeks ago to replace my 2018 i7 MBP and while it is obviously snappier and you feel it&#x27;s more powerful without running benchmarks the main difference is that: it is silent.

Why would anyone waste their cash to replace something that works without having any compelling reason? reply fastball 7 hours agorootparentBecause the productivity gains from upgrading can be quite large relative to the cost of upgrading, esp when you factor in the average salary in this community.I spend 8-10 hours on my Macbook every day. The amount of time I&#x27;ve saved &#x2F; productivity I&#x27;ve gained by things just running faster and by being more mobile (much longer battery life) is huge compared to the $2000 price tag.Frugality is good but there are some things in life (depending on your personal circumstances) where it does in fact make sense to upgrade for clear benefits. reply JohnBooty 5 hours agorootparentReally depends on what you&#x27;re doing.I spend 8-10 hours a day coding on my 2018 MBP (web apps - Postgres and Rails or Python) but almost none of that is really CPU-bound in my case. The meat of my work, the actual coding and iteration, is not limited by the aging CPU.The one thing that&#x27;s painfully slow is rebuilding Docker images, but we don&#x27;t do that too often. Less than once per week.I actually am upgrading soon, but it is not going to make an amazing difference for me in terms of productivity in my current work. reply rewmie 4 hours agorootparentprev> Because the productivity gains from upgrading can be quite large relative to the cost of upgrading, esp when you factor in the average salary in this community.You see, this is simply not true. At all. By far.I have a cheap Intel laptop released 8-10 years ago. It shipped with 8GB of RAM and 4 cores. I bought it on a clearance sale for around $500. I use it still to this day to work on webapps, including launching half a dozen services with Docker Compose. The only time I experience any type of slowdown is when I launch IntelliJ.I also have new kit, including a M2 MacBook.There is absolutely nothing I can do with my M2 laptop that I cannot do well with my cheap old Intel laptop. Nothing. The only issue I have with my old laptop is battery life, and that&#x27;s just because I don&#x27;t bother replacing it.Please do point out a single concrete example of \"productivity gains\" that I would get by spending $2k on a new laptop. reply xxs 1 hour agorootparentThe only downside would be struggling with 8GB, which should be upgradable just as well. 10y old would have a cd&#x2F;dvd tray - that can be replaced by an SSD for 4TB of goodliness (SATA but still good enough).My spouse has a 12y old laptop that has had pretty much everything (but the soldered GPU) upgraded - CPU, memory, HDD->SSD, CD-SSD, WiFi (to support 5GHz), keyboard (replaced), fan & heatsink, battery (replaced, might rebuild one w&#x2F; LG&#x27;s 18650 MJ1). Unfortunately pre-Sandy Bridge memory is capped at 8GB, so it shows its age - still an amazing thing. reply karolist 2 hours agorootparentprevI love responses like this, we should think hard first why NOT to upgrade, instead of doing reverse. reply MBCook 7 hours agorootparentprevSome people have experienced downsides you might want to know about.For example as you passed 2016-2019, not only did you have the butterfly keyboard mess but each generation reportedly got hotter and thus louder.My 2015 was quieter&#x2F;cooler than my 2019.So if you’re happy it may turn out that even though the newer machine has better performance it feels like a downgrade for other reasons.(I don’t think that’s the case here) reply karolist 2 hours agorootparent2019 16\" no longer used the butterfly keyboard, they have a physical Esc key and something Apple called \"magic keyboard\", really a scissor based mechanism that&#x27;s really pleasant to type on and doesn&#x27;t stop working with a tiny bit of dust under the cap.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;guide&#x2F;butterfly-keyboard-vs-scisso... reply georgespencer 3 hours agorootparentprev> Why is this sort of question always framed as […]OP didn&#x27;t frame it any way at all as far as I can tell, but either way it seems like an entirely reasonable question to ask of someone on a forum which is largely comprised of computer and programming enthusiasts who has not upgraded their daily driver for nearly a decade.> as if spending money on the new shiny without any reason is normal or desirable?Every single person who spends their money on \"the new shiny\" has a reason. You may not find the reason edifying, but that&#x27;s irrelevant to your stated argument.> Why would anyone waste their cash to replace something that works without having any compelling reason?As you were doubtless aware when you specifically constructed a straw man argument predicated on an entirely false premise and laden with your own subjective judgements about \"waste\" and things that \"work\" and \"compelling\" reasons, nobody does this.I suspect what you really mean is that you believe people upgrade their machines without what _you_ consider to be a good reason. You think people are too quick to upgrade when their machine isn&#x27;t the very latest, or when it&#x27;s got a dent, or when it&#x27;s slowing down a little.If you&#x27;d written what you really believe -- that people should not upgrade as rapidly as they do -- you&#x27;d probably have pulled on the thread for a further 0.02s and realised that everyone has different values and priorities, and you likely \"waste money\" in others&#x27; eyes across multiple line items of your annual budget. So it&#x27;s terrific luck, really, that the internet&#x27;s various competing interpretations of a \"compelling reason\" can&#x27;t stop you from spending your money however you&#x27;d like. reply rewmie 14 minutes agorootparent> (..) it seems like an entirely reasonable question to ask of someone on a forum which is largely comprised of computer and programming enthusiasts who has not upgraded their daily driver for nearly a decade.Are professionals expected to mindlessly throw money around at the new shiny without having absolutely no compelling reason to do so?I think my post was rather straight-forward: people buy things only when they feel there is a clear upside to it. If you made that purchase 2 or 3 or 4 years ago, you need a very good reason to just throw it away and buy a new replacement. You need to at least make a valid case for it, otherwise you are just wasting your hard-earned money for nothing at all.> Every single person who spends their money on \"the new shiny\" has a reason.Why was OP framing that question on whether no reason was needed then, and instead people had to justify why weren&#x27;t they wasting their money on the new shiny? Why is being new and shiny such a strong rationale that the onus of not buying is placed on not buying?These are simple questions. In fact, all it would take is provide a single compelling reason why it would be a good idea to waste money on a M3 Macbook Pro when you already own a M2&#x2F;M1 Macbook Pro, or even a late 2010s Macbook Pro. Hell, why on earth would you even waste money on a M3 Macbook Pro if you already have a M2 Macbook Air?If you cannot answer this question, why would it be anything than absolutely foolish to pretend that people should justify not buying a M3? reply ryandrake 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m rocking a 2017 MacBook Air and it&#x27;s great--really the only down side is that Apple stopped supporting it in macOS past Monterey. Almost all of my past and present Apple hardware has long outlasted software support, which is my biggest complaint with the company. reply josephcsible 7 hours agorootparentprevBecause hardware vendors don&#x27;t provide security updates forever, and they refuse to open-source enough of their code that other people can do it for them. reply latchkey 7 hours agorootparentprevIt is an honest question.For some background in my thinking, it is because today&#x27;s announcement really focused on Intel users. My semi-educated guess is that Apple did a whole bunch of user studies and realized there are a lot of people out there, like the OP, who haven&#x27;t upgraded yet, hence the focus. As a result, I&#x27;m genuinely curious why this person hasn&#x27;t upgraded.And for my own personal experience, the upgrade&#x2F;switch from intel to m*, is night and day better ergonomics as a developer. It isn&#x27;t just some shiny new toy or a waste in cash. For the same reason professional mechanics in F1 don&#x27;t use shitty tools to work on their cars. Or tour de france racers aren&#x27;t using 30lbs Huffy bikes.TLDR: I don&#x27;t give a f&#x27;ck if you don&#x27;t happen to upgrade, that&#x27;s your choice.

None at all.In fact, it boggles the mind how anyone could justify replacing any MacBook pro with a M3 one by claiming \"pros don&#x27;t use shitty tools\", as if MacBook Pros packing an Intel core 7&#x2F;M1&#x2F;M2 suddenly became shitty laptops just because Apple released a new one. reply VancouverMan 3 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been holding off on upgrading some older Intel Mac minis I have while waiting for the memory situation to improve, but so far it hasn&#x27;t.Ideally, I&#x27;d consolidate these older systems into one new Mac mini, or even a Mac Studio.I&#x27;d like at least 64 GB of memory, at a reasonable price.The latest Mac mini maxes out at only 32 GB of RAM, if I&#x27;m remembering it right.I think the latest low-end Mac Studio could be upgraded to 64 GB of memory, but the last time I priced it, this upgrade cost more than I&#x27;d been expecting. It also put the overall cost above what I&#x27;d prefer to pay.While I&#x27;d like to keep using a Mac, it&#x27;s looking more and more like I&#x27;d be better off just building a PC, where I could likely get comparable enough processing performance, but far more memory (and storage) at a lower cost. reply paulryanrogers 7 hours agorootparentprevThis isn&#x27;t Huffy bikes vs F1 racers. Unless your workload is heavily CPU bound. And even then it&#x27;s probably more like a 20yo F1 car vs a new one.We also live on a finite planet.

I hardly travel these days, but throwing it in a backpack isn&#x27;t the end of the world.That said, I was actually thinking ergonomics in terms of performance of development. The thing is so fast that commands complete faster than I can deal with them. My IDE can keep up with me. I can run a ton of apps and it doesn&#x27;t slow down or glitch.

On my old intel MacBook, I was looking at an hour or so to build, and it could only complete one build on the battery if that. Testing took a similarly absurd amount of time.The M1 dropped both times by in the region of 30 minutes, could do multiple rounds on a single charge and didn&#x27;t make a tonne of noise while doing so.The amount of time savings you get from the improved CPU perf is quantifiable, and you can assign a monetary amount to that time.Now if your use case is not performance (cpu, battery, etc) limited then of course there&#x27;s no reason to upgrade, ever really, but that would apply to any laptop or pc not just Macs. reply tpmx 3 hours agorootparentprevx86-64 docker containers?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;docker&#x2F;roadmap&#x2F;issues&#x2F;384 is still open. :( reply edp 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t know exactly why this bug would still be open, but you can use x86-64 images on an ARM64 Mac :https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.docker.com&#x2F;desktop&#x2F;release-notes&#x2F;#4250I have been using it for a few months (in beta) and it works great ! reply rokkitmensch 8 hours agorootparentprevFiscal prudence? reply josephcsible 7 hours agorootparentTo me, \"personal daily driver\" sounds like where you&#x27;d do online banking.

OK, got it Skip to main content The Keyword Latest stories Product updates Company news Subscribe GMAIL New Gmail protections for a safer, less spammy inbox Oct 03, 2023 2 min read Starting in 2024, we’ll require bulk senders to authenticate their emails, allow for easy unsubscription and stay under a reported spam threshold. N Neil Kumaran Group Product Manager, Gmail Security & Trust Share It’s clear that email has become an essential part of daily communication. And whether you’re submitting a job application or staying in touch with a loved one, your emails should be safe and secure. Gmail’s AI-powered defenses stop more than 99.9% of spam, phishing and malware from reaching inboxes and block nearly 15 billion unwanted emails every day. But now, nearly 20 years after Gmail launched, the threats we face are more complex and pressing than ever. So today, we’re introducing new requirements for bulk senders — those who send more than 5,000 messages to Gmail addresses in one day — to keep your inbox even safer and more spam-free. Focus on email validation Many bulk senders don’t appropriately secure and configure their systems, allowing attackers to easily hide in their midst. To help fix that, we’ve focused on a crucial aspect of email security: the validation that a sender is who they claim to be. As basic as it sounds, it’s still sometimes impossible to verify who an email is from given the web of antiquated and inconsistent systems on the internet. Last year we started requiring that emails sent to a Gmail address must have some form of authentication. And we’ve seen the number of unauthenticated messages Gmail users receive plummet by 75%, which has helped declutter inboxes while blocking billions of malicious messages with higher precision. That’s great progress, but there’s much more we need to do — starting with new requirements for large senders. New requirements for bulk senders By February 2024, Gmail will start to require that bulk senders: Authenticate their email: You shouldn’t need to worry about the intricacies of email security standards, but you should be able to confidently rely on an email’s source. So we're requiring those who send significant volumes to strongly authenticate their emails following well-established best practices. Ultimately, this will close loopholes exploited by attackers that threaten everyone who uses email. Enable easy unsubscription: You shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to stop receiving unwanted messages from a particular email sender. It should take one click. So we’re requiring that large senders give Gmail recipients the ability to unsubscribe from commercial email in one click, and that they process unsubscription requests within two days. We’ve built these requirements on open standards so that once senders implement them, everyone who uses email benefits. Ensure they’re sending wanted email: Nobody likes spam, and Gmail already includes many tools that keep unwanted messages out of your inbox. To add yet another protection, moving forward, we’ll enforce a clear spam rate threshold that senders must stay under to ensure Gmail recipients aren’t bombarded with unwanted messages. This is an industry first, and as a result, you should see even less spam in your inbox. We aren’t the only ones pushing for these changes. Our industry partners also see the pressing need to institute them: \"No matter who their email provider is, all users deserve the safest, most secure experience possible,” says Marcel Becker, Sr. Dir. Product at Yahoo. “In the interconnected world of email, that takes all of us working together. Yahoo looks forward to working with Google and the rest of the email community to make these common sense, high-impact changes the new industry standard.\" These practices should be considered basic email hygiene, and many senders already meet most of these requirements. For those who need help to improve their systems, we’re sharing clear guidance before enforcement begins in February 2024. These changes are like a tune-up for the email world, and by fixing a few things under the hood, we can keep email running smoothly. But just like a tune-up, this is not a one-time exercise. Keeping email more secure, user friendly and spam-free requires constant collaboration and vigilance from the entire email community. And we'll keep working together to make sure your inbox stays safe.

I have correctly configured sfp, dmarc, dkim, reverse dns for the Mailserver and have tested the wording with multiple mail testing services to make sure it doesn&#x27;t have keywords that get automatically flagged.And yet after like 50 emails to parents with yahoo email addresses they are giving me errors because of \"unusual volume of emails from your domain\"There is no form, no human to talk to and they just block you.Angry parents come to me or course because they never redeived the activation link so I had to put up a disclaimer stating that if they should not use a yahoo email address if they have a different one reply tzs 12 minutes agorootparentI have no idea if this still works, and it probably wouldn&#x27;t work for a school, but 15-20 years ago the way to get Yahoo to stop blocking your emails was to call up your ad rep and say something like \"Why the heck should we keep spending $10000&#x2F;month buying ads on Yahoo when any new customers we get from those ads that use Yahoo email end up pissed off at us and maybe even charge back because it looks like we are completely ignoring them because they don&#x27;t see our emails????\".That would get you added to a \"never block mail from this domain\" whitelist that had higher precedence than everything else. reply zo1 2 hours agorootparentprevI seriously don&#x27;t get why we can&#x27;t have some sort of licensing authority for this type of thing. Maybe they issue you a secret key to include in email headers, or put your entire domain on some sort of whitelist. And complaints get handled by a human to confirm that it&#x27;s not a \"oh I don&#x27;t like this, or I don&#x27;t remember signing up for this\" non-sense complaint that would get you blocked or have your license revoked with a normal provider.Am I crazy or just missing some super obvious gap with this path? reply autoexec 1 hour agorootparentYou should try starting one. You&#x27;d just need to work with every email provider on the planet (including people running personal email servers) and convince them to let you decide for them what is spam or not, get them to implement a massive list of IPs&#x2F;domains to whitelist on their servers, get them to let you edit that list whenever new mass mailers sign up for your \"We&#x27;re totally not spam\" service, and then get them to provide some way for complaints to come back to you so that you can enforce your rules. It&#x27;d be a hard sell for mail providers, and it wouldn&#x27;t solve the spam problem for any messages that aren&#x27;t sanctioned by your service.You&#x27;d also have to do a lot of work to validate new senders long before they send their first message and you start getting complaints or else you&#x27;re just letting spammers pay you to completely bypass every mail provider&#x27;s spam filters until they finally get blocked and have to create a new account with you under a different company name.If you can convince everyone to trust you, and your service, and that it&#x27;d be worth it for mail providers to do all that work on their end on top of everything they&#x27;re doing currently to prevent spam, it really could improve deliverability. reply account42 50 minutes agorootparentprev> I don&#x27;t remember signing up for thisThis is often not a non-sense complaint.

If one person who received a forwarded email doesn&#x27;t like it and clicks the unsubscribe link, the original recipient (who clearly likes the email enough to forward it around) gets unsubscribed. That&#x27;s a bug. If you don&#x27;t like the unfunny newsletter your uncle keeps forwarding you, that&#x27;s a problem between you and your uncle, not between your uncle and his newsletter!The email submission form exists to ensure that the person unsubscribing is the person who is actually on the mailing list. It will not prevent an annoyed nephew from deliberately unsubscribing the original recipient, but it will prevent most cases of mistake by third parties.Similarly, many unsubscribe links require two clicks instead of one, because some email services used to automatically check out every link they found in the body of an email. A one-click link would unsubscribe everyone before they even saw the email. Nowadays we have better protocols and better email scanners, but old industry habits die hard. reply robocat 6 hours agorootparentI think you are mostly wrong. OP is complaining they sometimes have to enter their email address - that is absolutely unnecessary make-work.The page can prompt the email address, and have a simple unsubscribe button.

Personally I hate trying to play find-the-ubsubscribe-link, so I use the email client feature where possible (which also helps Gmail rate&#x2F;flag spam).Mostly I haven&#x27;t had problems with repeat spammers, except a republican politician (I&#x27;m not in the USA so doubly annoying). reply gumby 1 hour agorootparent> Mostly I haven&#x27;t had problems with repeat spammers, except a republican politician (I&#x27;m not in the USA so doubly annoying).I’m a republican (also not in the US sense — I want to get rid of the tie to the monarchy) but I also find that republican politicians seem to be really annoying! reply kijin 5 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone uses Gmail or a modern email client that understands the one-click List-Unsubscribe protocol, so senders must include an HTML unsubscribe link in the body of the email in order to comply with relevant rules in all jurisdictions. That link, unfortunately, can fall prey to the shenanigans I mentioned above.I understand the parent&#x27;s sentiment because we all want to unsubscribe from unwanted emails. But technical standards can&#x27;t distinguish unwanted emails from business-critical emails. You could legitimately cause someone damages by silently unsubscribing them from an important news feed. (Imagine that you silently unsubscribed an open-source maintainer from all github notifications!) Even worse, this kind of vulnerability disproportionately affects senders who try to follow the rules and make it easier for people to unsubscribe. Spammers don&#x27;t care and keep spammin&#x27;.Ideally, an email would have both a one-click List-Unsubscribe header and an HTML unsubscribe link in the body. The latter need not be one-click, and in fact, if it&#x27;s anything remotely important, should not be. reply account42 27 minutes agorootparent> The latter need not be one-click, and in fact, if it&#x27;s anything remotely important, should not be.It absolutely should be one-click. reply cuu508 4 hours agorootparentprev> Imagine that you silently unsubscribed an open-source maintainer from all github notifications!)Do open-source maintainers forward around their unsubscribe links in practice?The other problem with email scanners clicking links automatically can be solved without prompting for the email address. One simple solution is: if the link is clicked within a minute or so after sending the email there&#x27;s a chance the clicker is an automated system. Instead of unsubscribing right away, serve a HTTP POST form with a single \"Confirm Unsubscribe\" button. Normal users will rarely see the form, automated systems will hesitate to fire off HTTP POST requests. reply tempestn 5 hours agorootparentprevThey could perhaps pre-fill the email as a middle ground. reply kijin 5 hours agorootparentMany websites actually do this. It significantly weakens the defense against the forwarding problem because people will blindly click submit. But IMO it&#x27;s an acceptable compromise for anything not business-critical.Some people have come up with a trick to hide the unsubscribe link with CSS when it is inside atag, as in a forwarded email. It doesn&#x27;t work reliably, though. HTML email is still stuck in the 90s, it&#x27;s impossible to do anything fancy inside of it. Much easier to send the user to a real web page for an actual transaction. reply jack1243star 7 hours agorootparentprevThere is no \"mistake\" in wanting to unsubscribe from a mail list.

I&#x27;m sick of companies that send you spam (\"newsletters\") just because you interacted with them once, then when you unsubscribe, you get unsubscribed from that one list, so they keep spamming you just with a slightly different newsletter type.Never interact with spam. Unsubscribing just tells spammers that your email address is actively being checked, and that you&#x27;re the kind of person who clicks on links found in unsolicited messages. It can even end up getting you more spam (as you&#x27;ve noticed), and what looks like an innocent unsubscribe link can actually take you to a malicious website instead. You&#x27;ve really got nothing to gain by touching spam at all.The best way to deal with the spam that makes it into your inbox, especially spam that comes from specific senders with predictable subject lines&#x2F;body content like newsletters, is filtering. For example, just auto-delete anything from a domain you never want to hear from again. You never see it, and you leave them spending at least a little time&#x2F;effort shouting uselessly into the void.I tend not to auto-delete directly, but have things filtered into specific folders just in case. It takes almost no time to clear out when they get very full. Most filters are set once and forget. reply Pikamander2 1 hour agorootparent>Never interact with spam. Unsubscribing just tells spammers that your email address is actively being checked, and that you&#x27;re the kind of person who clicks on links found in unsolicited messages.This only applies to scam emails like newsletters from sketchy domains that you never signed up for, which are sent out specifically to find active email addresses. For those, clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link is indeed counterproductive.For actual businesses like Linkedin though, it makes more sense than not to unsubscribe from unwanted emails anytime they&#x27;re sent. On occasion you&#x27;ll find yourself back on a different newsletter list, but it&#x27;s relatively rare and more often than not just incompetence rather than malice; legitimate companies want to send their emails out to people who buy stuff, not people who mark them as spam and lower their reputation. reply autoexec 1 hour agorootparent> For actual businesses like Linkedin though, it makes more sense than not to unsubscribe from unwanted emails anytime they&#x27;re sent.Why?

Yahoo is particularly bad at this; it&#x27;s common for me to receive spam reports from yahoo on an entirely double-opt-in social site I run. My reaction there is to remove the reporter from all lists because the amount of damage a single spam report can do is immense; a single spam report can block delivery for weeks at a time to the 10k others that legitimately requested messages.

There’s basically zero value in “confirming” an email address is legitimate. Between all of the data breaches and various other ways to get actual email addresses this isn’t a problem. It’s also so cheap to send email there isn’t an operational cost where you need to optimise for sending only to know addresses.There is definitely a punitive cost for sending emails that are repeatedly marked as spam though. You also can’t just cycle IPs because a brand new IP with zero sender reputation is treated with almost as much suspicion by the big player as one that is known to be a spammer.It’s much better to give people an option to opt out, and to honour it. Most of the email sending providers (e.g., SendGrid, mailchimp, etc) force you to include the link and automatically block future sending to that address. Some will even provide you the option to provide a reason, where you can specify “I did not sign up for this” which in sufficient number will flag the sender account. I suspect the vast majority of cases where people unsubscribe but continue to get email is actually some incompetence from not having multiple disparate email systems sync back to a shared do not contact list (rather each system is maintaining its own).Click the unsubscribe button. reply ACow_Adonis 3 hours agorootparentthere&#x27;s a line in the movie the incredibles where robert (the hero) is meeting with the designer (edna) of super suits to design him a new suit even though such activities are technically illegal.The dialogue goes something like this:robert: you know I&#x27;m retired from hero work.Edna:As am I, Robert, yet here we are.so now it&#x27;s 2023. you&#x27;re telling me it&#x27;s now safe to click on unsubscribe to the spam emails.yet here we are.no, the strait forward response is to ignore and mark as spam any unsolicited emails you did not explicitly sign up for. don&#x27;t try to interact through the desired or expected channels of any entity that spams you. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentWhen you mark an email as spam, the mailing service emails the sender along with all the original headers.

We all hate the spam and dark patterns, and Google is a relatively responsible citizen of the email world in my experience so I hope this will be a positive step.However if email blocking becomes too aggressive then it can easily result in mails containing information that senders are literally required by law to provide to the recipient being silently dropped, which essentially means the mail service has caused the sender to unknowingly break the law. The penalties for not providing required information under consumer protection rules can be extremely serious in jurisdictions like the EU.And Joe Random can be a real customer who you are really required to provide with information but can still hit the \"this is spam\" button if they don&#x27;t particularly care or want to see it so reading too much into self-reported spam flags is a bit of a slippery slope. Combine that with mandating one-click unsubscribe but possibly without recognising types of emails that again the subscriber literally can&#x27;t legally not send (at least not without sending the same information to the same recipient some other way instead) and there could be some real danger here. reply j45 13 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m wondering if they see enough gmail traffic receiving such an email that maybe they can infer how much funny business might be going on? reply georgyo 10 hours agoprevReading all the comments makes me think I&#x27;m an outlier.I very aggressively unsubscribe from everything so I get very little mailing list spam.

Having remote images turned off is enough to stop most engagement pings. reply franga2000 11 minutes agorootparentAFAIK Gmail downloads and caches all images server-side the moment it receives the email, then replaces them with cached versions when viewing.

And I wasn&#x27;t even a Gmail customer, so it looks like they don&#x27;t really filter outgoing mail to other providers. It made my inbound filtering quite tricky as I couldn&#x27;t block Google as quite lot of legitimate traffic comes from friends using Gmail so the other Spamassassin rules (e.g. content analysis) had to do much of the heaving lifting. A couple of years back I gave up and outsourced the MX for my domain to Fastmail. Interestingly they also struggle to filter Gmail messages (which isn&#x27;t too surprising as they also use Spamassassin) but thankfully there are only a few a week that get past and I always make sure these are flagged as spam to train the filter.

My bet is on the latter, because Google has heavy restrictions on Gmail that make it impractical to use for sending bulk spam.> I am not sure what a big improvement this will be for the average user.It&#x27;s not going to be particularly noticeable for the average user, except for the second part (single-click unsubscribe, as opposed to a multi-step flow, is slightly stricter than what&#x27;s required by CAN-SPAM). It will probably make Google&#x27;s work easier, though, by having a publicly-known policy of rejecting emails without DKIM, as opposed the the status quo of having that be merely an open secret. reply maybeben 13 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of spam we get that isn&#x27;t trivially rejected (DMARC, malformed HELO, etc) is from real, actual gmail.

However the hard spam limit with Gmail in particular will get interesting. I predict this is going to create some insane headaches for indie Saas startups.Gmail is the only inbox provider that doesn’t offer a real feedback loop (you don’t actually know if a given email address marked you as spam when sending to gmail users). The FBL in Google postmaster tools is anonymized and unreliable at best.So essentially, you never know if a Gmail user marked you as spam so you can stop sending to them. Gmail will just by default mark your emails as spam for that user going forward, without telling you. This means your spam complaint level will inevitably rise over time without you knowing why and what email addresses are causing the issue.Unless Gmail actually starts providing a real FBL like other inbox providers, the hard spam limit is going to snowball into a nightmare for even the most conservative and legitimate senders. reply Macha 10 hours agoparentHonestly sounds like I&#x27;m on the side of Gmail here.Think about this from the perspective of an actual spammer. You get a notification that address XYZ is marked as spam by user ABC. Well, now you just email user ABC from a different address. reply pembrook 10 hours agorootparentNot even spammers want to waste time & money emailing people who have already marked their emails as spam (that&#x27;s as clear a signal as any to move onto the next victim).The real problem is, for legitimate senders, the people who send less emails actually get higher levels of spam complaints! This is because humans are human and they forget who you are. I would argue this actually incentivizes sending more emails. This is why marketers all recommend sending garbage emails daily&#x2F;weekly&#x2F;monthly.The truth is, the companies with full-time spam (marketing) departments will do just fine with these changes. It&#x27;s the little guy who is going to have to navigate these complexities (likely unsuccessfully), and get shut out from yet another technology that used to be open.On top of that, Google has started to offer perks for senders within Gmail for a $1,500 per year fee (VMC). They&#x27;re basically one step away from collecting rents on all of email by way of their monopoly. reply pests 3 hours agorootparentRight - spammers (and legit marketers) do not want an old or out of date email lists to work with. Wastes time and reduces the lists ROI. reply Synchro 57 minutes agoprevNone of that seems new. What would be new is if both gmail and Yahoo provided any means of allowing legit bulk senders to actually send properly.The one-click unsubscribe is from 2017&#x27;s RFC8058. Everyone that&#x27;s sending in volume is already doing all the usual stuff - DKIM, SPF, DMARC, matching reverse IPs, etc.The privacy-first email marketing service I wrote (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.smartmessages.net) implements account-wide unsubscribe by default (unsubscribing you from one list unsubscribes you from all). It requires double opt-in, and asks for explicit consent before doing any tracking whatsoever (so no Google Analytics, no cookies, no trackers), which of course is what the (at least EU and UK) law requires. You&#x27;re not going to see shitty exploiters like MailChimp doing anything like this; abusing your data is just too lucrative.It&#x27;s still ridiculously hard to deliver messages at any volume, and there is zero recourse when you are penalised incorrectly. Gmail&#x27;s spam filtering is just dire - if I send myself an email from gmail, it goes into spam. A large proportion of the spam I receive is sent from gmail.Google&#x27;s postmaster tools are a joke. It&#x27;s entirely normal for them to give you a \"bad\" spam rating when you have 0 spam reports, 0 auth failures, strict DKIM and DMARC, and every single message has double-opt-in audit trails. This useless feedback makes it very difficult for senders to actually comply with their ever stricter, but ever more opaque requirements.Proving that subscribers actually want to receive messages from you its difficult. So back in 2017 I wrote an outline proposal https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Smartmessages&#x2F;subscriptionproofrfc to create a standard, possibly built on top of DKIM keys, to provide provable subscriptions. This would pretty much solve the entire thing for legit senders, but of course the industry is not really interested in cooperation or complying with any law that might reduce the number of people they send to by even the tiniest amount.&#x2F;cynicalrant reply account42 10 minutes agoparent> legit bulk sendersNow who could you mean by those.> The privacy-first email marketing service I wroteOh right, spammers. reply EvanAnderson 13 hours agoprevHijacking the thread: I do some \"bulk\" sending for a 501(c)3 I volunteer for.

Otherwise you have issues with link scanners unsubscribing your recipients without their knowledge. There are some more complex ways to approach this with JavaScript checks for \"real browser\" but IMO these are more likely to create frustrating friction to unsubscribing (by not working if the user has an adblocker for example) than having the user click a button.I&#x27;ve seen this pattern of unsubscribe link, then click button approved as CAN-SPAM compliant more than once so I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a legal concern. The CAN-SPAM rule seems more targeted at the systems you used to see a lot that required the user to log into their account, type in their email address, or figure out a complicated \"communications preferences\" list to use the unsubscribe form.check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecfr.gov&#x2F;current&#x2F;title-16&#x2F;chapter-I&#x2F;subchapter-C...It&#x27;s a little fuzzy to me how exactly to interpret this but I think you could reasonably read it as allowing even unsubscribe pages that require you to type your email address in again (even though I detest these and don&#x27;t think the problem they&#x27;re intended to solve is a meaningful one). reply pests 3 hours agorootparent> unsubscribe pages that require you to type your email address in againThese are fine for me if the email is prepopulated. reply EvanAnderson 13 hours agorootparentprevSo many email security systems preemptively access every URL in messages.

Try listening to this without reading the subtitles for the first time: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=oQGwe2b18UAIt even causes funny problems within the UK. Even in high places like the parliament: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=I4k8dR04TzA reply anadalakra 11 hours agoprevAs a non-native English speaker, the \"randomness\" of English pronunciation has been a source of frustration for me for many years.I realized there are two types of issues: 1. Some sounds in English don&#x27;t exist in other languages and you have to learn them \"from scratch\". For example the \"flap T\" in butter. Or the particular American \"r\" (constrast it to the Spanish rolled r for instance). 2. Certain sounds I DID know how to make, but didn&#x27;t know WHEN to make them because spelling is so unreliable. For example, a word like \"color\" has two \"o\" letters but neither of them makes an \"ou\" sound - in fact they make two distinct sounds. For these, I realized you just have to practice it until your mouth \"remembers\" how to pronounce the word differently (i.e. creates muscle memory).Youglish is great for fine-tuning specific words.I also recommend BoldVoice (disclaimer: I&#x27;m a cofounder). We were YC S21 and built the app to help non-native English speakers improve their pronunciation with videos from Hollywood speech coaches and instant feedback via speech recognition ML. reply yhager 7 hours agoparentThere is no such thing as \"English pronunciation\". English does not have a regulatory body like Spanish or German have.There are many English dialects, and sounds (and meanings) vary, A LOT. It&#x27;s up to you whether you want to try and assimilate the local dialect of where you live right now, or you want to simply understand and be understood.There are many non-native speakers who are extremely easy to understand, even though it is clear that English is their second (or third) language. I believe the hardest part is to learn how to make sounds that do not exist in your native language (both consonants and vowels). But the good news is that there are ways to learn that. The human mouth is capable of pronouncing all human sounds, it is only a matter of practice.The English spelling is guided by meaning, not by sound. So trying to make the sounds out of the letters will always be a frustrating endeavor, as there will never be a single rule you can follow. reply bongobingo1 4 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_language_regulatorshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Association_of_Academies_of_th...I had no idea this would exist.

These bodies meet and discuss what the proper spelling of words should be, or they make up new words, and then they publish those guidelines for journalists, authors, and anyone who wants to speak \"properly\" to follow.It gives the language a good balance between spelling and pronouncing - that&#x27;s why you can pronounce most words in German and Spanish exactly how they are written (I think there are very very few exceptions, if at all). But this comes at a price of losing ability to track meaning some times.Sometimes it is not going so well, for example, look at the tumultuous German reform of 1996.. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;German_orthography_reform_of_1... reply JonathonW 6 hours agoparentprevDon&#x27;t worry; English pronunciation can be mastered simply through tough, thorough thought.(English \"o\" is tons of fun-- of the 22 vowel sounds listed on the English orthography page on Wikipedia, only two can&#x27;t generally have the letter \"o\" involved.) reply cmehdy 5 hours agorootparentThe Chaos (1922) - http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncf.idallen.com&#x2F;english.htmlMore than half of my life lived in English-speaking countries does not help quite enough to avoid a migraine with this one. reply teddyh 22 minutes agorootparentComplete version as originally published in 1920:reply looping8 2 hours agorootparentprevI have seen similar joke poems but this one was too much for me.

For example, in English, vowel length carries phonetic information, whereas in other languages it does not. If you mother tongue happens to fall in the latter category, it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that you&#x27;ll figure out how vowel length works, or even that you have to pay attention to it. reply deadbeeves 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not true. I use stress timing without even realizing that I&#x27;m using it nor understanding what it means, but I can realize when someone doesn&#x27;t use it. I learned it purely by ear, by mimicking the sounds other people make. More specifically, by copying their cadence. reply lottin 3 hours agorootparentYeah, like I said, it&#x27;s most unlikely that you&#x27;re using vowel length correctly. You can&#x27;t copy something you&#x27;re not aware of. For example, without looking it up, would you say &#x27;quit&#x27; and &#x27;quid&#x27; are pronounced with the same vowel length or not? reply guntherhermann 13 hours agoprevWow, what a fantastic website.

One time I had to work with a Vietnamese woman (let&#x27;s call her Anna) who said \"transaction\" like \"trunsun\" or something; definitely one syllable too few. After several months I was quite able to understand most of what she said, although occasionally I needed her teammate (Barbara) to translate for us. To restate GP&#x27;s point, both Anna and Barbara spoke grammatically correct English and had definite East Asian accents, but Barbara pronounced things correctly and Anna didn&#x27;t, so Barbara was easier to speak with, while when speaking with Anna I often had to ask her to repeat herself. reply diehunde 7 hours agoparentprevIs that common though?

By Rogé Karma Illustration by The Atlantic. Sources: Shutterstock; Getty. OCTOBER 30, 2023, 7:30 AM ET SHARE SAVED STORIES SAVE Listen to this article 00:00 12:50 Produced by ElevenLabs and NOA, News Over Audio, using AI narration. Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET on October 30, 2023 The publicly traded company is disappearing. In 1996, about 8,000 firms were listed in the U.S. stock market. Since then, the national economy has grown by nearly $20 trillion. The population has increased by 70 million people. And yet, today, the number of American public companies stands at fewer than 4,000. How can that be? One answer is that the private-equity industry is devouring them. When a private-equity fund buys a publicly traded company, it takes the company private—hence the name. (If the company has not yet gone public, the acquisition keeps that from happening.) This gives the fund total control, which in theory allows it to find ways to boost profits so that it can sell the company for a big payday a few years later. In practice, going private can have more troubling consequences. The thing about public companies is that they’re, well, public. By law, they have to disclose information about their finances, operations, business risks, and legal liabilities. Taking a company private exempts it from those requirements. That may not have been such a big deal when private equity was a niche industry. Today, however, it’s anything but. In 2000, private-equity firms managed about 4 percent of total U.S. corporate equity. By 2021, that number was closer to 20 percent. In other words, private equity has been growing nearly five times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole. James Surowiecki: The method in the market’s madness Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University who studies corporate finance, told me that if current trends continue, “we could end up with a completely opaque economy.” This should alarm you even if you’ve never bought a stock in your life. One-fifth of the market has been made effectively invisible to investors, the media, and regulators. Information as basic as who actually owns a company, how it makes its money, or whether it is profitable is “disappearing indefinitely into private equity darkness,” as the Harvard Law professor John Coates writes in his book The Problem of Twelve. This is not a recipe for corporate responsibility or economic stability. A private economy is one in which companies can more easily get away with wrongdoing and an economic crisis can take everyone by surprise. And to a startling degree, a private economy is what we already have. America learned the hard way what happens when corporations operate in the dark. Before the Great Depression, the whole U.S. economy functioned sort of like the crypto market in 2021. Companies could raise however much money they wanted from whomever they wanted. They could claim almost anything about their finances or business model. Investors often had no good way of knowing whether they were being defrauded, let alone whether to expect a good return. Then came the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. From October to December of 1929, the stock market lost 50 percent of its value, with more losses to come. Thousands of banks collapsed, wiping out the savings of millions of Americans. Unemployment spiked to 25 percent. The Great Depression generated a crisis of confidence for American capitalism. Public hearings revealed just how rampant corporate fraud had become before the crash. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws launched a regime of “full and fair disclosure” and created a new government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to enforce it. Now if companies wanted to raise money from the public, they would have to disclose a wide array of information to the public. This would include basic details about the company’s operations and finances, plus a comprehensive list of major risks facing the company, plans for complying with current and future regulations, and documentation of outstanding legal liabilities. All of these disclosures would be reviewed for accuracy by the SEC. This regime created a new social contract for American capitalism: scale in exchange for transparency. Private companies were limited to 100 investors, putting a hard limit on how quickly they could grow. Any business that wanted to raise serious capital from the public had to submit itself to the new reporting laws. Over the next half century, this disclosure regime would underwrite the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in U.S. history. But it didn’t last. Beginning in the “Greed Is Good” 1980s, a wave of deregulatory reforms made it easier for private companies to raise capital. Most important was the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which allowed private funds to raise an unlimited amount of money from an unlimited number of institutional investors. The law created a loophole that effectively broke the scale-for-transparency bargain. Tellingly, 1997 was the year the number of public companies in America peaked. From the November 2018 issue: The death of the IPO “Suddenly, private companies could raise all the money they want without even thinking about an IPO,” De Fontenay said. “That completely undermined the incentives companies had to go public.” Indeed, from 1980 to 2000, an average of 310 companies went public every year; from 2001 to 2022, only 118 did. The number briefly shot up during the coronavirus pandemic but has since fallen. (Over the same time period, the rate of mergers and acquisitions soared, which also helps explain the decline in public companies.) Meanwhile, private equity has matured into a multitrillion-dollar industry, devoted to making short-term profits from highly leveraged transactions, operating with almost no regulatory or public scrutiny. Not all private-equity deals end in calamity, of course, and not all public companies are paragons of civic virtue. But the secrecy in which private-equity firms operate emboldens them to act more recklessly—and makes it much harder to hold them accountable when they do. Private-equity investment in nursing homes, to take just one example, has grown from about $5 billion at the turn of the century to more than $100 billion today. The results have not been pretty. The industry seems to have recognized that it could improve profit margins by cutting back on staffing while relying more on psychoactive medication. Stories abound of patients being rushed to the hospital after being overprescribed opioids, of bedside call buttons so poorly attended that residents suffer in silence while waiting for help, of nurses being pressured to work while sick with COVID. A 2021 study concluded that private-equity ownership was associated with about 22,500 premature nursing-home deaths from 2005 to 2017—before the wave of death and misery wrought by the pandemic. Eventually, the public got wind of what was happening. The pandemic death count focused attention on the industry. Journalists and watchdog groups exposed the worst of the behaviors. Policy makers and regulators, at long last, began to take action. But by then, much of the damage had been done. “If we had some form of disclosure, we probably would have seen regulatory action a decade earlier,” Coates told me. “But instead, we’ve had 10-plus years of experimentation and abuse without anyone knowing.” Something similar could be said about any number of industries, including higher education, newspapers, retail, and grocery stores. Across the economy, private-equity firms are known for laying off workers, evading regulations, reducing the quality of services, and bankrupting companies while ensuring that their own partners are paid handsomely. The veil of secrecy makes all of this easier to execute and harder to stop. Private-equity funds dispute many of the criticisms of the industry. They argue that the horror stories are exaggerated and that a handful of problematic firms shouldn’t tarnish the rest of the industry, which is doing great work. Freed from onerous disclosure requirements, they claim, private companies can build more dynamic, flexible businesses that generate greater returns for shareholders. But the lack of public information makes verifying these claims difficult. Most careful academic studies find that although private-equity funds slightly outperformed the stock market on average prior to the early 2000s, they no longer do so. When you take into account their high fees, they appear to be a worse investment than a simple index fund. “These companies basically get to write their own stories,” says Alyssa Giachino, the research director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They produce their own reports. They come up with their own numbers. And there’s no one making sure they are telling the truth.” In the roaring ’20s, the lack of corporate disclosure allowed a massive financial crisis to build up without anyone noticing. A century later, the growth of a new shadow economy could pose similar risks. The hallmark of a private-equity deal is the so-called leveraged buyout. Funds take on massive amounts of debt to buy companies, with the goal of reselling in a few years at a profit. If all of that debt becomes hard to pay back—because of, say, an economic downturn or rising interest rates—a wave of defaults could ripple through the financial system. In fact, this has happened before: The original leveraged buyout mania of the 1980s helped spark the 1989 stock-market crash. Since then, private equity has grown into a $12 trillion industry and has begun raising much of its money from unregulated, nonbank lenders, many of which are owned by the same private-equity funds taking out loans in the first place. Meanwhile, interest rates have reached a 20-year high, posing a direct threat to private equity’s debt-heavy business model. In response, many private-equity funds have migrated toward even riskier forms of backroom financing. Many of these involve taking on even more debt on the assumption that market conditions will soon improve enough to restore profitability. If that doesn’t happen—and many of these big deals fail—the implications could be massive. Joe Nocera and Bethany McLean: What financial engineering does to hospitals The industry counters that private markets are a better place for risky deals precisely because they have fewer ties to the real economy. A traditional bank has a bunch of ordinary depositors, whereas if a private-equity firm goes bust, the losers are institutional investors: pension funds, university endowments, wealthy fund managers. Bad, but not catastrophic. The problem, once again, is that no one knows how true that story is. Banks have to disclose information to regulators about how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. Private lenders sidestep all of that, meaning that regulators can’t know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy. “Everything could be just fine,” says Ana Arsov, a managing director at Moody’s Investors Service who leads research on private lending. “But the point is that we don’t have the information we need to assess risk. Who is making these loans? How big are they? What are the terms? We just don’t know. So the worry is that the leverage in the system might grow and grow and grow without anyone noticing. And we really don’t know what the effects could be if something goes wrong.” The government appears to be at least somewhat aware of this problem. In August, the SEC proposed a new rule requiring private-equity fund advisers to give more information to their investors. That’s better than nothing, but it hardly addresses the bad behavior or systemic risk. Nearly a century ago, Congress concluded that the nation’s economic system could not survive as long as its most powerful companies were left to operate in the shadows. It took the worst economic cataclysm in American history to learn that lesson. The question now is what it will take to learn it again.

This means that regular investors had a chance at all this growth.Newer companies like AirBNB and Uber went public at what could be their max market cap valuation of billions so investors wont&#x27; get much of a chance to make money from these companies.In addition to this problem of private investors(VC&#x27;s) taking most of the profits, we now have such concentration of wealth that the big PE firms can buy alot of what used to be small businesses and roll them up.Vet clinics, medial practices, engineering firms, etc all use to to thrive on being 20 person shops are now routinely being bought up by PE firms and rolled into larger companies which means far fewer entrepreneurs or chances for up and coming employees to buy into the firm from the founders, which helps stall careers.Heck you see it now with these firms buying up single family housing in US cities now and then renting them back to people, transforming regular middle class people from home owners to renters, and transferring the home appreciate from the middle and lower class to the PE limited partners ensuring the rich get richer and the middle class disappears even faster. reply spiralpolitik 19 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s worse than that. The 401k generation will begin think about retiring in the next few years. Most will discover that their 401K, despite maximum contributions, will be insufficient to retire on.This will either keep older workers in the workforce longer, preventing younger workers for getting into positions, or it will result in discrimination against older workers who will find themselves unable to get jobs, let go, or laid off to make room for younger, cheaper workers.The expectation for your 401k is that it&#x27;s going to grow by 6-8% each year. If there isn&#x27;t any room for growth in the market then it&#x27;s going to be hard to deliver that going forward, compounding the problem for later generations who probably won&#x27;t be inheriting anything from their parents. reply ilamont 19 hours agorootparent> despite maximum contributionsThe people with insufficient 401k balances aren&#x27;t making the max.

Even with matching contributions. Or, they don&#x27;t trust them after the 2008 collapse or a vague suspicion that the system is rigged against them. This is what I hear from my spouse; many of her colleagues won&#x27;t touch the solid 401k investments offered by their employer.Some employers have made changes that makes it easier to get started, but many never will, assuming (wrongly) that social security is their retirement solution.Your predictions about older workers working longer is correct.

The 7% average stock market return is completely irrelevant to how people actually invest. And I&#x27;m not even talking about irresponsible investing. I&#x27;m talking about allocation models (put x% of your portfolio in bonds; more when closer to retirement), and I&#x27;m especially talking about how people tend to have less money to invest when times are bad and prices are low, and more money to invest when times are good and prices are high. What use is stocks being on sale if you&#x27;ve been laid off at the same time?I think if everyone had a practice of tracking the dates and amounts of all their retirement contributions, and calculated APY from their balances, we&#x27;d be a lot closer to exposing the huge lies that are at the root of the investment advice communities.

Inflation wise, the iPhone 3GS is only marginally more expensive than the iPhone 15, while delivering far more value. I struggle to understand how ~$75&#x2F;mo for someone making 100k&#x2F;year is a deliberating expense for the purpose of wealth signaling especially when that purchase likely delivers far more than $75&#x2F;mo of actual economic value.Conversely, those 100k&#x2F;year earners are likely concentrated in some of the highest CoL areas in the country and simply wouldn&#x27;t be 100k&#x2F;yr earners in lower CoL areas. Rent and housing has continue to explode but the idea that these 100k&#x2F;yr earners are hedonists is starting to feel like a thought terminating cliche to me.The price of an iPhone has been pretty much constant for 15 years when adjusted for inflation, but 1bdr Rent (adjusted for inflation) in San Francisco is up 60% in that same time period.Lets say a 100k earner in 2009 did the responsible 30% of income on rent, and spent 2,500&#x2F;mo. A 100k&#x2F;yr earner in 2023 would be spending 4,000&#x2F;mo on a comparable apartment. They might need a roommate, or almost HALF of their income would go to rent. If Earner 1 was saving 10% of their income every month, that would be completely eaten by rent in earner (2) scenario, making them paycheck-to-paycheck.

If you do something ostensibly immoral, it&#x27;s still bad even if it&#x27;s legal. It&#x27;s still bad even if other people were going to do it if you didn&#x27;t, anyway. It&#x27;s still bad even if there&#x27;s negative incentives that ultimately led to it. It&#x27;s just still bad in general. If you have a reasonable decision and you choose to do a bad thing, you still chose to do it. It doesn&#x27;t matter either, if a single person made this decision, or if a corporate board made this decision, or if a bunch of people in an angry mob collectively decided something.What you can do is explain why it happened, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that there is absolutely zero social responsibility to have. All that something being legal means is that it&#x27;s legal. Something being legal doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s good.

There&#x27;s also a hardship waiver at the board&#x27;s discretion.The PE&#x2F;RE investment firms won&#x27;t touch units with this rule in place; a unit they can&#x27;t rent makes no revenue and is a waste of capital for them.Note that this (or any kind of arrangement meant to discourage these kinds of buyers) gets contentious when someone is selling, especially if they&#x27;re struggling to find a buyer. We recently had someone who needed to sell quickly, had interest from some kind of firm, but no offers from normal buyers (ie human people) due to the soft market.

Pensions are not optional, you can’t cash them out, you can’t take a loan, and they don’t require any logistics to maintain after you’ve moved on. The biggest flaw of 401ks is their optionality which allows present self to buy a new car making retired self homeless.You (and I) aren’t the issue here - it’s the majority of people who are unsophisticated. They are autopiloting through life, assuming social security is a retirement plan or that they’ll save later when they’re closer to retirement. This is an awful lot of people. The truth is as a society we will be carrying them in their old age because we didn’t pay up front, instead we set up an optional plan assuming they would pay up front.

As of 2016, about half of households with a worker age 55 and older had no retirement savings, and 29% had no retirement savings or a defined benefit plan.

Most will discover that their 401K, despite maximum contributions, will be insufficient to retire on.The maximum individual contribution—not counting employer contributions—is $22,500.

If You’re maxing out your 401k, you’ll pass $71k after working just a few years.To retire with just $71k after working a typical career of 40 years, you’d have to save less than ~$600&#x2F;year.

It is dead capital, as you must live somewhere. Certainly, we can include it in your estate and net worth, but that&#x27;s more pertinent to whomever is next of kin, not the person who needs cashflow for groceries, fuel, utilities, healthcare expenses, and so on. What the metrics represent is important, otherwise we are blinded to ground truth.I must strongly emphasize that vehicle equity is not retirement savings if you must keep the car for mobility. Home equity is not retirement savings if you must have a place to live and there is nowhere to downsize to, unless we are expecting 55+ to sell their homes and live in a van down by the river, burning through their housing proceeds and hopefully dying before it is exhausted. reply the_gastropod 18 hours agorootparentI think it’s still perfectly relevant. Retirees who own their homes have lower expenses than those that must pay rent. If your net worth is 100% equity in your wholly owned home, social security will go a much longer way than someone with $71k in a 401k who must still pay rent.I don’t know what point you’re trying to make here. Is US retirement a mess? Yes. But I don’t think the magnitude of bleakness is quite as high as you’re describing.While hardship exists, and I think we’d probably agree that there needs to be a much better safety net in place for people, I think it’s also true that many capable people neglect to save enough for the future. And, to be honest, I think often it’s because of rhetoric like yours. People are hopeless, and just give up trying. Reality is not that grim. Saving even $1M in a 401k over 40 years has been attainable for most people by following the boring “save 10%” strategy. reply danaris 17 hours agorootparentBut a higher net worth due to having equity in a home is not the same as having fully paid off your home. There&#x27;s just not enough information in such statistics to make such a determination one way or another.You&#x27;re welcome to assume that retirees have paid off their mortgages, but it&#x27;s a wholly unsupported assumption, given just the information in this thread.

If a retiree has a mortgage payment then that&#x27;s just one more housing expense to factor into retirement planning along with property taxes, maintenance, etc. For retirees with low interest mortgage it would be foolish to pay those off. And retirees who have substantial equity but need cash for living expenses can always take out a reverse mortgage. reply danaris 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s completely backwards.In order to determine whether you can afford to retire, you need to be looking at recurring expenses, not illiquid assets. If you have an expected monthly income from your 401k of, say, $1200, but your mortgage payment is $800&#x2F;month, it doesn&#x27;t matter that you&#x27;ve got $150k already paid into it and only another 10 years left to go; you can&#x27;t afford to retire now![0]Yes, it&#x27;s theoretically possible (depending on how much equity you actually have, and your credit score) to take out a home equity loan to provide you with money to live on in your retirement, but a) there&#x27;s interest payments to think of, which put you right back at the top of this post looking at monthly expenses, and b) if this is a significant part of your net worth (which, for many of these people, it absolutely will be), this means that at best you&#x27;re leaving your heirs with a bunch of debt and no house, and at worst the bank just won&#x27;t let you do it in the first place. And while there is certainly a perfectly reasonable discussion to be had of whether it&#x27;s better to use the money for yourself now, and not care about your family, making that selfish choice is far from universal.[0] No actual numbers were harmed in the making of this post. All numbers are entirely made up. reply nradov 13 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s completely backwards. I don&#x27;t think you understand how reverse mortgages work. It&#x27;s not the same as a home equity loan.As for leaving an estate for heirs, that&#x27;s a separate issue from retirement planning. There&#x27;s no way to leave a bunch of debt to heirs. If you die with liabilities exceeding assets then any debt which remains after selling off assets is simply defaulted. The heirs will inherit nothing of significant value, but creditors can&#x27;t force them to pay off the remaining debts either. replyryandrake 17 hours agorootparentprevI know far too many people (albeit all younger than me) who readily admit to having zero savings--retirement or otherwise.

They deliberately don&#x27;t because they want to spend today and not lock up their money for an uncertain future.

Defined contribution pensions are maybe an improvement on this because at least you know there is money there and can have a regulatory framework that is simple and heavily restricts how the money can be used. I would really like to see broad market index funds only. Dumb money should stay dumb.Maybe if you pull the responsibility up to the federal government you minimize the risk of mismanagement, but it&#x27;s still pretty large.Seems like we are doomed to pick an option that is still risky and it&#x27;s every person for themselves. You need to super save and not rely on any framework provided by others. And this is where 401ks shine. Sure I am stuck relying on the stock market, but I think the distribution of outcomes there are more in my favor than if it were managed by someone else.

The nurse is going to be on their phone most of the time, English probably isn’t their first language, and the opportunity for elder abuse is sky-high. For what they get paid after their boss takes their cut of your $100k, they will probably steal. Heck, there are often arrangements where the nursing home gets “whatever you have” when you pass away in exchange for providing care. Conflict of interest, yeah? They are incentivized to let you die where possible.I wish assisted suicide was more popular. I think it will be more popular as time goes on, especially in the US.

A multi-year zero interest bond is not a very safe investment. I did have that default setting on a retirement account and got out of those LifePath type ETFs over a decade ago. reply nradov 15 hours agorootparentYou appear to be confusing safety with investment returns. As an asset class, bonds with high credit ratings have a lower risk of losing capital than stocks. Those bonds will lose some value as interest rates rise but they very rarely go to zero. For investors approaching retirement age it&#x27;s more important to preserve capital than to worry about interest rate risks. reply gymbeaux 5 hours agorootparentNevertheless, I find target retirement date funds pull out of stocks and move to bonds way too early. I’d probably only start moving out of stocks 2-3 years before retirement, based on how long recessions&#x2F;crashes of the past lasted.Historically, it looks like the risk of being in stocks as you approach retirement is pretty low. Let’s say you planned on retiring in 2009 at age 65. 2009 hits, stocks fall 50%… if you just continued working for 2-3 more years, your retirement account would be back at fresh all time highs AND you’d be collecting a larger SS paycheck each month when you retired at 67-68. Not exactly tragic. reply njarboe 10 hours agorootparentprevTotal market index funds don&#x27;t go to zero. You would have a bond fund and stock fund and rebalance to more stocks as you get nearer retirement. Sure, but maybe not when there have been very low interest rates for a long time. Holding cash in that case seems better than bonds to me. No upside in bonds, just downside. reply nradov 8 hours agorootparentBond funds generate higher risk-adjusted returns than cash over most historical periods. You have to factor in income from coupon payments. You can cherry pick a few brief periods when this wasn&#x27;t true but no one has the ability to reliably predict when that will happen in the future so it&#x27;s a foolish approach to retirement planning. Most target date mutual funds do include some cash and equivalents in the portfolio as the target date approaches. reply gymbeaux 5 hours agorootparentPeter Lynch’s mantra is to not bother with bonds, and his arguments are compelling enough for me to only stick with low-expense-ratio index funds. replynradov 15 hours agorootparentprevMajor passive target date funds are all correctly managed.

Professionals who want out will overwhelmingly figure out how to save more, regardless of whether their investment returns are 5% or 9%. Most people are working for much more than a paycheck (though I believe they often fail to realize that), and stop working for far more varied reasons than achieving financial independence or a fully vested retirement plan.Sure, this will move some people at the margins, but most people will stop working from physical or mental frailty, to move across the country to be with grandchildren, or to preserve their limited energy to do things that they find more compelling than work. To the extent that they need to, they&#x27;ll find lower-cost ways to live, probably including down-sizing, living with their adult children, renting rooms, or other informal arrangements within their communities. reply gymbeaux 19 hours agorootparentIt’s not over-hyped. If you play around with the numbers, the ~$22k per year (increases a little each year usually) you can put in a 401k is insufficient to retire on, even if you start at age 20 and max it each year till 55… unless the stock market goes up, up, up. One flaw is that you can only contribute that $22k to retirement if you have an employer and that employer offers a 401k plan to employees. Most do, but it also discourages entrepreneurship and gig work (which can be lucrative). Without a 401k, we are limited to contributing $6k&#x2F;year to an IRA, which only has a tax deduction if you make less than $85k or so per year.Meanwhile 15% or so of our paychecks go towards social security, which many believe won’t exist in 20 years, regardless of contributions you made.Finally, the cost of retiring heavily depends on two things- healthcare and housing. Many Americans remain employed until 65 when they are eligible for Medicare as their employer-provided health insurance is all they can afford. Prior to Obamacare, these individuals would simply be uninsured, but now it’s “insured but it’s ridiculously expensive” without their employer.As for housing… it’s common to sell a single family home for X and use X&#x2F;Y of that money to buy a smaller townhome or condo to live in until the day you die. This can work out well, adding tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars to the retirement account, but it relies on the person owning the home, having significant equity in the home if it’s not fully paid off, and being willing and able to sell the house and downsize.The system is broken and in this software engineer-heavy forum, I think it’s easy to forget that we make more money than most Americans.

But having that ultra-high cost front-loaded cast like a million-plus dollar shadow on our likely at-60 savings (due to opportunity cost), not even counting the ongoing costs and the effects those are having. Retiring at 65 is now iffy… reply symlinkk 17 hours agorootparentprevNot to mention Social Security kicks in once you hit your 60s. reply Kon-Peki 17 hours agorootparentprev> discourages entrepreneurship and gig work (which can be lucrative)Self-employed folks can make both employee and employer contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, and the aggregate yearly amount far exceeds what a W-2 employee can contribute on their own. reply nradov 19 hours agorootparentprevNo one retires at age 55 unless they already have substantial wealth. The expectation is that you continue contributing until you retire at about age 67. reply renonce 17 hours agorootparentprevJust wondering, how many U.S. citizens have considered retiring in another country, possibly a developing country? I live in an Asian country where the living costs are significantly lower than that of U.S., so as long as the US dollar remains strong you can expect 2~3X more purchasing power for the same dollars. Countries like Malasyia have favorable policies for foreign retired workers, such as easy retirement visa, world-class medical care, etc. Could be an ideal place for retirement in case 401k was insufficient for retirement in US. reply trashface 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m closer to retirement than probably most people here, and I have considered it, though I haven&#x27;t specifically looked at any countries. One risk for me is the the potential for culture shock, as I haven&#x27;t ever lived outside the US (and indeed have not been outside of US in over 20 years, and when I did it was to the UK, so not exactly a big difference from US).I also have to take care of my aging parents here, by the time I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore, I could be near 60 and really not in much condition to manage a big move like that. My own retirement might be...rather short at that point; there is no one to take care of me.My brother really wants us to try for Irish citizenship (we have distant relatives so its possible while one of my parents is still alive), but its highly unlikely we&#x27;d get approved and Ireland is not cheap nowadays. I&#x27;ve looked at Canada but there is a lot of red tape for US citizens to move there, especially ones who are already partially retired. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 17 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t know why, but all those cheap countries are too hot for me. All the colder climate countries are well developed and expensive. Maybe the chain of derivation is cold -> hard to survive -> expensive -> developed. reply smabie 4 hours agorootparentHow about South Africa? reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 17 minutes agorootparentGood example to illustrate my point - coldest of the continent, best developed (still going to shit lately). reply renonce 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat about getting an air conditioner? reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 18 minutes agorootparentMeaning sitting under house arrest all the time? reply stouset 7 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s worse than that. The 401k generation will begin think about retiring in the next few years. Most will discover that their 401K, despite maximum contributions, will be insufficient to retire on.I’m sorry, are you looking at the same market graphs I’m looking at? Anyone who is retiring soon and has been maxing their 401(k) for the last decade-plus is doing pretty damn well. reply conductr 6 hours agorootparentIt’s all relative. That person is likely to need more in retirement based on their living standards reply stouset 6 hours agorootparentI’m pretty confident the majority of families that have been maxing their 401(k)s have a pretty good awareness of their retirement situation. Not a lot of people in that bracket are going to wake up one day in their sixties and suddenly realize they need to drop their standard of living if they want to make it. There’s not a lot of overlap in the Venn diagram of people who care enough to max out their retirement plans and people who don’t routinely assess their financial situation.I’d be much, much more worried about the depressingly large number of people who have next to nothing saved, who almost certainly will be surprised to learn that retirement isn’t an age, it’s a financial situation. reply latency-guy2 5 hours agorootparentprevIts not all relative, that&#x27;s an abuse of the phrase. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 17 hours agorootparentprev>> The expectation for your 401k is that it&#x27;s going to grow by 6-8% each year.I have always been suspicious of the 6-8% figure, as it also includes an unknown number of insiders. They know when to buy and when to sell, so their returns are higher than 6-8%. Correspondingly, all non-insider returns are lower, such as 3-4%, but you will not be able to tell because statistically, it will still average out to 6-8%. reply AgentOrange1234 6 hours agorootparentPerhaps the historic returns from a passively managed index fund would bypass these concerns? reply giantg2 10 hours agorootparentprevWho is actually making max contributions? $19k per year is out of reach for most. If someone makes the max 401k and IRA contributions over a 35 year career, they would be set. reply ChuckMcM 10 hours agorootparentI suspect all of the exempt employees of Meta, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Intel, and pretty much the ones in any of the other fortune 100 companies.There is a funny thing though, you can have \"too much\" in your 401k&#x2F;IRA :-). When you hit 72 you have to withdraw 10% annually and that amount can put you into the top tax bracket if you&#x27;ve been saving your whole career and have more than a million bucks in there. reply gshubert17 6 hours agorootparentRequired minimum distributions start at about 5% (not 10%) at age 72, and increase with age. But your general point stands. RMDs will add to one&#x27;s tax bill, by regular tax brackets and having up to 85% of Social Security benefits taxed too. reply oh_sigh 8 hours agorootparentprevThe good news is - if you have to take out $100k, you only need to take out $90k the next year! reply ChuckMcM 7 hours agorootparentYeah unless the market is doing well and your balance is growing. I get that it isn&#x27;t a \"problem\" per se. :-) reply alistairSH 10 hours agorootparentprevHell, even among people who should be able to contribute the max, many do not. reply mint2 19 hours agorootparentprevAlso all the older workers who do have enough used it to buy multiple investment properties, helping make house prices absurd. reply delfinom 9 hours agorootparentprevThe 401k generation is retiring right now. They peak in 5 years and end in 10.I think the guessing they&#x27;ll work longer is optimistic. Once you hit age 65 or 67 man, you&#x27;ll be surprised how much harder life is lol. At my workplace, two people retired this year and they announced their funerals within 2 weeks. That caused 5 more to finally retire before it&#x27;s err, too late.But I fully agree the 401k meme is in trouble. It&#x27;s modeled just like social security and pensions. Infinite growth, which simply does not exist. Except instead of the government footing it, we threw it into the market and allowed middlemen to also take a cut. reply oh_sigh 8 hours agorootparentprevWhat about all the 401k generation that can retire? Should we be expecting a massive sell-off of stocks held by 401k-ers? reply WalterBright 6 hours agorootparentprevThe number of workers in the economy is not zero-sum. reply bushbaba 19 hours agorootparentprevHonestly just see a lot more RV&#x2F;Van dwellers in retirement. housing and healthcare are the greatest costs. reply trashface 14 hours agorootparentThis is what I&#x27;m contemplating in the near future. My house mostly paid off, but I struggle to afford the maintenance and some stuff is starting to go seriously wrong, and younger people are moving into town with eye-popping incomes, driving up COL overall. But then I can&#x27;t afford to rent either because my income is tiny. I understand RV living has many issues but there are likely no other options for me.Its \"funny\" that I&#x27;m not that old (40s) and I&#x27;ve now lived through 2 major housing crisis as an adult. Its the same number as my parents who are in their 80s, and they never even had to buy a house in a post crisis era. Housing was basically ez-mode for them their whole lives (as was healthcare). Only now are they having any difficulty, even with a defined-benefits pension, but they have me to help out, lucky them (not so much me).As for healthcare I&#x27;ve given up on that already. I might have one elective surgery next year, after that if anything major goes wrong with me, I&#x27;m dead. Not even really bothering with many doctor visits now, though I manage the prexisting issues I know about. reply conductr 6 hours agorootparentI’m not sure about your budget&#x2F;priorities, but there’s plenty of afforda",

    "originBody": "The Grug Brained Developer A layman's guide to thinking like the self-aware smol brained Introduction this collection of thoughts on software development gathered by grug brain developer grug brain developer not so smart, but grug brain developer program many long year and learn some things although mostly still confused grug brain developer try collect learns into small, easily digestible and funny page, not only for you, the young grug, but also for him because as grug brain developer get older he forget important things, like what had for breakfast or if put pants on big brained developers are many, and some not expected to like this, make sour face THINK they are big brained developers many, many more, and more even definitely probably maybe not like this, many sour face (such is internet) (note: grug once think big brained but learn hard way) is fine! is free country sort of and end of day not really matter too much, but grug hope you fun reading and maybe learn from many, many mistake grug make over long program life The Eternal Enemy: Complexity apex predator of grug is complexity complexity bad say again: complexity very bad you say now: complexity very, very bad given choice between complexity or one on one against t-rex, grug take t-rex: at least grug see t-rex complexity is spirit demon that enter codebase through well-meaning but ultimately very clubbable non grug-brain developers and project managers who not fear complexity spirit demon or even know about sometime one day code base understandable and grug can get work done, everything good! next day impossible: complexity demon spirit has entered code and very dangerous situation! grug no able see complexity demon, but grug sense presence in code base demon complexity spirit mocking him make change here break unrelated thing there what!?! mock mock mock ha ha so funny grug love programming and not becoming shiney rock speculator like grug senior advise club not work on demon spirit complexity and bad idea actually hit developer who let spirit in with club: sometimes grug himself! sadly, often grug himself so grug say again and say often: complexity very, very bad Saying No best weapon against complexity spirit demon is magic word: \"no\" \"no, grug not build that feature\" \"no, grug not build that abstraction\" \"no, grug not put water on body every day or drink less black think juice you stop repeat ask now\" note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: \"yes\" is magic word for more shiney rock and put in charge of large tribe of developer sad but true: learn \"yes\" then learn blame other grugs when fail, ideal career advice but grug must to grug be true, and \"no\" is magic grug word. Hard say at first, especially if you nice grug and don't like disappoint people (many such grugs!) but easier over time even though shiney rock pile not as high as might otherwise be is ok: how many shiney rock grug really need anyway? Saying ok sometimes compromise necessary or no shiney rock, mean no dinosaur meat, not good, wife firmly remind grug about young grugs at home need roof, food, and so forth, no interest in complexity demon spirit rant by grug for fiftieth time in this situation, grug recommend \"ok\" \"ok, grug build that feature\" then grug spend time think of 80/20 solution to problem and build that instead. 80/20 solution say \"80 want with 20 code\" solution maybe not have all bell-whistle that project manager want, maybe a little ugly, but work and deliver most value, and keep demon complexity spirit at bay for most part to extent sometimes probably best just not tell project manager and do it 80/20 way. easier forgive than permission, project managers mind like butterfly at times overworked and dealing with many grugs. often forget what even feature supposed to do or move on or quit or get fired grug see many such cases anyway is in project managers best interest anyway so grug not to feel too bad for this approach usually Factoring Your Code next strategy very harder: break code base up properly (fancy word: \"factor your code properly\") here is hard give general advice because each system so different. however, one thing grug come to believe: not factor your application too early! early on in project everything very abstract and like water: very little solid holds for grug's struggling brain to hang on to. take time to develop \"shape\" of system and learn what even doing. grug try not to factor in early part of project and then, at some point, good cut-points emerge from code base good cut point has narrow interface with rest of system: small number of functions or abstractions that hide complexity demon internally, like trapped in crystal grug quite satisfied when complexity demon trapped properly in crystal, is best feeling to trap mortal enemy! grug try watch patiently as cut points emerge from code and slowly refactor, with code base taking shape over time along with experience. no hard/ fast rule for this: grug know cut point when grug see cut point, just take time to build skill in seeing, patience sometimes grug go too early and get abstractions wrong, so grug bias towards waiting big brain developers often not like this at all and invent many abstractions start of project grug tempted to reach for club and yell \"big brain no maintain code! big brain move on next architecture committee leave code for grug deal with!\" but grug learn control passions, major difference between grug and animal instead grug try to limit damage of big brain developer early in project by giving them thing like UML diagram (not hurt code, probably throw away anyway) or by demanding working demo tomorrow working demo especially good trick: force big brain make something to actually work to talk about and code to look at that do thing, will help big brain see reality on ground more quickly remember! big brain have big brain! need only be harness for good and not in service of spirit complexity demon on accident, many times seen (best grug brain able to herd multiple big brain in right direction and produce many complexity demon trap crystals, large shiney rock pile awaits such grug!) also sometimes call demo approach \"prototype\", sound fancier to project manager grug say prototype early in software making, especially if many big brains Testing grug have love/hate relationship with test: test save grug many, many uncountable time and grug love and respect test unfortunately also many test shamans exist. some test shaman make test idol, demand things like \"first test\" before grug even write code or have any idea what grug doing domain! how grug test what grug not even understand domain yet!? \"Oh, don't worry: the tests will show you what you need to do.\" grug once again catch grug slowly reaching for club, but grug stay calm grug instead prefer write most tests after prototype phase, when code has begun firm up but, note well: grug must here be very disciplined! easy grug to move on and not write tests because \"work on grugs machine\"! this very, very bad: no guarantee work on other machine and no guarantee work on grug machine in future, many times test shaman have good point on importance of test, even if test shaman often sometimes not complete useful feature in life and talk only about test all time, deserve of club but heart in right place also, test shaman often talk unit test very much, but grug not find so useful. grug experience that ideal tests are not unit test or either end-to-end test, but in-between test unit tests fine, ok, but break as implementation change (much compared api!) and make refactor hard and, frankly, many bugs anyway often due interactions other code. often throw away when code change. grug write unit test mostly at start of project, help get things going but not get too attached or expect value long time end to end tests good, show whole system work, but! hard to understand when break and drive grug crazy very often, sometimes grugs just end up ignoring because \"oh, that break all time\" very bad! in-between tests, grug hear shaman call \"integration tests\" sometime often with sour look on face. but grug say integration test sweet spot according to grug: high level enough test correctness of system, low level enough, with good debugger, easy to see what break grug prefer some unit tests especially at start but not 100% all code test and definitely not \"first test\". \"test along the way\" work pretty well for grug, especially as grug figure things out grug focus much ferocious integration test effort as cut point emerge and system stabilize! cut point api hopefully stable compared implementation and integration test remain valuable many long time, and easy debug also small, well curated end-to-end test suite is created to be kept working religiously on pain of clubbing. focus of important end-to-end test on most common UI features and few most important edge cases, but not too many or become impossible maintain and then ignored this ideal set of test to grug you may not like, but this peak grug testing also, grug dislike mocking in test, prefer only when absolute necessary to (rare/never) and coarse grain mocking (cut points/systems) only at that one exception \"first test\" dislike by grug: when bug found. grug always try first reproduce bug with regression test then fix bug, this case only for some reason work better Agile grug think agile not terrible, not good end of day, not worst way to organize development, maybe better than others grug supposes is fine danger, however, is agile shaman! many, many shiney rock lost to agile shaman! whenever agile project fail, agile shaman say \"you didn't do agile right!\" grug note this awfully convenient for agile shaman, ask more shiney rock better agile train young grugs on agile, danger! grug tempted reach for club when too much agile talk happen but always stay calm prototyping, tools and hiring good grugs better key to success software: agile process ok and help some but sometimes hurt taken too seriously grug say no silver club fix all software problems no matter what agile shaman say (danger!) Refactoring refactoring fine activity and often good idea, especially later in project when code firmed up however, grug note that many times in career \"refactors\" go horribly off rails and end up causing more harm than good grug not sure exactly why some refactors work well, some fail, but grug notice that larger refactor, more likely failure appear to be so grug try to keep refactors relatively small and not be \"too far out from shore\" during refactor. ideally system work entire time and each step of finish before other begin. end-to-end tests are life saver here, but often very hard understand why broke... such is refactor life. also grug notice that introducing too much abstraction often lead to refactor failure and system failure. good example was J2EE introduce, many big brain sit around thinking too much abstraction, nothing good came of it many project hurt another good example when company grug work for introduce OSGi to help manage/trap spriit complexity demon in code base. not only OSGi not help, but make complexity demon much more powerful! took multiple man year of best developers to rework as well to boot! more complex spirit and now features impossible implement! very bad! Chesterton's Fence wise grug shaman chesterton once say here exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.” many older grug learn this lesson well not start tearing code out willy nilly, no matter how ugly look grug understand all programmer platonists at some level wish music of spheres perfection in code. but danger is here, world is ugly and gronky many times and so also must code be humility not often come big brained or think big brained easily or grug even, but grug often find \"oh, grug no like look of this, grug fix\" lead many hours pain grug and no better or system worse even grug early on in career often charge into code base waving club wildly and smash up everything, learn not good grug not say no improve system ever, quite foolish, but recommend take time understand system first especially bigger system is and is respect code working today even if not perfect here tests often good hint for why fence not to be smashed! Microservices grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too seem very confusing to grug Tools grug love tool. tool and control passion what separate grug from dinosaurs! tool allow grug brain to create code that not possible otherwise by doing thinking for grug, always good relief! grug always spend time in new place learning tools around him to maximize productivity: learn tools for two weeks make development often twice faster and often have dig around ask other developers help, no docs code completion in IDE allow grug not have remembered all API, very important! java programming nearly impossible without it for grug! really make grug think some time good debugger worth weight in shiney rocks, in fact also more: when faced with bug grug would often trade all shiney rock and perhaps few children for good debugger and anyway debugger no weigh anything far as grug can tell grug always recommend new programmer learn available debugger very deeply, features like conditional break points, expression evaluation, stack navigation, etc teach new grug more about computer than university class often! grug say never be not improving tooling Type Systems grug very like type systems make programming easier. for grug, type systems most value when grug hit dot on keyboard and list of things grug can do pop up magic. this 90% of value of type system or more to grug big brain type system shaman often say type correctness main point type system, but grug note some big brain type system shaman not often ship code. grug suppose code never shipped is correct, in some sense, but not really what grug mean when say correct grug say tool magic pop up of what can do and complete of code major most benefit of type system, correctness also good but not so nearly so much also, often sometimes caution beware big brains here! some type big brain think in type systems and talk in lemmas, potential danger! danger abstraction too high, big brain type system code become astral projection of platonic generic turing model of computation into code base. grug confused and agree some level very elegant but also very hard do anything like record number of club inventory for Grug Inc. task at hand generics especially dangerous here, grug try limit generics to container classes for most part where most value add temptation generics very large is trick! spirit demon complex love this one trick! beware! always most value type system come: hit dot see what grug can do, never forget! Expression Complexity grug once like to minimize lines of code much as possible. write code like this: if(contact && !contact.isActive() && (contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS))) { // ... } over time grug learn this hard debug, learn prefer write like so: if(contact) { var contactIsInactive = !contact.isActive(); var contactIsFamilyOrFriends = contact.inGroup(FAMILY) || contact.inGroup(FRIENDS); if(contactIsInactive && contactIsFamilyOrFriends) { // ... } } grug hear screams from young grugs at horror of many line of code and pointless variable and grug prepare defend self with club club fight start with other developers attack and grug yell: \"easier debug! see result of each expression more clearly and good name! easier understand conditional expression! EASIER DEBUG!\" definitely easier debug and once club fight end calm down and young grug think a bit, they realize grug right grug still catch grug writing code like first example and often regret, so grug not judge young grug DRY DRY mean Don't Repeat Self, powerful maxim over mind of most developers grug respect DRY and good advice, however grug recommend balance in all things, as gruggest big brain aristotle recommend grug note humourous graph by Lea Verou correspond with grug passion not repeat: over time past ten years program grug not as concerned repeat code. so long as repeat code simple enough and obvious enough, and grug begin feel repeat/copy paste code with small variation is better than many callback/closures passed arguments or elaborate object model: too hard complex for too little benefit at times hard balance here, repeat code always still make grug stare and say \"mmm\" often, but experience show repeat code sometimes often better than complex DRY solution note well! grug encourage over literal developer not take does work line too serious, is joke Separation of Concerns (SoC) Separation of Concern (SoC) another powerful idea over many developer mind, idea to separate different aspects of system into distinct sections code canonical example from web development: separation of style (css file), markup (html file) and logic (javascript file) here grug much more sour faced than DRY and in fact write big brained essay on alternative design principle locality of behavior (LoB) against SoC grug much prefer put code on the thing that do the thing. now when grug look at the thing grug know the thing what the thing do, alwasy good relief! when separate of concern grug must often all over tarnation many file look understand what how button do, much confuse and time waste: bad! Closures grug like closures for right job and that job usually abstracting operation over collection of objects grug warn closures like salt, type systems and generics: small amount go long way, but easy spoil things too much use give heart attack javascript developers call very special complexity demon spirit in javascript \"callback hell\" because too much closure used by javascript libraries very sad but also javascript developer get what deserved let grug be frank Logging grug huge fan of logging and encourage lots of it, especially in cloud deployed. some non-grugs say logging expensive and not important. grug used think this way no more funny story: grug learn idol rob pike working on logging at google and decide: \"if rob pike working on logging, what grug do there?!?\" so not pursue. turn out logging very important to google so of course best programmer work on it, grug! don't be such grug brain, grug, much less shiney rock now! oh well, grug end up at good company anyway and rob pike dress habit increasingly erratic, so all work out in end, but point stand: logging very important! grug tips on logging are: log all major logical branches within code (if/for) if \"request\" span multiple machine in cloud infrastructure, include request ID in all so logs can be grouped if possible make log level dynamically controlled, so grug can turn on/off when need debug issue (many!) if possible make log level per user, so can debug specific user issue last two points are especially handy club when fighting bugs in production systems very often unfortunately log libraries often very complex (java, why you do?) but worth investing time in getting logging infrastructure \"just right\" pay off big later in grug experience logging need taught more in schools, grug think Concurrency grug, like all sane developer, fear concurrency as much as possible, grug try to rely on simple concurrency models like stateless web request handlers and simple remote job worker queues where jobs no interdepend and simple api optimistic concurrency seem work well for web stuff occasionally grug reach for thread local variable, usually when writing framework code some language have good concurrent data structure, like java ConcurrentHashMap but still need careful grug work to get right grug has never used erlang, hear good things, but language look wierd to grug sorry Optimizing ultra biggest of brain developer once say: premature optimization is the root of all evil this everyone mostly know and grug in humble violent agreement with ultra biggest of big brain grug recommend always to have concrete, real world perf profile showing specific perf issue before begin optimizing. never know what actual issue might be, grug often surprise! very often! beware only cpu focus: easy to see cpu and much big o notation thinking having been done in school, but often not root of all slowness, surprise to many including grug hitting network equivalent of many, many millions cpu cycle and always to be minimized if possible, note well big brain microservice developer! inexperienced big brain developer see nested loop and often say \"O(n^2)?

It takes years to learn to fight the urge to over-engineer.Once you learn to see it though, it&#x27;s hard to ignore. Now I can tell instantly if code is over-engineered. Unfortunately It seems like maybe 99% of code is over-engineered. The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forces. Even developers who appear to be totally robotic and ego-less are often guilty of over-engineering. It works on the subconscious mind. Few are ever able to escape the mindset because they are not fully conscious. They are not thinking about every single line of code that they write. They decide on some goal and then churn out whatever code first pops into their heads to get incrementally closer to that goal... Not realising that, at each step, there were many alternative paths that which were superior. reply sanitycheck 5 minutes agoparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s lock-in or billable hours. I think \"staying current and employable\" is a much bigger influence on behaviour than either of those.Also, I think most developers just don&#x27;t want to do the same thing twice. And most developers really are writing the same software over and over again through their careers, with minor changes. So they need to change something to keep it interesting, and the only things they can easily change are technology and methodology. reply Trasmatta 10 hours agoparentprev> The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forces.In my experience these are rarely, if ever, the reasons for over engineering. reply lawn 3 hours agorootparentMy hobby projects are always over-engineered despite my best efforts. There&#x27;s absolutely no monetary incentives here so anecdotally I agree with you. reply Defletter 2 hours agorootparentYup, but it goes both ways. I end up over-eningeering as some feeble attempt to avoid technical debt, only to realise my over-eningeering &#x2F;is&#x2F; the technical debt. Or I end up with relatively simplistic &#x2F; specialised code that needs an entire rewrite and migration process any time something is added. Either way, it&#x27;s a bunch of rewritten code mixed with paralysing anxiety about writing bad code. reply bjornsing 30 minutes agorootparentprevYou’re just practicing in your spare time, so your subconscious knows what to do when it gets to work on Monday. ;P reply danjac 2 hours agorootparentprevMy tendency now is to aim for over-simplicity in hobby projects. I already have to deal with over-engineered garbage at work I have no choice but to accept, so I don&#x27;t want to bring those headaches home. reply jongjong 2 hours agorootparentprevI also did a lot of hobby projects and open source work. Still, in my early career, I was over-engineering everything including my own hobby projects. I think I was trying to put my signature on the work and I unwittingly achieved this through unnecessary complexity.I was thinking of good code as something I had to invent, but now I feel like it&#x27;s more like something I have to discover. reply neilv 6 hours agorootparentprevLock-in factor and billable hours can be motivations for contractors.But, for contemporary software developers in general, I&#x27;d guess more often it&#x27;s either resume-driven development (e.g., add the big complex new framework keyword to your resume) or not yet having enough experience to know what complexity is worthwhile for a situation. reply adonovan 6 hours agorootparentIn my experience most over-engineering can be explained by a lack of understanding. When we design it, we don&#x27;t know what matters and our guesses are wrong; and when we modify it later, we don&#x27;t have time to figure out how it really works. Both of those problems can be fixed by simply spending more time to understand, but time is money. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 3 hours agorootparentNot a lack of understanding, a misalignment of values.I had a team once implement the MediatR pattern for athey were convinced that sort of flexibility was a good idea.Believing flexibility is needed still suggests a lack of understanding. reply Terr_ 26 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;ve often say \"design for deletion\": Most of those long-term \"flexibility someday\" needs are best-met by making sure the inflexible modules or flows can be clearly identified and ripped out for replacement.This leads to a certain kind of decoupling, although with a higher tolerance for coupling that can kept in check by static analysis. reply j4yav 3 hours agorootparentprevI think, related, is the hope that switching to a new framework will somehow solve everything annoying about the old stack, and let you undo past mistakes. In reality, though, if you&#x27;re lucky enough not to end up supporting two stacks at once for a long time, you end up making lots of new mistakes again. reply JauntyHatAngle 6 hours agorootparentprevI never though so either, but then I worked at a place that had a stale product, product teams powerless and developers rejecting most features&#x2F;writing random code all the time.It took me a month to realise that the staff developers very much revelled in and protected their bad code and bizarre domain choices.It was so far gone that there was no way to get rid of them and the product was just slowly dying and burning the remaining cash.Then the mergers happened and they all got let go, only retaining the name for brand power and the entire stack was quietly moved over to another similar product which was rebranded.Separately, there were absolutely very large consultancies that had a programming style&#x2F;rules based on making their implementations difficult to read&#x2F;modify, needing to call their COE back in to fix their code or add features - with it being very hard to modify. Talking entire codebase structured with ridiculous levels of abstraction and annoying code style. Bad integrations requiring their tooling to work and make sense of etc.They target traditional orgs where the management just wants to get a project through and then bleed them over years. reply whatshisface 4 hours agorootparent>It took me a month to realize that the staff developers very much reveled in and protected their bad code and bizarre domain choices.I think personality can account for this without any reference to incentives, which come in to explain how this personality problem can be so common among successful engineers. reply jauntywundrkind 5 hours agorootparentprevToday&#x27;s best post on complexity to me was the I accidentally saved my company half a million dollars, which is a story filled yes with a lot of poor developers but much much worse is a story filled with Conway&#x27;s Law style lessons. Of madcap organizations & wild legacy systems that we live atop & typically just have to make do with. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38069710 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ludic.mataroa.blog&#x2F;blog&#x2F;i-accidentally-saved-half-a-...So much of the grug-brained argumentation is same-side violence, is developers roasting developers. Assigning bad motives & declaring immoral bad people among us probably takes already same-side disdain & amplifies it, forments real & powerful hatred. Yes, various petty or criminal over engineering happens some, yes. But I usually think there are simpler Hanlon&#x27;s Razor explanations that aren&#x27;t even the individual&#x27;s fault, are just the story of an org: an organizational body where so many constituent members of the body-whole have so little idea what others are doing or have done, and access to so few who can offer informed situational-appropriate wisdom for whatever dark end a squad finds itself tasked with.In some ways, this has been the actual story of open source. We have not been end user facing. We have grow communities of practitioners with individual knowledge & experience that ports & can be compared & discussed with others, from outside our company. We get peership that companies can rarely afford or find after they grow mid-sized.The Influx folks just talked about their 3.0, & replacing their custom built engine with Flight, DataFusion, Arrow, and Parquet. Maybe they might miss one box or two on neat nitty gritty optimizations (maybe this guy elsewhere in this thread, insisting on diy&#x27;ing binary encodings because protobuf doesn&#x27;t have 16-bit ints can find some deficiencies, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38078133), but the nice to haves of ecosystem integration seems like an intangible, but one that lets little good things out there plug in & help out, and that seems invaluable. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38013714 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.influxdata.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;flight-datafusion-arrow-parq...The top comment to me epitomizes the worst of grug brainedness. It&#x27;s smug & certain of itself, a strong & divisive Hanlon&#x27;s violation of high degree. That kind of blue-on-blue attitude to me is far worse than 99% of the people who end up over engineering. Few organizations have real defense, lack coherency, to help themselves away from complexity, or they have such tight constraints that they overprune & disaffect those who do care and have good ideas. These are organizational issues, and having an org that can somehow see itself & what&#x27;s afoot is the huge challenge. Stop hating on devs, please. reply josephg 10 hours agoparentprevI struggle with this constantly. I think there are two problems:1. I like interesting puzzles. A lot of code - especially commercial code - is pretty boring if you do it right. I find myself subconsciously pushing for features that will be fun to implement. And by \"fun\", I mean, features that will overcomplicate everything.2. While I&#x27;m in the middle of programming something, all the choices that I make seem straightforward and necessary. Its only later when I step away from my code and then try to understand it with fresh eyes do I notice what a mess I&#x27;ve made of everything.I also think that a lot of the time the most obvious solution to most problems is quite complex. It takes wisdom, skill and domain knowledge to know where to look for simple solutions to any given problem. Simple, clean solutions are rarely obvious.\"Oh, it looks like we&#x27;re slowly implementing a halfbaked message queue. Lets use a standard message queue instead.\" \"Oh, we&#x27;re slowly building up a custom, buggy, binary framing protocol. Lets just use protobuf&#x2F;msgpack\". \"How about instead of writing a custom RPC protocol to fetch data, we just use REST over HTTP. And then we can put nginx in the middle to cache our backend responses, and we can throw out our custom cache.\" reply eldavido 10 hours agorootparentThis is it. There&#x27;s real skill in creating simple solutions to complex problems. Knowing the general landscape of what&#x27;s out there, and easily available off the shelf, really does help.Developers grow. It starts with simple code that doesn&#x27;t work. The next step is, complicated code that solves the problem, in messy unmaintainable ways. The next step is writing super clean, almost boring code, that&#x27;s highly readable and \"dumb\" and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.The other thing to realize, a lot of great code doesn&#x27;t just spring from the developer&#x27;s hands in its final form -- it&#x27;s extensively edited and rewritten into its final, good, form. reply JadeNB 10 hours agorootparent> There&#x27;s real skill in creating simple solutions to complex problems.Not entirely facetiously, I think that, for engineers, there&#x27;s real skill in creating simple solutions to simple problems—not, for example, finding the general instance of the problem and solving that, when the problem is unlikely to recur and crafting the perfect general solution delays delivery on what&#x27;s actually in front of you.(I know Perl&#x27;s not fashionable any more, but I&#x27;ve always liked its design philosophy of \"make easy things easy, and hard things possible.\" It seems like a slogan that can be adaptable to how to solve problems, though I&#x27;m not sure of the absolutely perfect analogue. Hmm, maybe I&#x27;m trying to solve the general instance of a problem ….) reply fiddlerwoaroof 8 hours agorootparentI actually think this is the opposite of the case, for some definition of “generic”: the more generic problem has fewer possible solutions (there is only one pure function of type x=>x) so, if you hit on the right general problem to solve, your code will almost always be simpler. The problem is this is one of those “$1 to solve the problem&#x2F;$99 to know which problem to solve” situations. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 2 hours agorootparentgeneric is being used in two different ways.1. linked list is a generic data structure with a relatively simple interface2. an application with 1k configuration values is generic in that it can handle everything, but is in no way simple. reply JadeNB 8 hours agorootparentprev> I actually think this is the opposite of the case, for some definition of “generic”: the more generic problem has fewer possible solutions (there is only one pure function of type x=>x) so, if you hit on the right general problem to solve, your code will almost always be simpler. The problem is this is one of those “$1 to solve the problem&#x2F;$99 to know which problem to solve” situations.This is true, but I think also illustrates the phenomenon. It&#x27;s tempting not to solve the specific problem in front of you, because a more general problem might be easier and more elegant to solve—and this mindset can easily lead one into, at worst, never solving the real problem; or, at less worst, solving a problem that&#x27;s so far generalized that no one else looking at your code can tell why it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s doing.(It can also happen that the more general problem doesn&#x27;t have a simpler solution. If I want to print a string that has a few hard-coded values in it, formatted a particular way, I could develop a formatting spec and write a formatting library to process it, which is surely the right solution to the general problem—but, if the specific problem is likely only going to arise once, then it may be both easier to understand and a better use of time just to put in the hard-coded values.) reply jowea 8 hours agorootparentprev> 1.

Lets just use protobuf&#x2F;msgpack\"By using protobuf&#x2F;msgpack you lose the ability to precisely control the layout and encoding of your data on the wire. Most applications don&#x27;t care, but this results in your wire representation being defined by \"whatever protobuf says\".Say I want to transmit an unsigned 16 bit integer with protobuf. How do I do that? The documentation doesn&#x27;t include 16 bit integers as a datatype, so I&#x27;d probably have to wrap it in 32 bits and&#x2F;or use some varint stuff. It would be simpler to just write a big endian 16 bit int though.I wish there was a simpler alternative to protobuf that gives more control to end users and doesn&#x27;t try to be smart. Until then, making your own binary protocol is not over-engineering. reply erik_seaberg 7 hours agorootparentIt might be different if you have to talk to an ASIC that cannot understand protobuf, or send billions of values at line speed. But generally I don’t have to care anymore whether a number is sent in exactly sixteen bits, for the same reason I long since stopped caring about message framing or parity or run-length limits or 0-5 vs ±12 V busses. Expressing any of those constraints takes more effort than letting the machine use the commonly-supported default.If I really wanted to squeeze out bloat, I’d try to use https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ASN.1#Example_encoded_in_PER_%... (which has a paid standard, but isn’t well known) before resorting to a completely ad hoc protocol. reply qweqwe14 5 hours agorootparentIt wouldn&#x27;t be ad hoc per se, basically you would have a set of guidelines on how to transmit data and that by itself would be a standard.Something like \"use fixed length 8&#x2F;16&#x2F;32&#x2F;64 bit signed&#x2F;unsigned integers in big endian, length prefix can be 8&#x2F;16&#x2F;32 bits, bool is 1 byte (00 = false, 01 = true)\" etc, without extra stuff like varints or bit packing, which a lot of current formats are doing.In short, just use the most straightforward way of encoding while also using the least amount of data. Big endian for ints is very common, simple and relatively compact if you only use the bit width that you need. reply Willish42 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m reminded of that one quote from a letter of some author [paraphrasing, and I&#x27;ve seen it (mis-)attributed to Mark Twain and too many people to look the real quote up] \"Apologies for the length, I did not have time to write a shorter letter\".EDIT: I ironically wrote way too long here. Grug say better:> note, this good engineering advice but bad career advice: \"yes\" is magic word for more shiney rock and put in charge of large tribe of developerPeople can write perfect, simple, DRY code if they have the time to and are incentivized to. In most cases you&#x27;re rewarded for launching the thing and showing one&#x27;s \"technical prowess\" with the amount of work &#x2F; intellect &#x2F; design skillz™ required to launch the thing. The natural conclusion of this is that everything becomes a bloated, over-engineered mess of kludge solutions that gets rewritten every 3-7 years.I haven&#x27;t seen any data on this but I&#x27;d guess the \"rewrite half life\" is correlated with turnover &#x2F; average tenure, so even if people tried harder to write not-over-engineered code, it&#x27;d probably get rewritten anyway. As a perfectionist, this truly bothers me, but I find sometimes thinking harder &#x2F; spending more time on the best _simple_ solution is rewarded less than building the complicated overengineered thing. I&#x27;m sure better organizations exist but I have yet to find one in 9 years as a SWE...Open Source projects are actually the best counter-example to this that I can think of, but even then the best libraries sometimes get rewrites or new versions when they&#x27;ve changed hands from one maintainer to another, and I&#x27;ll note that financial incentives are very different between open source and the types of enterprise-y cruft most people working full time as SWEs on HN probably see. It&#x27;s like comparing a well crafted academic paper to a lazily written work email. reply bluefirebrand 8 hours agorootparent> People can write perfect, simple, DRY code if they have the time to and are incentivized to.In my experience, people trying to make code DRY also wind up writing over-complicated patterns and abstractions to make it so.I think a large amount of over-engineering is likely due to people applying patterns where they don&#x27;t need to, or building unnecessary abstractions, or otherwise doing what they think is \"good code\". reply bjornsing 25 minutes agoparentprev> The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forces.

They&#x27;re not much beyond mediocre, but see overcomplicating things (which in many cases they will dogmatically explain away as being a \"best practice\") as a way to make it appear like they&#x27;re smart.The smartest are those who can make complex problems look simple, with simple solutions. reply darkerside 4 hours agorootparentAnd they&#x27;re never really appreciated, since those problems end up looking so simple in hindsight reply maccard 1 hour agorootparentDisagree. When you look at a \"less is more\" engineer next to a \"I need to solve the general case with the perfect API and refactor the foobar\" after 6-12 months you&#x27;ll notice that the former has a clear pattern of delivering, and the latter... usually doesn&#x27;t. reply throwawaaarrgh 9 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s no point in going crazy trying to make the perfect code. It just needs to be good enough for its purpose. Usually it is.The problem isn&#x27;t usually the code, it&#x27;s the people in charge not giving the right instructions, shifting the goal post, allowing feature creep, or the deadly sins of rewrites, large refactors, unrealistic deadlines.Over-engineering is just fine in the real world. The problem is when that causes cost and deadline overruns. Those can be controlled for, even if the complexity can&#x27;t. But finding a manager who knows how to manage software teams effectively and simultaneously keep his bosses from digging their own graves is even rarer than an engineer who writes simple code. reply notpachet 9 hours agoparentprev> Few are ever able to escape the mindset because they are not fully conscious.No one can, and no one is. All lines of code are over-engineered, just some more so. No amount of thought will get you to the perfect solution; it&#x27;s an unapproachable asymptote. We&#x27;re all creatures of time and there&#x27;s a limit to how many cycles we can afford to spend iterating in design space to try and hit the right note.

If you need to build a feature X, and you engineer the bare minimum and need to put in the same amount of hours to do X+1, your management is going to be upset that you&#x27;re taking too long to ship. You already had it 80% (in terms of feature complete) of the way there, why is that extra 20% as hard as the first 80%? So the engineers build up scar tissue. If you have to handle a ton of cases that you don&#x27;t understand, why not build a CaseHandlerFactory so you can add the next feature faster?A clear roadmap of \"this is what we want in 1 year\" will help solve over engineering. Otherwise engineers are incentivized to make their code as configurable, modifiable, and extendable, as possible, regardless of cost or business need. Not to mention all the additional time trying to figure out \"canonical\" data models that will \"future-proof\" the applications interfaces. If you have to iterate quickly (which is not as common as agile folks wish), you need to build up a raport with leadership to help them understand that speed comes with trade offs: faster might mean &#x27;more work to change later&#x27;, while slower to market today might mean faster iteration down the line. These discussions ARE valuable for leadership, as sometimes they need a quick win because of a Q3 earnings hole or contract, and sometimes they are willing to make longer term investments.You move too quickly, they call your solutions hacky, you move too slowly, they call it overengineered. Everyone needs to be on the same page of what the change is trying to do: win short term, win long term, or somewhere in the middle. reply Kamq 5 hours agorootparent> Otherwise engineers are incentivized to make their code as configurable, modifiable, and extendable, as possible, regardless of cost or business need. Not to mention all the additional time trying to figure out \"canonical\" data models that will \"future-proof\" the applications interfaces.I&#x27;ve never understood this, maybe I&#x27;m just a bad engineer. I mean, it sucks having to pivot, but all those configurable and extendable pieces take hours trying to get the design right. And you only end up using ~1% of them, and then something you didn&#x27;t foresee happens as well. I always end up spending months of my life saving days doing the change-overs.And that&#x27;s before we get into the problems with onboarding a new engineer (or being the one onboarded) into the kind of hellscape that the overly configurable application turns into. reply Barrin92 10 hours agoparentprev>They are not thinking about every single line of code that they writeHonestly for me over-engineering is usually the result of the opposite. Thinking too much when writing and having preconceived ideas about what a codebase ought to look like.It was Casey from Handmade Hero IIRC who called his style of programming \"compression based\", effectively just writing code and factoring out what belongs together incrementally. Abstracting things out as they repeat, not consciously by design. I&#x27;ve taken this up more and more as a way to program. reply buzziebee 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve heard it described as WET.

As long as it&#x27;s not a crazy amount of duplication or a really obvious refactor (especially if it leads to more readable code), writing something a second time will start to show a clear pattern and abstractions will naturally develop.Some fellow devs seem to live creating big beastly complex abstract PatternFactoryClassBuilderGenerators for simple one off use cases which should be quite simple.Having devs and PMs on board with adding estimations and spending the time actually doing that refactor on the second or third time you&#x27;re following a pattern is the tricky bit. It pays dividends long term though as you maintain velocity. reply Trasmatta 10 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. Over engineering happens when you overthink every line of code, not when you fail to think about every line. reply devjab 4 hours agoparentprevI’m Danish so my opinion on this will be coloured by the fact that most developers here have a form of formal CS education. But we teach people to overthink and abstract things. So so think that it’s only natural that people are actually going to do exactly what they’ve been taught.I have a side-gig as an external examiner for CS students, and well, a lot of the stuff we grade our students on are things that I’ve had to “unlearn” myself throughout my career, because usually complexity and abstraction aren’t going to work out over a long period of time for an IT system. This obviously isn’t something that’s universally true. I do tend to work in non-tech enterprise organisations (or startups transitioning into enterprise) and in this space a lot of what is considered good computer science just doesn’t work. It’s everything from AGILE, where you project processes will trip you over as you try to juggle developers who both need to build and maintain things at the same time. To how we try to handle complexity with abstractions, and how those abstractions sometimes lead to “generic” functions where you need to tell a function 9001 different things before it knows how to perform “because it just evolved”. It’s in everything really, like, we teach students to decouple their architecture and it’s absolutely a good thing to teach CS students, but the result is that a lot of them “overengineer” their architecture so that you can easily swap which database your system is using (and similar) in a world where I’ve never actually seen anyone do that. Anecdotal, sure, but I did work in the public sector where we bought more than 300 different systems from basically every professional supplier in our country, and you’re frankly far more likely to simply replace the entire system than just parts of it.But how are you going to know that when all you’ve been taught is the “academic” approach to computer science by teachers who might have never experienced the real world? Being self-taught isn’t really going to help you either. I can’t imagine how you would even begin to learn good practices in the ocean of “how to” tutorials and books which are essentially little more than the official documentation on a language and maybe a couple of frameworks.> The developer&#x27;s incentive to maximize their own lock-in factor and billable hours are powerful forcesThis part, however, I disagree with. Again this is very likely coloured by the fact that I’ve mainly worked in the space where developers both build and maintain multiple things, often at the same time. But I’ve never met developers who wanted to do this. In fact I only meet developers who genuinely want their code to be as easily maintainable by others as possible because we all absolutely hate breaking off from actual development to fix a problem. That being said, I do think there is a natural risk of ending there accidentally if you haven’t “unlearned” a lot of the academic CS practices you’ve been taught. Especially because there is a very good chance you didn’t really “learn them right”. reply barrysteve 2 hours agoparentprevElectronics can absorb superhuman levels of code complexity, without protest or guardrails.At least STEM subjects are tested against repeatable natural phenomena or mathematic validation.A CPU is indifferent to you complexifying yourself, ad infinitum.

Engineers just love puzzles. I&#x27;m also looking at you, Rustaceans...runs for his life reply rebeccaskinner 4 hours agorootparentI’ve seen some variation of this accusation being thrown around for years- and frequently by people who I regard as smart, capable developers. On the other hand, having worked with languages all over the spectrum of static typing- I’ve also seen first how how high the bar really is for benefiting from static types before you hit diminishing returns.The best answer I can come up with is that people just seem to have differently wired brains. For me, static typing- even fairly sophisticated static typing, is simple. It makes the code simpler, easier to reason about, easier to refactor, and with a sufficiently expressive type system it lets you build things in a much more intuitive way than you could otherwise. It’s not about solving puzzles for the sake of them- types remove a big part of the puzzle by letting me explicitly write things down- and letting the compiler keep track of the details.Certainly plenty of people don’t see it that way, and I’ve heard a lot of people make similar arguments about dynamic typing being simpler and more expressive. I don’t think they are lying but I see a big pile of inscrutable pain when I work in large dynamically types codebases.I know I’m right about my experience, and I trust other people are right about theirs, so there must be some significant divide in how we conceptualize code that makes one persons elegant simplicity another’s intolerable complexity. reply cjfd 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is a very simplistic approach to simplicity. Simplicity is not just counting the number of characters you see. A function in a statically typed language may have a signature that says &#x27;it takes an integer and returns an integer&#x27;. That is very simple. A function in a dynamically type language says &#x27;this can take something, anything really, and returns something, anything, really. That is very complicated and unspecified even if it takes a few characters less to type. reply lucasyvas 7 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t agree with this - types do not imply abstractions, and simple types make simple code.Every tool has the potential to be misused in accidental complexity. reply jakelazaroff 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know, man — I see a lot of TypeScript developers who lean hard into generics (I am occasionally one of them). reply sanitycheck 11 minutes agorootparentWhen I&#x27;ve seen this (and found myself doing it) it&#x27;s been because we&#x27;re trying to do something with TS which we would have done easily in JS.But the JS function we would have written would have required someone using it to read and understand it, and the TS function (without using &#x27;any&#x27;) needs to fully express what its inputs and outputs can look like.Because of this TS actually tends to guide me towards writing more \"Grug brained\" code, because I refuse to use &#x27;any&#x27; (and throw away TS benefits) and using generics usually requires a trip downstairs for a fresh cup of tea. reply mordae 2 hours agorootparentprevBecause generics are actually a powerful tool for simplifying the data flow.

And you always need more nuanced behavior, this is the inherent nature of software development. Sometimes the appearance of simplicity is achieved by making the behavior simpler (e.g. dropping the support for old versions, not implementing parts of the specification, and so on). This is degradation, not simplicity. The right simplicity is an art of having the required complexity yet somehow manage it internally. So complexity is not bad. It is given.

IIRC, the official recommendation is that native clients should parse HTML for values.- HTMX is still just a javascript library dependency with syntax that must be learned by whoever picks up the project.IMO HTMX&#x27;s buzz can largely be attributed to anti-frontend or anti modern frontend.This thread describes this idea: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DanaWoodman&#x2F;status&#x2F;1682075711266496512 reply ColonelPhantom 4 minutes agorootparentWhy would I write my own JS when \"hx-get\" does the job? Writing your own JS makes sense in some cases, but using HTML partials is also useful in many cases where you need to talk to the server anyways (since they e.g. prevent logic duplication). HTMX just makes it easy to work with them, as they&#x27;re a single attribute away, rather than doing the request and insertion by hand.Native clients are deliberately out of scope, but scraping HTML isn&#x27;t the suggested solution. Rather, it is having a JSON API next to the hypermedia API: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;htmx.org&#x2F;essays&#x2F;splitting-your-apis&#x2F;. This does have the downside of duplicate work, but does bring stability to the API without introducing something like GraphQL.And yes, you will need to learn HTMX to use HTMX. But the surface of HTMX is generally quite small, and composes well with knowledge about HTML&#x2F;CSS. reply gemstones 2 hours agorootparentprevThe best critique of HTMX is the same critique of Rails + partials + a bit of helper JS for inserts (the popular stack that predates modern SPAs.)Say you’re writing a true web app. You’re making a mobile view, and the user has scrolled down and loaded some items (and partially inserted them as the scroll bar has moved down.) They add a card representing a few items to a cart, which 1. changes the look of the card and 2. the number that floats above the cart icon in the header.Do you1. Return the updated card and insert it as normal, then pass the HTML to figure out the number to change the cart icon with and call JS to change that icon?2. Trigger a full page reload, meaning that both items update at the cost of losing the scroll position?3. Break convention with HTMX and call a JSON API that will let you return the updates primitive values, and maintain the display logic changes in JS?4.

Grug presents it as \"oh I&#x27;m just dumb grug brain, I dunno\" but in practice there is a lot of infighting in tech, and those who insist too loudly on aiming too high are not even IMHO as dangerous as those too loudly insisting on too low.

    "title": "The costs of microservices (2020)",
    "originLink": "https://robertovitillo.com/costs-of-microservices/",
    "originBody": "Home About My Book The costs of microservices November 22, 2020 An application typically starts its life as a monolith. Take a modern backend of a single-page Javascript application, for example - it starts out as a single stateless web service that exposes a RESTful HTTP API and uses a relational database as a backing store. The service is composed of a number of components, or libraries, that implement different business capabilities: As the number of feature teams contributing to the same codebase increases, its components become increasingly coupled over time. This leads the teams to step on each other’s toes more and more frequently, decreasing their productivity. The codebase becomes complex enough that nobody fully understands every part of it, and implementing new features or fixing bugs becomes time-consuming. Even if the backend is componentized into different libraries owned by different teams, a change to a library requires the service to be redeployed. And if a change introduces a bug - like a memory leak - the entire service can potentially be affected by it. Additionally, rolling back a faulty build affects the velocity of all teams, not just the one that introduced the bug. One way to mitigate the growing pains of a monolithic backend is to split it into a set of independently deployable services that communicate via APIs. The APIs decouple the services from each other by creating boundaries that are hard to violate, unlike the ones between components running in the same process: This architectural style is also referred to as the microservice architecture. The term micro can be misleading, though - there doesn’t have to be anything micro about the services. In fact, I would argue that if a service doesn’t do much, it just creates more operational toll than benefits. A more appropriate name for this architecture is service-oriented architecture, but unfortunately, that name comes with some old baggage as well. Perhaps in 10 years, we will call the same concept with yet another name, but for now we will have to stick to microservices. Breaking down the backend by business capabilities into a set of services with well-defined boundaries allows each service to be developed and operated by a single small team. The reduced team size increases the application’s development speed for a variety of reasons: Smaller teams are more effective as the communication overhead grows quadratically with the team’s size. As each team dictates its own release schedule and has complete control over its codebase, less cross-team communication is required, and therefore decisions can be taken in less time. The codebase of a service is smaller and easier to digest by its developers, reducing the time it takes to ramp up new hires. Also, a smaller codebase doesn’t slow down IDEs, which makes the developers more productive. The boundaries between services are much stronger than the boundaries between components in the same process. Because of that, when a developer needs to change a part of the backend, they only need to understand a small part of the whole. Each service can be scaled independently and adopt a different technology stack based on its own needs. The consumers of the APIs don’t care how the functionality is implemented after all. This makes it easy to experiment and evaluate new technologies without affecting other parts of the system. Each microservice can have its own independent data model and data store(s) that best fit its use-cases, allowing developers to change its schema without affecting other services. Costs The microservices architecture adds more moving parts to the overall system, and this doesn’t come for free. The cost of fully embracing microservices is only worth paying if it can be amortized across dozens of development teams. Development Experience Nothing forbids the use of different languages, libraries, and datastores for each microservice - but doing so transforms the application into an unmaintainable mess. For example, it makes it more challenging for a developer to move from one team to another if the software stack is completely different. And think of the sheer number of libraries - one for each language adopted - that need to be supported to provide common functionality that all services need, like logging. It’s only reasonable then that a certain degree of standardization is needed. One way to do that - while still allowing some degree of freedom - is to loosely encourage specific technologies by providing a great development experience for the teams that stick with the recommended portfolio of languages and technologies. Resource Provisioning To support a large number of independent services, it should be simple to spin up new servers, data stores, and other commodity resources - you don’t want every team to come up with their own way of doing it. And once these resources have been provisioned, they have to be configured. To be able to pull this off, you will need a fair amount of automation. Communication Remote calls are expensive and introduce new and fun ways your systems can crumble. You will need defense mechanisms to protect against failures, like timeouts, retries and circuit breakers. You will also have to leverage asynchrony and batching to mitigate the performance hit of communicating across the network. All of which increases the system’s complexity. A lot of what I describe in my book about distributed systems is about dealing with this complexity. That being said, even a monolith doesn’t live in isolation as it’s being accessed by remote clients, and it’s likely to use third-party APIs as well. So eventually, these issues need to be solved there as well, albeit on a smaller scale. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment Continuous integration ensures that code changes are merged into the main branch after an automated build and test processes have run. Once a code change has been merged, it should be automatically published and deployed to a production-like environment, where a battery of integration and end-to-end tests run to ensure that the microservice doesn’t break any service that depends on it. While testing individual microservices is not more challenging than testing a monolith, testing the integration of all the microservices is an order of magnitude harder. Very subtle and unexpected behavior can emerge when individual services interact with each other. Operations Unlike with a monolith, it’s much more expensive to staff each team responsible for a service with its own operations team. As a result, the team that develops a service is typically also on-call for it. This creates friction between development work and operational toll as the team needs to decide what to prioritize during each sprint. Debugging systems failures becomes more challenging as well - you can’t just load the whole application on your local machine and step through it with a debugger. The system has more ways to fail, as there are more moving parts. This is why good logging and monitoring becomes crucial at all levels. Eventual Consistency A side effect of splitting an application into separate services is that the data model no longer resides in a single data store. Atomically updating records stored in different data stores, and guaranteeing strong consistency, is slow, expensive, and hard to get right. Hence, this type of architecture usually requires embracing eventual consistency. Practical Considerations Splitting an application into services adds a lot of complexity to the overall system. Because of that, it’s generally best to start with a monolith and split it up only when there is a good reason to do so. Getting the boundaries right between the services is challenging - it’s much easier to move them around within a monolith until you find a sweet spot. Once the monolith is well matured and growing pains start to rise, then you can start to peel off one microservice at a time from it. You should only start with a microservice first approach if you already have experience with it, and you either have built out a platform for it or have accounted for the time it will take you to build one.

It&#x27;s just a cost that is worth paying to protect the simpler monolith from becoming crap encrusted, disrupted with risky deploys, or constrained by business partners with worse tech stacks. reply eduction 18 hours agoparentWouldn&#x27;t this just be \"having one or two services\"? I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the same as \"microservices\".Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but isn&#x27;t \"microservices\" when you make internal components into services by default, instead of defaulting to making a library or class? reply shados 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a pretty common issue. If you have 2-3 services, it&#x27;s pretty easy to manage. And if you have 1000, you likely have the infra to manage them and get the full benefit.But if you have 20 engineers and 60 services, you&#x27;re likely in a world of pain. That&#x27;s not microservices, it&#x27;s distributed monolith and it&#x27;s the one model that doesn&#x27;t work (but everyone seems to do) reply alrs 4 hours agorootparentA \"microservice\" solves scaling issues for huge companies. If you have 60 microservices, you should probably have 600 engineers (10 per) to deal with them. If you&#x27;re completely underwater and have 10 services per engineer, you&#x27;re 100% absolutely play-acting \"web-scale\" for an audience of really dumb managers&#x2F;investors. reply benterix 33 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s not clear to me what you mean by dealing here. Do you mean developing? If so, I completely agree. If you mean deployments, a small number of engineers can manage hundreds of them easily. reply devjab 3 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on how you do it. We have 5 engineers and around 50 services and it’s much easier for us to maintain that than it was when it was monolith with a couple of services on top.Though to understand why this is, you would have to know just how poorly our monolith was designed. That’s sometimes the issue with monoliths though, they allow you to “cut corners” and suddenly you end up with this huge spiderweb mess of a database that nobody knows who pulls what from because everyone has connected some sort of thing to it and now your monolith isn’t really a monolith because of it. Which isn’t how a monolith is supposed to work, but is somehow always how it ends up working anyway.I do agree though, that the “DevOps” space for “medium-non-software-development” IT departments in larger companies is just terrible. We ended up outsourcing it, sort of, so that our regular IT operations partner (the ones which also help with networking, storage, backups, security and so on) also handle the management part of our managed Kubernetes cluster. So that once something leaves the build pipeline, it’s theirs. Which was surprisingly cheap by the way.I do get where you’re coming from of course. If we had wanted to do it ourselves, we’d likely need to write “infrastructure as code” that was twice the size of the actual services we deploy. reply jabradoodle 1 hour agorootparent> designed. That’s sometimes the issue with monoliths though, they allow you to “cut corners”I find this hard to relate to, the idea you have the discipline and culture to do microservices well if you can&#x27;t do it with a monolith.More likely is you migrate away from the monolith you never invested in fixing, and once you get to microservices you either call it a mistake and migrate back, or you have to eventually finally invest in fixing things.Perhaps your microservice rewrite goes well because you now know your domain after building the monolith, that is another option. reply jabradoodle 1 hour agorootparentprevA distributed monolith isn&#x27;t based on how many services you have, a better question is, how many services do you need to redeploy&#x2F;update to make a change.Yes, by the time you get to thousands of services you hopefully have moved past the distributed monololith, if you built one. reply devoutsalsa 1 hour agorootparentprev>> That&#x27;s not microservices, it&#x27;s distributed monolith and it&#x27;s the one model that doesn&#x27;t work (but everyone seems to do)I called ours a macrolith. reply lr4444lr 17 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t want to get too tied up in the terminology, but \"microservices-first\" does not seem to be the problem the post is describing:One way to mitigate the growing pains of a monolithic backend is to split it into a set of independently deployable services that communicate via APIs. The APIs decouple the services from each other by creating boundaries that are hard to violate, unlike the ones between components running in the same process reply wongarsu 17 hours agorootparentWithout getting tied up in the whole \"every language except assembly, Python and possibly JavaScript already solved this problem by forcing people to adhere to module-level APIs\" argument, I think the crux of the issue is that the article just defines microservice architecture as any architecture consisting of multiple services, and explicitly states \"there doesn’t have to be anything micro about the services\". Which imho is watering down the term microservices too much. You don&#x27;t have microservices as soon as you add a second or third service. reply hinkley 16 hours agorootparentI think we should start calling this Pendulum Blindness.We just go from &#x27;one&#x27; to &#x27;too many&#x27; as equally unworkable solutions to all of our problems, and each side (and each person currently subscribed to that &#x27;side&#x27;) knows the other side is wrong. The assumption is that this means their side is right instead of reality, which is nobody is right.The moderates are right, but their answers are wiggly and they&#x27;re too busy getting stuff done to argue with the purists. But the optics are bad so here we go again on another swing of the swingset.&#x27;Some Services&#x27; is probably right, but it varies with domain, company size, and company structure (Conway&#x27;s Law).

It applies to so many things! reply caller9 6 hours agorootparentprevYou might like \"Software Architecture: The Hard Parts.\" Though you already describe some of the points of the book. There isn&#x27;t a magic bullet and every decision to split something apart or which parts to combine has various trade-offs.The book isn&#x27;t perfect. The use of afferent and efferent terminology and some of the arbitrary methods to put numbers on decisions weren&#x27;t ideal. Most of the concepts are sound. The fact that almost every decision has cost&#x2F;benefit and real world implications for a living product was refreshing. That a monolith can&#x27;t be cut over instantly with zero effort to a perfect system is absolutely true.It&#x27;s good food for thought for anyone considering slicing up a monolith, but maybe don&#x27;t follow it to the letter. reply philwelch 16 hours agorootparentprevThis is why I prefer the old term \"service oriented architecture\" over \"microservices\". \"Microservices\" implies any time a service gets too big, you split it apart and introduce a network dependency even if it introduces more problems than it solves. reply Dudester230602 17 hours agorootparentprevExactly, just use well-factored services of any size and smack anyone saying \"micro...\" with a wet towel for they are just parroting some barely-profitable silicon valley money sinks. reply rmbyrro 17 hours agorootparentprevExactly my thoughts reply sroussey 17 hours agorootparentMicroservices is a newer term than SOA. reply PedroBatista 16 hours agorootparentThey are not the same thing!

Not every language is a good fit for every problem. Being able to write your machine learning deduction services in Python, your server side rendered UI in Rails and your IO and concurrency heavy services in Go might justify the additional overhead of having separate services for these three. reply Cthulhu_ 39 minutes agorootparentYes, but the choice to add a new programming language to your company&#x27;s profile has to be taken with care and due diligence; you should make sure to have a number of developers that know the new language, offer training, incorporate it into your hiring, etc. It&#x27;s an added node to your dependency graph, which can quickly become unmanageable.You should always look into existing languages first. There&#x27;s a lot of \"I rewrote this thing into $language for a 100x performance boost\" posts, in a lot of cases the comments are like \"Yeah but if you rewrote it in the original language you could make it a lot faster too\".For a cool visualisation of this problem, check out https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boringtechnology.club&#x2F; reply renegade-otter 7 hours agorootparentprevThese are almost never pragmatic decisions. Giving teams independence over the stack usually results in resume-driven development, and now your JS developers are forced to maintain a Go server because some jock thought it was a cool thing to do .Due diligence in these cases is rare. reply marcus_holmes 14 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;ve seen this play out for reals at a place a few years ago. Every team used a different tech, and all of them selected because of resume-driven development. People moving teams to get a particular tech on their resume. No common method for deployment, and endless issues getting things deployed. Everyone&#x27;s a newbie because we were all learning a new, cool, stack. And everyone making stupid newbie mistakes.Never again. When I build teams forevermore, I pick the tech stack and I recruit people who know that tech stack, or want to learn that tech stack. And we stick to that tech stack whenever possible. reply Cthulhu_ 38 minutes agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t believe a team should have that much say in their technology, unless they themselves are also responsible for hiring, training, etcetera - so it kinda depends on how autonomous a team is.That said, as the article also mentions, \"micro\" can be a bit of a misnomer; you could have a 50 person team working on a single \"micro\" service, in which case things like hiring and training are much more natural. (to add, I&#x27;ve never worked in a team of 50 on one product; 50 people is A Lot) reply eterevsky 18 hours agoparentprev1) Why is it better than wrapping it in an interface with a clear API without extracting it into a separate service? reply voxic11 18 hours agorootparentBecause of dependency issues like he mentioned. If I am using Library A which depends on version 1 of Library C and I need to start using Library B which depends on version 2 of Library C then I have a clear problem because most popular programming languages don&#x27;t support referencing multiple different versions of the same library. reply slowmovintarget 14 hours agorootparentOSGi and Java Modules would like a word.Too few developers use the facilities available for that kind of in-process isolation, even when it is possible. (Don&#x27;t tell me Java isn&#x27;t popular... It may be the new COBOL, but it&#x27;s still mainstream.) reply lemmsjid 10 hours agorootparentGood show for mentioning that. If it becomes commonplace for popular runtimes and languages to be able to load modules and their dependencies at that level, then a lot of arguments for service encapsulation go away.I think in these discussions, a lot of times people are taking past one another. If I start putting a JRE-targeted application together, I know I can eventually reach for isolated modules if I follow good internal practices, whereas if I&#x27;m in Python land it&#x27;s pretty unattainable. reply smaudet 8 hours agorootparentAWS Lambdas and OSGI invocations are the same thing! (Except one costs you money and one doesn&#x27;t, guess which one is easier to use). reply marwis 2 hours agorootparentprevYour dependencies might be tied to different JVM versions. Less likely but happened few times, especially during 8 to 9+ transition. You would&#x27;ve been stuck with your entire system on Java 8 for ages.Also JNI won&#x27;t be isolated which occasionally might be a factor (more likely for stability).On the other hand one could make colocated multi-process services to work around this while avoiding all the other complexities of microservices. reply smaudet 7 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair the problem is that its not baked into the language.If you have to do X,Y,Z to get A done, then you&#x27;ll do X,Y,Z.If your language gives you a shortcut and now you can get away with X,Y then you&#x27;ll drop Z.And even if your language doesn&#x27;t give you those shortcuts, if Cool Language lets you do just X or X,Y, you&#x27;ll naturally want to use Cool Language. So, its a losing game...KISS is great when applied correctly, but you have to be able to know the level of complexity you&#x27;ll actually need for the problem at hand, and it is so so very easy to over or under engineer something... reply lmm 9 hours agorootparentprev> OSGi and Java Modules would like a word.OSGi is the one that&#x27;s deprecated and Java Modules is the one that can&#x27;t actually provide that functionality yet, right? Or is it the other way round? Either way you get the point. reply foobiekr 16 hours agorootparentprevYou’re not wrong here but usually this comes down to having one or a small number of version specific container processors (and I do not mean container in the docker sense) to host those functions. Not microservices.That said, almost always, if you are seriously trying to keep old unsupported dependencies running, you’re violating any reasonable security stance.I’m not saying it never happens, but often the issues that the code is not understood, and no one is capable of supporting it, and so you are deep in the shit already. reply furstenheim 17 hours agorootparentprevThis node got it just right. You only get this issue for big stateful libraries, like frameworks reply rmbyrro 17 hours agorootparentprevCan&#x27;t we just isolate these two services in containers, using different library versions?They don&#x27;t need to be microservices in order to isolate dependencies, do they?In Python, for instance, you don&#x27;t even need containers. Just different virtual environments running on separate processes. reply jethro_tell 17 hours agorootparentI suppose if you do that, they will communicate over the network likely via api and have the ability to scale independently.You just invented microservices, lol. reply mjr00 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you have two separate processes running in two separate containers... those are two separate services. You need to solve the same problems that would come with running them on two different EC2 instances: what&#x27;s the method for communicating with the other container? What happens if the other container I&#x27;m calling is down? If the other container is down or slow to respond to my API calls, am I dealing with backpressure gracefully or will the system start to experiencing a cascade of failures? reply paulddraper 18 hours agorootparentprevThose dependencies might cross language boundaries, or interfere with your other dependencies running in the same process. reply bingemaker 18 hours agorootparentOn the contrary, when they fail silently, it is hard debug \"dependent\" services reply mark_undoio 16 hours agorootparentIn the Java world, we&#x27;ve developed record&#x2F;replay across microservice boundaries, so it&#x27;s effectively possible to step from a failure in one microservice and into the service that sent it bad data.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.undo.io&#x2F;java&#x2F;Microservices.html[Edit: for which, by the way, any feedback is welcome - it&#x27;s technically quite promising but real world experience is worth a lot!] reply paulddraper 18 hours agoparentprevAnd those would apply toIncreasing architectural complexity to enforce boundaries is never a solution to a lack of organizational discipline,And yet we do this all the time. Your CI&#x2F;CD blocking your PRs until tests pass? That&#x27;s a costly technical solution to solve an issue of organizational discipline. reply nevinera 18 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s technical, and not architectural. I&#x27;m _all about_ technical solutions to lack of discipline, and in fact I think technical and process solutions are the only immediate way to create cultural solutions (which are the long-term ones). I&#x27;d even consider minor increases to architectural complexity for that purpose justifiable - it&#x27;s a real problem, and trading to solve it is reasonable.But architectural complexity has outsized long-term cost, and service-orientation in particular has a _lot_ of it. And in this particular case, it doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem, since you _can&#x27;t_ successfully enforce those domain boundaries unless you already have them well-defined. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentCan you explain the salient distinction between a \"technical\" versus \"architectural\" solution? Candidly, I&#x27;m not convinced that there is one.> But architectural complexity has outsized long-term costAs do technical solutions, of course. CI&#x2F;CD systems are very expensive, just from a monetary perspective, but also impose significant burdens to developers in terms of blocking PRs, especially if there are flaky or expensive tests.> And in this particular case, it doesn&#x27;t actually solve the problem, since you _can&#x27;t_ successfully enforce those domain boundaries unless you already have them well-defined.Ignoring microservices, just focusing on underlying SoA for a moment, the boundary is the process. That is an enforceable boundary. I think what you&#x27;re saying amounts to, in microservice parlance, that there is no way to prevent a single microservice from crossing multiple bounded contexts, that it ultimately relies on developers. This is true, but it&#x27;s also just as true for good monolithic designs around modules - there is no technical constraint for a module to not expand into domains, becoming cluttered and overly complex.Microservices do not make that problem harder, but SoA does give you a powerful technical tool for isolation. reply nevinera 17 hours agorootparent> Can you explain the salient distinction between a \"technical\" versus \"architectural\" solution? Candidly, I&#x27;m not convinced that there is one.Not concisely in the general case, but in this case the difference is fairly straightforward - CI&#x2F;CD doesn&#x27;t affect the structure of your executing application at all, only the surrounding context. I don&#x27;t want to spend the hours it would take to characterize architecture as distinct from implementation, but the vast number of textbooks on the topic all generally agree that there is one, though they draw the lines in slightly different places.> I think what you&#x27;re saying amounts to,Very much no - my point is about the process of implementation. The services.. _do_ enforce boundaries, but the boundaries they enforce may not be good ones.In order to successfully extract services from a monolith, you have to go through a process that includes finding and creating those domain boundaries for the domain being extracted. If it&#x27;s your first time, you might be doing that implicitly and without realizing it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re doing, but under the hood it&#x27;s the bulk of the mental effort.The part where you actually _introduce a service_ can be anywhere from a tenth to half of the work (that fraction varies a lot by technical stack and depending on how coupled the domain in question is to the central behavioral tangle in the monolith), but by the time you&#x27;ve gotten the domain boundary created you&#x27;ve _already solved_ the original problem. Now you&#x27;re facing a trade of \"extract this well-factored domain out to a separate service application, to prevent its now-clear boundaries from being violated in the future\". And I contend that that&#x27;s a trade that should rarely be made. reply danielovichdk 16 hours agorootparentWhich is exactly why the real challenges around (micro) services is to a large extent an organisational challenge mixed how those boundaries are belonging to which business capabilities.The technical part of services is easy enough really but if the organisation leaks its boundaries, which always flow downstream into the actual teams, you are proper fucked.It takes a different level of maturity, both in organisation and team, to build a service oriented software.That&#x27;s my experience at least. reply nevinera 16 hours agorootparentRight! What I&#x27;m fundamentally saying is that the majority of orgs trying to adopt SOA are doing it for the wrong reasons, and will deeply regret it. In general, the \"right way\" to adopt SOA is to extract services one at a time because you have to, to solve various problems you&#x27;ve encountered (scaling problems, technical problems, stability issues), and then realize that you are in fact currently using a service-oriented architecture, and have been for several years. reply jcstauffer 17 hours agorootparentprevI would hope that there is more process in place protecting against downtime than code review - for example automated tests across several levels, burn-in testing, etc.People are not reliable enough to leave them as the only protection against system failure... reply nevinera 17 hours agorootparentDid you mean to reply to somebody else? I&#x27;m a huge believer in automated testing, and if I said something that can be interpreted otherwise I&#x27;d like to clarify it. reply marcosdumay 17 hours agorootparentI guess the GP&#x27;s issue is because automated tests (and every other kind of validation) imposes architectural constraints on your system, and thus are an exception to your rule.I don&#x27;t think that rule can be applied as universally as you stated it. But then, I have never seen anybody breaking it in a bad way that did also break it in a good way, so the people that need to hear it will have no problem with the simplified version until they grow a bit.Anyway, that problem is very general of software development methods. Almost every one of them is contextual. And people start without the maturity to discern the context from the advice, so they tend to overgeneralize what they see. reply nevinera 16 hours agorootparentHm. I think maybe you&#x27;re using \"system\" to mean a different thing than I am? I thinking of \"the system\" as the thing that is executing in production - it provides the business behavior we are trying to provide; there is a larger \"system\" surrounding it, that includes the processes and engineers, and the CI&#x2F;CD pipelines - it too has an \"architecture\", and _that_ architecture gets (moderately) more complex when you add CI&#x2F;CD. Is that where our communication is clashing?Because the complexity of that outer system is also important, but there are a few very major differences between the two that are probably too obvious to belabor. But in general, architectural complexity in the inner system costs a lot more than it does in the outer system, because it&#x27;s both higher churn (development practices change much slower than most products) and higher risk (taking production systems offline is much less permissible than freezing deployments) reply marcosdumay 16 hours agorootparent> I think maybe you&#x27;re using \"system\" to mean a different thing than I am?No, I&#x27;m not. Are you overlooking some of the impacts of your tests and most of the impact of static verification?Those do absolutely impact your system, not only your environment. For tests it&#x27;s good to keep those impacts at a minimum (for static verification you want to maximize them), but they still have some. reply nevinera 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m overlooking any major ones, but we are probably working in quite different types of systems - I&#x27;m not aware of any type of static verification I&#x27;d use in a rails application that would affect _architecture_ in a meaningful way (unless I would write quite terrifying code without the verifier I suppose).I&#x27;m not sure about the tests - it depends on what you&#x27;d consider an impact possibly; I&#x27;ve been trained by my context to design code to be decomposable in a way that _is_ easily testable, but I&#x27;m not sure that is really an &#x27;impact of the tests&#x27; (and I&#x27;m fairly confident that it makes the abstractions less complex instead of more).Would you mind explaining what you mean in more detail? replyjaxr 18 hours agorootparentprevAgreed. isn&#x27;t that why strongly typed languages made a comeback? reply mvdtnz 16 hours agorootparentprevNo, not at all. CI&#x2F;CD blocking pull requests is in place because large systems have large test suites and challenging dependencies which mean that individual developers literally can&#x27;t run every test on their local machine and can often break things without realising it. It&#x27;s not about organisational discipline, it&#x27;s about ensuring correctness. reply bluGill 16 hours agorootparentI can run every test on my machine if I want. It would be a manual effort, but wouldn&#x27;t be hard to automate if I cared to try. However it would take about 5 days to finish. It isn&#x27;t worth it when such tests rarely fail - the CI system just spin them off to many AWS nodes and if something fails then run just that test locally and I get results in a few hours (some of the tests are end to end integration that need more than half an hour).Like any good test system I have a large suite of \"unit\" tests that run quick that I run locally before committing code - it takes a few minutes to get high code coverage if you care about that metric. Even then I just run the tests for x86-64, if they fail on arm that is something for my CI system to figure out for me. reply vrosas 18 hours agorootparentprevThe other problem is that these self-imposed roadblocks are so engrained in the modern SDLC that developers literally cannot imagine a world where they do not exist. I got _reamed_ by some \"senior\" engineers for merging a small PR without an approval recently. And we&#x27;re not some megacorp, we&#x27;re a 12 person engineering startup! We can make our own rules! We don&#x27;t even have any customers... reply jacquesm 18 hours agorootparentYour &#x27;senior&#x27; engineer is likely right: they are trying to get some kind of process going and you are actively sabotaging that. This could come back to haunt you later on when you by your lonesome decide to merge a &#x27;small PR&#x27; with massive downtime as a result of not having your code reviewed. Ok, you say, I&#x27;m perfect. And I believe you. But now you have another problem: the other junior devs on your team who see vrosas commit and merge stuff by themselves will see you as their shining example. And as a result they by their lonesomes decide to merge &#x27;small PR&#x27;s with massive downtime as a result.If you got _reamed_ you got off lucky: in plenty of places you&#x27;d be out on the street.It may well be that you had it right but from context as given I hope this shows you some alternative perspective that might give you pause the next time you decide to throw out the rulebook, even in emergencies - especially in emergencies - these rules are there to keep you, your team and the company safe. In regulated industries you can multiply all of that by a factor of five or so. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparent> Your &#x27;senior&#x27; engineer is likely right: they are trying to get some kind of process going and you are actively sabotaging thatWhy? Because it&#x27;s a \"good practice\"?

You&#x27;d never do that at 50+ engineers with customers but for 12 engineers who have no customers? It&#x27;s fine, in fact it&#x27;s ideal.> with massive downtime as a result.They have no customers, downtime literally does not exist for them. You are following a dogmatic practice that is optimizing for a situation that literally does not exist within their company. reply jacquesm 18 hours agorootparentYou establish a process before you need it, and code review, especially when starting up is a fantastic way to make sure that everybody is on the same page and that you don&#x27;t end up with a bunch of latent issues further down the line. The fact that they have no customers today doesn&#x27;t mean that they won&#x27;t have any in the future and mistakes made today can cause downtime further down the line.If you&#x27;re wondering why software is crap: it is because every new generation of coders insists on making all the same mistakes all over again. Learn from the past, understand that &#x27;good practice&#x27; has been established over many years of very expensive mistakes. 12 engineers is already a nice little recipe for pulling in 12 directions at once and even if they&#x27;re all perfect they can still learn from looking at each others code and it will ensure that there are no critical dependencies on single individuals (which can bite you hard if one of them decides to leave, not unheard of in a startup) and that if need be labor can be re-divided without too much hassle. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not advocating for having no processes, I&#x27;m advocating for a process that matches their situation. A company with no customers should not be worrying about causing a production outage, they should be worried about getting a demoable product out.Dogmatic adherence to a process that limits developer velocity and optimizes for correct code is very likely the wrong call when you have no customers. reply jacquesm 17 hours agorootparentIf it is dogmatic, then yes: but you have no knowledge of that and besides there are always people who believe there is too much process and there are people that there is too little. If you want to challenge the process you do that by talking about it not by breaking the process on purpose. That&#x27;s an excellent way to get fired.I don&#x27;t know the context and I don&#x27;t know the particular business the OP is talking about. What I do know is that if you feel that your management is cargo culting development methodology (which really does happen) you can either engage them constructively or you can leave for a better company. Going in with a confrontational mindset isn&#x27;t going to be a good experience for anybody involved. Case in point: the OP is still upset enough that he feels it necessary to vent about this in an online forum.Note that this is the same person who in another comment wrote:\"On the flip side I’m trying to convince my CTO to fire half our engineering team - a group of jokers he hired during the run-up who are now wildly overpaid and massively under-delivering. With all the tech talent out there I’m convinced we’d replace them all within a week.\" reply vrosas 17 hours agorootparentHeh, both can be true. Process doesn&#x27;t make good engineers any better. Bad code gets approved and merged every day. I&#x27;d rather have a team I could trust to merge and steward their code to production on their own instead of bureaucracy giving people a false sense of security.> Case in point: the OP is still upset enough that he feels it necessary to vent about this in an online forum.I apologize for the conversation starter. reply nevinera 17 hours agorootparentprevWith no customers, one of the purposes of code-review is removed, but it&#x27;s the lesser one anyway. The primary goal of code-review should _not_ be to \"catch mistakes\" in a well-functioning engineering team - that&#x27;s a thing that happens, but mostly your CI handles that. Code-review is about unifying approaches, cross-pollinating strategies and techniques, and helping each other to improve as engineers.Your attitude towards code-review on the other hand is one I&#x27;ve seen before several times, and I was glad when each of those people were fired. reply withinboredom 16 hours agorootparentWe did post-merge code reviews. But half our team was on the other side of the planet from the other half (4 people on the team, US, EU. APAC, and AU).If we waited for reviews before merging, we’d be waiting weeks to merge a single PR. Thus, you wrote your code, opened a PR, did a self-review, then deployed it. We had millions of customers, downtime was a real possibility. So you’d watch metrics and revert if anything looked slightly off.You would wake up to your PR being reviewed. Sometimes there would be mistakes pointed out, suggestions to improve it, etc. Sometimes it was just a thumbs up emoji.The point is, there are many ways to skin this cat and to “ream” someone for merging without deploying is incredibly immature and uncreative. You can still review a merged PR. reply nevinera 16 hours agorootparentThat process sounds fine to me, especially in a context with either good integration coverage or low downtime cost.> to “ream” someone for merging without deploying is incredibly immature and uncreative.I&#x27;d agree, but I _highly_ doubt that description was an accurate one. Read through the other comments by the same person and you&#x27;ll get a picture of their personality pretty quickly.It&#x27;s likely that there was already an ongoing conflict either in general or specifically between them about this issue. They probably got a moderately harsh comment to the effect of \"hey, you&#x27;re expected to wait for code-reviews now, knock it off\" reply vrosas 14 hours agorootparentI suggested it&#x27;s possible to write, commit and own code without others&#x27; approval to increase productivity and people get _extremely_ defensive about it. It&#x27;s so odd. It happened in real life and it&#x27;s happening in this thread now, too. They even attack your character over it. reply withinboredom 12 hours agorootparentYes. Some people get personally attached to code. It’s incredibly frustrating. Some people use reviews to push dogmatic approaches to architecture and&#x2F;or exert some kind of control over things. Whenever I meet these people in a code review, and they make unnecessary suggestions or whatever, my favorite phrase to say is, “I can get behind that, but I don’t think it’s worth the time to do that right now,” or, “I disagree, can you give an argument grounded in computer science.” With the latter only being used twice in my career, when someone left a shitload of comments suggesting variable name changes, and then again, when someone suggested rewriting something that was O(n) to O(n^2) and claimed it was better and wouldn’t give up.You want to get the team to a point where you can disagree and commit, no code will ever be perfect and there is no reason spending 3-4 rounds of change requests trying. I think the worst code review I ever had, ended with me saying, “if you’re going to be this nitpicky, why don’t you take the ticket?” (It was extremely complex and hard to read — and there wasn’t any getting around it, lots of math, bit shifting, and other shenanigans. The reviewer kept making suggestions that would result in bugs, and then make more suggestions…)He came back the next day and approved my PR once he understood the problem I was trying to solve.Even these days, where I work on a close team IRL, I’ve been known to say, “if there are no objections, I’m merging this unreviewed code.” And then I usually get a thumbs up from the team, or they say something like “oh, I wanted to take a look at that. Give me a few mins I got sidetracked!” And I’ve even heard, “I already reviewed it, I just forgot to push approve!”Communication is key in a team. Often, if the team is taking a long time to review, give them the benefit of the doubt, but don’t let yourself get blocked by a review. reply smaudet 7 hours agorootparentIf the code work&#x2F;it&#x27;s tested, review is for sanity checking&#x2F;looking for obvious bugs.Anything else is un-needed grooming that&#x27;s more about the other developer&#x27;s ego, not about good code (sometimes its to follow some other constraint, but its a good sign the person has a personality issue). replynamtab00 14 hours agorootparentprevI cannot agree more, and have nothing to add except \"can I work with you?\".. reply insanitybit 16 hours agorootparentprevYou have no idea what my attitude towards code-review is. reply nevinera 16 hours agorootparentWell, partly that was a mistaken impression because I thought that your comment was also from vrosas. But I think there&#x27;s enough in there to assess your attitude toward code-review at least a _bit_:> They have 12 people and no customers, they can almost certainly adopt a very aggressive developer cycle that optimizes almost exclusively for happy-path velocity. You&#x27;d never do that at 50+ engineers with customers but for 12 engineers who have no customers? It&#x27;s fine, in fact it&#x27;s ideal.12 engineers churning out code with no code-review at all? That&#x27;ll produce velocity, for sure. It&#x27;ll also produce not just an unmaintainable mess, but an interesting experiment, in which you get to find out which of your engineers are socially capable enough to initiate technical communication independently and construct technical rapport _without_ that process helping them to do so. Hope none of them hold strong technical opinions that clash! reply insanitybit 15 hours agorootparentWho said \"no code-review at all\"? Not me, not vrosas as far as I saw. reply OJFord 10 hours agorootparentprevNo, because you&#x27;re not infallible, you&#x27;ll merge some crap, some things that are outright wrong, that your reviewer might have caught and that slight delay is less painful than dealing with that commited mistake - whether it be an incident in production or &#x27;just&#x27; confusion when the next person in that area has to work out if your bug was for some reason intentional and what might break if they fix it. reply vrosas 18 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m challenging my team to actually think about that process, why it&#x27;s in place, how it&#x27;s helping (or actively hurting!) us. Comparing ourselves to companies that have regulatory requirements (spoiler: we don&#x27;t and likely won&#x27;t for a long, long time) just furthers my point that no one really thinks about these things. They just cargo cult how everyone else does it. reply jacquesm 18 hours agorootparentYou can challenge them without actually violating established process. I wasn&#x27;t comparing you to companies that have regulatory requirements, I was merely saying that all of the above will factor in much, much stronger still in a regulated industry.But not being in a regulated industry doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a very good reason to have a code review in your process, assuming it is used effectively and not for nitpicking.Not having a code review step is usually a bad idea, unless everybody on your team is of absolutely amazing quality and they never make silly mistakes. I&#x27;ve yet to come across a team like that, but maybe you are the exception to the rule. reply mgkimsal 17 hours agorootparentprevThen... the people responsible for this should have blocked PRs without a review. Or protected the target branch. Or... something. If it&#x27;s sacrosanct to do what OP did, but the &#x27;senior&#x27; folks didn&#x27;t put in actual guardrails to prevent it... OP is not entirely at fault. reply elzbardico 17 hours agorootparentprevReally man. I have almost two decades developing software and yet, I feel a lot more comfortable having all my code reviewed. If anything I get annoyed by junior developers in my team when they just rub-stamp my PRs because supposedly I am this super senior guy that can&#x27;t err. Code Reviews are supposed to give you peace of mind, not being a hassle.During all this time, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of \"small changes\" having completely unexpected consequences, and sometimes all it would take to avoid would someone else seeing it from another perspective. reply foobiekr 16 hours agorootparentAt 30 years of coding professionally in great engineering-focused organizations, and that on top of nearly a lifetime of having coded for myself, I’ve concluded code reviews barely work.I agree with everything you say here, but honestly it’s quite ineffective. I wish we had found something better than unit tests (often misleading and fragile) and the ability of a qualified reviewer to maintain attention and context that a real review entails. reply vvanders 6 hours agorootparentIMO catching bugs is a nice side-effect of code reviews.The primary value I&#x27;ve seen across teams has been more on having shared team context across a codebase, if something goes bump in the night you&#x27;ve got a sense on how that part of the codebase works. It&#x27;s also a great opportunity for other engineers to ask \"why\" and explain parts that aren&#x27;t obvious or other context that&#x27;s relevant. We&#x27;ll find the occasional architectural mismatch(although we like to catch those much earlier in the design process) and certainly prevented bugs from shipping but if that&#x27;s the primary focus I think a team is missing a lot of the value from regular code reviews. reply vrosas 17 hours agorootparentprevNot a man.I’m not convinced bad code would get merged more often if we didn’t require approvals. I am convinced we’d deliver code faster though, and that’s what I’m trying to optimize for. Your company and engineering problems are not the same as mine. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, dogmatic adherence to arbitrary patterns is a huge problem in our field. People have strong beliefs, \"X good\" or \"X bad\", with almost no idea of what X even is, what the alternatives are, why X was something people did or did not like, etc. reply jacquesm 18 hours agorootparentAnother problem is people making decisions with potentially far reaching consequences well above their paygrade without authorization. reply insanitybit 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that problem is nearly as significant. reply jacquesm 17 hours agorootparentWhat you think is usually the limit of your experience, which effectively makes it anecdata. I&#x27;ve looked at enough companies and dealt with the aftermath of enough such instances that I beg to differ. It&#x27;s possible that due to the nature of my business my experience is skewed in the other direction which makes that anecdata as well.

I think everyone recognizes that it makes sense that domain name resolution is performed by an external service, and very few people are out there integrating a recursive DNS resolver and cache into their monolith. And yet, this long-standing division of responsibility never seems to count as an example. reply nevinera 18 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re certainly misunderstanding me. Microservices are definitely justifiable in plenty of cases, and _services_ even more often. But they _need to be technically justified_ - that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m making.The majority of SOA adoption in small-to-medium tech companies is driven by the wrong type of pain, by technical leaders that can see that if they had their domains already split out into services, their problems would not exist, but don&#x27;t understand that reaching that point involves _solving their problems first_. reply foobiekr 16 hours agorootparentWhenever someone on the projects, I’m attached to tries to create a new service, first I asked them what data it works with, and then I ask them what the alternative to making this a service would be. Usually, by the time we start answering the second question, they realize that, actually, adding the service is just more work.To me, what’s amazing is that in almost no organization is there a requirement to justify technically the addition of a new service, despite the cost and administrative and cognitive overhead of doing so. reply Scarblac 18 hours agorootparentprev_Services_ are obviously a good idea (nobody is arguing something like PostgreSQL or Redis or DNS or what have you should all run in the same process as the web server)._Microservices_ attract the criticism. It seems to assume something about the optimal size of services (\"micro\") that probably isn&#x27;t optimal for all kinds of service you can think of. reply mjr00 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s funny because the term \"microservices\" picked up in popularity because previously, most \"service-oriented architecture\" (the old term) implementations in large companies had services that were worked on by dozens or hundreds of developers, at least in my experience. So going from that to services that were worked on by a single development team of ~10 people was indeed a \"microservice\" relatively speaking.Now, thanks to massive changes in how software is built (cloud, containers et al) it&#x27;s a lot more standard for a normal \"service\" with no prefix to be built by a small team of developers, no micro- prefix needed. reply Scarblac 18 hours agorootparentI can understand wanting to split things off so that one team handles one service, roughly.There was a recent thread here where someone mentioned he personally was responsible for about four of their microservices... reply nicoburns 18 hours agorootparentYeah, my last company had 10 microservices (the entirety of their codebase) managed by a single team when I started. Some of them had fewer than 5 API endpoints (and weren&#x27;t doing anything complex to justify that). reply xnorswap 18 hours agorootparentprevThat may be true, but the article describes a services architecture and labels it microservices, indeed goes onto to say:> The term micro can be misleading, though - there doesn’t have to be anything micro about the services reply Scarblac 18 hours agorootparentYes, but the \"widespread meme\" as I see it is about microservices, not services in general. reply butlerm 18 hours agorootparentThe smaller the service, the more likely that the overhead of having a separate service exceeds the benefit of doing so. It isn&#x27;t at all normal for a service to have its own database unless it provides a substantial piece of functionality, for example, and there are non-trivial costs to splitting databases unnecessarily. If you are not very careful, it is a good way to make certain things a dozen times slower and a dozen times more expensive to develop. reply arethuza 17 hours agorootparentprevYou do see people arguing for running SQLite in-process rather than using a separate database server like PostgreSQL? reply jeffbee 18 hours agorootparentprevThis seems subjective. It&#x27;s like putting \"compatible with the character of the neighborhood\" in a city&#x27;s zoning codes. reply mjr00 18 hours agorootparentprev> I find it odd that there is this widespread meme—on HN, not in the industry—that microservices are never justified.There&#x27;s a few things in play IMO.One is lack of definition -- what&#x27;s a \"microservice\" anyhow? Netflix popularized the idea of microservices literally being a few hundred lines of code maintained by a single developer, and some people believe that&#x27;s what a microservice is. Others are more lax and see microservices as being maintained by small (4-10 person) development teams.Another is that most people have not worked at a place where microservices were done well, because they were implemented by CTOs and \"software architects\" with no experience at companies with 10 developers. There are a lot of problems that come from doing microservices poorly, particularly around building distributed monoliths and operational overhead. It&#x27;s definitely preferable to have a poorly-built monolith than poorly-built microservice architectures.I&#x27;ve been at 4 companies that did microservices (in my definition, which is essentially one service per dev team). Three were a great development experience and dev&#x2F;deploy velocity was excellent. One was a total clusterfuck. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t lack a definition, there&#x27;s lots of people talking about this. In general you&#x27;ll find something like \"a small service that solves one problem within a single bounded context\".> It&#x27;s definitely preferable to have a poorly-built monolith than poorly-built microservice architectures.I don&#x27;t know about \"definitely\" at all. Having worked with some horrible monoliths, I really don&#x27;t think I agree. Microservices can be done poorly but at minimum there&#x27;s a fundamental isolation of components. If you don&#x27;t have any isolation of components it was never even close to microservices&#x2F;SoA, at which point, is it really a fair criticism? reply mjr00 18 hours agorootparent> It doesn&#x27;t lack a definition, there&#x27;s lots of people talking about this. In general you&#x27;ll find something like \"a small service that solves one problem within a single bounded context\".How small is small? Even within this comment section there are people talking about a single developer being the sole maintainer of multiple microservices. I&#x27;m a strong advocate of (micro?)service architecture but I would never recommend doing the \"all behavior is 100-line lambda functions\" approach.A horrible monolith vs horrible microservices is subjective, of course, but IMO having everything self-contained to one repository, one collection of app servers, etc. at least gives you some hope of salvation, often by building new functionality in separate services, ironically. Horrible microservices that violate data boundaries, i.e. multiple services sharing a database which is a sadly common mistake, is a much harder problem to solve. (both are bad, of course!) reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparent\"Small\" is a relative term, and not an ideal one, but what it generally means is \"no larger than is needed\" - that is, if you have one concrete solution within a bounded context, \"small\" is the code necessary to implement that solution.

It&#x27;s even more important in a microservice world to ensure that you can update dependencies across your organization atomically.> Horrible microservices that violate data boundaries, i.e. multiple services sharing a database which is a sadly common mistake, is a much harder problem to solve.But that&#x27;s not microservices. Maybe this is in and of itself an issue of microservice architecture, the fact that people think they&#x27;re implementing microservices when they&#x27;re actually just doing SoA, but microservice architecture would absolutely not include multiple services with a single database, that would not be microservices.So I think the criticism would be \"people find it hard to actually implement microservices\" and not \"microservice architecture leads to these problems\", because microservice architecture is going to steer you away from multiple services using one database. reply sally_glance 17 hours agorootparentA little off topic but there are even more sinister patterns than the shared database which some architects are actively advocating for, like1. The \"data service\" layer, which (if done improperly) is basically just a worse SQL implemented on top of HTTP but still centralised. Though now you can claim it&#x27;s a shared service instead of a DB.2. The \"fat cache\" database - especially common in strongly event-based systems. Basically every service decides to store whatever it needs from events to have lower latency access for common data. Sounds great but in practice leads to (undocumented) duplicate data, which theoretically should be synchronised but since those service-local mirror DBs are usually introduced without central coordination it&#x27;s bound to desync at some point. replypjc50 18 hours agorootparentprevDNS resolution is genuninely reusable, though.

Because the only thing that stops a new cowboy engineer is their peers explaining to them in what ways this isn&#x27;t the Wild Wesst. One can assume if rules would benefit the team, they&#x27;d be doing them already, so why don&#x27;t they? Maybe they perceive feature output velocity to be too high to risk changing method. Maybe decisionmaking power rests in the hands of one system architect who is holding the whole machine in their head so things that look complex to others seem simple to them (in that case, the team needs to spread around peer review signoff responsibilities on purpose, so one engineer can&#x27;t be the decisionmaker and the architecture itself must self-describe). Maybe (this is how I see it usually happen) they were a three-person startup and complexity crept up on them like a boiling frog. Whatever the reason, if you&#x27;re gonna convince them otherwise, someone&#x27;s gonna have to generate hard data on how changing the abstraction could make their jobs easier.2) If management has no idea what \"prioritize quality\" means (meaning no metrics by which to measure it and no real grasp of the art of software engineering), the engineers will interpret buzzwords as noise and route around them. Management needs to give actionable goals other than \"release feature X by Y date\" if they want to change engineering culture. That can take many forms (I&#x27;ve seen rewarded fixit weeks and externally-reported issue burndown charts as two good examples).3) Engineering leadership needs time and bandwidth to do training so they can see outside their prairie-dog hole over to how other teams solve problems. Otherwise, they get locked into the solutions they know, and the only way new approaches ever enter the team is by hires.And the key thing is: microservices may not be the tool for the job when all is said and done. This is an approach to give your engineering team ways to discover the right patterns, not to trick them into doing microservices. Your engineering team, at the end of the day, is still the best-equipped people to know the machinery of the product and how to shape it. reply com2kid 9 hours agorootparentprevOr how about \"we want to update a 3rd party library due to a critical security issue, but we can&#x27;t because that library is used in 500 different parts of the code and no way in hell can we stop development across the entire org for multiple weeks\".With microservices, you deploy the updates to public facing services first, write any learnings down, pass it along to the next most vulnerable tier.Heck on multiple occasions I&#x27;ve been part of projects where just updating the build system for a monolithic codebase was a year+ long effort involving dozens of engineers trying to work around commits from everyone else.Compare this to a microservice model where you just declare all new services get the new build tools. If the new tools come with a large enough carrot (e.g. new version of typescript) teams may very well update their own build tooling to the latest stuff without anyone even asking them to! reply nijave 11 hours agorootparentprevMicroservices don&#x27;t magically fix shared schema headaches. Getting abstraction and APIs right is the solution regardless of whether it&#x27;s in-memory or over the network.Instead of microservices, you could add a static analysis build step that checks if code in packages is calling private or protected interfaces in different packages. That would also help enforce service boundaries without introducing the network as the boundary. reply sally_glance 16 hours agorootparentprevThis applies to performance optimizations which leave the interface untouched, but there are other scenarios, for example:- Performance optimizations which can&#x27;t be realized without changing the interface model. For example, FOO_TABLE should actually be BAR and BAZ with different update patterns to allow for efficient caching and querying.- Domain model updates, adding&#x2F;updating&#x2F;removing new properties or entities.This kind of update will still require the 32 consumers to upgrade.

Either you have to making some breaking changes or your product is calcified at that point.If this is a real concern then you should be asking what you can do to keep from getting into that state, and the answer is encapsulating services in defined interfaces&#x2F;boundaries that are small enough that the team understands everything going on in the critical database layer. reply pjc50 18 hours agorootparentprevThis was why the \"if you breach the service boundary you&#x27;re fired\" Amazon memo was issued. reply sethammons 18 hours agorootparentprevanother reason why you provide data only over API - don&#x27;t reach into my tables and lock me into an implementation. reply simonw 18 hours agorootparentAn approach I like better than \"only access my data via API\" is this:The team that maintains the service is also responsible for how that service is represented in the data warehouse.The data warehouse tables - effectively denormalized copies of the data that the service stores - are treated as another API contract - they are clearly documented and tested as such.If the team refactors, they also update the scripts that populate the data warehouse.If that results in specific columns etc becoming invalid they document that in their release notes, and ideally notify other affected teams. reply hermanradtke 17 hours agorootparentThis same thing can be applied to contracts when firing events, etc. I point people to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineering.linkedin.com&#x2F;distributed-systems&#x2F;log-wha... and use the same approach to ownership. reply simonw 17 hours agorootparentYeah, having a documented stream of published events in Kafka is a similar API contract the team can be responsible for - it might even double as the channel through which the data warehouse is populated. replycrabbone 15 hours agorootparentprevFound the author of CISCO &#x2F; Java Spring documentation.I honestly expected people used passive-aggressive corpo-slang only for work &#x2F; ironically. But this reads intentionally obfuscated.But, to answer to the substance: you for some reason assumed that whoever designed first solution was an idiot and whoever designed the second was, at least clairvoyant.The problem you describe isn&#x27;t a result of inevitable design decisions. You just described a situation where someone screwed up doing something and didn&#x27;t screw up doing something else. And that led you to believe that whatever that something else is, it&#x27;s easier to design.The reality of the situation is, unfortunately, the reverse. Upgrading microservices is much harder than replacing components in monolithic systems because it&#x27;s easier to discover all users of the feature. There are, in general, fewer components in monolithic systems, so less things will need to change. Deployment of a monolithic system will be much more likely to discover problems created by incorrectly implemented upgrade.In my experience of dealing with both worlds, microservices tend to create a maze-like system where nobody can be sure if any change will not adversely affect some other part of the system due to the distributed and highly fragmented nature of such systems. So, your ideas about upgrades are uncorroborated by practice. If you want to be able to update with more ease, you should choose a smaller, more cohesive system. reply perrylaj 12 hours agorootparentI think I view the situation in a similar fashion as you. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing preventing a well architected modular monolith from establishing domain&#x2F;module-specific persistence that is accessible only through APIs and connectable only through the owning domain&#x2F;module. To accomplish that requires a decent application designer&#x2F;architect, and yes, it needs to be considered ahead of time, but it&#x27;s 100% doable and scalable across teams if needed.There are definitely reasons why a microservice architecture could make sense for an organization, but \"we don&#x27;t have good application engineers&#x2F;architects\" should not be one of them. Going to a distributed microservice model because your teams aren&#x27;t good enough to manage a modular monolith sounds like a recipe for disaster. reply shadowgovt 18 hours agorootparentprevAs with so many software solutions, the success of microservices is predicated upon having sufficient prognostication about how the system will be used to recognize where the cut-points are.When I hear success stories like that, I have to ask \"Is there some inherent benefit to the abstraction or did you get lucky in picking your cleave-points?\" reply esafak 17 hours agorootparentThat comes with experience, but you can let time be the judge if you factor your monolith early enough.

It means that you have an impassable boundary, one that is actually physically enforced - your two services have to treat each other as if they are isolated.Isolation is not anything to scoff at, it&#x27;s one of the most powerful features you can encode into your software. Isolation can improve performance, it can create fault boundaries, it can provide security boundaries, etc.This is the same foundational concept behind the actor model - instead of two components being able to share and mutate one another&#x27;s memory, you have two isolated systems (actors, microservices) that can only communicate over a defined protocol. reply nicoburns 18 hours agorootparent> Network calls are a powerful thing to introduce. It means that you have an impassable boundary, one that is actually physically enforced - your two services have to treat each other as if they are isolated.That is not too true at all. I&#x27;ve seen \"microservice\" setups where one microservice depends on the state within another microservice. And even cases where service A calls into service B which calls back into service A, relying on the state from the initial call being present.Isolation is good, but microservices are neither necessary nor sufficient to enforce it. reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentWell, I&#x27;d say you&#x27;ve seen SoA setups that do that, maybe. But those don&#x27;t sound like microservices :) Perhaps that&#x27;s not a strong point though.Let me be a bit clearer on my point because I was wrong to say that you have to treat a service as being totally isolated, what I should have said that they are isolated, whether you treat them that way or not. There is a physical boundary between two computers. You can try to ignore that boundary, you can implement distributed transactions, etc, but the boundary is there - if you do the extra work to try to pretend it isn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s a lot of extra work to do the wrong thing.Concretely, you can write: rpc_call(&mut my_state)But under the hood what has to happen, physically, is that your state has to be copied to the other service, the service can return a new state (or an update), and the caller can then mutate the state locally. There is no way for you to actually transfer a mutable reference to your own memory to another computer (and a service should be treated as if it may be on another computer, even if it is colocated) without obscene shenanigans. You can try to abstract around that isolation to give the appearance of shared mutable state but it is just an abstraction, it is effectively impossible to implement that directly.But shared mutable state is trivial without the process boundary. It&#x27;s just... every function call. Any module can take a mutable pointer and modify it. And that&#x27;s great for lots of things, of course, you give up isolation sometimes when you need to. reply nicoburns 18 hours agorootparentHmm... I guess I very rarely use shared mutable state in web services anyway. The last job I worked at, all state was either in the database (effectively another service anyway) or stored on the client (e.g. auth tokens). So anything that was mutating a function parameter would already be subject to extra scrutiny during code review (Why is it doing that? What scope &#x2F; module boundary is the mutation limited to?). reply insanitybit 18 hours agorootparentShared mutable state also goes beyond a mutable reference. If you call a function and that function throws an exception you are tying the caller&#x2F;callee&#x27;s states together. In a SoA the callee machine can literally blow up and your caller state is preserved.If your web service is generally low-state and these problems are manageable for the complexity scale you&#x27;re solving for, microservices aren&#x27;t really something to even consider - I mean, you basically have a microservice already, it&#x27;s solving a single problem within a bounded context, give or take. It&#x27;s just... one service and one context. reply manicennui 17 hours agorootparentprevIt is trivial to tightly couple two services. They don&#x27;t have to treat each other as isolated at all. The same people who create tightly coupled code within a single service are likely going to create tightly coupled services. reply insanitybit 17 hours agorootparentI think I&#x27;ve covered this in another comment just below the one you&#x27;ve replied to. reply crabbone 15 hours agorootparentprevThe reality of this situation is that the tool everyone is using to build microservices is Kubernetes. It imposes a huge tax on communication between services. So your aspiration as to improving performance fly out of the window.On top of this, you need to consider that most of the software you are going to write will be based on existing components. Many of these have no desire to communicate over network, and your micro- or w&#x2F;e size services will have to cave in to their demands. Simple example: want to use Docker? -- say hello to UNIX sockets. Other components may require communication through shared memory, filesystem, and so on.Finally, isolation is not a feature of microservices, especially if the emphasis is on micro. You have to be able to control the size and where you want to draw the boundary. If you committed upfront to having your units be as small as possible -- well, you might have function-level isolation, but you won&#x27;t have class- or module- or program-level isolation, to put it in more understandable terms. This is where your comparison between the actors model and microservices breaks: first doesn&#x27;t prescribe the size. reply insanitybit 15 hours agorootparentMicroservices definitely predate k8s, but sure, lots of people use k8s. I don&#x27;t know what penalty you&#x27;re referring to. There is a minor impact on network performance for containers measured in microseconds under some configurations. Maybe Kubernetes makes that worse somehow? I think it does some proxying stuff so you probably pay for a local hop to something like Envoy. If Envoy is on your system and you&#x27;re not double-wrapping your TLS the communication with it should stay entirely in the kernel, afaik.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;domino.research.ibm.com&#x2F;library&#x2F;cyberdig.nsf&#x2F;papers&#x2F;0...In no way is this throwing out performance.

At least that’s my take on it. reply tcgv 11 hours agorootparentprev> Most places I&#x27;ve worked with microservices had 2 or 3 approved languages for this reason (and others) and exceptions could be made by leadership if a team could show they had no other options.This works well if you have knowledge redundancy in your organization, i.e., multiple teams that are experienced in each programming language. This way, if one or more developers experienced in language &#x27;A&#x27; quit, you can easily replace them by rearranging developers from other teams.In small companies, this flexibility of allowing multiple languages can result in a situation in which developers moving to other jobs or companies will leave a significant gap that can only be filled with recruiting (then onboarding), which takes much more time and will significantly impact the product development plan.More often than not, the choice between Microservices and Monoliths is more of a business decision than a technical one to make. reply LelouBil 9 hours agorootparent> More often than not, the choice between Microservices and Monoliths is more of a business decision than a technical one to make.I think that, technically you can use one or the other and make it work. However management is very different in the two cases, so I completely agree with you. I hadn&#x27;t thought of the part about moving people between teams.It&#x27;s my first job but I understand why they chose microservices : 6 teams working on 6 \"features&#x2F;apps\" can be managed (almost) fully independently of each other if you split your code base. reply nijave 11 hours agorootparentprevI think it&#x27;s fair to say microservices increase the need for governance, whether manual or automated systems. When you start having more than 1 thing, you create the \"how do I keep things consistent and what level of consistency do I want\" problem reply LelouBil 9 hours agorootparentprevIn the department I work there&#x27;s a lot of microservices, about 5-6 so 5-6 teams. But everything is quarkus&#x2F;spring java and nothing else. reply cpill 15 hours agoparentprev> God forbid you find yourself with a need to rewrite one of these shitpiles. Actually, this is much easier with micro services as you have a clear interface you need to support and the code is not woven into the rest of the monolith like a French plat. The best code is the easiest to throw away and rewrite, because let&#x27;s face it, the older the code is, the more hands it&#x27;s been through, the worse it is, but more importantly the less motivated anyone is in maintaining it. reply lemmsjid 14 hours agorootparentIf the monolithic application is written in a language with sufficient encapsulation and good tooling around multi-module projects, then you can indeed have well known and encapsulated interfaces within the monolith. Within the monolith itself you can create a DAG of enforced interfaces and dependencies that is logically identical to a set of services from different codebases. There are well known design issues in monoliths that can undermine this approach (the biggest one that comes to mind is favoring composition over inheritance, because that&#x27;s how encapsulation can be most easily broken as messages flow across a single-application interfaces, but then I&#x27;d also throw in enforced immutability, and separating data from logic).It takes effort to keep a monolithic application set up this way, but IMHO the effort is far less than moving to and maintaining microservices. I think a problem is that there&#x27;s very popular ecosystems that don&#x27;t have particularly good tooling around this approach, Python being a major example--it can be done, but it&#x27;s not smooth.To me the time when you pull the trigger on a different service+codebase should not be code complexity, because that can be best managed in one repo. It is when you need a different platform in your ecosystem (say your API is in Java and you need Python services so they can use X Y or Z packages as dependencies), or when you have enough people involved that multiple teams benefit from owning their own soup-to-nuts code-to-deployment ecosystem, or when, to your point, you have a chunk of code that the team doesn&#x27;t or can&#x27;t own&#x2F;maintain and wants to slowly branch functionality away from. reply protomolecule 13 hours agorootparent\"composition over inheritance, because that&#x27;s how encapsulation can be most easily broken as messages flow across a single-application interfaces, but then I&#x27;d also throw in enforced immutability, and separating data from logic\"Could you elaborate on this? I see how \"separating data from logic\" is a problem but what about the other two? reply lemmsjid 10 hours agorootparentWell now that you mention it I think it does all come down to &#x27;separating data from logic&#x27;. I was working backwards from the premise of: \"what if we want a monolithic in-process application to have the same cognitive simplicity as an API-based client-server model?\"If you want to enforce a clean interface between an in-process client and server (i.e. a piece of code calling a library interface), then the best model is to think of it as a message passing system, where once a payload is passed from the client to the server and vice versa, the other side should not be able to witness changes to the payload. An immutable payload in this context is the same as the json that goes over the wire between a client and server.If you really wanted an in-process application to look like a microservice you could take the added step of forcing a serialization &#x2F; deserialization step on both client and server. I&#x27;ve seen frameworks that do this. But I think immutability, if it can be enforced, is a practical way of solving this problem and far less complex.Inheritance is a hazier point I was making, in hindsight, because you could use inheritance for data modeling, which is quite fine in some situations... so I think it&#x27;s effectively subsumed under the \"separating data from logic\" argument: which is that if you&#x27;re passing behavioral inheritance from a \"server\" to a \"client\", then it gets harder and harder to predict how that client is going to use it and thus it&#x27;s harder to reason about",

Andrew Ng, a professor at Stanford University who taught machine learning to the likes of OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, and who himself co-founded Google Brain and was chief scientist at Baidu’s Artificial Intelligence Group, said that the “bad idea that AI could make us go extinct” was merging with the “bad idea that a good way to make AI safer is to impose burdensome licensing requirements” on the AI industry.

Without the West to innovate, they won&#x27;t take charge of anything.A price paid, I think, due a conformant, restrictive culture. And after all, even if you do excel, you may soon disappear. reply mlmandude 13 hours agorootparentThis is what was said about Japan prior to their electronics industry surpassing the rest of the world. Yes, china does copy. However, in many instances those companies move faster and innovate faster than their western counterparts. Look at the lidar industry in china. It&#x27;s making mass market lidar in the tens of thousands [see hesai]. There is no american or european equivalent at the moment. What about DJI? They massively out innovated western competitors. I wouldn&#x27;t be so quick to write off that country&#x27;s capacity for creativity and technological prowess. reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentThis may surprise, but Japan is not China. Their culture is not the same. Further their culture was shifted to capitalism at the end of WWII. Citing Japan, is supporting my point about culture.Mass marketing things isn&#x27;t innovation. It&#x27;s copying. DJI seems like more copying. \"Innovation\" isn&#x27;t marketing. It&#x27;s raw research and development, along market paths which are useful. This requires a desire for change, a desire to not conform first, but capitalism first, and this is what China&#x27;s culture does not have. reply sgu999 1 hour agorootparentChina isn&#x27;t a communist country, it&#x27;s first and foremost authoritarian. They do have ruthless capitalism, and the ruthless competition in between individuals that comes with it.They inherit from confucianism, and a more collectivist mindset that is prevalent in this area of the planet, but I don&#x27;t think it should be conflated with the way the economy is organised.The Japanese on the other hand are overall conformist and conservative.With just these counter examples, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re looking at the right variables to judge whether innovation is embedded in the culture or not. reply ska 11 hours agorootparentprev> China doesn&#x27;t innovate, it copies, clones, and steals.FWIW There was a time when that was was the received wisdom about the USA, from the point of view of European powers. It was shortsighted, and not particularly accurate then either. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentAnd in more recent times, how the USA first viewed Japan and later Korea. reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentAnd yet Japan and Korea both were shifted to more Western modes of thought, about innovation, development, and an adoption of democracy and personal rights. This supports my point. reply sgu999 1 hour agorootparentWhere do you get that from?All the people I know who worked with and for Korean and Japanese entities have countless examples to show how alien the corporate culture is for westerners.South Korea in particular doesn&#x27;t seem exactly like a heaven for personal growth and experimentation. reply heavyset_go 1 hour agorootparentprevIndustrial espionage happens everywhere, the US does it, as well. At some point this excuse starts becoming cope. reply dangus 13 hours agorootparentprevI think it’s a mistake to believe that all China can do is copy and clone.It’s also a mistake to underestimate the market value of copies and clones. In many cases a cloned version of a product is better than the original. E.g., clones that remove over-engineering of the original and simplify the product down to its basic idea and offer it at a lower price.It’s also a mistake to confuse manufacturing prowess for the ability to make “copies.” It’s not China’s fault that its competitors quite literally won’t bother producing in their own country.It’s also a mistake to confuse a gain of experience for stealing intellectual property. A good deal of innovation in Silicon Valley comes from the fact that developers can move to new companies without non-compete clauses and take what they learned from their last job to build new, sophisticated software.The fact that a bunch of Western companies set up factories in China and simultaneously expect Chinese employees and managers to gain zero experience and skill in that industry is incredibly contradictory. If we build a satellite office for Google and Apple in Austin, Texas then we shouldn’t be surprised that Austin, Texas becomes a hub for software startups, some of which compete with the companies that chose Austin in the first place. reply TerrifiedMouse 13 hours agorootparentFrankly I think the only reason China copies and clones is because it’s the path of least resistance to profit. They have lax laws on IP protection. Ther is no reason to do R&D when you can just copy&#x2F;clone and make just as much money with none of the risk.And that’s probably the only reason. If push comes to shove, they can probably innovate if given proper incentives.I heard the tale about the Japanese lens industry. For the longest time they made crap lens that were just clones of foreign designs until the Japanese government banned licensing of foreign lens designs forcing their people to design their own lens. Now they are doing pretty well in that industry if I’m right. reply dangus 11 hours agorootparentYou need to have an understanding of Chinese culture and the ability to interface with local Chinese officials to get your counterfeiting complaint handled.You also have to be making something that isn’t of critical strategic importance.Example: glue https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;transcripts&#x2F;702642262 reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentprevIt’s also a mistake to confuse a gain of experience for stealing intellectual property. A good deal of innovation in Silicon Valley comes from the fact that developers can move to new companies without non-compete clauses and take what they learned from their last job to build new, sophisticated software.The amount of outright theft of entire IP from US, Canadian, and European countries by China is well known. There is no confusion here, in more recent times people have been arrested and charged for it, and it&#x27;s how China is able to compete. reply sangnoir 11 hours agorootparentprev> China doesn&#x27;t innovate, it copies, clones, and stealsExplain DJI and Douyin&#x2F;TikTok. reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentTikTok is Chinese owned.

If an adversarial entity has greater economic efficiency, they can outcompete you -- the way the US won the Cold War was essentially by having a stronger economy. If an adversarial entity has a greater ability to manipulate people, that could be even worse.> If you want to live in China, go live in China. I assure you you will not find it to be the law less free hold of “anything goes” that you somehow imagine.But that&#x27;s precisely the issue -- it&#x27;s not an anarchy, it&#x27;s an authoritarian competing nation state. We have to be better than them so the country that has an elected government and constitutional protections for human rights is the one with an economic advantage, because it isn&#x27;t a law of nature that those things always go together, but it&#x27;s a world-eating disaster if they don&#x27;t. reply wokwokwok 12 hours agorootparent> Or they do exist for a reason but the rules are still absurd and net harmfulOk.…but if you have a law and you’re opposed to it on the basis that “China will do it anyway”, you admit that’s stupid?Shouldn’t you be asking: does the law do a useful thing? Does it make the world better? Is it compatible with our moral values?Organ harvesting.Stem cell research.Human cloning.AI.Slavery.How can anyone stand there and go “well China will do it so we may as well?”In an abstract sense this is a fundamentally invalid logical argument.Truth on the basis of arbitrary assertion.It. Is. False.Now, certainly there is a degree of naunce with regard to AI specifically; but the assertion that we will be “left behind” and “out competed by China” are not relevant to the discussion on laws regarding AI and AI development.What we do is not governed by what China may or may not do.If you want to win the “AI race” to AGI, then investment and effort is required, not allowing an arbitrary “anything goes” policy.China as a nation is sponsoring the development of its technology and supporting its industry.If you want want to beat that, opposing responsible AI won’t do it. reply tensor 9 hours agorootparentOf course you have to consider what other countries will do when you create your laws. The notion that you can ignore the rest of the world is both naive and incredibly arrogant.There are plenty of technologies that absolutely do not \"make the world better\" but unfortunately must get built because humans are shitty to each other. Weapons are the obvious one, but not the only one. Often countries pass laws to encourage certain technologies or productions so as not to get outcompeted or outproduced by other countries.The argument here about AI is exactly this sort of argument. If other countries build vastly superior AI by have fewer developmental restrictions, then your country maybe both at a military disadvantage but also at an economic disadvantage because you can be easily outproduced by countries using vastly more efficient technology.You must balance all the harms and benefits when making laws, including external to the country issues. reply sharemywin 8 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think the government is talking about AI for weapons. of course that will be allowed.

Just not make fake porn videos of them. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparentprev> ...but if you have a law and you’re opposed to it on the basis that “China will do it anyway”, you admit that’s stupid?That depends on what \"it\" is. If it&#x27;s slavery and the US but not China banning slavery causes there to be half as much slavery in the world as there would be otherwise, it would be stupid.But if it&#x27;s research and the same worldwide demand for the research results are there so you&#x27;re only limiting where it can be done, which only causes twice as much to be done in China if it isn&#x27;t being done in the US, you&#x27;re not significantly reducing the scope of the problem. You&#x27;re just making sure that any benefits of the research are in control of the country that can still do it.> Now, certainly there is a degree of naunce with regard to AI specifically; but the assertion that we will be “left behind” and “out competed by China” are not relevant to the discussion on laws regarding AI and AI development.Of course it is. You could very easily pass laws that de facto prohibit AI research in the US, or limit it to large bureaucracies that in turn become stagnant for lack of domestic competitive pressure.This doesn&#x27;t even have anything to do with the stated purpose of the law. You could pass a law requiring government code audits which cost a million dollars, and justify them based on any stated rationale -- you&#x27;re auditing to prevent X bad thing, for any value of X. Meanwhile the major effect of the law is to exclude anybody who can&#x27;t absorb a million dollar expense. Which is a bad thing even if X is a real problem, because that is not the only possible solution, and even if it was, it could still be that the cure is worse than the disease.Regulators are easily and commonly captured, so regulations tend to be drafted in that way and to have that effect, regardless of their purported rationale. Some issues are so serious that you have no choice but to eat the inefficiency and try to minimize it -- you can&#x27;t have companies dumping industrial waste in the river.But when even the problem itself is a poorly defined matter of debatable severity and the proposed solutions are convoluted malarkey of indiscernible effectiveness, this is a sure sign that something shady is being evaluated.A strong heuristic here is that if you&#x27;re proposing a regulation that would restrict what kind of code an individual could publish under a free software license, you&#x27;re the baddies. reply wokwokwok 10 hours agorootparent> Of course it is.

I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;re that ignorant.> If you want want to beat that, opposing responsible AI won’t do it.Not opposing it guarantees you lose though. reply wokwokwok 6 hours agorootparentI could be wrong; maybe what China does with its AI developments will significantly and drastically alter the current startup status quo for AI startups.Maybe the laws around AI will drastically impact the ability of startups to compete with foreign competitors.…but I can’t see that being likely.It seems to me that restricting chip technology has a much much more significant impact, along with a raft of other measures which are already in place.All I can see when I look closely at arguments from people saying this kind of stuff is people who want to make deep fakes, steal art and generate porn bots crying about it, and saying it not fair other people (eg. Japan, where this has been ruled legal, China for who knows what reason, mostly ignorance) are allowed to do it.I’m not sympathetic.I don’t believe that makes any difference to the progress on AGI.I don’t care if China out competes other countries on porn bots (I don’t think they will; they have a very strict set of rules around this stuff… but I’ll be generous and include Japan which probably will).You want the US to get AGI first?Well, explain specifically how you imagine open source (shared with the world) models, and open code sharing vs. everything being locked away in a Google&#x2F;Meta sandbox helps?Are you sure you’re arguing for the right side here? Shouldn’t you be arguing that the models should be secret so China can’t get them?Or are you just randomly waving your arms in the air about China without having read the original article?What are you even arguing for? Laws are bad… but sharing with China is also bad… but having rules about what you do is bad… but China will do it anyway… but fear mongering and locking models away in big corporations behind apis is bad… but China… or something…????It’s really not a compelling argument. reply xyzelement 11 hours agorootparentprev&#x2F;&#x2F; If China builds amazing AI tech (and they will) then the rest of the world will just use it.

Discussions about policy and regulation should differentiate these, but also consider implications of how this technology is developed and for what purpose it could be employed.We should definitely be developing AI to combat AI as it will most certainly be weaponized against us with greater frequency in the near future. reply xyzelement 9 hours agorootparentYes and I think it&#x27;s broader than that. For example, if a country uses AI to (say) optimize their education or their economy - they will \"run away\" from us.

You&#x27;re not waging anything just yet.Here&#x27;s the thing: the US didn&#x27;t win the OG Cold War by being, as &#x27;AnthonyMouse puts it upthread, \"the country that has an elected government and constitutional protections for human rights\" and \"having a stronger economy\". It won it by having a stronger economy, which it used to fuck half of the world up, in a low-touch dance with the Soviets that had both sides toppling democratic governments, funding warlords and dictatorships, and generally doing the opposite of protecting human rights. And at least through a part of that period, if an American citizen disagreed, or urged restraint and civility and democracy, they were branded a commie mutant spy traitor.My point here isn&#x27;t to pass judgement on the USA (and to be clear, I doubt things would&#x27;ve been better if the US let Soviets take the lead). Rather, it&#x27;s that when we&#x27;re painting the current situation as the next Cold War, then I think people have a kind of cognitive dissonance here. The US won the OG Cold War by becoming a monster, and not pulling any punches. It didn&#x27;t have long discussions about how to safely develop new technologies - it just went full steam ahead, showered R&D groups with money, while sending more specialists to fuck up another country to keep the enemy distracted. This wasn&#x27;t an era known for reasoned approach to progress - this was the era known for designing nuclear ramjets with zero shielding, meant to zip around the enemy land, irradiating villages and rivers and cities as they fly by, because fuck the enemy that&#x27;s why.I mean, if it is to happen, it&#x27;ll happen. But let&#x27;s not pretend you can keep Pax Americana by keeping your hands clean and being a nice democratic state. Or that whether being more or less serious about AI safety is relevant here. If it becomes a Cold War, both sides will just pull all the stops and rush full-steam to develop and weaponize AGI.--EDIT - an aside:If the history of both sides&#x27; space programs is any indication, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see the US building a world-threatening AGI out of GPT-4 and some duct tape.Take for example US spy satellites - say, the 1960s CORONA program. Less than a decade after Sputnik, no computers, with engineering fields like control theory being still under development - but they successfully pulled off a program that involved putting analog cameras in space on weird orbits, which would make ridiculously high-detail photos of enemy land, and then deorbit the film canisters, so they could be captured mid-air by a jet plane carrying a long stick. If I didn&#x27;t know better, I&#x27;d say we don&#x27;t have the technology today to make this work. The US did it in the 1960s, because it turns out you can do surprisingly much with surprisingly little, if you give creative people infinite budget, motivate them with basic \"it&#x27;s us vs. them\" story, and order them to win you the war.As impressive as such feats were (and there were plenty more), I don&#x27;t think we want to have the same level of focus and dedication applied to AI - if that&#x27;s a possibility, then I fear we&#x27;ve crossed the X-risk threshold already with the \"safe\" models we have now. replydang 11 hours agoparentprevOk, we&#x27;ve changed the URL to that from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;andrew-ng-google-brain-big-t....

The historical result of better tech always meant increased jobs and well-being. Today is the best time in human history to be alive by virtually every metric.3. AI has been such a massive boon to humanity and your everyday existence for years that questioning its public utility is frankly bewildering. reply dangerwill 13 hours agorootparent1. This gets trotted out constantly but this is not some known constant about how capitalist economies work. Just because we have more jobs now than we did pre-digital revolution does not mean all technologies have that effect on the jobs market (or even that the digital revolution had that effect). A tool that is aimed to entirely replace humans across many&#x2F;most&#x2F;all industries is quite different than previous technological advancements.2. This is outdated, life is NOT better now than at any other time. Life expectancy is going down in the US, there is vastly more economic inequality now than there was in the 60s, people broadly report much worse job satisfaction than they did in previous generations. The only metric you can really point to about now being better than the 90s is absolute poverty going down. Which is great, but those advancements are actually quite shallow on a per-person basis and are matched by declines in relative wealth for the middle 80% of people.3. ???

Current technological limits make it currently a hard sell.LLMs, viewed as general purpose simulators&#x2F;predictors, don&#x27;t necessarily have any agency or goals by themselves. There is nothing to say that they cannot be made to simulate an agent with its own goals, by humans - and possibly either by malice or by mistake. Model capabilities are the limiting factor right now, but with the rise of more capable uncensored models, it isn&#x27;t difficult to imagine a model attaining some degree of autonomy, or at least doing a lot of damage before imploding in on itself. reply bumby 14 hours agoparentprev>Bad acting humans with AI systems are the threatDoes this mean \"humans with bad motives\" or does it extend to \"humans who deploy AI without an understanding of the risk\"?I would say the latter warrants a discussion on the AI systems, if they make it hard to understand the risk due to opaqueness. reply TheOtherHobbes 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not either&#x2F;or.

I can easily see a situation where a bad acting algorithm alone wouldn&#x27;t have nearly so negative an effect, if it weren&#x27;t tuned precisely and persuasively to get more humans to do the work of increasing the global suffering of others for temporary individual gain.To be clear, I&#x27;m not sure LLMs and their near term derivatives are so incredibly clever, but I have confidence that many humans have a propensity for easily manipulated irrational destructive stupidity, if the algorithm feeds them what they want to hear. reply m463 12 hours agoparentprevIt reminds me of dog breeds.Some dogs get bad reputations, but humans are an intricate part of the picture. For example, German Shepherds are objectively dangerous, but have a good reputation because they are trained and cared for by responsible people such as for the police. reply jcutrell 14 hours agoparentprevI think this may be a little short sighted.AI “systems” are provided some level of agency by their very nature. That is, for example, you cannot predict the outcomes of certain learning models.We necessarily provide agency to AI because that’s the whole point! As we develop more advanced AI, it will have more agency. It is an extension of the just world fallacy, IMO, to say that AI is “just a tool” - we lend agency and allow the tool to train on real world (flawed) data.Hallucinations are a great example of this in an LLM. We want the machine to have agency to cite its sources… but we also create potential for absolute nonsense citations, which can be harmful in and of themselves, though the human on the using side may have perfectly positive intent. reply adventured 14 hours agoparentprev> Bad acting humans with AI systems are the threat, not the AI systems themselves.It&#x27;s worth noting this is exactly the same argument used by pro-gun advocates as it pertains to gun rights.

Priced at $60 for the 4GB variant, and $80 for its 8GB sibling (plus your local taxes), virtually every aspect of the platform has been upgraded, delivering a no-compromises user experience. Raspberry Pi 5 comes with new features, it’s over twice as fast as its predecessor, and it’s the first Raspberry Pi computer to feature silicon designed in‑house here in Cambridge, UK. Key features include: 2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 CPU VideoCore VII GPU, supporting OpenGL ES 3.1, Vulkan 1.2 Dual 4Kp60 HDMI® display output 4Kp60 HEVC decoder Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi® Bluetooth 5.0 / Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) High-speed microSD card interface with SDR104 mode support 2 × USB 3.0 ports, supporting simultaneous 5Gbps operation 2 × USB 2.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet, with PoE+ support (requires separate PoE+ HAT, coming soon) 2 × 4-lane MIPI camera/display transceivers PCIe 2.0 x1 interface for fast peripherals Raspberry Pi standard 40-pin GPIO header Real-time clock Power button In a break from recent tradition, we are announcing Raspberry Pi 5 before the product arrives on shelves. Units are available to pre-order today from many of our Approved Reseller partners, and we expect the first units to ship by the end of October. Watch Eben do some talking about Raspberry Pi 5 We’re incredibly grateful to the community of makers and hackers who make Raspberry Pi what it is; you’ve been extraordinarily patient throughout the supply chain issues that have made our work so challenging over the last couple of years. We’d like to thank you: we’re going to ringfence all of the Raspberry Pi 5s we sell until at least the end of the year for single-unit sales to individuals, so you get the first bite of the cherry. We’re also giving every print subscriber to The MagPi and HackSpace magazines a single-use code, giving them priority access to Raspberry Pi 5 hardware. Click those links to learn more about our Priority Boarding programme — and if you subscribe today, you can get your hands on a Priority Boarding pass too. Between now and the end of October, we’ll be running a series of regular articles and videos, focusing on different aspects of the platform. Keep checking in here. A little history Way back in June 2019, we launched Raspberry Pi 4, the first true PC-class Raspberry Pi computer. With a quad-core Arm Cortex-A72 processor clocked at 1.5GHz, it was roughly forty times faster than the original Raspberry Pi model from 2012. In many ways the timing was perfect: in March the following year, schools closed, and millions of schoolchildren around the world were sent to study from home. Tens of thousands of them were able to rely on a Raspberry Pi 4 as their primary PC. Watch Raspberry Pi 5 show you all of its bits without talking In the four years since then, Raspberry Pi 4, and its derivatives Raspberry Pi 400 and Compute Module 4, have become firm favourites of enthusiasts, educators, and professional design engineers worldwide. Modern Raspberry Pi 4 computers run 20% faster than the launch variant, with a core clock speed of 1.8GHz. And, despite the well publicised challenges that have affected the electronics supply chain over the last two years, we’ve made and sold over 14 million units of Raspberry Pi 4 in that time. But time doesn’t stand still, and neither does our community’s appetite for performance. And since 2016 — the era of Raspberry Pi 3 — we’ve been quietly working on a much more radical overhaul of the Raspberry Pi platform. Today, that effort bears fruit, with the launch of Raspberry Pi 5: compared to Raspberry Pi 4, we have between two and three times the CPU and GPU performance; roughly twice the memory and I/O bandwidth; and for the first time we have Raspberry Pi silicon on a flagship Raspberry Pi device. New platform, new chipset Three new chips, each designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi 5 program, come together to deliver a step change in performance. BCM2712 BCM2712 is a new 16-nanometer application processor (AP) from Broadcom, derived from the 28-nanometer BCM2711 AP which powers Raspberry Pi 4, with numerous architectural enhancements. At its heart is a quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76 processor, clocked at 2.4GHz, with 512KB per-core L2 caches, and a 2MB shared L3 cache. Cortex-A76 is three microarchitectural generations beyond Cortex-A72, and offers both more instructions per clock (IPC) and lower energy per instruction. The combination of a newer core, a higher clock speed, and a smaller process geometry yields a much faster Raspberry Pi, and one that consumes much less power for a given workload. Our newer, faster CPU is complemented by a newer, faster GPU: Broadcom’s VideoCore VII, developed here in Cambridge, with fully open source Mesa drivers from our friends at Igalia. An updated VideoCore hardware video scaler (HVS) is capable of driving two simultaneous 4Kp60 HDMI displays, up from single 4Kp60 or dual 4Kp30 on Raspberry Pi 4. A 4Kp60 HEVC decoder and a new Image Sensor Pipeline (ISP), both developed at Raspberry Pi, round out the multimedia subsystem. To keep the system supplied with memory bandwidth, we have a 32-bit LPDDR4X SDRAM subsystem, running at 4267MT/s, up from an effective 2000MT/s on Raspberry Pi 4. RP1 Previous Raspberry Pi generations were built on a monolithic AP architecture: while some peripheral functions were provided by an external device (the Via Labs VL805 USB controller and hub on Raspberry Pi 4, and the Microchip LAN951x and LAN7515 USB hub and Ethernet controller chips on earlier products), substantially all of the I/O functions were integrated into the AP itself. Fairly early in the history of Raspberry Pi, we realised that as we migrated the AP to progressively newer process nodes, this approach would eventually become both technically and economically unsustainable. Raspberry Pi 5, in contrast, is built on a disaggregated chiplet architecture. Here, only the major fast digital functions, the SD card interface (for board layout reasons), and the very fastest interfaces (SDRAM, HDMI, and PCI Express) are provided by the AP. All other I/O functions are offloaded to a separate I/O controller, implemented on an older, cheaper process node, and connected to the AP via PCI Express. RP1 is our I/O controller for Raspberry Pi 5, designed by the same team at Raspberry Pi that delivered the RP2040 microcontroller, and implemented, like RP2040, on TSMC’s mature 40LP process. It provides two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 interfaces; a Gigabit Ethernet controller; two four-lane MIPI transceivers for camera and display; analogue video output; 3.3V general-purpose I/O (GPIO); and the usual collection of GPIO-multiplexed low-speed interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C, I2S, and PWM). A four-lane PCI Express 2.0 interface provides a 16Gb/s link back to BCM2712. Under development since 2016, RP1 is by a good margin the longest-running, most complex, and (at $15 million) most expensive program we’ve ever undertaken here at Raspberry Pi. It has undergone substantial evolution over the years, as our projected requirements have changed: the C0 step used on Raspberry Pi 5 is the third major revision of the silicon. And while its interfaces differ in fine detail from those of BCM2711, they have been designed to be very similar from a functional perspective, ensuring a high degree of compatibility with earlier Raspberry Pi devices. DA9091 BCM2712 and RP1 are supported by the third new component of the chipset, the Renesas DA9091 “Gilmour” power-management IC (PMIC). This integrates eight separate switch-mode power supplies to generate the various voltages required by the board, including a quad-phase core supply, capable of providing 20 amps of current to power the Cortex-A76 cores and other digital logic in BCM2712. Like BCM2712, DA9091 is the product of a multi-year co-development effort. Working closely with the Renesas team in Edinburgh allowed us to produce a PMIC which is precisely tuned for our needs. And we were able to squeeze in two frequently requested features: a real-time clock (RTC), which can be powered by an external supercapacitor or a rechargeable lithium-manganese cell; and a PC-style power button, supporting hard and soft power-off and power-on events. Two other elements of the chipset have been retained from Raspberry Pi 4. The Infineon CYW43455 combo chip provides dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0 with Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE); while the chip itself is unchanged, it is provided with a dedicated switched power supply rail for lower power consumption, and is connected to BCM2712 by an upgraded SDIO interface which supports DDR50 mode for higher potential throughput. As before, Ethernet connectivity is provided by a Broadcom BCM54213 Gigabit Ethernet PHY; this now sits at a jaunty 45-degree angle, a first for Raspberry Pi, and a source of enduring disappointment for orthogonal-layout enthusiast and CTO (Software) Gordon Hollingworth. Form-factor evolution On the outside, Raspberry Pi 5 closely resembles its predecessors. But, while retaining the overall credit-card-sized footprint, we’ve taken the opportunity to update some elements of the design, to align with the capabilities of the new chipset. We’ve removed the four-pole composite video and analogue audio jack from the board. Composite video, now generated by RP1, is still available from a pair of 0.1”-spaced pads on the bottom edge of the board. We now sport a pair of FPC connectors, in the space formerly occupied by the four-pole jack and camera connector. These are four-lane MIPI interfaces, using the same higher-density pinout found on various generations of Compute Module I/O board; and they are bi-directional (transceiver) interfaces, meaning that each one can connect either to a CSI-2 camera or to a DSI display. The space on the left of the board formerly occupied by the display connector now contains a smaller FPC connector which provides a single lane of PCI Express 2.0 connectivity for high-speed peripherals. The Gigabit Ethernet jack has returned to its classic position in the bottom right corner of the board, after a brief sojourn in the top right on Raspberry Pi 4. And it’s brought with it the four-pin PoE connector, simplifying the board layout at the cost of a compatibility break with our existing PoE and PoE+ HATs. Finally, we’ve grown a pair of mounting holes for a heatsink, as well as JST connectors for the RTC battery (two pins), Arm debug and UART (three pins), and fan with PWM control and tacho feedback (four pins). Designed in Cambridge, manufactured in Wales Like all flagship Raspberry Pi products, Raspberry Pi 5 is built at the Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed, South Wales. We have been working with Sony since the launch of the first Raspberry Pi computer in 2012, and we’re firm believers in the benefits of manufacturing our products within a few hours’ drive of our engineering design centre in Cambridge: a decade of frequent interaction with the Sony team has helped us understand how to design products that can be built reliably, cheaply, and at massive scale. Raspberry Pi 5 marks the introduction of a number of manufacturing innovations. One of these is intrusive reflow for connectors, which improves the mechanical quality of the product, increases throughput, and eliminates the costly and energy-intensive selective- or wave-solder process from the production flow. Others include fully routed panel singulation for cleaner board edges, and a new approach to production test inspired by our experiences testing our RP2040 microcontroller at scale. Accessories, accessories, accessories Every new flagship Raspberry Pi product is accompanied by new accessories, and Raspberry Pi 5 is no exception. Layout changes, new interfaces, and much higher peak performance (and a smaller increase in peak power consumption) have led us to redesign some existing accessories, and to develop some entirely new ones. Case The updated case for Raspberry Pi 5, priced at $10, builds on the aesthetic of its Raspberry Pi 4 predecessor, but adds a host of new usability and thermal-management features. An integrated 2.79 (max) CFM fan, with fluid dynamic bearings selected for low noise and an extended operating lifetime, connects to the four-pin JST connector on Raspberry Pi 5 to provide temperature‑controlled cooling. Air is drawn in through a 360‑degree slot under the lid, blown over a heatsink attached to the BCM2712 AP, and exhausted through connector apertures and vents in the base. We’ve lengthened the case, and tweaked the retention features, to make it possible to insert the Raspberry Pi 5 board without removing the SD card. And by removing the top of the case, it is now possible to stack multiple cases, as well as to mount HATs on top of the fan, using spacers and GPIO header extensions. Like all our plastic products, the new case is manufactured by our friends at T-Zero, in the West Midlands, UK. Active Cooler Raspberry Pi 5 has been designed to handle typical client workloads, uncased, with no active cooling. Users who wish to use the board uncased under continuous heavy load, without throttling, have the option of adding a $5 Active Cooler. This attaches to the board via two new mounting holes, and connects to the same four-pin JST connector as the case fan. A radial blower, again selected for low noise and extended operating lifetime, pushes air through an extruded and milled aluminium heatsink. Both the case and the Active Cooler are able to keep Raspberry Pi 5 well below the thermal throttle point for typical ambient temperatures and worst-case loads. The cooling performance of the Active Cooler is somewhat superior, making it particularly suitable for overclockers. 27W USB-C Power Supply Raspberry Pi 5 consumes significantly less power, and runs significantly cooler, than Raspberry Pi 4 when running an identical workload. However, the much higher performance ceiling means that for the most intensive workloads, and in particular for pathological “power virus” workloads, peak power consumption increases to around 12W, versus 8W for Raspberry Pi 4. When using a standard 5V, 3A (15W) USB-C power adapter with Raspberry Pi 5, by default we must limit downstream USB current to 600mA to ensure that we have sufficient margin to support these workloads. This is lower than the 1.2A limit on Raspberry Pi 4, though generally still sufficient to drive mice, keyboards, and other low‑power peripherals. For users who wish to drive high-power peripherals like hard drives and SSDs while retaining margin for peak workloads, we are offering a $12 USB-C power adapter which supports a 5V, 5A (25W) operating mode. If the Raspberry Pi 5 firmware detects this supply, it increases the USB current limit to 1.6A, providing 5W of extra power for downstream USB devices and 5W of extra on-board power budget: a boon for those of you who want to experiment with overclocking your Raspberry Pi 5. It should be noted that users have the option to override the current limit, specifying the higher value even when using a 3A adapter. In our testing, we have found that in this mode Raspberry Pi 5 functions perfectly well with typical configurations of higher-power USB devices, and all but the most pathological workloads. Camera and display cables The new, higher-density pinout of the MIPI connectors means that an adapter is required to connect our own cameras and displays, and third-party products, to Raspberry Pi 5. To support existing camera and display owners, we are offering FPC camera and display cables, which convert from the higher-density format (now referred to as “mini”) to the older lower-density format (now referred to as “standard”). These cables are available in 200mm, 300mm, and 500mm lengths, priced at $1, $2, and $3 respectively. Camera Module 3, the High-Quality Camera, the Global Shutter Camera, and the Touchscreen Display will all ship with both a standard-to-standard and a 200mm mini-to-standard cable. PoE+ HAT From early 2024, we will be offering a new PoE+ HAT. This supports the new location for the four-pin PoE header, and has an L-shaped form factor which allows it to sit inside the Raspberry Pi 5 case without interfering mechanically or disrupting airflow. Prototype PoE+ HAT. We don’t know yet what the production version will look like, but we do know that it won’t look like this. The new PoE+ HAT integrates a planar transformer into the PCB layout, and utilises an optimised flyback converter architecture to sustain high efficiency across the whole zero to 25W range of output powers. M.2 HATs One of the most exciting additions to the Raspberry Pi 5 feature set is the single-lane PCI Express 2.0 interface. Intended to support fast peripherals, it is exposed on a 16-pin, 0.5mm pitch FPC connector on the left-hand side of the board. From early 2024, we will be offering a pair of mechanical adapter boards which convert between this connector and a subset of the M.2 standard, allowing users to attach NVMe SSDs and other M.2-format accessories. The first, which conforms to the standard HAT form factor, is intended for mounting larger devices. The second, which shares the L-shaped form factor of the new PoE+ HAT, supports mounting 2230- and 2242-format devices inside the Raspberry Pi 5 case. Prototype M.2 HAT. Final hardware will not look like this. Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide, 5th Edition Sporting a brand-new look and feel, and priced at RRP £19.99 ($24.99), this new edition of our bestselling Raspberry Pi Beginner’s Guide is the definitive manual for Raspberry Pi computers and accessories. It has been comprehensively updated to cover Raspberry Pi 5, and the upcoming release of Raspberry Pi OS based on Debian Bookworm. RTC battery Last, but very much not least, we have sourced a Panasonic lithium manganese rechargeable coin cell, with a pre-fitted two-pin JST plug and an adhesive mounting pad. This is priced at $5, and is suitable for powering the Raspberry Pi 5 real-time clock (RTC) when the main power supply is disconnected. A newer, better Raspberry Pi OS In parallel with the final stages of the Raspberry Pi 5 programme, our software team has been busy developing a new version of Raspberry Pi OS, the official first-party operating system for Raspberry Pi devices. This is based on the most recent release of Debian (and its derivative Raspbian), codenamed “Bookworm”, and incorporates numerous enhancements, notably the transition from X11 to the Wayfire Wayland compositor on Raspberry Pi 4 and 5. Raspberry Pi OS will launch in mid-October, and will be the sole supported first-party operating system for Raspberry Pi 5. Keep checking back here: we’ll be telling you some more about the new OS, and you’ll be able to download it shortly before Raspberry Pi 5 arrives on the shelves in late October.

Reply to PhilE Pat 28th September 2023, 4:26 pm The problem is, you don’t listen to your customers. You’re are manufacturing PIs for the commercial market listening to their demands. You claim and $80 device which will more than likely be sold out for years to come and if you can get one, the price will be north of $200. Hard pass for me and I’m sure others. Reply to Pat Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 4:50 pm Can we hold off on the predictions about how awful everything is going to be until people have actually bought one? Reply to Liz Upton Tap 28th September 2023, 5:20 pm The point Pat is making is that it’s nearly impossible for *people* to buy one. They all get sold to corporations. D Smith 29th September 2023, 8:22 am It will be interesting to see just how close to reality your £200 prediction comes. Would be lovely if it really turned out to be £80 and if supply didn’t create a real black market. I see a real hunger for the Pi 5 and designing it is only the first step, but to market in demand volumes at £80 !! now that is a ‘Muskarian’ challenge that has bedeviled the Pi team since the very first little gem that graced my desk.

The Pi 5 is even more of a real computer than Pi 4 was, and running the desktop across two monitors is something worth trying. Reply to PhilE Sanjin Ganić 28th September 2023, 9:39 am Sorry, but it seems like you didn’t get the point. Let me rephrase – Why would I need to always carry mHDMI adapter with my Pi? One full HDMI + mHDMI would be a perfect solution. I am aware of space constraints, but I expected RPI team will find a way and make Pi5 more “consumer friendly”. On Pi4, I mitigated that “mistake” by buying Argon One case, which allows me to use it as a small portable computer compatible with all displays without without worry about any adapter cables. Reply to Sanjin Ganić Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 11:12 am What you call an adaptor cable I call a cable. The only disadvantage of having full-sized HDMI on end and micro-HDMI on the other is that you have to get it the right way round, but most people seem to manage. And it’s smaller, which may be a disadvantage if you have a thing for chunky connectors. Reply to PhilE Ben Pietras 28th September 2023, 12:22 pm So, the Pi4 already moved away from full hdmi ports… but you were expecting the Pi5 to move back? Micro hdmi is tiny and does a great job. Kind of the point of a Raspberry Pi.. Reply to Ben Pietras Sanjin Ganić 28th September 2023, 1:34 pm Sure! If product is intended for consumer market (and Pi4/Pi5 are targeting exactly that – small computers), why not make it then fully compatible with globally available consumer devices (TV’s, displays)? Craig Taylor 28th September 2023, 6:15 pm Micro HDMI connectors are not as robust. I lose connection and have to jiggle them sometimes. It gets annoying. Hanif 28th September 2023, 12:48 pm I’m sure there will be a new case at some point to give you the full size HDMI that you crave. Reply to Hanif Sanjin Ganić 28th September 2023, 1:28 pm Of course it will be, there are always people who know to listen voice of customers and earn on that :) I don’t know what is situation in Western Europe and USA, but in this part of world, if you forget mHDMI->HDMI adapter cable (I am travelling a lot because I am expat), you’re screwed. Because it’s that not easy to find it in stores here – nobody is using that. Mike Morrow 28th September 2023, 11:29 pm There are cables with mini and micro HDMI on them so no adapter needed. Easy l, yes. Slight expense? Yes. I don’t find it a bother. W. H. Heydt 29th September 2023, 1:05 am When I travel, I carry a 15.6″ portable monitor. Looks kind of like a giant tablet. It uses USB-C for power and *mini*-HDMI for video input. So with it, I carry a zip lock bag that contains: monitor PSU, USB-A to USB-C (power) cable, HDMI to mini-HDMI cable, and micro-HDMI to mini-HDMI cable. That way, it’s all contained and I’m ready for anything. Reply to W. H. Heydt David 29th September 2023, 12:34 am UART socket? Eee bah gum! I’ve not seen one o’ those since me old times wi ‘t Z80.

Reply to Michael Kelly Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 9:13 am There is no impact on existing drivers because each of those interfaces you mentioned gets a completely new driver which, thanks to Linux’s driver models, slot right in. Reply to PhilE aBUGSworstnightmare 28th September 2023, 10:27 am … but requires a change of existing overlays (i.e. as PWM/GPIOs are no longer part of the SoC because they’ve move to RP1), right? Reply to aBUGSworstnightmare 6by9 28th September 2023, 11:13 am As long as you’re using aliases rather than explicit paths to nodes, then almost all of those just transfer. There is a slight change around CSI and DSI as each connector now has a dedicated I2C bus, but GPIO, I2S and PWM, should all be the same. Reply to 6by9 Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 11:14 am Backwards compatibility has been maintained as much as possible – many overlays will work unmodified. Reply to PhilE Tovli 10th October 2023, 7:31 pm My robot used wiringpi to bit-bang clock stretching I2C in bullseye, and not available in bookworm. Does RP1 implement true clock stretching I2C? Reply to Tovli Kainomad 28th September 2023, 8:48 am Great specs, great price, great conception, as always but i would rather see another usb-c with display-port alternate mode than 2 mini-hdmi (also would have been great for data) . Also are 2 cameras ports necessary ? Why not use a hat for this and embed a m.2 directly on board or direct PoE compatibility? Or even a SIM card reader ? Reply to Kainomad Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 9:01 am For the small board area required, adding the option of 2 cameras, 2 DSI displays, or 1 camera and 1 display is going to be very popular. Adding an M.2 socket would increase the height of the board significantly – you’d have to fit it on the bottom to avoid blocking the fan/ambient air circulation. Reply to PhilE Kainomad 28th September 2023, 9:16 am I guess I’m not part of the popular kids’ team ;) Thank you for your answer. Great job and great ideas! I really like the PWM, UART/Arm debug and JST additions. Can’t wait to get this baby.

Jeff Geerling 28th September 2023, 8:55 am Thank you for this comprehensive peek behind the board’s features and development… so many little details about the RP1 and the new architecture—I only hope we can see even more bandwidth and more refinements to RP1 in it’s next iteration. Glad it’s finally seeing the light of day in a real product! Reply to Jeff Geerling Alex Ivanovs 28th September 2023, 8:55 am Great work, team! Reply to Alex Ivanovs Richard Eric 28th September 2023, 8:57 am Nice upgrade. Good to see the same footprint. The form factor of the RPi is just about perfect. I had hoped that the RP2040 was going to be added like how the iMX7 has an M4 co-processor. For embedded stuff it’s a big win. But I guess would make the silicon too big or pricy. Maybe next time. ;) Reply to Richard Eric Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 9:06 am RP1 and RP2040 are not quite sister chips, but definitely cousins, and RP1 does have some PIO capabilities – something we are hoping to expose to Linux and application code over the coming months. Reply to PhilE BrianW 28th September 2023, 9:44 am Could you expand on what the PIO capabilities are please? For me, PIO has been the defining feature of the RP2040, and I was coming to the comments to say I was disappointed see no mention of it in the RP1. I had been hoping that PIO could be integrated into the RPi GPIO, and the RP1, designed by the same team as the RP2040, seemed like a missed opportunity to include this excellent feature, until I saw your comment. Reply to BrianW James Adams 28th September 2023, 10:51 am RP1 has an internal subsystem that predates RP2040 and is primarily designed for system management purposes. It does have PIO but is not quite the same as RP2040 PIO, we are looking at whether we can put togheter a nice way to expose it without falling over ‘my RP2040 PIO stuff doesn’t “just work” on RP1’ type issues. Reply to James Adams Luke Wren 28th September 2023, 11:42 am There is one PIO instance (4 state machines). It’s identical to the PIO blocks on RP2040, except the FIFO depth is doubled. It has single-cycle bus access from the dual Cortex-M3 management processors on RP1, and the PIO FIFOs can also be accessed from the host processor (2712) over PCIe, but the PIO configuration registers are only accessible to the RP1 processors. One of RP1’s Cortex-M3s is currently going spare, so it should be possible to write your own Cortex-M firmware and load it into the 16 kB per-Cortex-M3 private SRAM. There won’t be any software support for this at launch though. Reply to Luke Wren BrianW 28th September 2023, 12:36 pm Thank you, and James too triss64738 on the forums 28th September 2023, 6:14 pm That sounds rather nice. Is there any chance the RP1 (or a similar chip) will be released as a standalone? It could be useful for high-bandwidth applications (I myself had almost used the RP2040 for interfacing with a >100Msps ADC, or emulating an LCD screen), but the USB1.1 bandwidth limitations of the RP2040 meant I had to resort to chips >10x as expensive. DrDnar 28th September 2023, 10:41 pm That’s great and very exciting information! My first thought when I saw the Pi5 news was, “That thing had better have a PIO block!” I’m glad to see it’s there even if the software support isn’t quite ready yet. As an embedded software person myself, I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect that RP2040 stuff could “just work” on the RP1. The fact that the RP1 is a chip with very a different purpose not directly connected to the host CPUs makes writing drivers for it a lot different. For example, on the RP2040 you can have very tightly bounded latency between the CPUs and a PIO block, which is impossible to get with the main A76 cores, never mind over a chip-to-chip bus. I think it’s reasonable (perhaps necessary) to tell people that PIO programs for the RP1 will need to be adapted to work with the Linux kernel. I’m also curious to see accessible main system RAM is from the RP1 and how DMAs between the chips work, as I suspect that’s really going to be what makes or breaks custom high-bandwidth interfaces. I’m guessing you might end up coordinating two levels of DMA: one from the SoC/DDR4 to RP1, and one from the internal RP1 RAM to the PIO block. I really look forward to reading the documentation on the RP1 when it becomes available! Chad Page 30th September 2023, 10:09 pm Does the RP1 support ‘raw’ output to the composite ADC? I’ve been looking for a good raw composite output for my low-level laserdisc decoder for quite a while now… Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 1st October 2023, 5:01 pm We’re going to be doing an in-depth video about RP1 here some time over the next few weeks: watch this space. Leah 29th September 2023, 12:50 am Oooh, I can’t wait to play with it! The whole PIO concept is a massive gamechanger. It completely changed how I think about peripherals, and I really dread having to work with MCUs without a PIO in the future. I wouldn’t be too surprised if someone came up with a chip which had a dozen PIO cores and just dropped all the legacy IP. When you can get the same result by loading a bitstream into a PIO, why bother hardwiring any protocol? Reply to Leah Cbj 28th September 2023, 9:55 am The write up.mentions the RP1 is designed using principles from the RP2040 so you never know there may be an Easter Egg there… But yes being able to have some basic microcontroller style watchdog processes running that can kick in the main board when needed, that could be very useful Reply to Cbj zal 28th September 2023, 9:02 am Very disappointed in 1x PCI Express and an m2 HAT that makes it impossible to fit a proper heatsink and fan. That severely handicaps it in comparison to RK3588 based options such as the Orange Pi 5 Plus. Too bad, I was looking forward to Raspberry Pi matching the competition. Reply to zal Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 9:09 am I have a Pi 5 with a prototype M.2 HAT and cooling fan running happily on my desk. I looked up the price of the “competition” and nearly choked on my coffee. Reply to PhilE zal 28th September 2023, 1:05 pm How much did you pay for your Pi 5 and m2 HAT, Phil? Choke all you want. Not all Pi customers are in the UK – for customers outside your borders the price difference might not be that big, especially not if you factor in the additional cost of an m2 hat. Reply to zal David 29th September 2023, 12:48 am I just checked the price of the Orange 8GB on Amazon.com. $128 excluding shipping and taxes. Unless you like binary numbers, Raspberry Pi 5 is cheaper by a wide margin, even with $5 for active cooling. And I’m sure we’ll see a $64 bundle for the binarists soon… Reply to David Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 9:13 am The active cooler is $5, as you’ll see from the post you’re replying to.

Reply to David David 29th September 2023, 1:18 am I don’t know exactly which power supply you mean, but my 140W MacBook power supply costs 7 times more than the Pi for a bit less than six times the power. Still a very impressive achievement for a $12 power supply. Can you say how efficient it is? Reply to David Taylor 28th September 2023, 6:45 pm I wish the Pi itsself had those PD capabilities. I don’t think I’ve seen a power supply that can do over 3A on any voltage under 20V, so having 9V input to the Pi would open the amount of power supplies from 1 to ∞ (ok, not quite) Reply to Taylor Andrew Waite 28th September 2023, 9:16 am Looks awesome. The micro rather than full size HDMI connectors is disappointing though. Reply to Andrew Waite Chris 28th September 2023, 11:02 pm I will buy the Argon One case that is a brilliant heat sink and puts all ports at the back whilst conveying the HDMI ports to full size ones. Issue solved. Reply to Chris Alex Ellis 28th September 2023, 9:17 am Congrats to the team, this is a wonderful upgrade for I/O and overall performance. I shared my testing via Twitter, feel free to check out the benchmarks and pictures. https://x.com/alexellisuk/status/1707296079849365650?s=20 Reply to Alex Ellis Ian Hollis 28th September 2023, 9:17 am Congratulations on hitting a SIX once again. You folks are feeding my SBC (RPi specifically) obsession. Keep it up. I hope there’ll be sufficient produced to feed the obvious demand which you’ll generate. Perhaps RPi 4s will reduce in price to reasonable. :-) Reply to Ian Hollis Sergio Costas 28th September 2023, 9:25 am Looks awesome! But about the MIPI connectors… will they be limited to the current screens, or we would be able to connect others? I ask because I have a 1920×480 screen with a dual-MIPI interface (the cable has, literally, two independent MIPI signals), and I was wondering if I would be able to power it directly from the MIPI connectors instead of having to use the current HDMI adapter, which is a nuisance. Reply to Sergio Costas James Hughes 28th September 2023, 9:54 am The latest graphics stack (KMS) has allowed the use of third-party DSI displays for a while, as long as you have the right driver. Reply to James Hughes Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 10:16 am Annoyingly, MIPI is a lot more complex than nice things like HDMI. Even people with experience making displays have trouble getting all the commands and signals exactly correct. Plus in general, you need a £17k scope to debug it!!! Reply to Gordon Hollingworth aBUGsworstnightmare 28th September 2023, 10:49 am Sure it is dual channel MIPI and not dual-lane (as what would be sufficient for 1920x480pixels)? Also asked the question if RPI offers possibility for Dual-Channel MIPI-DSI; thinking of high-res DSI displays and FPD-Link III Bridge Serializer with Video Splitting (3k/2k) here Reply to aBUGsworstnightmare 6by9 28th September 2023, 11:20 am No, there is no support for dual interface displays. They are two discrete DSI interfaces, and show up under Linux as two distinct DRM devices. This is why I commented on the forums about Wayfire handling multiple DRM cards nicely – we’re relying on it here as DSI1/DSI2/DPI/VEC are 4 DRM devices, plus a 5th for vc4. Yes, I have had 5 displays running simultaneously (I didn’t hook up composite). Substituting DPI for an SPI display also works incredibly well. Reply to 6by9 aBUGSworstnightmare 28th September 2023, 1:19 pm Thanks for letting us know! I’m sure prepared to test Pi5 with 5 screens once I can buy one/get it at hands. Sorry, but I don’t understand the meaning of ‘Substituting DPI for an SPI display also works incredibly well’! Reply to aBUGSworstnightmare 6by9 28th September 2023, 2:12 pm Both 2 x HDMI, 2 x DSI, and 1 x DPI, and 2 x HDMI, 2 x DSI, and 1 x SPI have been tested and work. Seeing as you can use multiple chip selects and SPI buses, you could create a tiled desktop with multiple SPI displays. Don’t expect a fantastic refresh rate though (I wouldn’t try watching video on it). manuti 28th September 2023, 9:26 am Congratulations to the whole team!!! Reply to manuti Simon Monk 28th September 2023, 9:26 am A fantastic and well thought out update to the Pi. This is now an extremely good desktop replacement machine. Reply to Simon Monk Geoff 28th September 2023, 9:28 am What I would like is active cooling + PoE + M.2 support. Reply to Geoff Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 9:42 am You can do that. As you can see if you read the post you’re replying to, you can stack the active cooler with hats – which will include PoE and M.2. Reply to Liz Upton supdude 28th September 2023, 10:06 am All the post says is that you can mount HATs on top of the case fan He is talking about the active cooler, which is not specified in the post if a HAT can be mounted on top or not without the use os gpio spacers Reply to supdude James Adams 28th September 2023, 11:00 am With an appropriate GPIO spacer and 15mm standoffs you can stack HATs above the Active Cooler – works very nicely. Reply to James Adams Raspberry Pi Staff Ashley Whittaker 28th September 2023, 9:43 am You mean like the Active Cooler mentioned in the post? Reply to Ashley Whittaker Mehmet Aksoy 28th September 2023, 9:35 am Congratulations to all! Reply to Mehmet Aksoy Jamie Whitehorn 28th September 2023, 9:37 am Congratulations on the new version 🎉 Really pleased to see the inclusion of the new PCI Express connector. Can’t wait to see what the partner community does with this. Reply to Jamie Whitehorn Jarom Hatch 28th September 2023, 9:37 am Does the USB-C port have USB3 host support now rather than USB2? Reply to Jarom Hatch Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 10:28 am No, the USB-C is the same dwc-otg peripheral as before, it’s the most reliable one we have (we’ve now been using it for 12 years)… Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Michal Tarovsky 28th September 2023, 9:38 am Is it a Secure Platform? Will I be able to run Android TV with HW keys for Widevine L1? Reply to Michal Tarovsky Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 10:29 am No, it does not have a full TrustZone security implementation. As such it’s not really possible to gain a full Widevine certification. Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Sean Gilligan 11th October 2023, 5:49 pm When you say “full TrustZone support” is not present, what is missing? (I’m hoping you just mean the locked bootloader is missing.) Is there (or will there be) documentation about what TrustZone (hardware) support is provided? Is it the same as on the 3/4 or has memory protection been added? Reply to Sean Gilligan drich 28th September 2023, 9:39 am Did just read somewhere that there is no hardware video encoding, is it true ? That sounds strange as it would means poor performances for real-time applications Reply to drich Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 10:36 am Ok, this is a big one… The problem is that video encoding is not a standard. You can put as much or as little effort into encoding as you like, on Pi 1, 2, 3, & 4 the encoding quality (for the bitrate) was relatively poor. The nice thing about using the processors to do this is you get to choose exactly what balance between quality and bitrate you want. Obviously, the bad thing is the power consumption, but actually it only takes around 1 processor to encode 1080p60 with our default settings (which is still better quality than the PI 4 hardware encoder). We think it might be possible with the right settings to be able to hit 4K encode at around 24fps, but we’ve not been optimising in that direction yet. In future we’ll have to do something, but for Pi 5 we feel the hardware encode is a mm^2 too far. Reply to Gordon Hollingworth drich 28th September 2023, 11:02 am Thank you for the detailed reply. Surprised that it can be done with onlyallowing for high resolution DSI displays? Reply to aBUGsworstnightmare 6by9 28th September 2023, 11:28 am Answered above, but no they are two discrete DSI interfaces. With each running at up to 1.5Gbit/s/lane it can go somewhat beyond the 1080p60 limit of the older SoCs though. Reply to 6by9 Brian Beuken 28th September 2023, 10:14 am Wow this is exciting, my order is in, can’t wait. Though I am a bit worried about the loss of X11 to Wayland, Ive never quite got my head around that, but I guess this will force some new learning. Reply to Brian Beuken Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 11:05 am In the long run, this is going to make everything better across all Pi devices. I am hoping to one day be able to send video images through the operating system directly to the hardware to put onto the screen, no longer converting them From YUV wallpaper mode to RGB tiled to be composed with the 3D into a buffer which might even then need to be converted back to a linear (untiled) mode and then pushed out the display… My target is 1080p30 in a window on Pi 1 :) Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Ben Pietras 28th September 2023, 12:33 pm Wayland has been working great for a while now. I use sway for my daily driver and (aside from using x2go) it works well with everything. Reply to Ben Pietras Shivam 28th September 2023, 10:20 am This is great news. Can’t wait to get my hands dirty. Reply to Shivam Dale 28th September 2023, 10:24 am Having followed these things from the beginning and probably owning 1 if not 2 of most models, I think its amazing how far these little devices have come! I think there are 2 questions here though: 1) Will there be a RPi500 to replace the 400? 2) from a point of pricing, these are amazing little devices, but they do seem to be stepping away from the affordable devices of a few years ago, even the Zero2 is now 3 times more expensive than the original Zero, will this created accessibility problems or are there plans to fit in an ‘inbetween’ model? Something which gives you most of the ports so all USB/ethernet, maybe only 1 hdmi, less base ram and a few other things less like no pci connector or RTC stuff, to essentially strip out component cost, which still make it a better fully fledged version than a Zero, but more affordable than a flagship? Reply to Dale Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 10:42 am This is a $5 increase over the equivalent Pi 4 models – we think that’s actually pretty good for a >2x increase in performance and a number of new features, and if you’re particularly price-sensitive, all the predecessor models are still available. Reply to Liz Upton Dale 28th September 2023, 12:36 pm I probably have enough already :) I guess I was thinking of the fact that in the earlier days when the Zero came out, there was essentially a £5, £20 and £30 model, where the range topper was £30 and that stuff generally held its price well until Raspberry Pi 4, where the ram just seemed to inflate the cost a fair bit. I loved how fully fledged yet cheaply disposable the Rpi Zero was when it was £5. I have seen you can still get some models some times, do you actually still produce all the earlier models as components become available? I guess everyone always wants more for less dosh these days. I’ve just been quite happy with the Zero, but having lots of extra power gives possibility for so many things! Reply to Dale Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 12:41 pm We do, yes. rpilocator.com is your friend! Reply to Liz Upton Sumanta Das 28th September 2023, 10:26 am Will there be 16GB model coming? Reply to Sumanta Das nafanz 28th September 2023, 10:34 am Wow! This is the best news today. Reply to nafanz Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 11:27 am And hopefully tomorrow? Reply to Gordon Hollingworth nafanz 29th September 2023, 6:39 am Yes. I also want to believe that in the near future you will announce a version with 16 GB of RAM and an updated RPi 500. Then it will be a bomb. Reply to nafanz Bouarfa MAHI 28th September 2023, 10:39 am Hello, is there a datasheet available for the Raspberry Pi 5? I need information on the exact positions of the Ethernet port and power button for customizing a 3D-printed case Thanks Reply to Bouarfa MAHI Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 10:43 am Not yet, but it’ll be available when the hardware itself is available.

Sounds great! I’ve placed a pre-order already and I’m looking forward to having a go once it arrives through the door. Reply to Stewart Watkiss Tally 28th September 2023, 10:52 am A great update, looking forward to getting it but one question. Is the Pi 5 a “proper” Arm PC ? By that I mean does it have UEFI support out of the box that adheres to the Arm system ready standard so we can use any general ARM64 compatible operating system [similar to x86 UEFI] or is it still limited to uboot and its tailored OS images. Thank you. Reply to Tally Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 11:29 am The bootloader doesn’t support UEFI, it’s a bit too much to fit into the EEPROM along with everything else. I don’t know if there’s a minimal UEFI implementation, but it does seem like UEFI is quite large. Reply to Gordon Hollingworth M. Mediouni 28th September 2023, 12:14 pm U-Boot nowadays has a UEFI implementation available. Can you tell the size of the EEPROM? Is it 128KB like previous RPi generations? Reply to M. Mediouni James Adams 28th September 2023, 12:40 pm 16GBit (2MByte) Reply to James Adams M. Mediouni 28th September 2023, 12:51 pm I understand that to be 16Mbit instead of Gbit :) Depending on how much is taken by the firmware, that’s way more than enough space to fit in a U-Boot UEFI-compatible implementation with some ACPI tables (preferably if that PCIe controller is ECAM compliant). I wonder if Raspberry Pi would be interested by such a project. Tally 28th September 2023, 4:10 pm Thank you for the reply. I understand the limits and price points to get it to ship. Maybe one day we could see a deluxe Pi 5, with the hardware mounted on a mini-ITX motherboard with all the I/O PCI-e etc and a UEFI bootloader. Reply to Tally Lukáš Říha 29th September 2023, 7:51 pm There actually is a project trying to provide UEFI for Rpi4, https://github.com/pftf/RPi4 . Is larger than current EEPROM size as stated below, but I imagine it could be optimized for size.

Reply to PhilE Ignas Kiela 28th September 2023, 10:57 am Does RP1 emulate SMI(Secondary Memory Interface) that HATs like CaribouLite use for high-speed data transfer? Reply to Ignas Kiela Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 11:31 am That should be possible in the future with a suitable PIO driver. There is a PIO implementation and we’re hoping to develop a nice Linux driver and some userland tools for it. But we’re not there yet! Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Ignas Kiela 28th September 2023, 1:43 pm PIO!? You got me very interested :) Reply to Ignas Kiela Joe Fongo 28th September 2023, 11:09 am Does the power button support instant on/off like a cell phone? Or will the pi still need 30s to boot each time? Reply to Joe Fongo Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 11:35 am The power button currently triggers a full boot or shutdown – booting to the desktop is under 30 seconds. In future it may support a low power suspend mode which will boot much more rapidly, but until it actually works I can’t promise it. Reply to PhilE thagrol 28th September 2023, 12:42 pm The only thing instantly powered on/off by your phone’s power button is the screen. Everything else is still running otherwise you’d not be abel to recieve calls. Reply to thagrol Giovanni Rito Russo 28th September 2023, 11:09 am I know realvnc doesn’t support “Wayland” as I read that debian Bookworm will be released with Wayfire Wayland composer, what system will Pios use? always realvnc with wayland support or other software? Reply to Giovanni Rito Russo Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 11:11 am Right now we’re recommending WayVNC on the server end, and TigerVNC on the client end. There will be plenty of documentation available around VNC – watch this space! Reply to Liz Upton Giovanni Rito Russo 28th September 2023, 11:14 am So in raspi-config we will no longer find the active realvnc entry? Do we have to manually install compatible software? in debian 12? Reply to Giovanni Rito Russo Raspberry Pi Staff Gordon Hollingworth 28th September 2023, 11:39 am We do have contact with the WayVNC developer but this won’t give the ability to remotely access your Pi as RealVNC does. We’re hoping it will start working, now they have a full example of how to port to Wayland, but it will take time. Reply to Gordon Hollingworth Robin Davies 30th October 2023, 10:06 pm > [WayVNC, doesn’t support remote access like RealVNC does] I’m hard pressed to imagine what VNC support means if it doesn’t mean supporting remote access. So is there a solution for remote access to headless device? Specifically, is there a solution for connecting to a headless Pi running bookworm from a Windows computer? Reply to Robin Davies meltwater 28th September 2023, 11:16 am Wow the little RPi has grown.

Reply to meltwater Kumar Abhishek 28th September 2023, 11:24 am Awesome, congratulations! This is great and I am looking forward to buy one when it’s available. I am curious if BCM2712 retains the SMI (secondary memory interface) that was present on the earlier silicon. Reply to Kumar Abhishek Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 11:37 am Not directly, but see Gordon’s answer above: https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-raspberry-pi-5/?trashed=1&ids=1594104#comment-1594103 Reply to PhilE Kumar Abhishek 28th September 2023, 1:38 pm I read Luke’s comment about the PIO architecture on the RP1 and it seems really interesting! On the Pico, only 30 pins are connected externally to the PIO even though it seems to have 32 pins for itself as per the block documentation in the Pico datasheet. So are all 32 pins contiguously available on a PIO block brought out on the 40-pin header? Just curious – because by default only 28 GPIOs are available on the 40-pin header and I assume you will maintain backward compatibility on the header.

Reply to Chris Stagg Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 11:54 am Hi Chris! It did feel like pre-announcing would give the most people the most opportunity to get their hands on one on day one! As usual, I’m afraid we can’t comment on future releases (apart from the one in the headline), so I’m going to gliiiiide past your question. :) Reply to Liz Upton Chris Stagg 30th September 2023, 10:02 am After a couple of days, and a bit more comment reading (in multiple forums), I sense hope for RP1’s solo act. Reply to Chris Stagg Lee Gibson 28th September 2023, 11:51 am Fantastic job guys, great news on the RTC, this was a real bug bear for remotely deployed system that was required to to rebooted every xx days or hours in know down time periods. So many other improvements too! I use the Pi4 for industrial product development (poettnially at large volumes) and a solution which is incredibly cost sensitive. I use HD video as a key function and my solution does not require much RAM (runs okay on 512MB), but it does need network and masses of connectivity via USB. I could use the Zero 2 from a cost perspective (it will work on that), but lack of network and USB ports makes it non viable. Pi 5 at 4Gb and 8gb prices are great but are too expensive. So bottom line, will we see 1GB and 2GB versions around the Pi 4 equivalent price? And yes I could use the Pi4 for now but eventually Pi will replace and we will be ascending the cost curve by default without Pi5 1GB and 2GB. I appreciate you are stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to be all things to all people, I just hope the hunt for ‘PC use’ status does not overshadow the well connected, low cost credentials that only a Pi with smaller memory offers and always has, in fact it is what it was born for!

Reply to Lee Gibson Gray 28th September 2023, 11:58 am This is a really amazing upgrade and I’m really looking forward to trying it out. Side note, when the inevitable CM5 drops a year or so from now, please, please make the new carrier board mount directly to ATX chassis like a VIA APC or similar. The only ATX carriers that came out for the CM4 were £200 cluster boards. I just need the standard one but slightly wider with different hole placement.

Reply to Erwin Raspberry Pi Staff Alasdair Allan 28th September 2023, 12:42 pm As mentioned in the post we’re currently working on a new release of Raspberry Pi OS based on the most recent release of Debian, codenamed “Bookworm.” This new version of Raspberry Pi OS will launch in mid-October, and you’ll be able to download it shortly before Raspberry Pi 5 arrives on the shelves in late-October. Reply to Alasdair Allan Lee Gibson 28th September 2023, 1:11 pm Hi Alastair, I think the question was, will Pi 5 still run Bullseye? And further to that, for my purposes will Pi 5 it still run Buster? Reply to Lee Gibson Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 1:15 pm No, you’ll need to be running Bookworm. Promise you’ll like it though. Reply to Liz Upton Lee Gibson 28th September 2023, 1:27 pm Ouch, that’s a killer for long term killer commercial/industrial applications like mine that rely Buster and cannot run on Bullseye or Bookworm (reliant on OMX Player as VLC does do what is needed and probably never will) once the Pi4 and Pi3 are no longer available :( Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 1:27 pm You’ve got plenty of time; we’re not going to be discontinuing Pi 4 until at least the 2030s. James Hughes 28th September 2023, 1:30 pm Lee, can you clarify why VLC or some combination of FFMPEG et al doesn’t do what you need? OMXplayer can never run on Pi5, so getting alternatives up and running is important to us. You can email applications@raspberrypi.com Javier Goldman 28th September 2023, 1:37 pm will current installations be updated? or do we need to do a clean install? Reply to Javier Goldman Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 1:44 pm Moving from Bullseye to Bookworm will require a clean install even more than the Buster to Bullseye transition. I think it will be less effort to move your customisations across than to upgrade an image in-place, and much less error-prone. Reply to PhilE Javier Goldman 28th September 2023, 3:10 pm is there any recommended way to backup my customizations? kinda still new to this Mark 28th September 2023, 12:47 pm Great to see the new raspberry pi 5. PCI express is also very good. I will add an external SSD. I will be using this device for home assistant. Will there also be a compute module 5? Or is that difficult due to a higher power consumption? Please do something about the distribution, so we don’t have to pay extra because the RPI 5 won’t be freely available in the market. But nice to see this new chip. Great work.

Reply to tek Raspberry Pi Staff Ashley Whittaker 28th September 2023, 1:52 pm YES! Here is a list of all the events you can get hands-on with Raspberry Pi 5: https://events.raspberrypi.com/experience-raspberry-pi-5 Reply to Ashley Whittaker W. H. Heydt 28th September 2023, 4:19 pm Thanks for the list. I see that the Maker Faire that is practically in my back yard–and for which I already have a ticket–will have Pi5s. Reply to W. H. Heydt Steffen 28th September 2023, 1:49 pm Interesting. I’m curious why you didn’t address a huge weak point, being the SD card, by introducing emmc storage? Reply to Steffen James Hughes 28th September 2023, 1:54 pm For the vast majority of people, SD cards are not a weak point, but a useful feature. On the Pi5 the SD card speed has doubled. You will be able to use M.2 SSDs on HAT in the future, you can already USB or network boot if you want. Reply to James Hughes Steffen 28th September 2023, 10:44 pm It’s fine to keep the SD card slot. But it is well known in the home assistant community, that if you run the os on an SD card, the card will inevitably crash. So to not improve on this is pretty crazy to me. Reply to Steffen W. H. Heydt 29th September 2023, 1:27 am Beside the fact that no storage medium lasts forever, given what has been said, your solution is: Pi5+case+M.2 HAT+*internal* NVMe SSD. I did a quick look earlier and you can get 256GB PCIe3*4 NVMe SSDs for less that $30. Set up that way and the whole unit is self-contained. Reply to W. H. Heydt Robert White 29th September 2023, 5:26 pm Never had an SD crash in many years of use always on. The SD crashes if are cheap or os isn’t properly configured. SD is a a standard with many different quality cards and technologies, some have also trim feature that makes them basically as wear resistant as a SSD hard disk. Reply to Robert White CooliPi 2nd October 2023, 1:16 am I’ve settled on SAMSUNG PRO Endurance cards, because other cards fail at reading (and eventually wear out) because of TLC or QLC architecture after some time. PRO Endurance is MLC. Supports TRIM (lsblk -D shows it can trim) and fstrim -v / can trim it (once a week is sufficient). SanDisk has an equivalent line of SD cards (also MLC). I don’t know which of them is better. Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 1:57 pm I find the removable storage to be a strength, not a weakness, since it allows easy switching between projects and encourages experimentation. The M.2 HAT will provide a higher performance, higher reliability alternative for those who feel the need. Reply to PhilE Sly 29th September 2023, 2:19 pm Exactly! Removable storage is a must. Not only it is more comfortable and allow to easily switch from a card to another to use a different OS image, configuration etc. But also increase the life of the board not forcing you to trash it because of NAND wearing. With more clue of the facts, many people would rather ask for a faster sd card standard (since it doesn’t even support UHS-II that now with SDUC and SD Express is 3 generations old) rather than emmc that would be a step back. Reply to Sly Sly 29th September 2023, 2:10 pm The emmc is not better than sdcard. This is an old myth built on the fact there are a lot of cheap poor quality sd card and a lot of cheap and old SD card reader on the market, not a problem of SD card standard itself. There are sd card with support to trim as SSD and very fast speed, not even mentioning SD Express readers and SDUC sdcard standards. Makes no sense to switch to emmc would be much better using just a newer SD card reader, that can take advantage of faster microsd. Reply to Sly Kelli 28th September 2023, 1:51 pm Ah, it’s too bad there isn’t any analog(ue) audio output on the board anymore. No more simple-build PiPod. Used to be that all that was needed was a small amplifier to boost the audio up from line level to more ‘oomph’ to drive higher-impedance headphones. Now there’ll have to be a DAC as well… and I don’t even know what it’ll connect to for the digital audio. Reply to Kelli Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 5:02 pm A cheap USB DAC would be the obvious choice, unless you absolutely need all 4 ports for something else (and no hub), or you can’t make it all fit. Reply to PhilE ardencaple 2nd October 2023, 5:06 pm It really depends on what you want – there are lots of audio HATs available. A couple of things to remember – the original analogue output wasn’t very HiFi – so if you want quality audio you need something else anyway. Also, if you are just using it as an audio output device, then you don’t need all the processing power of a pi 4/5. The Pi Zero 2W is ideal for this, especially when paired with the rpi codec zero hat, although that takes the combined price up to about the same as a Pi 4/5. Availability of the Z2W is taking a bit longer than promised to ramp up, but should be here soon. Reply to ardencaple Tim 28th September 2023, 1:52 pm Please share cryptsetup benchmark output.

Reply to PhilE stan423321 28th September 2023, 2:23 pm Debugging support is useless until the day you need it [% Is it compatible with Pico probes? Does it have hardware “intrusion” support, or is it handled by software? Reply to stan423321 Logan H-D 28th September 2023, 2:24 pm So long as it remains compatible with the Pi probe, it’ll be a handy addition for any time I manage to completely break many things.

Reply to pawel Giovanni Rito Russo 28th September 2023, 1:59 pm Will the official 7 inch Raspberry display work with Pi5? Reply to Giovanni Rito Russo Raspberry Pi Staff Alasdair Allan 28th September 2023, 2:38 pm Yes, the 7-inch Touch Display will work with the Raspberry Pi, but you’ll need a new Flat Flexible Cable (FFC) as the MIPI DSI/CSI connectors on the 5 are now at a higher density. Reply to Alasdair Allan Laszlo Dobrovolszki 28th September 2023, 1:59 pm Congrats on the new raspberry pi to the whole team. I was waiting for rpi5 for quite a while. And yes, my biggest dream came true with the on board on/off switch! Already pre-ordered two units… :D (pssst) Reply to Laszlo Dobrovolszki stan423321 28th September 2023, 2:05 pm Hey folks, minor question on the power supply changes. If I connect a 5V 6A barrel adapter I use for other stuff through a barrel/USB-C kludge to a RPi5, how will the experience differ from new official adapter? Is there some USB negotiation involved over amperes, or is that only for volts? Reply to stan423321 James Adams 28th September 2023, 2:50 pm You can add a line to config.txt to tell the Pi to ignore the power autodetection and just assume the supply can give 5V/5A. Reply to James Adams gz 28th September 2023, 2:06 pm Did I read that correctly? There is no SATA connector, and the maximum load on USB is actually lower than Pi4. This means a couple of things. The first is that you still won’t be able to connect a standard 2.5″ SSD drive without an active USB hub in between. The second – the lack of a real SATA connector is the performance bottleneck for Pi4. Therefore an old laptop with the SATA and slower CPU will be much faster and responsive that this new Pi, no matter how much faster the CPU will be. Reply to gz James Hughes 28th September 2023, 2:26 pm USB load will be fine if you use our power supply, and we will release an M.2 HAT so you can have a nice fast SSD attached, although I have found the doubling of speed of the SD card interface to make for a very good desktop performance. Reply to James Hughes fanoush 28th September 2023, 4:48 pm SATA is old, NVME/PCI-E is better for the future. Even the 1x line gives NVME speed similar to SATA, definitely not bottleneck. Well, I secretly hoped at least for two pci-e lines as every nvme ssd has at least two or have at least 3.0 version but one can’t have everything, still PI5 os great :-) I hope at least CM5 will have more pci-e lines exposed. Reply to fanoush fanoush 30th September 2023, 9:46 pm Oh, found out the pci-e line is actually 3.0 unofficially and works just fine in 3.0 mode for nvme so I am happy. ~900MB/s disk i/o is plenty. Reply to fanoush Joseph Pierce 28th September 2023, 2:11 pm That sounds nice but I can get a full blown prodesk for cheaper and it’s faster bigger HHD and more ram Reply to Joseph Pierce James Hughes 28th September 2023, 2:24 pm Interested, please supply a link to this.

Reply to Norman Jackson Jason Jackson 28th September 2023, 11:30 pm Don’t hog them all! Spill the beans, where can I find some? Although, they won’t be nearly as power efficient as RPi. Reply to Jason Jackson Logan H-D 28th September 2023, 2:22 pm I see a lot of commentators say that the Pi5 supports USB PD. The actual blog post doesn’t mention this, is this confirmable by a Pi Foundation member? Also, how does this new power supply system work with gadget mode? Does the Pi5 even have gadget mode like the Pi4 did? Reply to Logan H-D Raspberry Pi Staff Alasdair Allan 28th September 2023, 2:27 pm The Raspberry Pi 5 requires a good quality USB-C power supply capable of delivering 3A at +5V (15W) in order to boot. However, using such a supply will restrict the current draw to peripherals. If you are using a power supply that cannot provide 5A at +5V on first boot you will be warned by the operating system that the current draw to peripherals will be restricted to 600mA. The Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) of the Raspberry Pi 5 implements the USB-PD standard which allows higher voltages and currents to be negotiated via software. For users who wish to drive high-power peripherals like hard drives and SSDs, while retaining margin for peak workloads, a USB-PD enabled power supply capable of supplying a 5A at +5V (25W) should be used. If the Raspberry Pi 5 firmware detects such a supply, it increases the USB current limit for peripherals to 1.6A, providing 5W of extra power for downstream USB devices, and 5W of extra onboard power budget. Reply to Alasdair Allan Logan H-D 28th September 2023, 2:51 pm The phrasing in this seems a bit odd, would like some clarification. If I have a USB-PD power supply that can supply 12V at 3 amps, am I correct in interpreting that the Pi will *not* increase the downstream wattage? I can understand recommending 5V 5A specifically, that way there wouldn’t be a need to buck the power, but are other voltages just not going to be supported for proper supplying for other devices at full power? Reply to Logan H-D Raspberry Pi Staff Alasdair Allan 28th September 2023, 3:01 pm Our upcoming 27W USB-PD capable supply can deliver: 5.0A at 5.1V, 3.0A at 9.0V, 2.25A at 12.0V, 1.8A at15.0V. It comes with a 1.2m 17AWG captive cable. However, you are correct. If you have a power supply that can do 3A at 12V, there will be no increase in downstream Wattage. The Raspberry Pi 5 requires a 5V supply. It will negotiate for 5V at 5A. Reply to Alasdair Allan Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 3:04 pm Mine’s busy charging my M2 MacBook Pro at the moment. Seems to be handling it quite nicely. Leah 29th September 2023, 12:41 am Wow, that’s a huge disappointment. I really did not expect that. I would’ve expected it to be USB PD compliant so that you can just use any regular old power brick. Being forced to use the official Raspberry Pi wall wart is a huge dealbreaker, in my opinion. I guess I’ll just have to wait for the rev2 which fixes this – just like the USB-C issues with the Pi 4. James Hughes 28th September 2023, 2:29 pm Yes, the Pi5 will negotiate for a 5v5A supply, and use that if present (the Official PS will do this as well as other voltages). In the absence of the negotiation,. 5v3A will be used, which is actually good enough for most use cases. Reply to James Hughes Raspberry Pi Staff Liz Upton 28th September 2023, 2:30 pm Yes, the Pi 5 has gadget mode, just like Pi 4. Reply to Liz Upton thagrol 28th September 2023, 2:25 pm I’d like to have seen more power for USB devices rather than less but otherwise it sounds like a great leap forward. Reply to thagrol James Adams 28th September 2023, 2:27 pm You do get more downstream USB current, 1.6A minimum (if you have a 5V/5A supply). Reply to James Adams Nicko 28th September 2023, 2:27 pm Does the fact that the drivers for the VideoCore VII GPU will be open sourced mean that Broadcom will be publishing full details of how to make the most of the GPU? It would be great to be able to write drivers for off-loading of compute-intensive machine learning inference using the GPU, especially now we have two camera interfaces!

Reply to Mike Redrobe James Adams 28th September 2023, 2:47 pm Yes Reply to James Adams Alex 28th September 2023, 2:43 pm Does the new Pi support the standard OpenGL api (non ES)? Anyway, the faster I/O chip, the SOC and the PCIe lanes exposed are very great additions to the ecosystem. I expected a hexacore or an octacore tho Reply to Alex Jim 28th September 2023, 2:43 pm Squeee!!!!! The addition of the M.2 HAT is killing me!

Now an on topic question, will 32bit support be dropped from Raspberry Pi Bookworm OS for the RPi5 ? because it is about time that 64bit is the norm.. Reply to MW Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 5:10 pm If you’re asking whether the 32-bit Bookworm images will also support Pi 5 then the answer is no. If you’re asking something else then you’ll have to clarify the question. Reply to PhilE MW 28th September 2023, 6:34 pm Thank you, yes you have deduced correctly, great..

Reply to Joe Thompson Brad Davis. 28th September 2023, 3:24 pm Quite jovial, but I will still use my Pi 4 for the moment as I have no need for a new one anytime soon. Reply to Brad Davis. Jeff Berntsen 28th September 2023, 3:32 pm A couple of questions about the new power management system: First, is there a connector or solder pads for an external power button? I could see that being useful for third-party cases. Second, will it support wake-on-lan via Ethernet? Reply to Jeff Berntsen Raspberry Pi Staff PhilE 28th September 2023, 5:15 pm Yes – there are two through-holes next to the power connector and RTC battery connector. For wake-on-LAN I think the answer is probably no – the hardware doesn’t make it easy, and we probably won’t get around to fudging it using RP1 software. Reply to PhilE solar3000 28th September 2023, 3:36 pm excellent of course, we’ll have to fight our way thru the horde of geeks to get one. what will I do with the 300 pis I already have….

Reply to PhilE Lorenzo 28th September 2023, 4:29 pm I’m very happy to see the RPI5… and I’ve already preordered mine. However, I’m also a bit disappointed: This is what I was expecting and I didn’t get: – USB-C instead of the horrible microHDMI (or rather a single full size HDMI) – At least one USB-C 3.0 port – At least one Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector – Color-coded 40-pin header – An RP2040 MCU included in the SoC What I’m curious to see in action: – The cryptography extensions of the A76 MPU – The PIO capabilities of the RP1 I/O controller Reply to Lorenzo Taylor 28th September 2023, 6:33 pm Genuine question, but why would the Pi need another Pi(co) on board? It already has 40 pins of GPIO like the Pico (yes, for any pedants I am aware 2040 =/= Pico) Reply to Taylor Joshka 29th September 2023, 12:43 am PIO basically adds extra protocols that aren’t already there. E.g. the Pi has 6 UARTs (bidirectional), but 28 pins – PIO means potentially an extra 14 pins of UART (whichever direction) without having to dedicate a CPU to bit bang those extra pins (i.e. your app just writes to a memory address). Same thing applies for I2C / SPI / whatever protocol you want more of. PIO is a game changer! Reply to Joshka Lorenzo 30th September 2023, 9:57 am Having a real MCU on the same SoC would incredibly expand the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi. You would then have the full power of the A76 MPU for the high level OS and the raw power of the MCU for real-time tasks. This is a setup increasingly seen on industry-level SoC and having it on a RPi would have been incredible. Reply to Lorenzo Eduard 28th September 2023, 6:33 pm I totally agree.

Probably expensive though. – An RP2040 MCU included in the SoC / The PIO capabilities of the RP1 I/O controller Isn’t this kind of the RP1’s PIO stuff you mention you’re excited about? If not, hat! – The cryptography extensions of the A76 MPU This! So much this! I’m super excited to try it on the Pi 5, and another reason I’m really hoping that CM5 will finally give us an ATX-friendly ARM64 board I can stick in all my PC and Server boxes. Fast LUKS encryption will make desktop use viable for me, as well as significantly improve TLS performance when hosting services on Pi. Super excited for the Pi 5 to drop so I can get playing around with this stuff, even if it’s not in the ideal form factor for me. :) Reply to Gray Lorenzo 30th September 2023, 9:50 am > Dual monitor support > specific choice of connector! I totally disagree. Everything is better that the horrible, horrible micro-HDMI. That was by far the most common complaint of RPi4 and it’s incredible that they persisted with this really bad choice… >Again,. this is an issue of form factor. I don’t think it’s >really that big a deal, USB-A to C cables cost no more >than a good quality USB-C to C cable. It’s definitely not an issue of form factor, but of capabilities.

Micro-HDMI is trash and should NEVER be used, because it will break promptly... especially on a dinky device that moves and shifts a lot.If a full-sized HDMI port is somehow too big (which it isn&#x27;t on the regular-sized Pi, and definitely not on the 400), they should just use USB-C ports with DisplayPort capability.

Their focus is on generating contracts and fulfilling them, consumer devices are secondary.That&#x27;s to say they&#x27;ve \"forgotten what the pi is about\" insofar as they&#x27;ve made choices to grow the business&#x2F;contract side of the pi foundation more than the education and consumer availability reply ghostly_s 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s odd then that a single alternative hasn&#x27;t risen to prominence to serve their original hobbyist market.

The boards have lots more IO and some really nice real-time units. You can get the documentation from TI without an NDA.

While the RPi simply will not work with 5V@500mA, the BBB does. If you bump the frequency, your power supply needs shoot up and you start needing heat sinks.It really feels like the Beaglebone Black got the engineering aspects correct. Shame that even hackers are suceptible to marketing.At this point, being able to use the Beaglbone Black is practically a superpower for me as an engineer. I can buy it. My end customers can buy it. It&#x27;s real Linux so my end customer can bang on it as required.

Filling a market need -- well-specced hardware with long support horizons -- is perfectly fine, but Upton et al. have made it very clear that this is the priority and pretending otherwise is weird. Mass producing generic USB keyboards in corporate livery does not meaningfully communicate corporate ethics here.Meanwhile, most of the competition focuses on beating the Pi on specs, availability, or price -- and none of them seem to have noticed that long support life as being the differentiator which leads to business adoption of the Pi hardware.

But I&#x27;d really hope they&#x27;d pick the one that won&#x27;t suck up all the battery, so H264. This line of thought is supported by the fact that YouTube still provides an H264 option with most if not all videos.With higher bitrate things, HEVC seems to grow in popularity but even software decode support is not everywhere. Netflix for example requires the installation of HEVC support on Windows to play 4K content.Actually hardware-accelerated video decode is even spottier and more unreliable across most platforms. The JS API for codec support (canPlayType) literally returns \"maybe\" and \"probably\". It&#x27;s quite bad.So far the best compatibility I&#x27;ve seen has been Edge with flags on Windows (MPEG-2, H264, HEVC, AV1, VP8, VP9 with most also supporting accelerated encode). It still fails with some content (Dolby Vision P5 colors are incorrect, HEVC Rext doesn&#x27;t play - more info about HEVC is available here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;StaZhu&#x2F;enable-chromium-hevc-hardware-deco...). Chrome on macOS is a close second in terms of codec support.The worst in terms of HW acceleration being all the browsers on desktop Linux-s, few and fragile combinations that offer limited and janky support. But it&#x27;s slowly improving. This combined with the not-the-latest hardware many use, means things like VP9 or AV1 tend to stutter.I&#x27;d love to see some more generic stats, but considering the APIs aren&#x27;t sufficient to determine actual support, these might be difficult to gather.But all things considered, I heavily doubt dropping H264 HW decode support was a good idea considering how often its still used. reply Thaxll 15 hours agorootparentprevIt is the most used by far. reply overstay8930 13 hours agorootparentThe largest VOD services stopped using H.264 in any meaningful way or only as a last resort, bandwidth is just too expensive to justify using it.

    "originBody": "Artnet Artnet Auctions 中文 Log In Follow Us Art World Market Opinion Style Multimedia Artnet News Pro Buyer's Guide Opinion The World’s Most Popular Painter Sent His Followers After Me Because He Didn’t Like a Review of His Work. Here’s What I Learned The reaction from Devon Rodriguez's followers shows why developing a critical analysis of \"parasocial aesthetics\" is important. Ben Davis, October 19, 2023 Devon Rodriguez attends the 10th Annual LACMA ART+FILM GALA honoring Amy Sherald, Kehinde Wiley, and Steven Spielberg presented by Gucci at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 06, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Rich Fury/Getty Images for LACMA) A little more than a week ago, I wrote a review of an art show by the artist and TikTok sensation Devon Rodriguez, best known for live drawing subway riders. He is, by some measures, the most famous artist in the world, with many millions of social media followers. He did not like the review. It went up on a Friday. On Saturday morning, I woke up to a tidal wave of anger from Rodriguez on Instagram, tagging me across scores of posts. Hundreds of his followers went on the attack, swarming my Instagram: “loser,” “hater,” “pathetic,” “jealous,” “your a dick,” and on and on and on. There were many creative variations on “kill yourself.” Others said they were going to get me fired, or said things like, “we are going to start a cancellation campaign against you.” A large number thought that defending Rodriguez meant calling me bald, ugly, fat, or whatever they thought could get under my skin. Most didn’t seem to have actually read my article. A contingent went after my wife. “Some women will do anything for money,” one commented. That one was funny, actually. After a few days Rodriguez ceased tagging me, and the wave of hate cooled down. “@benstoppable love will always outshine being a hater, I hope I taught you that today,” Rodriguez posted. Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. Meanwhile, I also received an urgent email from UTA Artist Space: “Devon (who we represent) nor UTA was given a chance to respond to this very negative and one-sided article.” I wrote back that I had never heard of an artist demanding to comment on a review in advance, but that if Rodriguez or UTA wanted to write a reply, we would publish it. It’s not the first time that an artist has been mad at me—only the first time that an artist with this particular type of fame has gone out of his way to unleash his fans in this way. It’s also not anywhere near the worst or most important thing going on in the world, obviously. Nevertheless, I do think it raises some larger issues worth thinking about. Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. A Shifting Attention Economy In his torrent of posts, Rodriguez takes big issue with my opener: “Devon Rodriguez is almost certainly the most famous artist in the world, at least on one level,” I wrote. “Almost no one I know has ever heard of him. Except if you say: ‘he’s the painter who draws people on the subway, from TikTok.’ Then sometimes they will light up with recognition.” His response: “no one he knows has ever heard of me… as if the people that HE knows are more important than everybody else in this world that follows me.. Sorry that I’m not a part of your pretentious circle @benstoppable.” Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. But the spirit of the article is clearly, if you read it, the exact opposite of what Rodriguez seems to think it is: I’m arguing that traditional art circles should take the phenomenon seriously, and think through what is really going on with this kind of art career. Rodriguez has a lot of cultural clout—but the fact is that most people who go to museums and galleries or who regularly read about art haven’t heard of him. This is a very weird feature of the cultural present. Instead of art that gains traction over time via traditional channels and then breaks out to a wider audience, there are now regularly art phenomena that get explosively popular with an immense audience, leaving art institutions and everyone else to sort out what a particular cultural trend means after it has already happened. Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. Rodriguez is acting as if he is being unfairly scrutinized when he is one of the most influential artists out there, someone who works with A-list celebrities, who the New York Times says has made as much as $30,000 a day working with mega-brands like Cheetos, who has numerous press agents working to stage-manage his image, who is the ambassador for what contemporary art is to the largest possible audience—he even teaches a Masterclass on realistic portrait painting! “Dude has PRs putting him in the room with the president and he’s acting like you are gatekeeping him,” someone wrote me. (I should mention that I’ve received a lot of support too.) In fact, the only way I can understand Rodriguez’s incredibly thin-skinned reaction to my article is that he has managed to rise to this status of apex visibility without any kind of critical writing about him at all. It’s all just been feel-good profiles, so that the first critical word feels like a huge crisis. That’s a relatively new kind of situation for an artist to be in, and worth analyzing. Screenshot of a post by Devon Rodriguez to Instagram stories. Art Criticism and Parasocial Relationships “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all” was a phrase that commenters repeated a lot. Rodriguez’s art content makes people happy, so why be “negative?” Quite a few people posted variations on, “what is even the point of art critics?” So let me say what purpose an article like the one I wrote might serve. First: With regard to the paintings themselves, simply repeating press-release hype isn’t healthy for anyone. It happens all the time that artists get stuck doing whatever first brought them success, and dealers or marketers encourage them to just do the same thing because it’s the easiest thing to sell, thereby undermining what could be a more enduring career. As I repeat in the article, Rodriguez seems a gifted painter, in a photo-inspired realist style. At the same time, when it comes to the show I reviewed, “Underground,” the subject matter is well-trodden territory. We have 100-plus years of painters doing subway scenes, from Reginald Marsh to Jordan Casteel, so the question of what is different or exceptional about these particular versions of the theme is accented. Maybe this doesn’t matter to his audience, but it probably does matter to people who are interested in painting. Still, my question was not even this. It was whether the paintings on their own were enough to explain his extraordinary popularity. And the answer to that question is clearly no. A visitor looks at paintings in “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis. That brings me to the second point, which is where the case of Devon Rodriguez is specifically interesting. Basically, I’m arguing that we should think of his social media posts as part of his practice, to be reviewed in and of themselves. These are, after all, not just how he got famous; in some sense they are what he is really famous for. And they are in many cases clearly staged. (There is a long and robust online debate by artists about how real his subway clips are.) Take his post from October 4, where Rodriguez draws a dancer on the London Underground, who turns out to be Sabrina Bahsoon, a.k.a. “Tube Girl.” “I love your moves—are you a professional dancer?” Rodriguez asks at the climax of the clip as he hands the drawing to Bahsoon, who has three quarters of a million TikTok followers and signed with The Hive modeling agency this year. “Definitely not!” she replies, feigning surprise. What do his fans think is going on here? That Rodriguez happened to be in London, and happened to come upon another famous TikToker, and that she continued to dance in front of him for 30 minutes as he sat drawing her, with multiple cameras filming the two of them and his drawing pad, as he created a hyper-detailed portrait of Bahsoon that looks like it is sourced from a close-up photo? The comments are full of people marveling: “How did you do that? She wasn’t standing still. Absolutely incredible.” Or: “HOW DO YOU DRAW THEM WHEN THEY ARE MOVING A LOT?” Or: “Your work is amazing. I keep wondering how you keep the pencil steady on a moving train.” Great questions! Is it “mean” to point out how fake this is? If there’s no criticism of it, here’s what I think will happen: All the marketing companies and PR people looking to piggyback on Rodriguez’s popularity will stuff his feed with more and more cringe celebrity content and half-baked promo ideas until his social-media presence is bled dry of whatever charm it has. Video by UTA Artist Space telling the Devon Rodriguez story, shown in “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis. And meanwhile, a lot of fans coming across art through his channel will get a totally confused idea of how contemporary art-celebrity works. Which brings me to the last and most important answer to the question of why I think it’s worth writing about Rodriguez seriously: Because he is a role model for a ton of young artists, and they deserve an actual assessment of what is going on. “While Devon is instantly recognizable as a TikTok sensation, his story about his rise as a fine artist—from his childhood in the South Bronx to his Subway paintings and achieving Masterclass-worthy expertise—is something we are incredibly excited to share with the art world and beyond,” his agent, Arthur Lewis, wrote in the press release for “Underground.” Artists’ personal stories have long been part of how art is marketed, from Vincent van Gogh to Frida Kahlo, but in those cases, the artists’ paintings attracted interest first, and the biography became part of its legend as its fame grew. Today, personal biography and narrative are more important than ever in the gallery—most art comes equipped with some kind of story. But social media gives an added twist: Hordes of people can feel as if they have a relationship with a painter like Devon Rodriguez without ever having had any direct experience of his painting at all. Devon Rodriguez with fans at the opening of “Underground.” Photo by Ben Davis. “What if he was your son??” someone posted at me angrily. This comment is emblematic. It’s not the kind of thing one normally says about an artist getting a critical review (unless the criticism is extremely over the top and disproportionate to the status of the artist in question). Generally, the point of presenting an art show in public is to see if it can hold the attention of people who don’t directly know you. But it seems to me that the majority of Rodriguez’s fans are most engaged by his appealing social-media persona, not his actual artworks. If this is the case, then it’s logical to think that it changes how criticism is perceived. His followers feel like I am attacking a person they like, not judging artworks or analyzing a media phenomenon. I think that explains the character of the reaction, which has a level of raw personal anger completely out of joint with what I wrote in my article. Recently there’s been a lot of writing on the increasing currency of “parasocial relationships” in media, that is, the imaginary, one-sided friendships people develop with celebrities and influencers in their heads. It seems to me that Devon Rodriguez’s title as the “most popular painter in the world” shows what a powerful cultural force a “parasocial aesthetic” can be—it’s probably more powerful (or at least more accessible) than interest in paint on canvas. All the same, Devon Rodriguez’s art agents and PR handlers might gently tell him that, if one of the things you are selling is likability and good vibes, cheering on this kind of vicious reaction every time you get a review you don’t like is probably not a sustainable career path.

I might even say that it is wishful thinking. Some kind of \"long arc of history bends towards justice\" make-believe.The contrary is almost certainly true: picking fights with well-selected made up enemies is an effective way to promote a brand that is based on virtue. It transforms an inactive&#x2F;passive audience into an active participant in a movement. I would bet many of the people attacking this art critic wrote their first comment in defense of this artist. He subtly said \"I need your help\" and his audience reacted.The art critic noted the manufactured TikTok videos, obviously planned by a media savvy PR team. Perhaps he isn&#x27;t cynical enough to believe it, but this sustained and coordinated attack against him may well have been planned and orchestrated. reply wenderen 4 hours agoparent> The contrary is almost certainly true: picking fights with well-selected made up enemies is an effective way to promote a brand that is based on virtue.I concur. Anecdotally, I see lots of content from TikTok creators replying to negative comments. At first I wondered why they seemed to be only amplifying negative responses instead of their fans, and then it hit me - those were the videos that did well (i.e. those videos got the most likes, views, shares). Showcasing a \"hater comment\" turns on the video viewers&#x27; tribal instinct. We want to side with the creator, to show the hater their place. reply DoreenMichele 4 hours agoparentprevIf this is actually the first time he&#x27;s been criticized, the critic may be correct.

People there for the drama may not be paying customers. They may essentially be internet trolls.That&#x27;s the magic of the \"attention economy\" - the people that get emotionally invested in the dramas surrounding you are better than \"paying customers\", because they check their brains out and switch to ingroup&#x2F;outgroup mode - at which point you can sell them absolutely anything whatsoever. In contrast, paying customers are just annoying - they have opinions, and aren&#x27;t going to give your person the time and sustained attention - the kind of following that both you and the platform you&#x27;re on can effectively monetize through friction (i.e. continued ad exposure).Right now this seems to be the generic recipe for printing money on social media:1. Become an influencer and work at it until existing influencers treat you as one of their own;2. Start engaging in the semi-regular, petty, totally not scripted fights with your fellow influencers;3. Sign a deal for putting your name on some random bullshit commodity product, like idk. eyeliners or perfumes or makeup kits, and watch money roll in.4. Optional: bonus points if you can turn that deal info a story of two influencers having a falling out over who gets paid for the bullshit product from point 3. You can milk that kind of thing for years, all the while selling your audience the same or different flavor of bullshit with your name on it. reply gilleain 1 hour agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s what the critic suggests, yes:> In fact, the only way I can understand Rodriguez’s incredibly thin-skinned reaction to my article is that he has managed to rise to this status of apex visibility without any kind of critical writing about him at all.edit: oops I see in your other comment you quoted that part!What&#x27;s more amazing to me is that the artist doesn&#x27;t even seem to understand what a critic _does_ - like what is the critic doing?

He not only posted a snarky \"review\" of blog from whence the review sprang but his followers jumped in, castigating the reviewer in various online forums.While I never expected corners of the internet to be a revival of Enlightenment-era salons, I&#x27;d hoped that they wouldn&#x27;t be virtual pile ons.

One day he brought in a film to our C&C class that was so poorly white balanced I couldn&#x27;t not say something.

It’s a missed opportunity for Rodriguez though when he could have played his “stay humble my dude” card while… being actually humble. Is he a thug or not? Pick a lane.The problem with existence as performance art is that we will never know if Rodriguez’ lashing out was genuine, or just another part of his rags-to-riches outsider story. At this level, his posts could just as well be coming from his PR team as from him at which point the furore and performance is definitely taking over from anything this guy does with a pencil. Is Rodriguez’ level of naivety and lack of self reflection evidence of this being his genuine self, or of his PR team’s perfectly formed ideal of how the Rodriguez phenomenon ought to be projecting itself? reply DoreenMichele 5 hours agoprevThis is a really nice piece and very thoughtful and professional. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised as things with titles of this sort are much more typically someone playing the victim card under circumstances where it&#x27;s not possible to sort out who is \"the guilty party\" and who is \"the real victim.\"I actually clicked into it expecting to feel like \"Why is this on the front page of HN?\" and I don&#x27;t feel that way at all.In fact, the only way I can understand Rodriguez’s incredibly thin-skinned reaction to my article is that he has managed to rise to this status of apex visibility without any kind of critical writing about him at all. It’s all just been feel-good profiles, so that the first critical word feels like a huge crisis. That’s a relatively new kind of situation for an artist to be in, and worth analyzing.In addition to this, he more or less makes the point that Rodriquez is so famous because he cultivates a personal relationship to his audience or a \"faux personal\" -- a parasocial one -- and his fans are more invested in that than in his art per se. This is the opposite of how it usually goes in traditional art circles. Usually, the art comes first and then people become interested in the artist.It&#x27;s interesting to me because I&#x27;ve spent a lot of years trying to sort out how to have a \"relationship to the public\" -- a constructive one, a professional one. Women on the internet tend to attract a lot of drama and I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time trying to sort things out in a way that makes sense to me so I can try to get that down to a dull roar and I have found it helpful to see male-coded behavior as being about being raised to have \"a real career,\" which boils down to a professional relationship to the public, to people who are not family and friends, and female-coded behavior as about personal relationships.How do you make that professional versus personal distinction that this article touches on? How do you get people interested in your work instead of interested in some faux \"personal\" relationship to a woman they really don&#x27;t know well but want to imagine they do for reasons I have trouble grasping?And so this piece parallels some of my observations about gender issues. I think women get raised to have personal relationships and don&#x27;t get raised to have professional lives and when we go online, we talk and behave in a way that is very personal. Other people hunger for that, want more of it, actively encourage women to do more of that and no one tells us \"Honey, that&#x27;s unprofessional\" and if they do we tend to feel like \"You&#x27;re just a sexist pig trying to gatekeep me out!\" and not like \"Oh. I didn&#x27;t realize doing X was a problem.\"So it&#x27;s interesting to me to see this piece and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. I really expected this to be another internet \"he said&#x2F;she said\" kind of thing and I&#x27;m blown away that it&#x27;s not that at all and we need more of this type of analysis of how and why things sometimes go sideways on the internet. It&#x27;s our only hope of having fewer such incidents. reply whatshisface 5 hours agoparentPersonal-professional relationships are stronger than professional images, especially as it becomes less and less possible to get a job without a well-placed reference from a friend who is willing to go to bat for you. Although companies in the tech industry make more effort to have \"meritocratic\" (in fact random, there&#x27;s nothing meritocratic about trying to guess someone&#x27;s project management ability using eight hours of talking to people they&#x27;ve never met before, spread out over days) I see this being eroded over time as everyone pulls together in our low-interest-rate where&#x27;s-the-recession, it&#x27;s-coming-any-day-now environment. Although hiring managers might disagree on whose friends among them should be hired, they will all silently agree that the hiring system needs to only hire friends of somebody. That&#x27;s what drives the evolution of corporate process in an inexorable slide towards the equilibrium most industries have already reached, one where consultants are brought in to cover the holes left by bringing in old friends.I think the interchangeable parts era of tech work is nearly over and we&#x27;re heading into something that will look more like highly paid roles in other industries. This could do a lot for gender equality[0], or maybe destroy it[1].[0] Discrimination can work its way into randomized panel type scenarios because biases tend to show up in averages of first impressions more than they do in long-term relationships. That&#x27;s why they use an \"implicit bias test\" that involves flashing pictures at you, and why the \"I have female friends,\" argument is not taken seriously by anybody. What psychologists are telling us is that discrimination is maximized in the snap judgement scenarios posed by modern hiring processes.[1] A network of long-term professional relationships that can&#x27;t be unseated by anyone that isn&#x27;t taken on as an apprentice literally describes the patriarchy. reply DoreenMichele 5 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no clear, bright line between personal and professional and that makes it hard to escape the quagmire.It&#x27;s a mental model I&#x27;ve found more helpful than just screaming about \"sexism!\" but I have no expectation it will ever catch on. reply whatshisface 5 hours agorootparentI do think there&#x27;s a bright line, but it&#x27;s between trying to express yourself while negotiating reasonable emotional common ground (personal) and constantly trying to prove yourself while expanding your \"turf\" of opinions and beliefs as far as possible (professional), which is then confused in context when people operate in one mode in an environment that really fits the other. The complementary mode swap to the one you are talking about, are the crowd who argue non-stop in the Twitter replies of people who were just having a thought and not actually planning to become a Socratic philosopher. That is the consequence of treating every interaction like it&#x27;s a task-focused meeting with implied rewards for whoever comes out looking like they were on the top of it. reply DoreenMichele 5 hours agorootparentTrust is earned. Professional reputation where people trust you in certain respects is attached to you as an individual.So for me it&#x27;s been hard to say \"This is personal and that is professional.\" Like either I&#x27;m trustworthy or not.

Essentially SO2 particles stay in the air for a long time and reflects a large spectrum of light so it fails to be absorbed by land or sea&#x2F;converted to infrared (infrared is primarily what the CO2 reflects).Recently (since 2010ish but moreso since 2020 in shipping) there has been a global effort to reduce SO2 emissions (eg by installing scrubbers) which has caused the CO2 increase over the last 150 years to actually \"take effect\" since the SO2 is no longer negating the effects.I stumbled upon this theory recently and it sounds compelling but am curious if better informed people could shine a light about this.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hankgreen&#x2F;status&#x2F;1687535525169930241https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;LeonSimons8&#x2F;status&#x2F;1688145475289931776https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weforum.org&#x2F;agenda&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;sea-surface-temperatu... reply BillFranklin 16 hours agoparentYeah it&#x27;s mentioned in Stephen Hawking&#x27;s last book: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stratospheric_aerosol_inject...“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that it is the most-researched solar geoengineering method, with high agreement that it could limit warming to below 1.5 °C”There’s a risk it’d affect the ozone layer. But Paul Crutzen, who won the Nobel Prize for his ozone research in 95, said the sulfur plan is “the only option available to rapidly reduce temp rises and counteract other climactic effects”.We’d also need to add shockingly little SO2 to the stratosphere. We currently emit 200m tons per year (25% is humans, rest is volcanos and other natural sources). We’d need to add an extra 100k per year.Edit: I think one of the Microsoft co-founders was looking into it, the problems of proving it would work were political - not engineering-related. reply aoeusnth1 15 hours agorootparent100k or 100M?200M + 100k = 200.1M, and I doubt the 200M figure had 4 significant figures. reply mercurywells 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;d be a smaller amount that gets injected into the stratosphere, as opposed to what we normally release into the troposphere. A quick skim of the wikipedia link seems to suggest 5M tons in total, not sure what the annualized basis would be. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentprevIt always strikes me as odd that the geoengineering experiment that got us into the predicament (dumping boatloads of CO2 into the atmosphere), the politics were so much easier. reply trescenzi 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve generally come to the belief that it&#x27;s related to how humans think about cause and effect.Dumping boatloads of CO2 into the atmosphere is second order from the actual goal of producing electricity so most people just can&#x27;t&#x2F;don&#x27;t&#x2F;won&#x27;t think about it.In this case we&#x27;d be intentionally dumping SO2 so people are capable of thinking \"wow that&#x27;s not moral\" or whatever issue they might have with it. reply dingnuts 15 hours agorootparentI think the biggest concern with something like releasing SO2 as a geoengineering project, which needs, quoting someone else in the thread \"very little\" to be released to have a big effect, the concern is over-correction or unforeseen effects caused by an insufficient understanding of the system as a whole.Don&#x27;t want to accidentally start an ice age by trying to prevent a hothouse planet from forming :P reply lamontcg 15 hours agorootparentAnd we want to stop releasing CO2.

To hit the cooling target, this project would need 125 purpose-built SAIL-43Ks, flying a total of 1,458 missions per day during the four-month injection period at each pole. These planes would take off, climb for 30 minutes, vent their entire load of sulfur dioxide within two minutes, then come back down over the following 30 minutes, and spend the next hour loading up again and refueling for the next mission.> All sulfur oxides are nasty to breathe in, harming the lungs and causing asthma and bronchitis if inhaled regularly... It notes that the effects of teragrams of sulfur dioxide and the associated acid rain deposits are risky both to humans and to the wider ecosystem, requiring lots more research.

No reason to lift entire plane into the air. The launch stations can be placed in relatively remote locationst to minimize human or natural habitat impact. Possibly place launch locaitons close to So2 mining location to limit transport Co2. reply brucethemoose2 14 hours agorootparentThe original paper says:> For the sort of globally effective SAI deployment in the tropics and sub-tropics envisioned in (Smith and Wagner 2018) and (Smith 2020), a deployment altitude of 20 km is commonly assumed in order to remain well above the tropopause, which can often appear as high as 17 km in the tropics. Injection of large masses of aerosols at 20 km is not judged to be feasible with existing aircraft, requiring the development of new lofting platforms designed for this mission as envisionedGround deployment is not extensively discussed, but perhaps the referenced papers discuss the necessity of high altitude more. reply SketchySeaBeast 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat does a \"launch\" location for SO2 look like from the ground? Is there any guarantee it would get as high as we&#x27;d like, especially given that SO2 is heavier than air? reply mmanfrin 15 hours agorootparentprevI feel if we get to the point where we have to do that, humanity will just give up. reply blooalien 14 hours agorootparentKinda feels like entirely too large a percentage of humanity already gave up entirely too long ago, and now it&#x27;s rather too late for many of &#x27;em to change their minds. Isn&#x27;t that why we&#x27;d rather let our \"leaders\" geoengineer some more screw-ups upon our environment rather than actively work toward the changes we know will actually improve the situation? (eg; \"fast track\" our societal transitions globally toward more \"planet-friendly\" everything that we can? Just all-around \"cleaner\" modes of living? Better for the planet, and for humanity.) reply brucethemoose2 12 hours agorootparentprevThe effective window for this to stave off bad effects is very short....A decade before starting, maybe?Thats the problem with climate change. The tipping points are so disconnected from the collective pain thresholds. reply gumby 15 hours agoparentprevYes, this has been studied quite a bit (but not \"extensively\"). I am (guardedly) a fan of managing the earth&#x27;s albedo, but not on a global scale and especially not with a toxic compound like SO2. Some of the most important issues:* It&#x27;s not just SO2, but soot and other particulates that reflect sunlight, in particular IR.* SO2 (and soot etc, for that matter) have other side effects; its not that they were eliminated for no reason. And the point of any ecological activity (not just climate intervention) is to make the environment more supportive to human life and ativity. Stratospheric SO2 advocates tend to dismiss these issues.* solar radiation adjustment has other consequences (on agriculture, for example). In the case of SO2 the frequencies reflected by SO2 are not all ones we want to do without -- we need some UV to get through.* Stratospheric SO2 injection (AKA \"SAI\") is hard to switch off, so if we are unhappy with the results (widespread reduction in agriculture, if that&#x27;s what happens) we would be waiting years, possibly decades, to get things back on track.Solar radiation can also be managed at a more local level in the troposphere through marine cloud brightening for example, and can be done with more benign chemicals than SO2 (e.g. water), and can be switched on and off quite rapidly (days). It will use more energy and activity, but also provide greater control (in some locations on the water you may not want increased shade because of microscopic marine life).Note I am working on removal of ambient greenhouse gas (CH4) and so am quite sensitive to the safety and consequences of intervention. reply vondur 13 hours agorootparentI wonder if there&#x27;s a way to keep the SO2 localized to a geographic area? The best bang for the buck should be over the arctic to help with the ice loss and less reflectivity due to that. reply gumby 12 hours agorootparentI talked about localized marine cloud brightening, but why would you choose something toxic like SO2? There’s a reason why the first emissions trading market was one that controlled SO2 emissions: acid rain.In the case of the arctic there are non-atmospheric (i.e. surface) interventions being investigated as well to change the local albedo.

I think the main limit would be the materials to construct enough carbon capture facilities to do the job.One nice thing about carbon capture is it doesn&#x27;t matter much where you do it. The atmosphere does a great job of spreading CO2 nearly uniformly. You just need places with sufficient available energy and somewhere to put the carbon.One possibility would be subtropical deserts. They have plenty of sunlight for energy and plenty of land that could be used without displacing many people.Imagine carbon capture facilities that consist of a solar farm for power with the panels mounted a few meters off the ground, and we dump the captured carbon under the panels.As calculated earlier, 1 gigaton of captured CO2 would give enough carbon to cover Texas to a depth of 0.017 cm. There are about 3000 gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere, so if we captured all of it, that would cover Texas to a depth of 51 cm.The 5 largest subtropical deserts have a combined area 22 times as big as Texas. If we covered just 10% of that area in solar farms to power carbon capture with a meter of room under the solar panels we&#x27;d have plenty of storage space.At the efficiency of current solar farms and current carbon capture, they would be capturing about 10% more carbon per year than we are currently emitting. Cover 90% of those 5 deserts with such plants and in under a decade we could get back to preindustrial CO2 levels.The big limit that I see on doing this is production of solar panels. At current production rates, covering 10% of the 5 largest subtropical deserts would use about 180 years worth of solar panels.I have no idea if there are enough raw materials available to let us to increase that enough to make it worth considering. reply onlyrealcuzzo 12 hours agorootparent> The big limit that I see on doing this is production of solar panels.

The trick is to sink it in just the right way to keep it from reentering the carbon cycle.We actually do have a lot of space that&#x27;s already capturing far more carbon than we ever possibly could ourselves, the organisms filling that space just evolved to maximize survival, not maximize carbon capture to save humanity.* Edit: actually that&#x27;s just cold climate peatlands, I haven&#x27;t seen estimates for tropical peatlands reply the_sleaze9 15 hours agorootparentprevImagine all the corn that gets subsidized in the United States. reply reactordev 15 hours agorootparentprevWe’ll just bury it like we do with our heads. reply foobarbecue 16 hours agoparentprevYes.

These fluctuations get smoothed out with time and distance through turbulent mixing and wind shear.

It is not a greenhouse gas. reply philipkglass 12 hours agorootparentGPT is not a reliable source. Note that 4 out of 6 of these \"molecules with three atoms\" it offers do not have three atoms. (Carbon monoxide and nitric oxide have two; iodine trichloride and hydrogen peroxide have 4.)The GP&#x27;s somewhat cryptic statement about 3 atoms is explained better here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climatescienceteaching.org&#x2F;lesson&#x2F;infrared-spectrosc...Monatomic gases and diatomic molecules made of identical atoms (e.g. O2, N2) are not \"active\" with regard to infrared radiation. They are transparent to it. Almost all other molecules are \"IR active,\" meaning that they can absorb IR radiation in ways that are characteristic of their vibrational modes. This includes the well known greenhouse gases carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Greenhouse gases are those IR active molecules that have a significant residence time in the atmosphere and can thus partially trap IR radiation emitted from the Earth&#x27;s surface.Some substances are IR active but are not usually classified as greenhouse gases because they quickly break down in the environment. Other substances are IR active but not counted among greenhouse gases because they have a low vapor pressure and do not significantly make it into the atmosphere. reply it 7 hours agorootparentFair enough, so 4 of them are not molecules with three atoms.However, that leaves two that are: ozone (O3) and NO2 Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2).

Labor or in this case kitchen experiment do not model the real wold.

    "title": "Replacing WebRTC: real-time latency with WebTransport and WebCodecs",
    "originLink": "https://quic.video/blog/replacing-webrtc/",
    "originBody": "Replacing WebRTC The long path to use something else for real-time media. tl;dr If you primarily use WebRTC for… real-time media: it will take a while to replace WebRTC; we’re working on it. data channels: WebTransport is amazing and actually works. peer-to-peer: you’re stuck with WebRTC for the forseeable future. Disclaimer I spent almost two years building/optimizing a partial WebRTC stack @ Twitch using pion. Our use-case was quite custom and we ultimately scrapped it, but your millage may vary. Why WebRTC? Google released WebRTC in 2011 as a way of fixing a very specific problem: How do we build Google Meet? Back then, the web was a very different place. Flash was the only way to do live media and it was a mess. HTML5 video was primarily for pre-recorded content. It personally took me until 2015 to write a HTML5 player for Twitch using MSE, and we’re still talking 5+ seconds of latency on a good day. Transmitting video over the internet in real-time is hard. You need a tight coupling between the video encoding and the network to avoid any form of queuing, which adds latency. This effectively rules out TCP and forces you to use UDP. But now you also need a video encoder/decoder that can deal with packet loss without spewing artifacts everywhere. Source. Example of Artifacts caused by packet loss. Google (correctly) determined that it would be impossible to solve these problems piecewise with new web standards. The approach instead was to create libwebrtc, the defacto WebRTC implementation that still ships with all browsers. It does everything, from networking to video encoding/decoding to data transfer, and it does it remarkably well. It’s actually quite a feat of software engineering, especially the part where Google managed to convince Apple/Mozilla to embed a full media/networking stack into their browsers. My favorite part about WebRTC is that it manages to leverage existing standards. WebRTC is not really a protocol, but rather a collection of protocols: ICE, STUN, TURN, DTLS, RTP/RTCP, SRTP, SCTP, SDP, mDNS, etc. Throw a Javascript API on top of these and you have WebRTC. Source. That’s a lot of protocols layered on top of each other. Why not WebRTC? I wouldn’t be writing this blog post if WebRTC was perfect. The core issue is that WebRTC is not a protocol; it’s a monolith. WebRTC does a lot of things, let’s break down it down piece by piece: Media: a full capture/encoding/networking/rendering pipeline. Data: reliable/unreliable messages. P2P: peer-to-peer connectability. SFU: a relay that selectively forwards media. Media The WebRTC media stack is designed for conferencing and does an amazing job at it. The problems start when you try to use it for anything else. My final project at Twitch was to reduce latency by replacing HLS with WebRTC for delivery. This seems like a no-brainer at first, but it quickly turned into death by a thousand cuts. The biggest issue was that the user experience was just terrible. Twitch doesn’t need the same aggressive latency as Google Meet, but WebRTC is hard-coded to compromise on quality. In general, it’s quite difficult to customize WebRTC outside of a few configurable modes. It’s a black box that you turn on, and if it works it works. And if it doesn’t work, then you have to deal with the pain that is forking libwebrtc… or just hope Google fixes it for you. The protocol has some wiggle room and I really enjoyed my time tinkering with pion. But you’re ultimately bound by the browser implementation, unless you don’t need web support, in which case you don’t need WebRTC. Data WebRTC also has a data channel API, which is particularly useful because until recently, it’s been the only way to send/receive “unreliable” messages from a browser. In fact, many companies use WebRTC data channels to avoid the WebRTC media stack (ex. Zoom). I went down this path too, attempting to send each video frame as an unreliable message, but it didn’t work due to fundamental flaws with SCTP. I won’t go into the detail in this post, but I eventually hacked “datagram” support into SCTP by breaking frames into unreliable messages below the MTU size. Finally! UDP* in the browser, but at what cost: a convoluted handshake that takes at least 10 (!) round trips. 2x the packets, because libsctp immediately ACKs every “datagram”. a custom SCTP implementation, which means the browser can’t send “datagrams”. Oof. P2P The best and worst part about WebRTC is that it supports peer-to-peer. The ICE handshake is extremely complicated, even from the application’s point of view. Without going into detail, there’s an explosion of permutations that you need to handle based on the network topology. Some networks block P2P (ex. symmetric NATs) while others outright block UDP, forcing you to use a TURN server a non-insignificant amount of time. Most conferencing solutions are client-server anyway, relying on their own private network instead of public transit (aka a CDN). However the server is still forced to perform the complicated ICE handshake which has major architecture ramifications, but I’ll save that for another blog post. Note that there are rumblings of P2P WebTransport and P2P QUIC, but I wouldn’t hold my breath. SFU Last but not least, WebRTC scales using SFUs (Selective Forwarding Units). Source. Participants send to a central server, rather than directly to each other. The problem with SFUs is subtle: they’re custom. It requires a lot of business logic to determine where to forward packets. A single server like that diagram won’t scale, nor will all of the participants be located in the same geo. Each SFU needs to be made aware of the network topology and the location of each participant somehow. Additionally, a good SFU will avoid dropping packets based on dependencies, otherwise you waste bandwidth on undecodable packets. Unfortunately, determining this requires parsing each RTP packet on a per-codec basis. For example, here’s a h.264 depacketizer for libwebrtc. But the biggest issue at Twitch was that SFUs share very little in common with CDNs. One team is optimizing WebRTC, another team is optimizing HTTP, and they’re not talking to each other. This is why HLS/DASH uses HTTP instead: economies of scale Replacing WebRTC Okay enough ranting about what’s wrong, let’s fix it. First off, WebRTC is not going anywhere. It does a fantastic job at what it was designed for: conferencing. It will take a long time before anything will reach feature/latency parity with WebRTC. Before you can replace WebRTC, you need WebSupport. Fortunately, we now have WebCodecs and WebTransport. WebCodecs WebCodecs is a new API for encoding/decoding media in the browser. It’s remarkably simple: Capture input via canvas or a media device. VideoEncoder: Input raw frames, output encoded frames. Transfer those frames somehow. (ex. WebTransport) VideoDecoder: Input encoded frames, output raw frames. Render output via canvas or just marvel at the pixel data. The catch is that the application is responsible for all timing. That means you need to choose when to render each frame via requestAnimationFrame. In fact, you need to choose when to render each audio sample via AudioWorklet. The upside is that now your web application gets full control of how to render media. It’s now possible to implement WebRTC-like behavior, like temporarily freezing video and desyncing A/V. Check caniuse for current browser support. WebTransport WebTransport is a new API for transmitting data over the network. Think of it like WebSockets, but with a few key differences: QUIC not TCP. Reliable streams that are delivered in order. Semi-reliable streams by closing a stream (with an error code) to drop the tail. Unreliable datagrams that may be dropped during congestion. QUIC has too many benefits to enumerate, but some highlights: Fully encrypted Congestion controlled (even datagrams) Independent streams (no head-of-line blocking) 1-RTT handshake Multiplexed over a single UDP port Transparent network migration (ex. switching from Wifi to LTE) Used for HTTP/3 That last one is surprisingly important: WebTransport will share all of the optimizations that HTTP/3 receives. A HTTP/3 server can simultaneously serve multiple WebTransport sessions and HTTP requests over the same connection. Check caniuse for current browser support. Use my Rust library for servers and native clients! But how? Okay, so we have WebCodecs and WebTransport, but are they actually useful? I alluded to the secret behind latency earlier: avoiding queues. Queuing can occur at any point in the media pipeline. Capture/Encode Send/Receive Decode/Render —> —> —> Let’s start with the easy one. WebCodecs allows you to avoid queuing almost entirely. Capture/Encode Send/Receive Decode/Render WebCodecs ? WebCodecs The tricky part is the bit in the middle, the network. It’s not as simple as throwing your hands into the air and proclaiming “UDP has no queues!” The Internet of Queues The internet is a series of tubes. You put packets in one end and they eventually come out of the other end, kinda. This section will get an entire blog post in the future, but until then, let’s over-simplify things. Every packet you send will fight with other packets on the internet. If routers have sufficient throughput, packets arrive on time. If routers have limited throughput, packets will be queued. If those queues are full, packets will be dropped. There can be random packet loss, but 99% of the time we care about loss due to queuing. Note that even datagrams may be queued by the network; a firehose of packets is never the answer. Detecting Queuing The goal of congestion control is to detect queuing and back off. Different congestion control algorithms use different signals to detect queuing. This is a gross oversimplification of a topic with an immense amount of research, but here’s a rough breakdown: Signal Description Latency Examples Packet Loss Wait until the queue is full and packets are dropped. High Reno, CUBIC ACK Delay Indirectly measure the queue size via ACK RTT. Medium BBR, COPA Packet Delay Indirectly measure the queue size via packet RTT. Low GCC, SCReAM ECN Get told by the router to back off. None* L4S There’s no single “best” congestion control algorithm; it depends on your use-case, network, and target latency. But this is one area where WebRTC has an advantage thanks to transport-wide-cc. Reducing Bitrate Once you detect queuing, the application needs to send fewer bytes. In some situations we can just reduce the encoder bitrate, however: This only applies to future frames. We don’t want one viewer to degrade the experience for all. It’s too expensive to encode on a per-viewer basis. So basically, we have to drop encoded media in response to congestion. This is the fundamental problem with TCP. Once you queue data on a TCP socket, it can’t be undone without closing the connection. You can’t put the toothpaste back in the tube. Source. You earned a meme for making it this far. However, there are actually quite a few ways of dropping media with WebTransport: Use datagrams and choose which packets to transmit. (like WebRTC) Use QUIC streams and close them to stop transmissions. (like RUSH) Use QUIC streams and prioritize them. (like Warp) I’m biased because I made the 3rd one. WebTransport’s sendOrder can be used to instruct the QUIC stack what should be sent during congestion. But that deserves an entire blog post on its own. Replacing WebRTC But to actually replace WebRTC, we need a standard. Anybody can make their own UDP-based protocol (and they do), using this new web tech (and they will). What sets Media over QUIC apart is that we’re doing it through the IETF, the same organization that standardized WebRTC… and virtually every internet protocol. It’s going to take years. It’s going to take a lot of idiots like myself who want to replace WebRTC. It’s going to take a lot of companies who are willing to bet on a new standard. And there are major flaws with both WebCodecs and WebTransport that still need to be addressed before we’ll ever reach WebRTC parity. To name a few: We need better congestion control in browsers. We need something like transport-wide-cc in QUIC: like this proposal We need echo cancellation in WebAudio, which might be possible? We may need FEC in QUIC: like this proposal We may need more encoding options, like non-reference frames or SVC. Oh yeah and full browser support: WebCodecs - WebTransport So yeah… Written by @kixelated. Hit me up on Discord if you want to help!

I appreciate that making an API that can be implemented with the wide variety of decoding implementations is not an easy task.But to be specific, this is a bit problematic with I-frames only videos too, and with optimizeForLatency enabled (that does make the queue shorter). I can of course .flush() to get the frames out but this is too slow for smooth playback.I think I could just keep pushing chunks until I see the frame I want coming out but it will have to be done in an async \"busy loop\" which feels a bit nasty. But this is done also in the \"official\" examples I think.Something like \"enqueue\" event (similarly to dequeue) that more chunks after last .decode() are needed to saturate the decoder would allow for a clean implementation. Don&#x27;t know if this is possible with all backends though. reply Rodeoclash 13 hours agorootparentprevWow, great to see some work in this space. I&#x27;ve been wanting to do reverse playback, frame accurate seek and step by step forward and back rendering in the browser for esports game analysis. The regular video tag gets you somewhat of the way there but navigating frame by frame will sometimes jump an extra frame. Likewise trying to stop at an exact point will often be 1 or 2 frames off where you should be. Firefox is much worse, when pausing at a time you could +-12 frames where you should be.I must find some time to dig into this, thanks for sharing it. reply jampekka 11 hours agorootparentI have it working with WebCodecs, but currently i-frames only videos and all the decoded frames are read to memory.

For example, Oculus Link encodes 1&#x2F;n of the video in parallel encoders and decodes similarly. This way your encoding time only contributes 1&#x2F;n frame encode&#x2F;decode worth of latency because the rest is amortized with tx+decode of other slices. I suspect the biggest requirement here is to be able to cheaply and easily get N VideoFrames OR be able to cheaply split a VideoFrame into horizontal or vertical slices. reply DaleCurtis 14 hours agorootparent* Hmm, what kind of scheme are you thinking beyond per frame QP?

Of course, maybe encoders don&#x27;t actually support this? I can&#x27;t recall. It&#x27;s been a while.> Does splitting frames in WebGPU&#x2F;WebGL work for the use case here? I&#x27;m not sure we could do anything internally (we&#x27;re at the mercy of hardware decode implementations) without implementing such a shader.I don&#x27;t think you need a shader. We did it at Oculus Link with existing HW encoders and it worked fine (at least for AMD and NVidia - not 100% sure about Intel&#x27;s capabilities). It did require some bitmunging to muck with the NVidia H264 bitstream to make the parallel QCOM decoders happy with slices coming from a single encoder session* but it wasn&#x27;t that significant a problem.For video streaming, supporting a standard for Webcams to be able to deliver slices with timestampped information about the rolling shutter (+ maybe IMU for mobile use cases) would help create a market for premium low-latency webcams. You&#x27;d need to figure out how to implement just in time rolling shutter corrections on the display side to mitigate the downsides of rolling shutter but the extra IMU information would be very useful (many mobile camera display packages support this functionality). VR displays often have rolling shutter so a rolling shutter webcam + display together would really make it possible to do \"just in time\" corrections for where pixels end up to adjust for latency. I&#x27;m not sure how much you&#x27;d get out of that, but my hunch is that if you knock out all the details you should be able to shave off nearly a frame of latency glass to glass.Speaking of adjustments, extracting motion vectors from the video is also useful, at least for VR, so that you can give the compositor the relevant information to apply last-minute corrections for that \"locked to your motion\" feeling (counteracts motion sickness).On a related note, with HW GPU encoders, it would be nice to have the webcam frame sent from the webcam directly to the GPU instead of round-tripping into a CPU buffer that you then either transport to the GPU or encode on the CPU - this should save a few ms of latency. Think NVidia&#x27;s Direct standards but extended so that the GPU can grab the frame from the webcam, encode & maybe even send it out over Ethernet directly (the Ethernet part would be particularly valuable for tech like Stadia &#x2F; GeForce now). I know the HW standards for that don&#x27;t actually exist yet, but it might be interesting to explore with NVidia, AMD, and Intel what HW acceleration of that data path might look like.* NVidia&#x27;s encoder supports slices directly and has an artificial limit on the number of encoder sessions on consumer drivers (they raised it in the past few years but IIRC it&#x27;s still anemic). That however means that the generated slices have some incorrect parameters in the bitstream if you want to decode them independently. So you have to muck with the bitstream in a trivial way so that the decoders see independent valid H264 bitstreams they can decode. On AMD you don&#x27;t have a limit to the number of encoder. reply DaleCurtis 11 hours agorootparent> Ideally I&#x27;d like to be able to set the CBR &#x2F; VBR bitrateWhat&#x27;s wrong with the existing VBR&#x2F;CBR modes? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;VideoEncode...> I don&#x27;t think you need a shader...Ah I see what you mean.

The stuff easiest to standardize for WebCodecs is stuff that&#x27;s already standardized as part of the relevant codec spec (e.g, AVC, AV1, etc) and well supported on a significant range of hardware.As I said, oculus link worked with off the shelf encoders. Only the Nvidia one needed some special work and even that’s not even needed anymore since they raised the number of encoders (and the amount of work was really trivial - just adjusting some header information in the h.264 framing). I think all you really need is the ability to either slice a VideoFrame into strips 0 cost and have the user feed them into separate encoders OR to request sliced encoding and under the hood that’s implemented however (either multiple encoder sessions or using Nvidia slice API if using nvenc). You can even make support for sliced encoding optional and implement it just for the backends where it’s doable. replykixelated 16 hours agoparentprevThanks for WebCodecs!I&#x27;m still just trying to get A&#x2F;V sync working properly because WebAudio makes things annoying.

(I hope they have updated that API since I last looked). Once you know how to poke it to make it do what you want, which tends to require reading the C++ source, it&#x27;s definitely got a massive head start, especially around areas like low level hardware integration. Even bolting on ML inference and so on is not hard. The huge point though is everyone knows everyone has to talk to libwebrtc at some point, so it is the de facto implementation of SDP etc.Curiously I was working on a webrtc project for about 18 months which also hit the wall, however, since then I have learned of several high profile data only libwebrtc deployments, which really just use it in the way classic libjingle was intended to be used, P2P, NAT punching etc. I&#x27;d go so far as to say if you don&#x27;t have a P2P aspect to what you&#x27;re doing with libwebrtc you&#x27;re missing the point.The big picture though is there seems to be a general denial of the fact that web style CDNs and multidirectional media streaming graphs are two totally different beasts. reply kixelated 4 hours agorootparentYeah, if you&#x27;re using WebRTC only for data channels, then 100% you should switch to WebTransport with all due haste.

But the underlying complexity needs to be handled somewhere and there are always trade-offs between control and ease-of-use. reply englishm 13 hours agoparentprev [–] I very much disagree with the characterization of WebRTC being \"designed to be overcomplicated and garbage on purpose\" but I do think your point about needing to not open the door to DDoS botnet capabilities is something worth highlighting.There are a number of very challenging constraints placed on the design of browser APIs and this is one of them that is often grappled with when trying to expose more powerful networking capabilities.Another that&#x27;s particularly challenging to deal with in the media space is the need to avoid adding too much additional fingerprinting surface area.For each, the appropriate balance can be very difficult to strike and often requires a fair bit of creativity that can look like \"complication\" without the context of the constraints being solved for. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "opensource.google.com Events Projects Programs and services Documentation About Blog Google Open Source Blog The latest news from Google on open source releases, major projects, events, and student outreach programs. Android and RISC-V: What you need to know to be ready Monday, October 30, 2023 Android is an open source operating system that is freely available to port to many devices and architectures. As such it supports many different device types and CPU architectures. We’re excited to be adding a new one to that list - RISC-V. RISC-V is a free and open instruction set architecture (ISA), bringing the same spirit of industry-wide collaboration and innovation that we see in software around open source to the hardware ecosystem. Invented 10 years ago at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V has seen rapid adoption in embedded and microcontroller spaces, and in recent years has expanded into accelerators, servers, and mobile computing. In November of 2022, we announced at the RISC-V Summit that we were accepting patches for RISC-V: The latest update that we have is that now not only are we accepting patches, but we have begun to mature support for RISC-V in Android. RISC-V is a modular ISA, meaning that there are a large number of optional extensions. We have also determined an initial set that we feel is critical to ensure that any CPU running RISC-V will have all of the features we expect to achieve high performance. This set includes the rva22 profile as well as the vector and vector crypto extensions. This update was provided at the RISC-V summit in Europe: You can build, test, and run the Android support for RISC-V on your own machine as well now! Just like other platform targets in AOSP, you can use the Cuttlefish Virtual Device support: $ lunch aosp_cf_riscv64_phone-userdebug $ m -j $ launch_cvd -cpus=8 -memory_mb=8192 Then, you can use vncviewer to connect to the running device and interact. At this time, these patches will support building and running a basic Android Open Source Project experience, but are not yet fully optimized. For example, work on a fully optimized backend for the Android Runtime (ART) is still a work in progress. Additionally, AOSP, our external projects, and compilers haven’t generated fully optimized, reduced code that also takes advantage of the latest ratified extensions, such as the one for vectors. However, we believe that it is ready to allow experimentation and collaboration. Later this year, we expect to have the NDK ABI finalized and canary builds available on Android’s public CI soon and RISC-V on x86-64 & ARM64 available for easier testing of riscv64 Android applications on a host machine. By 2024, the plan is to have emulators available publicly, with a full feature set to test applications for various device form factors! As recently announced in our collaboration with Qualcomm, we expect wearables to be the first form factor available. However, just porting the Android operating system itself is not enough! We are working with the community and RISE (RISC-V Software Ecosystem). The RISE Project has been established to provide a way to accelerate the availability of software for high-performance and power-efficient RISC-V processor cores running high-level operating systems. That includes not only Android, but also Linux and other operating systems across a variety of application domains, including high-performance computing. The RISE Project includes members from Andes, Google, Intel, Imagination Technologies, MediaTek, Nvidia, Qualcomm Technologies, Red Hat, Rivos, Samsung, SiFive, T-Head, and Ventana. Google is also continuing and expanding our strong investments at RISC-V International, even beyond our long-standing Premium membership and board participation. We also have many other contributors in key roles on horizontal committees, working groups, and technical committees to ensure that specifications are rapidly being designed and ratified to benefit not only Android but also many other use cases. Android's support for RISC-V is dependent on a wide range of contributions from toolchain to basic support libraries. We are very appreciative of the ongoing efforts which requires countless projects to support RISC-V build configurations and quality implementations. If you are interested in contributing please visit the following resources: https://github.com/google/android-riscv64 for detailed information on how to build and test the RISC-V support in Android, list of known issues and opportunities to contribute to AOSP at source.android.com and toolchain projects and support libraries. Subscribe to RISC-V Android SIG mailing list or join directly, if your organization is a member of RISC-V International to stay tuned in to progress and offer your suggestions and feedback. Make sure to stay tuned as we look into ways to make it as easy for Android developers writing native to target new platforms as it is for our Java and Kotlin developers!

They need to make it zero work, followed by optional optimizations, like Apple did with their M1.Remember when Google told everyone to test their Android apps on x86. And then again on MIPS? And then nothing happened. Developers will not waste their time. reply ojn 7 hours agoparentZero work? I guess memory fades quickly sometimes.Apple rented out DTK systems for $500 for developers to get their hands on ARM hardware and port their applications. Hardly zero work. You couldn&#x27;t even keep the hardware, you had to send it back (and originally you wouldn&#x27;t even get $500 in credit to buy a production system with, luckily they fixed that after the easily predictable uproar).Google is providing software emulators instead, much easier to work with and doesn&#x27;t require complicated device logistics. Not only that, but the only audience that really needs to do work to get ready, are either those producing NDK applications, or those working on hardware support for RISC-V.Java&#x2F;Kotlin applications would not need any porting. Sounds like zero work to me! reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentIf you were initially fine with software emulation (i.e. Rosetta 2), as were many small and large software projects for macOS or Unix, you had no need whatsoever to get a DTK. reply makeitdouble 1 hour agorootparent> If you were initially fine with software emulation (i.e. Rosetta 2)You&#x27;d need a DTK to know if you&#x27;re fine with emulation or not.If you cared at all about your app running, you wouldn&#x27;t just assume that it magically runs fine on an emulation layer you never touched, and that at speeds that are reasonable.For a reference point, Rosetta was far from being great, and while some apps could run against it, it was most of the time an ultra painful experience. That pain helped devs to put the effort into making native versions, but it also means you couldn&#x27;t expect Rosetta 2 to give acceptable performances from Apple&#x27;s track record. reply xvector 1 hour agorootparentAre you talking about Rosetta 1 or 2? Because Rosetta 2 was not an \"ultra painful experience\" in any sense of the phrase.Rosetta 2 was straightforward and surprisingly fast, requiring zero tweaking or user interaction. Most people never even noticed. reply beebmam 4 hours agorootparentprevJava&#x2F;JVM on ARM&#x2F;M1 had an enormous amount of bugs for the first several years, fyi. Source: I encountered many of them, which eventually got fixed. reply KingOfCoders 4 hours agorootparent\"Java&#x2F;JVM\" in general or on Android? Seems to be the second b&#x2F;c I heavily used Java in the 90s and didn&#x27;t encounter JVM bugs. reply heavyset_go 4 hours agorootparentAndroid doesn&#x27;t use the JVM. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentIt actually does, the devices might run ART, however the whole developer toolchain depends heavily on the JVM, Gradle, Android Studio&#x2F;InteliJ, the pleothoara of little CLI tools to transform those .class files into .dex, desugar modern JVM bytecodes into JVM bytecodes that can actually be mapped into existing .dex ones (for pre-Android 12 devices), library calls that need to be polyfilled into something else,.... reply KingOfCoders 2 hours agorootparentprevThanks, didn&#x27;t know. reply fweimer 2 hours agorootparentprevGNU&#x2F;Linux applications are typically quite portable across CPUs. Is Android really that different? I would expect that once you have ported it an NDK application to at least two architectures, the third one should be really easy. And with Android, you already get two easily testable architecture (the ubiquitous aarch64, and x86-64 under virtualization).(It&#x27;s not that many Debian or Fedora community contributors have a mainframe in their basement—yet the software they package tends to build and run on s390x just fine. Okay, maybe there are some endianess issues, but you wouldn&#x27;t hit those with RISC-V.) reply charcircuit 1 hour agorootparentAssuming you have the source code for all your native code, then yes it should mostly work. 3rd party libraries can contain native code which means that you may be dependent on someone else porting their code. reply kllrnohj 6 hours agoparentprev> Remember when Google told everyone to test their Android apps on x86. And then again on MIPS? And then nothing happened. Developers will not waste their time.x86 builds of Android apps & libraries are extremely common to have since it&#x27;s the most common target for emulators.As for MIPS, I don&#x27;t think Google ever pushed it. It was just kinda there.Also also, this blog post is aimed at device manufacturers more than app developers which is why it talks about building AOSP & pending patches. It&#x27;s not asking app devs to do anything (in fact it even says at the bottom \"Make sure to stay tuned as we look into ways to make it as easy for Android developers writing native to target new platforms as it is for our Java and Kotlin developers!\") reply roneythomas6 5 hours agoparentprevMIPS died for Android after Imagination Technologies acquired it in 2013. There is nothing for Google to do when there is no new SOC or new phones. As for x86, it is still widely used thanks to Chromebooks. Unless you use NDK there is nothing on your end to do for new targets. reply kimixa 4 hours agorootparentMIPS died for android well before that - they only had microcontroller-level cores in development, which were rather unsuited to the performance requirements of android. reply qwery 4 hours agoparentprev> They expect developers to get ready?No, I don&#x27;t think they do in a general sense. It&#x27;s in the title: \"What you need to know to be ready\" --> if you would like to be ready, we have some information&#x2F;advice for you. You can take it or leave it.% Note: I&#x27;m using the word \"you\" here as it is used in the title, not you specifically. reply Lammy 4 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;One_(pronoun) :) reply circuit10 2 hours agorootparent\"The pronoun one often has connotations of formality, and is often avoided in favour of more colloquial alternatives such as generic you.\" reply saagarjha 8 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s because nobody shipped devices that mattered with that architecture. reply Georgelemental 7 hours agorootparentCould the causal chain go the other way? (Nobody shipped any devices with that architecture, because app availability was too low) reply roneythomas6 5 hours agorootparentNo, For x86, They were fine when all mobile CPU&#x27;s where Single and Dual core. Intel actually had upper hand for a short time thanks to hyperthreading. But once Qualcomm and other ARM SOCs jumped to Quad core, Intel CPU&#x27;s where power in-efficient and slow compared to other ARM SOCs. So they gave up Smartphone and concentrated on tablet chips for Android and Win8 devices. Later they gave up the Android tablets mainly due to cheap ARM chips from Mediatek and others. As for MIPS they gave up on making SOCs for Android after Imagination Technologies acquired it in 2013. Also keep in mind Smartphone&#x27;s where growing double digit market share in early 2010&#x27;s and developers were definitely eager to support whatever new architecture to get market share. Even though there is no x86 smartphone or tablet anymore, the app support is quite good thanks to Chromebooks, Google Play Games for Windows and Android app support in Windows. reply toast0 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s possible, but I think the more likely issue is nobody shipped very many devices with x86, because Intel cancelled development of x86 for phones[1] before they had many design wins.Also, and I missed this at the time, it seems like Qualcomm was restricting manufacturers from also using competitors chips[2], although it seems the ruling was reversed on appeal [3], there&#x27;s still evidence of restrictions. It would be unappealing to market an x86 device if it means losing access to Qualcomm cpus, especially in an era where Qualcomm modems were practically mandatory, so it makes sense that the only x86 (Asus Zenphone) I can think of is made by a company that didn&#x27;t make a lot of phones.Personally, I don&#x27;t think the lack of app support would have been that much of a problem for sales of phones in the 2012 to 2016 time frame. If you got a couple hundred thousand phones out there, app developers would add support, because it wasn&#x27;t too hard, a lot of developers were running x86 Android emulators, and they may have already had the x86 native code libraries and just didn&#x27;t ship them because why bother when there&#x27;s no phones.Some of the first generation Asus Zenphone ran on x86, and it might have been rough for a while, but I think they sold reasonable numbers, and app developers started shipping x86 libraries. I don&#x27;t know when Google Play added support for ABI specific APKs, maybe that was a factor too (if you have to have everything you support in the APK, then you&#x27;ll be careful about what you support)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;414673&#x2F;intel-is-on-the-verge...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;05&#x2F;22&#x2F;tech&#x2F;qualcomm-antitrust&#x2F;index...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-qualcomm-antitrust-idUSKC... reply mianos 4 hours agorootparentprevThere are quite a few x86 Chromebooks, millions. If you have one it is kinda surprising just how many Android apps run on them. (Or is it all emulated?) reply baq 3 hours agorootparentThe not-jvm apps should just work. Apps using binary libraries may be AOT-translated by Google or be jitted on device. The tech was there about a decade ago specifically for Android (look up Houdini) but in general is as old as the hills. reply a-dub 6 hours agoparentprevif you don&#x27;t use the ndk, isn&#x27;t it, in fact, zero work?how prevalent is ndk use? games and multimedia apps maybe? reply Vt71fcAqt7 8 hours agoparentprevMost java only apps will Just Work as you just add another compiler option. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentWhat compiler option would a pure Java app even need?Android apps aren&#x27;t AOT-compiled to any specific architecture at build time; that happens after installation on the device itself. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentSmall correction, on Android 5 and 6, it happened during installation hence why it took ages, and an hybrid interpreter&#x2F;JIT&#x2F;AOT toolchain was introduced in 7.Nowadays AOT compilation happens when the device is idle, taking into account either the generated PGO metadata gathered by the JIT, or the one downloaded alongside the APK at installation time. reply Sparkyte 6 hours agoparentprevI just expect better compilers. Having a diverse platform is very healthy, but it is completely unreasonable to expect people to keep switching technology if it isn&#x27;t easy to adopt. reply leonidbelyaev 8 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t think that makes sense. RISC-V is by definition a new ISA, M1 is based on the existing ARM ISA. reply gumby 7 hours agorootparentThat transition was from x86 to ARM.This is ARM to RISC V. reply spookie 7 hours agorootparentFrom a mature architecture to another, versus going to a \"pretty much only used on embedded devices\" arch?Yeah, they really have got their work cut out for themselves! reply IshKebab 2 hours agorootparentAndroid phones are pretty much embedded devices though (unfortunately) so I suspect we&#x27;ll see a load of phones that have super custom kernels with tons of hard-coded driver configs etc. Similar to SBC other than the RPi.It&#x27;s kind of an issue for ARM too but they&#x27;re a bit further towards solving it than RISC-V.In any case it&#x27;s mainly a problem for people that want OS updates or the ability to install other OSes, so it&#x27;s not going to affect app writers or normal users much. reply snvzz 2 hours agorootparent>It&#x27;s kind of an issue for ARM too but they&#x27;re a bit further towards solving it than RISC-V.Can you elaborate on why you think so?I understand it is the opposite: RISC-V is much further towards solving it.This is because RISC-V has put effort from the start into standardizing boot process (spl -> sbi -> uboot|uefi), ISA (profiles), the firmware-kernel interface (sbi, uefi protocol, acpi) as well as the platform itself (platform spec, standards for interrupts, timers, hypervisor support, the uart requirement, the watchdog and further platform standardization efforts).This has happened (and is happening still) before significant deployment of SoCs using RISC-V microarchitectures as the application processor.Meanwhile, ARM realized, quite late, that this is important, and is lagging behind, with plenty of non-fixable, bespoke platform hardware deployed, and low vendor uptake as they are asking their clients to change what they already have in place. replytripdout 9 hours agoprevSidenote, but when I learned of the new AOSP emulator, for some reason I thought that to use the Cuttlefish emulator (as opposed to Goldfish) with AOSP, you needed to run `acloud`, which refused to run unless I was on Ubuntu. I tried the LD_PRELOAD hack where you can replace the `uname` function output, but then it started trying to run dpkg (I use NixOS).The old emulator is a real pain to get working, and the new one comes with many benefits.Somehow I never knew you could just run `launch_cvd` manually. reply tadfisher 6 hours agoparentIf I don&#x27;t remember, please report a feature request on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tadfisher&#x2F;android-nixpkgs so we can get this packaged, at least in my SDK repo. reply tripdout 6 hours agorootparentOh, hey!

And it&#x27;s not like you can change it. You can&#x27;t buy a RISC-V CPU and fiddle with the design, you don&#x27;t get the source nor the toolchain. All you get are the man pages, and guess what? You get those with x86 and ARM, too! reply jowea 8 hours agorootparentprevThe indirect effect of open source software are really strong though. It only takes one coder to remove an anti-feature that the devs decided to include and publish. reply stefan_ 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat are the indirect effects? You realize the least troubling part of making Android run on some proprietary hardware was the ARM processor? That part is perfectly fine!It&#x27;s the graphics card, the display hardware, the camera, the video encoding&#x2F;decoding - these are all proprietary, undocumented blobs of IP with no upstream support. Your RISCV Android phone is still going to have all of those, it makes exactly zero difference. reply rockemsockem 7 hours agorootparentWouldn&#x27;t the main indirect effect be that it&#x27;s easier for new companies to enter the smartphone space due to reduced costs from the ISA being open? I&#x27;d expect that to take a while, but wouldn&#x27;t that be the main benefit? reply acdha 6 hours agorootparentThe cost of developing a competitive CPU is high, and then you have to package the whole thing into a SoC and optimize for power usage, support it for years, etc. The ISA is not the limiting factor there. reply rockemsockem 5 hours agorootparentAs another commenter already pointed out, open source tends to build on open source, so I&#x27;d expect more and more complex chips to be built on the platform over time in the open.

It won’t do you any good, though: the feedback loop to get the open source gradual but exponential improvement engine working is too long and too expensive for hobbyists.It possibly could work with a community of companies, but my imagination stops there, can’t see how mbas could ever agree to giving away differentiators when fixed costs are so high, it’d destroy margins. reply snvzz 5 hours agorootparentprev>The cost of developing a competitive CPU is highIt can be dodged by either licensing some of the hundreds of commercial core designs available, or by using one of the (several) available open source RISC-V implementations.Other competitive ISAs also have a few -albeit not anywhere as many- open source implementations, but there&#x27;s no dodging the ISA royalty fee on these. reply saagarjha 8 hours agorootparentprevThe indirect effects of proprietary extensions, which means your software isn&#x27;t portable anymore? reply ongy 3 hours agoparentprevThe blog post is by the open source office in Google, not specifically the android teamAnd so far entirely about AOSP and getting that running.GApps (the non-free part) isn&#x27;t mentioned at all.

Voreinstellung zur Sichtbarkeit der Mitgliederprofile auf Partnerseiten des Unternehmens ist unzulässig. In einem Teilurteil hatte das LG Berlin zuvor bereits den ungebetenen Versand von E-Mails an Nichtmitglieder verboten. Quelle: tete_escape - AdobeStock Das soziale Netzwerk LinkedIn darf auf seiner Webseite nicht mehr mitteilen, dass es auf „Do-Not-Track“-Signale nicht reagiert, mit denen Nutzer:innen der Nachverfolgung („Tracking“) ihres Surfverhaltens per Browsereinstellung widersprechen. Das hat das Landgericht Berlin nach einer Klage des Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands (vzbv) entschieden. Das Gericht untersagte dem Unternehmen außerdem eine Voreinstellung, nach der das Profil des Mitglieds auch auf anderen Webseiten und Anwendungen sichtbar ist. Bereits im vergangenen Jahr hatte das Gericht den ungebetenen Versand von E-Mails an Nichtmitglieder untersagt. „Wenn Verbraucher:innen die ,Do-Not-Track‘-Funktion ihres Browsers aktivieren, ist das eine klare Botschaft: Sie wollen nicht, dass ihr Surfverhalten für Werbe- und andere Zwecke ausgespäht wird“, sagt Rosemarie Rodden, Rechtsreferenin beim vzbv. „Webseitenbetreiber müssen dieses Signal respektieren.“ Widerspruch gegen Tracking ignoriert Internetsurfer:innen können über ihren Browser einstellen, dass die besuchten Webseiten ein „Do-Not-Track“ (DNT)-Signal erhalten. Es übermittelt ihren Wunsch, dass die Online-Aktivitäten nicht nachverfolgt und ausgewertet werden. LinkedIn hatte auf seiner Internetseite mitgeteilt, dass es auf solche DNT-Signale nicht reagiert. Somit können auch gegen den Willen der Nutzer:innen personenbezogene Daten wie die IP-Adresse und Informationen über die Nutzung der Webseite etwa für Analyse- und Marketingzwecke ausgewertet werden, auch von Drittanbietern. Das Landgericht Berlin schloss sich der Auffassung des vzbv an, dass die Mitteilung des Unternehmens irreführend war. Sie suggeriere, dass die Benutzung des DNT-Signals rechtlich irrelevant sei und die Beklagte ein solches Signal nicht zu beachten brauche. Das treffe nicht zu. Das Widerspruchsrecht gegen die Verarbeitung persönlicher Daten könne nach der Datenschutzgrundverordnung auch per automatisierten Verfahren ausgeübt werden. Ein DNT-Signal stelle einen wirksamen Widerspruch dar. Einen weiteren Antrag in diesem Zusammenhang lehnte das Gericht aus prozessualen Gründen ab. Profil ohne erforderliche Einwilligung veröffentlicht In allen weiteren Punkten war die vzbv-Klage ohne Einschränkung erfolgreich. Das Gericht untersagte LinkedIn, bei der erstmaligen Anmeldung die Funktion „Sichtbarkeit des Profils“ zu aktivieren. Durch diese Voreinstellung war das persönliche LinkedIn-Profil ohne Zustimmung auch für Nicht-Mitglieder sowie außerhalb des Netzwerkes – etwa auf Suchmaschinen – öffentlich sichtbar. Die Richter:innen stellten klar, dass ein von vornherein aktivierter Schalter nicht die Anforderungen an eine wirksame Einwilligung in die Veröffentlichung personenbezogener Daten erfüllt. „Nutzerprofile dürfen nicht automatisch öffentlich einsehbar sein, wenn sie angelegt werden“, so Rosemarie Rodden. Ungebetener E-Mail-Versand verboten Einem Teil der Klage hatte das LG Berlin bereits im vergangenen Jahr stattgegeben. So ist es LinkedIn inzwischen verboten, E-Mail-Einladungen an Verbraucher:innen zu versenden, die nicht Mitglied des Netzwerks sind und die der Verwendung ihrer E-Mail-Adresse nicht zugestimmt haben. Außerdem untersagte das Gericht in einem weiteren Teil-Anerkenntnisurteil die Verwendung mehrerer Bestimmungen in den Geschäftsbedingungen des Unternehmens, darunter Klauseln, nach denen nur die englische Vertragsfassung verbindlich sein soll und ein Rechtsstreit nur im irischen Dublin ausgetragen werden darf.

This was decided by the Berlin Regional Court after a lawsuit by the Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband (vzbv). The court also prohibited the company from setting a preset, according to which the member&#x27;s profile is also visible on other websites and applications.\"...\"If consumers activate the \"Do Not Track\" function of their browser, this is a clear message: They do not want their surfing behaviour to be spied on for advertising and other purposes,\" says Rosemarie Rodden, legal lecturer at vzbv. \"Website operators must respect this signal.\"...\"The District Court of Berlin agreed with the opinion of the vzbv that the company&#x27;s communication was misleading. It suggests that the use of the DNT signal was legally irrelevant and that the defendant does not have to pay attention to such a signal. That&#x27;s not true. According to the General Data Protection Regulation, the right to object to the processing of personal data can also be exercised by automated procedures. A DNT signal is an effective contradiction.\" reply frereubu 17 minutes agoparentThis is fantastic, and I hope it stands up on the presumably inevitable appeal. It&#x27;s the most obvious way of eventually getting rid of per-site cookie notices - make DNT legally enforceable and cookie notices become irrelevant for people who have it switched on. I run an agency that builds websites for non-profits and we respect DNT by not tracking and not even displaying the cookie notice. The only thing I&#x27;ve wondered about is whether we show a one-off notice saying \"we note your DNT setting and we&#x27;ve disabled tracking\" just because I wonder if users become suspicious that we&#x27;re tracking them by default if they don&#x27;t see a cookie notice! reply looopTools 31 minutes agoparentprevI think this is really, really good. I hope other European countries follows suite reply Kwastie 7 minutes agorootparentI am not sure this is even required. A (German) legal court order could also be used across the EU as a case law. reply extraduder_ire 1 hour agoparentprevWould this include browsers which have the DNT header enabled by default? I remember early edge&#x2F;late internet explorer defaulting to sending the header, and claimed as much in advertising.The spec itself (at the time, at least) said that it could be ignored if the header was always sent&#x2F;not user-enabled. reply wirrbel 1 hour agorootparentNot a lawyer, but basically the website cannot distinguish whether a DNT setting was enabled by default or whether the user intended to set it so it really does not matter. It must be assumed that the user enabled the DNT setting.Let&#x27;s assume Aunt Agatha reads about the DNT setting in one of her magazines, goes to the browser settings, sees that it&#x27;s enabled, takes no further action. That is no different from Uncle Ulysses who has a different browser with a DNT-disabled default who goes to the settings and enables its.My letterbox has a sticker on it that I don&#x27;t want to receive unsolicited ads. I don&#x27;t need anyone to try to presume that it wasn&#x27;t me who put that sticker onto my letterbox. reply theGeatZhopa 51 minutes agorootparentIt gets better than that. Once, I&#x27;ve seen &#x2F; caught in the act &#x2F; one ads-distributee who damaged the sticker on my box&#x27; lid. He was scratching it with a key. Then, suddenly vanished after seeing me.After that, I got ads put into my box again. Once I asked one distributee if he can&#x27;t see the sticker.. \"it&#x27;s damaged. So I thought you wanted to remove that, but it made problems so yo left it striken through\" reply medstrom 39 minutes agorootparentI have trouble believing that&#x27;s real. Why would these workers bother? reply kapep 0 minutes agorootparentI have no idea why they bother but the sticker on my post box and those of some neighbors were removed the third time now in the last 2 years. I know that they didn&#x27;t remove them themselves because I talked with them and gave them new stickers. The kids in the house are either too small or to old to remove them so I can only assume it&#x27;s the people distributing flyers. It sure is not the postman, he actually wrote a note asking everyone to put up those stickers because he didn&#x27;t want to carry stuff that ends up in the trash anyway. darkwater 23 minutes agorootparentprevThe same reason we put 2-3 of them in the same letterbox or we trashed some packs at the end of a street (yeah I did that back in the &#x27;90s as a teenager). To work less and earn the same. reply rhighhtfjhg 30 minutes agorootparentprevIf you are paid by ad distributed wouldn’t you want to try to maximize the number of ads delivered in to the same apartment building? reply noirscape 1 hour agorootparentprevSpec largely doesn&#x27;t matter for what the courts think; DNT is considered by them to be a valid signal for not wanting to be tracked in the eyes of the court according to the ruling. (note: I am not a lawyer.)You could argue that by using a browser where the DNT header is set by default, they are making that decision on their privacy by y&#x27;know, using those browsers over the ones where they&#x27;re not set by default. Ad companies don&#x27;t want that argument, they want you to opt out in every browser (and ideally they&#x27;d just ignore the header entirely, which they do after Microsoft enabled it by default in Explorer). reply xxs 1 hour agorootparentprev>Would this include browsers which have the DNT header enabled by defaultIt&#x27;s EU - the default is to require consent for using personal data (which in at least few of the jurisdictions IPs are included). The the &#x27;default&#x27; should be out. reply joking 1 hour agorootparentand what you do if the user gives consent and still send the DNT header? reply geocar 46 minutes agorootparentYou either have consent or you do not. Mixed signals do not permit you to err to your benefit.EU courts have already ruled that \"cookie banners\" that are too-confusing aren&#x27;t considered consent. reply naniwaduni 8 minutes agorootparentprevDoes it become harder to figure out when your salary depends on not understanding it or something? reply xxs 1 hour agorootparentprevthe latest date consent given (or taken away) takes precedence, consent requires an clear&affirmative action, so if that part can be recorded - do as you please. reply c4mpute 14 minutes agorootparentWould be irrelevant, because the DNT-header will be sent with every request, so for all practical purposes will be later than any other kind of consent. reply esperent 14 minutes agorootparentprevI guess the person above you means what if someone clicks \"accept\" on the cookie banner but also has DNT turned on.To which I&#x27;d say: they shouldn&#x27;t even see the cookie banner in that case. DNT alone is enough. reply fweimer 1 hour agorootparentprevIf the user installs a privacy-focused browser (NB: not sure if such things exist, marketing aside), one could argue that there is still user choice involved even though the browser sets DNT by default.The original Internet Explorer situation was different because it came pre-installed with the operating system, and whether there is choice in operating systems for any given piece of consumer hardware is often rather dubious today (and was probably “no” in more cases back then). reply wirrbel 1 hour agorootparent> If the user installs a privacy-focused browser (NB: not sure if such things exist, marketing aside), one could argue that there is still user choice involved even though the browser sets DNT by default.it doesn&#x27;t need to be argued as the fact that the user did not disable the DNT option in such a browser is the action that matters. reply ahofmann 1 hour agorootparentprev> The spec itself (at the time, at least) said that it could be ignored if the header was always sent&#x2F;not user-enabled.How would that work? Has the server a mechanism to check if DNT was set by default on the client&#x2F;browser? reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentNo, the idea was exactly do prevent browsers from enabling DNT as the default. The spec would expect the server to check the User Agent and ignore the DNT header entirely if it comes from a user agent which is known to default it to true.Obviously, this was a ploy to gut the standard while still pretending to self-regulate. reply amelius 1 hour agorootparentprev> The spec itself (at the time, at least) said that it could be ignored if the header was always sent&#x2F;not user-enabled.Why? reply noirscape 1 hour agorootparentIIRC the people who wrote the spec did it in co-operation with the larger ad networks and this was the only way they could get the ad networks to comply with it.Then Microsoft enabled it by default in Explorer 10 and the ad networks took it as carte blanche to ignore the DNT header forever, claiming Microsoft had violated the agreement. Nowadays it&#x27;s usually not set even by the overly privacy conscious out of fingerprinting concerns, since its another unique way to identify your traffic. reply fweimer 1 hour agorootparentprevI suspect it was just the conservative choice, mirroring the behavior of the predecessor browser extension (which also required deliberate user action to activate): http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paranoia.dubfire.net&#x2F;2011&#x2F;01&#x2F;history-of-do-not-track-...I couldn&#x27;t find any explicit discussion of that aspect of the spec (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datatracker.ietf.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;html&#x2F;draft-mayer-do-not-tra... is an early version), but I suspect that as noirscape wrote, it made consensus-building easier. Not that it mattered in the end, of course. reply preciousoo 1 hour agorootparentprevQuoting the (Google Translated) article:> According to the General Data Protection Regulation, the right to object to the processing of personal data can also be exercised using automated procedures. A DNT signal represents an effective contradiction.I assume automated procedures include default settings. Not a lawyer and not from the EU though reply jacquesm 1 hour agorootparentprevCourts are not necessarily bound by such a spec, but it doesn&#x27;t look as if that question was addressed here and in my view it would have to be established by another case because for sure the companies that ignore do not track right now will be more than happy to pretend that they have an excuse to continue to do so. This is a long drawn out rearguard fight. reply Ekaros 35 minutes agorootparentprevWhy cannot we expect people wanting to tracking to be smart enough and go disable it? Sounds even more reasonable way to think about it. reply c4mpute 15 minutes agorootparentprevGDPR specifies tracking to be necessarily default-off and opt-in anyways. Therefore the browser sending DNT:1 by default would just repeat the legal status quo. A tracker could not successfully argue that this is to be ignored, because the technical default that the browser sends is the legal default anyways. reply okr 48 minutes agoparentprevNice! So announcing \"Keine Werbung\" on my letter box becomes now also a legal binding? I also wonder about all the announcement on t-shirts. Hmm. reply throwbadubadu 44 minutes agorootparentIt always has been already for a long time.. (a \"Keine Werbung\" sticker is enough to indicate you don&#x27;t want it)?!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dejure.org&#x2F;gesetze&#x2F;UWG&#x2F;7.htmlSure, theory and practice and sueing offenders are all different things, however most obey that here I&#x27;d say? reply worklaptopacct 23 minutes agorootparentIn practice, \"Keine Werbung\" means \"No advertisements except for moving services\". These are the only ones that don&#x27;t give a shit. reply tommiegannert 0 minutes agorootparentOutside Zürich, I see small-time car dealers, small-time precious metals dealers, delivered pizza and kebab from neighboring villages.Perhaps advertisement is only something big companies do? &#x2F;s mr_mitm 6 minutes agorootparentprevIn my experience, it&#x27;s food delivery services. reply isodev 41 minutes agorootparentprevIt should … the “no ads” mailbox stickers are legally binding in Belgium. In fact, you can’t send mail spam to people without opt-in consent. reply przmk 13 minutes agorootparentThey are? Sure doesn&#x27;t stop people from randomly dropping garbage ads in your mailbox. reply x2rj 40 minutes agorootparentprevIs is legally binding since the 80s in Germany.

Take your silly practices back to Germany, I don&#x27;t need to label my postbox NOT TO RECEIVE your spam over here. \"No spam\" is the default without any label. reply jauntywundrkind 1 hour agoparentprevThat would be a major upheaval.This one feels legit; DNT has been around (and ignored by everyone) for a long long time. But the summary here is saying, oh, the consumer signalled something so sites have to obey. It feels like fools could make up all kinds of arbitrary signalling systems packaging all manners of data handling directives to sites.So, what if any limits does the court see or allow? If DNT is something sites have to obey, what&#x27;s something sites wouldn&#x27;t have to obey? And how do sites become aware of all the different mechanized ways consumers might send processing directives to them? reply fxtentacle 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;d say website should be required to honour any signal that more than 1 mio potential users know about. That seems like a fair trade-off between pushing work onto companies while simultaneously closing laziness as a loophole. reply wirrbel 53 minutes agorootparentprevI assume you are asking in good faith.I could configure my browser to add some custom headers to my HTTP requests, like `DONTDOTHISTHINGTHATISIMPORTANTTOME` or something. I don&#x27;t think courts would accept that, as it&#x27;s not an established interface &#x2F; protocol, and furthermore GDPR does in fact allow for data-processing if it&#x27;s needed &#x2F; required to offer the service.By providing an interface standard, however, the browser vendors have kind of set the stage for the courts accepting DNT as a valid communication medium for the service consumer to state intent to the service provider. This is akin to the courts taking into account how the card-payment terminal works when ruling on matters of card-payment in stores, etc. reply nvm0n2 33 minutes agorootparentYou don&#x27;t think courts would accept that, but you don&#x27;t know, because EU privacy law is so vague and badly written that the courts regularly \"discover\" new things about it that nobody had previously considered possible. For example the fact that everyone had a right to remove stuff from search engines if it was about yourself was never written into law by any elected body or even any non-elected body. It was a right that a court simply invented. Ditto for not being able to use Google Fonts.The EU has had problems with this kind of activist lawmaking for a long time. It&#x27;s one of the factors behind Brexit. Some Leave campaigners argued that it was impossible to make any kind of deal or compromise with the EU if it meant staying in, because no matter how clearly written it appeared to be and no matter how watertight the international treaty encoding it was, the European courts would simply ignore it and&#x2F;or rule it invalid. This criticism landed because there was precedent for that, where the courts had previously done exactly the same thing with other agreements. The same debate is now playing out around the ECHR as well, which the UK stayed in because it&#x27;s not technically an EU court, just a European court. Same cultural issues though. reply krageon 1 hour agorootparentprevThis legal proceeding is about do not track. It is not about anything else which you&#x27;re pulling in. This is an appeal to ridicule and these are generally not very interesting. reply dalbasal 1 hour agoprevMost of the pseudo-contract BS that defines consumer-company relations is trash legal theory. It should have never held water in the first place.The fact that our legal systems have tolerated and supported it, mostly demonstrates how intellectually weak the legal profession&#x27;s philosophy and ethic is.Companies, especially interacting digitally, use TCs, EULAs and other such nonsense like an incantation. Those are not agreements. They are stupid little rituals that strip users&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;whoever of all rights.Any right that can be stripped by TCs... doesn&#x27;t exist.The whole concept of \"by agreement\" in these circumstances is bogus but... If it must be this way... Stack the deck in the other direction.\"By serving this browser a webpage, you agree to the following...\"By dripping a cookie, by recording this person&#x27;s data.

Now let&#x27;s see this taken up by the EU courts as well if they are challenged on this. But my guess is that the advertising world would rather do this on a country-by-country basis rather than to risk losing in all of the EU at once. reply reddalo 48 minutes agoparentI&#x27;d love if this became a EU-wide law. If you send the DNT header, then you can&#x27;t get cookie consent alerts since you already do not consent being tracked. reply nvm0n2 29 minutes agorootparentAlternative reading: if mechanized expression of consent is now possible, then if you send a different header \"Tracking-OK: True\" all the cookie consent banners should now disappear.It could be a great thing. 99%+ of all people would quickly learn to opt in to tracking to get rid of the annoying popups. reply dns_snek 13 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s an impossible reading, tracking requires informed consent.

Even in this case it&#x27;s not uncommon that national courts will look across the border. reply myspy 1 hour agoprevI still don&#x27;t get why websites are not able to find in-house ad solutions that are not provided by third parties. Major sites look like shit due to ads placed without thought or care. This should be handled like magazine or newspaper ads. People selecting and placing them in the page with care. Would result in a better experience and wouldn&#x27;t require any tracking.I think that tracking to get \"good ads\" is a wish that never came true and it needs people with taste to choose products people would like to buy. reply jacquesm 1 hour agoparentThat&#x27;s because of the silo formation in the advertising market. Agencies want to have an easy time to spend a large budget and they don&#x27;t want to negotiate individually with thousands of parties. So they do a bulk buy from some large provider which then provides a centralized way to return the statistics. These serve to - somewhat - keep property owners honest because both click fraud and placement fraud would probably be rampant.Not every kind of advertising is that suspect to fraud but for every budget out there there is some way to siphon it off without giving the advertiser what they were looking for. It&#x27;s been an arms race between fraudsters and marketeers with the end-users caught in the middle, and between the marketeers and the users with respect to privacy issues. This ruling injects some sanity for those that have declared themselves to be non-combatants. reply pjc50 48 minutes agoparentprevThe market is full of fraud, and the surveillance exists as a counter to the fraud.

    "originBody": "Threads Software Limited Gives Meta’s Instagram 30 Days to Desist from Using the Service Name Threads October 30, 2023 04:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UK software company Threads Software Limited and its lawyers have today (30 October) written to Meta’s Instagram giving it 30 days to stop using the name Threads for their service in the UK. If it does not, Threads Software Limited will seek an injunction from the English Courts. “We want them to stop using the Threads name with immediate effect. If they do not, we will seek an injunction from the UK courts.” Post this Threads - an intelligent message hub provided by Threads Software Limited - was conceived and trademarked in 2012 by JPY Ltd. The service has been actively promoted worldwide since 2014. In 2018, the first commercial sale was made in the USA, and as a result JPY Ltd spun off a new company, Threads Software Ltd. It has since licenced nearly 1,000 organisations worldwide with sales currently growing at 200% a year. From April 2023, Meta’s lawyers made four offers to purchase the domain ‘threads.app’ from Threads Software Ltd. Every offer was declined. It was made clear to Meta’s Instagram that the domain was not for sale. In July 2023, Meta’s Instagram announced its ‘threads’ social media platform and removed Threads Software Limited from its Facebook platform. Dr John Yardley, Managing Director of Threads Software Ltd said: “Taking on a US$150 billion company is not an easy decision for us to make. We have invested 10 years in our platform, establishing a recognised brand in the name, Threads. Our business now faces a serious threat from one of the largest technology companies in the world. “We recognise that this is a classic ‘David and Goliath’ battle with Meta. And whilst they may think they can use whatever name they want, that does not give them the right to use the Threads brand name. “We want them to stop using the Threads name with immediate effect. If they do not, we will seek an injunction from the UK courts.” About Threads Software Threads is a Cloud-based service that captures, transcribes, and organises all of a company’s digital messages (emails and phone calls) into one easily searchable database. Message meta-data is extracted to automatically and intelligently create a subscriber-specific address book, eliminating the need to manually maintain directories of contacts and companies. Threads is able to provide high-quality transcriptions by extracting VoIP call and routing data at much greater resolution than most call recording systems. Additionally, by intelligently processing email data, Threads can apply vital context to phone calls and further improve its understanding of speech.

Is there any way that Meta doesn&#x27;t lose&#x2F;settle this? reply rickboyce 15 hours agoparent(Not a lawyer, but have gained some working knowledge of UK trademarks.)I don’t think this is totally clean cut. UK trademarks are registered against specific classes and those classes are categorised in families of goods and services.A quick search suggests that this company holds the trademark for the word ‘Threads’ for class 9 (goods) and class 42 (services).You can read the definitions somewhere by searching on gov.uk (or somewhere like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.russell-cooke.co.uk&#x2F;media&#x2F;bmin5fo0&#x2F;goods_and_ser... [pdf]).Meta will almost certainly make the argument that they are not operating in these classes or overlapping with the categories listed for this trademark. Class 42 does not seem to apply here, and for class 9 the Thread trademark lists ‘computer software, software and apparatus for the extraction of business information and knowledge’ which may not overlap.Meta couldn’t also trademark Threads under class 9 (can’t trademark the same word twice in the same class) but just because they can’t secure the trademark does not automatically mean they are infringing on the existing use.They could argue that their use of Threads as a trademark falls solely within something like class 38: Telecommunications services; chat room services; portal services; e-mail services; providing user access to the Internet; radio and television broadcasting.If they could land this then there is no claim against them - their use can coexist with trademark’s registered in different classes.For an app which can be downloaded getting around class 9 could be difficult - so whether they could land and make this stick is far from clear, but Meta have the resources to explore this indefinitely where as the pre-existing user making the complaint may not be able to afford the legal costs to stay the course.Trademarks are messy and subjective and there is much scope for interpretation - even a seemly clear-cut case is anything but predictable. reply Nitrolo 15 hours agorootparentLawyer in training here!Trademarks do get grouped into classes (the so called \"Nice Classification\", like the French city [0]). The classes are very detailed, and the first 34 refer to \"Goods\", the rest to \"Services\".Specifically class 9 refers to (among many other things), \"computers, computer software\", class 42 to \"design and development of computer hardware and software\".However those are mostly just to simplify searching for and dealing with the huge amount of trademarks. Each trademark comes with its own list of goods and services it&#x27;s supposed to cover. Their trademark in the UK [1] covers \"computer software, software and apparatus for the extraction of business information and knowledge\".They also appear to have registered a trademark this september [2] with a much broader scope, so after Meta started using threads.

Owning a domain name doesn&#x27;t mean you own exclusive rights for the trademark ---in that space---. Uzi Nissan (who I&#x27;ve just found out died, R.I.P), couldn&#x27;t demand Nissan stop selling cars with Nissan, just because he owned Nissan.com, and wouldn&#x27;t sell it.(sidenote: nissan.com is currently inaccessible to me. I wonder what&#x27;ll happen to that domain, given the aforementioned death).EDIT: I used the words \"in that space\", was the wrong train of thought there, my bad. reply jedberg 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s because Mr. Nissan doesn&#x27;t sell cars.

This has happened before. Maybe it&#x27;s not fair, but it&#x27;s extremely foreseeable. It seems much easier to me to choose a creative name in the first place than to risk a legal battle wherein you have to prove that really you should be able to use that dictionary word because you thought of it first. As other commenters have pointed out, since Threads (Meta) and Threads (software) operate in different spaces, Threads&#x27;s (software) claim for exclusivity is tenuous anyway. reply polishTar 15 hours agorootparentprevPrecisely. If you chose your product&#x2F;company name to be a common word in the english language you should expect it to be more difficult to exclude others from using it too.
