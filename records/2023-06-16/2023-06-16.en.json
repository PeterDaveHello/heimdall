The most important thing for him to hear is to fucking stop acting like a 5 cent thug and start behaving like a grownup with responsibilities.

I can't believe a major website has such an awful website other than to force you to use their app which also isn't very good.And so I just barely go on Reddit on my phone anymore. My PC usage hasn't increased because of it, and I only use the PC because RES makes the site tolerable to look at.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]S_A_N_D_ 8 points 12 hours ago Yup, This is how I see things going for myself as well.

    "content": "Reddit Threatens to Remove Moderators From Subreddits Continuing Apollo-Related BlackoutsThursday June 15, 2023 3:20 pm PDT by Juli CloverAs some subreddits continue blackouts to protest Reddit's plans to charge high prices for its API, Reddit has informed the moderators of those subreddits that it has plans to replace resistant moderation teams to keep spaces \"open and accessible to users.\"In a comment shared by r/Apple moderator @aaronp613, Reddit cited its Moderator Code of Conduct and said that it has a duty to keep communities \"relied upon by thousands or even millions of users\" operational. Mods who do not agree to reopen subreddits that have gone private will be removed.If a moderator team unanimously decides to stop moderating, we will invite new, active moderators to keep these spaces open and accessible to users. If there is no consensus, but at least one mod wants to keep the community going, we will respect their decisions and remove those who no longer want to moderate from the mod team.Between Monday and Wednesday of this week, the majority of popular subreddits on the Reddit site participated in a \"blackout\" and went private or stopped allowing new posts to be made in order to protest planned API changes that will cause the shutdown of popular third-party Reddit apps like Apollo.Reddit is just digging the hole deeper and deeper. They are essentially threatening moderators of subreddits that are blacking out indefinitely that they will be removed. https://t.co/IeU3inmyf4 pic.twitter.com/HF4t3EO1JS \u2014 Aaron (@aaronp613) June 15, 2023The move was aimed at pushing Reddit to enact fairer pricing for developers and to give developers more time to adopt the API changes, but Reddit opted to wait out the protests rather than make adjustments.As a result, some subreddits such as r/Apple made the decision to continue the blackout indefinitely, which means millions of Reddit users no longer have access to those communities. It seems Reddit plans to forcibly end further blackouts by removing entire moderation teams that are participating.On Monday, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that the blackouts had not caused \"any significant revenue impact so far\" and that while there was a \"lot of noise\" amid the planned two-day protest, it would \"pass.\" In an interview with The Verge today, Huffman further said that Reddit's API was \"never designed to support third-party apps\" and that the apps don't add much value to the site. Reddit created its API for \"tools, bots and enhancements to Reddit,\" according to Huffman.Huffman confirmed that the blackouts have made no change to Reddit's API pricing plan. \"That's our business decision, and we're not undoing that business decision,\" said Huffman. Huffman said in the interview that Reddit will not force communities to reopen, which contradicts the messaging that moderators are receiving.Reddit also just published a blog post with \"key facts\" about the API updates. In the post, Reddit says that \"dissent, debate, and discussions are foundational parts of Reddit,\" and that it respects the right of its community to protest, so long as mods follow the Moderator Code of Conduct. The Moderator Code of Conduct is what Reddit is citing in messaging to moderators about moderation teams being removed from closed communities.Moderators and Reddit users are unhappy with Reddit's decision to charge an unreasonable amount for its API, and for the short 30-day timeline that third-party developers have been given to adopt the new API fees.Apollo developer Christian Selig determined that adopting the API would cost him $20 million per year, leading him to decide to shut down his app on June 30, a day before Reddit begins charging. As of July 1, there will be few if any third-party apps for viewing Reddit content, pushing Reddit users to either the Reddit website or the Reddit app.Tags: Apollo, Reddit[ 290 comments ]",

The DEC PDP-8 is my favorite retro computer and Office 2003 is the best version ever released IMHO. One of my other favorite retro devices is the HP Jornada 720. A small handheld PC (smaller than a netbook) running Windows CE or in my case, Linux. It has a decent keyboard, CFL backlit screen, 32 MB of RAM(!), a compact Flash card for storage and a stylus for the resistive touchscreen. Oh and I got a 10Mbit PCMCIA network card, but wireless cards are also still available. It might be old, released in 1999, but can do one thing your modern iPhone can't.You can develop, compile and run native software on it. It has a C and C++ compiler, Python is available as well as Perl so it is a full fledged development workstation. Not only can you develop software on it, it can run that software as well.Recently I removed all Google Ads from this site due to their invasive tracking, as well as Google Analytics.

NCommander has an excellent video on the 680e and the use of the device at the Dutch Railways (NS). In the past I also had a NS 680e but the battery went bad, bricking the entire unit, so I sadly had to throw that away. The Jornada 720 cost me 80 EUR on the Dutch CraigsList (marktplaats), used, but boxed including the manual and software CD-ROM.Gaming on the HP Jornada, OpenTTD is my favorite game. Doom is also available.Bow for me for I am rootI have a rule that I try to adhere to for devices I own. They must allow a means of root or administrative actions. The Nintendo Switch I got second hand is old enough to be jailbroken. The two Apple devices I own (a first gen iPad Air and first-gen iPhone SE) have vulnerabilities that give me root access. All Android phones I owned I've specifically bought because the bootloader can be unlocked. Once I buy a device, it is mine and I decide what to do with it. Not the manufacturer. Otherwise it is e-waste the moment it leaves the factory.Being able to develop software on a device is almost a must have as well for me. Missing functionality, otherwise known as stuff the manufacturer does not make (enough) money on, can be programmed back in as long as you can develop on a device and are willing to put in enough time and/or money.Or, using a very much capable computer for things the manufacturer did not think of or were no apps for. Remember the Polish garage that still uses a Commodore 64 for their business?Modern phones, both Android and iPhone devices, cannot easily program applications on the device itself, they require a second device, namely a computer (Mac or hackingtosh for iPhones even) that can develop and compile software for the device. And in the case of Apple, it is even up to them to allow you to run software on the device. Such a monopoly should be forbidden by law.Back in the day the Commodore 64 and other home computers booted up into Basic and the only thing you could do was program the device (or start a game). I might be an outlier because my main PC is a Raspberry Pi and my backup Windows laptop is a 2014 Medion model, but with an upgraded SSD and more RAM. The Intel Core i7 in that beast is more than capable, so why replace it?Linux on the Jornada 720 in 2023This HP Jornada, a device released in 1999, allows you to develop and run software on it. A third party linux distro is available, JLime, even in 2023 thanks to HPCfactor. JLime was released around 2008.The JLime desktopSomeone else has a modern Debian working on it. With the full size mini keyboard and 5 hours of battery life mine still has (or more if you replace the cells) it's a perfect little pocket-able device.JLime build version infoI've uploaded the working JLime I use to Archive.org. The HPCFactor version had issues unpacking for me, I think my tar version is too new, it complained about not finding the next header file.A bit of fiddling is required in 2023 to get Linux running. The modern Debian/Devuan is way to slow in my opinion (although a marvel of engineering, getting such a modern distro running on an old device).Mini Mozilla browser on JLimeThe JLime distro, with a 2.6.25 kernel is much faster. For jotting down notes or Pocket Paint or a game of SimCity, Windows CE is fine. Pocket Word is more than capable as is Abiword or your favorite terminal text editor.Jotting down some notes in AbiWordFor software development, Linux is a must. To develop for Windows CE you'll need a PC with Visual Studio, the same issue as modern iPhone's have. There are some GCC versions for Pocket PC lingering online but I couldn't get them to work.Dillo, a text based browser on JLimePartitioning your compact flash card isn't that hard, nor is copying some files to it to run Linux. With the JLime build I'm using GCC is included but the development headers were not, so I couldn't include <iostream> or stdio.h.However, because I have the PCMCIA network card and because HPCfactor still runs an online repository, installing packages is easy, in my case just an ipkg install libstdc++-dev away:Users should be in control of their devicesSo is this realistic? Would I prefer this Jornada over a modern iPhone? Probably not. Would I like an iPhone or iPad that can develop software on it, for itself? Yes absolutely.Is it a technical issue? Totally no, those new devices are more than capable computers. It's purely a management / money issue. Apple does not get their 30% or 15% cut, so they prefer selling you e-waste in the hope that you buy a new one after a year. And of course that accompanying Mac for app development.On the Android side this is a bit better. Often bootloaders can be unlocked allowing for things like PostmarketOS being installed when the device reached its manufacturer-decided end of life (no more software updates on otherwise capable hardware).I have the same Poco F1 as Drew DeVault, also running PostmarketOS. It runs Qt Creator just fine allowing me to program on the device.You can even run Clion (a C++ ide) on Android, or just about any other Linux distro / application on most Android devices via a bunch of different apps. This allows for most Android to surpass the manufacturers end of life due to them no longer providing software updates.Boy do I miss the good old days, where devices were programmable by their owners instead of just e-waste consumption slabs.How many devices do you have lying in a drawer somewhere that are just fine hardware wise, but lack the software updates or development capabilities to be useful today?Tags: apple , blog , c++ , cpp , debian , development , historical , hp , ipad , iphone , jlime , jornada , mobile , openttd , outlook , pda , pocket-pc , windows-ce , windows-mobileHome | About | All pages | Cluster Status | Generated by ingsoc.",

    "content": "Sequence diagrams, the only good thing UML brought to software development15 June 2023\u00b712 minsSequence diagrams really shine when you\u2019re documenting different parts of a system and the various ways these parts interact with each other.A sequence diagram describes the operations within a system and maps what and when messages are sent.In its simplest form, a sequence diagram could model the messages and flow between a user and their bank as they log in to the banking app. In more complex forms, sequence diagrams could include alternatives, options, and loops to model conditional and divergent flows if, say, a login process also includes security, verification, and other user actions.If you haven\u2019t used them extensively, you\u2019ve likely heard of them in one of two contexts: One, in isolation, as a useful type of diagram to consider when writing documentation, or two, as an artifact of the now rarely used Unified Modelling Language (UML) from the late 1990s.In this article, I\u2019m going to briefly dig into the history of UML so we can see how and why sequence diagrams survived despite most of UML getting consigned to the dustbin of software history. Then, I\u2019ll show why sequence diagrams are still valuable and how you can make the best use of them.My interest comes from two sources: I think sequence diagrams are underrated and underused, and I think sequence diagrams are an ideal use case for MermaidChart because it allows users to choose informal simplicity over the rigid complexity that results from using older tools like IBM\u2019s Rational Rose.The rise and fall of UMLUML originally came out in 1997 and as Martin Fowler wrote in the preceding years, the primary purpose was to \u201celiminate the bedlam that had overtaken graphical modeling languages in the object-oriented world.\u201d The basic problem \u2013 one that has been repeated many times throughout the history of software \u2013 is that there was chaos and confusion and a real desire to introduce a standard that would provide clarity.Rational Software started developing UML in 1994; the Object Management Group (OMG) accepted it as a standard in 1997; and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted it as an accepted standard in 2005.The rise of UML saw excitement and criticism even as it became a standard (at least on paper). Many loved it but many either had problems with UML itself or with how people were using it. Death by UML Fever, a 2004 piece from a Boeing software architect, captures some of the complaints.Here, the author writes that \u201cNo other technology has so quickly and deeply permeated the software-engineering life cycle quite like UML\u201d and argues that UML had become a vehicle for people without software experience to design and control the software development process.In the years since, a few obituaries have been written, including a 2018 piece from Ivar Jacobson (who was VP at Rational Software when UML was becoming a standard), a 2021 piece from Hillel Wayne (who interviewed some of the major people from those days, such as Grady Booch and Bertrand Meyer), and a 2022 piece from Laurence Tratt (who was directly involved in UML\u2019s standardization).These pieces are all worth reading but they all settle on an essentially similar explanation: UML got too complex (the UML 2.2 documentation, for example, was over 1,000 pages long and UML became associated with burdensome and often wasteful pre-work.UML\u2019s life beyond deathWe\u2019re talking, at this point, about a methodology that\u2019s almost 30 years old \u2013 a methodology that its proponents and its detractors agree is essentially dead.And yet, as a 2014 study showed \u2013 contrary to the researchers\u2019 own expectations \u2013 most of the developers and software architects they served were creating sketches and diagrams that \u201ccontained at least some UML elements.\u201d The researchers noted that \u201cmost of them were informal,\u201d but still, this is a surprisingly powerful life beyond death.Occasionally, the topic comes up directly and we can see how people talk about modern-day UML. In this HackerNews thread, for example, a user asks whether learning UML is worth their time, and while most users agree UML itself is useless, many also suggest learning a few UML techniques (sequence diagrams chief among them).One user even wrote that \u201cThe reward of the clarity of sequence diagrams is worth the pain and boredom of learning all the others at university,\u201d which is a pretty strong recommendation if I\u2019ve ever seen one. An even stronger recommendation comes from Mark Watson, who co-wrote an entire book about UML but now says that \u201cSequence diagrams are the only type of diagrams I use anymore.\u201dWe can trace the survivability of sequence diagrams back to UML\u2019s origins. In the heyday of UML, Martin Fowler identified three use cases for UML: sketching, blueprinting, and programming.The programming use case died because, according to Hillell Wayne, \u201ceven most proponents of UML considered it a terrible idea.\u201d The blueprinting use case actually appeared to be the strongest one but died out too because the use case had been tied to Rational Software and to CASE tools \u2013 both of which died and took UML with them.The first use case \u2013 sketching \u2013 survived but it \u201cdrifted into multiple, mutually unintelligible dialects,\u201d according to Wayne. Tratt agrees, writing that with hindsight, UML had reached its peak in 2000 \u201cas a medium for software sketching.\u201dA medium for sketching is a much humbler vision than what UML proponents had imagined but we shouldn\u2019t let that undervalue what remains \u2013 especially when it comes to sequence diagrams.Sequence diagrams out of the ashesSequence diagrams survived not just because they were the best of a bad bunch but because they\u2019re genuinely useful. As I wrote above, the gist of sequence diagrams is that you can use them to easily map and visualize the dynamic flow of messages across a system.Message flows can get really complex but sequence diagrams provide two main components that create the backbone of the diagram:Lifelines, which represent objects and the processes between them.Messages, which represent the information exchanged over time.The base components have to be simple because a sequence diagram is meant to represent a system in action, meaning the represented components will be running simultaneously, in order, and in parallel. A good sequence diagram shows the flow, the messages exchanged between objects, and the function performed before the lifeline \u201cdies.\u201dThe primary use cases for sequence diagrams are:Sketching and designing how a system is supposed to work before building it.Documenting the requirements of a new system.Breaking down and understanding an existing (often legacy) system.A sequence diagram can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) capture an entire system so in these use cases, the best methods involve using them to visualize how a system is used, diagram the logical flow of a particular process, or map out the functionality of a service.Sequence diagrams really shine when you\u2019re documenting different parts of a system and the various ways these parts interact with each other. Sequence diagrams don\u2019t work as well when you\u2019re trying to, for example, model an algorithm in a specific system. If you get too granular and too detailed, sequence diagrams become too much trouble than they\u2019re worth. But when you use them to map out different \u201cblack boxes\u201d and show how they talk to each other, they can be really helpful.But like other diagrams, sequence diagrams succeed in proportion to how well you make them. Their quality, however, isn\u2019t dependent on sheer effort but requires a careful, thoughtful approach based on starting from the core process and working outward toward the edge cases.Design sequence diagrams from the inside outThere are many reasons why you might want to make a sequence diagram, but no matter the inspiration, the best way to make a sequence diagram and solve the original problem is to start from the inside and work your way out and through.Start with the happy path and work to the edge casesWhen you sit down to create a sequence diagram, might be tempting to begin with the edge cases because the edge cases are often the most complex and the most in need of clarification.Often, it\u2019s the possibility of an edge case (if you\u2019re creating a sequence diagram to support architecture design) or an already present, already troublesome edge case (if you\u2019re creating a sequence diagram to better understand legacy software) that inspires the creation of a sequence design. But even if your primary goal is to clarify those edge cases, you\u2019ll create a better sequence diagram if you start from the happy path first.When you start, identify the happy path \u2013 the ideal way messages flow from beginning to end. Once you diagram this core sequence, you can work outward to other routes and more infrequent message flows.For example, using the banking application login example, it\u2019s best to start with the happy path \u2013 customers requesting access and the bank granting that access. Starting from this core flow ensures that as you think through and document divergent flows and edge cases, the happy path remains your anchor.From there, you can layer in more complexity to the happy path. In the below example, we\u2019ve added a few more components, including an authentication service and a database, but the core happy path remains central.Starting with the happy path provides clarity, ensuring that when you shift to the edge cases, you know how the sequence is supposed to run and know why a user might be encountering an edge case. Building up and out from the happy path is also the best way to avoid overcomplicating the final diagram.Comprehensibility > ComprehensivenessThe most common failure mode for sequence diagrams is over-complication. (This also is the failure mode for most diagrams, as I wrote in an article on flow charts).One of the best people to refer to here is Martin Fowler, who wrote (almost twenty years ago) that the primary value of drawing diagrams is communication. \u201cEffective communication,\u201d Fowler writes, \u201cmeans selecting important things and neglecting the less important.\u201dThe neglect is the tough part. Because the purpose of diagramming is communication, it\u2019s essential to strip away some information so as to clarify other information. Fowler reminds us that \u201cthe code is the best source of comprehensive information,\u201d so diagrams \u2013 by nature \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be comprehensive (that\u2019s what the code is for). Fowler puts it well, writing that \u201ccomprehensiveness is the enemy of comprehensibility.\u201dYou can see this well in the sequence diagram below, which a developer cited in a PR to request that the team \u201cconsider abstracting away less important information from the diagram so that the reading developer can focus on the important ideas.\u201dIn his article on the death of UML, Thomas Beale writes that the main reason UML became overly complex is that the creators tried to \u201cdefine a single meta-model\u201d that could provide all the elements necessary for over a dozen diagram types. Beale argues that \u201cEach type of diagram in fact represents a specific conceptual space, which needs its own specific model.\u201dUML itself died, in part, because it added complexity instead of providing clarity. This is useful to remember today because \u2013 just as UML died \u2013 so will any given sequence diagram fail if it gets overly complex.Big picture > DetailsIf the former problem is a result of being too comprehensive and too broad, the next problem is a result of being too detailed and too narrow.In Alex Bell\u2019s article on UML Fever, one of the many \u201cstrains\u201d he describes is \u201cGnat\u2019s eyebrow fever\u201d and it\u2019s one of the most likely problems to afflict your sequence diagrams. He describes this fever as the \u201cvery strong desire to create UML diagrams that are extremely detailed\u201d and argues it results from the belief that diagramming granular details \u201cincreases the probability that the resulting code will be more correct.\u201dImplementation is where the rubber meets the road, however, so if you\u2019re building a sequence diagram so as to better inform design requirements, there\u2019s a point in the process where it\u2019s more efficient to stop diagraming and start coding.That said, this principle extends beyond that use case. If you\u2019re building a sequence diagram to communicate a process in your documentation, for example, visualizing the big picture will be more useful for readers than digging deep into the details. It\u2019s not that the details are unimportant but that too many details will impair the ability to see the big picture sequence (which is the primary goal of sequence diagrams).The same principle applies to analyzing and documenting legacy code \u2013 the detail is in the code itself so the sequence diagram will only be useful if you use it to visualize the big picture.Embrace an architectural mindset with sequence diagramsThe point of this article isn\u2019t to look at sequence diagrams out of sheer historical curiosity. Sequence diagrams are not only an artifact of UML but an artifact of a software design mindset that emphasized rigorous designing and planning.Fowler explains that the association between diagrams and \u201cheavyweight\u201d processes is a result of diagramming poorly \u2013 not a result of diagramming itself. The advice throughout this article is meant to help you create better sequence diagrams but in the process, hopefully, help you better see the possibilities that result from having diagramming skills in your design and documentation arsenal.The best work comes from cycling between designing and coding \u2013 creating an upfront design, coding based on the design, and feeding what you learned from the coding work back into the design. If a diagram helps you understand a sequence, it\u2019s \u201cperfectly reasonable,\u201d as Fowler writes, to throw it away after. (\u201cThrowing it away,\u201d however, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean deleting it forever; it\u2019s often helpful to put it aside so that you can return to it later if, for example, you want to think through previous work).\u201cThe point,\u201d which Jacobson emphasizes in his article about the death of UML, \u201cis for every sprint to lead with architectural thinking.\u201d With sequence diagrams, in particular, you can better understand the processes at hand \u2013 making it easier to build or improve their components.AUTHORKnut SveidqvistCreator of MermaidJS and founder of Mermaid Chart\u2190subhash-halder contributed quadrant charts so you can show your manager what to select - just like the strategy consultants at BCG do8 June 2023",
    "summary": "- Sequence diagrams are a useful way to document how different parts of a system interact with each other.\n- They are a type of diagram that maps the flow of messages and operations within a system.\n- Sequence diagrams can be used to model simple processes, like logging in to a banking app, or more complex scenarios with conditional flows.\n- Despite the decline in popularity of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), sequence diagrams have remained valuable and widely used.\n- Sequence diagrams are especially valuable for sketching and designing systems, documenting system requirements, and understanding existing systems.\n- When creating a sequence diagram, it's important to start with the main flow (the \"happy path\") and then add complexity and edge cases.\n- The key to creating a good sequence diagram is to prioritize comprehensibility over comprehensiveness.\n- Sequence diagrams should focus on the big picture and the flow of messages, rather than excessive details.\n- By embracing an architectural mindset and using sequence diagrams, software engineers can improve their design and documentation skills.",

    "content": "Our plan for Python 3.13Author: Mark Shannon, Michael DroettboomOverviewThe plan for 3.13 is similar to early plans for 3.12.The big difference is that we have now finished the foundational work that we need:Low impact monitoring (PEP 669) is implemented.The bytecode compiler is a much better state.The interpreter generator is working.Experiments on the register machine are complete.We have a viable approach to create a low-overhead maintainable machine code generator, based on copy-and-patch.We plan three parallelizable pieces of work for 3.13:The tier 2 optimizerEnabling subinterpreters from Python code (PEP 554).Memory managementThe tier 2 optimizerSee Tier 2 optimizer for an explanation of what the tier2 optimizer is.The workplan is roughly as follows:Get the tier 2 interpreter workingGenerate (poor quality) superblocksImplement basic superblock managementIn parallel:Add support for deoptimization to superblocksEnhance the superblock creation codeImplement the specializerImplement the partial evaluatorImplement the copy-and-patch machine code generatorBuild-time integrationGeneration of tier 2 codeOur goal for 3.13 is to reduce the time spent in the interpreter by at least 50%.Detailed plan. Detailed plan for copy-and-patch.Enabling subinterpreters from PythonUnlike the other tasks, which are mainly focused on single-threaded performance, this work builds on the per-interpreter GIL work that shipped in Python 3.12 to allow Python programmers to take advantage of better parallelism in subinterpreters from Python code (without the need to write a C extension).A draft PEP 554 already exists for this work. The first step will be to get it updated and push for an early approval, so we can change course if necessary.Detailed plan.Better memory managementThe profiling data shows that quite a large amount of time spent is spent in memory management and cycle GC. That fraction will only get larger as we speed up the rest of the VM.Unlike the tasks above, we are less certain about the appropriate solutions, so some more research and experimentation is required first. We plan to do this as a side project based on what we learn from the Tier 2 work above.We want to:Do fewer allocations by improving data structures*Spend less time doing cycle GCs. This could be as simple as doing fewer collections, or as complex as implementing a new, incremental cycle finder.TODO: Create issues for investigationList our detailed strategy and workplan for improving allocation/deallocation speed and reducing cycle GC overhead.* We also hope that partial evaluation will reduce the number of temporary objects, but that is in the scope of the tier 2 optimizer, not memory management.",

Generally, I add things, with interesting stories to my collection. My oldest sword is privileged information but my favorite is the first one I got.In 1990 I was visiting Edinburgh on business for Sun, and I wanted a Claymore in celebration of my Scottish ancestry. At the Haymarket, I met an antique salesperson who let me in on the sad truth that a \"real\" one would set me back $40,000+ in 1990 dollars. But he mentioned that the British Museum sometimes sold \"extras\", swords which weren't particularly significant or not something they were going to add to the collection but selling them raised funds to cover costs. And he gave me the number of a curator of the Arms and Armor section of the museum.I called and spoke to the curator who told me that no, they didn't have, nor would they sell me a sword from their collection, but they did do business with a swordsmith in Whitburn who they sometimes used to make copies of swords in their collection so that they could display the copy and preserve the original. This smith had worked with them for years and made a point about re-creating the original process as closely as possible. The curator gave me contact information for the swordsmith[1].I called the swordsmith and explained to him what I was trying to accomplish and he understood right away but explained that it would be expensive. Making these copies often took months to make. I told him that was okay and asked what he would charge me, his answer was 1,500 pounds[2], 750 up front and 750 on completion. He had a sword he was making for the museum and it would make a good template for the one he would make me. I agreed to his terms and across a bunch of timezones on two different continents managed to arrange a wire transfer to his account for the 750 pounds.I returned from Scotland and told my wife the whole thing and she was skeptical and thought I had burned up $2,000 on a silly idea. About five and a half months letter I get a telegram (yes, honest to goodness \"YOUR SWORD IS READY STOP SEND BALANCE STOP ...\" etc kind of thing. I called him on the phone and he agreed to make a crate for it and to ship it via counter to counter service of British Airlines (they had a couple of different non-stop flights to SFO). We had a discussion about customs and duties and whether or not I wanted the sword tempered as it would have been in the 15th century, or not. The plan was to not temper it, making it somewhat useless as a \"real\" sword, and declaring it as a \"Work of art, made of metal\" (no duty required). He gave me the flight number they would ship it on and I wired him the rest of the funds.A few days later I went to SFO to pick it up, inquired at the BA desk and they redirected me to customs. I went to customs and they said, \"This isn't a work of art, this is a sword. You owe 10% duty on it.\" I tried to explain to them that the Venus de Milo was just some pottery with no arms but they were having none of it. They stuck firm and asked what I paid for it.

The theory they put forward as to one of the reasons the big successful Bronze age civilizations got out-competed is that bronze is very expensive / hard to acquire, primarily because of the need for tin. (Copper is very common but unsuitable for weaponry without turning it into bronze.)Iron is extremely common and cheap, but requires much much higher temperatures to work with than bronze. Once the furnace technology was out there to make smelting iron and creation of steel feasible, poorer / less complicated civilizations were able to make iron weaponry and go up against their richer neighbors.replyGravitasFailure 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Bronze is superior to iron, but not to steel. Both bronze and steel can take very sharp edges while only steel can be tempered to be springy and tough and therefore can make much lighter weapons. Iron is soft, weak, prone to rusting, can't easily take or hold an edge, and requires a lot of fuel to process from ore, but you can get it anywhere in large quantities if you have the fuel, while bronze needs the much harder to find tin.replycredit_guy 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think they are comparable. A blow from a bronze sword will kill you just as well as a blow from an iron sword. The most widespread weapon of all times prior to the American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic wars were spears. A spear with a bronze tip and one with an iron tip will also kill you with equal probability. If you have a shield, the damage to the spear is much more likely to come from a broken shaft than from a cracked tip. The shield itself generally had a metallic part (a \"boss\") that could be made of bronze or iron. Both were equally effective.Swords were generally not used in battle. But if used, a bronze sword was a bit more likely to crack than an iron sword. Bronze weapons were resistant to corrosion though. So that meant they did a better job in their secondary role: that of provider of status. A warrior with shiny armor, shield and sword is much more imposing and frightening than one with a rusty armor, shield and sword. Of course, in the bronze age, war was more ritualistic than war during the Roman empire, when war was much more like an industrial operation. For the purposes of the Roman empire, iron was probably doing a better job than bronze.replyplewd 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]What were swords used for if not for battle?replycredit_guy 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]People often compare sword with handguns. Handguns nowadays are deadly weapons, but they are not used in war, where people use assault rifles instead, or other heavier weapons. Swords were sidearms. Warriors carried them around every day, they could be used for self defense (in those times there was not police or law enforcement). Or they could be used for intimidating opponents, and if needed, for chopping someone's head or limb.In combat though, spears were much, much more effective.With one exception. As far as I can tell only one exception, but a big one. The Romans have figured out that all other people are quite bad at close quarters combat. Since soldiers were used to using spears, very few soldiers knew what to do if someone got in a close range than the length of a spear. The Romans then would bull-rush the enemy using their shield, and when close they would use their (quite short) swords. Without training, their opponents didn't stand a chance. Of course, this type of battle tactic required an enormous amount of training. The Romans did that because they were a very war-oriented society. Others couldn't match their level of training.Even for the Romans though, who were regularly using swords, the choice of bronze versus iron would have made little difference. Although bronze is a bit more brittle than iron, and a bronze sword is more likely to break when it strikes a hard object, the Romans were trained to thrust the sword, not to use slashing moves. Thrusting is much more deadly, but less instinctive. It's another thing that requires extensive training, which the Romans were great at. For thrusting, I think a bronze and an iron sword do equally well.replylenkite 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Nice explanation, but the Romans did use spears - the 7-foot heavy pilum.

Poor quality iron is often inferior, but of course actual steel is much better. Bronze can take a great edge but is a a bit softer and can get edge damage in battle/usage quicker. However bronze does have one big benefit over iron/steel, repairability. If a bronze item is damaged it can be cold worked and annealed repeatedly over a simple wood fire. With iron or steel you need a more proper forge and charcoal to repair it and it has to be worked while hot which requires more tools on hand to do properly.

The Eastern empire was a little different, but Western Europe was pretty much fubar in the early middle ages.Although technology steadily progressed throughout the middle ages, it took centuries for population and social organization to return to anywhere near classical levels. If you lived during the early middle age, it was an unmistakable fact that a great \"precursor civilization\" capable of wonders far beyond what your own civilization was capable of had lived and fallen long before you were born.

Hitting another sword with it would be exhausting and painful.replyadrian_b 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I doubt that \"shock absorption\" would have been a problem.This kind of sword would not have been used like a hammer.The wavy pattern on the bronze handle would have ensured a firm grip even with a sweaty or wet hand. I have some Japanese Tojiro kitchen knives, which have stainless steel handles with a similar pattern on the handle, and they are more comfortable than most of the knife handles made of wood or plastic, especially when used with a dirty hand.So based on this experience, I do not believe that such a bronze handle would have been a serious disadvantage, even if it is possible that the sword was purely ceremonial.replybee_rider 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I have found though that my kitchen knife is not very good when I have to parry, or when I have to bash my way through a shield.replyadrian_b 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Nobody would have parried with a sword, except in desperate situations, because of the risk of breaking the sword or damaging its edge. That's what the shield was for.However you have a valid point that anyone wielding a sword had to resist the shock of a successful parry with the shield done by the opponent.For thrusting movements, I do not believe that such a bronze handle would have been worse than any other handle, because it is unlikely to have been more slippery.Only for cutting movements you are right that a handle wrapped in leather or cords should have been better at absorbing shocks.replycivilitty 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The reason I bring it up is a (minuscule) amount of personal experience: I've had the chance to practice/play fight with a replica bronze sword & shield against an opponent. We were expressly forbidden from parrying with the swords and it surprised me just how physically demanding the parries were against the shield, largely I think due to the ringing. Regaining control after the impact of the sword was hard.That said, the craftsmanship of the sword I used was nothing like the one in the TFA and it didn't have a handle cast onto the blade, nor such an intricate design. I don't know how accurate the shield were to the time period (one was leather bound, the tower shield was not) but they didn't have metal rims and shield bosses.replyGeorge83728 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]If the blade breaks, that handle is fancy enough that somebody might want it fitted with a new blade.replytechwiz137 14 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]The shape, intricate detail, not something I would have expected from a civilization 3000 years ago.

Pure iron is very soft and ductile.

    "content": "On the Slow Productivity of John WickJune 13, 2023I found myself recently, as one does, watching the mini-documentary featurettes included on the DVD for the popular 2014 Keanu Reeves movie, John Wick \u2014 an enjoyably self-aware neon noir revenge-o-matic, filmed cinematically on anamorphic lenses.At the core of John Wick\u2018s success are the action sequences. The movie\u2019s director, Chad Stahelski, is a former stuntman who played Reeve\u2019s double in The Matrix trilogy and subsequently made a name for himself as a second unit director specializing in filming fights. When Reeves asked Stahelski to helm Wick, he had exactly this experience in mind. Stahelski rose to the challenge, making the ambitious choice to feature a visually-arresting blend of judo, jiu-jitsu, and tactical 3-gun shooting. In contrast to the hand-held, chaotic, quick-cutting style that defines the Bourne and Taken franchises, Stahelski decided to capture his sequences in long takes that emphasized the balletic precision of the fighting.The problem with this plan, of course, is that it required Keanu Reeves to become sufficiently good at judo, jiu-jitsu, and tactical 3-gun shooting so as not to look clumsy for Stahelski\u2019s stable camera. Reeves was game. According to the featurette I watched, to prepare for production, he trained eight hours a day, four months in a row. The effort paid off. The action set pieces in the movie were show-stopping, and after initially struggling to find a distributor, the film, made on a modest budget, went on to earn $86 million, kicking off a franchise that has since brought in hundreds of millions more.What struck me as I watched this behind-the-scenes feature is how differently creatives who work in the arts think about productivity as compared to creatives who work in office jobs. For Keanu Reeves, it was obvious that the most productive path was to focus all of his attention on a single goal: becoming really good at Stahelski\u2019s innovative brand of gun fu. Doing this, and basically only this, month after month, materialized hundreds of millions of dollar of profit out of the entertainment ether.In office jobs, by contrast, productivity remains rooted in notions of busyness and multi-faceted activity. The most productive knowledge workers are those who stay on top of their inboxes and somehow juggle the dozens of obligations, from the small tasks to major projects, hurled in their direction every week. Movie-making is of course different than, say, being a marketing executive, or professor, or project manager, but creating things that are too good to be ignored, regardless of the setting, is an activity that almost without exception requires undivided attention. Are we so sure that the definition of \u201cproductive\u201d that defines knowledge work really is the most profitable use of our talents?John Wick may be shallow entertainment, but the story of its success highlights some deep lessons about what the rest of us might be missing in our pursuit of a job well done.Receive Cal's Essays Directly In Your InboxSubscribeWe respect your privacy.

    "content": "11 years of hosting a SaaSLots of mistakes, some uptime too.ALEX GHICULESCUJUN 14, 2023131Tanda will be turning 11 pretty soon. A reader suggested it would be fun to reflect on things I\u2019ve learned in running the app on the internet during that time.I sat on this post for ages because deployment, hosting, and infrastructure management in general was possibly the most challenging and frustrating part of my job for a decade. Mostly that\u2019s because I constantly dove into the deep end and didn\u2019t know what I was doing a lot of the time. Unfortunately when you have a production app that lots of people use, you don\u2019t always have the time to learn things properly.This post is the story of some of the phases we went through, written in the hope if you see yourself on the same path you can skip a few of the worst bits.Phase 1: HerokuWe started on Heroku, because in 2012 if you did any Ruby on Rails tutorial that included deploying your app, you ended up with a Heroku account.Heroku\u2019s ease of use was unparalleled. But this didn\u2019t mean much to somebody who\u2019d never deployed a web app before. I knew that internet guide authors thought it was the simplest way to deploy an app, but I didn\u2019t understand how big an improvement it was over what came before it.1What I did understand were its weaknesses:PrescriptivenessCostsPrescriptiveness: Heroku worked very well, as long you used it exactly as intended. We were pretty close to this; a web app with a database, some background workers, and a cache.For us there was one slight difference, which is that our app needed to occasionally handle long requests (file uploads) from slow clients (phones or tablets running in places with bad signal). We didn\u2019t pioneer mobile file uploads, but the right way to configure Unicorn to handle them was just different enough from the defaults that it caused me a lot of grief.2 Because I knew nothing about deploying web applications, I decided this was Heroku\u2019s fault.These days I know a little better and can appreciate the complexity of what they were trying to do, but I doubt I was the only person to take their elevator pitch of being everything you need to deploy an app a bit too literally.Costs: Heroku cost a lot more than alternatives like running your own VPS. Of course - it did a lot more! But because this was my first time deploying anything myself I didn\u2019t appreciate the second part of that, and just saw dollar signs when comparing it to alternatives.I imagine this is similar to the experience of newcomers to Rails today, vs those who discovered it (as DHH did) after coming from Java or something else in the bad old days. Your appreciation of how much better this is than what used to be there will not be the same. Luckily, these days you could easily get that same appreciation by trying to build a full stack Javascript app and then coming back to Rails.Anyway, cost is what eventually led to us migrating off Heroku. Our last Heroku invoice was\u2026 $104.95. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0fPhase 2: Digital OceanAbout a year into Tanda I had an intern from my university who was super interested in infrastructure and cost optimisation. He basically convinced me that paying for Heroku was like setting money on fire. He was a lovely guy, and I really appreciated his help at the time, but 10 years later I can honestly say this was awful advice (the buck stops with me for listening to it).Moving off Heroku meant replacing all the bits that Heroku did. We didn\u2019t do it in a fully automated way, because we were sub-scale! We were so small, there would be no point. Instead, we just point and clicked a servers in Digital Ocean\u2019s UI. Then we set up some Capistrano scripts to deploy to them. Over a weekend, we took the site offline for some ridiculously short period of time, downloaded the database from Heroku, uploaded it to a Digital Ocean \u201cdroplet\u201d (aka server), and changed the DNS records. We had migrated over!Our first Digital Ocean invoice was for $28.93, and our second (the first full month) was for $39.23. I thought I was so smart saving $2 a day. For a while it worked okay; it turns out $40/month bought a lot more servers than we actually needed to run our very small app.The cracks started to show when we started to grow faster. We were doubling the size of our customer base every 9 months, and pretty soon this meant we needed more servers. The process of adding them was manual, finicky, and easy to get wrong. I worked out how to do it but I always had a bad feeling in my stomach when adding extra \u201chardware\u201d.The cracks really started to show when our database server started getting overloaded. Pretty consistently if we didn\u2019t deploy the site for more than a day, Postgres would run out of memory and get killed by the operating system. Sometimes it would fix itself, but more often it would require someone to SSH into app servers and restart them all. This was an annoying part of the workday during the business hours, but I have more than a few memories of restarting servers on my phone from the toilets of bars during this time.3But the worst Digital Ocean incident we ever had was when they turned all our droplets off all at once. The credit card entered into the account had expired, there was no way to enter a backup card, and the contact email on the account went to a shared inbox that was not monitored. So for probably a month we were getting and ignoring billing alerts, until we really paid attention when everything was offline and not responding to SSH. This wasn\u2019t totally their fault, but at the time it just all felt like a dodgy, shaky setup.Writing all this nearly 10 years later feels very cringe, it\u2019s shocking how little we knew and a bit of a miracle we got away with it. If I had a time machine I\u2019d go back and tell myself to spend 10x more on Digital Ocean ($500/month really wouldn\u2019t have broken the bank) and sleep properly.After about 3 years on Digital Ocean, we decided that the platform was too simple for our growing needs. We were starting to sign bigger customers on, and we thought we needed a more enterprisey approach to hosting our app. We wanted a managed database instead of managing our own Postgres our own server. We wanted less platform downtime.4 We needed to be able to autoscale in response to fluctuations in demand, and we needed to be able to load balance different routes to different groups of resources (\u2026 of our monorepo). We thought we needed all these things to be legitimate.In hindsight, most of this logic was backwards. Auto scaling is a technique, not a product monopolised by AWS. Instead of seeking more challenges, we should have found a platform that was simple enough that we could actually master it. (The managed database thing was a good idea though.)The only reasonable reason to move off DO was that they didn\u2019t have an Australian data center, and we had some customers that really cared about that. At the time it was just around the corner; it launched in late 2022. So it\u2019s good we didn\u2019t wait for that.Anyway. We needed to level up. And if you want to level up your hosting, who you gonna call?Phase 3: AWSWe needed to be a real business, and real businesses hosted their apps on AWS. So that\u2019s what we did. Specifically, we ported our exact Digital Ocean infrastructure onto AWS EC2. We didn\u2019t take advantage of any other platform features, we just treated AWS like any other VPS.A few months later I learned that we were entitled to an AWS account manager. I learned this from a customer, who also did an intro. I was pretty excited - I thought an account manager would be able to help us grow very quickly and get to a nirvana where we didn\u2019t have constant fear about scaling.At our first meeting our account manager brought along his solutions architect. I had never met a solutions architect, so I didn\u2019t really know what they did. All this guy did was answer every question we asked about anything with \u201chow would that work in a world without servers?\u201d. I didn\u2019t really understand how AWS Lambda would help us (still don\u2019t) but he didn\u2019t have anything useful to contribute except for reminding us it existed.5 I had been so excited about having an account manager, so for a while I felt dumb for not understanding Lambda and not being smart enough to make AWS work. Eventually I realised that I wasn\u2019t the problem.Another fun incident about a year later was that we ran out of integers. Our Rails app was pretty old, and almost every table used integer as its primary key type. Newer versions of Rails created new tables as bigints, but nobody in our team realised this was a problem until one Friday (you can\u2019t make this stuff up - it was Friday the 13th!) we couldn\u2019t insert any new rows into the mostly commonly written table. Luckily everyone was still at the office drinking, so we were able to respond to the incident pretty quickly. This story really resonates.This incident prompted us to put a lot more effort into monitoring so we could respond more quickly when things break (this was a silver lining). It also gave me a lifelong paranoia about other hidden gotchas in PostgreSQL that I have never been able to fully shake (I\u2019m not sure if this was a silver lining).In more recent times, major projects in AWS land have mostly been compliance related things. Making sure we tick every box for GDRP and equivalents in other countries led to getting SOC-2 certified. For all these things, being able to point to the Amazon logo made things a little bit easier, but it\u2019s not the case that anything we wanted to do was made possible or impossible by being on a specific cloud.A few years into AWS we started to feel stable on it, infrastructure wise. We hadn\u2019t architectured our stack for a while, and we didn\u2019t see a big need to - two big achievements! The next major challenge we faced was institutional knowledge, or lack thereof. Over Tanda\u2019s history, less than 10 people had worked in \u201cDevOps\u201d (very broadly defined). But people come and go. 2 were around at the moment, 1 was finishing up soon, so the idea of having only a single Site Reliability Engineer in the team was not very appealing.Not that the SREs were working entirely alone. We\u2019d had an oncall rotation for engineers for a while too, but we weren\u2019t very good at training people on tricky parts of the stack beyond the Rails app. So oncall folks spent a lot of time acknowledging alerts and monitoring them, but only on a few occasions did they successfully get in the weeds and fix issues or improve systems significantly.Basically, the system was being held together by string and random bursts of individual brilliance. That\u2019s a bad long term strategy. We needed a proper team structure so that we never depended on one person being able to debug any issue.Phase 4: Platform Infrastructure Team (PIT)To do this, about a year ago we created a Platform Infrastructure Team, reporting to the CTO. The team had several people in every time zone so we had 24 hour coverage for Ops, Infrastructure, and related work.This was a big highlight personally - I finally stopped being on call!It also was the first time I really felt like we had a team that was building expertise. After a decade of worrying we didn\u2019t know enough, having things break in embarrassing ways, and changing platforms a lot, it felt great to have a roadmap to stability and professionalism.The first thing the PIT did was end a bunch of half-done ongoing infrastructure projects and trim as much unused infrastructure as possible. Between that and documenting the oncall process properly they got rid of a lot complexity very quickly. This made everyone in the team more productive right away, and also gave them ownership over the system.The official Platform Infrastructure Team hat, on the head of our CTO, Leon.It\u2019s still a work in progress, because building expertise in complex domains takes a long time. But for the first time ever I\u2019m really confident in the team, and really proud of what they\u2019ve achieved in a year.By the way, we\u2019re still on AWS, but this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want to change platform ever again. It\u2019s always good to explore what\u2019s out there, and we\u2019ve spent a bit of time learning more about moving off the cloud to a managed data center. But the nice thing is not feeling like we need to.If I had a time machineIf I had a time machine to go back to 2012 and give myself a few pointers, what would I say?Lots of little tips, and three big ones. Both boil down to spending a bit more money, to avoid a lot of headaches.Use managed services for as long as possible. We did ourselves a big disservice by leaving Heroku after only a few months. We should have stayed on it for years - there was so much time wasted managing servers that could have been done for us during critical early days.Set up a PIT sooner. I should have set up a team of professionals who wanted to work in this space much much earlier. Not in the Heroku days, but once it became untenable as we hit real scale.Look after yourself just a bit more. For some reason I always found it really hard to prioritise projects that would decrease alerts, simplify oncall, or help me get more sleep. Until suddenly one day I snapped and reallocated a lot of budget to set up the PIT team. Getting decent sleep has many commercial benefits and it\u2019s not selfish to prioritise that over other things the team could work on.Thanks to Austin and Dave for reading drafts of this. Bigger thanks to those two, and to everyone else who\u2019s worked on keeping us online and clocking over the years. I only take credit for the stuff we got wrong.1I think products like Twilio and Stripe face a similar challenge as we head into less frothy economic times.2For the exact details on what went wrong, you can read Heroku\u2019s guide to Deploying Unicorn, specifically the Slow Clients section. That section appeared some time after I had a call with a Heroku support engineer about our issues. I ended up replacing Unicorn with Puma.3Eventually I came across an issue with prepared statements on Rails 4.2 which seemed to cause exactly the issue we had. Here is a blast from the past. I slept well that night!4At the time we thought DO was really unstable and constantly taking us offline while they did maintenance things. That was true sometimes, but these days I\u2019m not so sure it wasn\u2019t us being a bit incompetent too.5By the way, most people I know still use servers.131",
