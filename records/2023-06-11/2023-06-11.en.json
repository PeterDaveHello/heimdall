    "content": "Theodore J. Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who attacked academics, businessmen, and random civilians with homemade bombs from 1978 to 1995, has died at the age of 81 in a federal prison medical center in Butner, N.C. He was found unresponsive in his cell early in the morning, and it is believed that he died by suicide. Mr. Kaczynski was solitary, and his manifesto, published by The New York Times and The Washington Post in 1995, argued that the organization of society gave politicians, corporation executives, and remote anonymous technicians and bureaucrats control over the life-and-death issues of one\u2019s existence. His manifesto pointed out the damage that could subsequently occur to the environment and shown how the alienating effects of technology were so heinous that the social and industrial underpinnings of modern life should be destroyed. Mr. Kaczynski\u2019s manifesto has suffered a divided opinion as it depicted the use of violence to support his message to the public about technology and its impact on the environment, which appealed to the progressive faction of the community while others saw him as just a psychopath seeking to justify his sadism.- Young people online have developed an ironic appreciation for Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, referring to themselves as \"anti-civ\" or #tedpilled and making videos on TikTok.\n- Kaczynski's crimes are in the past and he is no longer an active threat to society.\n- His papers, which he copied by hand while in prison, have become popular at the University of Michigan's Joseph A. Labadie Collection.\n- Kaczynski's online support indicates a prevalence of cynicism, boredom, dissatisfaction with modern life, and gloom about its prospects for change among young people.\n- A correction was made regarding the surname of a Norwegian mass murderer who lifted passages from Kaczynski's manifesto.",

    "hn_content": "The Tech Times reports the death of Ted Kaczynski, infamous as the \u201cUnabomber\u201d who mailed bombs to academics and technologists; although he was also a talented mathematician with a doctorate from the University of Michigan. Kaczynski despised modern technology and left behind a manifesto explaining his reasons, which was published by the\u00a0New York Times. While some argue\u00a0that Kaczynski had valid points about over-reliance on technology\u00a0as was reflected in \"Industrial Society and Its Future\" - the ideas that drove him to commit\u00a0murder have no place in civilised discourse. Kaczynski had been serving a life sentence for his crimes since 1998.The text is a series of off-topic comments and replies related to the Unabomber and his ideology. It does not contain any meaningful content related to cutting-edge technology news or advancements.Comments on a forum discussing the ideas of Ted Kaczynski, the \"Unabomber,\" are varied. While some criticize his use of violence, others find his critiques of industrial society and technology thought-provoking. Some dispute Kaczynski's proposed solutions, such as returning to a primitive state, and suggest focusing instead on better ways to apply technology. Many acknowledge the ethical dilemma of considering the ideas of someone who committed violent acts, but argue that it is possible to separate the work from the author. Overall, the comments reflect a range of opinions on the legacy of Kaczynski and the relevance of his ideas in today's society.A discussion on a post analyzing the difficulty of achieving different values in modern versus tribal societies. The post breaks down famous philosophical values and traditions such as pleasure, community, and knowledge and examines how they would be affected by survival pressures in a tribal society. The comment section moves on to discuss the manifesto of Ted Kaczynski and its critique of society's reliance on technology. While controversial, the discussion around Kaczynski's ideas and how they relate to current societal issues is interesting and thought-provoking.There is a debate about the coherence of Ted Kaczynski's writing, with some praising it while others finding it lacking. Kaczynski's manifesto gives his views on leftism, which he believes causes factionalism and alienation within society. His ideas include opposition to affirmative action, gun control, and social planning. The manifesto was crucial in identifying Kaczynski as the Unabomber, who was responsible for a series of bombings. Some argue that the advancement of technology has potential negative consequences, and that change through consensus is the only way for long-term success. There are better thought-leaders to read beyond Kaczynski, and pacifism and non-violence are ideals that governments use to maintain power. Violence and threats of violence are viewed as effective means of motivation.A discussion thread on HN covers various aspects of technology, society, and human evolution mentioned in Ted Kaczynski's manifesto. Key points covered in the thread include views on the impact of technology on human lives, the potential control of machines over humanity, the psychological impact of excessive preoccupation with modern distractions, and the role of nostalgia in shaping ideologies. One commenter finds that the manifesto is written with reasonable coherence and that some of Kaczynski's ideas align with the present state of technology, especially as regards AI. Other contributors, however, suggest problems with Kaczynski's analysis and argue that progress is essential for human advancement, but can be managed in ways that benefit people and society at large.",

    "content": "BlogMicronewsPlanetlatest news / news from 2023 / news -- debian 12 bookworm releasedDebian 12 bookworm releasedJune 10th, 2023After 1 year, 9 months, and 28 days of development, the Debian project is proud to present its new stable version 12 (code name bookworm).bookworm will be supported for the next 5 years thanks to the combined work of the Debian Security team and the Debian Long Term Support team.Following the 2022 General Resolution about non-free firmware, we have introduced a new archive area making it possible to separate non-free firmware from the other non-free packages:non-free-firmwareMost non-free firmware packages have been moved from non-free to non-free-firmware. This separation makes it possible to build a variety of official installation images.Debian 12 bookworm ships with several desktop environments, such as:Gnome 43,KDE Plasma 5.27,LXDE 11,LXQt 1.2.0,MATE 1.26,Xfce 4.18This release contains over 11,089 new packages for a total count of 64,419 packages, while over 6,296 packages have been removed as obsolete. 43,254 packages were updated in this release. The overall disk usage for bookworm is 365,016,420 kB (365 GB), and is made up of 1,341,564,204 lines of code.bookworm has more translated man pages than ever thanks to our translators who have made man-pages available in multiple languages such as: Czech, Danish, Greek, Finnish, Indonesian, Macedonian, Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l), Russian, Serbian, Swedish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese. All of the systemd man pages are now completely available in German.The Debian Med Blend introduces a new package: shiny-server which simplifies scientific web applications using R. We have kept to our efforts of providing Continuous Integration support for Debian Med team packages. Install the metapackages at version 3.8.x for Debian bookworm.The Debian Astro Blend continues to provide a one-stop solution for professional astronomers, enthusiasts, and hobbyists with updates to almost all versions of the software packages in the blend. astap and planetary-system-stacker help with image stacking and astrometry resolution. openvlbi, the open source correlator, is now included.Support for Secure Boot on ARM64 has been reintroduced: users of UEFI-capable ARM64 hardware can boot with Secure Boot mode enabled to take full advantage of the security feature.Debian 12 bookworm includes numerous updated software packages (over 67% of all packages from the previous release), such as:Apache 2.4.57BIND DNS Server 9.18Cryptsetup 2.6Dovecot MTA 2.3.19Emacs 28.2Exim (default email server) 4.96GIMP 2.10.34GNU Compiler Collection 12.2GnuPG 2.2.40Inkscape 1.2.2The GNU C Library 2.36lighthttpd 1.4.69LibreOffice 7.4Linux kernel 6.1 seriesLLVM/Clang toolchain 13.0.1, 14.0 (default), and 15.0.6MariaDB 10.11Nginx 1.22OpenJDK 17OpenLDAP 2.5.13OpenSSH 9.2p1Perl 5.36PHP 8.2Postfix MTA 3.7PostgreSQL 15Python 3, 3.11.2Rustc 1.63Samba 4.17systemd 252Vim 9.0With this broad selection of packages and its traditional wide architecture support, Debian once again stays true to its goal of being The Universal Operating System. It is suitable for many different use cases: from desktop systems to netbooks; from development servers to cluster systems; and for database, web, and storage servers. At the same time, additional quality assurance efforts like automatic installation and upgrade tests for all packages in Debian's archive ensure that bookworm fulfills the high expectations that users have of a stable Debian release.A total of nine architectures are officially supported for bookworm:32-bit PC (i386) and 64-bit PC (amd64),64-bit ARM (arm64),ARM EABI (armel),ARMv7 (EABI hard-float ABI, armhf),little-endian MIPS (mipsel),64-bit little-endian MIPS (mips64el),64-bit little-endian PowerPC (ppc64el),IBM System z (s390x)32-bit PC (i386) no longer covers any i586 processor; the new minimum processor requirement is i686. If your machine is not compatible with this requirement, it is recommended that you stay with bullseye for the remainder of its support cycle.The Debian Cloud team publishes bookworm for several cloud computing services:Amazon EC2 (amd64 and arm64),Microsoft Azure (amd64),OpenStack (generic) (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),GenericCloud (arm64, amd64),NoCloud (amd64, arm64, ppc64el)The genericcloud image should be able to run in any virtualised environment, and there is also a nocloud image which is useful for testing the build process.GRUB packages will by default no longer run os-prober for other operating systems.Between releases, the Technical Committee resolved that Debian bookworm should support only the merged-usr root filesystem layout, dropping support for the non-merged-usr layout. For systems installed as buster or bullseye there will be no changes to the filesystem; however, systems using the older layout will be converted during the upgrade.Want to give it a try?If you simply want to try Debian 12 bookworm without installing it, you can use one of the available live images which load and run the complete operating system in a read-only state via your computer's memory.These live images are provided for the amd64 and i386 architectures and are available for DVDs, USB sticks, and netboot setups. The user can choose among different desktop environments to try: GNOME, KDE Plasma, LXDE, LXQt, MATE, and Xfce. Debian Live bookworm has a standard live image, so it is also possible to try a base Debian system without any of the graphical user interfaces.Should you enjoy the operating system you have the option of installing from the live image onto your computer's hard disk. The live image includes the Calamares independent installer as well as the standard Debian Installer. More information is available in the release notes and the live install images sections of the Debian website.To install Debian 12 bookworm directly onto your computer's storage device you can choose from a variety of installation media types to Download such as: Blu-ray Disc, DVD, CD, USB stick, or via a network connection. See the Installation Guide for more details.Debian can now be installed in 78 languages, with most of them available in both text-based and graphical user interfaces.The installation images may be downloaded right now via bittorrent (the recommended method), jigdo, or HTTP; see Debian on CDs for further information. bookworm will soon be available on physical DVD, CD-ROM, and Blu-ray Discs from numerous vendors too.Upgrading DebianUpgrades to Debian 12 bookworm from the previous release, Debian 11 bullseye, are automatically handled by the APT package management tool for most configurations.Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that you make a full backup, or at least back up any data or configuration information you can't afford to lose. The upgrade tools and process are quite reliable, but a hardware failure in the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely damaged system. The main things you'll want to back up are the contents of /etc, /var/lib/dpkg, /var/lib/apt/extended_states and the output of: $ dpkg --get-selections '*' # (the quotes are important)We welcome any information from users related to the upgrade from bullseye to bookworm. Please share information by filing a bug in the Debian bug tracking system using the upgrade-reports package with your results.There has been a lot of development to the Debian Installer resulting in improved hardware support and other features such as fixes to graphical support on UTM, fixes to the GRUB font loader, removing the long wait at the end of the installation process, and fixes to the detection of BIOS-bootable systems. This version of the Debian Installer may enable non-free-firmware where needed.The ntp package has been replaced with the ntpsec package, with the default system clock service now being systemd-timesyncd; there is also support for chrony and openntpd.As non-free firmware has been moved to its own component in the archive, if you have non-free firmware installed it is recommended to add non-free-firmware to your APT sources-list.It is advisable to remove bullseye-backports entries from APT source-list files before the upgrade; after the upgrade consider adding bookworm-backports.For bookworm, the security suite is named bookworm-security; users should adapt their APT source-list files accordingly when upgrading. If your APT configuration also involves pinning or APT::Default-Release, it is likely to require adjustments to allow the upgrade of packages to the new stable release. Please consider disabling APT pinning.The OpenLDAP 2.5 upgrade includes some incompatible changes which may require manual intervention. Depending on configuration the slapd service may remain stopped after the upgrade until new configuration updates are completed.The new systemd-resolved package will not be installed automatically on upgrades as it has been split into a separate package. If using the systemd-resolved system service, please install the new package manually after the upgrade, and note that until it has been installed, DNS resolution may no longer work as the service will not be present on the system.There are some changes to system logging; the rsyslog package is no longer needed on most systems, and is not installed by default. Users may change to journalctl or use the new high precision timestamps that rsyslog now uses.Possible issues during the upgrade include Conflicts or Pre-Depends loops which can be solved by removing and eliminating some packages or forcing the re-installation of other packages. Additional concerns are Could not perform immediate configuration ... errors for which one will need to keep both bullseye (that was just removed) and bookworm (that was just added) in the APT source-list file, and File Conflicts which may require one to forcibly remove packages. As mentioned, backing the system up is the key to a smooth upgrade should any untoward errors occur.There are some packages where Debian cannot promise to provide minimal backports for security issues. Please see the Limitations in security support.As always, Debian systems may be upgraded painlessly, in place, without any forced downtime, but it is strongly recommended to read the release notes as well as the installation guide for possible issues, and for detailed instructions on installing and upgrading. The release notes will be further improved and translated to additional languages in the weeks after the release.About DebianDebian is a free operating system, developed by thousands of volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the Internet. The Debian project's key strengths are its volunteer base, its dedication to the Debian Social Contract and Free Software, and its commitment to provide the best operating system possible.

    "hn_content": "Debian 12 \"Bookworm\" was released featuring notable changes such as the inclusion of non-free firmware by default in the official install image for the first time, as a result of a voting process. Users can install Debian without any non-free software as installation of non-free firmware can be disabled. The inclusion of proprietary blobs was seen as a necessary compromise for the sake of hardware support. Although Debian was once considered a purist distribution, it has since maintained a non-free section in the archive of its distribution. The decision to include non-free firmware was a practical move designed to ensure the ease of use for Debian users. Debian is one of the biggest \"root\" distributions, and the template of numerous big and small derivates, so this release would have a potentially significant downstream impact. RISC-V was not added as a supported architecture in Debian 12.Debian's recent vote to support the use of proprietary firmware blobs on Debian may have disappointed some in the open-source community, but the vote highlights the ongoing debate about the importance of open hardware. Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation, argues that firmware that can be changed by the manufacturer after purchase is a threat to user freedom, while others, including many in the Debian community, see the inclusion of proprietary firmware blobs as necessary to enable the use of popular hardware.

    "content": "MusicGen: Simple and Controllable Music GenerationAbstractWe tackle the task of conditional music generation. We introduce MusicGen, a single Language Model (LM) that operates over several streams of compressed discrete music representation, i.e., tokens. Unlike prior work, MusicGen is comprised of a single-stage transformer LM together with efficient token interleaving patterns, which eliminates the need for cascading several models, e.g., hierarchically or upsampling. Following this approach, we demonstrate how MusicGen can generate high-quality samples, while being conditioned on textual description or melodic features, allowing better controls over the generated output. We conduct extensive empirical evaluation, considering both automatic and human studies, showing the proposed approach is superior to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark. Through ablation studies, we shed light over the importance of each of the components comprising MusicGen. Music samples can be found on the supplemental materials. Code and models are available on our repo github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft.Check out our a paper on Simple and Controllable Music Generation for more information.Samples: comparison to prior workIn the following, we compare MusicGen 3.3B to a number of prior work detailed in the paper: MusicLM, using the public AI Test Kitchen demo, Riffusion using the provided pre-trained modes, and Mousai, which we retrained on the same dataset as our proposed MusicGen model.desc MusicGen MusicLM Riffusion MusaiPop dance track with catchy melodies, tropical percussion, and upbeat rhythms, perfect for the beachA grand orchestral arrangement with thunderous percussion, epic brass fanfares, and soaring strings, creating a cinematic atmosphere fit for a heroic battle.classic reggae track with an electronic guitar soloearthy tones, environmentally conscious, ukulele-infused, harmonic, breezy, easygoing, organic instrumentation, gentle grooveslofi slow bpm electro chill with organic samplesdrum and bass beat with intense percussionsA dynamic blend of hip-hop and orchestral elements, with sweeping strings and brass, evoking the vibrant energy of the city.violins and synths that inspire awe at the finiteness of life and the universe80s electronic track with melodic synthesizers, catchy beat and groovy bassreggaeton track, with a booming 808 kick, synth melodies layered with Latin percussion elements, uplifting and energizinga piano and cello duet playing a sad chambers musicsmooth jazz, with a saxophone solo, piano chords, and snare full drumsa light and cheerly EDM track, with syncopated drums, aery pads, and strong emotionsa punchy double-bass and a distorted guitar riffacoustic folk song to play during roadtrips: guitar flute choirsrock with saturated guitars, a heavy bass line and crazy drum break and fills.Melody conditioningWe now experiment with our novel chroma-based melody conditioning.

    "hn_content": "A conversation on the Hacker News thread discusses the necessity and quality of music generated by AI versus music produced by humans. Some users argue that there is no lack of electronic music, just too much mediocrity. Others assert that AI-generated music has explored unusual, original spaces that humans have not yet tapped, but the challenge lies in making it enjoyable and original. The debate pointed out the abundance of fantastic music to discover on the internet and urged others to support local businesses when possible. The benefits of immediate feedback and low costs are seen as advantages to using AI tools for small passion projects. Additionally, AI-generated music may be used as a stepping stone towards creating new plugins for digital synthesis.The post discusses the benefits and limitations of using AI-generated music. The primary advantage is that it's both faster and cheaper than hiring a human composer. It can also provide an opportunity for greater and more immediate creative control over the product. Additionally, AI-generated music can tackle issues like output volume, variations, and revisions, which previously required long-term human involvement. However, some users remain skeptical of the quality of the generated music and concerns about copyrights since the non-human music has no legal basis. At present, it is not likely to surpass the music from dedicated composers, though it presents a useful alternative to background music for commercial purposes.MusicGen, an AI model that enables users to generate music by entering text prompts, is now available for anyone to use, according to an OpenAI blog post. The method transfers elements of music styles to new compositions and creates melodies to match text inputs, from upbeat love songs to minimal techno. Users can train the model on their own data. The workload limits quality and quantity, but one user claims to have written 50 usable songs with it. Critics, however, say the model isn't creative and lacks emotion. The licence enables people to use the model to create music but prevents them from selling it or editing it.The post discusses the potential implications of creating machine-generated music, including concerns around whether it will replace human-generated music. Some argue that it will democratize the ability to create music, while others see it as taking the joy out of the creative process. However, the actual example of machine-generated music given in the post is criticized for being generic and not resembling the artist it's compared to. The discussion highlights the tension between creating something that sounds good and having a shared emotional connection with the artist behind it. Overall, there is no consensus on the value of machine-generated music or whether it can truly replicate human artistic expression.Meta's AI music generator, MusicGen, has caught the attention of both music enthusiasts and software engineers. Despite some comments indicating that outputs sound safe, generic or irrelevant without social context, most respondents are excited about MusicGen's potential for assisting music producers. The generative model has been trained on various music styles, from classical to rock, and produces new music based on a melody prompt. It currently generates audio-based results only, but some suggest that MIDI files would be more useful. A potential milestone for AI music is the creation of a familiar AI-generated tune played in caf\u00e9s or recognized by large audiences. Meta's breakthrough development of MusicGen provides interesting implications for the music tech industry.Facebook AI has released an audio-to-MIDI model, AudioCraft, that can convert any sound into a MIDI file that a producer can edit. The system operates by using supervised machine learning and training on publicly available MIDI files to identify\u00a0patterns and mimic them in output. While some criticize the quality of the output as elevator music, others see the tool as having applications in gaming, independent content creation, and bespoke music. It may also provide a means of allowing people without musical training to create soundtracks or work with MIDI files. However, critics argue that music is already an oversupplied art form and further devaluing it could have major implications.Facebook AI research group developed a freely available generative AI audio toolkit called Audiocraft that can produce high-quality audio from MIDI files or audio samples. The toolkit works on Adobe's PyTorch and is a pre-trained generative model using Transformer-based neural networks. Audiocraft can do harmony, melody and rhythm separation techniques, chord recognition, and idiom specification. This toolkit eliminates the need for costly training data, as well as the recording and hand-editing of music tracks. There is also a machine learning guide to help train custom voices, with a suite of pre-trained voice models containing several artist's voices and language models available to download.

    "content": "PERSONAL TECHGermans beat Tesla to autonomous L3 driving in the Golden State34Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz, my friends all have Teslas...Brandon VigliaroloFri 9 Jun 2023 // 19:00 UTCMercedes-Benz scored another self-driving victory, and on Tesla's former home turf, after being granted the first authorization in the state of California \"to sell or lease vehicles with an automated driving system to the public,\" albeit with very strict restrictions.The permission slip was granted for Mercedes-Benz's DRIVE PILOT system, a Society of Automotive Engineers level 3 automated system that, unlike Tesla's level-2 Autopilot and other competing driver assist systems, can actually be classified as one that's doing the driving - most of the time, although you'll still need to be behind the wheel.\"An SAE Level 3 system actively performs driving tasks without the active control of a human driver under certain conditions, though the driver must remain behind the wheel to take over when prompted,\" the California DMV said in its announcement. According to Mercedes-Benz, DRIVE PILOT automatically controls speed and follow distance while staying in its lane and taking \"the route profile, events occurring on the route and traffic signs\" into consideration. The system is also able to react to unexpected situations with evasive maneuvers and braking, the German car biz claimed, and if a driver doesn't take over when prompted the car activates the hazard lights and slowly comes to a stop before making an emergency system call to alert first responders to a potential problem. Regardless of those capabilities, the California DMV is placing some serious restrictions on the Merc system. It can only operate during the day on certain limited roads, and only at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. The system will be usable on California highways in the Bay Area, Central Valley, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Diego, as well as on Interstate 15 between southern California and Nevada, where the autopilot was approved for use in January.Of course, the DMV's permission \"excludes operation on city or county streets, in construction zones, during heavy rain or heavy fog, on flooded roads and during weather conditions that are determined to impact performance of DRIVE PILOT,\" the Department said. Another blow to TeslaWith the Germans invading California and Nevada, the number of southwestern states housing Tesla facilities where it won't be forced to share the roads with more advanced self-driving technology is fading fast. Tesla is often mum about the actual capabilities of its \"full self-driving\" system - no mention of SAE levels appear on its Autopilot page, for example - but in the FAQ for an FSD recall earlier this year the company admits that \"FSD Beta is an SAE Level 2 driver support feature.\" Waymo robo-car slays dog in San FranciscoWatchdog calls for automatic braking to be standard in carsBuckle up for meetings on the road as Cisco brings Webex to Audi autosThe future of cars may be self-driving EVs gossiping about their humans and traffic\"With FSD Beta, as with all SAE Level 2 driver support features, the driver is responsible for operation of the vehicle whenever the feature is engaged and must constantly supervise the feature and intervene,\" Tesla notes in the recall FAQ. Tesla's Autopilot was the leader in the industry, but has since slipped to the middle of the pack, according to Consumer Reports. Even the limited professed abilities of Autopilot may be overrated, as one of the system's own engineers admitted a video reportedly demonstrating Autopilot's FSD capabilities was faked. Tesla has since confirmed that it's being investigated by the Department of Justice over FSD, hype surrounding it, and the many deaths linked to the system.We've asked Tesla for comment, but haven't heard back. \u00aeSimilar topicsAutomotiveAutopilotSelf-driving CarMore like these34 COMMENTSTIP US OFFSend us news",

    "hn_content": "Mercedes has obtained a permit to test a Level 4 autonomous vehicle on public roads in California, making it the first automaker to do so. The Level 4 car should be capable of driving itself without the need for human intervention in certain circumstances, with a goal of being fully autonomous in long-distance journeys. Some comments on the thread suggest focusing on more sustainable transportation infrastructure such as public transportation instead of self-driving cars. Others highlight the difficulties of car-sharing and losing control of their vehicle.- Europeans drive mostly manual cars and pay more attention to the road, leading to safer driving conditions\n- Lead footing, a phenomenon exclusive to automatics, can lead to dangerous situations\n- Lane departure warning systems and other safety features available for both automatic and manual vehicles can improve safety on the road\n- Self-driving cars can enhance driver abilities and provide a quality-of-life increase, especially in areas with high traffic\n- Buses and Bus Rapid Transit can provide a cheaper alternative to trains for transportationExperts discuss the economics of rail service and transportation infrastructure, with some arguing for less profitable, slower rail infrastructure serving less-traveled routes. Arguments for transferring the cost of funding transit infrastructure from users to taxpayers are met with opposing views, with some claiming it improves the economic performance of transportation. The conversation shifts towards autonomous vehicles, with individuals expressing a desire for self-driving cars to operate on designated routes and park themselves. Discussions of driving assistance technology, such as lane-keeping assist and \"automated rumble strips,\" are praised for increasing safety, but the possibility of removing sensors for manufacturing costs is criticized. Overall, the conversation covers a wide range of topics regarding transportation infrastructure and the potential drawbacks and benefits of newer technologies.Mercedes has released a Level 3 autonomous driving system which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel and their eyes off the road in certain conditions. The system has numerous limitations, such as only being operable under 40 mph and not being able to function in rain, fog, or construction zones. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, by contrast, is capable of navigating complex city streets in LA without human intervention for up to 60 minutes. Critics of Tesla's system, however, point out that it is still a beta product and requires constant supervision. Both companies are working towards Level 4 or 5 autonomy.Experts argue that taking control of a self-driving car within 10 seconds is not enough time to ensure safe operation. Users may also lack situational awareness if they are distracted while driving. A study on subjective measurement of time found that people's perceptions of time are often inaccurate. Videos show that autonomous driving systems, including Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Mercedes' Level 3 system, still require human intervention within a short period of activation. Tesla's FSD also tends to follow traffic regulations strictly, which may cause problems in areas where there are informal driving customs. The main takeaway is that while autonomous driving is a promising technology, it still requires extensive in-depth research, continuous improvement, and strict regulations to ensure that it is safe for operation.There is no meaningful content in the text to extract a summary.Safety in engineering is a mature methodology regularly used in aerospace, medical, civil, and automotive engineering applications, and assumptions of safety are fundamentally incompatible with safety-critical engineering. In the case of self-driving cars like Tesla, proving safety is challenging and requires direct access to the raw information, while proving unsafety is relatively easy and can be demonstrated by third parties. Liability for autonomous systems is a significant concern, and manufacturers like Mercedes assume liability for their systems, while Tesla doesn't. The EU mandates maximum lateral acceleration, lane change times, and many other details that make for a worse and less safe driving experience. Tesla Autopilot has been involved in various crashes, and there have been fatalities, making the numbers reported completely different from those for conventional cars.According to recent Consumer Reports testing, Tesla's Autopilot system fell to seventh place overall in driver assistance systems, with Ford's BlueCruise coming out on top. Tesla's system has not made major changes to its basic functionality since its introduction, leading to a stagnation of its capabilities compared to its competitors. While some commenters praised Tesla's safety record, others pointed out that such statistics are meaningless without considering the number of hours Tesla's FSD system is active compared to those of other ADA systems. Additionally, the comments section features debate over the worth of both Tesla and Mercedes' ADAS and FSD systems, and how regulatory restrictions limit the efficacy of these solutions.- A discussion on the safety and effectiveness of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta system versus other autonomous driving features on the market.\n- Some commenters express concern over the accuracy of Tesla's driver attention monitoring system, but others argue that it is effective and annoyingly strict.\n- Several examples of FSD Beta errors and close calls are shared, with some arguing that the system is not ready for widespread use.\n- Mercedes' Drive Pilot system is mentioned as an alternative to Tesla's FSD Beta, with some arguing that Mercedes' approach of documenting limitations is a positive sign.\n- A debate over whether having millions of drivers testing autonomous systems for a few minutes a day is better than relying on hired testers for extended periods of time. \n- A few comments express skepticism over both Tesla's marketing of FSD Beta and the competency of autonomous driving systems in general.",
    "hn_summary": "- Mercedes obtains permit to test Level 4 autonomous car in California, first automaker to do so\n- Tesla's Full Self-Driving system capable of navigating complex city streets without human intervention, but critics point out it is still in beta\n- Safety, liability, and regulation are primary concerns for autonomous driving systems"

The integration required a colossal undertaking from many developers. Some readers debunked the claims made by OBS and described the implementation as more of a \"direct connection\" than \"peer-to-peer.\" Users noted that Twitch's reach may decrease as a result of this technology, and that it could be used for a streaming platform as easy to set up as a WordPress blog. Overall, the integration of WebRTC into OBS is a significant development that will inspire new features and functionality for users.Video streaming technology WebRTC has been praised for its features, including low latency and direct connection between streamer and receiver. However, it may not always work if there is bad connectivity or a conference call situation. Selective Forwarding Units (SFUs) can help reduce direct connections across large calls by sending aggregated, downsampled streams of all the participants. In addition, SFUs receive media streams from multiple participants but only forward a subset of those to certain participants. Theoretically, media streams are identified by a 32-bit number, which means it can serve about 4 billion clients, while data streams are limited to 65535 endpoints. WHIP (WebRTC-HTTP ingest protocol) enables the use of WebRTC in conjunction with media servers and CDNs, allowing users to stream online easily. The news is special because WebRTC support was recently added to FFmpeg, making it more accessible to users.The comment thread on a recent post about OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) discusses the technical complexities of using STUN/TURN servers to enable WebRTC video conferencing on networks with NAT and firewalls. Several users suggest using alternative screen capture software such as ShareX for lower performance PCs, while others discuss potential solutions and challenges to address the limitations of STUN/TURN. Additionally, users inquire about OBS's potential to support additional streaming features and technologies, and suggest potential improvements for OBS's screen recording capabilities.

    "content": "Vehicles sit in traffic while exiting the Williamsburg Bridge on May 10, 2023 in New York City.Erik Pendzich/ShutterstockNew YorkCNN \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is set to allow New York City to move forward with a landmark program that will toll vehicles entering Lower Manhattan, after a public review period ends Monday.The toll is formally known as the Central Business District Tolling Program \u2014 but it\u2019s commonly called \u201ccongestion pricing.\u201dIn practice it works like any other toll, but because it specifically charges people to drive in the traffic-choked area below 60th street in Manhattan, it would be the first program of its kind in the United States.Proposals range from charging vehicles $9 to $23 during peak hours, and it\u2019s set to go into effect next spring.The plan had been delayed for years, but it cleared a milestone last month when the Federal Highway Administration signed off on the release of an environmental assessment. The public has until Monday to review the report, and the federal government is widely expected to approve it shortly after.From there, the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) can finalize toll rates, as well as discounts and exemptions for certain drivers.New York City is still clawing out of from the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Congestion pricing advocates say it\u2019s a crucial piece of the city\u2019s recovery and a way to re-imagine the city for the future.\u201cThis program is critical to New York City\u2019s long-term success,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said last month.The plan would also mark the culmination of more than a half-century of efforts to implement congestion pricing in New York City. Despite support from several New York City mayors and state governors, car and truck owners in outer boroughs and the suburbs helped defeat proposals.In 2007 Mayor Michael Bloomberg called congestion \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d when proposing a toll program, which state lawmakers killed. A decade later, Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 who had long resisted congestion pricing \u2014 said it was \u201can idea whose time has come\u201d and declared a subway state of emergency after increased delays and a derailment that injured dozens. Two years later, the state gave the MTA approval to design a congestion pricing program.Ultimately, it was the need to improve New York City\u2019s public transit that became the rallying cry for congestion pricing.Worst gridlock in United StatesEach day 700,000 cars, taxis and trucks pour into Lower Manhattan, one of the busiest areas in the world with some of the worst gridlock in the United States.Car travel at just 7.1 mph on average in the congestion price zone, and it\u2019s a downward trend. Public bus speeds have also declined 28% since 2010. New Yorkers lose 117 hours on average each year sitting in traffic, costing them nearly $2,000 in lost productivity and other costs, according to one estimate.The toll is designed to reduce the number of vehicles entering the congestion zone by at least 10% every day and slash the number of miles cars travel within the zone by 5%.Congestion comes with physical and societal costs, too: more accidents, carbon emissions and pollution happen as belching, honking cars take up space that could be optimized for pedestrians and outdoor dining.Proponents also note it will improve public transit, an essential part of New York life. About 75% of trips downtown are via public transit.But public-transit ridership is 35% to 45% lower compared to pre-pandemic levels. The MTA says congestion fees will generate a critical source of revenue to fund $15 billion in future investments to modernize the city\u2019s 100-year-old public transit system.Congestion pricing is designed to improve New York City's subways and buses, which have struggled to recover since the pandemic.Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesThe improvements, like new subway cars and electric signals, are crucial to draw new riders and improve speed and accessibility \u2014 especially for low-income and minority residents, who are least likely to own cars, say plan advocates.New York City is \u201cdependent on public transit,\u201d said Kate Slevin, the executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban planning and policy group. \u201cWe\u2019re relying on that revenue to pay for needed upgrades and investments that ensure reliable, good transit service.\u201dImproving public transportation is also key to New York City\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery: If commutes to work are too unreliable, people are less likely to visit the office and shop at stores around their workplaces. Congestion charge advocates hope the program will create more space for amenities like wider sidewalks, bike lanes, plazas, benches, trees and public bathrooms.\u201c100 years ago we decided the automobile was the way to go, so we narrowed sidewalks and built highways,\u201d said Sam Schwartz, former New York City traffic commissioner and founder of an eponymous consulting firm. \u201cBut the future of New York City is that the pedestrian should be king and queen. Everything should be subservient to the pedestrian.\u201dBenefits, critiques and mitigation measuresWhile no other US city has yet implemented congestion pricing, Stockholm, London and Singapore have had it for years.These cities have reported benefits like decreased carbon dioxide pollution, higher average speeds, and congestion reduction.Just one year after London added its charge in 2003, traffic congestion dropped by 30% and average speeds increased by the same percentage. In Stockholm, one study found the rate of children\u2019s acute asthma visits to the doctor fell by about 50% compared to rates before the program launched in 2007.Some groups are fiercely opposed to congestion charges in New York City, however. Taxi and ride-share drivers, largely a low-income and immigrant workforce, fear it will hurt drivers already struggling to make ends meet. The MTA said congestion pricing could reduce demand for taxis by up to 17% in the zone.Commuters and legislators from New York City\u2019s outer boroughs and New Jersey say the program hurts drivers who have no viable way to reach downtown Manhattan other than by car, and that this would disproportionately impact low-income drivers. (But out of a region of 28 million people, just an estimated 16,100 low-income people commute to work via car in Lower Manhattan, according to the MTA.)High speed trains are racing across the world. But not in AmericaOther critics say it could divert more traffic and pollution from diesel trucks in Manhattan into lower-income areas like the Bronx, which has the highest rates of asthma hospitalization in the city.The MTA and other agencies have plans to mitigate many of these adverse effects, however.Taxis and for-hire vehicles will be tolled only once a day. Drivers who make less than $50,000 a year or are enrolled in certain government aid programs will get 25% discounts after their first 10 trips every month. Trucks and other vehicles will get 50% discounts during overnight hours.Additionally, the MTA pledged $10 million to install air filtration units in schools near highways, $20 million for a program to fight asthma, and other investments to improve air quality and the enviornment in areas where more traffic could be diverted.The stakes of New York City\u2019s program are high, and leaders in other cities are watching the results closely.If successful, congestion pricing could be a model for other US cities, which are trying to recover from the pandemic and face similar challenges of climate change and aging public infrastructure.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see New York City\u2019s program is moving forward,\u201d said the Los Angeles Times Editorial Board last month. \u201cLos Angeles should watch, learn and go next.\u201d",

    "hn_content": "New York City will charge drivers going downtown to reduce congestion. Concerns are raised on the state's inability to improve transit infrastructure with the collected billings. New York City's transit system is inferior to other metropolises as it is hamstrung by bureaucracy. Parking congestion is seen as the primary cause for traffic congestion. The MTA is believed to have inflated infrastructure costs for the expansion of train lines by not publishing itemized bills. The city needs a modern era Robert Moses to consolidate agencies. Robert Moses is known for egregious urban planning methods, but he played a role in building transit systems in New York. Examples of poor decisions by Moses leading to transit flaws in New York are cited. Congestion pricing is a useful measure for deterring driving, but logistics for converting billings to transit infrastructure must improve. New York City's transit system is such that there is no other fallback option to driving. The two union workers on trains are necessary to ensure riders' safety.This post discusses various issues with the New York City subway system and transportation infrastructure, including concerns about safety, costs, and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Some commenters argue that having two employees on each subway is unnecessary, and that other cities operate with just one driver, while others highlight problems with congested streets and outdated infrastructure. There are also debates about the need for congestion pricing and the role of Robert Moses in shaping the city's transportation system. Overall, the post highlights ongoing challenges and debates surrounding transportation in one of the world's largest cities.New York City is considering implementing congestion pricing, a fee for cars entering the city's central business district, to alleviate traffic congestion and raise funds for public transit. There is opposition to congestion pricing due to concerns about increased costs for drivers and the regressive nature of the fees. Supporters argue that it will incentivize the use of more efficient transportation and generate funding for improvements to public transit. Discussions also involve the challenges of retrofitting existing transit stations with PSDs (platform screen doors) to improve safety and efficiency. The opposition to congestion pricing includes criticisms of past government mismanagement of transportation funds and concerns about the impact on low-income individuals and families.New York is set to become the first US city to introduce a congestion charge, following in the footsteps of London, which was the first in the world back in 2003. The New York charge, which will be rolled out in 2021, debates $11.52 for cars and small trucks, $25.34 for trucks, and $2 to $5 for taxis and ride-hailing services. The aim is to reduce traffic congestion, pollution, and improve public health. Some readers suggest that a discount should be offered for motorcyclists. Critics argue that a new congestion charge is an unfair addition to those already paying high bridge and tunnel tolls.New York is implementing congestion pricing to reduce traffic and raise revenue for the MTA. The plan is for revenue to accrue to the MTA, a public benefit corporation owned by NY State. Whether cities can undertake congestion pricing depends on state/local laws and political support. London is a successful example due to the exceptional state of its underground, but every city has its own circumstances. San Antonio and Atlanta have created non-motorized vehicle corridors through the respective cities which have spurred mixed-use development. The concentration of wealth in linear urban areas has the side effect of having lower-income houses available in closer proximity to the wealthy areas. Congestion pricing in the US is possible, though its implementation depends on various factors such as access to alternatives and government approval.Singapore's impressive city planning and public transport systems are praised, with extensive underground walkways and planter boxes along roads and freeways. The implementation of congestion pricing in Manhattan prompts a debate on the benefits and downsides of dense urban living, with arguments made for and against high-density housing and public transportation. Some argue that increased density results in declining living conditions, while others argue that it creates new housing options. The discussion also highlights the potential negative effects of public transit on the environment and infrastructure.A heated discussion on infrastructure funding in the US took place on Hacker News. The conversation debated whether transit subsidies should be increased, people should pay for their road use, and whether transit can be run without subsidies. The argument suggests that transit subsidies are infeasible as roads are already subsidized and that transit is an essential service. Conversely, some argue that people pay for cars and bus-users are already subsidized.\nThe Tech Times reports on a discussion around the impact of a proposed congestion charge in Lower Manhattan. Supporters argue that congestion pricing would reduce wasteful driving and subsidies for car drivers and encourage public transit use, while opponents argue that it would disproportionately affect low-income Americans who need to commute by car due to a lack of better options. There is consensus that better urban planning and increased public transit are sustainable ways to reduce traffic congestion, but there is little control over that currently. The proposed congestion charge is below 60th street and limited to the well-off since parking is already expensive in that area. The current model has made driving unnaturally cheap, and road maintenance is subsidized by those who pay fuel and car-tab taxes.- 16K companies may need to increase pay to attract workers.\n- A debate emerges on the use of public transportation and discrimination based on socioeconomic status.\n- Lee Atwater's hot mic moment from the 1980s Republican plan is referenced.\n- The building of low bridges to keep out poor and black individuals is discussed.\n- The debate on car safety and affordability arises, with concerns over regulations and disparities based on income.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36274525",
    "content": "June 8, 202325 CommentsIt\u2019s not often that a zero-day vulnerability causes a network security vendor to urge customers to physically remove and decommission an entire line of affected hardware \u2014 as opposed to just applying software updates. But experts say that is exactly what transpired this week with Barracuda Networks, as the company struggled to combat a sprawling malware threat which appears to have undermined its email security appliances in such a fundamental way that they can no longer be safely updated with software fixes.The Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) 900 appliance.Campbell, Calif. based Barracuda said it hired incident response firm Mandiant on May 18 after receiving reports about unusual traffic originating from its Email Security Gateway (ESG) devices, which are designed to sit at the edge of an organization\u2019s network and scan all incoming and outgoing email for malware.On May 19, Barracuda identified that the malicious traffic was taking advantage of a previously unknown vulnerability in its ESG appliances, and on May 20 the company pushed a patch for the flaw to all affected appliances (CVE-2023-2868).In its security advisory, Barracuda said the vulnerability existed in the Barracuda software component responsible for screening attachments for malware. More alarmingly, the company said it appears attackers first started exploiting the flaw in October 2022.But on June 6, Barracuda suddenly began urging its ESG customers to wholesale rip out and replace \u2014 not patch \u2014 affected appliances.\u201cImpacted ESG appliances must be immediately replaced regardless of patch version level,\u201d the company\u2019s advisory warned. \u201cBarracuda\u2019s recommendation at this time is full replacement of the impacted ESG.\u201dIn a statement, Barracuda said it will be providing the replacement product to impacted customers at no cost, and that not all ESG appliances were compromised.\u201cNo other Barracuda product, including our SaaS email solutions, were impacted by this vulnerability,\u201d the company said. \u201cIf an ESG appliance is displaying a notification in the User Interface, the ESG appliance had indicators of compromise. If no notification is displayed, we have no reason to believe that the appliance has been compromised at this time.\u201dNevertheless, the statement says that \u201cout of an abundance of caution and in furtherance of our containment strategy, we recommend impacted customers replace their compromised appliance.\u201d\u201cAs of June 8, 2023, approximately 5% of active ESG appliances worldwide have shown any evidence of known indicators of compromise due to the vulnerability,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cDespite deployment of additional patches based on known IOCs, we continue to see evidence of ongoing malware activity on a subset of the compromised appliances. Therefore, we would like customers to replace any compromised appliance with a new unaffected device.\u201dRapid7\u2018s Caitlin Condon called this remarkable turn of events \u201cfairly stunning,\u201d and said there appear to be roughly 11,000 vulnerable ESG devices still connected to the Internet worldwide.\u201cThe pivot from patch to total replacement of affected devices is fairly stunning and implies the malware the threat actors deployed somehow achieves persistence at a low enough level that even wiping the device wouldn\u2019t eradicate attacker access,\u201d Condon wrote.Barracuda said the malware was identified on a subset of appliances that allowed the attackers persistent backdoor access to the devices, and that evidence of data exfiltration was identified on some systems.Rapid7 said it has seen no evidence that attackers are using the flaw to move laterally within victim networks. But that may be small consolation for Barracuda customers now coming to terms with the notion that foreign cyberspies probably have been hoovering up all their email for months.Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at University of California, Berkeley\u2019s International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), said it is likely that the malware was able to corrupt the underlying firmware that powers the ESG devices in some irreparable way.\u201cOne of the goals of malware is to be hard to remove, and this suggests the malware compromised the firmware itself to make it really hard to remove and really stealthy,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a ransomware actor, that\u2019s a state actor. Why? Because a ransomware actor doesn\u2019t care about that level of access. They don\u2019t need it. If they\u2019re going for data extortion, it\u2019s more like a smash-and-grab. If they\u2019re going for data ransoming, they\u2019re encrypting the data itself \u2014 not the machines.\u201dIn addition to replacing devices, Barracuda says ESG customers should also rotate any credentials connected to the appliance(s), and check for signs of compromise dating back to at least October 2022 using the network and endpoint indicators the company has released publicly.Update, June 9, 11:55 a.m. ET: Barracuda has issued an updated statement about the incident, portions of which are now excerpted above.This entry was posted on Thursday 8th of June 2023 04:17 PMLATEST WARNINGS TIME TO PATCHBARRACUDA NETWORKS CAITLIN CONDON CVE-2023-2868 EMAIL SECURITY GATEWAY INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER SCIENCE INSTITUTE MANDIANT NICHOLAS WEAVER RAPID7",
