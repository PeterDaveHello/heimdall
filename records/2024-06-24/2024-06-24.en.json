Some time ago, Hillel Wayne published an article titled Microfeatures I’d like to see in more languages. In this article, he described three kinds of features in programming languages: fundamental features, deeply engrained features, and nice-to-have convenience features. Hillel’s premise was that language designers tend to focus on the first two; however, because the convenience features are relatively low-overhead, it’s easier for them to jump between projects, and they provide a quality-of-life increase. I’ve been running a blog for a while — some of the oldest posts I’ve found (which are no longer reflected on this site due to their low quality) were from 2015. In this time, I’ve been on the lookout for ways to improve the site, and I’ve seen quite a few little things that are nice to use, but relatively easy to implement. They don’t really make or break a website; the absence of such features might be noticed, but will not cause any disruption for the reader. On the other hand, their presence serves as a QoL enhancement. I find these to be analogous to Hillel’s notion of “microfeatures”. If you’re interested in adding something to your site, consider browsing this menu to see if anything resonates! One last thing is that this post is not necessarily about microfeatures I’d like every blog or personal website to have. Some ideas I present here are only well-suited to certain types of content and certain written voices. They need not be applied indiscriminately. With that, let’s get started! Sidenotes Gwern is, in my view, the king of sidenotes. Gwern’s writing makes very heavy use of them (at least based on the articles that I’ve read). This is where I originally got inspiration for my own implementation in Hugo. Check out the page on hydrocephalus for an example; Here’s what a piece of that page looks like on my end at the time of writing: A screenshot of Gwern’s page on hydrocephalus Sidenotes are nice because they allow for diversions without interrupting the main article’s flow. You can provide additional details for the curious reader, or — as Gwern does — use the sidenotes for citing studies or sources. In either case, the reading experience is significantly more pleasant that footnotes, for which you typically have to go to the bottom of the page, and then return to the top. Another reason I called Gwern the “king of sidenotes” is this page on sidenotes. There, Gwern documents numerous approaches to this feature, mostly inspired by Tufte CSS. The page is very thorough — it even includes a link to my own work, as unknown as it may be! I would recommend checking it out if you are interested in enhancing your site with sidenotes. Tables of Contents Not all personal sites include tables of contents (TOCs), but they are nice. They serve two purposes: Seeing at a glance what the post will be about, in the form of headings. Being able to navigate to an interesting part of the page without having to scroll. Static site generators (I myself use Hugo) are typically able to generate TOCs automatically, since they are already generating the HTML and know what headings they are inserting into the page. For instance, Hugo has TableOfContents. I suspect the same is true for other existing website technologies. Despite this, I actually had to look relatively long to find sites I frequent that have TOCs to show off as examples here. The first one I came across — after Gwern’s, whose site will be mentioned plenty in this post anyway — is Faster than Lime. Take this post on Rust’s Futures; this is what the top of it looks like at the time of writing: A screenshot of the table of contents on Faster than Lime The quality and value of TOCs certainly depends on the sections within the page itself — and whether or not the page has sections at all! — but in my opinion, the benefits to navigation become apparent even for relatively simple pages. As an honorable mention, I’d like to show Lars Hupel’s site. The pages on the site don’t — as far as I can tell — have internal tables of contents. However, pages that are part of a series — such as the introduction to CRDTs — have tables of contents that span the entire series. A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site I also find this very nice, though it does miss out on headings within a page. Bonus: Showing Page Progress I’ve mentioned that tables of contents can communicate the structure of the page. However, they do so from the outset, before you’ve started reading. In their “base form”, the reader stops benefiting from tables of contents once they've started reading. [note: That is, of course, unless they jump back to the top of the post and find the table of contents again. ] If you want to show progress while the reader is somewhere in the middle of a page, you could use a page progress bar. I’ve noticed one while reading Quanta Magazine; it looks like this (recording my scrolling through the most recent article at the time of writing). The progress bar on a Quanta Magazine article One immediate thought is that this is completely superseded by the regular browser scroll bar that’s ever-present at the side of the page. However, the scroll bar could be deceiving. If your page has a comments section, the comments could make the page look dauntingly long. Similarly, references to other pages and general “footer material” count towards the scroll bar, but would not count towards the progress bar. Combining the two, you could imagine an always-visible table of contents that highlights the current section you’re in. With such a feature, you can always see where you are (including a rough estimate of how far into the page you’ve scrolled), and at the same time see how the current section integrates into the broader structure. I’ve seen this done before, but could not find a site off the top of my head that implements the feature; as a fallback, here’s the CSS tricks tutorial that shows how to implement a dynamic table of contents, and a recording of me scrolling through it: The table of contents from a CSS Tricks demo Easily Linkable Headings How can you link a particular section of a page to your friend? There’s a well-defined mechanism to do this in HTML: you can use the ID of a particular HTML element, and add it as #some-id to the end of a link to the page. The link then takes the user to that particular HTML element. I can do this, for instance, to link to the sidenotes section above. How does one discover the ID of the part of the page that they want to link to? The ID is not a “visual” property; it’s not displayed to the user, and is rather a detail of HTML itself. Thus, on any given page, even if every element has a unique, linkable ID, I can’t make use of it without going into Inspect Element and trying to find the ID in the HTML tree. The simple solution is to make the elements that you want to be easily “linkable” into links to themselves! Then, the user can right-click the element in question (probably the heading) and click Copy Link. Much easier! To demonstrate a similar idea, here is a link to this paragraph itself. You can now use the context menu to Copy Link, put it in your browser, and voilà — you’re right back here! As with tables of contents, many website technologies provide most of the tooling to add support for this feature. Relatively often I come across pages that have unique IDs for each header, but no clickable links! I end up having to use inspect element to find the anchor points. A variation on this idea — if you don’t want to make the entire heading or title a link — is to include alongside it (before or after) a clickable element that is a link to that title. You can click that element to retrieve link information, instead (and the icon additionally tells you that this is possible). Hugo’s documentation does this: here’s a screenshot of an arbitrary page. A title and paragraph from the Hugo documentation Grouping Series of Posts Some authors like to write at length on a particular topic; to get the content out to readers faster (and to make the resulting pages less daunting), it makes sense to break a single topic up into a series. The easiest way to do this is to just… publish several articles, possibly with related names, and link them to each other. Done! With a little more effort, though, the series-reading and series-writing experience could be nicer. Instead of manually inserting links, you could configure your website to automatically add a “next” and “previous” button to pages in a given series. You could also give an overview of a particular series and create a “navigation hub” for it. As an example, the Chapel language blog has navigation buttons. Here’s a screenshot from a post in the Advent of Code series: Series navigation buttons on a Chapel blog post I’ve mentioned this in the section on tables of contents, but Lars Hupel’s site has tables of contents that link between series. I’m not sure if it’s automatically generated or hand-written, but it’s definitely nice. A screenshot of the table of contents on Lars Hupel’s site Dialogues I first came across dialogues on Xe Iaso’s site, but I think I see them used most often in posts on Faster than Lime. As an example, here’s a little dialogue on a post about Rust’s futures. At the time of writing, it looks like this: A dialogue with “cool bear” on Faster than Lime Using dialogues — even for technical writing — is not a particularly novel idea. I know I’ve seen it in a textbook before; probably this part of Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces. It can help ask questions from a less-experienced point of view, and therefore possibly voice concerns that a reader might themselves be having. And of course — as with “cool bear” and Xe Iaso’s many characters — it can change the tone and make the page a bit more fun. Code Blocks with Origin This one was recommended to me by a reader, and so I’ll be talking about my page specifically! When I was writing about making a compiler, a reader emailed me and pointed out that they were getting lost in the various code blocks. My page displayed the code that I was writing about, but the project had grown beyond a single file. As a result, I’d be making changes midway through one file at one moment, and another file the next. This prompted me to add decorators to my code blocks that look something like this: From patterns.rb, lines 3 through 8 3 4 5 6 7 8 def sum_digits(n) while n > 9 n = n.to_s.chars.map(&:to_i).sum end n end The decorator says what file the code is from, as well as what lines are being presented. If you click the file name, the decorator links to my Gitea instance, allowing you to read the code in context. Though it’s not quite the same (in particular, it’s unfortunately missing links), the Crafting Interpreters online book does something similar. It describes changes to the code in words next to the changed code itself, like “added after MyStruct”. Here’s a screenshot of the page on local variables at the time of writing. Location notes on code in Crafting Interpreters I think it looks quite elegant, and in some ways — specifically in the verbal descriptions of what each change does — might be superior to my approach. It’s not quite the same thing, but GitHub Gists can help approximate this feature. A Gist could contain multiple files, and each file can be individually embedded into your page. Hugo in particular has built-in support for Gists (and I’ve snagged that link using the docs’ easily linkable headings); I suspect that other website engines have some form of support as well. At the time of writing, an embedded Gist looks something like this: Code embedded in Hugo documentation using a GitHub Gist Clicking list.html takes you to the source code of the file. Bonus: Code Blocks with Clickable Links If we’re going for fancy code blocks, another fancy feature is provided by the Agda programming language. Agda can generate HTML code blocks in which every symbol (like a variable, record name, function name) are linked to where they are defined. So if you’re reading the code, and wonder “what the heck is x?”, you can just click it to see how it’s defined. It’s not simple to integrate Agda’s plain HTML output into an existing webpage, but some projects do that. I took a stab at it in my post about integrating it with Hugo. I wager this would be even harder for other languages. However, it leads to nice results; my go-to is Programming Languages Foundations in Agda. The online book introduces various concepts from Programming Language Theory, and each code block that it shows is fully linked. This makes it possible to jump around the page like so: Navigating code blocks on a page from PLFA Markers for External Links Some sites I’ve seen mark links that go to a different domain with a little icon. If you’ve read this far, you’ve likely noticed that my site does the same. Another good example of this — even though the CSS is little rough at the time of writing — is James’ Coffee Blog ☕. I’ve taken the (small) liberty to adjust the color of the icon, which I suspect is buggy in my browser. An external link on James’ blog Some websites (this one included) also make such links open in a new tab automatically. That way, you tend to not lose the original article by clicking through one of its references. Bonus: Different Markers for Different Destinations Gwern’s website takes this idea further, by changing the icon for external links depending on the destination. For instance, links to Wikipedia articles are stylized with a little “W”, links to Haskell.org are stylized using a lambda ( 𝜆 λ), and links to .zip files have a little archive icon. There are more; I’ve found the link processing code on GitHub, and even the list of websites that get their own icons. I could not find a verbal description, though. Now for some pictures. Here are a ton of links from the “About” page! Links to Wikipedia on Gwern’s site A link to Haskell.org on Gwern’s site Links zip files on Gwern’s site Bonus: Link Preview Gwern’s website has no shortage of cool ideas. Among them showing link previews on hover. When hovering over a link, the site displays a popup window that contains a view into that page. I suspect that this view is also archived somehow, so that it retains a view into the page that matches it at the time of writing. To be perfectly honest, I found this feature a little jarring at first. As I would try to click links, I would get surprised by an additional overlay. However, as I spent more time browsing the site, I grew quite accustomed to the previews. I would hover over a link to see the first paragraph and thus get a short synopsis. This worked really well in tandem with per-destination marker icons; I could tell at a glance whether a link was worth hovering over. Here’s what it looks like: Hovering over a link on Gwern’s site RSS Feeds RSS is a feed standard that allows sites to publish updates. Blogs in particular can make use of RSS to notify readers of updates. RSS feeds are processed by a feed reader, which is a program that polls a website’s index.xml file (or other similar files) and reads it to detect new content. If you opt in to full-text RSS feeds, users can read the entire post entirely from their reader. RSS makes it easier to keep up with your site. Rather than having to check in on every author whose content I enjoy on the internet, I can add their feed URL to my list, and have my feed reader automatically aggregate all updates for me to read. It’s kind of like a social media or news feed, except that I control what’s shown to me, and authors of the blogs I follow don’t need to create accounts and explicitly share their work on social media! I don’t have any particular website to show off in this section; instead I’ll show you a list of websites that I’m following in my feed reader of choice. You might notice that a lot of these websites are listed here as inspiration for other microfeatures. A screenshot of my Feedbin list Links to Other Sites This feature I first noticed on Drew DeVault’s blog. Every page on Drew’s blog, at the bottom, has a section titled “Articles from blogs I read”. For instance, on a sample post, at the time of writing, I’m seeing the following footer: Links to other blogs from Drew DeVault’s blog As indicated in the image, Drew’s site in particular uses a program called openring, which is based on RSS feeds (another microfeature I love). However, how the site finds such articles (statically like openring, or on page load using some JavaScript) isn’t hugely important to me. What’s important is that you’re promoting other content creators whose work you enjoy, which is the ethos of my favorite slice of the internet. Conclusion + Anything Else? Those are all the microfeatures that I could think of in a single sitting. I hope that you have been inspired to integrate features like these into your own site, or at the very least that you think doing so would be a good idea. This list isn’t exhaustive. I’ve probably missed some good microfeatures! If you can think of such a feature, let me know; my email address is linked in the footer of this article. Thank you for reading, and cheers!",

(I should make my subheds clickable!) But a couple of them, oh dear… I really hate progress bars, they are incredibly distracting. One of the worst examples of front end programmers wasting their time reimplementing browser functions badly. I already have scroll bars! I do not need more scroll bars! Also, link decoration: my browser already has a nice discreet indicator to tell me where a link goes, I don’t need or want mysterious dingbats in the running text. (It reminds me of websites that are so scared of hyperlinks that they send them via interstitial warning pages “YOU ARE LEAVING THE SITE!!!!1!1!”, or in a recent case via a $yber$ecurity box that broke the link completely.) And preview popups? Get in the sea, hostile obnoxious interruption. reply elric 3 hours agoparentI think progress bars are a logical consequence of the user-hostile shrinking of the scrollbar. Unusable, narrow things which are often hidden by default, and rarely have a visible elevator (or thumb) anymore. Of course, scrollbars are often entirely useless in pages which insist on loading content piecemeal -- another user hostile pattern. reply WorldMaker 2 hours agorootparentMost of these progress bars are as thin as the native scrollbars have gotten (or thinner). If these are solely a consequence to the shrinking of the scrollbar, you'd imagine that they'd actually be bigger. I think that's a large contributing factor, but either most implementations are are as deficient [0] as what they are trying to augment or there are other things at play here. (Branding since websites haven't been able to consistently style browser scrollbars since the IE/early Firefox era; as the other comment points out, trying to counterbalance how long pages have gotten with \"after-content\" such as ads and comments and recommended articles and \"infinite scroll\" to more articles.) [0] Or arguably worse deficient: Most of them seem to have no real accessibility themselves and are opaque to things like screen readers. Even if modern scroll bars are hidden by default and woefully tiny visually by default, they still have decades of accessibility baked in and accessible options (if you can find them). reply gessha 2 hours agorootparentprevTo add to this, pages sometimes have comments or footers or other bells and whistles after the content that I’m interested in and it makes me think the post is longer than it is. This leads me to either leave the post for later or straight up close it because it’s too long. reply mschuster91 2 hours agorootparent> To add to this, pages sometimes have comments or footers or other bells and whistles after the content that I’m interested in Or, especially in news sites, Taboola and other bottom feeder trash. reply pc86 2 hours agorootparentprevWhether or not either of these is user-hostile is up to interpretation and preference, but you're stating it as if it is objective fact. You see user-hostile shrinking of the scrollbar, someone else sees more room for content and hiding something that isn't necessary until you need it. You see loading content piecemeal as hostile, someone else sees blocking that 1kb of text from being displayed while you do more network-intensive work as hostile. reply layer8 1 hour agorootparentRegarding scrollbars, it’s user-hostile if the user can’t control it according to their preference. reply jonahx 1 hour agoparentprevTo be fair, the author notes this and offers an alternative: > One immediate thought is that this is completely superseded by the regular browser scroll bar that’s ever-present at the side of the page.

I personally feel like they also \"hurry\" you into reading faster. If I see a progress bar, my first instinct is to try to finish as quickly as possible, even if that means a poorer understanding of the text. reply gnicholas 34 minutes agoparentprevFunny, I quite like progress bars!

This is addressed though in the following paragraph (indirectly), where a table of contents is rendered on the side. (Similar is a minimap, which I like for code or complex articles, but not for long text-heavy articles.) Maybe you also hate that, but it actually serves a purpose that scrollbar can never replicate and is much more useful than a scrollbar for many people. reply FullGarden_S 1 hour agoparentprevI think horizontal progress bars are annoying but I think I'm fine with vertical progress bar to the side on heading navigation, highlighting the currently reading sub-heading. reply throwaway894345 17 minutes agoparentprev> I really hate progress bars, they are incredibly distracting. One of the worst examples of front end programmers wasting their time reimplementing browser functions badly. I already have scroll bars! I do not need more scroll bars! I'm just really glad that we seem to have mostly moved past headers that expand down in front of the content you're trying to read as you scroll down the screen. I can't think of a single justifiable reason for this behavior, but it was all the rage for a while. Also, I suspect the progress bars resurged because browsers became enamored with invisible or barely-visible scroll bars. reply mrb 1 hour agoprevOne micro feature I implement on my blog that I would like to see everywhere: a single-page index of all the posts, like at https://blog.zorinaq.com Don't paginate this. I want to see at a glance the titles of all the posts the author wrote. I want to be able to ctrl-f to search these titles. Heck, even if you had 100k titles they could still easily be shown on one page, as it would compress to 1 or 2MB transmitted on the wire which is still more lightweight than the average web page size. reply aaronax 14 minutes agoparentThere is a \"back-channel\" way for most sites: sitemap.xml Many sites have it, since it is helpful for SEO.

I'll take some of the ideas on board. I've been working on a blogging service myself (here's my blog on it https://lmno.lol/alvaro), focusing on minimalism, hopefully enabling the content to shine on any kind of device (you can read from your favorite terminal too). You drag and drop your entire blog from a markdown file https://indieweb.social/@xenodium/112265481282475542 (feels more like keeping notes, which you happen to export as a blog). Service hasn't officially launched. You can play with https://lmno.lol (ephemeral posts) without signing up. Reach out if you'd like to register a blog (invite at lmno.lol). ps. ASCII art is not displaying properly on Android (known issue). So far, I can only fix by including a monospace font. I'd love to know if this is still possible to fix using system fonts. reply thomasfromcdnjs 3 hours agoparentThe import/export reminds me of my own little blog generator project I've been working on over the years (super immature) Essentially, your whole blog is just one file called \"resume.json\" that describes where all your post/pages come from, they could be external or local resources linked -> https://github.com/jsonblog/jsonblog-cli/blob/master/blog.js... And then you have \"generators\" which are just functions, that can take your blog.json and output all the required html/assets to build it e.g. https://github.com/jsonblog/jsonblog-generator-boilerplate The main idea being that you only ever have to keep safe your blog.json, which you could put as a gist or anything.

Some I have on my site (https://evalapply.org), some I don't because I don't want to require Javascript for blog functionality. I think I have a few others not in that list. This is my set of \"microfeatures\", which are all available in the post I linked below [1]. - All posts must have title, summary, dates (published, updated), one tag at least, and hot link to top of post (it's always #main) - Open graph metadata for all pages (title + summary) - All first-party content must be accessible as plain HTML - Typography and separator elements to establish structure and distinguish functionally different areas of content - In-page navigation (especially jump links to and from footnotes) - Table of contents when needed, in a disclosure element - Custom navigation to group a series of posts - Markers for external links - Captions for images and embeds - Disclosure elements for extra context - Footnotes (with links back to the referring text) - Index pages with summaries (the main blog index, and each tag's index) - RSS feed (global) So far I'm reasonably happy with things as they are.

And do you think each post/article should have footnotes? reply input_sh 2 hours agorootparentSidenotes can't be on the side on a small screen. You have to put them in between paragraphs, at which point they stop being sidenotes and just become part of the text. Then, how do you handle them in your RSS feed? What happens if the reader clicks on the reader view button in their browser? Footnotes always remain footnotes, regardless of all of that. reply voidUpdate 8 hours agoprevMaybe it's just me, but I'm not so much of a fan of Dialogs as demonstrated here, especially when there are a lot of characters, each of which have a different role that is only communicated by going to a separate page to read about them. If I wanted to explain something in an article I was writing, I would just explain it in the same way I'd do everything else, with a separate paragraph, maybe with some links to relevant sources that I used to become familiar with the topic too reply WorldMaker 1 hour agoparentDialogs are definitely an interesting form of writing, especially for technical writing. On the one hand, it's a deeply natural format with a long and complex history (the Socratic Method, especially, but certainly not alone). On the other hand, we've long disassociated it from \"professional writing\" which is to supposed to only have one proscribed argument and one direct viewpoint (likely, but not always, the author's). Somewhere in the middle, is decades of the \"…for Dummies\" technical manual formula and its stock dialog characters and the love affair many had (or still have) with \"The Poignant Guide to Ruby\". Dialogs can definitely be hard to read in the context of just reading a single blog post because you don't have a familiarity with that author's characters and most blog authors don't have a \"shared universe\" of characters. I wonder if there's an interesting world where for instance the Dummies characters were considered to be public domain at the right time or more blog writers felt confident with _why's unique voices to turn Poignant's characters into a modern \"Punch & Judy\" for technical writing. The Socratic Method worked because everyone had a shared intuition on the characters of the day (in part because many were famous Senators and/or Wrestlers): Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, etc. (Also, Plato was his wrestling name, these were absolutely characters.) Maybe if we want to use more Dialogs in blog posts easily we need better shared characters? reply dcminter 7 hours agoparentprevIt takes a lot of skill on the part of the author - I don't think I'd risk it personally. But I like the way it's handled on fasterthanli.me enormously - the author there successfully anticipates a lot of my \"wait, but...\" thoughts and addresses them directly via this mechanism, or, conversely, makes me realise that I ought to have had an objection to the point they're making. reply voidUpdate 7 hours agorootparentI've just read a couple of their articles, and I think an aside works nicely, just a note about something, but a full on dialog is a bit much.

I'd always thought that inline dialogs with fictional characters were more for the author's entertainment than the reader's, so I was surprised OP and others in the thread like them. I have nothing against them if people like them; just a matter of taste. reply layer8 1 hour agoparentprevAgreed. I can rarely identify with the character(s) I’m supposed to identify with, and it’s virtually always a tedious read.

Regarding the Table of Contents feature, however, I believe this makes a big difference in larger blogs, but for medium sized or smaller blogs, it can be a distractor. I use Hugo as well for compositing my site, and find that using ample first level headings (e.g., # Heading name) for major components alongside a solid flow that contains visual graphics placed shortly after the heading offers an attractive and easy-to-navigate browsing experience. reply kqr 6 hours agoparentTables of contents are tricky. My publishing logic is rather flexible in how I use them, so I used to put them into the margins of longer articles[1] and sometimes even shorter ones[2] although I wasn't great at always remembering to do it[3]. But the problem for me is that good headlines, that give a fair summary of the section they are for, make for really wide tables of contents which don't fit neatly into the margins[4], so sometimes the table of content has to occupy space in the main section[5] which seems to me like it distracts a bit from the actual content.

It tries to separate the readers to two groups---one who wants more details and the other who doesn't, but the problem is that there's no such natural division. When I read articles with side notes, I often find myself constantly checking the side notes and then regret doing it because the info is unnecessary. I prefer the author to carefully think through and choose what info to present instead of just dumping info to the side notes. reply digging 1 hour agoparentI think that just means the author is writing bad side notes. Structurally, they do have a place. You said that yourself - \"I do like to see details and I'm curious\". An author moving all their side notes into the main content would not make it clearer. An author deleting their useless side notes would make it clearer.

This is true for both footnote and side note, but for footnotes I can give it a glance to see if I want to read it thoroughly after reading the whole page, whereas for side notes, they are so easy and tempting to be seen. I feel the point of notes is that they do not interrupt the main flow but side notes put them on almost equal footing in terms of attracting attention as the main content. Besides, footnote/side notes should be kept minimal, otherwise the note becomes the main content. I find articles with side notes often overuse them. Yeah, if they are kept minimal I guess both approaches are fine. reply 082349872349872 1 hour agorootparent> otherwise the note becomes the main content.

The footnote pop-up bubble on substack can have the same problem. On a slow and unreliable connection, it's also one more thing that I wish had a toggle to turn off. Related to this, something I consider an anti-feature: any form of messing with a link to a different page that results in Control+Click not opening a new tab.

It's not uniformly used across all pages but I do like the format a lot. It's sort of an alternative to sidenotes but less disjoint where it treats the first part of a page as the intro and then expands in detail directions. It lets the intro be a higher-level and then \"corrected\" below. Example (just one I found, there are better ones but not all pages have them): https://mriquestions.com/how-to-reduce-sar.html Anyway just chiming in that it's a microfeature that I like vs say wikipedia which can just be... massively overwhelming on some pages. I don't necessarily think this feature is fully realized at mriquestions, but the MRI field suffers from multiple audiences (radiologists, technologists, engineers, etc) and its really difficult to pull content together that foster communication between these groups. mriquestions is by a radiologist so its a bit lacking on the engineering details side but its still pretty good but higher-level technologists use it well to get beyond the lies we tell them.

Alternate option is to have it next to every heading (ugly), turn every heading into a hyperlink without styling, or make them look like regular hyperlinks which I think is confusing. reply microflash 2 hours agoparentTry this. /* keep the icon hidden by default */ :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) .icon { visibility: hidden; } /* show the icon on focus and hover */ :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6):focus .icon, :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6):hover .icon { visibility: visible; } /* show the icon on devices that don't have any accessory that can hover */ @media (pointer: coarse), (any-hover: none) { :is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) .icon { visibility: visible; } } The `pointer: coarse` media query checks if you are using a device with an input mechanism of limited accuracy (such as fingers on a touchscreen). The `any-hover: none` media query checks if none of the input mechanisms on your device support hover (such as a Surface tablet not attached with a keyboard). reply kibwen 7 hours agoparentprevHave an icon appear on hover, and make every heading a hyperlink (even without styling), and have a table of contents with links to each heading (with styling).

I'm personally a huge fan of the progress meter (having once thought it was redundant as well) - one other easy addition I didn't see mentioned is an \"estimated reading time.\" Having a ballpark range for how long I should expect to spend with a piece of content greatly increases my chance of engaging with it, and the progress meter creates a tangible representation of that time (and how much of it I have left to finish consuming the content). reply swasheck 7 hours agorootparentin the early days of blogs, i found comments to be interesting and engaging dialogs. the last decade, or so, i’ve found comments to be unhelpful nitpicking/personal disagreements, spam, or support requests, so i’ve completely stopped concerning myself with comments on blogs. so i’ll agree that progress indicators are helpful for this use case. reply self_awareness 7 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure how \"estimated reading time\" works for non-english speakers.

Anyhow, as a non-native English speaker, it implemented it on my site by showing both the word count, as well as an estimated time, which is simply calculated by dividing the word count by a constant number of assumed words per minute. That number was guesstimated by doing some reading speed tests on myself and researching average reading speeds and rounding up to 10 wpm. I have to admit that my assumption of 240 words per minute does not hold up to any scientific scrutiny, but otoh it is an estimation. It works ok for prose.

Change the file extension on any page on my site from \".html\" to \".txt\" to view it as plain text (https://breckyunits.com/intelligence.txt). Makes it easy to copy/paste a whole post into an email or Reddit submission - View source links at the bottom of every page.

In addition to RSS, you can download my site as CSV (https://breckyunits.com/posts.csv). - Keyboard nav. Use the left/right arrow keys to navigate through pages on my site. - Helpful 404s.

Please don't, this is horrible and I've previously only seen it used by clickbait news sites. It provides no real value, the only use case of somebody wanting to browse through just the start of each of your articles is going to be incredibly rare. But what you're doing is hijacking a key that normally has no effect into having a destructive one. All it takes is a minor keyboard fumble while trying to scroll, and you've just lost all context and confusingly taken to some totally unrelated article. reply oneeyedpigeon 6 hours agorootparentI was thinking about this recently as I added it to a site. The use case is slightly different because the site in question was more data-driven than a blog. One example is viewing an individual item and being able to navigate to the next item in alphabetical order. This uses link elements with the appropriate rel values. The problem of losing context can be mitigated by having the page return to the previous location on back, something which browsers kinda already do, just not very well. Alternatively, I assume you'd prefer some kind of modifier? This has problems of its own — e.g. shortcut clashes. YouTube uses comma and full stop as frame next/previous shortcuts — maybe we should standardise on those? reply breck 7 hours agorootparentprevIn theory is the same as in practice, in theory.

Browsers still aren't the best at actually using that, but it's better than not hyphenating at all.

It's also why I like paragraphs to have some level of spacing between them. I'm currently reading a book that has quite minimal indentation on the first line of a paragraph, no spacing between, small font, and justified text. Every page is just a wall of text. It makes it noticeably more tiring to read than others that I've read recently. It seems to be a trend in more serious historical tomes. The last one I read, the Beauty and the Terror, was similarly typeset. It's one of the reasons I like reading on my kindle. reply hypertexthero 2 hours agorootparentprevYes! And lowercase letters are easier to read than ALL CAPITALIZED LETTERS IN A HORIZONTAL LINE OF TEXT. Justified text is the same thing, but vertically. Your eye reaches the end of the line, and the next one is likely slightly longer or shorter, so it is easier for your eyes to find the next line instead of reading the same line over again, and also easier to see the whole shape of a particular paragraph you want to refer to later. I do like well-hyphenated justified paragraphs in print, that also let you fit more words per page. But even there, I prefer the organic, non-uniform look of ragged text. reply mbforbes 5 hours agoparentprevAgreed! I wrote a blog post about this a couple years back.[1] A few things I think are going on: - layout and hyphenation algorithms on the web are worse (or often disabled!) - the lines are often too long - the site's margins aren't as strong as with print design These factors combine to produce the mess you're describing.

Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/Reuters Apple Apple found in breach of EU competition rules European Commission finds iPhone maker broke new laws designed to protect smaller competitors against big tech platforms Business live – latest updates Lisa O'Carroll Mon 24 Jun 2024 06.07 EDT Share Apple has been found to be in breach of sweeping new EU laws designed to allow smaller companies to compete and allow consumers to find cheaper and alternative apps in the tech business’s app store. The European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said it had sent its preliminary findings to Apple after an investigation launched in March. “For too long Apple has been squeezing out innovative companies — denying consumers new opportunities and choices,” said Thierry Breton, the European commissioner responsible for digital markets, on X. Brussels accuses Apple of breaking EU rules; UK facing rise in economic Misery Index – business live Read more In preliminary findings, against which Apple can appeal, the European Commission said it believed its rules of engagement did not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) “as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternatives channels for offers and content”. The company has 12 months to comply before it face fines of up to 10% of its global revenues but the EU hopes ongoing dialogue will lead to compliance rather than sanctions. In addition, the commission has opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns its new contract terms for third-party app developers also fall short of the DMA’s requirements. It is the third non-compliance investigation opened by the commission into Apple since the DMA came into force last year and the sixth launched in total, with two other inquiries outstanding into Google and one into Meta, the owner of Facebook. At the heart of Monday’s findings are three elements of Apple’s practices, including fees charged to app developers for every purchase made within seven days of linking out to the commercial app. The commission says a fee for such matchmaking is justifiable but what Apple charges goes “beyond what is strictly necessary”. In its preliminary findings on its earlier investigation, the EU has reiterated that the new digital laws require Apple to ensure that developers should be able “free of charge to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases”. As part of the new investigation, the commission is examining 0.50c charge, or “core technology fee”, Apple demands every time a developer’s app is installed on a phone. The allegations that Apple is breaking EU law are the first against a tech company under the DMA, landmark legislation introduced last August to ensure six designated “very large online platforms” including Google, Amazon, Meta and ByteDance (TikTok) compete fairly. The commission also found that Apple made it difficult for customers to find the pricing information, requiring them to “link out” to a webpage where a customer could then find the contract details. “If the commission’s preliminary views were to be ultimately confirmed, none of Apple’s three sets of business terms would comply with article 5(4) of the DMA, which requires gatekeepers to allow app developers to steer consumers to offers outside the gatekeepers’ app stores, free of charge,” the Commission said. The EU likened Monday’s preliminary findings to the halfway stage in a formal anti-trust investigation during which a company is shown a statement of objection and given time to rectify its anti-competitive practices. Apple said it had made a number of changes to comply with the DMA in the past few months in response to feedback from developers and the European Commission investigators. “We are confident our plan complies with the law, and estimate more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less in fees to Apple under the new business terms we created,” it said. “All developers doing business in the EU on the App Store have the opportunity to utilise the capabilities that we have introduced, including the ability to direct app users to the web to complete purchases at a very competitive rate. As we have done routinely, we will continue to listen and engage with the European Commission.” Explore more on these topics Apple Technology sector European Union Europe news Share Reuse this content",

It's insane that 1 company has near complete control over what software can and cannot be published, and they get to take a tax on all software sold. Absolutely insane. Obviously there's web, Android, Windows, Linux, gaming consoles, and smart tvs, so there are some work-arounds to avoid the evil empire, but most consumers here in the United States use iPhones and probably have no idea that Apple is taxing all of the app developers and exercising complete editorial control over all software published for the iPhone. Do you think consumers know that Apple literally reviews all software companies products and then decide whether they will allow that company or product to exist? Even worse, its not even high level executives making these decisions, it's $20 an hour employees on their App Review Board making these decisions to kill entire companies. reply EMIRELADERO 8 hours agoprevHere's some context which a lot of people, including most news media, seem to have missed: The reason Apple is still playing games with the EC is that they're waiting on an EU Court's ruling[1] on whether Article 6 (7), the provision that mandates free of charge iOS APIs for all developers, is \"constitutional\" within the EU framework itself. Most people who call out the Core Technology Fee use that provision as one of their main arguments, and it's one of their strongest, because the \"free of charge\" language throws away the general idea that the law doesn't want to interfere with Apple's monetization strategies. Since Apple could very well have chosen to monetize certain local API access in the past, the fact that this provision put a stop to that effectively nullifies Apple's argument (to the courts) that the law could never have meant to actually control how they make money.

If it is then malicious compliance basically boils down to, “No, not like that!” If a company is in compliance to the law and you don’t like the outcome the problem isn’t the company it is the law. The EU thinks Apple is not in compliance and Apple thinks it is. The court will decide which side is correct. If it turns out that Apple is in the right they will have complied with the law.

This is a discussion around legality, so it makes sense to keep the discussion in that context. Apple being able to do something undesirable, in the perspective in the intent of the law, is either a \"loophole\" in the law, or the law doesn't actually accomplish what it was made to.

AirBnB doesn't allow hosts to accept cash or arrange alternative payment. Amazon doesn't allow suppliers to offer direct sales to potential customers. Even Visa and Mastercard officially don't allow merchants to offer discounts for cash transactions (although many do anyway). Etc, etc. I think this should be a more general rule, no \"platform\" or \"aggregator\" should be allowed to prevent the free communication of users of their platform from arranging their deal elsewhere. Just because they met on the platform doesn't give the right to the platform to strong-arm their users into using them. The platform must compete with alternative payment methods on its own merits, such as convenience, security, etc., not by forcing people to use them just because they happen to be the matchmaker.

If I didn't like AirBNB I could use VRBO/whatever else, or I could use both even. I can understand Apple's cut for app developers who solely create apps and distribute them through Apple. Where it becomes a problem is a large number of apps are just a way for the iPhone to connect to a larger product (Spotify, Basecamp, most SaaS companies), and I don't know why Apple should feel entitled to own the relationship with a businesses customers because they also use an iPhone when it's an ancillary part of the product. reply indoordin0saur 50 minutes agoparentprevThe move is to create a closed-market and then collect rent.

The CTF applies to anyone with business revenue who meets the install requirements, even if you're not charging for that specific app. Development apps are time limited by Apple's terms.

Apple is essentially being benevolent, not saying they have no claim to the transactions. reply ak217 4 hours agoparentprevIt's not really standard and I think the comparisons don't quite work. In Airbnb's case, Apple's policy is comparable to forbidding hosts from offering extra services (not related to lodging) to users off-platform once they begin their stay. In Amazon's case, it's like if Amazon banned manufacturers from including coupons for future direct purchases in the product packaging. In Visa and Mastercard's case, it's like banning merchants from mentioning other payment methods at all. I think it's abuse and I agree it should be forbidden as a class of behaviors. I would love to see Apple fined enough to deter anyone from trying what they did with Epic ever again. reply tpmoney 3 hours agoparentprevOn the other hand a mechanism of a number of online market place scams is to gain customers trading on the “security” (such as it is) of the market place, and then directing the customer out of the market place. Everyone (should) know that any eBay seller that tries to get you to complete the auction outside of eBay is likely to be a scam. Likewise I would hope anyone would be leery of placing an order on Amazon and having a seller contact you asking you to cancel that order and buy it cheaper on some other website. Reputation matters for consumers, and legitimate sellers rely on the market place’s good reputation to help smooth the sales process. Scammers do too, but their goal is to get you out of the market place ASAP where the rules and regulations are harder to get enforced. Companies like Apple and eBay have a strong incentive to have a trustable pipeline and mandate sellers to use it because even though they’re not the ones perpetuating the scam, being known as a market place where scammers hang out is damaging. Consider this, between the Apple Store, eBay and Craigslist, what order would you place those market places if ranking your level of trust for not getting scammed when providing your payment details for a recurring subscription to a random seller? Or put another way, even though it’s free and plenty of smaller companies do, Netflix doesn’t make posts of Craigslist advertising their services. There’s obviously many reasons for that, but at least part of it I’m sure is no one should trust a random link in a Craigslist post to a Netflix sign up site. reply penguinbasher 8 hours agoprevApple's app-store policies are anti-competitive. Even though they recently 'allowed' (How kind of them) publishers to create a link to an external form of payment, where the offer may be better, Apple still demands a significant slice of commission. I think many users would continue to use in-app purchases as it is a convenient way to pay, but the actions from Apple are poor and heavily restrictive. To save yourself some money, if subscribing, always go to the website, you'll get a better offer than within the app and more of your money will go to the publisher. reply biztos 5 hours agoparentThere are apps on the App Store in which the only way to pay is by entering your credit card info in the app. Others that link out to bank processing sites in a web view to do the same. This has been true for at least ten years, and the number is not getting smaller as far as I can tell. As a user of some of these apps, I have always wondered whether there is some exception clause for, say, retailers of physical goods, utilities, and anything remotely to do with transportation. My anecdata suggests it’s more common in the EU and Asia, but a year and a half ago I was standing by the curb in Sacramento cursing the parking meter app for not taking Apple Pay. reply madeofpalk 4 hours agorootparenthttps://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#per... > 3.1.3(d) Person-to-Person Services: If your app enables the purchase of real-time person-to-person services between two individuals (for example tutoring students, medical consultations, real estate tours, or fitness training), you may use purchase methods other than in-app purchase to collect those payments. One-to-few and one-to-many real-time services must use in-app purchase. > 3.1.3(e) Goods and Services Outside of the App: If your app enables people to purchase physical goods or services that will be consumed outside of the app, you must use purchase methods other than in-app purchase to collect those payments, such as Apple Pay or traditional credit card entry. reply biztos 4 hours agorootparentThanks, that clears it up I think! reply sem000 8 hours agoparentprevThis forum will never understand is that 95% of Apple users DO NOT want to go to a random website and download to save a few bucks. If they were interested in saving a few bucks, they would be using Androids. Why can this not be comprehended by a forum of such intellect? We don’t care about the fees, and the hoops Apple makes developers jump through, because before Apple everything was download, pay and pray. reply alkonaut 7 hours agorootparentI absolutely do NOT want to download/sideload anything from a third party. You are absolutely correct there. Not even from companies I trust (e.g. I wouldn't want to download the Netflix app from Netflix) - I DO want apple to spend as much money and effort as they do now on vetting apps. - I DO realize that means they must grab some money, somwhere. - I DO NOT want apple to take a cut out of subscriptions for services. It's as simple as that. There is zero way in hell that apple should have a cut out of subscription services. I should be able to pay any way I want for e.g. podcasts, and Apple should just suck it up and charge $25 from the distributor, once, for reviewing the podcast app. Basically: Apple needs to just give up their golden egg, run the app store at minium profit, and I hope the EU breaks their kneecaps if they don't swiftly agree to do so. reply Arkhaine_kupo 7 hours agorootparentIf the app you downloaded has an update, does the app not need to be revised again? Why would the revision fee not happen with every update? Would that not mean developers that update more and get better value for their customers are penalised? Subscription cuts strikes a happy medium, where apple gets paid when the company gets paid, so if they deliver more features they are not penalised but they are also not allowed to update for free forever (potentially adding malicious code without anyone checking due to only being checked the first time they paid). reply alkonaut 3 hours agorootparent> Why would the revision fee not happen with every update? It would. So charge $25 again. So long as they charge what their actual cost is (with a reasonable margin) that's fine. But that's a universe apart from charging 10% of the profits of some streaming service because you \"provide the platform\". reply jeffhuys 3 hours agorootparentThat would actually be pretty nice; devs would maybe not update every day but once a month or something, and have actual changelogs, AND the review queue would be way shorter. reply Workaccount2 5 hours agorootparentprevOk, well Apple can keep their model, but they must allow alternate app stores onto iPhones. If consumers want to pay for Apple's premium services, they can just stick to the default. If they want stuff cheaper, they can try an app store willing to only make a 10% margin instead of Apple's 40%. reply threeseed 7 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is you have a misunderstanding of what the fee is. From Apple's perspective it includes the ongoing cost of providing all of the SDKs i.e. CTF. reply enragedcacti 2 hours agorootparentFrom a user's perspective it wouldn't be a phone worth buying if those SDKs weren't provided. Why do we have to accept Apple's framing that SDKs are a gift bestowed upon developers rather than an essential part of the software ecosystem that users are buying into? Third party apps can't exist without the SDK, but the iPhone wouldn't be viable without third party apps. Who makes money in this arrangement has nothing to do with what's fair and everything to do with who has more power. reply archagon 2 hours agorootparentprevThen why isn’t there one on macOS? I get the feeling that the CTF exists more to dissuade developers from building for alt app stores. reply jsnell 8 hours agorootparentprevYour rant seems misguided, given you're talking about \"downloads\". The GP wasn't talking about downloading apps from outside the App Store, it was about Apple's anti-steering rules within the App Store But in either case, if the user sentiment is as strong as you claim, Apple has nothing to lose in following the laws. The users will continue to demand installs and payments go via the App Store, and developers will have to continue providing that option or lose customers. Why do you feel so threatened by these laws? It sounds like you don't really have the confidence in 95% of the users agreeing with you. reply tikkabhuna 8 hours agorootparentprevThat should be an informed decision. If users are happy to pay extra to Apple for convenience of use, then they should be aware of what is happening. If 95%, like you say, are happy to pay extra, then it should be no problem for Apple to allow developers to communicate the Apple fees. reply madeofpalk 8 hours agorootparentIf users don't want to go to other websites, then developers should notice they're losing sales and be incentivised to offer a more convenient option! Maybe over time more integrated options could emergy that's as convenient, offers more features, and could be cheaper. Imagine if there was competition! reply gbalduzzi 8 hours agorootparentprevOk, fair. Then allow app developers to explain this in the app and provide a link to the external website and let the user decide what they prefer. The issue is that you can't publish an app unless you hide this information from the user and as a consequence most users aren't even aware that alternatives exists. Let the user freely decide and you can't charge how much you want for the convenience of your service, even more than 30%, nobody would care. reply graemep 8 hours agorootparentprev> This forum will never understand is that 95% of Apple users DO NOT want to go to a random website and download to save a few bucks Who said they will download from a random website, or that the only advantage is to save a few bucks?

Apple prevents developers from saying that Apple takes a % cut of the sale. Apple prevents developers from saying its available cheaper elsewhere. If Apple feels these rules are so just and fair and indispuitably correct, why does it go to such measures to hide them from its consumers? Consistently these anti-steering rules are what gets Apple in trouble all around the world. It's the one part Apple lost in the US Epic case, and it's the EUs first point on their breach. Apple has done this to themselves by being so stubborn and refusing to budge an inch on how they run their platforms. The tiniest concession years ago could have avoided all this regulation on them. reply ankit219 8 hours agoparentHave they ever specified any reason why they prevent users from finding this out? I read somewhere (I think Epic v Apple) where the judge surmised that App store model was not just payments but the whole mechanism of tracking subscriptions, cancel and refunds, and standard pricing for purchases. I can understand the viewpoint that Apple customers might expect the same functionality if they purchase directly on site. But then, let the developer explain that too. \"You can get this cheaper on website, but will no longer be able to cancel via App Store\" is a fair enough line that can be mandated just like they mandated everything else. Think they will have to do away with it eventually, though from the outside it looks like they think if they drag their feet on this, maybe regulators won't come for other things. reply rekoil 7 hours agorootparentThey could also provide developers some APIs to register external subscriptions and purchases, and thus make cancellation and refunds available through centralised user interfaces within iOS, but they don't, because their goal isn't actually to create great products for their customers, it's to create value for shareholders, and they can more easily do that by locking users into their model. reply IMTDb 6 hours agorootparentAs a user I really like the fact that Apple is the only one with my payment informations. I can safely install any app that I want, get subscription, in-apps etc without ever having to wonder where my payment informations are going. You can't have that level of safety with API. Nothing prevents a dev from building an API that returns always \"200 OK\" when being called for a \"terminate subscription\" action, but that does nothing under the hood. If I unsubscribe from an Apple provided UI, I will hold Apple responsible for the execution of the action. Apple works really really hard to make sure that this trust we have in their system is warranted. As we know, trust is hard-earned, easily lost, and difficult to reestablish. So all it takes is a single bad experience to make me doubt everything else. The current system allows Apple to control 100% of the process and to be fully responsible for everything. That being said, Apple should allow users to perform all these operations outside of the iOS ecosystem if the developer allows it. I feel there is a clear communication here that \"anything done outside of the Apple UI's is not the responsibility of Apple\" (including payment / subscription management). reply viraptor 6 hours agorootparent> I will hold Apple responsible for the execution of the action. How do you think you'll do that? And then, how would it be different than with an app developer? When this happens for example https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254901336 and you don't have another Apple device available. I can dispute a card transaction, cancel a payment, maybe even send a nastygram to a developer.

Apple couldn't explain it or provide any insight whatsoever. Nothing. Apparently, the charges were on her credit card but associated with another Apple ID. We did a charge back which was successful. Now, I'm just waiting for the inevitable locking of her Apple ID. Luckily, she has already created a new one, but if the same thing happened to me I'd be in serious trouble. In my case, simply creating a new Apple ID is not an option. It's really scary. reply ToucanLoucan 5 hours agorootparentprevI mean, canceling a check costs money, and a charge-back (or perhaps more accurately rephrased, the request for a charge-back) on a credit card can be declined by the financial institution if they don't believe it's the correct action, and they'll usually ask you to work with the merchant first. I'm not saying the middlemen you mention there are beyond reproach, merely pointing out the alternative systems that are implied here to be more/perfectly effective aren't exactly that either. reply darreninthenet 2 hours agorootparentThe behaviour of a credit card company would vary enormously around the world though, for example in the UK credit card providers are jointly and severely liable for any action brought against the merchant (ie if they won't do anything you take both them and (eg) Apple to court) so they tend to be far more responsive to consumer complaints. reply alt227 4 hours agorootparentprevI think youve missed the parents point. They are saying the middleman gatekeepers are dangerous becasue if you push them too hard they can take away your access to everything. Whereas if your agreements are with the individual companies and developers then the worst they can do is take away that one app. reply naravara 3 hours agorootparentOn the other hand, those middlemen gatekeepers also make it a big part of their value addition to me, as a customer, to throw their weight around in my favor against all the other companies I can’t be arsed to argue with. For example, one of the reasons people pay for that AmEx Platinum card or Sapphire Reserve is specifically because you can call in the lender to do chargebacks, and the merchants themselves know that if they get too many complaints filed against them the financial institution will visit consequences on them. I view Apple in much the same way. I don’t trust most developers, and part of what makes me willing to go out on a limb and throw a bit of money their way is the knowledge that I’m not gonna have to go through a whole path of dark pattern bullshit when I want to modify or cancel my subscription. reply freeAgent 3 hours agorootparentGoogle threatened to end my access to their payments system, which at the time would have caused my Google Fi phone plan to be unpayable, because they refuse to acknowledge a fraudulent charge through some Google Wallet apparently/maybe physical card at Forever 21's Indian affiliate for like $20 or $25. I have never, ever shopped at Forever 21 and didn't ever have a physical Google Wallet card. The charge was obviously fraudulent, but Google refused to help (and I also couldn't get anything particularly useful from Forever 21 other than to confirm that they hadn't integrated Google's payment method directly, so it must have been a physical card). So I disputed the charge with my real bank, which corrected the problem by refunding me. Google told me that if I ever did that again, they would lock me out of not just my account, but any future account using Google payment methods that was linked to me. That would make my phone service and the Google Play Store unusable. That was the beginning of the end of my relationship with Google services.

But I have a feeling if a credit card issuer believes you are abusing their charge-back system, they might well nuke your account there too. reply toast0 3 hours agorootparentIf a credit card issuer drops your account, you don't lose access to things you paid for with the card.

There are no other companies you can go to to get an app on your iphone. reply immibis 4 hours agorootparentprevIf the charge back is approved, by definition it's not abuse, and the issuer makes money on successful chargebacks. They also make money on you having an account there. And they have the responsibility to give your money back if they close it. Plus you're ultimately, if indirectly, backed up by the full power of the civil justice system, courts and judges and all that.

Yes, that exactly what I’m saying. Apple won (clearly because of the merits of their products) and now they can squeeze developers and consumers to a very high degree without any negative consequences. That’s how monopolies (of course it’s scale, Apple is not literally a monopoly, for that matter neither was Standard Oil back in 1906, they had a comparable market share to Apple these days) work regardless of how exactly they became one, they get to keep all the market surplus that would go to consumers in a more competitive market. reply HDThoreaun 1 hour agorootparentprevNo, most people still do not know about how onerous the App Store rules are. reply willseth 2 hours agorootparentprev> \"You can get this cheaper on website, but will no longer be able to cancel via App Store\" This seems like a reasonable compromise.

The reason is that every major retailer has anti-steering or most favored nation agreements with their suppliers, and Apple thinks they shouldn't be banned from it when everyone else does it. Applied to physical retail it does seem pretty absurd, e.g. The Cuisinart blender box at Target says it's 10% cheaper at Wal-Mart. reply tomxor 1 hour agorootparentWalmart isn't a gatekeeper because it doesn't make one of the most popular platforms on the planet. If apple want to give up platform ownership and be a retailer, the EU wont have any complaints about them not allowing steering in their app store. Meanwhile Apple's app store would become one of many options rather than the default and only, so steering is moot. Obviously that's not going to happen, hence they are going to have to hash it out until it's not longer anti competitive or be broken up forcefully. reply willseth 40 minutes agorootparentMy point was that the idea of anti-steering in retail is old and the idea of \"gatekeepers\" is new. Apple isn't unique. They are behaving exactly how you would expect if a regulator suddenly tries to stop them from doing something that was previously routine. reply thayne 42 minutes agorootparentprev> The reason is that every major retailer has anti-steering or most favored nation agreements with their suppliers Well, I don't think that should be allowed either. Especially when the retailer has enough market power that they can bully the supplier into accepting unfavorable terms, like say Amazon or Wal-Mart. If a retailer takes a bigger cut, it shouldn't forbid you from selling it cheaper elsewhere. reply araes 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's close to that, and if Apple was forced to advertise the cheaper price, or the product seller themselves was then it would be. This is more like Target prohibits sellers from ever notifying you that there's a sales price at Walmart if you're looking for a deal. You're not allowed to push deals for you're own product during Black Friday or similar. Frankly. I donno where the quote about the \"do not tell about sales is at.\" I tried to read the legalese and got stuck on: 7.3 \"You may also distribute Your Applications ... within Your company, ... on a limited number of Registered Devices (as specified in the Program web portal)\" Wait. What? My own company has limited internal distribution on my own app? 7.6 \"Except for the distribution of ...

In such cases regulations are to prevent such companies from having too much influence and bottlenecking everything else with high prices or forcing their own other products. EU already did this with credit cards. reply DarkNova6 7 hours agorootparentOr you force and open standard and now you have different companies using the same system but with competing pricing.

Some of them you insert the card, some use NFC, some you scan a QR Code, some you show a QR code. Some have had big discounts or \"points\", probably to try to get market share.

There was a time when common wisdom was that telephone companies and many other infrastructure businesses needed to “obviously” be monopolies as well (sometimes state-owned, sometimes private, which is arguably the worst of both worlds). I really wouldn’t want to go back to that. reply Jensson 6 hours agorootparent> That’s arguably not a great example, since there are both more than one international credit/debit card networks, and even these have been subject to constant regulatory scrutiny. The two cards are essentially interchangeable so it is a duopoly. And the fact that they are subject to constant regulatory scrutiny without adding laws to force new entrants is why it is such a good example, it shows how well regulations can work without adding competition. To me in Europe credit cards works really great with low fees and no fuzz, I don't think that anything needs to be done about that more than is already done. reply lxgr 5 hours agorootparentTo card issuing banks, absolutely not. Visa and Mastercard compete for their business. To merchants, yes, since they can't reasonably only accept one but not the other, as that would turn away a large fraction of their customer base. This is why most regulatory action happens here. > subject to constant regulatory scrutiny without adding laws to force new entrants There are absolutely measures taken to encourage new market entrants or at least more competition among the existing ones. (Whether they are effective is a different question.) As one example, in the US, every debit card issuer is obliged to add at least one other brand/network to their cards, so that merchants do in fact have some routing choice. In Europe, some countries also have a domestic competing debit scheme, such as CB in France, Girocard in Germany etc. > I don't think that anything needs to be done about that more than is already done.

This is also why Nintendo (when they moved into video games) set up their business model as platform-holder, not just game developer. And their own games are primarily there to seed the platform. reply yobbo 7 hours agorootparentRather, the goal was to lower (\"subsidise\") the purchase price (initial barrier) of the NES/SNES and then recoup it on licenses for cartridges.

But Apple is not subsidising phones in any way. reply aikinai 6 hours agorootparentI'm not sure how you're framing that as a subsidy. It's a killer app that gets people over the threshold to purchase the platform (console). And then once the install base is established, everyone else wants to make their own games and has to pay you (a lot) for the privilege. Developing first-party games costs more money, to both Nintendo and consumers, so it's the opposite of a subsidy.

Losing Europe as a market would have larger consequences, though.

That's not a real risk. I work in Europe and the people I know commonly switch between WhatsApp, iMessage, and Signal. I still use the Apple messenger by default because it is a noticeably superior product to the other two. Similarly, my experience is that software produced in the EU commonly has worse support on Apple, including at companies I worked for. Again, that's already the reality. This fact was sometimes raised as a reason the apps had difficulty getting traction in iPhone heavy markets like the US. There are reasons for Apple to stay in Europe but these aren't the reasons. I've commonly observed that the iPhone is more of a status symbol in Europe than in the US (where it is usually just the phone most people buy by default), which creates different market dynamics.

The word \"humane\", in my view, defines how we would like to be, not how we really are. reply LocalH 6 hours agorootparentShip of Theseus. If you replace every single human at Apple with someone different, it's still Apple. Apple is, at this point, a separate entity, under control by a given group of humans at a given time, but that can change. The problem is considering \"Apple\" itself a person, as corporate personhood does. Thinking of companies, even in limited contexts, as a \"person\" allows the individuals actually making decisions to be largely immune from liability on a personal level. Maybe that should change. reply chgs 7 hours agorootparentprevApple is more than the sum of its parts. Technically a person is just a bunch of cells, but those cells are interchangable, replaceable (indeed few last more than a couple of decades), and if you lose an individual cell nothing happens to the person, but the cell can’t function. we don’t say the cells make decisions, we say people do. With a corporation it’s the corporation that makes the decisions, not the individual cells. reply nickserv 6 hours agorootparentAgreed, there's definitely the emergence principle at work when looking at how groups of people function. The population of a city or a nation is similarly greater than the sum of its parts, and there is an emergent property in both cases. Same as an ant colony. 2 things though. The constituant parts of a corporation are human, unlike an ant colony. So in that sense they are human, and ant colonies are ant. Regarding ourselves, we absolutely are an assembly of cells, it wouldn't be wrong to define us as such, although not terribly convenient. But interchangeable the cells are not, well not like a person to a corporation. A cell can't move from one person to another, if it somehow disagreed with a decision of the central nervous system. The human brain is made up of billions of cells, and decisions of the brain are heavily dictated by the digestive system and various hormones. A corporate board is at the most, what, maybe a few dozen people? There isn't the same level of responsibility of each component. Finally, if the entire corporation decides as one entity, how to punish for wrongdoing? Should every component of the corporation be put in jail if the corporation kills people (looking at you Boeing), or just the humans at the top that made those decisions? Another way of looking at it: Is the entirety of the Palestinian population responsible for the decisions of the dozens of humans that are the Hamas leadership? reply BriggyDwiggs42 2 hours agorootparentThe decision makers still have agency, but structures exist to prevent those who would make un-profitable decisions from reaching the top of the corporation in the first place. Once they’re there, their choices are constrained somewhat and (with nuances) profitable decisions are incentivized over others. The consequence is that, while individuals possess agency, we can also observe that the average individual’s behavior is predictable and in service of the corporate machine in aggregate. You can punish the ghoulish person who decided, along with a few others, to dump toxic waste into the river, while still recognizing that their actions were an inevitable result of the incentives we created for them. The most productive thing, of course, would be to change the incentives, but baby steps. reply robertlagrant 6 hours agorootparentprevYour way of thinking advocates for no accountability by employees. The company did it? reply BriggyDwiggs42 2 hours agorootparentprevLooking at a corporation as a single entity from the outside it seems more like some sociopathic, mildly superhuman ai than a group of people.

That's why I didn't say \"are culpable differently\" but \"behave differently\". reply DiggyJohnson 4 hours agorootparentprevOne of HN's biggest intellectual blind spots is mistaking explanation with justification. Looks like your comment was caught up in that. reply stoperaticless 8 hours agorootparentprevI don’t see the future, but argument for Apple could go like this: - it is Apple vs EU - US gov has guns and influence and various levers - US gov will definitely protect Apple from guns of EU (so regulator with guns is a bit mute point) - Apple is important to americans (I think they feel it’s their symbol or something), so officials in US gov might think it’s good opportunity to grab some political points. - US gov might act to help out Apple in this dispute (Nothing like a war, but some slight nod or handshake; maybe via diplomatic backwater; maybe in exchange for something) Though most probably apple will give “something” even if minor change in the rules, at least just so EU would not loose face, to keep relationship friendly.

The US might act in various ways to protect American manufacturers, or oil industry, or other industries that are responsible for a lot of jobs in the US or are a strategic resource in some other way. See the 100% tax import for Chinese EVs. The US government doesn't care about Apple. Apple's economic impact is basically irrelevant for the US, because it doesn't provide a noteworthy number of jobs or any significant supply chain within the US. Apple's use as a strategic resource is completely irrelevant based on their antagonistic behavior towards the US government and they've shown themselves to be as eager to comply with Chinese laws as they are to flout US government policies. I'd maybe see the US do something to protect Microsoft, with its deep ties to the military industrial complex, or Intel, which has both these ties and is clearly a strategic resource because of the advanced chips it provides, but really only if there were an existential threat that would also prevent Microsoft or Intel from performing their necessary roles in the US economy, the military and in US foreign policy. But to suggest that US guns are in any way relevant, or that the US would bother trying to protect Apple, is frankly absurd. The EU has smacked down Meta, Google and Microsoft already for things they felt were anti-competitive. The US didn't give a shit.

Most Mac apps are distributed outside of the app store, some aren't even notarized. reply mgrandl 3 hours agorootparentYes because developers don’t want to pay $100 to then go through a super annoying notarization process to distribute their FOSS app. reply kube-system 1 hour agorootparentprevThe desktop is kind of a different space, though. Most of the paid apps I've ever used on MacOS are well-known and cross-platform -- the kind of thing where you'd go to the developers website directly by name. So, of course the developer is going to guide those people down a path where they get all the revenue. And the users of FOSS apps are overwhelmingly the people who will download a DMG from GitHub releases, and change their security settings to install it -- so why bother? But for everyone else -- the $4.99 apps that aren't household names -- the App Store is probably where these are most often purchased. Although I doubt this market is very large on the desktop -- most people just use a browser and maybe some well known software that would have come in a box 20 years ago. reply YetAnotherNick 2 hours agorootparentprevAndroid is the more closer to iOS example though. They have alt store and you can also download app through chrome, yet most users only use Google's play store. reply wongarsu 1 hour agorootparent* Most users only use Google's play store, except for apps not available there Certain categories of apps aren't deemed acceptable by Google (e.g. apps with adult content, apps that circumvent copyright, some \"hacking\" apps, etc).

According to some for every one purchase ten people use a pirated version. reply burnerthrow008 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, it is! Look at how much smaller MacOS market share is compared to iOS in their respective markets. Stated preference vs. revealed preference. reply grishka 3 hours agorootparentUS and Japan are the two unusual countries where iOS has more market share than Android. In the rest of the world, iOS is maybe 20%. For computers the situation is exacerbated by the fact that many people own one mostly for gaming, which means it's going to be Windows.

The app store isn't just about making more money, it's about enforcing privacy and security guidelines for apps through the review process and through checks for unauthorized api usage. Apple's product is privacy; they view privacy as a premium feature worth paying for, and 3rd party app stores that are the wild west for privacy are antithetical to this. reply luyu_wu 3 hours agorootparentSaid customers who care about privacy would therefore continue to use the App Store. reply detourdog 2 hours agorootparentWhy should Apple divert resources creating a secondary environment? reply jiveturkey 2 hours agorootparentprevwhich is about brand marketing, which is about making more money. without the differentiation of the app store, they are that much closer to being android. > Apple's product is privacy that's a large component of their brand, not their product. for contrast, signal's product is privacy. (note: i'm no fan of signal) consider that the facebook app is allowed, on the first party app store. i'm failing to see how the app store gates privacy. reply toasterlovin 6 hours agoparentprevAnti-steering rules are completely normal in contracts between cooperating commercial entities. We sell on Amazon and we’re not allowed to steer Amazon’s customers off of Amazon. Amazon disables hyperlinks in the messaging system for communicating with customers. They rejected our PDF spec sheets for having links to our website. They will de-list our products if they’re available for a lower price on another site. And, honestly, they’re completely justified, IMO. They’ve done all the work of furnishing a customer who is ready to purchase. Why should they then have to allow us to steer that customer off of their site to complete the sale? Of course, we’re still allowed to sell outside of Amazon, but we have to do all the legwork to get customers. And, being in the midst of an effort to do just that, it’s a huge amount of work, so I think they’re justified in not wanting us to poach their customers. reply pjc50 3 hours agorootparentI remember hearing stories of customers flicking through physical books in bookstores and then buying them off Amazon. Can't do anti-steering in that direction. > They rejected our PDF spec sheets for having links to our website. I miss the world wide web where you could link to sites. > They will de-list our products if they’re available for a lower price on another site. This is straight up cartelization and can no longer be called a \"market\". reply jpollock 2 hours agorootparentIt's important to get the analogies close. The bookstore isn't the same. It would be if the book had a QR code on the back labeled \"guaranteed cheaper here\" - not just the UPC/ISBN. The customer is choosing to price compare somewhere else, that's not steering, that's brand loyalty. reply AlexandrB 1 hour agorootparentWasn't this literally a feature of the Amazon app? You could scan a book's UPC and have it pull up the Amazon listing. reply jpollock 58 minutes agorootparentSure, but that's _still_ customer brand loyalty. The _book_ isn't advertising \"Go to Amazon for the cheapest prices\" on the cover. reply tikkabhuna 5 hours agorootparentprev> They’ve done all the work of furnishing a customer who is ready to purchase. But Apple aren't doing that, really. If I find a link to an App Store app on a website and install it via App Store (as that's the only option), Apple have put no effort into finding a customer. In fact, they've injected themselves into the process by requiring apps come via the App Store. reply toasterlovin 48 minutes agorootparentNo they haven't? An app can sell a customer access to their app outside the App Store, give them an account that they can use to access full functionality, direct them to the App Store to download the app, and Apple doesn't take anything. Apple gets a cut when they facilitate the sale, which they absolutely do when a customer is directed to the app in the App Store and then can buy the app with a single tap (knowing it has undergone some degree of vetting and that they can get a refund if they're not happy). If you don't think that is providing immense value, then just consider the difficulty of selling software outside of the App Store. To an approximation, it basically doesn't happen except with B2B SaaS (which notoriously requires a very expensive sales and marketing function). reply detourdog 2 hours agorootparentprevThe developer could probably sell them same app service directly through a webpage and use that in the advertisement link instead of the App Store link. reply poincaredisk 6 hours agorootparentprevI understand why Amazon won't allow you to link to your store directly but >They will de-list our products if they’re available for a lower price on another site. This sounds pretty shady reply _aavaa_ 4 hours agorootparentNot only are they shady, but these most favoured nation deals are incredibly anti competitive. Amazon is using its market position to dictate what price other stores are allowed to sell at. reply toasterlovin 40 minutes agorootparentThey're just not. The thing they're trying to avoid is a customer discovering a product on Amazon, then immediately finding it for less on the manufacturer's website. And this happens. We do it! So do plenty of other sellers we're aware of. Of course, we have to hide it behind a login or offer a 10% discount on first order or whatever. Amazon is giving sellers something of immense value (the opportunity to sell physical goods to a huge pool of customers who are ready to buy). Why should Amazon give that access to sellers who are trying to divert customers off of Amazon? They're not running a charity. It's their business, which they've built over decades of immense investment and effort. And the immense value of what they've built is evident in the difficulty other massive retailers like Walmart, Target, Kroger, etc. are having building similar online retail businesses. reply petre 1 hour agorootparentprevNot only they do that but they also give out deals and rebates without asking the merchant. I would automatically give the clients a rebate equal to the Amazon fees if they purchased through my site. reply toasterlovin 6 hours agorootparentprevWe don’t have a right to sell on their site.

Share Print Washington — U.S. prosecutors are recommending to senior Justice Department officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing after finding the planemaker violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Justice Department (DOJ) must decide by July 7 whether to prosecute Boeing. The recommendation of prosecutors handling the case has not been previously reported. In May, officials determined the company breached a 2021 agreement that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 MAX jet. Under the 2021 deal, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute Boeing over allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration so long as the company overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation. Boeing declined to comment. It has previously said it has \"honored the terms\" of the 2021 settlement, which had a three-year term and is known as a deferred prosecution agreement. Boeing has told the Justice Department it disagrees with its determination that the company violated the settlement, Reuters reported this month. A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the Justice Department's investigation and there is no guarantee officials will move forward with charges, the two sources said. The internal Justice Department deliberations remain ongoing, and no final decisions have been reached, they added. Criminal charges would deepen an unfolding crisis at Boeing, which has faced intense scrutiny from U.S. prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers after a panel blew off one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines mid-flight Jan. 5, just two days before the 2021 settlement expired. The sources did not specify what criminal charges Justice Department officials are considering, but one of the people said they could extend beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge. Alternatively, instead of prosecuting Boeing, the DOJ could extend the 2021 settlement by a year or propose new, stricter terms, the sources said. In addition to financial penalties, the strictest settlements typically involve installing a third party to monitor a company's compliance. The DOJ can also require the company to admit its wrongdoing by pleading guilty. Boeing may be willing to pay a penalty and agree to a monitor, but believes a guilty plea, which typically incurs additional business restrictions, could be too damaging, said one of the sources. Boeing derives significant revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, including the Defense Department, which could be jeopardized by a felony conviction, one of the sources said. Relatives of the victims of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes have long criticized the 2021 agreement, arguing that Justice Department officials should have prosecuted the company and its executives. At a Senate hearing in June, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun acknowledged the company's shortcomings on safety and apologized to the families who lost loved ones. Last week, the families pressed prosecutors to seek a fine against the planemaker of nearly $25 billion and move forward with a criminal prosecution.

Current stock owners will loose half their value (which is a good enough punishment for this lack of oversight), the state will have access to privileged company information which will allow the prosecution of human responsibles, top executives will be sacked (and their comp reduced by half since their comp is in stocks) and maybe the company will start on good base again. reply michaelt 9 hours agoparent> Current stock owners will loose half their value (which is a good enough punishment for this lack of oversight) I'm not opposed to this. But I think our corporations should be regulated by the government, not by shareholder oversight. After all, shareholders are essentially powerless in the current system. Each individual shareholder's power is far too dilute, many people owning shares through pension funds don't even know they're shareholders, the minority shareholders have no way to contact each other to coordinate, and it's completely normal for the likes of Apple to spend billions on secret projects and the shareholders to only find out after the fact. Hell, Google even has three classes of shares - one with no voting rights, one with 1x voting rights, and a special class with 10x voting rights for Larry and Sergei ensuring they have a majority of the votes even without majority ownership. If we think shareholders are supposed to be providing oversight to companies, they need vastly more power to do so. reply bell-cot 8 hours agorootparent> After all, shareholders are essentially powerless in the current system... Not exactly true. And both the institutional shareholders and ultra-rich shareholders have the experience, resources, and connections to police corporate behavior far more tightly than they usually do... But why should they bother policing behavior, when the maximum penalty for malfeasance has been wrist-slaps? (And similar for the banks and bond markets which large corporations rely upon.) Vs. if the major investors knew that major corporate malfeasance could and likely would cost them $billions - they might very quickly grow more active and assertive, the Boards which they elected would not be passive rubber-stampers, and corporate executives would face regular hard scrutiny. But all that would be real work. Vs. hiring lobbyists and schmoozing politicians, to make sure the maximum penalty is \"wrist slap\", is far easier. reply Analemma_ 2 hours agorootparent> And both the institutional shareholders and ultra-rich shareholders have the experience, resources, and connections to police corporate behavior far more tightly than they usually do... They really don't, at least not in the case of index fund investors like Vanguard and BlackRock. Have you ever read about their operations? They run a very lean ship. The only reason you're able to invest in index funds with 0.005% fees is because they have essentially nobody on staff, at least compared with the number of companies they invest in. They definitely can't do the kind of investigation and policing you're talking about without radically changing their pricing (and if they did do that, a competitor would come in offering to skip the inspections and go back to 0.005% fees, the money would flow there in droves, and we'd be right back where we started. The fundamental issue here is that passive investors don't care and you can't make them care.) reply tardy_one 14 minutes agorootparentSure, but that is the consequence of no consequences. It would be silly to be a quality fund when not voting or selling on risk analysis can't possibly cost an index fund more than they save. reply bell-cot 1 hour agorootparentprevNeither Index funds nor ETF's are likely to do the research & oversight stuff themselves, true. But that is quite different that saying that the Indexes & ETF's would for-sure sit on the sidelines if some more-active large shareholders were pushing a credible plan to force better behavior down the throats of a major corporation's C-suite. And the Indexes & EFT's backing such a measure - which effectively costs them 0.00000% to do - would likely prove the critical thumb sign from the Imperial Box. reply black_puppydog 9 hours agorootparentprevThe way I read GP's argument, the (yes, very diluted, but real) \"oversight\" would come from the fact that every shareholder would have to base their bidding price for e.g. Boeing shares on, among other things, the probability of this company being devalued by 51% following a scandal like this. If (and I understand this is a huge \"if\") this kind of action was more common, you might think twice before investing into any companies that run a serious risk of direct government interaction to protect the public. reply michaelt 6 hours agorootparentThe thing is: Imagine there are two planemakers, each has a computer system to record when they removed the door bolts. One company uses it 95% of the time while the other uses it 100% of the time. For the market to assign a different price to those companies, shareholders have to be able to tell which is which. Investors cannot tell. The official reports don't include anything that wasn't officially reported. People who know first-hand have insider information, and are forbidden from trading on it. Shareholders have no power to enter the assembly floor and carry out spot checks. And \"independent\" auditors like Accenture are even bigger clowns than Boeing themselves. reply verall 4 hours agorootparentI think that however flawed, capitalism might prevail here. If enough money was on the line, institutional investors might get actual permission to [hire experts to] enter the assembly floor and do spot checks. Not welcoming such a thing would cause a huge stock hit. etc. reply janalsncm 1 hour agorootparentI’m not sure what we should be waiting for. The time for the free market to fix Boeing and “capitalism” (read: don’t regulate us please) to save the day would have been before Boeing killed 400 people in plane crashes. I get that the idea of self-correcting markets are very appealing. But there are a ton of situations where they don’t work or don’t fix all of the problems they cause. Those situations are under the general umbrella of market failures. This particular market failure would probably be classified as adverse selection or more general information asymmetry. reply verall 40 minutes agorootparentI'm not advocating for less regulation in the slightest. I'm saying that when a corpo breaks laws (don't follow regulations and lie about it), the fines need to substantially hit their shareholders, so that shareholders are generally aligned with following regulations and will demand additional diligence. Otherwise the game will be as it is - commercial aviation is highly regulated, but Boeing is so big that the fines don't matter to them or their owners (i.e. shareholders). reply danaris 4 hours agorootparentprevIf you step back a bit, and look at the problem more broadly, it becomes clear that a major cause is the current level of consolidation, across the board. In particular, just in your comment, you name the planemakers—Airbus and Boeing—and the \"independent\" auditors. If there were two dozen different companies manufacturing planes, all of which were required to comply with the same regulations, and two dozen different major auditing companies, the chances of any given manufacturer getting away with this level of illegal corner-cutting for any length of time drop precipitously. At the same time, the costs of doing so rise, as it becomes much, much easier for the US government and various airlines to cut a manufacturer out of their contracts the next time they come up. reply teitoklien 9 hours agorootparentprevMight work in a world where only america exists. What you are suggesting will instead lead to a downward spiral of investor confidence in investing in American companies, and letting other world powers dominate in key tech areas of strategic interest where investors have more confidence and dont have to worry about gov punishing shareholders with no voting rights by taking away their shares These kinda ideas often seem to originate from a place of revenge or vengeance on someone folks feel is responsible (here its ‘shareholders’) Better to just install more government oversight (instead of more regulation) improve transparency, amend whistleblower laws to prevent retaliations that boeing did, etc. Those are much more important and useful for this country. reply skizm 6 hours agorootparentprevShareholders have the power to not buy the stock. reply JumpCrisscross 8 hours agoparentprev> Expropriate the company, at least 51%, take control and let public officials (knowing the US way, it will be some army general) set up checks and controls where necessary Why?

In olden times, the monarch's wealth was the state's wealth, and vice-versa. CEOs being shareholders has a similar problem, in that the only monetary punishment possible against the collective necessarily also harms those with no power to prevent the actions which were punished because it's not a democracy. (One dollar one vote != one person one vote; also the workforce generally, not sure about Boeing in particular, have minimal to zero shares/votes). For this reason, I favour a degree of personal responsibility for management all the way from line managers to the board… and for government officials all the way from parking inspectors to presidents.

The folks squeezing Boeing’s margins should know their suppliers are doing the same thing, and be suspicious of them. Either those folks were in on it with the suppliers or they just didn’t care about their own product’s quality. I’m not sure which I think is more likely. But either explanation is criminal negligence for this type of product. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentCompanies like Boeing generally can trace every material they get back to the mine or recycling center it came from. They won't buy if a slave was in the mine. Sure there are 7 layers of company between the mine and the company, but you still trace all those layers. This ensures not only do they not use things like slave labor, but also that the correct environmental controls are in place all down the line, and other such things. If Boeing isn't doing the above they are at fault for the mistakes. No pushing this off on a supplier the buck stops at Boeing who could have solved this.

And people contend that most of these issues, in one way or another, were down to that cost cutting.

There is a handheld scanner that you point at a piece of metal and it will tell you what the metal is, which spec it falls into, and the specific chemical makeup of the material when you pull the trigger. Using this equipment (it's called Positive Material Identification) for verifying material on receipt is part of every quality manual I have ever seen. In other words, if Boeing was using counterfeit material, it was either deliberately ignored or deliberately hidden by falsifying records. It is not uncommon to get material that has a Material Test Record that is within spec (because not all suppliers are scrupulous), but a PMI result that is out of spec. If that was what was happening here (which is what I suspect), then those PMI results were thrown out and whatever was written on the MTR were transferred to the receipt report or accepted as-is. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentThe supplier was intentionally falsifying records. And the parts were (near as anyone can tell) actual titanium, just with hidden defects. reply LargeWu 5 hours agorootparentThe question is whether Boeing knew this, and used the parts anyway, knowing they were not up to spec. reply dralley 5 hours agorootparent\"counterfeit\" can mean many things, and in this instance it doesn't necessarily mean \"the material was wrong\" so much as \"they lied about where they got it on the provenance paperwork\" reply EasyMark 3 hours agorootparentIn an industry where you are supposed to use QA and one of the most basic things is your material then it’s only common sense that you would randomly batch test the metallurgy on a supposed titanium shipment when it takes minutes to hours to check and “trust but verify” should be the basic SOP. I’m sure the details will come out. It’s a batch of 10 versus 10000 “widgets”. I’m not saying that’s what happened but if it becomes clear they skip critical QA tests like this then they are criminally negligent. reply lazide 3 hours agorootparentIt's easy to say criminally negligent, but near as I can tell - good luck pinning any of that on Boeing or a subsidiaries executive somewhere. Because yes, that would make sense. However, even if everything is perfect it’s expensive (and not just because you broke x percent of the product). If the products have flaws they aren’t supposed to, it’s also even more expensive. At least in the short term. And often embarrassing. So depending on the incentives and short term nature of the person deciding, there are a lot of incentives to not look too hard. reply LargeWu 2 hours agorootparent\"So depending on the incentives and short term nature of the person deciding, there are a lot of incentives to not look too hard.\" This gets at what has been reported as the fundamental problem at Boeing: It used to have a safety culture, when it was run by engineers. Now it's run by finance people, and it has a short-term profit culture. Instead of asking \"will this plane be safe to operate for the next 30 years\" it becomes \"will this plane be slightly more profitable to sell next quarter\". This is a major problem where safety is paramount. reply lazide 5 hours agorootparentprevThough in this case it was discovered because of corrosion problems on the parts that should not have been possible if they were made correctly. And they probably looked okay enough to not trigger any obvious ‘someone bought this off alibaba’ gut check. To your point though, the material itself was correct to a rough level at least chemically. So most likely it was a problem with the forgings being contaminated or the forging process itself being slightly wrong (assuming it was a forged part, which it seems to be). There is an old saw in manufacturing that “the only way to guarantee quality is to do it from the very start”. The challenge is if you do that it is usually expensive. Aerospace does all that paperwork nominally to try to guarantee that, and point the finger at anyone who tries to game the system. But it is also eventually impossible to actually optimize cost without compromising the quality. So it has actual (usually visible) limitations in scale from a cost perspective. And if someone knows that what they are doing is wrong, of course they are going to try to stop a finger from pointing back to them. so it’s inevitable when there is a lot of competition that suppliers run out of room to legitimately optimize, and they try to cut corners. Shitty suppliers will try to cut corners right off the bat of course. Chinese manufacturers are notorious for almost immediately starting to put fake or out of spec components into things they make for folks once the initial ‘proof’ run is done and people stop paying as much attention. That is why Apple watches their manufacturers like hawks, including folks who work for them being onsite. And there are a nearly infinite number of non-obvious ways to screw up the quality of something if someone is trying to cut corners, and from personal experience - Chinese manufacturers are uncommonly clever at it. Same with wholesalers, subcontractors, and any other middlemen. If the buyer is under similar pressure, they try to make up for it with ‘QA’. After all, even if the bag might be fake Gucci, if no one can tell, does it matter? Especially if it is half the cost? Really lazy post-facto inspections or performatively checking paperwork are also a part of it, instead of actually verifying everything was done correctly from the start of course. Because having others believe it too is important for everyone. That is inevitable in a ‘race to the bottom’, enshittification, etc. type scenario. As actually verifying quality is expensive. As things get crazier, inevitably that QA gets looser and looser, and more and more corners get cut - until something breaks. This is all due to the excessive low interest rate environment going on for so long, and the rising rates combined with a need to keep increasing stock prices causing a huge squeeze. Plus corporate idiocy and incompetence. It’s no surprise the larger corporations are more visibly being screwed here, due to scale. They aren’t allowed to be smart in the same way that small companies can, because they have to comply with all the other rules too even when they’re dumb. In many cases a smaller company can actually produce a higher quality product for less, because they can hire people who are very competent but couldn’t pass a corporate hiring filter, or that hates the corp world, or that wants/needs something that the corp world can’t handle (like a competent boss, or flexible vacation). They can also have folks like anal retentive asshole supervisors that would never make it in a Corp world, but could produce a better product. Or a chill supervisor that can enable creativity that the Corp world is currently squashing with anal retentive asshole supervisors. Made worse by massive BS being normalized (political + advertising situation right) emboldening predators and scammers, and post COVID burnout. Not that small companies are panaceas, they suffer from their own problems. But they do tend to be different - like capitalization issues. It’s quite the perfect storm of factors. It’s actually pretty amazing Boeing is going through this - though this is a repeated pattern for them frankly - because they already have such a well protected and near monopoly position. Near as I can tell, they don’t really need to be shaving pennies. And to answer the prior post - I doubt Boeing ‘knew’ (as documented) about the counterfeit parts, because that would require exceptional corporate stupidity. So definitely not impossible. But there were definitely folks in key positions that knew it was a risk and was likely going on at some level, and chose to ignore the risk due to other pressures/concerns. Good luck nailing them on it, however, as I’m sure some scapegoats are being found as we speak. That’s why they’re going after whistleblowers too. Personally, I imagine it’s even worse elsewhere, it just isn’t getting the press because it is at a smaller scale.

But what are the specifics of how they failed? I also get frustrated reading these comments here, which are basically \"Boeing bad, they only care about execs and shareholders, they ruined their engineering culture.\" I agree with all of that , but when the government wants to criminally charge someone or a company, they need some specifics (i.e. fraud).

In the case of Boeing it was making airplanes. They build you an airplane, you pay them for it, they had a list of rules to play by in order to reduce the costs of making that plane in order to make a profit. Boeing's incentives are to transfer as much value as humanly possible to its shareholders. They've made sure that large parts of their C-Suite, managers, executives, etc. are in on this by giving them shares. Those people have decided they don't want to play by the rules anymore. There's little incentive for them not to. If the Biden administration gets voted out in November, most of these regulatory and law enforcement pushes you've seen here of late (Adobe, TicketMaster, etc.) are going to go away because the people in charge at companies like Boeing have participated in regulatory capture. Thus, there are no more rules. You have to start throwing those people in prison (or worse) for the rest of their lives and make compensation in unrealized gains illegal if you want this to stop. reply dkarl 4 hours agoparentI agree, but I think we need to distinguish between the people and the corporation, and stop thinking that the way we treat people (such as the Boeing executives) will solve the system problem. We absolutely need to stop treating corporations like people -- and I'm not talking about taxation. I'm talking about the way we think and talk about corporations the same way we talk about people. When we domesticated animals, we had to be very cognizant that they were not people. For example, bulls are extremely aggressive and extremely physically powerful. You can allow a person into a room with a baby in a crib. There are exceptions, and they are treated as exceptions. With bulls, you do not allow them into a room with a baby in a crib, by default or by exception. It would be considered criminally irresponsible for a person to say, this bull is an exception, I've had it for five years, it's a great friend, and based on its past behavior I'm going to keep it in the same room with my infant child. You just wouldn't do that. We have enough experience with corporations to know that we need to start treating them less like humans and more like a species of partly domesticated but still extremely dangerous animal. Based on long experience with them, we should expect corporations to predictably lie, steal, and destroy whenever it is in their financial interest. We don't need to get rid of them (we don't have any good replacement for their role in the economy) but should structure the way we treat corporations around our knowledge of their destructive tendencies. Our long experience with cattle has taught us ways to protect humans from their destructive tendencies while still extracting what we want from them. We keep cattle out of our residences, we castrate most of the males, and we manage intact bulls in a way that ensures human safety while allowing them to serve their necessary functions. We design fences and other management technology with their aggression and power in mind. It is long past time to treat corporations the same way. In many small ways we have done this, but always held back by the human metaphor. Corporations are in a sense made of humans, and we feel a sense of respect towards fellow humans that we then unconsciously, and with horrible consequences, extend to the corporations they are part of. We need to consciously and decisively put that behind us. You don't have to be cynical about humans to accept that corporations are greedy and untrustworthy. That is their nature. How you square that with the nature of the humans who run them is irrelevant, as irrelevant as bovine neuroscience is to knowing that we should keep bulls out of our nurseries. We don't have to agree about humans to agree about corporations and stop giving them free reign to wreak havoc in society. reply InDubioProRubio 11 hours agoprevCriminal Neglicence Tax - CNT must be paid reply tjpnz 7 hours agoprevCEOs often justify their large pay packets by the massive responsibility they shoulder.

A whole team of engineers designing a critical system that can crash a plane with optional redundant inputs on inputs that are known to get blocked/fail are irresponsible. reply michaelt 9 hours agorootparentIn my experience, large corporations that want to get away with breaking the law have a structure something like this: * An \"everyone was doing it, and everyone knew\" layer of junior employees aged 20 or so. * An obfuscation layer, comprised of several levels of middle manager who regularly shift roles, companies and countries. * An \"I had no idea this was going on, and would have stopped it if I'd known\" layer. This is the CEO and suchlike. If the criminal behaviour comes to light, the top-layer employees pretend not to have known about it; the bottom-layer employees say (accurately) that everyone was doing it and they thought it was normal; and the middle layers split themselves between the two, relying on forgotten e-mails, miscommunications, and placing the blame on people who aren't around any more. reply ordu 8 hours agorootparentTheoretically, I believe, it is not hard to tackle this schema, just don't accept \"I had no idea\" as an excuse, not from CEO at least. reply SoftTalker 1 hour agorootparentYes, I believe the legal criteria is \"known or should have known\" that it was happening.

Hell, I'm not anywhere close to aviation, just have an interest in it, and even I know that AoA sensors are prone to failure (relatively, for an aeronautics component), can easily get blocked by external stuff, and multiple crashes and accidents have happened due to that. It's nothing short of criminal negligence to design a system using only one. That's why aviation has very strict reporting and documentation requirements, everything should be traceable. Of course Boeing failed at that too, with them being unable to say e.g. who actually worked on the famous missing bolts.

You could argue that the punishment is not harsh enough for deterrence, or not fast enough, but that's an issue with the government, not the market. Furthermore, the main reason why they are not more afraid of market repercussions is because they know the government needs them, they created a monopoly. The system is mostly working as it should. The malicious players were found relatively quickly, through a mix of whistleblowing and the first relatively minor accidents getting a lot of attention (fourth estate and all). Don't get me wrong, we need to keep making things better, there's so much work to do. But if the system were not working we would just have not heard about any of this and accidents would keep happening routinely while robber barons get filthy rich (literal violent monopolists, not plain billionaires), like 100 - 150 years ago. reply nickserv 8 hours agorootparentThe market can't do much in this case, as within the US, Boeing has a monopoly, and internationally its only competitor is Airbus. And there is a very strong \"lock-in\" in regards to pilot type rating. So while there is some competition, the airline industry is very much controlled and regulated by government. And here in particular there was a lot of failures in particular with the FAA allowing Boeing to self-regulate (when has that ever worked?) and then the DOJ failing to prosecute after the two deadly crashes. It really seems like a systematic problem, not an exception to an otherwise healthy situation. Time and time again we see a lack of consequences to corporate greed when those actions are literally killing people. You're quite correct that things are not as bad as during the robber barons era, but that is a pretty low bar. We can do much better. reply oersted 4 hours agorootparentI agree with all your points. And there is indeed a fundamental systemic issue with how private companies that deliver critical social services interact with the government: healthcare, education, energy, banking, logistics, real-state... In my anecdotal experience, the EU social-democratic model seems to be the most competent one right now specifically for this problem: more of these should be state-owned. Don't get me wrong, this is a crappy solution too, you are making a lot of sacrifices for it, but generally, these state-owned corporations do seem to be better at delivering critical services, and often (unintuitively) more efficiently than private ones. My point was that this is not necessarily about \"late-stage capitalism\" (as I understand it), this was not a case of the open market harming society. Because indeed Boeing is a state-supported monopoly and that's the root of the issue, at least in theory capitalism abhors monopolies. This happened because Boeing has both the duty to make the most money possible, and is protected by the government because they offer a critical service. There is something fundamentally broken in this incentive model. Either let them play in the open market and encourage competition, or make it non-profit and serve the state directly. A mix of both is a recipe for disaster. reply whatifitoldyou 8 hours agorootparentprevDo you think that issues being discovered in 2018 with 2 planes and 346 people lost and systemic safety issues persisting since then qualifies as \"relatively quickly\"? reply oersted 5 hours agorootparentYou are right, that is not remotely \"relatively quickly\", it should have been prevented. My point was generally that the system (and specifically the current flavour of capitalism) is not fundamentally broken, it has the right shape of components and they are working roughly how they are supposed to, to balance each other. If it was broken, things would be way worse, as we have seen throughout history. But there's so much to improve. I guess I am looking at it from a too wide lens. Sure things are working much better than they used to a century ago, such disasters were largely accepted as a normal cost of being productive, there was no system to correct them. But that's no excuse, I do agree with you, this Boeing mess was not acceptable, the system needs to do better. reply fransje26 8 hours agorootparentprev> It's just late-stage capitalism at work. >> Not really, it's just bad management I believe the argument being made is that in \"early-stage\" capitalism a company could not afford that type of management, as it would immediately loose the market due to \"true\" competition and other \"quality\" options being available. reply oersted 4 hours agorootparentI agree. Perhaps I don't have a good understanding of \"late-stage\" capitalism. I think that the current version of capitalism is \"working\" (very relatively), exactly because there is substantial oversight from the government and the media, and there should be more. An open and fair marketplace generally seems to be good at improving lives at scale. But I don't understand why so many people have this idea that it is a fundamental law of nature, that if you remove government intervention it will naturally become a more open and a more fair market. An open and fair marketplace is quite artificial and needs so much enforcement to keep alive. Futhermore, even if it is good in general, there are a huge number of exceptional emergent behaviours that are bad and require intervention. We clearly see from history that without oversight, the economy does not become an efficient market. It consolidates into rent-seeking monopolies, often defended and expanded by violence, controlled by an elite with a self-reinforcing long-lasting hold on power.

China and Korea could be speaking Japanese today and it would be fine for Americans. reply nine_k 4 hours agorootparentThe problem is not even a land grab per se (even though it does cause problems). The problem is that the grabbing party, having succeeded, does not stop, and develops an approach to international affairs that ends up being problematic in the long term. Germany in 1939 did not limit itself to acquiring Alsace and Lorraine, and even to grabbing most of Poland (along with its then-ally USSR), and even to grabbing most of France. Same for any historical empire. (The US in this regard is slightly different, e.g. it did not directly grab Texas, and bought large parts of California. Having grabbed the entire width of the continent, there remained little desire to grab the inhospitable south or north.) Your logic may work with e.g. Taiwan: I don't think China would go on an expansionist rampage once it grabs Taiwan (or \"returns\", some would say).

Once they were charged [...] It’s a lazy learned helplessness that’s always potentially right because it feeds into a type of cynicism The gp's key argument for Boeing is based on the \"Too Big To Fail\" idea. I.e. Boeing's deep relationship with the government. So far in this subthread, nobody has actually engaged with that specific part of his argument. Mentioning Theranos Holmes and FTX SBF who are _not_ deeply intertwined with the government like Boeing isn't really a counter to that. The cynicism comes from previous \"too big to fail\" situations such as 2008 Financial Crisis and nobody from Goldman Sachs, etc going to prison for fraud. Fines and financial settlements as punishments -- yes. But jail time for those bank executives -- no. It points to a subtle part of gp's comment I think replies are overlooking which is \"corporation\" vs \"employees\": - Boeing Inc the corporate entity may be criminally charged and found guilty. The corporation then pays a punitive fine or settlement. (The proverbial \"financial slap on the wrist.\") vs - actual Boeing employees are found guilty and sent to jail. Gp's \"this will go nowhere\" frustration is based on this scenario which history has shown to be very unlikely to happen. reply JumpCrisscross 7 hours agorootparent> Boeing is based on the \"Too Big To Fail\" idea. I.e. Boeing's deep relationship with government These are two separate concepts and you’re right, nobody has directly addressed them. Let me try. Too big to fail “is a theory in banking and finance that asserts that certain corporations, particularly financial institutions, are so large and so interconnected that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system, and therefore should be supported by government when they face potential failure” [1]. A key part to it is financial institutions can’t meaningfully go bankrupt—they don’t materially have tangible assets, they just fail. (It’s why bad banks go into receivership.) Boeing is not a bank. It’s not built almost solely on confidence. It, like the auto manufacturers, can go bankrupt without threatening its production. (GM and Chrysler went bankrupt [2]. Bankruptcy doesn’t mean we raze the factories.) Put succinctly, Boeing is NOT too big to fail. It does, however, have a deep and diverse relationship with government. Boeing has, by design, employees in every Congressional district. It’s strategically important to the U.S. and its allies and possesses an industrial-strength wheel greaser. That broad base of employees protects the plants. But as we’ve already seen, financial failure and even prosecution of senior leadership doesn’t blow up the plants. The strategic importance, meanwhile, is a two-edged sword. Boeing has power because it’s useful. Not only is that usefulness preserved through reörganisation, but if someone can claim it’s increased through it, the usefulness becomes a source of weakness. (Nobody cares if Chik-fil-a is mismanaged. They do when Boeing creates a national embarrassment at the ISS.) The only part that remains is the wheel greasing [3]. In this, Boeing is far from unique. It’s also unprotective against financial failure. Because, again, the wheels stay on if Boeing is reörganised. That may not be true if it continues on its current path. Especially as we’re lining up for a potential war in the South China Sea, Boeing’s military-industrial ties may be what forces those who’d prefer to look the other way to stare down the problem. We can’t win that war, if we have to fight it, with Boeing a shitshow. And we’re more likely to have to fight it every time Beijing sees it’s a shitshow. So yes, Boeing does have a deep relationship with government. But that doesn’t protect it from criminal prosecution or financial failure, and in some cases, may encourage the people pining for its reörganisation.

TBTF only works because financial institutions are built on confidence. You can’t reboot them through bankruptcy.

You have to make a lot of claims that your users can't test, so they rely on things like being able to audit your code and testing processes and/or your reputation. You also have to be able to make promises that your products and support (or something compatible) are going to be around for 10+ years. Boeing has already lost some of this trust with the issues in the consumer aviation sector, but the space and defense side of Boeing is still going strong. A bankruptcy could risk Boeing's space and defense lines. One big fault here is with Boeing's board. Boards are supposed to control the short-term greed of executives and protect stock value. Boeing's board should do a prophylactic firing of the C-suite (replace the CEO with someone who will fire the rest",

The Windows file system is famously slow. It'd make more sense to compare a Cosmo binary running on WIN32 with a WIN32 native program. For example, Emacs has a WIN32 port where they wrote all the Windows polyfills on their own, and because they aren't experts on Windows, the official GNU Emacs Windows releases go a lot slower on Windows than if you just compile Emacs from source on Linux using Cosmo and scp the the binary over to run on Windows. See https://justine.lol/cosmo3/ reply tracker1 3 hours agoparentprevI don't know enough to compare to musl, but I suspect being ISC licensed (similar to musl's MIT license) allows for static linking without upstream impact such as GPL. Would be curious regarding features and performance comparisons with musl, which seems to come up a little short compared to say gnu libc. reply jart 2 hours agorootparentCosmo author here. We used to build our code with musl-cross-make. Once Cosmopolitan got good enough that we could compile GCC using Cosmo, our build latency dropped in half. https://x.com/JustineTunney/status/1726141024597324189 Cosmopolitan Libc is 2x faster than Musl Libc for many CLI programs like GNU Make and GCC because it has vectorized string libraries like strlen(). Musl won't merge support it on x86. I even mailed Rich patches for it years ago. Cosmopolitan's malloc() function is very fast. If you link pthread_create() then it'll create a dlmalloc arena for each core dispatched by sched_getcpu(). If you don't use threads then it'll use a single dlmalloc arena without any locking or rdtscp overhead. Cosmo has pretty good thread support in general, plus little known synchronization primitives from Mike Burrows. You can do things like build a number crunching program with OpenMP and it'll actually run on MacOS and Windows. Cosmopolitan plays an important role in helping to enable the fastest AI software on CPUs. For example, Mozilla started an open source project called LLaMAfile a few months ago, which runs LLMs locally. It's based off the famous llama.cpp codebase. The main thing Mozilla did differently was they adopted Cosmopolitan Libc as its C library, which made it easy for us to obtain a 4x performance advantage. https://justine.lol/matmul/ I'm actually giving a talk about it this week in San Francisco. reply saghm 2 hours agorootparentprevI suspect parent commenter isn't just asking about static linking from the perspective of licensing but about technical feasibility; at least part of the reason people use musl is that static linking glibc isn't well supported. reply yjftsjthsd-h 2 hours agoparentprevI would argue it's less about the build process and more about the user experience - no install, no \"pick the right binary for your platform\", just \"download this file and run it\".

For example, on my side I'm developing tooling that allows one to delink programs back into object files. This allows me to commit a whole bunch of heresy according to CS101, such as making a native port of a Linux program to Windows without having access to its source code or taking binary code from a PlayStation game and stuffing it into a Linux MIPS program. When you're doing that kind of dark magic, it's one of those \"know the rules so well you can break them\" situation. Instead of following the theory that tells you what you should do, you follow the real-life world that constrains what you can do. reply asveikau 4 hours agoparentprevYears ago I read some of the author's posts (they're active on HN too iirc) about it, and it seemed to me like they were relying heavily on the internals of the loader or dynamic linker on each platform, such that a new release for any given OS could conceivably break your binary. It's probably a very fun project to hack on but I would advise against distributing the binaries and expecting them to work over the long term. reply TimTheTinker 3 hours agorootparentTo my recollection, at least on *nix operating systems, they got some changes made to the POSIX standard to formalize behavior the binaries rely on. So going forward, mere POSIX compliance and ongoing ABI compatibility guarantee the binaries will continue to work on *nix operating systems. On Windows, backwards ABI and executable compatibility has always been an extremely high priority, so I think the danger of future breakage is low. Neither of those speak to macOS, but maybe someone who knows more can help clarify. reply asveikau 2 hours agorootparentI disagree with your assessment in all cases. You simply do not know what you were talking about. Standardization efforts and backward compatibility assumes a well-behaved application. If you explicitly depend on really weird hacky stuff like abusing corner cases in the object file format, you risk breakage and you will break. In the Unix world, firstly, platforms that aren't Linux typically say that if you don't do syscalls through system libc, all bets are off. Second, if they standardized a few things here and there, they are likely standardizing stuff that will formed applications linked with typical libraries will exercise. Standardization does not imply explicitly listing all possible corner cases of your object file format. On Windows, I happen to be a former Microsoft dev who worked on Windows in 2008-2011. If an app were trying to push the limits of the PE format, I don't think it would get fixed on the platform side... I've seen popular applications do much less bad things and get broken. reply yjftsjthsd-h 2 hours agorootparent> I disagree with your assessment in all cases.

If you explicitly depend on really weird hacky stuff like abusing corner cases in the object file format, you risk breakage and you will break. Sure, but if you get the standard to include your use then it's not a hacky edge case anymore. Ex. https://justine.lol/cosmo3/ \"POSIX even changed their rules about binary in shell scripts specifically to let us do it\" > https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1250 reply oguz-ismail 1 hour agorootparentSee https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40775600 POSIX doesn't sanctify this use. reply jart 1 hour agorootparentprevCosmo author here. Could you please clarify what specific object file features we're abusing? The only hacky thing I did was remove the shebang line, and POSIX was awesome enough to change their rules to let us do it. https://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1250 Beyond that, we just depend on stable ABIs and APIs. We don't link NTDLL for example. It's just straight up WIN32. On MacOS ARM we use the dynamic linker. I want Cosmo programs to stand the test of time. That's why I stopped building apps with NodeJS and wrote this instead. The whole reason this release is on the HN front page, is probably because it got rid of MAP_FIXED mappings and page size assumptions. So if you can tell me where we're still exposed, then I'd love to fix it. Thanks! reply hiAndrewQuinn 10 hours agoparentprevI'm somewhat of the same mind, but I'm fairly sure a study of Operating Systems: Three Easy Steps would get me over the hump. There's no actual reason to suspect this thing would like, sidestep normal process management or memory virtualization or something and run amok... I think. reply alganet 10 hours agoparentprevIt should work. We should have portable executables across many operating systems and architectures. The other expectation is scary. reply duped 3 hours agorootparentWhy? Hardware and software architectures often have radically different needs from their loader, it doesn't make sense to have one format to rule them all. And any format flexible enough to support all use cases would just be a container for other formats, and in practice, loaders would ignore the variants that they don't/can't support so developers would need to care about porting things anyway. ELF is pretty stable across many architectures and platforms but it's proven to be inflexible enough for plenty of applications where people develop their own, or alter it in varying ways. reply 3836293648 6 hours agorootparentprevWorking across unices is reasonable. Adding Windows is less so reply cpach 6 hours agorootparentIt’s quite rare to ship multi-Unix binaries, isn’t it? Cosmopolitan is a very cool hack indeed, but IMHO it’s not likely to gain widespread usage. reply TimTheTinker 3 hours agorootparentprevCreating polyglot source code is a well-studied type of hack. If that's possible, why not polyglot executables? After all, an executable file format is essentially another type of source code. Pair that with a polyglot ABI and polyglot system calls... and you get APE binaries :) reply flohofwoe 4 hours agorootparentprevA thin POSIX layer and ELF loader shouldn't be too much of a problem for Microsoft to implement if they wanted to do so (WinNT actually did have a POSIX personality at some point, but I don't think that's still supported). I'd also like to see a builtin WASM runtime in all operating systems. reply vidarh 2 hours agorootparentIndeed, back in '95 or so there was a library called CrossELF that'd let you compile ELF so files and use a tiny loader linked to CrossELF for each platform you cared about to load the main .so file, and you could build platform-independent code with it. I remember writing some simple networking code where the loader just had a tiny set of shims for a few calls and the rest of the networking code was a single binary for both Linux and Win32. The problem is wrapping the relevant APIs - as you can see w/e.g. Wine. For some functionality - like networking - the surface is pretty small, for others its a nightmare. reply boricj 3 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft did implement a not-so-thin POSIX layer and an ELF loader atop the NT kernel, it's WSL1 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). It was obsoleted by WSL2, which uses a specifically-tuned Linux VM instead for performance and completeness reasons. I haven't played with it, but I think the classic Windows POSIX subsystem used the COFF/PE file formats instead of ELF. reply cpach 8 hours agorootparentprevThere’s also Java, Python, Ruby, NodeJS etc etc. reply mgaunard 9 hours agoparentprevIt doesn't really work, the libc is widely non-conforming.

Redbean + Windows + SQLite should be considered something fun for personal use cases at best. In general though Redbean was never intended to be an production system. Its logo is after all a photo of a toy. But if you're going to run it in prod anyway, then please use UNIX folks. We spent a lot of time making sure system calls like fsync() will behave the way the SQLite authors intended across the various flavors which have a surprising amount of depth, although not quite so bad a horror show as Windows file locks. reply Nevin1901 9 hours agoprevThe \"actually portable executable header\", fun to read through: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jart/cosmopolitan/1.0/ape/... reply dirkc 6 hours agoparentI just scrolled for the images, I don't know about reading assembly for fun :) reply stephc_int13 4 hours agoprevIs there a plan to distribute the cosmopolitan libc without all the APE stuff?

Cosmo has impact and velocity since I only have to get my code to work on GCC 12.3 which produces binaries for all OSes. Occasionally I'll write code like stdckdint.h (https://github.com/jart/jtckdint) that can be consumed by all the cosmocc competitors, e.g. xcode, msvc, etc. but doing that requires a painstaking amount of effort. reply modeless 1 hour agoprevThe commit message for the first commit there says \"Actually Portable Executable now supports Android\".

Unfortunately, Lua. From a user point of view (well, at least this user), TypeScript would be a better fit. reply ukuina 7 hours agorootparentWhat are your misgivings about Lua? reply NateEag 6 hours agorootparentNot OP, but having written some Lua, I can make some guesses: - Relatively obscure language, so potential contributor base is limited from the start - Lua shares PHP's \"One datatype to rule them all\" design, which works but feels ugly. In PHP it's \"arrays\", in Lua it's \"tables\", but either way you have all the attendant problems and weird edge cases to learn - Expanding on above point, Lua's APIs for working with tables are, uh, idiosyncratic. Slicing a \"list\", last I looked, was an unintuitive monstrosity like `new_table = { table.unpack(old_table, start_index, length) }` I could keep going, but I have other things to do during my brief time in this universe. To any Lua aficionados out there, my apologies if I've misrepresented it. Corrections to my misunderstandings will be appreciated. reply auggierose 3 hours agorootparentprevNone in particular, except that all the code I am currently writing is in TypeScript. Especially if it comes together with HTML files. reply giraffe_lady 4 hours agorootparentprevLua is too bare bones. It's a carefully considered tradeoff for the project goals of being a very small & easily embeddable language for C projects, but it means you need to implement too much load-bearing functionality yourself. Each lua project ends up being an ad hoc framework composed of C bindings and standard lib extensions, but it doesn't have an ecosystem that makes this straightforward or consistent. A lot of people like lua from using it on very small projects, or like, spiritual reasons related to its implementation simplicity. But having used it quite a lot professionally, in practice it ends up being a slog to work with. All that said, lua is closely tied to C, and embedded in a C project is both its intended use and the place where it fits best. So while I don't really like lua and would almost never choose it myself, this is one of the rare exceptions where I think it's a good choice. A lot of people want redbean to use TS or python instead, and imo either would make it much bigger, more complex, for relatively little benefit. It would definitely benefit from a more full-featured language, but I think a weirder one that is still intended for embedding in C would be best. Something out there like janet or fuck it, tcl. But lua has a lot of allure for a lot of programmers and I think gives the project a feeling of \"old school cool\" while still being pretty accessible. So is probably the best choice in the end. reply DrNosferatu 9 hours agoparentprevA Web Interface for Cosmopolitan Apps would be a great bridge for an UI. reply lxgr 4 hours agorootparentLlamafile does that (i.e. it hosts a local web server that presents a GUI). reply auggierose 9 hours agorootparentprevI am looking for an Electron replacement for writing my apps.

It looks like qjs also has patches for recent-ish versions of the Typescript compiler as well. Someone has made a nodejs-style project called txiki.js [2] using vanilla qjs. Maybe it would build with Cosmopolitan with some tweaking. But if you're thinking of packaging a whole browser engine like Electron that might be a Sisyphian effort.

Something like TypeScript would require a transpiler to JS and a JS runtime, which as far as I know, even the smallest one would be much bigger than Lua. And Lua has well defined semantics to call C and be called by C, which may be hard to do with JS/TS. reply DrNosferatu 8 hours agorootparentAny examples and good tutorials on how to best go about it? reply brabel 3 hours agorootparentBest go about using Redbean?

    "originBody": "Ashley M. Gjovik Apple's Secret Silicon Fab Next to Thousands of Homes In early 2015, Apple started stealth semiconductor fabrication activities in a facility located at 3250 Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara California, less than two hundred feet from thousands of homes. The factory intentionally vented its exhaust of solvent vapors and toxic gases straight from the roof and into the ambient outdoor air, with little or no abatement. The factory was only one story while the apartments were four stories tall, nearly ensuring the factory exhaust entered the apartment windows and 'fresh air intake' vents. Gjovik lived at these apartments in 2020 and found herself in the emergency room within one week, disabled by symptoms of solvent and gas exposure. Later in 2020, Gjovik conducted air testing and bio-monitoring which found the presence of Apple's factory exhaust inside her home, and inside her body. Gjovik initially suspected her exposure to chemicals was due to the Brownfield clean-up site the apartments were built on, and/or the Superfund chemical plume historically under the apartments, however the known concentrations did not provide a plausible explanation for the severity of her symptoms with any of the possible vectors. In February 2023, Gjovik discovered the semiconductor fabrication activities at 3250 Scott Blvd and began researching, finding more and more evidence that it was actually Apple who made her sick in 2020, so sick she thought she was dying (and apparently she was). Read Gjovik's June 12 2023 tip and complaint to the US EPA about the site. Read the US EPA's April 30 2024 Enforcement & Compliance inspection report summarizing what they found when they conducted formal inspections based on Gjovik's tips. Gjovik's June 2023 US EPA Complaint: 3250_scott_complaint_-_final.pdf Download File 3250 Scott Blvd & the Santa Clara Square Apartments The Secret Silicon Fab Plant (3250 Scott Blvd) Quoted from Fourth Amended Complaint in: Ashley Gjovik v. Apple Inc., 23-cv-04597-EMC (N.D. Cal. May 20 2024). Decision and Order approving the two toxic torts to move forward: Order (May 20 2024). In early 2015, Apple started stealth semiconductor fabrication activities in a facility located at 3250 Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara, California.[1] Like some sort of Skunkworks, Apple codenamed the facility “ARIA” and even tried to use the codename on regulatory paperwork. The ARIA semiconductor fabrication facility operated less than three hundred feet from thousands of homes where Gjovik lived in 2020. Also within 300 from the building were two public parks (Creekside Park and Meadow Park), picnic tables, outdoor fitness stations, and a children’s playground. Within 1,000 feet of ARIA there was also a church, a school, an elder care facility, and the San Tomas Aquino Creek and public trail. (San Tomas Aquino Creek flows to the Bay and then into the Pacific Ocean). Apple intentionally vented its fabrication exhaust – unabated – and consisting of toxic solvent vapors, gases, and fumes – into the ambient outdoor air. The factory was one story, while the apartments were four stories tall, creating a high likelihood that Apple’s factory exhaust entered the interior air of the apartments through open windows and the 'fresh air intake' vents. Apple was fully aware of this facility and its operations, including the vast amount of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, as every year, Apple submitted a financial assurance document to the Santa Clara Fire Department and HazMat agency, which detailed hazardous waste treatment and disposal operations, and is personally signed by Apple’s Chief Financial Officer, Luca Maestri – including affixing a company seal. Each financial assurance filing also attached a detailed confirmation letter from Apple’s third-party auditor, E&Y, on behalf of Apple. Maestri was also on the email distribution list for notification of hazardous waste violations at the facility. Upon initiating operations at ARIA, Apple was quickly cited for building, environmental, health, safety, and fire code violations in at least 2015 (stop work order due to construction without permits), 2016 (spill of cooling water into storm drains, fire code and CalASPA violations, health and safety code violations, failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge), 2019 (wastewater testing violations), 2020 (fire code violations, using two EPA identification numbers, inaccurate hazmat inventory data, no spill plans or training, no business permit, no signature from supervisor on records, and failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge again). In February 2020, Gjovik moved into a large, new apartment complex at 3255 Scott Blvd (adjacent to ARIA) and quickly became severely ill. Gjovik suffered severe fainting spells, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, stomach aches, exhaustion, fatigue, and strange sensations in her muscles and skin. Gjovik also suffered bradycardia (slow heart rate), volatile blood pressure with both hypertension and hypotension and a high frequency of premature ventricular contractions (an arrhythmia). From February 2020 through September 2020, Gjovik was screened for multiple severe and fatal diseases and disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumors, deadly arrhythmias, and Neuromyelitis Optica – instead, all of Gjovik’s symptoms were consistent with chemical exposure. Due to the solvent exposure, Gjovik also suffered skin rashes, burns, and hives, and her hair fell out and she had a shaved head for nearly a year as the bald patches slowly grew back. Due to the sudden illness, Gjovik visited the Emergency Room on February 13 2020, and Urgent Care (at AC Wellness, Apple’s for-profit in-house clinic) on February 20 2020. Gjovik subsequently consulted with dozens of doctors, who screened her for all sorts of diseases, subjecting Gjovik to extensive blood draws, urine samples, injections, and scans – including potentially dangerous procedures like MRI and CT scans with contrast, of which Gjovik had multiple. Gjovik was too sick to work and went on disability. Gjovik transitioned her medical care to a different clinic and provider after her Apple primary care provider at AC Wellness refused to help her triage her 2020 medical issues (due to exposure to Apple’s factory exhaust). Instead she suggested Gjovik could be suffering from anxiety, and enrolled Gjovik in an Apple internal user study related to blood pressure, requiring Gjovik share her iPhone medical and fitness data with Apple, and participate in weekly life coaching sessions (while being exposed to Apple’s solvent vapor and gas exhaust). While sick in 2020, Gjovik would wake up occasionally at 3 AM feeling like she was dying and with symptoms of heart failure and asphyxia. Heart monitoring showed arrhythmias, bradycardia, and low blood pressure. On September 2 2020, Gjovik discovered elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) in her indoor air. What immediately captured Gjovik’s attention was the arge spike in VOCs had occurred the night prior, around 3 AM, while she had been suffering from one of these “dying” spells. Gjovik sought out multiple occupational and environmental exposure doctors, who told Gjovik that all of her symptoms were consistent with solvent and other chemical exposures. After Gjovik discovered her medical issues at the apartment were due to a chemical emergency, Gjovik quickly filed complaints with Santa Clara City HazMat/Fire Department, California EPA DTSC and Air Resources Board, and US EPA. She also called Poison Control, who said what she described also sounded like Benzene exposure. (Apple reported it was exhausting Benzene into the air). City Fire Department records for ARIA contain at least sixteen chemical spill/leak incident reports at ARIA within only three years. These incident reports included eight confirmed leaks/spills: leaks of phosphine and silane on June 1 2019 at 9:17 AM; a phosphine leak on October 21 2019 at 11:06 PM; a 17.5 PPM Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (“TEOS”) leak on July 17 2020 at 8:58 AM; a major phosphine leak on April 30 2021 at 8:29 AM (peaking at 32 PPB and 0.0001145 pounds of the gas vented into the exterior ambient air); a 5% fluorine gas leak on April 18 2022 at 10:42 AM, a Hexafluorobutadiene leak on May 29 2022 at 2:19 PM, and leaks of two unnamed toxic gases on September 20 2022 at 7:44 AM and December 21 2022 at 1:40 AM. Notably, almost all of the reported toxic gas leaks during the time frames Gjovik had complained n 2020 that her symptoms seemed to always be the worst around 8-9 AM, 10-11 PM, and sometimes around 2-3 AM. One of the chemical spills that did not occur during those times of concern was root caused to an Apple engineer “accidently” turning on lethal fluorine gas. Similarly, another incident, the TEOS leak, was root caused to an Apple engineer accidently installing the gas for a tool “backwards.” Further, less than two weeks following the April 30 2021 phosphine leak, Apple’s manifests included sixty pounds of “vacuum filters contaminated with glass dust,” implying there may have also been a phosphine explosion. Further, later in 2021-2022, Apple reported to the government. that in the year 2020, Apple released at least 7.8 tons (15,608 pounds) of VOCs and 260 pounds of the combustible solvent N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) into the exterior air around ARIA. Per a review of Apple’s manifests, Apple did not replace the carbon/charcoal in its exhaust system for over five years, with the first replacement occurring December 14, 2020 – only after Gjovik had notified Apple EH&S and environmental legal about what occurred to her near ARIA. In 2022, the US EPA severely restricted the legal use of NMP as “it presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health” under TSCA. Apple also reported that in at least 2019-2021, that ARIA exhausted reportable amounts of mercury, arsenic, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde into the ambient air around the factory. Further, Apple reported to the Bay Area Air Quality Management Board that ARIA exhausted an average of 16 pounds a day of isopropyl alcohol vapors. In September 2020, Gjovik hired an industrial hygienist to test the indoor air at her apartment. She purchased an inspection, soil testing, and a two-hour sorbent tube-based TO-17 air panel. Only half the total contaminants were accounted for in the test and the California EPA informed her that testing with Summa canisters for 24 hours is superior and would have yielded better results. Still, Gjovik’s limited testing returned results showing a number of the chemicals in use by Apple at ARIA including Acetone, Acetonitrile, Acetaldehyde, Benzene, 1,2-Dichloroethane, Ethanol, Ethylbenzene, Hexane, Isopropanol, Isopropyl toluene, Methylene Chloride, Toluene, and Xylene. In September 2020, Gjovik set up additional air monitors to observe the levels of VOCs in her apartment next to the ARIA factory (though she was not aware of the factory exhaust at that time). The results of the data validated what Gjovik had noticed with her symptoms and ad hoc testing – that the VOCs mostly spiked early in the morning and late at night as if they were being exhausted from an automated mechanical system (which it was). Gjovik notified several Apple executives of her findings and activities, including her managers Powers. In September 2020, Gjovik’s blood and urine medical tests returned results with industrial chemicals, including arsenic, mercury, Toluene (Hippuric Acid), and Xylenes (2-3-4 Methyl hippuric Acid. Also noteworthy are the symptoms of Gjovik’s 3 AM attacks, (including both subjective reporting and physical real-time heart monitoring) match Phosphine and Arsine gas exposure. Both Phosphine and Arsine are very dangerous, exposure can be fatal, and there are no antidotes. Apple has a significant quantity of Arsine gas on site, and Gjovik’s medical tests from September 2020, on the morning after one of the 3 AM attacks, revealed significant arsenic in her blood with no other explanation than Arsine gas exposure within the prior eight hours. Apple’s leaks, spills, and releases were not limited to the air. Apple’s wastewater discharge monitoring repeatedly showed the presence of heavy metals and organic solvents. In 2017, the government mandated testing revealed the presence of 29 μg/L of 1,1-Dichloropropane, 24 μg/L of Trichloroethylene (“TCE”), and 6.7 μg/L of Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE). Among other issues, it’s unclear why Apple had TCE on site but not in any of its chemical inventories, and then, in addition, why exactly Apple was pouring that TCE down the drain. ARIA reported an average daily water usage of around 44,000 gallons per day and the sewer pipes carrying ARIA’s discharges flowed downhill and directly around the apartment where Gjovik lived in 2020. In 2020, the government had already started investigating the plumbing at her apartment as a possible vector for some unknown solvent vapor pollution. In September 2020, Gjovik noticed an Apple facility at 3250 Scott Boulevard across the street, which was also on the Superfund groundwater plume. Gjovik mentioned the facility to Apple on at least September 8, 9, 10, and 13, 2020 – inquiring if anyone was familiar with the area because Apple had an office there. Apple EH&S and Gjovik had at least two phone calls. The woman who responded who was also actually in charge of Real Estate/EH&S teams involved in Gjovik’s Superfund office at 825 Stewart Drive (“Stewart 1”) and the activities at ARIA. In September 2021, the Apple EH&S manager, Elizabeth, suggested that Gjovik use a special paid leave to move out of the apartment called ‘extreme condition leave’ designated for disasters. Later, in September 2021, Apple Employee Relations conferred with Elizabeth about Gjovik’s environmental concerns only hours before Gjovik was abruptly terminated. On February 21 2023, Gjovik discovered the semiconductor fabrication activities at ARIA. Gjovik posted on Twitter in real-time as she learned about it, expressing severe distress.[1] Until that day, Gjovik did not know it was Apple who was responsible for making her so ill in 2020. Further, until that day, Gjovik did not know the chemicals she was exposed to in 2020 were potentially lethal to human life. Gjovik began researching the site and Apple's activities, with the findings making Gjovik feel compelled to file a formal complaint about Apple’s illegal conduct at ARIA. On June 23 2023, Gjovik filed complaints about ARIA to the US EPA, CalEPA, the city of Santa Clara, and Santa Clara County. Gjovik drafted a 28-page memo with dozens of exhibits. Gjovik also posted on Twitter that she did so and provided a public link. The US EPA responded and took the lead on an investigation. Gjovik met with the US EPA’s RCRA Enforcement & Compliance team several times before they then inspected Apple’s factory in August 2023 and January 2024. The August 17, 2023 inspection was coded as an RCRA “Compliance Evaluation Inspection,” defined as “primarily an on-site evaluation of the compliance status of the site about all applicable RCRA Regulations and Permits.”[2] The January 16, 2024 inspection was coded as a “Focused Compliance Inspection.”[3] Gjovik is still awaiting a report on the results. The US EPA notified her they finalized the report but are currently unable to share it with her as Apple apparently declared the report of their (assumed) numerous environmental violations is Apple Confidential. Gjovik has a pending FOIA request as well. Creation & Maintenance of a Private Nuisance at 3250 Scott Blvd Apple created and maintained a condition in violation of Cal.Civ.C. § 3479. This nuisance was demonstrably injurious to health, which was indecent and offensive to the senses and obstructed the free use of property. By acting and failing to act, Apple created a condition or permitted a condition to exist that was harmful to health, offensive to the senses, an obstruction to the free use of property, and a fire, explosion, and poisoning hazard. Apple’s conduct in acting or failing to act was intentional, unreasonable, negligent, and reckless. Apple is continuously casting pollution upon the property of the owner and tenants of adjacent properties, as it knew it would do when it constructed its exhaust and HVAC systems and hazardous waste handling systems. It knew then, as it knows now, that so long as it would continue its operation, the pollution would continue to fall, not by accident or mishap, but in conformity with the knowledge it had before the construction of the systems. Apple should be presumed to have intended its act's natural, known, and reasonable consequences. Apple’s interference would and did substantially annoy or disturb persons of normal health and sensibilities in the same community. Apple’s operations at the factory and Superfund site are both continuing nuisances, and every continuation of the nuisance or trespass gives rise to separate damages claims. Apple has the agency and ability to stop the nuisance (it is not permanent), so until it does, the nuisance Apple created is continuous. Apple’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing Gjovik’s harm. Gjovik did not consent to a defendant’s conduct, and the seriousness of the harm outweighs the social utility of Apple’s conduct. Apple damaged Gjovik’s property and injured Gjovik’s person. Due to Apple’s actions, Gjovik’s property was destroyed, the leasehold degraded, she became very ill, and she suffered severe emotional distress. In or about 2015, Apple constructed, or caused to be constructed, exhaust vents and open tanks at ARIA in Santa Clara, near the common border line of the defendant's and Gjovik’s property. The exhaust vents were installed and maintained negligently, recklessly, and unskillfully. Apple exhausted through the vents and emptied various materials or substances into the open tanks that caused a foul, obnoxious, and disagreeable odor and polluted the atmosphere / ambient air of Gjovik’s leasehold property. Apple’s facility emits large quantities of vapors, dust, chemicals, and other contaminants into the air, which are carried by the natural winds and air currents onto Gjovik’s property and collect Gjovik’s chattel property and are generally injurious to Gjovik’s health, are offensive to the senses, and interfered with Gjovik’s comfortable enjoyment of life and property. Apple created the nuisance due to unnecessary, unreasonable, and injurious methods of operation of their business. The emissions were a business decision to be able to report reduced waste sent to landfills. Strict Liability for Ultrahazardous Activities at 3250 Scott Blvd Apple’s fabrication activities at ARIA provided a high degree of risk of significant harm to people and property, and the exercise of reasonable care could not eliminate the risk; the activity's benefits do not outweigh the risks, and these activities are inappropriate for the location, Apple’s activities at ARIA, directly adjacent to High-Density Residential and numerous sensitive receptors (including parks, schools, and playgrounds) is in violation of city and county zoning rules. Apple’s facility was originally registered simply as an “R&D Facility” (it appears Apple went to much effort to ensure no one knew they were doing semiconductor fabrication at the location). The ARIA building is located on “Light Industrial” zoned land (18.48), however semiconductor fabrication is expressly not allowed on any land other than “Heavy Industrial” zoned land (18.50). The state Fire Code also includes numerous other regulations targeted at the semiconductor fabrication processes (see, e.g., Cal. Fire Code Ch. 17 – “Semiconductor Fabrication Faculties”). Santa Clara City Code, Santa Clara County Code, and California Fire Code all explain that facilities which process raw materials (10.60.090) and require hazardous material and hazardous waste management, must be located in Heavy Industrial zoned land, must go through an application/review process, and may still be denied if their activities (and emissions) would create a nuisance for other industrial facilities in that area. Further, Santa Clara City Code requires that any industrial zoned properties be located at least 500 feet away from any Residential zoned properties. Apple stored, used, treated, and released a large quantity of lethal gases at ARIA. Apple possessed and used substantial amounts of arsine, phosphine, silane, fluorine, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and phosphorus trichloride. In addition, many of Apple's chemicals at the plant were characterized as “extremely hazardous substances,”[1] “highly toxic gases,”[2] and/or “acute and extremely hazardous wastes.”[3] Regardless of other considerations, California Fire Code requires that any storage or processing of highly toxic gases occur no less than twenty feet away from the property lot line and public sidewalks. Further, California Fire Code strictly prohibits the storage, use, or treatments of toxic gases within 75 feet of air intakes in adjacent buildings. This rule applies in Heavy Industrial zoning, where these activities should have been conducted. Apple intentionally venting unabated toxic gases and lethal chemicals into the ambient air only 250 feet from an open-air children’s playground – is exactly the policy justification for Ultrahazardous Activities tort enforcement as a common law zoning mechanism. Apple conducted semiconductor fabrication activities, with extremely dangerous substances, openly dumping its unabated chemical exhaust into the ambient air, only 150 feet from High-Density Residential with thousands of apartments, and 250 feet away from two public parks and a children’s playground. The storage, use, treatment, and release of large quantities of highly toxic, extremely poisonous, acutely lethal gases – directly adjacent to an unsuspecting, High Density Residential area – and directly adjacent to public parks and children’s playgrounds – is an activity which, even when conducted with the greatest of care and prudence, can still cause severe injuries, fatalities, and mass human suffering (e.g. Bhopal). Thus, these activities – in this location, scenario, and context – are Ultrahazardous Activities. Apple’s use, storage, and release (intentional and unintentional” of highly toxic gases can produce a dense cloud of lethal gas that would be large enough to engulf the apartments. Such an emissions could easily cause mass fatalities and severe suffering. The condition Apple created and permitted to exist resulted from Ultrahazardous Activities and for which strict liability should also exist. Apple violated the spirit of the Clean Air Act, if not the law, which “criminalizes knowing or negligent “releases into the ambient air [of] any hazardous air pollutant . . . or extremely hazardous substance” that give rise to imminent danger,” [42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(4)– (5)]. Similarly, Apple’s activities likely violated RCRA when Apple “knowingly transports, treats, stores, disposes of, or exports any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter . . . in violation of … of this section [and] knows at that time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.” [42 U.S.C. § 6928(e)]. Apple also released chemicals categorized by Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93000 as “Substances Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants,” of which there is no safe level of exposure without “significant adverse health effects. “Apple released into the air chemicals categorized under 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(b) as “Hazardous Air Pollutants” and Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93001 as “Hazardous Air Pollutants Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants.” Apple was engaged in Ultrahazardous Activities that caused Gjovik to be harmed. Apple’s activities were the proximate cause of that harm, and Apple is responsible for that harm. People who engage in ultrahazardous activities are responsible for the harm these activities cause others, regardless of how carefully they carry out these activities. Apple damaged Gjovik’s chattel property (discoloring, weakening, dissolving glues, causing reactions), degraded her extremely expensive leasehold conditions, and harmed Gjovik’s mind and body.

Of course, but for most people that need this, they may just be trying to figure out how to do something as simple as adding an analyzer rule to a project, and don't have the luxury to be able to delay that work to spend weeks cobbling together a visualizer using an SDK that they may only have barely any knowledge with. There are certain things that don't inspire the kind of passion it takes for volunteers to do this, and therefore it's up to those who have a financial motive to do so. Whether it be the rent-seekers at JetBrains, or someone other than Microsoft and doesn't have an incentive to make a competing OS more viable for developers. Without the .NET foundation's governance model and funding (regardless of who funded it), it would have never made it this far. See: https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues/5276 reply paulirwin 5 hours agorootparent> Whether it be the rent-seekers at JetBrains This is a gratuitously negative comment that is unfair and uses an incorrect metaphor. Rent-seeking is trying to charge for something without providing any new value, usually from something already established as free. I don't believe Rider was ever available for free, but even if it was, they certainly have improved it with loads of new value since then. You're welcome to your opinion (that I don't share) that their IDEs are not worth the cost, but you're also free to not buy them. That's not rent-seeking, it's the free market. I personally am a big fan of Rider and the JetBrains Toolbox suite, and I get several times more value out of my subscription than it costs. YMMV. reply Jenk 46 minutes agorootparentprevMy full toolbox sub costs less than either my spotify or netflix subs do. Move along. reply vunderba 1 hour agorootparentprevOh for crying out loud, you could not have chosen a worst company to go after for the accusation of \"rent seeker.\" Jetbrains has offered perpetual fallback licenses for all of their products for years now. This means that as long as you don't need any of the new updates, you can purchase it for a one time fee (basically the equivalent of a single year's license) and then you own it. As far as their products not being worth what they charge, I pay about $180 per year (15$ / month) for the entire jetbrains library and consistently use CLion (for C and C++), Datagrip (postgres, mongo), Data rider (c#), Web storm (typescript), Phpstorm, and Pycharm. Considering these are the tools of my trade, that's more than a fair asking price. They've also been incredibly responsive, especially considering the massive upheavals within the company as a result of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Whenever I've filed an issue on youtrack, it usually gets a response, and often a bug ticket that's handled within a few version iterations later at most. reply phito 11 hours agorootparentprev> Literally zero ways to browse C# syntax trees available on the Mac.

They have a habit of shipping integrations that are only partially working, and then calling it a day (or the better part of a decade). By the way, Rider may have been cheaper if not for the above moves by Microsoft: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/505 reply kinjba11 2 hours agorootparentI pay $173 per year for JetBrain's 'All Products Pack'. Considering the salary I make as a software engineer, and the quality of the tools JetBrains provides, this is a great investment. Rider works flawlessly for me, far better than VS. As a side, it always strikes me as ironic that software developers are paid extremely well and yet hesitate to pay even a modest fee for the tools that enable them to do their job. Most \"free\" tools are not free - someone was paid to create them. IMO whether engineers are on a stable payroll is a differentiating aspect to why some tools succeed and become widely used and some don't. In the case of dev tools, our tech corporatocracy MAMA (Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Alphabet) pay engineers to make products like VS Code, then release for free. This is for eyeballs of course, because charging for the tools would get them nothing in comparison to their main platform revenue streams, which benefit hugely from the network effect. reply jayd16 3 hours agorootparentprevYour jetbrains hatred is so foreign to me. I think Rider is great and well worth the license. reply neonsunset 7 hours agorootparentprevFor organizations it is, for users it's $149 annually and then cheaper: https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/buy/?section=personal&billin... It is also free for OSS development, I maintain a couple of .NET libraries and applied for JetBrains free OSS license and they approved it within a week or so. On debugger - Rider uses its own debugger, they do not license it. Also, please do not link posts from Miguel De Icaza when he isn't in a good mood. He, unfortunately, does not provide constructive and/or unbiased criticism on .NET after moving out to Swift. I'm not sure what point you are trying to make but current day support for C# on macOS and Linux is very good. It is even in a better shape than many other languages that have been platform-agnostic from the start, yet still don't have such good debugger, static analysis and profiler options. reply paulirwin 5 hours agorootparentAnd for organizations, it's only $419 for the first year. It's $251/yr from 3+ years on. It should be noted that $419/year is $35/mo, which is still $10/mo cheaper than the Visual Studio 2022 Professional monthly subscription at $45/mo. $21/mo at 3+ years is less than half. reply Nuzzerino 7 hours agorootparentprevNot bad faith, these are issues I've been affected by first-hand.

It is one of my must haves. I usually upgrade to the latest one when I hit some framework feature or a piece of snippet which requires it. It started as a very reasonably priced for the paid edition and there was only one paid edition for a long time. Nowadays, it is a bit pricier and has several editions (a suggestion would be to merge Pro and Developer editions). I use LINQPad to manage my collection of snippets to do some ad hoc tasks on my machine. I also use it for testing out new code and learning about new features. It would be great when it becomes cross-platform, but last I heard Jo Albahari mentioned that the investment required was quite big and not worth it (at that time). On the side note, I had a chance to see Jo Albahari's presentation few years ago in Sydney and I think he is unsung hero of .NET world (along with Ayende)! reply xnorswap 12 hours agoprevA true essential tool. One of the few pieces of software for which I own a personal license. One of the useful features is that it keeps the executable running even after the script has finished, and will re-execute in the same process. This has some downsides and quirks (if you're not careful, you can double-initialize things like database connections), but has benefits for debugging. The newer versions have \"built in\" support for Benchmark.NET too which is a really nice feature for quickly proving code. reply alhsn 58 minutes agoprevAwsome tool which I used for a while.

I tried Polygot notebook a while back, but it kept crashing, so I un-installed it. reply rjbwork 21 hours agoprevGreat piece of software that I basically use for scripting/notebooking. Been writing C# so long it's my lingua franca and this tool lets me do pretty much everything (except actual shell scripting for use on e.g. build servers and deployment pipelines) in C#. reply gdev_gabe 16 hours agoparentnot sure if this is what you meant, but you can run linq files from the command line! reply rjbwork 3 hours agorootparentYeah for sure. I do set up crons on my local machine using linqpad scripts every now and then, because it's just my special little snowflake one off.

Sometimes PowerShell if I know I'm going to be running it on a Windows box anyway.

Roslyn handles VB.NET and C# with basically the same API. Adding PowerShell is akin to writing the core part of all that a second time. Not that it can't be done, but most of the time PowerShell itself is already a capable REPL, so I guess there's also less need for it in LINQPad. reply deanebarker 8 hours agoprevI use this constantly.

I’m not against it, I just don’t need it reply bertylicious 29 minutes agoparentThat's exactly the kind of thing I always hated about .net -- how the absence of a REPL forces me to create an executable for even the tiniest things. LINQPad solves this beautifully. Not sure if index ranges are inclusive or exclusive? Open LINQPad, double-click tab bar to open a new tab, type `\"0123\"[..^2]`, press ALT+X, done. I'd never go through the hassle to create an executable with VS for that, so instead I have to look up the documentation which is much more boring. And what's even better: countless times I was wondering what happens inside the framework and because LINQPad comes with ILSpy (I believe so, maybe you'll have to set it up) you can just F12 a framework method to see its source. reply liversage 10 hours agoparentprevOne of many useful features of LINQPad is the output visualizer (\"Dump\"). Granted, there are now NuGet packages (very likely inspired by LINQPad) that can do something similar in a console app but LINQPad is interactive, allows drill-down and can export to formats like Excel. It's such a productivity boost.

A lot of the Azure stuff like the whole automation is done with Powershell (or Python, but what Microsoft ops people does that?). On the development side of things Microsoft is pushing their container apps platform over their app/function platforms and it integrates with virtually everything. Even on something like their MSGraph SDKs we’re often getting better performance out of the JavaScript SDKs. I think it’s a little silly to say that Microsoft isn’t taking C# serious. If you look at Azure DevOps, which has not been taken very serious by Microsoft since they acquired GitHub and then compare it to C# there is just a world of difference. I do think it risks going that way. I’m not sure I think Visual Studio is taken fully serious anymore, but it’s still getting much more attention than Azure DevOps and C# is just… miles ahead of every product in terms of seriousness. I do think they are making it more and more like Typescript, I’m sure we’ll eventually see classes replaced by Types and functions being capable of living on their own, but that’s not really a bad thing. reply pjmlp 12 hours agorootparentprevDevDiv, nowadays part of Azure, is serious about .NET.

CDK Global, a company that provides software for thousands of auto dealers in the U.S. and Canada, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks on Wednesday, June 19, 2024. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Read More By WYATTE GRANTHAM-PHILIPS Updated 5:59 PM UTC, June 24, 2024 Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print NEW YORK (AP) — Car dealerships in North America continue to wrestle with major disruptions that started last week with cyberattacks on a software company used widely in the auto retail sales sector. CDK Global, a company that provides software for thousands of auto dealers in the U.S. and Canada, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks Wednesday. That led to an outage that has continued to impact operations. For prospective car buyers, that’s meant delays at dealerships or vehicle orders written up by hand. There’s no immediate end in sight, with CDK saying it expects the restoration process to take “several days” to complete. On Monday, Group 1 Automotive Inc., a $4 billion automotive retailer, said that it continued to use “alternative processes” to sell cars to its customers. Lithia Motors and AutoNation, two other dealership chains, also disclosed that they implemented workarounds to keep their operations going. Here is what you need to know. What is CDK Global? CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. The company, based just outside of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, provides software technology to dealers that helps with day-to-day operations — like facilitating vehicle sales, financing, insurance and repairs. RELATED COVERAGE Car dealerships are being disrupted by a multi-day outage after cyberattacks on software supplier So long plastic air pillows: Amazon shifting to recycled paper filling for packages in North America 1 Malaysian climber dead, 1 rescued near the top of Denali, North America’s tallest mountain CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America, according to the company. What happened last week? CDK experienced back-to-back cyberattacks on Wednesday. The company shut down all of its systems out of an abundance of caution, spokesperson Lisa Finney said last week. “We have begun the restoration process,” Finney said in an update over the weekend — noting that the company had launched an investigation into the “cyber incident” with third-party experts and notified law enforcement. “Based on the information we have at this time, we anticipate that the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them with alternate ways to conduct business,” she added. In messages to its customers, the company has also warned of “bad actors” posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system access by contacting customers. It urged them to be cautious of any attempted phishing. The incident bore all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, in which targets are asked to pay a ransom to access encrypted files. But CDK declined to comment directly — neither confirming or denying if it had received a ransom demand. Are impacted dealerships still selling cars? Several major auto companies — including Stellantis, Ford and BMW — confirmed to The Associated Press last week that the CDK outage had impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue. In light of the ongoing situation, a spokesperson for Stellantis said Friday that many dealerships had switched to manual processes to serve customers. That includes writing up orders by hand. A Ford spokesperson added that the outage may cause “some delays and inconveniences at some dealers and for some customers.” However, many Ford and Lincoln customers are still getting sales and service support through alternative routes being used at dealerships. Group 1 Automotive Inc., which owns 202 automotive dealerships, 264 franchises, and 42 collision centers in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, said Monday that the incident has disrupted its business applications and processes in its U.S. operations that rely on CDK’s dealers’ systems. The company said that it took measures to protect and isolate its systems from CDK’s platform. All Group 1 U.S. dealerships will continue to conduct business using alternative processes until CDK’s dealers’ systems are available, the company said Monday. Group 1’s dealerships in the U.K. don’t use CDK’s dealers’ systems and are not impacted by the incident. In regulatory filings, Lithia Motors and AutoNation disclosed that last week’s incident at CDK had disrupted their operations as well. Lithia said it activated cyber incident response procedures, which included “severing business service connections between the company’s systems and CDK’s.” AutoNation said it also took steps to protect its systems and data — adding that all of its locations remain open “albeit with lower productivity,” as many are served manually or through alternative processes. With many details of the cyberattacks still unclear, customer privacy is also at top of mind — especially with little known about what information may have been compromised this week. In a statement last week, Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said “dealers are very committed to protecting their customer information” and were seeking updates from CDK to determine the scope of impact “so they can respond appropriately.” Cybersecurity experts have stressed that consumers connected to CDK (or a CDK-affilated dealership) should assume that their data may have been breached. Those impacted should monitor their credit — or even consider freezing their credit as an added layer of defense — and be wary of any suspicious phishing messages.

Some can't. - Parts and service are in worse shape than new vehicle sales because their inventory info is in the CDK system. - The process by which new cars and parts are ordered and delivered to dealers is down. - Many dealerships can sell what's on the lot and do repairs with parts in inventory, but the supply chain has stopped.

The digital world feels increasingly dangerous and ephemeral. If I have something written with ink on paper I have certain guarantees: I know that it's accessible even if the power is completely out. I know that it won't randomly get deleted if my hard drive suddenly dies. I know that the only way someone can read its contents are if they get physical access to that piece of paper. I know that it's not being automatically scanned by a platform provider to comply with government surveillance laws. I know that any alteration to the document would require physical access to it and would most likely leave a visible trace. There are technologies that if applied would provide some or most of these guarantees and even provide increased safety, but I don't trust any existing SaaS providers to give me any of them out of the box, and the average person doesn't have the skill to string tools together to get them. And so here we are: in 2024, anything not printed on paper still cannot be fully trusted. reply Animats 10 minutes agoparent> I write these words in steel, for anything not set in metal cannot be trusted.

Is that done on purpose? reply animex 1 hour agorootparentMany of these thermal and carbon transfer receipt printers have poor ink/print life. I doubt it was done on purpose as most of these systems are sold by 3rd parties to retailers. I'm sure the issue has been raised but then they willing thought to themselves, yeah actually this benefits us, let's just \"pretend to ignore\" the issue. More modern retailers are offering receipt-email options which is the option I choose if available, that way I have a \"permanent\" record of the transaction. I recently did some old taxes from 7 years ago and this feature was invaluable as most online portals no longer offered the records. reply j_4 1 hour agorootparentprevNot likely. It's just a technical limitation of thermal paper. That's the trade-off for cheap, tiny form factor, fast, and low maintenance printing. reply hansvm 1 hour agorootparentprevThe other answers mentioned _what_ happened. In terms of next steps: (1) Generally, receipts should be scanned (and perhaps re-printed, depending on your needs) for any sort of conservation effort. The heat from scanning (not in any modern tech, just as an FYI so you can decide for yourself) can cause the same degredation. It doesn't necessarily take a long time either. If you ever order a pizza where the driver tucked the receipt in the box you'll also notice that chunk of the receipt is illegible. (2) If it's partially visible in its current state, you can probably get away with increasing the contrast and applying a decent OCR to the result. You'll get some hallucinations, but if you fill in the most likely characters conforming to the grammar of a typical receipt you're likely to be in the right ballpark (if you need a particular warranty code or something you might have to manually try a few options for particularlly blurry letters). Pair that with a photo of the receipt in its current state for any distrusting shopkeeps. reply jakub_g 4 minutes agorootparentprevIt usually disappears way faster than that, often ater a year or two.

The objective is achieved in a roundabout way: the statutes written prevent the establishment of physical dealership locations owned by the manufacturers. They are not broad enough to restrict direct sales. This means that some creative sales techniques can be used, if you: (a) don't need to have cars in a lot, (b) can sell online, (c) tolerate some uncertainty while interpretation of status is fought in court. Then, you can (in many states), sell cars directly. Tesla does all 3 as they usually don't have (a) inventory and in some cases, the law doesnt prohibit showrooms (b) seem perfectly comfortable selling you the car online (and critically, customers are ok with this too) and (c) have money to fight for settlement of the issues. Theres even more creative sales now - tesla is actively setting up sales ops in Indian reservations - which have their own sets of the laws outside of specific states. Edit: added (c) which is certainly an important factor in many states reply tejohnso 2 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't just about everyone hate dealing with a dealership?

Elections put people and parties into power, not individual ideas. reply Sohcahtoa82 2 hours agorootparentprevNot when dealers pay politicians to keep it that way. Even if you ran a petition and forced a state ballot measure, dealers would run a propaganda campaign to make it sound like a pro-Tesla measure. reply AlexandrB 1 hour agorootparentprevI think that's true for tech savvy nerds, but my mom loves her dealership.

She's still paying for it! reply tracker1 2 hours agorootparentprevIt depends. Most jurisdictions allow for a ballot referendum to put measures to a popular vote. This has gotten more difficult with signatory requirements that have gotten larger in most states, mostly orchestrated to keep the dominant parties in power and limit grass roots efforts in general. Going through existing congressional process means getting at least a champion on board and overcoming dis/misinformation from many insider corporations, often large local donors. edit: From my understanding,successful campaigns via referendum tend to cost anywhere from $2-20 million usd. Often involving paid signature gathering and local advertising. reply kbolino 1 hour agorootparentThe \"problem\" with referenda is they often forcibly enact policies that the elected politicians, judges, bureaucrats, and other organized political actors don't want. Since these people decide what the government actually does, they often find ways to ignore, work around, or in some cases outright overturn, \"settled\" referendum results. Making it more difficult to get questions on the ballot outside of the ordinary political process is just streamlining things from their perspective. reply DANmode 2 hours agorootparentprevToo bad it's a Republic. reply dragonwriter 1 hour agorootparent“Republic” (any system in which top-level government offices aren't personal property of the officeholder) and “Democracy” (any system in which government serves and is accountable to the general population—usually through voting on candidates and/or specific policies—rather than vice versa) are not mutually exclusive. It’s pretty common for modern Western governments to be both of (Democratic, often also Federal) Republic and (Representative, sometimes with minor areas of Direct) Democracy. reply vundercind 13 minutes agorootparentTo put a finer point on it: actual experts in the study of government routinely refer to the US as a democracy.

It's intentionally breaking up vertical integration. reply mywittyname 1 hour agorootparentprevCar dealerships exist in what is probably the most favorable regulatory environment of any business. It's a side effect of owners of car dealerships often being the wealthiest people in a locale, and being politically active. If you look up donations to your local and state politicians, you'll probably find several of the largest donors have last names that happen to match that of the local Ford or Chevy dealership network. They have rules that protect them from competition from manufactures, rules that protect them from them from competition from other dealerships (i.e., Ford can't allow a dealership to open across the street from one they don't like), in many states, there are special rules for inheriting a dealership. reply lotsofpulp 2 hours agorootparentprevNo, they only exist because state laws prevented manufacturers from selling directly to customers. reply kube-system 2 hours agorootparentThey'd originally existed because manufacturers didn't have enough resources to sell directly to customers, and they'd probably still exist (in a smaller capacity) today even if manufacturers could sell direct. Because there still are some manufacturers that sell low enough volumes in the US that it would probably still financially make sense for them to lean on a dealer network. But for sure, Ford, GM, Toyota, Stellantis, etc would probably love to sell direct. reply bcrosby95 1 hour agorootparentprevSo you're saying dealerships are more of a monopoly than manufacturers selling directly to customers? reply toomuchtodo 3 hours agoparentprevI encourage a complaint to be filed. https://www.justice.gov/atr/complaint-center https://www.ftc.gov/advice-guidance/competition-guidance/ant... reply hubraumhugo 2 hours agoparentprevMy entrepreneurial mind immediately thinks: Let's create a better solution to revolutionize this industry and make the old, expensive incumbents obsolete.

Often a challenger will come in and snag a few smaller deals but the Monopoly has a plethora of options to swat it away - rev up their larger more experienced product team to compete, lobby for regulation, poach from the challenger, acquire the challenger, tank prices in the one area the challenger has traction, and much more. reply lainga 2 hours agorootparentI read a particularly disgusting book called \"Competitive Strategy\" by Michael E.

Both DMSes have been around since the '70s or so, so they're probably considered a safe option by a lot of dealers. reply n4r9 2 hours agorootparentAh, you're correct. However, the linked litigation doc argues that the two have an agreement not to compete with each other. It also explains that it's very disruptive for a dealership business to transition to a new data management system. reply juliangoldsmith 1 hour agorootparentI believe the litigation was about data integration, due to the mentions of Authenticom. Authenticom was a vendor my company used until we needed to start getting data directly from R&R. (IIRC we were a third party on a lawsuit related to that.) Switching DMSes is likely disruptive, but is still pretty common. We've had dealerships do it every now and then. reply blorenz 2 hours agorootparentprevIs R&R still that large? A few NADAs ago I approached them to see about getting a direct integration. Only one of my customers was R&R at that time. ReyRey acted very elitist and told me that they had no interest. Fast forward to this last NADA where I approached ReyRey again with only three customers. I asked them if we could integrated with three and they stated that they would even do a single customer. Quite the change of tune. I asked ballpark what it would be and they said \"low 5 digits\". Not even CDK is that expensive with their certification process. This will also be interesting to see how it affects their their long in-development and repeatedly stalled Fortellis product. They are attempting to release it as a DMS agnostic solution which I did not think that other DMSes will gravitate to just because it comes out of CDK. This attack is just another reason for a competitor DMS to not use it. reply juliangoldsmith 1 hour agorootparentR&R is still one of the largest. The elitism was definitely something I saw when I wrote the RCI integration at Dealer Wizard around 2014. I've heard they've been trying to change the culture internally. I'm not sure how that's going, but it'd certainly be welcome. Does Fortellis even accept other DMSes? I've dealt with it a bit to integrate with eLeads (now CDK CRM), but there didn't seem to be much on there apart from CDK's APIs. reply WarOnPrivacy 3 hours agoparentprev> CDK Global has massive market share 90% when measured by number of vehicles sold I suspect we're missing some nuance in that 90%.

My product's customer are car dealerships and most of my customers are on CDK. This is definitely creating a void of data for them though fortunately my product won't fail without the expected DMS data. In terms of opportunity, dealers had paperwork that would be generated for the F/I department from CDK which I was able to port into my SaaS and prefill with data we can capture at the time of sale. All the praise is due for FOSS like `pdf-lib` that I was able to incorporate in a matter of a few hours. All the disdain for Adobe Acrobat Pro which fought me tooth and nail when converting their paperwork to fillable PDF forms ( - if you're the Product Manager on that then please get a UX audit of it!)

The dealer could not positively affirm that they did or did not have a particular model in their inventory, so the salesman and I wandered around the lot for ten minutes before deciding they did not.

Googling tells me the average car salesman sells 8-10 cars per month. Maybe more for a 'high volume' dealership but certainly less than 1 car per day. I would think the paperwork to sell a single car would take substantially less than 8 hours for an experienced worker to complete. reply josefresco 2 hours agorootparentMy last car purchase took 14 hours total. 2 separate days, was buying new, no trade-in.

Typically the sales guy is eager to finish (just wants to sell his next car) but the paperwork is where things get really slow. The entire time I was thinking how much of a \"waste of time\" this all was for the sales guy. He really didn't do much after the initial 2 hours of sales time, just \"held our hands\" while the paperwork was processed. bee_rider 2 hours agorootparentprevThe paperwork to do one transaction might not be too bad, but keeping all the inventory on pencil and paper seems like a pain. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparentIt'd be a pain at the multi-dealership-network level, sure. But an individual dealership has what, 50 cars in stock? That seems easily manageable to me. I'm old enough that I've seen far larger operations running on paper. Of course, the days of paper-based paperwork did require businesses to employ diligent and numerate clerks, and to have filing cabinets, manual calculators, photocopiers, whiteout, and suchlike. I suppose they could have run into some challenges around that sort of thing. reply HeyLaughingBoy 46 minutes agorootparent> 50 cars in stock?

These aren't systems with short setup times and there is major risk to trying to replatform you're accounting system. How do you pull of an ERP migration while you're existing one is down? Further, almost everything the dealer does from inventory management to service is integrated to this system of record either directly or via data integrations. Some of the smaller mom-and-pop stores just use small business accounting systems like quickbooks but those get pretty tedious to maintain with any sizable number of sales or employees per month. reply toomuchtodo 3 hours agorootparentprevMy hot take is auto dealers are a notoriously painful enterprise sales cycle due to network effects aka \"good 'ol boys\" club (anecdotally from folks in tech who have to deal in this industry). reply SoftTalker 3 hours agorootparentMany are also not tech-savvy. Many dealerships are inherited within a family that has owned them since the 1950s if not longer. They are cash cows for the owners and there's little motivation to try new things.

The software/cloud solutions promised streamlined, painless transfers, but those benefits never really materialized due to the amount of HIPA-compliancy issues (the details around this pain point are fuzzy).

With digital systems, this can be mitigated (rate limiting, encryption and least privilege information sharing, audit logs etc.) to an extent. With paper, you're screwed. I still remember a few years ago walking on a street in a city in Easter Europe, behind a bank office for a bank which no longer exists.

It's not like these dealers are making ford vehicles or getting different prices from the manufacture. The competition is that besides ford there's going to be a GM, stellates, and Audi lot (probably). If we want more competition, we get it not by having dealers competing over who can screw you the most with the best hidden fee, we get it by adding more car manufacturers. reply tomatotomato37 2 hours agorootparentprevThe difference is those places could be relocated to where all the other warehouses are, out in the boonies, rather in the city where we want housing and business.

The idea was \"if you buy a VinFast\" from vinfast and they exit the market, you're 100% hosed, but if you buy a VinFast from \"Karl Marx VinFast and Fiskar Dealerships of North Idaho\" you can go back and talk to KMoNI Inc about your new car. The dealership model was established a very long time ago back in the cambrian explosion era of car manufacterers and people were buying cars from companies like Auburn, Cole, Crow, Davis, Dixie, Durant, Elcar, Grant, King, Kline, Lafayette, Kurtz, Marmon, Mercer, Overland, Peerless, Pilot, Roamer, Saxon, Stearns, Velie, Wescott and Winton [1] and then the company would vanish and there would be no support.

I agree with you though, I just don't love the entire model of dealerships being that some local person just wants to run their own business and this is the easiest. So little brand or experience consistency across dealerships and so much perception that the person benefiting most from your transaction is the dealership itself.

From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_dealership > They have considerable political influence and have lobbied for regulations that guarantee their survival and profitability. By 2010, all US states had laws that prohibited manufacturers from side-stepping independent car dealerships and selling cars directly to consumers. By 2009, most states imposed restrictions on the creation of new dealerships to compete with incumbent dealerships. reply kristjansson 2 hours agorootparentDealerships are more entrenched, but the economics aren't that different from big box stores selling white goods, bike shops selling bikes, etc. Retailing is hard, expensive, and idiosyncratic; providing adequate after sale service is worse. A manufacturer might reasonably prefer to make and market cars, while shuffling the inventory risk and retailing cost off to someone else. reply toast0 2 hours agoparentprevI'm not in love with dealerships, but one thing that a dealership does is provide final QA on inbound cars. They don't catch everything, but they do catch some of the things that slipped through QA at time of manufacture. It's somewhat telling that Tesla has a bad reputation for delivered quality, and they don't have a dealership network that does final QA. Of course, dealerships also like to install unnecessary options while they're doing the other parts of dealer prep, so it's a mixed bag. reply legitster 3 hours agoparentprevIt is kind of a crazy model. You don't go to the Pepsi store for Pepsi and the Coke store for Coke. The exclusivity dealerships get enshrined in law is kinda nuts. Still, I think there is something to be said for independent dealerships overall for service quality. Trying to get a Tesla serviced is still something of a nightmare. In comparison the service departments of dealerships have are much more robust. reply kube-system 3 hours agorootparentI'm not sure that's a good comparison. There are several middlemen before you buy a Coke or Pepsi. Usually, your soft drink is manufactured from the brand's syrup by a bottling partner, which is then distributed to a retailer, who you buy it from. e.g: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/content/dam/company/us/en/a... reply legitster 2 hours agorootparentI used to work for Pepsi-Co so I am well aware of how their distribution works. But in this case, at the point of retail it makes no difference. The store can sell as many different brands as they want. The problem is not the middlemen, it's the exclusivity arrangements that disincentivize brand competition. reply bigstrat2003 2 hours agorootparentUnfortunately the soda business isn't free of noxious exclusivity deals either. Restaurants almost never have both Coke and Pepsi products, it's either one or the other. As I understand it that's because restaurants get a lower price if they agree to exclusively offer one brand. reply kube-system 2 hours agorootparentprevThen you should be aware that Pepsi/Coke are notorious for their exclusivity agreements in some of their retail channels e.g. I drank Coke products in my undergrad because of my school's exclusivity agreement. reply gpm 3 hours agorootparentprevEveryone I know IRL never gets their car serviced at the actual dealership, always going to a third party repair shop.

New cars under warranty pretty much go to the dealer. Dealers actually don't know much about their older cars. Try to bring for example a 1990's era (or really anything more than 10 years old or so) Mercedes to a dealer for service, none of their techs have any idea what it is, unless they happen to have an old guy. Dealership shops are trained and reasonably competent working on newer stuff that's under warranty coverage.

I also just recently test drove a lower trim / different engine/transmission configuration vehicle than I wanted, because that configuration was available to test drive and the desired one wasn't... and I was pleasantly surprised by the drivability, so I broadened my search (helps that the configuration I wanted is more expensive and less produced; it's easier to compromise towards something that I might be able to buy for less) reply itsoktocry 2 hours agorootparentprev>We buy so many things \"sight unseen\" because of the quality and reliability.

Maybe the document is from a FOIA request or something similar (and therefore not public)? > The US EPA notified her they finalized the report but are currently unable to share it with her as Apple apparently declared the report of their (assumed) numerous environmental violations is Apple Confidential. Gjovik has a pending FOIA request as well. reply murderfs 11 hours agoprevThe author of this has been on a crusade against Apple for years, stemming from an incident that was probably hypochondria. They've outright lied about multiple incidents (see https://twitter.com/shantinix/status/1433297575914971136), and I would very strongly doubt any new claims made. For example, a spot check of one of the claims has them currently saying \"Still, Gjovik’s limited testing returned results showing a number of the chemicals in use by Apple at ARIA including Acetone, Acetonitrile, Acetaldehyde, Benzene, 1,2-Dichloroethane, Ethanol, Ethylbenzene, Hexane, Isopropanol, Isopropyl toluene, Methylene Chloride, Toluene, and Xylene.\" But, in 2021 (at https://sfbayview.com/2021/03/i-thought-i-was-dying-my-apart...), \"I wanted to get some formal data in the brief time before I moved out, so I hired an industrial hygienist to sample the indoor air and some of the topsoil. Despite the $1,555 I had to pay for it, the results were inconclusive.\" reply cjk2 11 hours agoparentThis is in line of when I worked in a semiconductor lab in suburban UK in the 90s. We had a couple of local residents report problems immediately even though we hadn't even started fabrication at that point. They eventually sent out a press release saying that we had moved manufacturing to Scotland. The complaints stopped instantly. The lab was running until at least 2017 with no complaints and regular inspections from local authorities. YMMV but some people are crazy. The EPA is however not. But what the EPA say and what the woman claims are disparate. Edit: to be clear I'd expect the EPA to install independently maintained monitoring equipment which is not subject to the bias of Apple or the reporter. Then collect more data! reply vineyardmike 11 hours agorootparent> YMMV but some people are crazy. The EPA is however not. But what the EPA say and what the woman claims are disparate. To complicate it further, this woman did in fact live on top of an industrially-zone area which had industrial contamination on site. The apartments are very new (finished construction in ~2019) and they had to agree to a ton of cleanup to get permits to build. There are so many confounding factors that mean she could still have been poisoned by toxic industrial byproducts and the factor next door could still be innocent. reply jldugger 1 hour agorootparentI'm honestly surprised the area is zoned for residential; the central expressway corridor has lots of industry nearby, including Intel. Plus that apt complex is right next the intersection of a major highway and major expressway, which won't be helping anyone breathe. But she's not the only resident and I haven't heard any indication of a class action. reply cjk2 11 hours agorootparentprevWell it would require more data which is the problem, and something I outlined elsewhere. Is she the only person complaining? The case is put forward as if that is the case. If that is the case then there is little evidence to discard the null hypothesis that there's nothing wrong and either alternate hypothesis that it's the Apple facility or the previously contaminated site seem very unlikely. reply synctext 10 hours agorootparent> many confounding factors Indeed. May 2022 TechCruch [0] about sexism at workplace: \"Privacy watchdogs in Europe are considering a complaint against Apple made by a former employee, Ashley Gjøvik, who alleges the company fired her after she raised a number of concerns, internally and publicly, including over the safety of the workplace.\" \"At the time, Gjøvik had been placed on administrative leave by Apple after raising concerns about sexism in the workplace, and a hostile and unsafe working environment which it had said it was investigating.\" [0] https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/11/gobbler-complaint-europe/?... reply npteljes 10 hours agorootparentprevSimilar hysteria surrounds the 5G rollout as well. I remember anecdotes of people reporting health issues, when the already erected tower wasn't even on, but unfortunately I can't find the source for this again. In general, I find that people are hit or miss regarding their observations. Sometimes they are so on point that they seem like a savant, and sometimes they miss the mark so hard that I find believing anything further impossible. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G_misinformation#List_of_prot... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_testimony reply cjk2 10 hours agorootparent5G was a fun one.

I moved and I have 5G but they still don't. reply npteljes 9 hours agorootparentThis is exactly the type of story I remember reading about too. I feel the best type of public education would have been the listing of the many electromagnetic radiation sources we already have. Taking a sample person, say, from inner London, and enumerate just how many of the radiation gets to them already, from the 4G and previous sources, radio, the different equipment that a city has, and so on. I feel like people are missing the historical context is these cases, same with the COVID vaccine.

It says right in their report the facility is being properly managed by the city of Santa Clara and the state of California. Also, they weren't doing chip fab there. It was R&D for Titan and MicroLED. There's a reason she's litigating her case against Apple pro se and without any expert witnesses and other lawyers.

One of the best examples are cancer clusters. There have been examples of well-understood (almost certainly causal) cancers caused by industrial occupation, but cancer is common enough that some things that look causal are purely coincidental. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls was almost certainly causal, while \"high voltage electrical lines cause cancer\" probably is not (https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/health/long-after-an-80s-...)

I currently have a chronic scalp condition that doctors haven’t really identified and a really stiff neck. Of course I’m going to go ‘aha!’ If someone gives me a plausible explanation reply reaperman 11 hours agoparentprevIt's really hard to \"catch\" these things in the moment. I work in chemical plants and there are tons of huge releases of extremely toxic gases all the time, which I can often smell from my apartment. I know what they are by smell because I manufacture them myself. Proper continuous monitoring for a broad range of chemicals would cost about $1 million per monitoring station and we'd need to build them along the perimeters of each plant so that leaks can be assigned to the offending companies, and they need to be built near housing so that we know how families are being affected. That sounds expensive, but really isn't that much added cost for a $100 million to $10 billion manufacturing site. I live in the western hemisphere's largest integrated industrial complex (Freeport, TX integrated with the eastern edge of Houston as well). Note that Freeport, TX has ZERO state or federal EPA VOC analyzers which can actually detect which chemical is leaking. They can only detect \"this amount of something with either {sulfur, N-O bonds, aromatic carbon rings} -- no clue what precisely though!\". This is the same capability of the most advanced atmospheric pollution satellites. Completely fucking useless for an area which manufactures something like 15-20% of all USA domestic chemicals. The technology to measure individual chemicals exists, but the government isn't paying for it or installing it. The ENTIRE east side of Houston metropolitan area is dedicated to or \"next door\" to massive chemical manufacturing. This is an industrial area nearly equal to the area encompassing all of Seattle+Bellevue+Redmond+Renton+Tukwila. That's not including nearby housing - that's just how big the manufacturing facilities themselves are! This massive area has only THREE air quality monitors which test for these kinds of chemicals[0]. During huge major events like the ITC fire[2], they typically show no increased pollution at all, which proves that it's woefully inadequate even during big emergencies that very obviously affect breathing air quality. I lived next to leaks every day and because I worked in the plants I knew the smells - one day acrylates, next day thiols, next day hydrocarbons, etc. But all 3 monitoring sites (over 10 miles from me) showed nothing at all. Here is the one \"correct\" monitoring station near the chemical plants of Houston: [0]... but several of its analyzers are often offline/broken/pending maintenance. Here's a map of all the other ones: [1] Generally single/dual color dots mark \"not-useful\" monitoring sites which might measure only PM2.5 or Ozone, for example. The 4+ color dots are generally useful, they measure specific (large) families of chemicals so you can see very roughly what is leaking, even if it doesn't have \"soot\" in it. The data used by ProPublica[3] is actually far worse than the woefully inadequate data collected by TCEQ/EPA air monitoring stations -- because what ProPublica used was \"self-reported\" data from the chemical plants. But I know from working in them and living next to them that many leaks are never reported and many leaks are never even known internally! Our government's data collection is a travesty. ProPublica couldn't use the real air quality measurements because having 2-3 points across 1000 mi^2 is completely useless for the wind models they wanted to apply to the problem. We don't actually have any data. The government is failing us.

I suspect that 4 years of living next to the plant has caused long-term damage ... but it's extremely difficult to prove anything, especially when there is no data at all that supports an assertion that my apartment was exposed to any leaks at all - not a single one of those near-daily emissions events was caught by the air quality monitoring stations, only a few were voluntarily reported to the EPA, and all of the emissions are permitted by the EPA / TCEQ either on an ongoing basis or one-off \"forgiveness\" basis after voluntary pro-active reporting. In one unit that I personally worked in and was responsible for, an intern was analyzing our procedures for emptying our tanks of waste products and realized that we had been \"illegally\" venting (without a permit) a lot of vapor from a waste tank every couple weeks when the liquid was full and needed to be emptied into trucks for proper disposal. We told the state regulatory authority that we realized we were out of compliance, and asked for permission to continue doing it this way until we had time to fix it. We got permission to continue doing what we were doing for another 2 years, with options for additional extensions. So the \"illegal\" emissions became \"legal\" overnight once we reported ourselves, and there were no consequences for the 10+ years of \"illegal\" emissions. This is very typical - in general if a company \"self-reports\", they do not face any punishments, but will face some small punishments if the regulatory agencies are the ones who find the problem. This encourages companies to be upfront about acknowledging, reporting, and (eventually) fixing their own problems. One woman I know worked in a facility that produced a chemical known to cause issues with pregnancies, and suffered 4 miscarriages while trying for a baby before she simply refused to go out into the plant she ran at all during her fifth pregnancy, which she successfully brought to term. It's still not cut-and-dry that the chemicals caused her miscarriages, and there's no hard \"evidence\" that she was even exposed to those chemicals at all, or in concentrations above EPA limits. Unless a pipe bursts suddenly and coats you with a chemical and sends you to a hospital, it's very difficult to prove that you were ever really \"exposed\" to the chemical. Even if you do get an obvious harmful exposure, it's difficult to assign any long-term consequences to that particular exposure. reply Afforess 11 hours agoparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] dang 1 hour agorootparentPosting like this will get you banned here.

It's certainly possible, and it certainly happens, but every individual case is a sample size of one, and the best we can say is it's likely an environmental factor played a part. On top of this, it seems the claimant has either through frustration or with malicious intent exaggerated or fabricated some of the claims. So, I'll agree with you to be highly skeptical. On the other hand, it's entirely reasonable to assume that a large corporation would maximize its profits: it has a duty to.

The foremost trustworthy party is the EPA. Note, I am not a lawyer or anyone who could professionally give an opinion on this.* The most egregious violation the author purports Apple did is the illegal venting of hazardous chemicals. IMHO, the most plausible evidence supporting the author's claim can be found in the (redacted) EPA report in observation #11.[1] My understanding is that waste streams (hazardous materials being vented into the environment) must be accounted for in order to accurately calculate how often you must change carbon filters (called breakthrough time in the report) and that carbon filters lose efficacy as hazardous gasses are passed through it. Anyways, the report found that Apple did not account for all the waste they were putting through the filters and thus could not accurately assess the \"breakthrough time\" of the filters. There is a plausible case that could be made that a filter had reached its \"breakthrough time\" -- potentially leaking hazardous gases into the environment. This reportedly has been occurring since atleast* Dec 2020, which could be around the time the author moved in which was also 2020 (unspecified range). 1. https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/312oqvretg7yyhfx0ohx4/AGZduVX... reply PROgrammerTHREE 5 hours agoparentThe problem is that the EPA report doesn't say what she says it does. 1. Apple doesn't do chip fab at Scott Blvd. They did R&D for Titan and microLED screens and were part of the layoffs in April. 2. The EPA says that they didn't have permits WITH THE EPA, but were permitted with California and Santa Clara County/City. 3. She says the carbon filters weren't changed, not the EPA. 4. She says Apple said materials weren't hazardous waste, but the report says they were labeled \"California Waste\", meaning they weren't properly reporting the materials to the EPA, but were to the state of California. 5. How is it this woman was nearly killed, while the employees who WORK in the building are perfectly healthy, the next door businesses have no sick employees, and the other thousands of residents in the apartment building are also not sick? 6.

But it is a big deal when they do spout green initiatives then get busted for stuff like this. Notice some of those dates? How absent does corporate have to be to allow stuff like this? Months and months on end with no real inspections? If Apple was as green as they say, this wouldn't have happened in the first place. They would understand these types of messes. So while the main cause may fall on some of the daily employees, where was management? Why weren't they doing their job as responsible environmental stewards as their image upholds? Again, IMO this isn't _that_ big of a deal so long as they stop those practices and get their stuff together. No amount of handwaving/whataboutisms is going to change this.

For example, violation #6 appears to be about a tank holding diluted solvents such as isopropyl alcohol, acetone, and NMP. And the violation is that they labeled it as \"CA-133\" waste while it should be also labeled as \"D001\" waste because it's flammable. That's shitty, but I don't see how that could've poisoned someone from afar. You don't want to huff these solvents, but they are common and have modest toxicity. Or, take violation #2: a bucket labeled \"adhesive liquids and tape\", which should've been closed but wasn't. Violation #3 is that a bucket labeled \"silicone\" has been on the site for more than 90 days. And on, and on.

    "originBody": "How traffic noise hurts children's brains 1 day ago By Olivia Howitt, Share Emmanuel Lafont/BBC Children are particularly vulnerable to noise pollution from traffic (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC) As awareness grows of the toll noise has on children's health and learning, some cities show the way to quieter roads and classrooms. In a New York classroom, noise levels were so high that the teacher had to scream to be heard. The classroom was located near a subway train on raised tracks which passed by Public School 98 in Manhattan about 15 times a day, causing constant interruptions in the learning process. For many years, people had complained about the noise levels at Public School 98, and in 1975, Arline Bronzaft, associate professor of psychology at Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York, published a study examining the impact of noise on children's reading ability. She found that students who sat on the noisy side of the school building adjacent to the tracks performed poorly on reading tests compared to those on the quiet side of the building. The average reading scores of the classes on the noisy side lagged three to four months behind those of students on the quieter side. As a result of Bronzaft's findings, the Transit Authority installed rubber pads on the tracks to reduce noise, and the Board of Education equipped classrooms with sound-absorbing materials to create a better learning environment. Emmanuel Lafont/BBC Excessive noise has a detrimental impact on children's health and development (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC) Noise pollution is a growing global problem. As populations increase, so do the noise levels that form the urban soundscape. The UN has warned that urban noise pollution is becoming a \"global public health menace\", which already leads to 12,000 premature deaths each year in the European Union, and affects an estimated 100 million Americans. Environmental noise, particularly road traffic noise but also aircraft noise, is among the most damaging environmental factors to health, after air pollution. Such noise has been found to increase chronic stress and cause disturbed sleep and higher blood pressure. Noise and noise annoyance have been associated with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, and noise exposure has also been associated with a greater diabetes risk. Loud noise from sources such as music through headphones, motorcycles and even leafblowers, can over time lead to hearing loss and tinnitus. Defined as unwanted or disturbing sounds, noise pollution from increasing traffic and crowded schools, can also have a detrimental impact on babies' and children's health and development. This is particularly true for children from low socio-economic backgrounds, who are exposed to higher levels of environmental noise. From Buenos Aires to Barcelona, cities have started introducing measures to tackle noise pollution, protect children's health, and prioritise pedestrians by improving inner city green spaces, reducing speed limits and introducing sound meters. Deafening roads In the US and European Union, road, rail and aircraft traffic are the dominant sources of noise pollution. A 2022 study found that road traffic noise experienced by primary school children in Barcelona, Spain, slowed down their working memory and attention span, which is considered essential for many aspects of learning including problem-solving, reasoning, mathematics, and language comprehension. Emmanuel Lafont/BBC Road traffic noise slows down children's working memory and attention span (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC) The study tested 2,700 children aged between seven and 10 years in 38 schools in Barcelona, Spain, four times a year. The researchers measured the external noise, at specific points within each classroom, repeating the process six months later to determine the average baseline level of noise pollution. Over the course of a year, the team performed online cognitive tests to evaluate the children's short-term memory and attentiveness every three months. Noise can negatively affect children's brains during crucial stages of development The Barcelona study, which built on previous research, found that noise levels generated by road, air and rail traffic can have a negative impact on children's cognitive function during the crucial stages of brain development. Unwanted noise in the classroom can cause a child to experience several possible negative responses, such as learned helplessness – low motivation to learn due to the lack of control in their environment – and impaired attention, the study found. How loud is too loud? • The World Health Organization recommends noise levels do not exceed 35 decibels in classrooms. • In primary schools, average noise levels are 44 decibels when pupils are silent, 56 decibels when pupils are engaged in quiet activities, 65 decibels for individual work, such as working at tables where some talking is allowed, and 70-77 decibels for group work. • Noise-induced hearing loss occurs after prolonged exposure to high levels of noise, exceeding 85 decibels. The Barcelona study was the first to investigate the impact of exposure to noise fluctuation. The researchers found that sudden fluctuations of noise, from traffic outside the classroom, such as car honks or engine revving, were more likely to distract children, and cause them to miss important information, even at a lower than average noise level. Maria Foraster, lead author of the study, researcher in epidemiology and an expert on noise and health, says the researchers decided to focus on noise fluctuations as there are no international guidelines in place that measure this. The World Health Organization recommends less than 35 decibels of noise in classrooms to ensure good teaching and learning conditions. Over half of Barcelona's population is exposed to noise levels over 65 decibels between 8am and 10pm. \"The guidelines don't [mention] fluctuations and peaks. Every time there is a noise peak, it is a distraction which can affect children's attention [span] and working memory,\" says Foraster. Another study by Foraster found that excessive exposure to environmental noise could interfere with the functional maturation of children's auditory brain, which processes auditory information. Emmanuel Lafont/BBC Traffic noise can negatively impact children's cognitive function during the crucial stages of brain development (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC) A 2019 study from Birkbeck University in London, which analysed the impact of noise in classrooms, found that children between 5-11 years of age are especially vulnerable to noise if they have lower selective attention – meaning, the ability to maintain focus and block out unwanted distraction – and inhibitory control, which is the ability to control urges and think before reacting. When there is a lot of noise around children, they do worse academically – Natasha Kirkham \"If a child has poor working memory and if their selective attention or their inhibitory control is not great, then they are going to be much more distracted by the noise around them,\" says Natasha Kirkham, co-author of the study and a professor in developmental psychology at Birkbeck University in London. \"When there is a lot of noise around children in primary and secondary school, we know they do worse [academically],\" she says. Noise pollution is often worse in poorer areas. A 2023 study found that children attending schools in Texas with the highest exposure to road noise were significantly more likely to be black, Hispanic and eligible for free or reduced lunches. Exposure to noise together with other factors that come from attending \"a lower-resourced school in a lower-resourced area, can have a real knock-on effect to learning,\" says Kirkham. The association between noise and stress may have lifelong consequences, research suggests. \"If you constantly feel aroused by sound, this could increase the cortisol response related to stress, and over time can have detrimental effects on physical and emotional health from childhood into adulthood,\" says Iroise Dumontheill, professor of cognitive neuroscience at Birkbeck University in London. Noise exposure in childhood could affect memory and health in adulthood - Iroise Dumontheill Continuous exposure to noise in the long term can interfere with the central nervous system and brain, increasing the likelihood of developing heart disease, stroke, dementia, and cognitive decline. \"So, potentially, noise exposure in childhood could affect the memory systems and mental health in adulthood,\" says Dumontheill. Car-free zones The best way to protect children from excessive noise is by reducing traffic around schools, says Foraster. Better urban design, such as separating schools from busy roads and adding parks and green spaces around school areas could also improve the learning environment for children, she says. Emmanuel Lafont/BBC Barcelona has introduced car-free neighbourhoods to protect children from noise pollution (Credit: Emmanuel Lafont/BBC) Barcelona is trying to do this by placing schools into so-called \"superilles\", or \"superblocks\", which are small neighbourhoods closed to through traffic and packed with green spaces where people can exercise or get together. First introduced in 1993, this urban design concept aims to reduce air and noise pollution, by prioritising cyclists and pedestrians over cars and playgrounds and trees over parking spots. (Read more about Barcelona's car-free smart city experiment.) The superblocks have been shown to reduce noise and air pollution in residential neighbourhoods in Barcelona. The creation of the San Antoni superblock has lowered average daytime noise levels by 3.5 decibels, a 5.2% reduction, according to data gathered over one year by sensors and sonometers and compiled in a 2021 report. It has also helped reduce air pollution. Reducing traffic around schools it seen as the best way to protect children from noise pollution \"Superblocks definitely help reduce air pollution and exposure to noise,\" says Foraster. \"They help reduce overall traffic by making the use of cars less attractive and promoting a more walkable city.\" Barcelona plans to create 503 superblocks by 2030 as part of its urban mobility plan, which aims to convert one in three streets into traffic-calmed green spaces, and ensure that 80% of all journeys in the city avoid cars and happen on foot, by public transport or by bike. Cities around the world are following Barcelona's example by implementing superblocks, including Buenos Aires, Vienna, Los Angeles and Bogota. Quieter schools and neighbourhoods could potentially have another benefit: happier children. Kirkham points out that noise not only affects how children learn – it may also affect how they feel. A home-schooling study carried out by Kirkham during the Covid-19 pandemic, found that adolescents from noisier homes, who spent time in noisier classrooms, generally found noise more annoying. \"It’s not just that noise is distracting, there is an emotional component. Children get irritated,\" she says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Fortunately (and by choice) I live in a relatively low traffic area, so at least at night it's got almost no traffic, but during the day it's got enough of it to force me to shut close the thermopane windows and doors AND turn on an electric fan heater without the heat, so the low frequency white noise it makes masks the occasional roaring of the car engine passing by. Also it's not like all the cars, most cars pass by with their engine on idle so they make little noise. Every now and then (which by law of statistics translates to always, eventually after some time), some idiot accelerates aggressively when their clutch is disengaged, resulting in the engine squealing like a demented stuck pig and me almost getting a seizure out of stress. And then there's the occasional SUV with tank tracks instead of tires (figuratively speaking, they have tires suitable for climbing muddy hills, not cruising through residential areas) which zooms around at 80Km/h, in this case can't hear the engine because the darn tracks make so much noise you can hear them from several blocks away. Hate. Cars. Also an unpopular opinion which will 100% guarantee I get fiercely downvoted: \"they\" should make gas prices not 10-20% but 4x - 8x higher.

Step 2: Enforce a yearly or bi-yearly tech inspection that checks the pollution / noise against the standard the car was made for (so old cars can still run on older pollution standards) There, problem solved. Seems like government over-reach? Well, that's how it is in several developed countries in Europe. That doesn't stop 100% of people from modifying their cars, but it'll quickly become very very niche, because consequences for doing that are too high for most enthusiasts. The main consequence are (1) if police checks and the pollution / noise reduction features are not there, you can be ordered to get your car back to stock in quick order, or in the worst case the car will be destroyed, and (2) in case of a crash, your insurance drops you because your car is not road-legal.

Gathering the political will otoh… reply stctw 13 hours agorootparentprevI am with you 100%. Imagine, if you would, that you lived in an apartment, and that you spent $2,000 on a stereo system, and that you turned up the volume so high that people in vehicles, driving by on the nearby street, could feel the sound waves inside their vehicles from a quarter-mile away. What would happen if you did that? Well, obviously, someone would call the police, and they would bang on your door, and they would warn or cite you, and you'd have to pay a fine or appear in court. On top of that, you'd probably get an angry call from your landlord, and if you ever did it again, you'd probably be evicted. It would be absurdly anti-social behavior that's prohibited by existing laws and ordinances. But, somehow, as you said, society tolerates the very same behavior when the source is inside a vehicle rolling around on wheels. And yet, if you think about it, as that vehicles rolls from one end of town to another, down busy streets, past residences and businesses and hospitals, the number of people needlessly antagonized and harmed by the noise must number in the thousands each day. \"But it's only for a few seconds,\" the other side will say. And yet it happens over, and over, and over again, tens of times a day, day after day, waking people up too early in the morning, disturbing them while they live and work at home, and keeping them up at night. And the purpose of this noise? Is it a necessary by-product of the vehicle's natural purpose? Of course not. The purpose is solely, completely, 100%, and only, self-aggrandizement of the operator; to intentionally antagonize innocent strangers who can't even be seen by the antagonist. If anyone doubts this, one should look at a few advertisements offering these audio systems for sale. \"DISTURB YOUR NEIGHBORS\" is a common theme, even an explicit one. The noise is entirely artificial, with no reasonable, ethical, or moral purpose. To derive pleasure from the mere intuition that someone, somewhere is being antagonized by one's own actions is surely a sociopathic, anti-social, anti-societal behavior. We hear the cries to legalize some drugs because \"they don't harm anyone but the user,\" but where are the cries to de-legalize this widely harmful behavior? Well, FWIW, I've been told by local cops that the behavior is already illegal in my area, but when they've cited offenders, their cases have been dismissed by local judges, so now they don't bother. Why? Who knows, but when I consider the local businesses that sell these stereo systems, I can only imagine their reaction to a campaign to \"lower the boom\" by ticketing offenders, and I wonder what influence they may have on local government. Put that together with increased violence in general, and the increased risk of a confrontation at any traffic stop, and I can imagine that cops consider carefully whether to initiate one for various behaviors. And we hear these cries to make people live closer together, in smaller dwellings. No, I want to be further apart, with more buffer. I am very careful not to impose my by-products on my neighbors, but not all of them are so considerate. /rant (I so rarely see like-minded people talking about this issue) reply t-writescode 22 hours agoprevTwo of the best parts, to me, about electric cars are: 1) lower pollution where people live, so you can go for runs and such without breathing in a bunch of noxious gas 2) how much quieter inner city walking will become.

The last 30 years or so have been amazing for cutting down engine noise levels. In trying to squeeze out ever last drop of efficiency they have also reduced the noise levels. Nowadays the only times I really notice them is either when idling or something from before the 90's is driving past. reply ChainOfFools 18 hours agorootparentThis is the point that makes all of the miserable noise pollution from modified cars so much more grating, knowing that whatever is making excess noise means potentially useful (in a performance sense) power is escaping as sound somewhere in their drivetrain, so insofar as their objective is to make their vehicles loud for the sake of loud, these people are achieving the opposite of what they're trying to signal they're achieving. reply d3ad1ysp0rk 18 hours agorootparentEfficiency and power are not equivalent.

Cars are loud and that's a problem by itself, but a car with a bad driver is exponentially worse than one with a normal driver. reply noahtallen 21 hours agorootparentThat’s one part, but the other massive part is noise from freeways and the baseline white noise from faster roads, where most of the noise comes from tires. EVs are not better (and typically worse since they’re heavier) — the only way to fix it is 1. No freeways in city centers. 2. Fewer cars. 3. Noise barriers. 4. Asphalt that reduces tire noise (uncommon in North American cities, where concrete is used to improve the lifespan). I can’t use my balcony in a downtown city center because the baseline tire noise from the highway is so loud, and that’s without the obnoxious exhaust reply maskros 20 hours agoparentprevThen you haven't heard electric cars running at low speed or put in reverse.

Really it is just about showing you have a six figure salary and nothing to do with being kind to the planet. My new phrase is 'active travel' and this means walking, cycling or using a wheelchair. The opposite of 'active travel' is car dependency. For the car dependent person, walking is something you do after driving to the car park in the beauty spot, to get the boots out the back of the car and do 'hiking' as a leisure exercise, to not actually do anything of purpose. Cycling is the same, a bicycle is just a toy for leisure, with a piece of polystyrene having to be worn on the head. In the world of 'active travel' the walk is to the shops or to see a friend. It is the same with cycling, rather than pointlessly ride on a 'toy', it is a trip to work or the shops, a journey of purpose. With 'active travel' there is community. You meet people old and new on the journeys you take and you can stop and talk. Car dependent people can honk their horns and wave, but that is quite primitive communication compared to saying hello. Just today I met someone on the canal towpath that is cycling coast to coast, having met him a couple of days ago too. It was great to see him again, and that was just one interaction on my journey. I had to get somewhere so I did not stop to talk for too long, but you just don't have those sorts of interactions if trapped in a tin box, electric or otherwise. Yes there might be cup holders, air conditioning and massaging heated seats, but I prefer the community aspect of 'active travel'. When people go car dependent they take themselves out of being part of the community. A huge part of this is noise levels. Sometimes I use turn by turn directions on my phone, and, if I am on towpaths, the volume of 'after 200 yards, turn right' is embarrassingly loud. Yet, if I have the same volume and I am on a normal road, I make wrong turns because the noise of cars, even at a low speed on quiet roads, is too loud for me to hear the turn by turn directions. Only if spending hours on canal towpaths and former railway tracks turned into cycle paths so you realise how absurd the noise of car dependency is. Another phrase is 'livable neighbourhoods' and the idea is to put active travel first so there is a return to community and health. Sadly, electric cars are a folly. I don't hate on them, I have just discovered 'active travel'. Incidentally, 'active travel' depends on health, and that means either being young or eating for nutrition. You can't walk your way out of a bad diet, or cycle out of it. There is a whole lot we need to work out and electric cars, sadly, are not it, not even for people that live in the countryside, have a dozen kids and a job a hundred miles away. reply itsoktocry 18 hours agorootparentThe fact that you feel like you can't have human interaction or community unless you're walking somewhere sounds like a skill issue on your part.

This article you linked states that tires emit not only more particulate emissions than tailpipes during driving, but also more VOC emissions! > Another area of research centers on the impacts of aromatic hydrocarbons — including benzene and naphthalene — off-gassed by synthetic rubber or emitted when discarded tires are burned in incinerators for energy recovery. Even at low concentrations, these compounds are toxic to humans. They also react with sunlight to form ozone, or ground-level smog, which causes respiratory harm. “We have shown that the amount of off-gassing volatile organic compounds is 100 times greater than that coming out of a modern tailpipe,” said Molden. “This is from the tire just sitting there.” reply ChainOfFools 14 hours agorootparentI'm starting to see more and more homes in the area where I live, Southern California in the LA region, switching from green unsustainable lawns to some form of hardscape/ xeriscaping. one of the rising trends is the use of old tires as a ground cover source. These have been shredded and processed with a small amount of coloring into something that very strikingly resembles and spreads like wood chips until you pick them up and feel them in your hands. Of course it better solution would be to not have tires that are so toxic to begin with, but there are very few products into which the most unusable kinds of recyclable plastic streams can be fed, and tires are one of them. reply ipqk 18 hours agorootparentprevCertainly most particulate matter, and it's not even close. Comparing particulates to gas emissions is difficult, so there's no way to say what's \"most\". Either way, my greater point still stands: switching to EVs isn't a cure-all to breathing around cars. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentSure, I suppose this is where I find umbrage with the claim. Instead of “most” maybe try “a comparable quantity of”? (I’d cut to the chase by clarifying tyres and brakes are the principle source of particulate matter, a pollutant with proven harms.) reply phatfish 20 hours agorootparentprevThe parent was worried about \"noxious gas\", not rubber particles. Cars with an ICE have tires as well, unfortunately. reply ipqk 19 hours agorootparentTires are only about 25% natural rubber; the rest is synthetic rubber, heavy metals, plastics, and additives. These get emitted as fine particulates that stick around in the air. They may not technically be a gas, but we breathe it in just the same. reply jiggawatts 18 hours agorootparentI very much doubt that heavy metals such as mercury or lead are used to make tyres. I've only ever heard of steel belted tyres. It used to be that wheels were balanced with small lead weights, but the use of lead for this has been banned in pretty much every western country, and wasn't contributing to road dust even when they were allowed. reply ipqk 18 hours agorootparent\"Hundreds of other ingredients, including steel, fillers, and heavy metals — including copper, cadmium, lead, and zinc — make up the rest, many of them added to enhance performance, improve durability, and reduce the possibility of fires.\" https://e360.yale.edu/features/tire-pollution-toxic-chemical... reply jiggawatts 17 hours agorootparentThey didn't reference a source, and the claim is rather outlandish. Cadmium and Lead are both quite toxic, and I'd be absolutely shocked if any tyre company in the western world used either of them anywhere near their products, let alone mixed into the rubber, which is insane. \"Tire fragments soaked in solutions with pH ranging from 3 to 8 did not leach measurable amounts of cadmium over a period of six week\" from: https://www.echocommunity.org/en/resources/b1d9d1eb-afcb-472... \"Cadmium and lead concentrations were negligible.\" from: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9085433/ \"The low cadmium levels in their tyres was due to the efficacy of the zinc oxide purification process.

So... it looks like tyres contain some Zinc, which many decades ago wasn't purified very well, which resulted in Cadmium and Lead being included as impurities in the Zinc. The industrial processes have improved and this is no longer a problem, but people are quoting tyre compound issues from the 1950s like they're still issues today. Whoever wrote the article you linked couldn't be bothered to run a quick Google search to see if the problem still exists. That's unfathomably lazy.

In fact the whole article comes off like a bad internet argument, tons of links that aren't understood, and the whole thing is designed to reach a pretermined conclusion, which is, of course: \"Car-free zones The best way to protect children from excessive noise is by reducing traffic around schools, says Foraster. \" I mean.

Now I realize there may be corner cases and so on, but in general this would work wonders and so far I see 0 being done there. The thing is, certain cars and many motorbikes simply can't be quiet regardless of rpms, even in 30kmh they wake many people up through closed window. As somebody who lived just next to very busy street for few years, there are 2, or maybe 3 main noise pollutants in the order of intensity: 1) ambulances & police, they are really properly mental level and they don't care even on completely empty 3am streets, if I don't cover my ears when they pass me it physically hurts, even with my subpar hearing of higher frequencies; 2) motorbikes like choppers by default, and all tuned rest, aka Akrapovic and similar mods should be banned in inner cities, permanently, 24/7. And 3) sports cars obviously, but they posed the least problem even in uber rich place like Geneva where seeing a Ferrari or McLaren is not unusual, and nobody looks at Porsche or below.

Think of every parking lots needed for people to park their car, motor accident, tire, noise, CO2 pollution, materials needed for repaving and repairing road damage, etc. Soundproofing sounds cheaper, but it's just another additional cost imposed by cars.

That bit really ought to be on by default, come to think of it. I think about this quote when reading articles like this (to say nothing of the research it draws on): > The best way to identify sketchy scientific claims is by their level of abstraction.... if a new paper claims that attractive people are more (or less) generous than ugly people, I would be highly suspicious. “Generosity” is a very abstract and nebulous quality, and I would want to know how it was measured...The profound abstractions of everyday life—happiness, relationships, sleep, nutrition, motivation, pain, belonging—are the concepts most vulnerable to scientific abuse. (https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-trust-undermines-scienc...) The phrase \"hurts children's brains\" seems almost ludicrously abstract to me, so it's a little suspicious from the get go. Then I get to their examples. The example of a train track literally running next to a classroom is one thing—I can see that being a problem—but it's a bit different than being next to a city street, which is where the article immediately pivots. Is the average classroom so loud that people physically cannot concentrate? Quoting studies that say that loud classrooms affect student performance doesn't demonstrate that most classrooms are too loud to concentrate, and that anything needs to be done about it. And even if classrooms in Barcelona are all too loud to concentrate, that says nothing about classrooms anywhere else—not even anywhere else in Spain, let alone the entire world. Blegh. reply kiba 20 hours agorootparentNoise pollution affecting children(or adults) in negatives ways is not an exactly an original claim that the paper make nor is it the first one to say so.

Nobody's doubting that dropping a kettlebell on your foot would be bad, the question is whether slippery kettlebells are a plague that's ruining today's gyms or not.

The speed changes while driving on it, not compared to what it was months or years ago. And then, yes, not using the design to signal the speed changes.

    "originBody": "Software Operating Systems Windows Microsoft Account to local account conversion guide erased from official Windows 11 guide — instructions redacted earlier this week News By Jowi Morales published 23 June 2024 Microsoft really, really wants you to use a Microsoft Account with your Windows 11 PC. Comments (10) (Image credit: Microsoft) Microsoft has been pushing hard for its users to sign into Windows with a Microsoft Account. The newest Windows 11 installer removed the easy bypass to the requirement that you make an account or login with your existing account. If you didn't install Windows 11 without a Microsoft Account and now want to stop sending the company your data, you can still switch to a local account after the fact. Microsoft even had instructions on how to do this on its official support website - or at least it used to... Microsoft's 'Change from a local account to a Microsoft Account' guide shows users how they can change their Windows 11 PC login credentials to use their Microsoft Account. The company also supplied instructions on how to 'Change from a Microsoft account to a local account' on the same page. However, when we checked the page using the Wayback Machine, the instructions on how to do the latter appeared on June 12, 2024, then disappeared on June 17, 2024. The 'Change from a Microsoft account to a local account' instructions yet haven't returned. Converting your Windows 11 PC's login from a Microsoft Account to a local account is a pretty simple process. All you have to do is go to the Settings app, proceed to Accounts > Your info, and select \"Sign in with a local account instead.\" Follow the instructions on the screen, and you should be good to go. When Microsoft had these instructions on its support page, it sandwiched them between warnings saying, \"Using a Microsoft account in Windows allows for seamless integration of Microsoft services, enhanced security, and sync across devices, unlike a local account,\" and \"when using a local account, it's a good idea to create a password reset disk. If you don't do this and then forget your password, you won't be able to recover it.\" It's apparent that Microsoft really wants users to sign up and use their services, much like how Google and Apple make you create an account so you can make full use of your Android or iDevice. While Windows 11 still lets you use the OS with a local account, these developments show that Microsoft wants this option to be inaccessible, at least for the average consumer.

You shouldn't be sticking with Windows if that is really how you feel. It's their operating system, they own it,(They also happen to be the owner of their own website) and there's no reason for it to be illegal for them to treat what they own as they see fit. Linux numbers are still rising, sadly though they aren't rising fast enough for this type of chicanery from Microsoft. Microsoft abuses its customers because its customers have proven to be willing to accept the abuse. To be fair, this small change is only a website change. But it clearly indicates that more battering is going to take place against Windows users. Everybody can cry all they want, Microsoft is not done clobbering.

Reply ekio This OS packed with the worst blend of obsolete crap code, deepest lack of perfectionism and terrible unchanged technical design from the early 80s… and now that. Ok that’s dead. Reply 35below0 Albert.Thomas said: ...and what if, theoretically, Microsoft were to ban your account in error? In such a scenario, you could lose access to your own files because you can't sign in to your own computer. Microsoft don't ban accounts. They don't even bother to enforce anti-piracy measures for Win 11, why would they ban your account? If you had a ban, you'd probably be unable to access their forum and parts of their help system or error reporting. But even denying you customer service would be against the law. Your PC and the OS you installed is functional regardless of how you use (or don't use) the MS account. It doesn't even do anything if you decline all the offers. It certainly could do things, like sync across multiple devices but that's kinda useful. Of course, there is every chance your usage statistics or data would be harvested. I too wish Microsoft would bugger off with user accounts on HOME PCs that have a single user anyway. I'm not in a library, i don't need personal folders and i'm not interested in their ecosystem nor do i want Win 11 to connect to my phone, but they are deaf to all that. And i do understand that they will not design a separate OS just for use cases like this. They design a behemoth, \"one size fits all\" system, and that's how it goes. I don't really get why 11 gets this much hate since it's actually a good OS with some facepalm flaws, but that's Windows... For anyone wishing to force Microsoft to not harvest or send telemetry, try Windows 10 Firewall Control from sphinx-soft (works on 11 too despite the name), or simplewall (open source). It's not simple to define all the inbound and outbound rules, but you can certainly deny traffic over your connection unless you know what it is and actually want it. System connections require a paid version of WFirewallControl, but it's not expensive. In addition to targetting Microsoft, such firewall tools will also allow you to keep potential malware out of your hair, block applications from phoning home or force block updates (with limits though). Reply umeng2002_2 Microsoft is a bigger joke of company now than they ever were in the past. Reply techfreak I just hope Microsoft realize that if down the road, somehow Windows 11 cannot install using local account. How are users able to install drivers especially for newer hardware like LAN or WIFI? This is where local account comes in, at least you can install the Chipset etc. drivers first. Connect to the internet for Windows update and let Windows patch whatever it needed. I just feel it's a dumb move to emphasis MS online account during installation especially when drivers for that PC are not installed properly. Reply VIEW ALL 10 COMMENTS Show more comments",

    "commentBody": "Microsoft Account to local account conversion guide erased from Windows 11 guide (tomshardware.com)161 points by belter 6 hours agohidepastfavorite235 comments nerdjon 5 hours agoI would encourage anyone who is comfortable with reinstalling Windows (or knows someone, I am about to do this to my partners PC) to go with the LTSC version of Windows. 11 LTSC is even out now if you want the most compatible version for gaming (I have seen some arguments that there are features in 11 that make games run better but I have yet to be able to really confirm this). Gives all of the advantages on compatibility (particularly for gaming, I even installed LTSC on my Steam Deck) with having a seriously stripped down version of Windows. Microsoft is very careful to make it seem like LTSC is so stripped down that it really only works for kiosks or similar devices, but it is perfectly capable as a general computing device. It is possible to install things that it is missing fairly easily, like if you need the Microsoft store (windows store? don't remember the name) to use the Xbox app it will prompt you to install the missing components. Edit: Since I got a couple comments about the license. I should have included that here. There is a github project for activation. Since it is perfectly viable but removes a lot of the crap that Microsoft wants to push of course they don't make it easy to get. But personally if I already have a legal copy of Windows 11 I have no moral problems with using this script to activate LTSC Version. Getting the ISO is easy with Microsoft providing them free to download. Edit again: Instead of replying to every comment regarding to just switch to linux I will edit my post here explaining why I have not. First off, is for me Windows is primarily for gaming. So compatibility and performance are my number one priority. Proton is great but you can't beat the compatibility of just using Windows. Never need to worry about an update breaking something or a game not working. It just does. In at least a few cases performance is even better on the LTSC version compared to SteamOS on my Steam Deck. I also don't want to be restricted to just using Steam for games or needing to jump through additional hoops to play from other stores. I play video games to relax, that isn't a time that I want to be tinkering or messing with my computer if something goes wrong. reply makeitdouble 5 hours agoparentDidn't know what LTSC was about, so for people in the same boat: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/iot-enterprise... The main issue I'd see is licensing. It seems to be a completely different bucket, so would it activate with a Home or Pro license ? (OEM or not) reply nerdjon 5 hours agorootparentI should have mentioned that, yeah Licensing is the key problem here but there is a github script that fixes this if you don't have any ethical issues with that. But personally if I already have a legal copy of Win11 I have no moral problems with reinstalling LTSC and using a script to activate it. reply makeitdouble 4 hours agorootparentThanks for the pointer. The more I think of it, the more licensing looks like the best representation of Microsoft's strategy for Windows. Stable, lean and long term focused versions are locked under the most hidden of the enterprise licenses. Decent versions without the garbage ads and spyware features only ship to enterprise. \"Pro\" users are only blessed with virtualization and a few candies, and share the worse edition with \"Home\" users. It makes a lot more sense why the enterprise machines are near 30% more expensive than their customer counterpart. reply nerdjon 4 hours agorootparentIt is interesting because a lot of people criticize Apple as basically you are paying for privacy. And that is very true, they have turned it into a marketing feature. But Microsoft is very brazen about it when it comes to Windows. The more you pay the less privacy invasive crap there is. I don't know for sure what the difference between home and pro is for analytics sent back to Microsoft, but LTSC is a drastic difference. (annoyingly still not zero though) reply npteljes 3 hours agorootparentprevThere is no github script that fixes this, there are scripts that redirect the activation mechanism to pirate activation servers that validate every incoming request. Not knowing this mechanism beforehand, I was very surprised by this, because this is what even many activator software do as well. I consider it a major breach of trust from the authors. Maybe there can be an exploit that uses the activation mechanism as a vector, and then, many of such machines will be compromised. This is a risk, and it's something that a user needs to evaluate before going into it. I personally solve this for myself by running the activation server emulator myself. It's open source software and really easy to set up as well. https://github.com/Wind4/vlmcsd reply chronogram 1 hour agorootparentThis is untrue. The script being referred to by the original comment activates your IoT LTSC as perfectly genuine at Microsoft's own server, no third party comes into play. https://massgrave.dev/ reply GreenVulpine 4 hours agorootparentprevIt is always ethical to pirate Microsoft software. The unethical thing is giving them more money for this slop. reply fuzzy2 5 hours agoparentprevAnd how do you propose Regular Joe procure a license? Not trying to be snide, but LTSC is an enterprise product that is only available with volume licensing. So unless you want to pirate it… reply toast0 3 hours agorootparentYou can get LTSC through microsoft resellers. Last I heard, you have to buy at least 5 licenses to be in Volume Licensing, but if you only have one computer, you can buy one LTSC license ($270-$300) and then 4 low cost filler licenses (I think seats for something were $10-$30 each?) And the LTSC license is an upgrade license, so the computer needs licensing for Windows already (maybe needs Pro and not Home, too). But it ends up being a large amount of money to run wierd windows. reply JeremyNT 3 hours agorootparentprev\"This one weird trick makes Windows not suck\" - except that the weird trick is... piracy! I get that people really like Windows, but all these contortions just to delay the inevitable... yeesh. At some point, people either need to get onboard with the MS vision for the product, or accept that it's time to switch to something different. reply GreenVulpine 4 hours agorootparentprevNo need for a license. Just activate it with one of the many activation scripts around. reply Zhyl 4 hours agorootparentSo pirate it reply michaelt 4 hours agorootparentSome would say, if you already have a legal, paid-for license to run Windows on a given PC, and you merely want a slightly different version which is older and doesn't add any extra features, that's a lesser form of piracy. reply Novosell 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's using a legit copy of windows and performing a legit activation, no exploits or anything. To call it piracy is the same as me telling you my pin and calling you a hacker when you login to my account, no? Microsoft could fix it, but they don't. reply sakjur 3 hours agorootparent> To call it piracy is the same as me telling you my pin and calling you a hacker when you login to my account, no? Somewhat absurd linguistically and morally ambiguous, yet possibly legally accurate? reply toast0 4 hours agorootparentprevWas it piracy to install windows 95 on 100 computers with one cd and one product id and no outside licensing? Of course it was. Just because it lets you do it, doesn't mean it's not piracy. reply Novosell 45 minutes agorootparentWell, that activation was entirely offline, wasn't it? With the tech at the time, would it really be possible to stop multiple activations? Windows 11 now requires you to log in using email and that you have internet, so they could easily pull the plug on the MAS scripts. Yet they don't. reply ToucanLoucan 4 hours agorootparentprevI genuinely wonder why they haven't. Those activation githubs have been around for what feels like forever at this point, and you just activate copies of Windows acquired from Microsoft for free, and they just... don't seem to care? reply 0xcde4c3db 3 hours agorootparentI have no direct knowledge, but my best guess is that they have significant legit customers using these as an alternative to Microsoft's own Key Management Services. Historically, some stuff like this has even turned out to be used by the company themselves (e.g. a few Steam/GOG releases have been found to use old warez scene cracks, official arcade emulators using bootleg sets from MAME, etc.). reply wing-_-nuts 3 hours agoparentprevSerious question, why not just switch to linux? I installed W11 after building gaming / workstation this year, and I've grudgingly left it in place because I don't want 'anti-cheat' hassles that you sometimes run into playing games with steam / proton. If WSL wasn't a thing I would have formatted it by now. Linux is just such a better experience for development. I also simply cannot shake the fear that windows is leaking every keystroke back to some MS service I haven't disabled. reply Paradigma11 59 minutes agorootparentFor me it is because I dont care about most negatives that are usually brought up. I need my os to get out of the way and be robust and W11 does that way better than Linux for me. I do have an Ubuntu Laptop and occasionally also try Linux in a VM or dual installation on my main desktop but it is always far more hassle than windows. reply multimoon 1 hour agorootparentprevGaming. Even while Proton is incredible - the experience with nvidia GPUs is still less than stellar. So if you want high resolution/framerate gaming - especially if you add HDR to that - you’re still stuck with windows. I’d love to switch to Linux if I could, I use it or MacOS for everything else. reply nerdjon 3 hours agorootparentprevFor me my windows setups are dedicated gaming devices, nothing more. Any general computing I do (with some random exceptions due to convenience) is on my Mac. So for me the number one priority is performance and compatibility. Which as far as proton has come, using the LTSC version on Windows easily wins on compatibility (especially once you leave Steam) and in some cases wins on performance. LTSC also drastically reduces the metrics sent back to Microsoft. reply metadat 2 hours agorootparentmacOS does offer a nicer overall UX than Windows, but the amount of telemetry Apple machines constantly stream to home base is disturbing. And unlike windows, I don't know of a way to turn it off. If you run Wireshark on any Mac you will observe the high volume of requests to Apple-owned IPs. Even when the machine is otherwise idle. It's creepy. On the other hand, Linux machines don't default to sending telemetry. P.s. Ubuntu is an exception to this rule which is one reason I'll never use Ubuntu again (they've included telemetry and embedded ads in the past). Debian and Pop_os both work remarkably well for desktop use these days. reply npteljes 3 hours agorootparentprevFor me, online multiplayer gaming. So now I have my Linux daily driver, and a gaming OS basically dual-booted. reply wing-_-nuts 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I ostensibly haven't switched back so I don't have to deal with anti-cheat issues, but if I'm really honest with myself I don't game nearly as much as I used to and when I do it's usually single player. reply npteljes 1 hour agorootparentYes but I understand that you might not want to cut off the possibility. I personally dual-boot, but for similar convenience reasons I have some of the games installed on both systems. Even dual-booting is a bit of a pain, some of which I have solved by having a dedicated SSD for each OS. Windows sometimes misbehaves and it's easier to handle that if it has its own drive. reply Berazu 1 hour agoparentprevThe new Forza game was not supported by the previous LTSC version for a long time so I wouldn’t say that it’s the most compatible version for gaming. reply nerdjon 1 hour agorootparentWhich Forza and which LTSC version? I have not had issues with Horizon 5 or the new Forza on my steam deck under Windows 10 LTSC 2021. I believe I played both at or near launch. That is the first I have heard of a game not working on LTSC. Edit: My timeline is off, I did not try Horizon 5 on my steam deck until about a year after it came out since Horizon 5 predated the steam deck. However worth pointing out that it is one example of a game not working on LTSC vs many examples on proton so I would argue it still Wins out on compatibility. reply philistine 2 hours agoparentprevThat’s ultimately just playing the cat-and-mouse game with Microsoft. If LTSC becomes a commonly used trick to get local accounts, Microsoft will put even more barriers to get through. It’s not a game I’d want anyone to play. reply nerdjon 49 minutes agorootparentI honestly would not be too worried about that happening. LTSC is likely a small but critical part to Microsoft keeping Windows in control, being able to continue to deploy Windows in places that may have otherwise moved to Linux. Once an organization starts down that path than it opens the doors for other non windows systems. It also can't have too many restrictions put on how it runs and is activated or its value plummets. The fact is the vast majority of users won't go down this path, it will always be the power users or those with power users to manage their computers. But frankly, even if a significant portion (like say 10%) were to start using LTSC version. That still keeps Windows in a dominate position as far as the market and developer support goes. Which is a win for Microsoft. reply treprinum 4 hours agoparentprevWouldn't W10 be better? No online account needed and there is still Windows Mixed Reality many VR games rely on. reply DanHulton 4 hours agorootparentI'm on W10 for now for largely this reason, but it's not future-proof. Support ends on Oct 10, 2025, and they'll almost certainly stop supporting it with some gaming-critical libraries and functionalities sooner than that. When that happens, I'm going to do my damnedest to transition to Linux. I can already play the vast majority of games really well on my Steam Deck, so ideally I can recreate the same technology stack on my desktop and just have better hardware there. reply abhinavk 3 hours agorootparentBazzite, Chimera and Nobara are trying to do the same thing on top of different mainstream distros if you don't want to do it yourself. For better hardware Nvidia Graphics issues are largely fixed with the new beta driver so by that time, it should be a good place. reply ziddoap 4 hours agorootparentprevYou don't need an online account for W11 either. reply nerdjon 3 hours agorootparentprevAs someone else said, in Windows 11 LTSC you do not need an online account to set it up. reply lawlessone 3 hours agoparentprevI just switched to Linux for gaming. So far most things have worked quite well FO4 and Horizon Dawn seem to have identical performance to windows. Simcity 4 has issues. But i has issues on new PC's too. reply zrobotics 3 hours agorootparentModded or vanilla FO4? I'm curious if modded works at all and how much of an additional hassle is it compared to windows (which, depending on how much you are adding, can be quite a bit of work anyway). reply lawlessone 2 hours agorootparentCurrent Steam vanilla version. GOG games seem to be harder to get working. There are some default mods bethesda recently gave away and some DLC i bought that haven't caused on issues. No idea about third party stuff Another indie game \"Intergalactic fishing\" doesn't run for me in windows, but does run on WINE .. which is hilarious. reply wkat4242 3 hours agoparentprevLTSC 24h2 is technically supposed to be out but it's still not available on msdn sadly. reply Zhyl 5 hours agoparentprevAre there trade-offs with this? reply hurutparittya 5 hours agorootparentThe main trade-off is that you don't get to enjoy the benefits of upgrading to Linux instead :^) reply nerdjon 5 hours agorootparentprevI have yet to have any issues with it and I switched full time to LTSC on multiple devices for about 2 years now, the only minor trade off is if something you rely on is not installed automatically like the Microsoft store. So when you first launch the Xbox app it will tell you that there are things that need to be installed, but it gives a button to do exactly that. You also don't get new features that Microsoft roles out, but I don't consider that a trade off and is instead a positive. Bonus I was able to un-install copilot completely from control panel on Windows 11 LTSC. reply digging 4 hours agoparentprev> I even installed LTSC on my Steam Deck For what purpose? reply nerdjon 4 hours agorootparentFull compatibility with games, I never need to think or worry about wether or not an update will break compatibility with Proton. Something that had happened a couple times with Halo Infinite and others. Not needing to worry about getting on the bad side of a developer like with Destiny 2. Easily use stores that are not just Steam to hopefully discourage a monopoly that is currently largely on PC gaming. If I want to run things like Discord, OBS, or whatever other thing I want running I don't have to jump through hoops. Finally the ability to use Game Pass games natively. Windows has become my primary driver on my Steam Deck. Does what I need it to do, play games. Some games even run better under 10LTSC compared to SteamOS. reply SSLy 3 hours agorootparentprevsome games want kernel level rootkits (\"anticheat\"), some just block their DRM in proton, and if you want to use game pass PC, well, you need MS store. reply reportgunner 5 hours agoparentprevWhy not just use Win10 LTSC ? reply kelsey98765431 4 hours agorootparentThe amount of people doing this was so vast that windows 10 ltsc stopped receiving updates when windows 11 was first announced and by happy coincidence is just ever so slightly too old now for the benefits versus just using linux with proton on steam. reply nerdjon 4 hours agorootparentI do not believe this is true. Windows 10 LTSC will continue to get security improvements at least until next year depending on the LTSC version you have installed and up to 2032. As far as it not getting a new cut version after the 2021 one, I feel like that is just normal practice? Does Microsoft normally cut a new version of their LTSC version on an older OS when they are working on the next version? Was there even a need for a new 10 LTSC after 2021? reply nerdjon 4 hours agorootparentprevI think 10LTSC is perfectly viable right now, I still run 10LTSC on my Steam Deck. Right now on my desktop I have 10 LTSC, 11 LTSC, and 11 Pro installed and doing a bunch of benchmarks but still early on data (trying to be as thorough as possible). I have had someone try to tell me that there is something in Windows 11 that makes it run better on newer processors, I have not been able to find any information on this. Also theoretically at some point driver support or game support will diminish on 10. Personally, I think if you are going to go for a new installation 11 likely may be the way to go for the best future compatibility. But 10 is still good. reply arprocter 4 hours agorootparent>I have had someone try to tell me that there is something in Windows 11 that makes it run better on newer processors, I have not been able to find any information on this. Possibly they were referring to this: https://www.anandtech.com/show/16959/intel-innovation-alder-... reply nerdjon 4 hours agorootparentThat is it! I remember something about the scheduler. Will need to do some more research and benchmarks on this personally and see if it is really much of an improvement or if the improvements are lost by any decrease in performance going from 10 to 11 (even on LTSC). reply keyringlight 3 hours agorootparentprevThe other aspect in the background is win10 is putting up a full screen warning about hitting EOL in Oct'25 while not giving older (~pre-2018) systems an official route to upgrade to anything supported besides buying a whole new system. For those that are content with the performance for desktop the scheduler doesn't really offer them anything. I'd love to see some form of OS survey in 2026 narrowed down to pre-2018 systems still online. reply exsomet 44 minutes agoprevAround a year or so ago, I made a new rule for myself: Stop giving money and support to people and organizations that openly show disdain for me. It originally came from getting tired of watching (in this case, WoW) streamers talk about how stupid and out of touch “chat” (a group that includes me) is in one breath and then ask for support/subscriptions in the next, but I started applying it to the other things that I consume as well. In this case, here we have a very clear effort by lots of people to not be tracked, and Microsoft making concerted efforts to take away the thing they want for the purpose of making more money. It’s not feasible to be absolute in this - I still need to put gas in my car and eat, for example. But I find there’s a strangely good feeling to walking away from someone who’s making presumptions about their right to my time, attention, and money while spitting in my face, and I feel like I’m a normal enough person to be a reasonable barometer on that sentiment. So I guess my point is, I wonder how many times a company like Microsoft can spit in their customers faces before the average person decides to not be a customer anymore. reply eps 6 hours agoprevMicrosoft's end goal is \"Windows as a subscription service\".

It is not like this is some new thing behind a paywall suddenly. Sure, back in the day it was pretty common for an average home PC to come with at least some version of Microsoft Works, but technically that was an OEM-licensed basic productivity software suite, not actually free. In the end it was just that Dell, HP, Compaq, or whoever was paying for it to put it on the list of out of the box features. More Copilot features for $20 a month?

Would have done it myself if it was an easy screwdriver-only job rather than requiring heat and special tools.

With iPhones you can replace the battery for a small fraction of the cost of a new phone.

The iPhone one works by having you pay the monthly installment price for the phone forever. That’s usually in the $30-40/month range, which many people can stomach in exchange for guaranteed new phones every year. But Mac installment prices are $200+ a month. There just isn’t a market for a laptop subscription that costs as much as car insurance. reply nerdjon 5 hours agorootparentA Mac Upgrade program doesn't have to be the same upgrade cycle, same if they went the route of doing an iPad upgrade program. It would also help minimize the need to try to future proof your choice. I know when I go to buy a Mac I often way over spec since I am planning for at least 3 or 4 years. That conversation is completely different if I know I am getting an upgrade in 1 or 2 years. Meanwhile if the Mac Upgrade Program could be, idk a 2 year upgrade plan. Looking at the cheapest 16\" M3 Max MBP. Right now that is $291.58 month for 12 months. If a Mac Upgrade Plan did the same timeline as iPhone where you paid over 2 years but could upgrade after a year that would be about $147.28. But it could likely be a 3 or 4 year timeline and be even cheaper. If we look at the lower end it gets even cheaper with the cheapest 16\" MBP could be $104 a month. The cheapest 14\" MPB could be $66.5 a month. Keeps going cheaper if you look at the Air. I feel like at that price the market very much exists when the top iPhone is $74.91 a month.

MacOS is basically unusable without logging into an Apple account, your logic does not follow. This said, MacOS seems to be slowly but surely taking over former Windows use cases both in business and homes.

People use computers to get shit done, after all. reply HeckFeck 5 hours agorootparent> MacOS is basically unusable without logging into an Apple account It depends if you mean the OS + cloud services + app store, or just having an OS to run programs. The former definitely needs the Apple ID, but the latter doesn't. When I first switched back to macOS I refused any Apple ID linkage during OOBE and it never asked again. I just used Nextcloud, Firefox, LibreOffice and FOSS utilities, everything worked. Later I did connect it after researching Apple's privacy policies, encryption methods and on-device processing - afaik I'm getting the cloud goodness without Apple selling my data, and that was enough to sway me. reply the_snooze 5 hours agorootparentprev>MacOS is basically unusable without logging into an Apple account I use a Mac at my job with no Apple ID linked to it. What am I missing out on? It's not like you need to use the App Store to get software, so that's not it. reply Aaron2222 5 hours agorootparentprevmacOS is completely usable without an Apple ID. All you lose is iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime, iTunes/Apple Music/Apple TV, and the Mac App Store (but most apps are distributed outside of it anyway). And you can sign into the Mac App Store separately from iCloud as well. So not really comparable to Microsoft's push for signing in with a Microsoft account. reply eesmith 5 hours agorootparentprevI only used Apple Id once, to install the C compiler (\"Command Line Tools (CLT) for Xcode\", for Homebrew). Though that was 2 years ago - has it changed? reply Aaron2222 5 hours agorootparentApple ID shouldn't be required for that (unless you're downloading it from the Apple Developer site instead of installing through macOS directly?). reply eesmith 4 hours agorootparentMaybe I'm wrong? It's been a couple of years. I think I recall there were alternatives, but using my Apple ID was easiest? reply Aaron2222 4 hours agorootparentYou should just be prompted to install it whenever you try and run a command (like Git or Clang) that's installed by it. `xcode-select --install` triggers the installation as well. macOS just downloads and installs it through the same underlying mechanism that macOS updates are installed by, no account required. (Homebrew also just installs it automatically now, without needing any user intervention.) EDIT: Maybe you were put off by the insane time estimate that it presents for some reason? It quotes a multi-day installation time that ends up only taking a few minutes. Maybe Apple will fix that someday. reply LightHugger 5 hours agoparentprevDespite all the awfulness of windows, macos is just as user hostile if not moreso especially on the hardware layer, so i'm not really sure about that one.

Meanwhile Steam has to use Proton, and is nonetheless around 2%. reply Zhyl 5 hours agorootparentProton has massively changed the game. I'd say the time since 2018 has had more advances in usability than the 25 years before it (for \"normal\" people), effectively making any \"you've been saying this for X years\" argument moot. reply pjmlp 5 hours agorootparentProton is Windows PC gaming with a Linux kernel. It is only a moot point for those \"I feel good to use Linux kernel to run Windows on top\" kind of feeling. While ignoring it is still Windows games that are being written, by game studios targeting regular Windows deployments, and those same studios might even have Android games written in OpenGL ES/Vulkan, that they won't bother porting to GNU/Linux. reply Zhyl 5 hours agorootparentI don't really understand the issue. I click on 'play' on Steam and the game works. That's all that matters to me. reply pjmlp 5 hours agorootparentMight be, doesn't change the fact those are Windows games. reply Zhyl 5 hours agorootparentBut hang on, your original comment was slating Linux for people saying that it was an escape for the past 30 years. It is now an escape for an ever increasing audience and set of use cases, and you're saying that these new people who have to this point not had any issues with running Windows games won't be able to \"escape\" because they'd have to play Windows games? Have some consistency. reply pjmlp 5 hours agorootparent2% after 30 years is hardly an ever increasing audience. Proton is not an escape when it is still Windows software, using Windows APIs, written by companies targeting Windows customers. reply Zhyl 4 hours agorootparentI love how you leapt on 'audience' there and didn't want to refute use cases. Also leaning on that '30 year' figure. Funny. The Steam Deck has sold millions of units (increase in audience) and now supports 89% of the top 1000 games at Silver and above (increase in use case). 2% is indeed an increase from where it started in 2018, but it goes to show how many Windows machines are out there that the % isn't higher. I don't really understand your position. You're vehemently against any Windows code or games running at all and want to belittle, minimise or dismiss any progress that has been made. It feels like you're arguing in bad faith. reply pjmlp 17 minutes agorootparentWhat use cases? That Linux gamers are so starving for Linux native games that they have to contend with running Windows games via an API translation layer? Not even studios that target other POSIX platforms bother targeting GNU/Linux natively. SteamDeck sales are a drop in the ocean of Switch, Playstation, XBox, and Windows PC sales, if you feeling like going into war numbers. But hey, enjoy your \"Linux\" games. tapoxi 4 hours agorootparentprevI mean sure it's not using native APIs, but many developers are specifically targeting Steam Deck to get a Steam Deck Verified label and show up prominently on the Steam Store. So despite developing for Windows, they are doing QA on Linux. reply bigstrat2003 4 hours agorootparentprev> Proton is Windows PC gaming with a Linux kernel. Who the hell cares? Besides RMS I suppose, but he wouldn't want to run closed source games to begin with. reply deno 4 hours agorootparentprevProton is the only stable and maintained runtime you can target for Linux and it comes with no performance penalty. Few games actually get more fps than on Windows. What alternative runtime would you suggest and more to the point what problem would it actually solve. If the game studio actually so much as tests on Proton (or more realistically Steam Deck) that’s great gold medal and as much targeting Linux as you can get. Demanding anything more is not realistic given current market share, but also again what would you even gain. The actual threat to gaming on Linux is any form of DRM. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentWith the increasing efforts from Asus, MSI, Lenovo, and the potential XBox Handheld that keeps being hyped about, let's see how long SteamDeck keeps its relevance. reply tapoxi 4 hours agorootparentThe Deck is tied into the most popular PC games store, and one with followers so loyal they'll refuse to buy a game until it comes to Steam because they don't want another launcher. It'll do fine. People don't want to re-buy their gaming libraries for an Xbox handheld and the OS integration for the other devices is pretty poor. reply arepublicadoceu 4 hours agorootparentprev> it comes with no performance penalty. I keep reading this on the internet and I’m fully convinced that this is written by people with powerful machines. Whenever I try to play a game that barely runs at 60 fps on windows in my basic system it invariably runs in the range of 45-55 fps on Linux. This would be perfectly acceptable except that it eventually leads to stutters that I never experienced on windows.. Ps. Yeah I tried to troubleshoot this with everything google and ChatGPT had to offer: disable composers, different proton versions, different distros and different desktops environments. The matter of the fact is that there’s an overhead and if your system is barely running it on windows you will probably have performance headaches on Linux. reply wing-_-nuts 3 hours agorootparentYeah I mean if you look at windows vs linux gaming benchmarks on phoronix it's clear there's about a 10% performance penalty. On the other hand there's a 10% penalty using bitlocker on windows vs almost none on linux, so it evens out if you care about privacy. Also you know for certain MS isn't keylogging everything you type to some godforsaken MS service, and the developer experience on linux is miles better. reply deno 2 hours agorootparentprev> Whenever I try to play a game that barely runs at 60 fps on windows in my basic system it invariably runs in the range of 45-55 fps on Linux. This is not a valid test. You need to compare Linux native vs. Proton rather than (Proton+Linux) vs. Windows. Otherwise you’re comparing at least three things at once. reply bluejay2387 5 hours agoparentprevDue to all this mess with Recall, force account log-ins, spamming my desktop with crap all the time, not being able to to disable telemetry, confusing privacy settings spread all through out the OS... I finally made the call two weeks ago to get rid of Windows after decades of using the Microsoft OS. I tried Pop, Ubuntu, Mint... all decent options but settled on Debian for now. It's been a slog of a two weeks and one massive learning curve, but everything is now setup and working great. I have 100% parity with my previous Windows install and it was a freeing experience being able to delete my Windows partition. My biggest problem was with video drivers. I have some utilities that require at least Nvidia 535 and Debian for some reason I can't fathom only supports 525 (obsolete by Nvidia's indication). All of the advice in Debian related forums was \"don't go with proprietary install scripts\" which was flat out wrong. I don't know what is causing this brain failure on the part of the entire Debian community when it comes to drivers, but they need to fix that. No need to run the latest and greatest, but when the only option is a driver that is marked as obsolete and won't run a lot of software, it needs to be addressed. The pleasant surprise has been games. I thought I would have to abandon gaming or keep a second Windows partition, but so far all the games I have tried have run 100% -- even though it took some minimal tweaking in some cases. V-Rising, Elder Scrolls Online, New World, RimWorld... all work as well as on Windows thanks to Steam and Proton. (Rimworld required one change in the config .ini to support my super ultra wide monitor, ESO had to be manually imported into Steam. V-Rising required installing the Proton-GE version to address a problem with cut scenes). It's a bit tedious to have to address small problems like that, but more than worth it to get rid of an OS that I feel is constantly trying to attack me. I am moving my wife to Zorin next. I can't recommend Debian to most people that just want to use a desktop. It was difficult for me and I have decades of experience in running Linux servers. I will probably stick with Debian as its working great now, but too many things were too hard to make it an option for most desktop users I would imagine. I can recommend ditching Windows for some flavor of Linux. reply CoastalCoder 5 hours agorootparentFWIW, I found Pop_OS to provide pretty (very?) up-to-date Nvidia drivers via the pop_os repos. So I haven't found any reason to use Nvidia's installers. reply bluejay2387 4 hours agorootparentYeah I didn't have any problems with this on Pop or Ubuntu. I guess its a Debian issue. I might end up moving over to a different distro at some point, but I finally have everything working on Debian so I am hesitant to switch right now. reply xattt 5 hours agoparentprevBoiling pot escape is not possible if said lobsters have been humanely euthanized. reply CoastalCoder 5 hours agorootparentOkay, huge tangent, but just yesterday at the dinner table this came up. I realized I've shied away from the horrors of boiling live lobsters, and I'm not okay with doing it any more. I need to learn how to kill them less painfully prior to cooking. And I doubt I can eat restaurant lobster in good conscience any more. reply xattt 4 hours agorootparentYou can usually euthanize the lobster before cooking it by spiking it at the top of its head, or by freezing it. At some point, there’s a personal decision to be made as to whether the inhumanity of eating a crustacean that was alive shortly before cooking is any different than the inhumanity of predator-prey relationships in the wild. reply delfinom 5 hours agoparentprev [–] Does it have a gui based update manager that doesn't require me to enter my password because it ducktapes sudo on top? God, the ubuntu one is the worst as it'll sometimes prompt multiple times for a password. reply neilv 5 hours agorootparent [–] IME, the GUI updates work out of the box with the default Debian desktop, no prompting for passwords.

I also checked RPM metadata which includes build time. The experiment ran for (IIRC) about two months. Oracle was consistently the first, lagging behind RHEL for a few hours (for important stuff) to a couple of days (for less important ones). Alma was a very close second. Rocky would spend days to weeks and was by far the slowest. No, I don't buy the argument that it's good for you because they receive additional testing. If you really need that much stability that you can't take an update after RHEL has done so, introduce your own delays and test your shit on staging. I'd like my upstream to be as quick as practically possible. Oracle and Alma cover that nicely. All this might have changed in the meantime. reply eraser215 5 hours agorootparentprevCentOS stream is red hat. reply Twirrim 5 hours agorootparentprevThat'll only buy you several months.

It just gets harder and harder to upgrade, as i wrote further down my preferred upgrade time-frame is 3-5 years max. reply bboozzoo 5 hours agorootparentprevIs Oracle committed to actually supporting the distro with security updates and so on? I was under the impression that it's simply a bug-for-bug compatibility rebuild from RHEL sources, which aside from rebuilding effort, the majority of support work was still done by RH. reply lye 5 hours agorootparentIt's a rebuild with a few more patches on top (like ksplice). If you need a RHEL rebuild, they're the first to release security updates of any of the rebuilds I've tested. See my other comment for more info.

They have a huge commercial interest in not unnecessarily sharing money with Red Hat for customers that basically need a supported/certified platform primarily for their Oracle products. SUSE has had fairly recent management changes (including ex-Red Hatters coming in).

At first, I thought it was just to reduce the complexity of managing hardening rules for several OS and OS versions. reply IsTom 7 hours agoparentRecently we had issues with RH 9 not having header packages for openssl 1.1 (which means e.g. you can't have erlang 9 in an automated way (is it possible?) and i'm unsure how we'd recover if there was a hiccup in that process. possible good news is that we'd been forced to use more machines a few years ago due to some IT policy about databases not being colocated on the same physical instance as the application(s) accessing it, which forced multiple servers when fewer were needed. I was told that's not a hard requirement any longer, which may allow us to consolidate some pieces during a rebuild. reply bayindirh 7 hours agoparentprevThere are whole niche ecosystems started on Scientific Linux and moved to CentOS over the last decade.

Also, you can re-install a cattle worker node in 10 minutes or less, from power on. reply eraser215 5 hours agorootparentWhat breaking changes do those upgrades introduce? Is there any compatibility guide? reply bayindirh 4 hours agorootparentDebian handles all of these transitions by itself during upgrade process, and shows you a nice readme before starting all of them. For example, Debian has finished two big transitions recently. Merging /usr and 64 bit time support. Both are done on testing, and even on testing nothing has broken. Another big change (which also made HN front page via LWN) was /tmp behavior change. It's handled differently. If your system is already installed, it doesn't change the behavior, but new systems will behave differently. All of these changes are again communicated via \"NEWS\" mechanism. If Debian changes a config file, it's replaced. If you modified this file, apt will ask what you prefer, and you can diff the file in place. In the past, many similar changes are made, and all were transparent. If you're not using any external repositories which change tons of system packages with their own versions, nothing changes during upgrades for you. While there's an extensive release note provided with every release like [0], the upgrades are pretty straightforward. As a result, having a few or many Debian systems which are older than a decade is a norm, not an exception.

Why the anger though? reply bluedino 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are a lot of HPC sysadmins that are very busy lately. A lot of third party software started dropping CentOS 7 support this year, and they never upgraded their clusters to 8/9. Containers have been a big help. reply bayindirh 6 hours agorootparentThe situation is pretty backwards for us, ironically. Upgrading the OS is easy. Initial work is a couple of days, rest of the deployment is an hour or so, but the software we need to run doesn't support CentOS 7+. Containerization might help or not, but most software is distributed as RPM packages and some of them are written with things like Python2.7. reply adolph 7 hours agorootparentprevAs the IBM constructorships’ beams cut up this ecosystem you kind of see why the head Vogon has no sympathy because the plans have not been “in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying ‘Beware of the Leopard.’” reply major505 8 hours agoparentprevJust curious.

Aside from that, Rocky Linux also seems like a great choice for many: https://rockylinux.org/ Some also say that AlmaLinux is pretty good: https://almalinux.org/ Personally, I found RPM distros to be quite stable but have largely moved over to Ubuntu LTS for servers (technically Debian also has a LTS release, but it’s not as mainstream) and Linux Mint locally (largely Ubuntu without focus on snaps and the Cinnamon desktop is pleasant), it’s been working pretty well so far.

My first question was \"what's the replacement for aptitude\", and people pointed me to \"yum shell\". It was not as good, but I got used to it, and went with it. If you run \"aptitude\" on debian, without any argument, you end up in a TUI, you can use it to install or remove packages from your system, and then see the \"preview\" of the change, and apply/cancel the change. The same way people use \"yum shell\". I'm used to new \"dnf shell\", so I don't miss aptitude anymore, but I think aptitude is what you're looking for. reply Algent 6 hours agorootparentInteresting, in my head aptitude was an ubuntu thing so I never tried in debian.

The thing with CentOS was that, especially latterly after the CentOS team was acquired by Red Hat, many saw CentOS--as a downstream rebuild from RHEL sources, albeit with a different build system--as a semi-supported version of RHEL for free. For people who don't want CentOS Stream, i.e. basically the nightly RHEL builds, the lack of having a versioned CentOS mirroring RHEL versions coming out of Red Hat (for about the last 10 years) puts them in somewhat uncharted waters even if they could pick one of the RHEL alternatives and \"probably\" be fine. reply EasyMark 3 hours agoparentprevDepends on if you have a heavy base using it.

Convert2rhel has been a nightmare, only a few have worked properly the first time. I've had 8 tickets opened with Redhat. Once I get one working, the next one will fail with different problems. 2. LEAPP from 7.9 to 8.9 hasn't worked successfully yet. When it does it breaks absolutely everything from PHP to mail sending to databases. 3. I thought Alma might solve the problem, nope. Similar issues as point number 2. Or I get Python errors, or any variety of anything else.

Converting to rhel should be easy if you aren't doing anything that red hat wouldn't support in rhel. reply quantumfissure 5 hours agorootparentYeah, I thought so too (since they're only moving from COS signed to RH signed), but it's hard to describe. I've had everything from proxy issues; to python; to PHP-fpm breaking after the upgrade. It's just a constant flood of 1 step forward 3 back. Some from random gremlins. For example, last week I wanted to try a test conversion of a box to Alma linux and it worked fine, but broke PHP, so I had to revert the snapshot. This week, the analysis blows up completely, despite nothing changing on the box.

IMO, the versioning should follow a pattern of 2024.01, 2025.03, etc.. and updates should be seamless. reply dralley 5 hours agoparent [–] Enterprise linux distributions pin package versions through the entire \"major\" release. They get security backports and often feature backports (for the first few years) but nothing which would change an API or ABI - for 10+ years. As such, the answer to your question is \"pretty much everything\". Wildly different kernel, libraries, etc. In theory it would be nice to roll upgrades like you suggest, but there are huge swathes of industry for which it's not a practical solution. reply eraser215 5 hours agorootparent [–] ...

When abstract syntax trees are defined as an algebraic data type, for example, they can easily be extended with new consumers, such as print or eval, but adding a new constructor requires the modification of all existing pattern matches. The expression problem is one way to elucidate the difference between functional or data-oriented programs (easily extendable by new consumers) and object-oriented programs (easily extendable by new producers). This difference between programs which are extensible by new producers or new consumers also exists for dependently typed programming, but with one core difference: Dependently-typed programming almost exclusively follows the functional programming model and not the object-oriented model, which leaves an interesting space in the programming language landscape unexplored. In this paper, we explore the field of dependently-typed object-oriented programming by deriving it from first principles using the principle of duality. That is, we do not extend an existing object-oriented formalism with dependent types in an ad-hoc fashion, but instead start from a familiar data-oriented language and derive its dual fragment by the systematic use of defunctionalization and refunctionalization. Our central contribution is a dependently typed calculus which contains two dual language fragments. We provide type- and semantics-preserving transformations between these two language fragments: defunctionalization and refunctionalization. We have implemented this language and these transformations and use this implementation to explain the various ways in which constructions in dependently typed programming can be explained as special instances of the phenomenon of duality.

This book writes really impractical Java, but in such a Scheme way, that you really can understand the deep connections between functional and object-oriented programming. reply liquid_bluing 10 hours agoparentOne of the most mind-bending papers on this topic is William Cook’s On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~wcook/Drafts/2009/essay.pdf “Object interfaces are essentially higher-order types, in the same sense that passing functions as values is higher-order. Any time an object is passed as a value, or returned as a value, the object-oriented program is passing functions as values and returning functions as values. The fact that the functions are collected into records and called methods is irrelevant. As a result, the typical object-oriented program makes far more use of higher-order values than many functional programs.“ reply abecedarius 3 hours agorootparentWhenever there's another interminable thread about, like, what is OO really and how thoroughly does it suck? I wish everyone knew this short paper as background. Teaser: the first OO language was Church's lambda calculus. reply voidhorse 1 hour agorootparentBut OO does suck, not because it is fundamentally different from the lambda calculus, but because it puts a kludgy set of handles that makes it easy to make bad decisions in front of a good, sound computational core. Of course, just like any advanced tool, an advanced practitioner can use traditional OO languages well, but the paradigm makes it just as easy for noobies to fall into pitfalls as does classical imperative programming, if not more so. At the end of the day, all languages that are turing complete are the same language and the only differences lie in the kind of front end we provide. Unfortunately, we basically still have a single frontend, called C and every subsequent programming language has essentially just taken the C frontend and restricted or expanded it in small ways. We still ultimately work in terms of records, contiguous arrays and pointers. You can think of basically any more \"advanced\" construct in terms of pointers and it will make perfect sense nearly every time. reply bruce343434 9 hours agorootparentprevI think the best example of this is the strategy pattern.

    "originBody": "This article is going to show you how to convert your (existing) wired doorbell (also works for battery-powered chimes) into a smart, WiFi-enabled, doorbell. The essential components needed sets you back about $2, yes, that is correct, just two bucks. No soldering is required and you don’t have to be an electronics expert. The result of this DIY Smart Doorbell project on my test bench, ready to be installed Integrating your doorbell into your smart home is a very logical step to take. Making your doorbell smart, allows you to do cool things with it, for example: Turn the chime/bell off after a specific time, when the kids or you went to bed. Also, turn it on again in the morning. Send out push notifications to your phone/tv/watch/smart speaker, on the doorbell button push. Take a snapshot from a front door camera, on the doorbell button push. Stream your front door camera to your TV, on the doorbell button push. Ring the doorbell continuously in case of an emergency (e.g., smoke detectors triggered). I have provided some of these automations for Home Assistant, as an example, at the end of this article. The method I provide is, of course, not the only solution. However, I guarantee it is the cheapest out there and a great way to get into DIY. The feeling of having it made yourself is satisfactory beyond any other solution. Are you curious yet?

Before we start doing anything, let’s take a quick look at how a wired doorbell works. For this article, I am going to assume a wired and AC powered doorbell. However, battery-powered chimes are not that different, and I’ll provide instructions for that as well. Regular doorbell circuit schema A pretty standard doorbell set up has a power supply, hooked up directly to the chime. Prevent the doorbell chime going continuously, the circuit is interrupted by the doorbell button, which acts as a switch. The circuit is only active/complete when the doorbell button is pushed. Hence, your chime turns on when someone pushes the doorbell button. DIY Smart doorbell circuit schema The image above should give you an idea of the result of this article. Basically, you are going to split your doorbell circuit into two separate circuits. One circuit detects the doorbell button push; the other circuit controls the chime. This split allows for controlling those separately, e.g., detecting a doorbell push from Home Assistant, without activating the chime. The device we are using is going to act as a sensor for the doorbell button push, and acts as a switch for the chime. Effectively, we are moving the activation of the chime from the doorbell button, to the new device. Our new device needs power, and since the one used consumes 5 volts. Any old USB phone charger you have, does the job just fine. Smart doorbell stuff you’ll need To achieve this, you need some “stuff”. The $2 price tag is based on the actual device we are going to create, however, if you don’t have some of the needed tools, that would raise the total price. Nevertheless, the additional stuff is really cheap and are things that, in my humble opinion, every DIY home automator should have in their toolbox (for future projects). Based on the country you are in, additional shipping costs may apply. I live in the Netherlands, and I’ve paid 1,80EUR in total, including shipping. Checking out the different sites for the right price helps. I’ve noticed the prices for these little boards vary, but getting it for around $2 is doable. The main components This project consists of just 2 parts. An ESP8266-based chip called the ESP-01S and a small board with a relay on it. ESP-01S The ESP-01S is one of the smallest WiFi boards available, that works ESPHome and Home Assistant. Relay module This relay module board for the ESP-01(S), It comes pre-soldered, and the ESP will just slide on top of it. Buy them in bundle The nice thing about these two is that they fit together, are pre-soldered and often sold together. There is also another version of the ESP chip, without the S, the ESP-01. That chip is viable for use as well, however, the ESP-01S is an improved version and has double the amount of memory. Since the price difference is just a couple of cents, I would highly recommend getting the S version. The board needs to be powered and requires 5 Volts. Lucky, most phone chargers provide those and I’m sure most of you have an old one around you could use. That brings me to the shopping list of the main components needed: An ESP-01S The relay module board for the ESP-01(S) An old phone charger, delivering 5 Volts Other tools and hardware Besides the main components, you’ll need some other things for building it as well. Without a doubt, you need some screwdrivers and a wire stripper. A pair of tweezers can also help put wires to place, and for modifying to the board later on. The ESP01-S chip needs to be programmed. To do that, you’ll need an FTDI adapter. If you have ever flashed ESP chips before (e.g., SonOff switches), you probably already have one. If not, you should get one! It is an essential tool to have when you are into home automation. FTDI Adapter An FT232RL FTDI USB To serial converter adapter is a must a have for any smart home enthusiastic to have in its toolbox. Click here to get one Additionally, some wire is needed. I always have a bunch of Dupont cables in stock. They are really helpful in many many projects I’ve done. It allows you to wire up prototypes really quickly as well. Dupont wires Having a collection of Dupont wires with different male/female connector combinations, is useful to have around. It allows for quick DIY prototypes, but useful in final projects as well. Dupont crimper Alternatively, create your own Dupont wires using a wire crimper. It is way more flexible compared to pre-made wires. Depending on where you are going to place the smart doorbell, you might be need a case as well. The resulting board is pretty small. Maybe it can already fit one of your electrical boxes. Another option is getting a small project box online, like this one: Small project box Small project boxes really finish a DIY project and make them look slick while protecting the electronics as well. For this project, a small box like this does the trick. Needed software Obviously, you need some software to pull this off. All software used is open source and free for you to use. Home Assistant ESPHome ESPHome Flasher Home Assistant is my home automation hub of choice, and for this guide, I assume you are using it as well. However, this project can be used on other hubs as well (like Domoticz or OpenHAB). I’ve added a section at the end of the article for more information about this. Modifying to the ESP-01S chip To make this setup work, you would have to make a small modification to the ESP-01S chip. Reason for this modification is that you have to free up an additional pin for connecting your doorbell button. These input/output pins, are called GPIO pins. The ESP-01S has two GPIO pins available. Using the relay board, one of the GPIO pins is wired to the relay, the other is wired to a reset mechanism. Without this modification, a doorbell button push would result in a reset/restart of the chip, which of course, isn’t what we want. Don’t worry, this modification is easy. We need to bend the GPIO2 pin from the ESP-01S. This allows you to access the pin for connecting the doorbell button, while disconnecting it from the relay board. The lost reset functionality is later be restored via a software switch in ESPHome. Furthermore, the reset button on the side of the relay board isn’t affected by this and keeps working as a reset button as well. Flashing the firmware on the chip This project uses ESPHome to create firmware for the ESP-01S chip. I’m not going to make a full tutorial on how to set up ESPHome since that is really well covered on their website. So, before continuing, make sure you’ve set up ESPHome. Getting Started with ESPHome (for Hass.io users) Getting Started with ESPHome (when not on Hass.io) For the rest of this guide, I’m going to assume you are running Hass.io. However, the ESPHome getting started guide for non-Hass.io users is extremely detailed, and you should be able to adapt easily. Creating, building and downloading the firmware Create a file called doorbell.yaml; for Hass.io users, create the file in the /config/esphome folder, so you end up with the file: /config/esphome/doorbell.yaml. Next, add the following contents to the file:---esphome:name: doorbellplatform: ESP8266board: esp01_1m# WiFi connection, correct these# with values for your WiFi.wifi:ssid: !secret wifi_ssidpassword: !secret wifi_password# Enable logging.logger:# Enable Home Assistant API.api:# Enable over-the-air updates.ota:# Enable Web server.web_server:port: 80# Sync time with Home Assistant.time:- platform: homeassistantid: homeassistant_time# Text sensors with general information.text_sensor:# Expose ESPHome version as sensor.- platform: versionname: Doorbell ESPHome Version# Expose WiFi information as sensors.- platform: wifi_infoip_address:name: Doorbell IPssid:name: Doorbell SSIDbssid:name: Doorbell BSSID# Sensors with general information.sensor:# Uptime sensor.- platform: uptimename: Doorbell Uptime# WiFi Signal sensor.- platform: wifi_signalname: Doorbell WiFi Signalupdate_interval: 60s# Global to store the on/off state of the chimeglobals:- id: chimetype: boolrestore_value: trueinitial_value: 'true'# Exposed switches.switch:# Switch to restart the doorbell.- platform: restartname: Doorbell Restart# Switch to turn on/off the chime.- platform: gpioid: relayinverted: truename: Doorbell Chimepin: GPIO0# Switch to turn on/off chime when# doorbell button is pushed.## It creates a \"virtual\" switch based# on a global variable.- platform: templatename: Doorbell Chime Activeid: chime_activerestore_state: falseturn_on_action:- globals.set:id: chimevalue: 'true'turn_off_action:- globals.set:id: chimevalue: 'false'lambda: |-return id(chime);# Binary sensor representing the# Doorbell button push.binary_sensor:- platform: gpioid: buttonname: Doorbell Buttonpin:# Connected to GPIO on the ESP-01S.number: GPIO2mode: INPUT_PULLUPinverted: truefilters:# Small filter, to debounce the button press.- delayed_on: 25ms- delayed_off: 25mson_press:# Only turn on the chime when it is active.then:if:condition:- switch.is_on: chime_activethen:- switch.turn_on: relayon_release:# On release, turn of the chime.- switch.turn_off: relay view raw doorbell.yaml hosted with ❤ by GitHub The above file shows a ESPHome project definition; the ESPHome project code, or also referred to as ESPHome YAML. The code describes the firmware allowing ESPHome to generate it. I’ve have tried to add as much additional text as possible to the above, to help you understand how it works. On line 9 & 10, make sure to set your WiFi details or else you might end up with failures. Save the file and open up the ESPHome web interface; The doorbell project should appear! Now, you should be able to validate, build and download the firmware from ESPHome. Let me show you a screen recording on how that works: Doorbell ESPHome: Validate, compile and download Uploading the firmware to the ESP-01S chip Flashing my ESP-01S for the smart doorbell Now you have the firmware (the downloaded doorbell.bin), you can start putting it onto the ESP-01S chip for use. This flashing procedure is the hardest part, and if you are new to this, please have some patience, it might need a couple of tries for you get it right. Start with wiring up the ESP-01S chip to the FTDI adapter, using some Dupont wires. Don’t freak out now, we only need to do this once. Once you’ve flashed the chip, future flashing/upgrades can be done Over-the-Air (OTA) via WiFi. Wire the FTDI & ESP-01S according to the following wire schematic: FTDI to ESP-01S Wiring Schema Make sure to double-check the wiring and set the FTDI to 3.3V. Even if you are an experienced flasher of ESP chips, please note, the VCC/3.3V and ground wires being double wired! Although, I’ve used a very common FTDI board in this schema, your FTDI might look different, ensure you wiring up correctly by verifying the names on your board. Ready to flash? Good! Plugin the FTDI adapter to your PC, and start-up the ESPHome Flasher tool. Yes, I know, it is possible to flash directly from ESPHome itself, however, if you are like me: I don’t have the machine running Home Assistant near my desk. Furthermore, it can be quite a challenge for people running Hass.io on a virtual machine. The ESPHome Flasher is easy to use and just works from your desktop. Select the available serial port, and load the downloaded doorbell.bin file, by clicking the “Browse” button. Start the flash procedure by clicking the “Flash ESP” button. The console shows you the progress and tells you when it finishes. Flashing firmware using the ESPHome Flasher If this process fails, please make sure to check your wiring. A common mistake is mixing up the TX/RX wires between the FTDI & the ESP-01S. They should be cross-connected (TX -> RX, RX -> TX). Installing and wiring your smart doorbell Time to install your newly created smart doorbell. The following schema helps you to connect the wires correctly. DIY Doorbell Wiring Guide Please note, how the ground wire from the phone charger is shared with the push button. To hook up the push button to the bent GPIO-2 pin, I recommend using a Dupont wire, since you can slide it right onto the pin in that pretty tight space. Wiring the GPIO-2 pin with a Dupont wire If your chime is a battery-powered one, the schema does not differ that much. Just act like the transformer is not in the above image. The two connections from the battery-powered chime, connect directly connect to the board (to the COM and NO labeled ports). Done? Awesome! Pushing the doorbell button should now ring the chime already! So basically, you’ve now ended up with what you had already… Now you can continue to configure your smart doorbell in Home Assistant, let the fun begin! Integrating with Home Assistant Welcome to the easier part of this guide. Integrating your new, self-created, smart doorbell with Home Assistant. Home Assistant will discovery it automatically. The only thing you need to do is to activate it and unlock a bunch of new entities for you to play with. This screen recording shows how that works: Integrating the ESPHome DIY smart doorbell with Home Assistant Home Assistant smart doorbell automations At this point, you have a WiFi-enabled doorbell. Is it smart already? Not really… Adding some automations to Home Assistant would make it really smart! There are many automations one could create with this. However, let me give you a couple of basic and useful examples. Sending notifications to your phone This little automation sends a notification to our phone when someone is at the door. We have Apple iPhones and watches, so those notifications would end up on our wrist as well, even if the chime is disabled!---# This automation triggers when the doorbell button is pushed# and sends out a notification to our Apple iPhones/watches.#automation:- alias: \"Doorbell Notifications\"trigger:platform: stateentity_id: binary_sensor.doorbell_buttonto: 'on'action:- service: notify.mobile_app_frencks_iphonedata:title: Doorbellmessage: Ding dong!

Use pressure sensors in your bed to turn off the chime when sleeping. Create a camera snapshot when someone is at the door, and send it out to your phone. Use the chime as an alarm bell as well, e.g., in case smoke or water leak is detected. Use facial recognition on your front door camera, to disable the doorbell for the ones you don’t want to open the door for. E.g., an unknown person or your mother in law 😈 Prevent over abuse of doorbell pushes, by disabling it for a couple of minutes after it was pushed. Hook the doorbell chime active switch into your voice assistant, allowing you to say “Hey Google, turn off the doorbell” Optional changes and modifications There are probably a hundred variations on this approach I took, but that was not the point of this guide. However, some are worth mentioning. Using the chimes’ power supply using a step-down In my case, my doorbell chime is powered by 8 Volts (DC) from the transformer. While to voltage is too high for the board, I could have used a little regulator to “step-down” from the 8 Volts to the 5 Volts required by the board. DC Voltage Regulator Step Down 4.75V-12V to 5V 800mA The pin headers are usually delivered separately, so this would require soldering. These “step-down” are available for around a dollar on AliExpress. However, since I have enough older chargers I could use, and do have a power outlet available in my utility closet (where the doorbell wires are at); I saved myself the extra buck 😉. Using multiple doorbell buttons (e.g., front- & backdoor) In some homes, there are multiple doorbells. E.g., one for the front door, the other for the back door. Mostly they are connected to the same chime. There are three ways to use this guide in those cases: Connect the doorbell push buttons in parallel to a single chip. This is fast and cheap, however, you cannot distinguish which button was pushed. Connect two of those boards in parallel to the chime. You would need two boards and one chime, however, you can still distinguish the doorbell pushed. Replace the ESP-01S and relay board with one of the bigger brothers. Those provide more GPIO pins. However, it would be more expensive compared to using just two of this project. Using MQTT (e.g., for use with OpenHAB) Are you not using Home Assistant? Really? Or maybe you prefer to use MQTT with OpenHAB, Node-RED or Domoticz. Well, you can use this project as well! ESPHome provides an MQTT interface. For more information about using MQTT with ESPHome, refer to the ESPHome MQTT Client Component documentation. This article is not about a smart doorbell… I hope you enjoy your DIY smart doorbell! However, now the time has come for me to come clean. This article was never about the doorbell! This article is about showing you how easy, fun, and cheap DIY smart home solutions are. ESPHome & Home Assistant are just amazing tools to allow everyone to jump in and create amazing things. The ESP-01S is an amazingly cheap and tiny ESP8266-based board, that is rarely considered or discussed nowadays. Mostly you’ll find articles and references to her big brothers; the ESP8266 and ESP32. However, if you need just one or two GPIO pins, it is a viable option. Consider this: Replace “doorbell” with “bedside LED light” in this article… 🤯. Anything with a switch and/or button can be replaced by this board (stay within the power limits of course). But did you know, you can buy other module boards for the ESP-01S as well? RGB LED module This RGB led module goes for about a dollar and can control addressable LED strips like the WS2813. Breakout module This little board breaks out the pins from the ESP. Helpful if you want to be able to remove the ESP from your project. DHT11 Module The DHT11 module allows you to build a simple temperature and humidity sensor. Did you build the doorbell? Nice! I love to see how you did! Send me a picture of the result via Twitter! ../Frenck",

Would you maybe share with us how you built it/which parts you used? reply gh02t 4 hours agorootparentAmcrest AD110 doorbell connected over wifi to a recycled HP mini-PC (can be had cheaply on Amazon) running Frigate (https://frigate.video/) with a Google Coral accelerator installed in one of the internal slots. The Amcrest doorbell does have a cloud video connection if you want, but I firewalled it off from the internet and use the local RTSP streaming over to Frigate. Frigate talks to my local Home Assistant install too for automation. Also built a little buzzer with an ESP8266 and a simple piezo buzzer that runs ESPHome, which Home Assistant can use to play little sounds for stuff like person at the front door, lightning strikes in the area, etc... whatever you want to. The doorbell also has a local API to expose notifications when the button is pressed, which you can link to HA with amcrest2mqtt. The wifi connection for the doorbell isn't ideal for security purposes, but it's good enough and a lot easier than getting CAT5 to my doorbell. It is more or less 100% reliable with my home wifi setup, though again I'm not really counting on it for any sort of reliable home security. OP is absolutely right tho that this setup requires work to put together and maintain. Configuring Frigate can be especially confusing, but there are other local options like BlueIris (paid, and Windows only which kills it for me but it is very capable). I've been in this game for many years so it's all easy to me, but getting started is definitely a learning curve. Very fun though, if it's your sort of thing. The DIY home automation community is in a bit of a golden age right now, IMO. reply jaeckel 4 hours agorootparentThanks! reply EricE 4 hours agorootparentprevThe Ubiquity doorbell also does local person and package detection in addition to standard motion detection. Indeed, it has a second camera aimed down specifically to detect packages: https://ui.com/us/en/camera-security/special-devices You also need a Protect NVR to record video, manage the camera and provide notifications - the Cloud Key Plus works perfectly for up to a dozen or so cameras (uses standard laptop hard drive) - but they have a variety of devices that can run Protect from the UDM Pro (also will serve as a router/firewall) to larger dedicated Protect NVRs with four or seven disks depending on how much storage you want. It can be a bit pricy for just a doorbell camera, but if you add a couple of other cameras then the value gets significantly better. Cloud is optional other than being required for initial configuration and is used for notifications, remote access and remote administration. reply EricE 4 hours agoparentprevFrom TFA: \"I hope you enjoy your DIY smart doorbell!

As a hobbiest you don’t recommend doing your own crimping at all, and I am willing to pay money, but I do kinda need specific lengths due to a tight enclosure without much room for excess ribbon (I guess round cable might be bit better). Is there such an option? I kinda searched for it, and on electronics retailers like digikey I didn’t really see the length I wanted, though it is easy to miss stuff on there. reply alright2565 4 hours agorootparent> A little hard to search for, but does this require a special crimper of its own?

Which makes sense, since the dupont connectors are a near-clone designed for cheaper production. > As a hobbiest you don’t recommend doing your own crimping at all I just don't find it very enjoyable, especially getting to the point where I have tools that are actually suitable! The IWISS SN025 is fairly new[1] and before I ran across Matt's blog, reliable information on this subject was hard to find. But I mean I have after all gone through the effort of getting tools and connectors, so it's more of a medium \"recommend against\" rather than a \"not worth doing at all\". It's almost like my preference with assembling PCBs. I don't mind that as much, and am good at it, but if I can just pay someone $20 to do it for me, I'll do that instead.

I crimped all wiring on my Voron myself, took some time getting used to it - but was almmost Zen-like meditation afterwards :) reply jrmg 4 hours agoparentprevWhat is the real-world problem you’re concerned about? Cheap tools may not crimp as well as the official tools (I have no doubt the differences in finished crimp geometry are real), but especially for low voltage connections like these, I have a hard time believing the end result is dangerous, or even particularly unreliable. reply alright2565 2 hours agorootparentI don't have a problem with cheap tools. The problem is that lots of the crimpers sold for dupont just are not designed for them at all. It makes a big difference for both how long it takes (these tiny connectors move around a bunch) and just a minimum level of crimp quality. reply buescher 4 hours agoparentprevNot only are most third-party crimp tools kind of marginal, but if you're buying connector kits of Amazon/ebay/Aliexpress etc you're getting knockoffs too, so you have a lot of degrees of quality freedom between your crimp pin and your tooling. And you're probably getting your connector and its mate from different manufacturers, too, which can have its own set of issues. reply zyberzero 5 hours agoprevI did something similar, but as I didn’t have access to mains in an easy way (read: close enough to the doorbell) to power the ESP I built a small PSU that took the very unregulated 8VAC from the doorbell transformer into 5VDC (using a rectifier, LM7805 for regulation and some capacitors to smooth everything out). Everything was small enough so I could hide it in the actual doorbell as well! reply gregmac 4 hours agoprevI did a very similar hack a while ago, but in my case, I have a Ubiquiti video door bell, and I was having issues with it sometimes rebooting when it tried to ring the chime (after a specific software update, but only when it was cold out. I still have no idea if this a hardware or software problem, but I got tired of trying to diagnose). Anyway, I also realized my chime wasn't audible in some parts of the house, so what I did instead was disable the hardwired chime completely, then get a fairly cheap wireless doorbell with 3 plug-in receivers scattered around the house. An esp8266 module (Wemos D1) is wired directly to the doorbell button, supplying 3.3V to ring it. I use Home Assistant to send the signal from the Unifi doorbell to the esp8266. The biggest downside is the need to have Home Assistant, Unifi Protect and Wifi all running for my doorbell to work, but at the same time, I have a lot of automations that stop without those, the doorbell is not that high on my list of critical priorities. People can knock. Kind of wish I had this when I had a baby that slept during the day: it would be trivial to schedule the chime not to ring at certain times of day.

Neither schematics nor my limited understanding of physics explains why you need to, nor how it is possible to, bend one of the pins to disconnect GPIO0 (chip-row, 3rd from the left) from the reset pin (edge-row, 2nd from the left)... Is it me? Have I been misusing my 8266s all this time? Otherwise, good article, nice idea, great conclusion! reply Someone 6 hours agoparentI’m almost ignorant on this device, but FTA (https://frenck.dev/diy-smart-doorbell-for-just-2-dollar/#2-t...) “This relay module board for the ESP-01(S), It comes pre-soldered, and the ESP will just slide on top of it.” So, bending that pin breaks a connection between the CPU board and the relais board, so that pressing the doorbell wouldn’t be able to send a reset signal to the CPU, or, as the article says: FTA: “Without this modification, a doorbell button push would result in a reset/restart of the chip, which of course, isn’t what we want” That made me wonder why the hardware is hooked up that way by default in a device that gets sold for this specific purpose. A few searches learnt me that the device has a deep sleep state where it uses very little power. The only way to wake it up externally from that state is through a reset. https://johnmu.com/quick-boot-button/ taught me that it can boot in about 100ms, and get WiFi on in a few seconds. => I think that keeping that pin in place is the intended way to use this hardware combo. The device would boot when the bell is rung, first close the relais switch to ring the bell, and then do any home automation stuff a few seconds later. Latencies look acceptable to me. I ideally would want to power it completely from the button push or, at least, from the same adapter as the doorbell, but both will be challenging. The first doesn’t deliver enough power for long enough, the second likely doesn’t run on 3.3V. reply leni536 6 hours agorootparent> The first doesn’t deliver enough power for long enough Charge up a capacitor, maybe? reply undecisive 5 hours agorootparentprevAhh! So it's not the ESP that has an extra connection, it's the relay breakout board. That makes much more sense. Yeah, I guess you would need to sound the doorbell every boot, and that might be inconvenient in places with a lot of power supply issues / loadshedding. That said, that quick-boot-button link? That's some brilliant info right there. reply krisoft 4 hours agorootparent> I guess you would need to sound the doorbell every boot Funny that the store bought wireless doorbell I have does exactly that. :D I guessed it does that to avoid/reduce returns from people who doesn't manage to pair it with the doorbell button and think that it is \"not working\".

The dev board the chip is soldered to already uses up one of them for the reset system, allowing the chip to programmatically reset the whole board. You’re basically undoing that so you can use it. I’m guessing the consequence is you can no-longer have the software reset the whole device anymore. And now if this is wrong, hopefully I’ll be corrected and we’ll learn more. :) reply undecisive 3 hours agorootparentCunningham's law baiting - I love it! So yeah, turns out it's nothing to do with the 8266's board, and everything to do with the chosen relay module. Since it has nothing to do with driving the relay, it doesn't need to be connected. But if it were connected, whenever it is high, the relay board connects it to the reset, so the chip gets reset. So you are bending it simply to ensure that pin can't be plugged in to the relay reply alias_neo 6 hours agoprevI think personally, I'd go with a simple Zigbee or Z-Wave push-button if (when) I were to re-do my doorbell setup. I use Home Assistant, with hundreds of devices in my home at this point. I spent so long looking for the right video doorbell and chime that I ultimately ended up with something both costly and somewhat unreliable. I use the Amcrest AD410 with a custom component that polls it (issue 1), with all of the cloud and online stuff blocked in my network, and an Aeotec Siren / Doorbell 6. The Aeotec siren is utter trash and I'm now on my third one; two units had the audio hardware fail, and a silent door bell is pretty useless. The one I have now hasn't failed yet, but it can be extremely unreliable and get lock-ups requiring me to open it and short out or de-solder the battery connector to get it to behave again if someone presses the doorbell too quick. The button part has never been the hard part; the siren is; given there seems to be so little, high quality, smart siren hardware available I'd probably build one half of this setup; bell/siren + ESP and use a Z-Wave or Zigbee button to \"push\" the action of pressing the bell and have HA \"ring\" it. Aside: Since the door chime is so unreliable, I have HA set up to announce the door on speakers, and lights to blink in various places when a press is detected too. I'd then finally replace the multi-purpose video doorbell with a dedicated IP camera and this simple button; As I live in the UK, RMAing my first AD410 was a hassle (had to send it back to the US when it failed), and I was without a doorbell for weeks. Since my front door is south-facing, the combination of direct sunlight, then cold cycles, coupled with heavy-handed delivery people smashing the button day in day out, basically crumbled the (matt black) casing to dust within 4 months of fitting it. It uses pogo pins to deliver power from the rear of the casing to the electronics so the compromised integrity of the casing resulted in it power cycling constantly. There are just too many unreliable and expensive parts to what is a simple yet essential function of being a door bell, and the lesson I've learned is that the video functionality is best _not_ integrated. I _do_ still want a smart door bell though for its many benefits. reply whazor 5 hours agoparentThe benefit of using ESPHome is that the chime would still ring if your bridge/server is down. reply alias_neo 4 hours agorootparentCan you tell me some more about that? I currently use ESPHome for a bunch of devices, but the automations they use are all driven through Home Assistant. Is there a way to link devices directly over the WiFi with ESPHome? EDIT: I think I understand what you meant now; not specifically ESPHome, but the nature of the deployment in the OP takes the \"smarts\" out of the critical path, allowing it to fall back to being an electro-mechanically actuated doorbell. This is certainly ideal, but I don't have anywhere I can place/power a chime near the doorbell hence the desire for a wireless connection between them. Would be great if I could somehow link two ESPHome devices wirelessly without the server so they can communicate if it's down (I suppose I could with an REST API if nothing else). reply whazor 2 hours agorootparentI meant in particular with ESPHome you can program automations that work if WiFi is down.

On the other hand, it's quite easy to see how following these directions to the T will take an enthusiast multiple hours to setup. Many existing smart doorbells do actually use the existing wiring and chime of the doorbell. An example is the Google Nest Doorbell. So in terms of \"wasting what you already have\" what you're wasting by going with a typical consumer product is basically a button that you can buy from Home Depot for $4.98. Now, obviously, someone interested in this project is probably not interested in having a proprietary Google camera on their door. But in my experience most people who want their doorbell to be \"smart\" actually want it to be a security camera and a two-way communication device so you can relay information to the person who is ringing the doorbell. Otherwise, what good is it to know that someone rang your doorbell when there is no other information? That amount of information is just like a random timestamp, at that point I'd just keep my dumb doorbell. reply bkuhns 5 hours agorootparentSure, the existing consumer smart doorbells serve exactly that need.

Note, I am not a lawyer or anyone who could professionally give an opinion on this.* The most egregious violation the author purports Apple did is the illegal venting of hazardous chemicals. IMHO, the most plausible evidence supporting the author's claim can be found in the (redacted) EPA report in observation #11.[1] My understanding is that waste streams (hazardous materials being vented into the environment) must be accounted for in order to accurately calculate how often you must change carbon filters (called breakthrough time in the report) and that carbon filters lose efficacy as hazardous gasses are passed through it. Anyways, the report found that Apple did not account for all the waste they were putting through the filters and thus could not accurately assess the \"breakthrough time\" of the filters. There is a plausible case that could be made that a filter had reached its \"breakthrough time\" -- potentially leaking hazardous gases into the environment. This reportedly has been occurring since atleast* Dec 2020, which could be around the time the author moved in which was also 2020 (unspecified range). Note, this neither confirms nor denies the claim that hazardous chemicals did leech into the air. 1. https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/312oqvretg7yyhfx0ohx4/AGZduVX... reply dang 1 hour agoparent [–] Please don't repost comments like this—it makes merging threads a pain.

Watch and car brands work the same way. Early on in these markets, you can get one of the desirable items without spending too much on undesirable items. Some examples: Rolex - stainless steel models are desirable and appreciate, gold models go for below msrp Porche - Bucking the trend a bit, Porche gives you the option of paying an additional dealer markup rather than making you buy a Macan to get a GT3 RS. Over time, this arbitrage goes to equilibrium and resellers can’t make money. It is relatively easy to get into this market so naturally it gets flooded. Profit goes to 0. Resellers also carry a risk that the item loses market value while they hold it. The only real winner here is the brand. reply blantonl 5 hours agoparentOn the watch side, there is some nuance here. Rolex stainless steel models are highly desirable, but they really don't appreciate in value. They simply sell on the secondary market for a >50% markup because they are still less expensive than a lot of the precious metal versions. So a rolex authorized dealer will typically have a huge ratio of buyers to watches available for steel watches. Precious metal rolexes - it's a big \"depends.\" Any of the platinum watches are highly desirable as well as the meteorite dial watches - they sell well above msrp on the secondary market. Note that rolex authorized dealers are not allowed to mark up new watches at all. The price is the price set by the brand. Most authorized distributors are also jewelers so they allocate steel sport watches to people who buy a lot of jewelry. Pateks are a different beast. The sport watches are highly desirable, and generally not available to the average buyer under any circumstances unless they have > $100K Patek spend, which means you're going to have to buy what is typically more of an art piece type watch (complication, calatrava, etc) before you'll get a shot at a $20K Patek sport watch. This means you can very easily get a beautiful brand new Patek dress watch for 20% off on the secondary market, since buyers will simply purchase that watch to get the spend history, immediately dump it on the secondary market at a big discount, just so they can get the opportunity to purchase a $20K watch and sell it for a >100% markup.

It sounds like the market just fixing a stupid sales model. reply samatman 2 hours agorootparentDoesn't look too stupid for Patek Philippe. These shenanigans are why they can charge $20k for a stainless steel automatic watch with a simple date complication, which is only slightly better (at best) than a $300 Seiko. reply OnACoffeeBreak 5 hours agorootparentprevWhen I think of \"sport\" I think of \"fitness\" watches from Garmin and Apple Watch. Patek sport watch is definitely not that. What is meant by \"sport\" in case of the Patek sport watch? reply eadmund 4 hours agorootparentA sport watch is not a dress watch, not a dive watch and not a field watch. It’s typically water-resistant, but not hugely water-resistant (swimming, rather than diving). It typically has a metal bracelet or a tropical rubber strap. A dress watch is thin, almost always with polished rather than brushed surfaces, rarely with a date complication, rarely with lume, sometimes without a second hand, with a leather strap. It’s meant to slide underneath a shirt cuff and be both elegant & discrete. It is probably not water-resistant. It may not have a minute track. A dive watch is meant for scuba diving. It will have one-way bezel marked with minutes for tracking dive time. It will be heavily lumed. It will typically have a metal bracelet. A field watch is based off of a WWI officer’s watch. It should be reasonably water-resistant (weirdly, many are not!). It will always have three hands, and must be hacking (means that the second hand will stop when you set the time, so that it can be set to the exact second). It probably has 13–24 in an inner circle. It definitely has a minute track. A Garmin or Apple Watch is … not really a watch, but is a wearable computer. reply nradov 3 hours agorootparentNote that hardly anyone has actually used those \"dive\" watches for diving in decades. A wealthy, fashion-conscious diver might wear a dive watch while traveling to the dive site, but for actual diving they'll take it off (don't want it lost or scratched!) and bring a cheaper modern digital dive computer (which might come in wristwatch format for certain models, thus further confusing the terminology). In diving circles, if you mention \"dive watch\" then most people will assume you're talking about a Shearwater or Garmin rather than some Swiss toy. reply eadmund 51 minutes agorootparent> Note that hardly anyone has actually used those \"dive\" watches for diving in decades. Yeah, the line about them is that they are ‘desk divers’! I have the idea that plenty of folks do still use them for diving, but of course I could be wrong — it’s not a community I am much around. reply criddell 5 hours agorootparentprevSports is really just the traditional name of the category. They are more casual watches. They will have a seconds hand and glow in the dark hands and markers. They will be able to tolerate getting wet (ie no leather). reply vundercind 1 hour agorootparentIt’s like how Oxford cloth button down shirts or cotton knit polos are sportswear, or a sport coat (it’s in the name!) or how jodhpur boots are “equestrian”, et c. They started that way, but not so much now. Still, that’s the lineage they fall under in certain contexts. reply theluketaylor 4 hours agorootparentprevIn the watch world sports watch means a tool watch, something designed for a specific purpose like supporting an occupation, military use, or while participating in a sport (mainly uppercrusty sports). Sports watches have taken over, and can really be thought of as everyday watches since people are wearing rolex submariners with tuxedos now. Sport watches started with things like the JLC Reverso, which was designed to meet a challenge of a watch that could survive a polo match. The case includes a swivel that lets the dial flip around to keep it protected while playing. Quartz watches upended watch makers across every price point, totally destroying the bottom of the market. The survivors moved towards mechanical watches as luxury items, and even the holy trinity of Audemars Piguet, Patek Philippe, and Vacheron Constantin had to respond. Audemars Piguet revealed the luxury sport watch Royal Oak in 1972 and there wasn't any going back. PP designed Nautilus in 1976 and Vacheron brought out the Overseas in 77. These 3 lines make up a huge chunk of the holy trintiy business now. reply quickthrowman 5 hours agorootparentprevNautilus and Aquanaut are what I think of as Patek ‘sport’ watches. reply mamonster 7 hours agoparentprevIn the watch market, a lot of the resellers who got in during COVID are still underwater.

Very few other categories of goods can get away with something like this. In some ways Rolex is like this but Rolex is relatively high production volume and there are many situations where you can get lucky and buy one relatively easily, especially now that the hype has died down a bit from 2021-2022. reply cletus 21 hours agoprevI find these systems fascinating. Hermes does make high-quality bags but really where they shine is in marketing. You see a similar thing play out in the mechanical watch world. Rolex is the master of marketing. They make a good product, make no mistake, but they don't over-produce models, still have scarcity despite selling millions of watches a year and have a limited inventory so Rolexes have the strongest secondary market. Compare this to Omega who simply produce too many watches and too many watch variants such that you just don't have the strong secondary market that Rolex has. This is despite Omega producing in some cases a better product in utility purposes (eg Planet Ocean vs Deepsea Sea-Dweller). But there's a dirty little secret with all these brands, including Hermes. As much as they say it's about spend ratios and the like, ultimately it comes down to whether or not they like you. If, as a woman, you're attractive, stylish and likely to be seen with their products (eg red carpet events) you will have WAY more offered to you than your spend ratio might otherwise warrant. reply jajko 10 hours agoparentSame goes ie for Ferrari. For those that don't know - you can buy 'cheap' V8 ie Californias, 458, 488, F8 etc, pretty much just like anything - you pay and get into queue, and once its your time, you get what you've selected with sales rep. Not so much the better V12 / hypercars which they do in carefully limited amounts. You have to be previous owner of series of lesser ones. You have to be their customer for quite some time, with flawless trail as a stellar customer. You have to have very good relationship with their company (so like Justin Bieber got his car painted on some color that they didn't approve and Ferrari banned him for life). Unique extremely limited series are all this but 10x or 100x, since all know this is darn good investment right out of gate, if you don't screw up maintenance (and at those price levels nobody sane does that). Those are basically not driven, each km would be ridiculously costly in total costs and depreciation. You can skip most of this if you buy second hand, for adequate inflated prices. This won't work for Bieber style of situation of course. reply theluketaylor 4 hours agorootparentFerrari broke their model this cycle. Their high end customers have put up with this for decades since the hypercars always gain value. Most people let them gather dust for a while, then sell them for a tidy profit once the Ferrari quiet embargo on aftermarket sales goes away. This time they got really greedy and tried to insert a limited production mid-engine model into the middle, under the La Ferrari hypercar but above the 'base' mid engine car they have been making forever. The problem is that SF90 isn't special enough. It's the same basic technology as the much cheaper 296 (which is plenty fast and special) and no SF90 has re-sold for above or even that close to MSRP. All the special customers have taken a bath on SF90 and I hear are pretty annoyed with Ferrari. They also tried to toss in the SP line of cars, further diluting the special, limited nature of the hypercars. reply 331c8c71 10 hours agorootparentprevFascinating, thank you. What staggers me is how the very well-off people who can afford the Ferraris put up with this nonsense. In my book the whole point of being rich is the increased freedom which surely includes not complying to idiotic requirements (and I don't mean the social and legal norms here). I guess an urge for status signalling is very hard to resist. reply technothrasher 7 hours agorootparentHaving dipped my toes in the Ferrari world, there are three very different groups of Ferrari buyers- Status people, car people, and super rich people. The status people play the silly game with the dealers. The car people buy used from the status people after the new model isn't flashy any longer. The super rich people buy original era cars (before Fiat bought out the company in the 1970's) and use them as investments. reply rsynnott 6 hours agorootparentprevWell, the main reason that you'd buy a Ferrari in the first place is status signalling, so if it's extra-difficult to get, that makes it _better_ at status signalling. Kind of a variant of a Veblen good; the presence of whatever the special model is in their driveway indicates that the person has completed the rich-person equivalent of throwing a ring into Mount Doom, so is impressive to people who are impressed by that sort of thing. reply jajko 6 hours agorootparentWell, I've driven one basic (458) on a track circuit and let me tell you... If TCO would be below 1% of my net worth, I would buy it in an instant. It literally puts a smile on your face. And its a marvel in engineering compared to cars for regular Joes. But completely useless in regular traffic, in fact much much worse than normal cars. And all kinds of idiots want to semi-constantly race you. So sort of great deal on the paper, actual reality not so much. reply gambiting 2 hours agorootparentNot a ferrari, but I had a Mercedes AMG for a few years and it was exactly like that too - put a stupid grin on my face on the track or on the autobahn(5am drive at solid 160mph for like 30 minutes near berlin will always remain my favourite driving experience), but day to day it was awful - loud, uncomfortable, ruinous on fuel, and people wanted to race you constantly, every now and then people wanted to take pictures as well etc - which I imagine with a Ferrari it's even worse. Nowadays I settled for a completely inconspicious family car that no one would even look at twice, but which still has enough power to go fast if I want to.

When I see product priced just for being status symbol my first reaction is - fuck off, go find yourself some suckers. reply crote 1 hour agorootparentIt's such a weird market segment to me. Sure, they are obviously very high-quality products, but they are clearly not worth the money you are paying for them. You're very obviously paying primarily for the opportunity to brag that you've got a \"genuine Birkin\". It's like those silly restaurants putting gold flakes on food: you can't taste or smell it, so you're paying solely for the opportunity to be ripped off. If you've got money to burn, why not get a fully-custom product made exactly to your wishes by a local atelier and end up with a far superior product for the same price? What's the point if you can't even fully enjoy the fruits of your labor? reply cletus 20 hours agorootparentprevI don't know anything about the secondary market for Hermes bags but it seems like it's pretty healthy. But watches from certain brands (and certain models) can be sold immediately for a profit. For example, a Rolex steel Daytona retails for $14k from an MSRP. You'll sell it in a heartbeat on the secondary market for $30k. The Rainbow Daytona a handful of years ago was $100-150k IIRC. It's now closer to $500-600k. The market is off its peak of 2021-2022 quite a bit but I've bought several luxury watches that could be sold for a healthy profit if I was so inclined. reply TheRoque 20 hours agorootparentWhat makes some of these products go crazy heights, while (I guess that) some other just lose value or never gain value ? Are those products better than others or is it just some pure coincidental mix of factors ? reply cletus 20 hours agorootparentIt's really difficult to predict and has to be managed well by the company. But a big one is when a model gets discontinued because at that point no more will be made so supply is fixed. So the current generation of professional (ie steel) Daytonas have a ceramic bezel. This is to avoid scratches but means they can shatter with enough force. The ceramic itself is baked in a plasma furnace. The tech behind these things can actually be really cool. So Daytonas have historically sold above MSRP on the secondary market but not by this much. About 10 years ago the new ceramic Daytonas were released and what happened was a lot of people sold their previous DAytonas to \"upgrade\". This meant that what was 6 months earlier a $13k MSRP watch was selling for $10-11k and that seemed crazy to me given it was now discontinued so I bought one. At the peak of the market, that watch would sell for $30-35k. Now it's probably under $25k but that's still a good investment. But steel Rolexes never really appreciate that much because the volumes ard really high. You're not going to get rich buying a steel Submariner. There's simply too many of them out there. But one exception is the really vintage Daytonas, particularly what are called Paul Newman Daytonas [1]. These were watches that back in the 1980s sat in a display case for years (at $500 or less) because no one bought them but an association with Paul Newman skyrocketed them in the public consciousness to the point that a 1960s era Paul Newman Daytona in mint condition can easily be worth $500k-$1m+. The market dynamics are really fascinating but it's now become essentially impossible buy an in-demand watch from an AD unless you're a big spender on other products there (they're all typically jewelers as well). The history of Rolex was in utility not luxury (eg the GMT was invented for Pan Am pilots who suddenly were flying cross-country, the Submariner is a dive watch, the Daytona was originally for racing drivers, etc).

Here it is, I will actually and finally explain the economics of a Birkin handbag. It is all about convincing the buyer to consider a consumer good to be an investment. People treat consumer goods and investments very differently mentally and rightfully so. A consumer good is something you use for you own enjoyment or necessity. An investment is something that is supposed to pay you back more in the future. You do not get to use or enjoy the stocks and treasuries in your investment account. But you do hope that they will bring you more money in the future. So what if consumer good can also be an investment? It seems like a great deal. First of all you get to enjoy it. If you are woman (or a man that likes to wear handbags, I guess) you can walk around with your Birkin bag and show it off while it appreciates. Stocks and bonds are the often recommended investments, but you need a large and complex political system to ensure your stocks and bonds are worth the money. They are after all just pieces of paper (and nowadays you usually do not even get to hold the paper yourself), but to get these pieces of paper to convert to ownership rights of large enterprises you need, as I said a large and complex political and legal system. A Birkin bag on the other hand, is something you can keep close to you. In your closet. So the sales potential of something that is both a consumer good and an investment is great. Hermes saw this potential and decided to make the Birkin that thing. If the Birkin can be sold for more in the secondary market than what it sells for in store, it becomes an investment all of a sudden. And then you get all kinds of new demand. So Hermes made that happen by good marketing and (probably) by buying out Birkins in the secondary market. But that is also a very unstable situation. If you can just buy a Birkin in a store and then turn around and sell it immediately for a profit, everyone would do that and the secondary market price would collapse. And that is where the exclusivity comes in. The plan for Hermes is that they would only sell Birkins to rich people that do not need to resell their bags in the secondary market even if there is a profit. Thus, the ideal client is a woman that feels good that her Birkin investment is appreciating in value but has absolutely no desire to sell it because she does not need the money and she loves her bag. She just likes to consider how much money she is making in her mental profit and loss statement by keeping her bag, while continuing to wear and use it. So that is why sales of new Birkins are so restricted and are based on a personal relationship between a salesperson and a client. The salesperson judges the client on whether they are the type of client that will turn around and flip the bag. And meanwhile the company, Hermes, judges the salesperson on whether they can keep their clients in check. Of course some bags get flipped, and that is necessary to keep a resale market going, and thus to keep up the evidence of higher resale values. But it is important to keep the flips to a very small number. It is a very clever system, but it was not invented by Hermes. It has been tried before with art, fine wine and ferraris. And for those of you that might think that the Birkin madness is somehow related to women's lack of financial sense, keep in mind that Ferrari was doing the same thing with limited addition Ferraris marketed mostly to men long before Hermes hit upon their Birkin scam. The problem, from the point of view of the consumer, is that it is a very unstable system. It seems great and safe to have your investment in your closet, but keep in mind that the value of that investment is being kept alive by Hermes doing hard work and spending a lot of money to keep up the secondary market for Birkins. If Hermes changes strategy or some new CEO makes some mistake, then the value of your Birkin will disappear in a second and you will have no legal recourse. If the fashion changes, the value of your bag may plummet even if Hermes does their very best to do everything right. Etc. So my recommendation for someone considering a Birkin or another consumer good/investment combo is to stick to actual investments for investing and to actual consumer goods for consuming. An asset that produces value (such as stock in a good company) is a naturally appreciating investment (as it produces value) and it does not need to have some kind alternative reality created around it by a corporation in order to appreciate. Of course one has also to make sure he/she is a good citizen and exercises their responsibilities to keeping up their nation as a stable democracy with a stable well functioning legal system and well established property rights. reply dboreham 4 hours agoparentSee also: guitars.
