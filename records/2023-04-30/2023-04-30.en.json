The thread includes hilarious stories of embarrassing mistakes, the misuse of commands, and reactions from system administrators. There is also a discussion about shortcomings of Unix terminal subsystem and features of chat programs from previous decades. Overall, the thread is a lighthearted and entertaining read with some technical insights.A thread on Hacker News contains stories from users about being reprimanded by systems administrators and encountering early security issues in school labs. One user wrote that they mistakenly attempted to su into every single system account on an AT&T Unix SVR3 3B2 cluster in college, while another discovered a concealed read-only network share containing private data of applicants while in school a decade later. A third user created a script using a spellchecker that demonstrated a na\u00efve dictionary attack. Overall, these stories reveal the importance of enforcing strong security measures in computer labs, even within educational contexts.Comments on a Github commit about sudo reveal tangents about various tech topics from Unix to social media behavior. However, some comments still focus on the sudo issue and clarify that the message isn't entirely gone, just updated for mailer configurations. The comments also highlight how much the world of technology has changed since the era of multi-user machines with unprivileged shell accounts. While the discussion contains many digressions, the core takeaway is about how the sudo incident reporting feature is still present but only displayed if it\u2019s configured to be sent in the mail.Sudo has attracted criticism for a user notification that suggests errors may be reported to software companies, leading one commenter to describe it as an example of the \"opposite of how [people] are supposed to feel when using free software\". Suggestions for the notification included simply informing users that an attempt has been made, while\u00a0others said the warnings were needed to scare novice users off using the tool. One commentator\u00a0described receiving an email from an empathetic system admin\u00a0after inadvertently breaking a command. While agreeing the warning message needed updating, several individuals shared amusing stories about\u00a0similarly opaque tech error messages, including Windows 95's notorious \"an illegal operation has occurred\" alert.\nThe sudo command's \"This incident will be reported\" message has been removed in a recent update. The decision to remove the message was made because it was unnecessary and potentially confusing to users. The warning email is configurable and might not be accurate. Some users use the message as a debugging tool to detect misconfigured sudoers files. The commit message mentions the xkcd comic (https://xkcd.com/838/) about the message, which points out that no one is checking reports generated by sudo. Many developers are concerned about the lack of tests that cover such critical infrastructure, as well as the disregard for security that led to the removal of the message. Some users still find the message amusing, and it has become an iconic part of the command's output.",

    "hn_content": "SpaceX's Starlink satellite coverage map is now live, showing the current location of the recently launched satellites. The satellites are much smaller in reality than they appear on the map, which exaggerates their size thousands of times to show their position. Space is three-dimensional, and while it's true that the satellites are very small compared to the potential falling area, they still present risks, and the likelihood of collision is higher than one would expect based on their number density. However, SpaceX aims to resolve this issue by controlling the position of the satellites so that they don't need to avoid other Starlink satellites in orbital operation. The satellites are expected to control their descent before they fall to Earth, and even if this doesn't happen, a collision between two satellites in circular orbits cannot throw debris into much longer-lasting orbits due to how orbital mechanics work.Several startups are filing to launch their own 10,000+ satellites to provide global internet connectivity. The development of megaconstellations was made possible due to incumbent telecoms refusing to develop infrastructure everywhere it's needed, hence creating a vacuum. To curb megaconstellations, telecoms need to be stripped of their monopolist powers, and fiber infrastructure needs to be mandated. The constellations will be canceled and decommissioned this way. The ability to observe the universe can be maintained by placing more Hubbles or James Webbs outside the Earth's atmosphere. Billionaires who are launching these satellites are being permitted without communal discussion or decision to expunge a real night sky we've had for millennia. Starlink coverage maps and the orbital chart can be accessed at https://starlink.sx/. Starlink has created a significant improvement in rural areas as more satellites are launched, but the service has even become unusable in cities due to network and land stations bottlenecks.SpaceX has launched over 4,000 satellites as part of its Starlink mission, which plans to offer global, affordable internet access. The company has requested approval for up to 42,000 satellites, with several thousand in orbit already. While Starlink offers new opportunities for remote areas with limited internet access, the service has faced criticism over the potential environmental impact of so many satellites in orbit. Additionally, users have reported connectivity issues and concerns over the high cost of the service. SpaceX has aimed to address these issues by launching newer satellites with improved technology and lowering costs, but it remains to be seen if Starlink will become a mainstream internet option for users around the world.SpaceX's Starlink has been offering service in most of Sweden for some time now, despite a coverage map indicating otherwise. GPS satellites are placed in 12-hour orbits optimized for the number of satellites needed to cover the Earth and the need to have at least four satellites visible at the same time from any given location. GPS satellites carry atomic clocks and are placed in orbits below geostationary so that they move slowly and their Doppler effect changes relatively slowly during the PN code acquisition phase. A Quasi-Zenith Satellite System is necessary for global coverage for satellites in a GEO height orbit. Starlink is already available where broadband sometimes isn't. Starlink's current implementation of the network requires the satellite to see both the user and a ground station at the same time. The newer satellites have satellite-to-satellite laser links that can form a chain until they reach a satellite that is presently overhead of an Earth station. Satellites with polar coverage require ones that move north to south from pole to pole.SpaceX's Starlink satellite network offers internet access through a global mesh of communication satellites. Currently, the network has a shell of satellites in polar orbits to provide polar coverage for the military. Though the commercial market for polar internet access is minimal, Starlink offers coverage in Alaska through a limited number of near-polar orbit satellites. The company offers high-speed internet and low latency, attracting consumers who lack alternatives capable of supporting services like Teams calls. Although competitors like OneWeb exist, Starlink holds a lead, and customers can pay a premium for publically addressable features like an IPv4 address. The company plans to add more satellites and offer IPv6 support soon. While the network serves a functional purpose, critics express concerns over the amount of debris in orbit.",

    "hn_content": "A 2012 study found that children aged 2-6 can be trained to acquire perfect pitch. The article sparks a discussion on the HN forum about the nature of perfect pitch and pitch memory. Perfect pitch is the ability to recognize any musical note and reproduce it on demand. Some people claim that perfect pitch is not binary and that relative pitch is more common. Relative pitch is the ability to recognize musical notes in relation to other notes. Many musicians claim that perfect pitch is not necessary for success in the music industry.Perfect pitch can be useful for musicians, educators, and composers in various ways, including improving accuracy in performance, music education, enhancing creativity in composition, facilitating communication among musicians, and improving the ability to transcribe music. There are tools available to practice perfect pitch. Mozart and Ella Fitzgerald had absolute pitch, but its usefulness is debatable. The University of Chicago's study confirms that acquired absolute pitch is not as accurate as \"true\" perfect pitch. Relative pitch is equally essential, and intonation is equally easy/hard for both absolute and relative ears. Conductors frequently have perfect pitch, and singers, musicians playing stringed instruments, and trombone players benefit from it. People speaking tonal languages like Mandarin develop perfect pitch more often. Choral singers with perfect pitch sometimes have a hard time retuning. People lose perfect pitch at around 50-60 years old.The post discusses the misconceptions and advantages/disadvantages of perfect pitch in musicians. \n\nThe concept of pitch is flawed and not perfect, and standardization has led to not only a subjective idea of pitch, but also the loss of the ability to deal with varying pitch and musical temperament. \n\nRelative pitch is more essential and important for a musician's ability to sight sing, play in tune with others, and work in varying pitch situations. \n\nThere is not much practical difference between a professionally trained musician with perfect pitch and one without, as long as the latter has been provided with a reference tone. \n\nPerfect pitch is a learned skill but can be a curse for musicians, with disadvantages such as losing it with age and difficulty in transposing instruments. \n\nThe name \"perfect pitch\" is a misnomer, and the frequencies that note names refer to are a social construct that has shifted over time. \n\nThere are rare hearing disorders such as Diplacusis or Polyacusis that can cause a person to hear additional erroneous pitches.The comments section comprises various discussions ranging from sound sensitivities, the concept of absolute pitch and relative pitch to perfect pitch, and musical skills. The discussion on sound sensitivities reveals how some people can feel stressed in a quiet environment when others experience ambient sound environment. The debate on perfect pitch reveals that having perfect pitch is not necessary to be a good musician, as it is a simplification, and people have varying abilities to recognize notes relative to a reference. The discussion also highlights the challenges that arise when transposing music in real-time with perfect pitch, and how relative pitch can come in handy in learning and identifying notes.The post discusses perfect pitch, the ability to recognize a specific note or chord without reference, and its uses in various musical contexts. Some people find it helpful for composition and transcription, while others argue that good relative pitch is more useful. Perfect pitch can make it difficult to play out-of-tune instruments or tolerate poorly tuned recordings. A technique called the Eguchi method, which uses color association to teach chord recognition, is mentioned. Some people argue that anyone can learn perfect pitch, but it is not widely taught. Furthermore, the post explores other types of exceptional memory, such as color memory, and contrasts the benefits and drawbacks of different kinds of musical perception.Parents can potentially help their children learn perfect pitch by exposing them to complex music like classical and jazz during peak sound processing mode (infancy and toddlerhood), but it is not guaranteed to work for every child. Some adults also have the ability to develop pitch memory, but it may not be perfect or may dissipate with age. Perfect pitch may be a burden for some people and can shift over time. A musical teaching method for developing perfect pitch has been around since at least 1991, and involves Flashcards with audio prompts. Perfect pitch is not necessarily related to external reference frequencies and can be trained using software or electronic frequency counters.",

Others argue that some longer videos require more exploration and nuance than bullet points can provide, and that shorter videos with more fluff are a result of pressure to meet platform requirements for watch time. Some argue in support of hobbyist content creators while others point out that many popular YouTubers have grown into large teams to produce high-quality content. The discussion touches on issues of creator compensation, the balance of entertainment versus educational content, and the use of ad-blockers.Users commentate on the ethics of blocking ads on YouTube videos, with some arguing that users should either pay with their time by watching ads or boycott content they disagree with, rather than depriving the creator of revenue. Others argue that ads and lengthy videos with low signal-to-noise ratios are a cultural abomination, and that people have a right to control what content they engage with. Users also criticize YouTube for setting up a system of making money based on a theoretical consumer model, and suggest that paywalls for quality content may be more honest than advertising or subscription models. Many users express disdain for the monetization of content, with some suggesting that creator revenue should come from alternate sources.Users debate YouTube content and ads, with some suggesting a return to amateur-based videos and others insisting professionals are necessary.

A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine led by John W. Ayers, Ph.D., from the Qualcomm Institute at University of California San Diego provides an early glimpse into the role that AI assistants could play in medicine. The study compared written responses from physicians and those from ChatGPT to real-world health questions. A panel of licensed healthcare professionals preferred ChatGPT\u2019s responses 79% of the time and rated ChatGPT\u2019s responses as higher quality and more empathetic. \u201cThe opportunities for improving healthcare with AI are massive,\u201d said Ayers, who is also vice chief of innovation in the UC San Diego School of Medicine Division of Infectious Disease and Global Public Health. \u201cAI-augmented care is the future of medicine.\u201d Is ChatGPT Ready for Healthcare?In the new study, the research team set out to answer the question: Can ChatGPT respond accurately to questions patients send to their doctors? If yes, AI models could be integrated into health systems to improve physician responses to questions sent by patients and ease the ever-increasing burden on physicians.\u201cChatGPT might be able to pass a medical licensing exam,\" said study co-author Davey Smith, M.D., M.A.S., a physician-scientist, co-director of the UC San Diego Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute and professor at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, \u201cbut directly answering patient questions accurately and empathetically is a different ballgame.\u201d \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic accelerated virtual healthcare adoption,\u201d added study co-author Eric Leas, Ph.D., M.P.H., a Qualcomm Institute affiliate and assistant professor in the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science. \u201cWhile this made accessing care easier for patients, physicians are burdened by a barrage of electronic patient messages seeking medical advice that have contributed to record-breaking levels of physician burnout.\u201dDesigning a Study to Test ChatGPT in a Healthcare SettingTo obtain a large and diverse sample of healthcare questions and physician answers that did not contain identifiable personal information, the team turned to social media where millions of patients publicly post medical questions to which doctors respond: Reddit\u2019s AskDocs. r/AskDocs is a subreddit with approximately 452,000 members who post medical questions and verified healthcare professionals submit answers. While anyone can respond to a question, moderators verify healthcare professionals\u2019 credentials and responses display the respondent\u2019s level of credentials. The result is a large and diverse set of patient medical questions and accompanying answers from licensed medical professionals.While some may wonder if question-answer exchanges on social media are a fair test, team members noted that the exchanges were reflective of their clinical experience. The team randomly sampled 195 exchanges from AskDocs where a verified physician responded to a public question. The team provided the original question to ChatGPT and asked it to author a response. A panel of three licensed healthcare professionals assessed each question and the corresponding responses and were blinded to whether the response originated from a physician or ChatGPT. They compared responses based on information quality and empathy, noting which one they preferred.The panel of healthcare professional evaluators preferred ChatGPT responses to physician responses 79% of the time. \u201cChatGPT messages responded with nuanced and accurate information that often addressed more aspects of the patient\u2019s questions than physician responses,\u201d said Jessica Kelley, M.S.N, a nurse practitioner with San Diego firm Human Longevity and study co-author.  Additionally, ChatGPT responses were rated significantly higher in quality than physician responses: good or very good quality responses were 3.6 times higher for ChatGPT than physicians (physicians 22.1% versus ChatGPT 78.5%). The responses were also more empathic: empathetic or very empathetic responses were 9.8 times higher for ChatGPT than for physicians (physicians 4.6% versus ChatGPT 45.1%). \u201cI never imagined saying this,\u201d added Aaron Goodman, M.D., an associate clinical professor at UC San Diego School of Medicine and study coauthor, \u201cbut ChatGPT is a prescription I\u2019d like to give to my inbox. The tool will transform the way I support my patients.\u201dHarnessing AI Assistants for Patient Messages \u201cWhile our study pitted ChatGPT against physicians, the ultimate solution isn\u2019t throwing your doctor out altogether,\u201d said Adam Poliak, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Computer Science at Bryn Mawr College and study co-author. \u201cInstead, a physician harnessing ChatGPT is the answer for better and empathetic care.\u201d\u201cOur study is among the first to show how AI assistants can potentially solve real world healthcare delivery problems,\u201d said Christopher Longhurst, M.D., M.S., Chief Medical Officer and Chief Digital Officer at UC San Diego Health. \u201cThese results suggest that tools like ChatGPT can efficiently draft high quality, personalized medical advice for review by clinicians, and we are beginning that process at UCSD Health.\u201d Mike Hogarth, M.D., a physician-bioinformatician, co-director of the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at UC San Diego, professor in the UC San Diego School of Medicine and study co-author, added, \u201cIt is important that integrating AI assistants into healthcare messaging be done in the context of a randomized controlled trial to judge how the use of AI assistants impact outcomes for both physicians and patients.\u201d In addition to improving workflow, investments into AI assistant messaging could impact patient health and physician performance. Mark Dredze, Ph.D., the John C Malone Associate Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins and study co-author, noted: \u201cWe could use these technologies to train doctors in patient-centered communication, eliminate health disparities suffered by minority populations who often seek healthcare via messaging, build new medical safety systems, and assist doctors by delivering higher quality and more efficient care.\u201d In addition to Ayers, Poliak, Dredze, Leas, Kelley, Goodman, Longhurst, Hogarth and Smith, authors of the JAMA Internal Medicine paper, \u201cComparing Physician and Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Responses to Patient Questions Posted to a Public Social Media Forum\u201d (JAMA Intern Med. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.1838), are Zechariah Zhu, B.S., of UC San Diego and Dr. Dennis J.

However, some commenters pointed out that these physician responses were taken from threads where they were interacting with strangers, not their patients. Additionally, concerns were raised about ChatGPT potentially confirming medical biases and leading to misdiagnosis for hypochondriacs. The discussion also criticized the US healthcare system, the brokenness of insurance, and the need for medical innovation. One commenter claimed to be developing a blockchain-enabled data management system enabled by wearables that linked with ChatGPT and NFTs to create value for underprivileged patients.A commentator discusses the financial aspect of healthcare, stating that FDA-approved equipment is far more expensive than non-FDA-approved, and purchasing equipment to use at home is often cheaper than going to a physician's office for a test. Other users in the comment section discuss their experiences with healthcare in different countries, including Western Europe and Canada. Some criticize healthcare in the US, while others dispute negative claims made about medical facilities in the US. Healthcare advertisements, especially for pharmaceuticals, are mostly forbidden in Western Europe, while they are common in US waiting rooms.Users on an internet forum, including doctors, provide unreliable and unverified data for medical AI ChatGPT to learn from. ChatGPT may also lack empathy and context-based understanding important in medical diagnoses, leading to potentially dangerous diagnoses. However, some users have reported success in using ChatGPT for coding and generating effective code with best practices in mind. There are concerns that articles about ChatGPT may exaggerate its abilities, leading to misconceptions about the effectiveness of AI in medicine. Ultimately, the efficacy and reliability of ChatGPT remain unverified and may not be as competent as human doctors in medical diagnoses.The discussion centers around the use of natural language processing (NLP) for generating responses to questions in different domains, particularly in healthcare. The comments include tips for improving the use of NLP models, acknowledging the need for skill, tuning, and learning by trial and error. The need for effective prompts that generate good results is highlighted, but the challenge is mentioned in differentiating between cherry-picked results and realistic ones. The comments present a mixed opinion on the effectiveness of NLP models, with some praising them as useful for basic tasks and others offering criticisms about the limitations and overhyped claims. The need for domain experts and regulatory frameworks in developing effective NLP models is emphasized.The post discusses the progression of AI-generated images from GAN faces to photorealistic images created by Stable Diffusion models. The conversation highlights the significance of advancements in AI-generated images and how they impact the art industry. The authors debate the reliability and user-friendliness of Stable Diffusion models. They also argue that creating photorealistic images requires extensive fine-tuning of the model and prompt engineering. The article further highlights the significance of models like StyleGAN3 and the limitations of GPT-4. The commenters discuss the practicality of drawing versus relying on AI-generated images and agree that drawing is an essential skill for any visual artist.Users discuss the limitations and applications of LLM chat tools like ChatGPT, highlighting the importance of well-structured prompts, limitations for generating code, and the need for users to understand the tool's limitations, even as it is useful for select verifiable tasks. Some users confirm the tool's usefulness in generating content and providing a productivity gain, but others warn against overestimating its capabilities or relying too heavily on its output. Some users compare ChatGPT's usefulness to Google, which some find less effective than before.ChatGPT, a language model that uses artificial intelligence, is useful for generating code and providing explanations to basic questions, but not for complex queries. Users should be aware of its limitations and potential inaccuracies. Its use for generating recipes and code prototypes can increase productivity, and it can ask follow-up questions to clarify user needs. However, it may hallucinate or provide incorrect information, especially regarding statistics or specifications. Users should be cautious and fact-check results. The use of ChatGPT has generated mixed reactions, with some finding it helpful and others preferring traditional search engines or human interaction. Its effectiveness depends on the user's needs and expectations.- ChatGPT is an AI language model that can generate responses to prompts.\n- Some users have had positive experiences with ChatGPT's output, especially in coding tasks.\n- However, others have criticized its limitations and errors, especially when asked to provide expert advice or generate complex responses.\n- The study mentioned in the comments compared ChatGPT's responses to Reddit comments from physicians, but did not evaluate their accuracy.\n- The limitations of the study, as well as the potential for bias and over-reliance on ChatGPT, raise questions about its usefulness in real-world scenarios.",

    "content": "Testing BlogSensenmann: Code Deletion at ScaleFriday, April 28, 2023By Phil NormanCode at ScaleAt Google, tens of thousands of software engineers contribute to a multi-billion-line mono-repository. This repository, stored in a system called Piper, contains the source code of shared libraries, production services, experimental programs, diagnostic and debugging tools: basically anything that's code-related.This open approach can be very powerful. For example, if an engineer is unsure how to use a library, they can find examples just by searching. It also allows kind-hearted individuals to perform important updates across the whole repository, be that migrating to newer APIs, or following language developments such as Python 3, or Go generics.Code, however, doesn't come for free: it's expensive to produce, but also costs real engineering time to maintain. Such maintenance cannot easily be skipped, at least if one wants to avoid larger costs later on.But what if there were less code to maintain? Are all those lines of code really necessary?Deletion at ScaleAny large project accumulates dead code: there's always some module that is no longer needed, or a program that was used during early development but hasn't been run in years. Indeed, entire projects are created, function for a time, and then stop being useful. Sometimes they are cleaned up, but cleanups require time and effort, and it's not always easy to justify the investment.However, while this dead code sits around undeleted, it's still incurring a cost: the automated testing system doesn't know it should stop running dead tests; people running large-scale cleanups aren't aware that there's no point migrating this code, as it is never run anyway.So what if we could clean up dead code automatically? That was exactly what people started thinking several years ago, during the Z\u00fcrich Engineering Productivity team's annual hackathon. The Sensenmann project, named after the German word for the embodiment of Death, has been highly successful. It submits over 1000 deletion changelists per week, and has so far deleted nearly 5% of all C++ at Google.Its goal is simple (at least, in principle): automatically identify dead code, and send code review requests ('changelists') to delete it.What to Delete?Google's build system, Blaze (the internal version of Bazel) helps us determine this: by representing dependencies between binary targets, libraries, tests, source files and more, in a consistent and accessible way, we're able to construct a dependency graph. This allows us to find libraries that are not linked into any binary, and propose their deletion.That's only a small part of the problem, though: what about all those binaries? All the one-shot data migration programs, and diagnostic tools for deprecated systems? If they don't get removed, all the libraries they depend on will be kept around too.The only real way to know if programs are useful is to check whether they're being run, so for internal binaries (programs run in Google's data centres, or on employee workstations), a log entry is written when a program runs, recording the time and which specific binary it is. By aggregating this, we get a liveness signal for every binary used in Google. If a program hasn't been used for a long time, we try sending a deletion changelist.What Not to Delete?There are, of course, exceptions: some program code is there simply to serve as an example of how to use an API; some programs run only in places we can't get a log signal from. There are many other exceptions too, where removing the code would be deleterious. For this reason, it's important to have a blocklisting system so that exceptions can be marked, and we can avoid bothering people with spurious changelists.The Devel's in the DetailsConsider a simple case. We have two binaries, each depending on its own library, and also on a third, shared library. Drawing this (ignoring the source files and other dependencies), we find this kind of structure:If we see that main1 is in active use, but main2 was last used over a year ago, we can propagate the liveness signal through the build tree, marking main1 as alive along with everything it depends upon. What is left can be removed; as main2 depends on lib2, we want to delete these two targets in the same change:So far so good, but real production code has unit tests, whose build targets depend upon the libraries they test. This immediately makes the graph traversal a lot more complicated:The testing infrastructure is going to run all those tests, including lib2_test, despite lib2 never being executed 'for real'. This means we cannot use test runs as a 'liveness' signal: if we did, we'd consider lib2_test to be alive, which would keep lib2 around forever. We would only be able to clean up untested code, which would severely hamper our efforts.What we really want is for each test to share the fate of the library it is testing. We can do this by making the library and its test interdependent, thus creating loops in the graph:This turns each library and its test into a strongly connected component. We can use the same technique as before, marking the 'live' nodes and then hunting for collections of 'dead' nodes to be deleted, but this time using Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm to deal with the loops.Simple, right? Well, yes, if it's easy to identify the relationships between tests and the libraries they're testing. Sadly, that is not always the case. In the examples above, there's a simple naming convention which allows us to match tests to libraries, but we can't rely on that heuristic in general.Consider the following two cases:On the left, we have an implementation of the LZW compression algorithm, as separate compressor and decompressor libraries. The test is actually testing both of them, to ensure data isn't corrupted after being compressed and then decompressed. On the right, we have a web_test that is testing our web server library; it uses a URL encoder library for support, but isn't actually testing the URL encoder itself. On the left, we want to consider the LZW test and both LZW libraries as one connected component, but on the right, we'd want to exclude the URL encoder and consider web_test and web_lib as the connected component.Despite requiring different treatment, these two cases have identical structures. In practice, we can encourage engineers to mark libraries like url_encoder_lib as being 'test only' (ie. only for use to support unit testing), which can help in the web-test case; otherwise our current approach is to use the edit distance between test and library names to pick the most likely library to match to a given test. Being able to identify cases like the LZW example, with one test and two libraries, is likely to involve processing test coverage data, and has not yet been explored.Focus on the User...While the ultimate beneficiaries of dead code deletion are the software engineers themselves, many of whom appreciate the help in keeping their projects tidy, not everyone is happy to receive automated changelists trying to delete code they wrote. This is where the social engineering side of the project comes in, which is every bit as important as the software engineering.Automatic code deletion is an alien concept to many engineers, and just as with the introduction of unit testing 20 years ago, many are resistent to it. It takes time and effort to change people's minds, along with a good deal of careful communication.There are three main parts to Sensenmann's communication strategy. Of primary importance are the change descriptions, as they are the first thing a reviewer will see. They must be concise, but must provide enough background for all reviewers to be able to make a judgement. This is a difficult balance to achieve: too short, and many people will fail to find the information they need; too long, and one ends up with a wall of text no one will bother to read. Well-labelled links to supporting documentation and FAQs can really help here.The second part is the supporting documentation. Concise and clear wording is vital here, too, as is a good navigable structure. Different people will need different information: some need reassurance that in a source control system, deletions can be rolled back; some will need guidance in how best to deal with a bad change, for example by fixing a misuse of the build system. Through careful thought, and iterations of user feedback, the supporting documentation can become a useful resource.The third part is dealing with user feedback. This can be the hardest part at times: feedback is more frequently negative than positive, and can require a cool head and a good deal of diplomacy at times. However, accepting such feedback is the best way to improve the system in general, make users happier, and thus avoid negative feedback in the future.Onwards and UpwardsAutomatically deleting code may sound like a strange idea: code is expensive to write, and is generally considered to be an asset. However, unused code costs time and effort, whether in maintaining it, or cleaning it up. Once a code base reaches a certain size, it starts to make real sense to invest engineering time in automating the clean-up process. At Google's scale, it is estimated that automatic code deletion has paid for itself tens of times over, in saved maintenance costs.The implementation requires solutions to problems both technical and social in nature. While a lot of progress has been made in both these areas, they are not entirely solved yet. As improvements are made, though, the rate of acceptance of the deletions increases and automatic deletion becomes more and more impactful. This kind of investment will not make sense everywhere, but if you have a huge mono-repository, maybe it'd make sense for you too. At least at Google, reducing the C++ maintenance burden by 5% is a huge win.Labels: automation , dead code , Phil NormanNo comments :Post a CommentThe comments you read and contribute here belong only to the person who posted them.

    "hn_content": "An internal team at Google built a script to identify dead code on an internal system through HTTP access log analysis to delete unused or rarely used endpoints. A caution against using this method is not to delete stuff critical in rare cases since users may not discover errors. The team plans to use a script to confirm usage for items with zero usage detected by the access logs script. Sensenmann is an internal joke at Google for German-speaking teams to use German-named projects, and it is German for \"scythe man.\" Some consider it net beneficial to remove unused code, even if it temporarily breaks something for a while. Lastly, Google's monorepo saves the full history and version control based on an always-increasing, globally shared commit number.Management of old and unused code is a significant problem for many companies. Google has developed an automated tool called \"Sensenmann\" that detects unused code and recommends deletion. Sensenmann uses a \"monorepo,\" a single repository for all Google source code, to identify unused code by analyzing build targets. If a code has no callers and has not been built into a binary for six months, it is a candidate for deletion. However, Google still relies on humans to make the final decision before deleting identified code. The system has limitations, and users might have to adopt the entire Google stack to make use of it if it were open-sourced.Google's monorepo and automated dead code deletion process is a novel and interesting approach to scaling up industry best practices. The monorepo allows for easier discoverability and automated deletion prevents unused code from taking up resources. Deleting dead code is a complicated process, and the blog post goes into detail about the challenges and benefits of automated deletion. While deleting code may seem trivial, the scale at which Google operates makes it crucial to have automated processes in place. Google's approach is a reminder of the importance of efficient code management at all levels.No meaningful content to provide a summary.",

    "hn_content": "MRSK is a deployment tool that offers developers an alternative to Kubernetes. Users appreciate the tool's ease of use, lack of vendor lock-in, and freedom to deploy web apps anywhere, even on bare-metal. However, some users point out that using vendor-specific offerings is necessary for heavily regulated industries. MRSK appeals to users who prefer to lean toward simplicity and who don't want to spend development time avoiding vendor lock-in. On the other hand, some users criticize MRSK's lack of features, such as partitioning bare-metal into VMs. Some also prefer Kubernetes because of its well-established ecosystem for observability, workload scaling, database management, and multi-datacenter service networking.- Managed Kubernetes (k8s) can be helpful for stateful applications like databases and complex networking\n- Many companies, such as Zalando and Akamai, are running DBs in Kubernetes\n- MRSK is a bare-metal deployment tool designed by 37signals for their own server management needs\n- MRSK is not recommended for cloud deployments and falls short in handling cloud-native load balancers and persistent storage requirements\n- Traefik is an excellent proxy with powerful integrations, though it may be more resource-intensive compared to other reverse proxies like Nginx or Caddy\n- MRKS is specifically designed for deployments on bare metal servers and is not suitable for containerized environments like Docker or Podman. \n- The name \"MRSK\" might face a legal challenge from Maersk.\n- Tilix changed its name from Terminix due to trademark issues.\n- A user asked for a tool similar to Tilix for deploying a small dockerized app to a cheap VM with declarative deploy, without using K8s. Another user recommended shipping the local docker context to the remote host and running Docker commands there instead.\n- A user asked for a guide to using Docker Compose to deploy a Dockerized Node.js app. Another user replied that the readme guide was sufficient for their needs.\n- A user asked how to put a load balancer in front of the deployed servers. Two users recommended using any decent load balancer or updating the configuration in the LB when bringing a new origin online.\n- One user expressed confusion regarding the command \"gem install mrsk,\" while another user provided a one-liner to use it via Docker on the readme.",
