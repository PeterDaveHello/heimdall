    "originBody": "PRODUCT COMPANY CAREERS 2 PODCASTS BLOG CONTACT SALES BACK COMPANY 26 OCT 2023 The Cloud Computer Bryan Cantrill CTO Today we are announcing the general availability of the world’s first commercial cloud computer — along with our $44M Series A financing. From the outset at Oxide, and as I outlined in my 2020 Stanford talk, we have had three core beliefs as a company: Cloud computing is the future of all computing infrastructure. The computer that runs the cloud should be able to be purchased and not merely rented. Building a cloud computer necessitates a rack-level approach — and the co-design of both hardware and software. Of these beliefs, the first is not at all controversial: the agility, flexibility, and scalability of cloud computing have been indisputably essential for many of the services that we depend on in the modern economy. The degree that the second belief is controversial, however, depends on who you are: for those that are already running on premises due to security, regulatory, economic, or latency reasons, it is self-evident that computers should be able to be purchased and not merely rented. But to others, this has been more of a revelation — and since we started Oxide, we have found more and more people realize that the rental-only model for the cloud is not sustainable. Friends love to tag us on links to VC thinkpieces, CTO rants, or analyst reports on industry trends — and we love people thinking of us, of course (even when being tagged for the dozenth time!) — but the only surprise is how surprising it continues to be for some folks. The third belief — that the development of a cloud computer necessitates rack-scale design of both hardware and software — may seem iconoclastic to those who think only in terms of software, but it is in fact not controversial among technologists: as computing pioneer Alan Kay famously observed, \"people who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.\" This is especially true in cloud computing, where the large public cloud companies have long ago come to the conclusion that they needed to be designing their own holistic systems. But if this isn’t controversial, why hasn’t there been a cloud computer before Oxide’s? First, because it’s big: to meaningfully build a cloud computer, one must break out of the shackles of the 1U or 2U server, and really think about the rack as the unit of design. Second, it hasn’t been done because it’s hard: co-designing hardware and software that spans compute, networking, and storage requires building an extraordinary team across disparate disciplines, coupling deep expertise with a strong sense of versatility, teamwork, and empathy. And the team isn’t enough by itself: it also needs courage, resilience, and (especially) time. So the biggest question when we set out was not \"is the market there?\" or \"is this the right way to do it?\", but rather could we pull this off? Pulling it off We have indeed pulled it off — and it’s been a wild ride! While we have talked about the trek quite a bit on our podcast, Oxide and Friends (and specifically, Steve and I recently answered questions about the rack), our general availability is a good opportunity to reflect on some of the first impressions that the Oxide cloud computer has made upon those who have seen it. \"Where are all the boxes?\" The traditional rack-and-stack approach starts with a sea of boxes arriving with servers, racks, cabling, etc. This amounts to a literal kit car approach — and it starts with tedious, dusty, de-boxing. But the Oxide rack ships with everything installed and comes in just one box — a crate that is its own feat of engineering. All of this serves to dramatically reduce the latency from equipment arrival to power on and first provision — from weeks and months to days or even hours. \"Is it on?\" We knew at the outset that rack-level design would afford us the ability to change the geometry of compute sleds — that we would get higher density in the rack by trading horizontal real estate for vertical. We knew, too, that we were choosing to use 80mm fans for their ability to move more air much more efficiently — so much so that we leveraged our approach to the supply chain to partner with Sanyo Denki (our fan provider) to lower the minimum speed of the fans from 5K RPM to the 2K RPM that we needed. But adding it up, the Oxide rack has a surprising aesthetic attribute: it is whisper quiet. To those accustomed to screaming servers, this is so unexpected that when we were getting FCC compliance, the engineer running the test sheepishly asked us if we were sure the rack was on — when it was dissipating 15 kW! That the rack is quiet wasn’t really deliberate (and we are frankly much more interested in the often hidden power draw that blaring fan noise represents), but it does viscerally embody much of the Oxide differentiation with respect to both rack-level design and approach to the supply chain. \"Where are the cables?\" Anyone accustomed to a datacenter will note the missing mass of cold-aisle cabling that one typically sees at the front of a rack. But moving to the back of the rack reveals only a DC busbar and a tight, cabled backplane. This represents one of the bigger bets we made: we blindmated networking. This was mechanically tricky, but the payoff is huge: capacity can be added to the Oxide cloud computer simply by snapping in a new compute sled — nothing to be cabled whatsoever! This is a domain in which we have leapfrogged the hyperscalers, who (for their own legacy reasons) don’t do it this way. This can be jarring to veteran technologists. As one exclaimed upon seeing the rack last week, \"I am both surprised and delighted!\" (Or rather: a very profane variant of that sentiment.) \"You did your own switch too?!\" When we first started the company, one of our biggest technical quandaries was what to do about the switch. At some level, both paths seemed untenable: we knew from our own experience that integrating with third-party switches would lead to exactly the kind of integration pain for customers that we sought to alleviate — but it also seemed outrageously ambitious to do our own switch in addition to everything else we were doing. But as we have many times over the course of Oxide, we opted for the steeper path in the name of saving our customers grief, choosing to build our own switch. If it has to be said, getting it working isn’t easy! And of course, building the switch is insufficient: we also needed to build our own networking software — to say nothing of the management network required to be able to manage compute sleds when they’re powered off. \"Wait, that’s part of it?!\" It’s one thing to say that all of the software that one needs to operate the cloud computer is built in — but it’s another to actually see what that software includes. And for many, it’s seeing the Oxide web console (or its live demo!) that really drives the message home: yes, all of the software is included. And because the console implementation is built on the public API, everything that one can do in the console for the Oxide rack is also available via CLI and API — a concrete manifestation of our code-as-contract approach. \"And there’s no separate licensing?\" One common source of pain for users of on-prem infrastructure has been license management: financial pain due to over-paying and under-utilizing, and operational pain in the navigation of different license terms, different expiration dates, unpredictable dependencies, and uncertain vendor futures. From the beginning we knew that we wanted to deliver a delightful, integrated experience: we believe that cloud computers should come complete with all system software built-in, and with no additional licensing to manage or to pay for. Bug fixes and new features are always only an update away and do not require a multi-departmental discussion to determine value and budget. \"It’s all open source?\" While the software is an essential part of the Oxide cloud computer, what we sell is in fact the computer. As a champion of open source, this allows Oxide a particularly straightforward open source strategy: our software is all open. So you don’t need to worry about hinky open core models or relicensing surprises. And from a user perspective, you are assured levels of transparency that you don’t get in the public cloud — let alone the proprietary on-prem world. Getting your own first impression We’re really excited to have the first commercial cloud computer — and for it to be generally available!

Not as a cobbled together mess of third party stuff where the vendor keeps shrugging if there is an integration problem. They integrated it. It comes with all the features they expect you to want if you wanted to build your own cloud.Also, they wrote the software. And it&#x27;s all open source. So no \"sorry but the third party vendor dropped support for the bios\". You get the source code. Even if Oxide goes bust, you can still salvage things in a pinch.Ironically this looks like the realization of Richard Stallman&#x27;s dream where users can help each other if something doesn&#x27;t work. reply ChuckMcM 14 hours agoparentIts a huge deal. I&#x27;m biased though because my own takes on how things should evolve were very similar. I was however completely unsuccessful in getting those ideas into production! And that, that is a huge deal. Through out my career it has been interesting to meet people with great ideas and then they are unable to get them into production, and when the idea does come into production everyone feels like \"Wow, this is so obvious why didn&#x27;t we do it sooner?\" and some folks are banging their head against the wall :-).One of the more interesting discussions I had during my tenure at Google was about the \"size\" of the unit of clusters. If you toured Google you got the whole \"millions of cheap replaceable computers\" mantra. Sitting in Building 42 was a \"rack\" which had cheap PC motherboards on \"pizza dishes\" without all that superfluous sheet metal. Bunches of these in a rack and a festoon of network cables. What are the \"first class\" elements of these machines? Compute? Networking? Storage? Did you replace components? Or a whole \"pizza slice\" (which Google called an &#x27;index&#x27; at the time). Really a great systems analysis problem.FWIW I&#x27;m more of a \"chunk\" guy (which is the direction 0xide went) and less of a \"cluster\" guy (which is the way Google organized their infrastructure). A lot of people associated with 0xide are folks I worked with at Sun in the early days and during that period the first hints of \"beowulf\" clusters vs \"super computers\", was memory one thing (UMA) or did it vary from place to place (NUMA). I have a paper I wrote from that time about \"compute viscosity\" where the effective compute rate (which at the time largely focused on transactional databases) scaled up with resource (more memory more transactions&#x2F;sec for example) and scaled down with viscosity (higher latencies to get to state meant fewer transactions&#x2F;sec) Sun was invested heavily in the TPC-C benchmarks at the time but they were just one load pattern one could optimize for.These guys have capitalized on all that history and it is fucking amazing! I just hope they don&#x27;t get killed by acquisition[1].[1] KbA is a technique where people who are invested in the status quo and have resources available use those resources to force the investors in a disruptive technology to sell to them and then they quietly bury the disruptive technology. reply mgh95 5 hours agorootparentCan you clarify a bit on what you mean by \"chunk\" guy? Are you alluding to the ability to distribute work by an isolation mechanism such as cgroups vs machine a-la borg&#x2F;google? reply goldinfra 18 hours agoparentprevCoupling vs Decoupling is not some one-sided thing. It&#x27;s a major trade-off.One of the most obvious examples of the problem with this approach is that they&#x27;re shipping previous generation servers on Day 1. One can easily buy current generation AMD servers from a number of vendors.They will also likely charge a significant premium over decoupled vendors that are forced to compete head-to-head for a specific role (server vendor, switch vendor, etc).Their coupling approach will most likely leave them perpetually behind and more expensive.But there are advantages too. Their stuff should be simpler to use and require less in-house expertise to operate well.This is probably a reasonable trade-off for government agencies and the like, but will probably never be ideal for more savvy customers.And I don&#x27;t know how truly open source their work is but if it&#x27;s truly open source, they&#x27;ll most likely find themselves turned into a software company with an open core model. Other vendors that are already at scale can almost certainly assemble hardware better than they can. reply xp84 10 hours agorootparent> will probably never be ideal for more savvy customersIDK about every use case, but slightly older generations of CPUs would affect me roughly zero. I&#x27;m sure there are things so compute-intensive that one would care very much, but a lot of people probably wouldn&#x27;t bat an eye about that, and not because they&#x27;re unsavvy.To the extent that these things are supported as a whole by the vendor rather than a bunch of finger pointing though, that could be massive, specifically in terms of how many staff members you could \"not hire\" compared to if you had to employ someone to both build and continually maintain it.I&#x27;m posting this not to invalidate what you&#x27;re saying, just to say that a little predictable upfront amount of money (the premium) will be spent very happily by lots of people who value predictability and TCO over initial price. reply SoftTalker 9 hours agorootparentIndeed, I&#x27;m still using a cluster of Haswell processors to run VMs for appropriate workloads and it&#x27;s all fine. reply goldinfra 7 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re not rapidly scaling it probably doesn&#x27;t matter. But if you&#x27;re still buying (and maybe even using) Haswell CPUs in 2023, you may be missing out in a big way.A moderately large Haswell cluster is equivalent in power to a moderately powerful modern server. reply dangoor 15 hours agorootparentprev> They will also likely charge a significant premium over decoupled vendorsIt seems like they&#x27;re trying to hit a middle ground between cloud vendors and fully decoupled server equipment companies.Using Oxide is likely cheaper over the life of the hardware than using a cloud vendor. A company who already has in-house expertise on running racks of systems may be less the target market here than people who want to do cloud computing but under their own control. reply sangnoir 14 hours agorootparent> A company who already has in-house expertise on running racks of systems may be less the target market here than people who want to do cloud computing but under their own control.True, but Oxide may find themselves competing against Dell or HP if they adopt Oxides software for their respective servers. Additionally, Oxide may find itself competing against consultants and vendors in specialized verticals (e.g. core Banking software + Oracle DB + COTS servers + Oxide software). Oxide, and their competitors are going for people who used to buy racks of Sun hardware. reply ahhfgsado6698 9 hours agorootparentHP and Dell would have to fundamentally change the way they design hardware and software to be that kind of threat, and if that ever happens I think I would be pretty okay with that outcome. reply lostdog 16 hours agorootparentprevIf they standardize and open the server shape and plug interface then it gets really cool. Then I could go design a GPU server myself and add it to their rack. The rack is no longer a hyperconverged single-user proprietary setup and becomes something that can be extended and repurposed. reply mlindner 12 hours agorootparentprev> One of the most obvious examples of the problem with this approach is that they&#x27;re shipping previous generation servers on Day 1. One can easily buy current generation AMD servers from a number of vendors.> Their coupling approach will most likely leave them perpetually behindThis is a startup that took years to get their initial hardware developed. The time between this version and the version using the next version of AMD chips will be shorter than the time it took to develop this product. This is not an inherent issue with coupling vs decoupling.Also, most servers are rarely running on the most recent cpus anyway. At least in companies I&#x27;ve worked at with on-site hardware they&#x27;re usually years (sometimes even a decade) out of date getting the last life sucked out of them before too many internal users start complaining and they get replaced. reply goldinfra 7 hours agorootparentCoupling requires more integration work, including writing and testing custom firmware. Oxide will be a tiny market player for a long time, even if things go very well. Are AMD and Broadcom really going to spend as much time helping Oxide as they do helping Dell? Of course not, Oxide&#x27;s order volume will be a rounding error.I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll improve their processes over time but the lag will probably always be a non-zero value. Hopefully they&#x27;ll be able to keep it low enough that it&#x27;s not an important factor but as a customer it&#x27;s certainly something one should consider.It would be surprising if they don&#x27;t run into some nasty issue that leaves their customers 6+ months behind on servers or switches at some point. reply DrScientist 34 minutes agorootparent> it would be surprising if they don&#x27;t run into some nasty issue that leaves their customers 6+ months behind on servers or switches at some point.I just think your premise is wrong - most customers don&#x27;t care about not having the absolute latest and greatest. Indeed they will often avoid them because1. They are new so more likely to have as yet undiscovered issues ( hardware or drivers ).2. If you buy top end, they sell at a premium well above their performance premium.ie the customers who are perennially chasing the latest hardware are in the minority. reply mlindner 5 hours agorootparentprevFrom listening to their talks they&#x27;ve actually gotten pretty good direct responses from AMD and AMD likes them quite a bit. They&#x27;ve done what no other system integrator has done and brought up the CPU without using AMD&#x27;s AGESA firmware bootloader. By simplifying the system they&#x27;ve reduced the workload on what they need to handle.The talk here talks about that from about 32:15 : https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osfc.io&#x2F;2022&#x2F;talks&#x2F;i-have-come-to-bury-the-bios-...As to your second point, unless AMD somehow becomes supply constrained and only wants to ship to their most important customers first I don&#x27;t see a future where there would be any lag. Again, the delay this time is from how long it took from company start until product release. Future delays will be based on the time it takes from them getting early development parts to released products, which they could even possibly beat Dell to market on given the smaller company size and IMO more skilled employees.> It would be surprising if they don&#x27;t run into some nasty issue that leaves their customers 6+ months behind on servers or switches at some point.I mean they&#x27;ve already hit tons of nasty issues, for example finding two zero-day vulnerabilities in their chosen security processor. They&#x27;ve shown they can work around issues pretty well. reply Upvoter33 17 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t see it as a big deal - rather, I see it as a huge amount of venture cap spent on some very bright people to build something no one really wants, or, at best, is niche.Also, it has little to do with the cloud; it is yet another hyperconverged infra.Weirdly, it is attached to something very few people want: Solaris. This relates to the people behind it who still can&#x27;t figure out why Linux won and Solaris didn&#x27;t. reply eduction 17 hours agorootparentWhen you&#x27;re deploying VMs, which is the use case here, the substrate OS becomes significantly less important. Those VMs will mostly just be linux.Yes they are using illumos&#x2F;Solaris to host this but they don&#x27;t sell on that, they sell on the functionality of this layer — allowing people to deploy to owned infra in a way that is similar to how they&#x27;d deploy to AWS or Azure. How much do you ever think about the system hosting your VM on those clouds? You think about your VMs, the API or web interface to deploy and configure, but not the host OS. With Oxide racks the customers are not maintaining the illumos substrate (as long as Oxide is around).You could be right about demand, there is risk in a venture like this. But presumably the team thought about this - I think folks who worked at Sun, Oracle, Joyent, and Samsung and made SmartOS probably developed a decent sense of market demand, enough to make a convincing case to their funders. reply yencabulator 16 hours agorootparent> When you&#x27;re deploying VMs, which is the use case here, the substrate OS becomes significantly less important. Those VMs will mostly just be linux.Now you need to know both the OS they chose and the OS you chose...(No, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;ll be 100% hands-off for the host. This is an early stage product, with a lot of custom parts, their own distributed block storage, hypervisor, and so on.) reply tinco 15 hours agorootparentThis true for other hypervisors too. Enterprises are still paying hundreds of millions to VMware, who knows what&#x27;s going on in there?I wouldn&#x27;t have picked Opensolaris, but it&#x27;s a lot better than other vendors that are either fully closed source, or thin proprietary wrappers over Linux with spotty coverage and you&#x27;re not allowed to touch the underlying OS for risk of disrupting the managed product. reply sgt 13 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s more important is that the team actually knows Illumos&#x2F;Solaris inside out. You can work wonders with a less than ideal system. That said, Illumos is of high quality in my opinion. reply Always_Anon 13 hours agorootparentSeems risky considering how small of a developer pool actively works on illumos&#x2F;Solaris. The code is most definitely well engineered and correct, but there are huge teams all around the world deploying on huge pools of Linux compute that have contributed back to Linux. reply tinco 9 hours agorootparentThey had a bug in the database they are using that was due to a Go system library not behaving correctly specifically on illumos. They&#x27;ve got enough engineering power to deal with such a thing but damn.. reply mbakke 9 hours agorootparentprevIf everyone had this mindset we would be running our workloads on Microsoft Windows by now.GNU&#x2F;Linux was also \"risky\" at some point. reply yencabulator 9 hours agorootparentLinux grew up in the bedrooms of teenagers. It was risky in the era of 486 and Pentiums. The environment and business criticality of a $1-2M rack-size computer is quite different. reply mbakke 9 hours agorootparentI had similar thoughts about VMware (large installations) back in the day. Weird proprietary OS to run other operating systems? Yet they turned out fine.This appears to be a much better system than VMware, is free as in software, and it builds upon a free software operating system with lineage that predates Linux.I say this in the most critical way possible, as someone who has built multiple Linux-based \"cloud systems\", and as a GNU&#x2F;Linux distribution developer: I love it! reply usefulcat 7 hours agorootparentprevCompletely tangential, but this reminds me of an interview I had for my first job out of college in 1995. I mentioned to the interviewer that I had some Linux experience. \"Ah, Linux\" he said. \"A cool little toy that&#x27;s gonna take over the world\".In hindsight of course it was remarkably prescient. This from a guy at a company that was built entirely around SGI at the time. replycashsterling 17 hours agorootparentprevBack in the day... Sun Micro was a GOAT and pushed the envelope on Unix computing 20-30 years ago. Solaris was stable and high performing.I don&#x27;t run on-prem clusters or clouds but know a couple people who do and, at large enough scale, it is a constant \"fuck-shit-stack on top of itself\" (to quote Reggie Watts). There is almost always something wrong and some people upset about it.The promise of a fully integrated system (compute HW, network HW, all firmware&#x2F;drivers written by experts using Rust wherever possible) that pays attention to optimizing all your OpEx metrics is a big deal.It may take Oxide a couple more years to really break into the market in a big way, but if they can stick it out, they will do very well. reply icedchai 16 hours agorootparentI used to love Sun and Solaris. Then the dot-com bubble burst, and Linux ate its lunch. I haven&#x27;t seen a new Solaris system deployed in over 20 years. reply Voultapher 17 hours agorootparentprevRight, who wants or benefits from open source firmware anyway.Also there are many situations where renting, for example a flat makes a lot of sense. And there are many situations where the financials and or enabled options of owning something make a lot of sense. Right now, the kind of experience you get with AWS and co. can only be rented, not bought. Some people want to buy houses instead of renting them. reply necovek 16 hours agorootparentWell, you can buy your own hardware and set it up with OpenStack and use it as a private cloud. Companies like Canonical or Redhat make a lot of money by providing software (mostly open source) to support exactly that use case.And Canonical played with a cluster-in-a-box all the way back in 2013-2014: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;canonicals-cloud-in-a-box-unde...You could turn it into an OpenStack cloud in ~20 mins with an automated Juju OpenStack install. reply jjav 15 hours agorootparent> Well, you can buy your own hardware and set it up with OpenStack and use it as a private cloud. Companies like Canonical or Redhat make a lot of money by providing software (mostly open source) to support exactly that use case.Sure you can, but then who will diagnose and fix your hardware&#x2F;OS interaction problems when you have parts from five vendors in the mix?If you haven&#x27;t lived through this, the answer is: nobody. Everyone points fingers at the other 4 and ignore your calls.Back in the day you could buy a fully integrated system (from CPU to hardware to OS) from Sun or SGI or HP and you had a single company to answer all the calls, so it was much better. Today you can&#x27;t really get this level of integration and support anymore.(Actually, you probably can from IBM, which is why they&#x27;re still around. But I have no experience in the IBM universe.)This is why Oxide is so exciting to me. I hope I can be in a company that becomes a customer at some point. reply Always_Anon 15 hours agorootparent>Sure you can, but then who will diagnose and fix your hardware&#x2F;OS interaction problems when you have parts from five vendors in the mix?Dell is a single vendor that will diagnose and fix all of your hardware issues.With Oxide you&#x27;re locked into what looks like a Solaris derivative OS running on the metal and you&#x27;re only allowed to provision VMs which is a huge disadvantage.I run a fleet of over 30,000 nodes in three continents and the majority is Flatcar Linux running on bare metal. Also have a decent amount of RHEL running for specific apps. We can pick and choose our bare metal OS which is something you cannot do with Oxide. That&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow. reply jjav 13 hours agorootparent> Dell is a single vendor that will diagnose and fix all of your hardware issues.I&#x27;ve been a Dell customer at a previous company. I know for a fact that&#x27;s not true.I had a support ticket for a weird firmware bug open for two years, they could never figure it out. I left that job but for all I know the case is still open many years later.Dell doesn&#x27;t know how to fix things like that because they don&#x27;t design and engineer the systems they sell. Dell is a reseller who puts components together from a bunch of vendors and it mostly works but when it doesn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s nobody on staff who can fix it. reply Always_Anon 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been a Dell customer for decades at this rate and I know for a fact it&#x27;s true.I&#x27;ve had support tickets open for all kinda of weird firmware, hardware, etc. bugs and they&#x27;ve been well resolved, even if it meant Dell just replaced the part with something comparable (NIC swap).>Dell doesn&#x27;t know how to fix things like that because they don&#x27;t design and engineer the systems they sell.Of course they do. That&#x27;s like saying Oxide doesn&#x27;t know how to fix stuff because they don&#x27;t design the CPU, NVMe, DIMMs, etc. Oxide is still going to vendors for these things. reply bcantrill 7 hours agorootparentIronically, it was Dell&#x27;s total inability to resolve a pathological rash of uncorrectable memory errors very much is part of the origin story of Oxide: this issue was very important to my employer (who was a galactic Dell customer) and as the issue endured and Dell escalated internally, it became increasingly clear that there was in fact no one at Dell who could help us -- Dell did not understand how their own systems work.At Oxide, we have been deliberate at every step, designing from first principles whenever possible. (We -- unlike essentially everyone else -- did not simply iterate from a reference design.)To make this concrete with respect to the CPU in particular, we have done our own lowest-level platform enablement software[0] -- we have no BIOS. No one -- not the hyperscalers, not the ODMs and certainly not Dell -- has done this, and even AMD didn&#x27;t think we could pull it off. Why did we do it this way? Because all along our lodestar was that problem that Dell was useless to us on -- that we wanted to understand these systems from first principles, because we have felt that that is essential to deliver the product that we ourselves wanted to by.There are plenty of valid criticisms of Oxide -- but that we don&#x27;t understand our system simply isn&#x27;t one of them.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.osfc.io&#x2F;2022&#x2F;talks&#x2F;i-have-come-to-bury-the-bios-... reply Always_Anon 4 hours agorootparentInteresting enough I also ran into something somewhat related with Dell that they were not able to resolve so they ended up working in a replacement from another vendor.Nonetheless, it is quite interesting what you&#x27;ve built, but as the end user I&#x27;m not quote convinced that it matters. Sure you can claim it reduces attack vectors and such but we&#x27;ll still see Dells and IBMs in the most restricted and highest security postured sites in the world. Think DoD and such. Core&#x2F;libreboot with RoT will get me through compliance the same.The software management plane y&#x27;all built is the headlining feature IMHO, not so much what happens behind the scenes that the vast majority of the time will not have a fatal catastrophic upstream effect.>There are plenty of valid criticisms of Oxide -- but that we don&#x27;t understand our system simply isn&#x27;t one of them.That&#x27;s not what I said. There&#x27;s a line in the sand that you must cross when it comes to understanding the true nature of the componentry that you&#x27;re using. At the end of the day, your AMD CPUs may be lying to you, to all of us, but we just don&#x27;t know it yet. reply mlindner 4 hours agorootparentprevAs a side question, what&#x27;s the name of your custom firmware that is the replacement of the AGESA bootloader? I tried searching on the oxide github page but couldn&#x27;t find anything that seemed to fit that description. reply bcantrill 3 hours agorootparent(The AGESA bootloader -- or ABL -- is in the AMD PSP.)

Another point: Having the \"Dell\" name on the front doesn&#x27;t give you a \"throat to choke\" as so many people seem to think is important. Unless you&#x27;re very large scale then, at best, you can threaten them that they don&#x27;t get your next business.

I suspect most people have plenty of stories of opening support tickets with big name vendors that never get resolved. And through the grapevine you find out that they won&#x27;t fix it because they can&#x27;t fix it. They might not even have access to the source code or anyone on staff who has a clue about it because it came from who knows where. Sales is happy to sell you the support contract but it doesn&#x27;t mean your problems can be fixed. BTDT.From listening to the Oxide podcasts, my impression is that Oxide actually can technically fix anything in the stack they sell, which would make them vastly different from Dell et.al. reply yencabulator 13 hours agorootparentSkill-wise, yes for sure (except perhaps for storage -- I haven&#x27;t heard them talk about that much). Bandwidth wise, though?I used to work for a company targeting Fortune 500s. At that level of spend, when a client had a problem, somebody got on a plane. Only a fraction of those problems escalated all the way to R&D, which is where Oxide skills are. That&#x27;s where VMWare etc are hard to beat. reply dasil003 13 hours agorootparentThe premise is that the bandwidth needed will be orders of magnitude less, because the engineering will be orders of magnitude better. The opportunity makes sense as we&#x27;ve long been climbing up the local maximum peak of enterprise sales driven tech behemoths built on a cobbled together mix of open source and proprietary pieces held together with bubblegum.Can an engineering first approach break into the cloud market? Hard to say as enterprise sales is very powerful, and the numerous \"worse is better\" forces always loom large in these endeavours. That said, enterprise sales driven companies are fat, slow and complacent. Oxide is lean and driven, and a handful of killer use cases and success stories is probably enough to sustain them and could be the thin end of the wedge on long-term success. We can hope anyway. replyJeremyNT 20 hours agorootparentprev> Proxmox and a full rack of Supermicro gear would not be as sophisticated, but end result is pretty much the same, with I imagine far far better bang for buck.I think the question is how well they can do the management plane.

The drop shipped, pre-cabled cab setups are definitely nice but that&#x27;s only a part of what Oxide is doing here. No cables and their own integrated switching sounds nice too (stuff from the big vendors like UCS is closer to this ballpark but also probably closer to the cost too).I suspect cooling and rack density could be better in the Oxide solution too, not having to conform to the standards might afford them some possibilities (although that&#x27;s just a guess, and even if they do improve there these may not be the bottlenecks for many). reply throw0101c 18 hours agorootparent> I think the question is how well they can do the management plane.Docs:* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.oxide.computer&#x2F;api&#x2F;guides&#x2F;responsesSee perhaps \"This repo houses the work-in-progress Oxide Rack control plane.\"* https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;oxidecomputer&#x2F;omicron reply jjav 15 hours agorootparentprev> Existing vendors will provide rack integration services and deliver a turn key solution like this.My experience with the likes of Dell is that they&#x27;ll deliver it but they won&#x27;t support it.Sure, there&#x27;s a support contract.

Making sense is about cost and non-cost needs like data gravity and regulatory issues.The cost case only works for GPU heavy workloads which this isn’t - wrong chassis, wrong network, etc.Tofino2 is the wrong choice because even when they made that choice it would have been clear that it’s doa. Intel networking has not been a success center in, well, ever. That’s a selection that could only have been made for nerd reasons and not sensible business goals alignment or risk mitigation.When you make an integrated solution you’d better be the best or close to the best at everything. This does not seem to be the best at anything. I will grant that it is elegant and largely nicer than the hyper converged story from other vendors but in practical terms this is the 2000s era rack scale VxBlock from Cisco or whatever Dell or HPE package today. Marginally better blade server is not a business.They also make a big deal and have focused on things no one who actually builds data center pods cares about.I actually hope they get bought by Dell or HPE or SuperMicro.

IMHO, one of the big drivers of that is just how complex every market has became. Building and selling software alone is so much more multi-disciplinary than it was 10 years ago and adding hardware to the mix is upping that by a huge factor. As I look around, I see so many companies struggle to build teams that can handle the huge range of required tasks. To see a company like Oxide that (once again, from the outside a least) seems to have things together on so many fronts, especially while doing it while sticking strongly to some core values, is pretty inspiring.Not to get overly cynical, but I don&#x27;t think it is an extreme opinion to say that current start-up culture feels like you have to make big compromises in what you believe in order to be successful. Whether that be open-source, how you value and pay employees, or even just rushing things to deliver that aren&#x27;t ready.While I acknowledge Oxide has some well-connected, experienced founders that I am certain enabled them to get the resources and trust to do things their way, I really hope they kill it so that other founders and builders can learn that you still can build not just financially successful products, but great organizations that truly care about their values. reply bcantrill 16 hours agoparentThank you very much for the kind words!

I&#x27;m really into antique espresso machines, and there is a reason that seeing rebuilds of beautiful old lever espresso machines get so many oohs and ahhs online - they truly don&#x27;t make them like they used to, so it&#x27;s so cool to see these beasts brought back to life. For some reason I have a similar feeling looking at these Oxide racks - they just didn&#x27;t cut corners to build an awesome machine.

That market has mostly had to cobble together consumer-inspired HP&#x2F;Cisco&#x2F;whatever stuff historically (like, one of the early talks about the Oxide value proposition was complaining about why every server in the rack needs a CD drive, which was the norm from Dell), because the kinds of stripped-down, super-efficient hardware designs the hyperscalers were building weren&#x27;t available to the general public, so this is that: hyperscaler-like technology for people who want to own it themselves.I think the motivations for why people would want to own their own are probably a mix of financial (at a certain scale there&#x27;s a tipping point and it gets cheaper), and regulatory&#x2F;compliance&#x2F;whatever, like if it&#x27;s healthcare data, or defense, etc. reply bigironcto 20 hours agorootparentThank you for the response.

He wrote a[n in]famous blog about the \"FYO point\" while at Sun. Oxide may be going for customers that also have the same aversion to vendor lock-in.One thing that Bryan understands is that you can \"lock\" the customer in with great products and services, as well as continuing development, while also making the customer feel secure in having a way out should you turn into a company that treats locked-in customers as cash cows. The open source strategy (it is a strategy for Bryan and Oxide) is there precisely to do this: make the customer feel they can leave you, but then not.For your deeply technical staff, having source code access is a big deal too, since it enables them to better understand the products they use.How big is the market of sufficiently-vendor-lock-in-averse customers?

That takes a huge amount of self belief that might be warranted or might be hubris.

I feel like this is competing with that market.Since many of those use cases probably already run extensive on-prem infrastructure this could appeal to them. AWS outpost talks about industries like healthcare, telecom, media and entertainment, manufacturing, or highly regulated spaces like financial services. I&#x27;ve heard of media companies that process through things like IMAX cameras that have just tons of TB&#x27;s of data sometimes just for 5 minutes worth of footage. That would simply be too cost prohibitive - in bandwidth alone - to try and move around in the cloud and you don&#x27;t want to have to wait for things like AWS snowball or whatever.While I think the space is \"niche\" those niche spaces are not small.

Choose any layer of abstraction and start picking at it and you’ll find mostly gaffer tape. Scaling up sucks. Rewriting old monoliths to micro services wasn’t a panacea except maybe for cloud vendor profits. You said the hardware market is well defined, which is another way of saying ossified. Particularly when you start comparing it to the expected pace of software. How’s Open19 going? How much liquid cooling do you have in customer racks?In my opinion this is ultimately a software offering that happens to come on vertically integrated hardware. It offers a complete, highly polished API to a minuscule-scale DC. If they can find market fit and make a little bit of money, the next step is to start making deep improvements to things behind the abstraction. From where you sit, you are well aware that you could make huge improvements inside the DC demarc if you could do it without disrupting customers. But you’re probably limited by the terrible, terrible APIs you would be forced to use, that don’t offer the capabilities you need, from vendors who would be happy to chat but would provide timeframes in the 6-18 month range for even a modest improvement.So this, IMO, is about defining that interface to a DC on a single hardware platform with vertical integration, and then scaling up from there. The current hyperscalers will adopt the suite of APIs and capabilities directly, make lower quality copies, or die.Of course all assuming they’re successful enough to get the revenue machine going in the first place which seems likely to me, given the absolute dogshit state of the cloud world today, the trend towards multi cloud, and the business case for moving certain loads back on prem or to a bare metal colo++ offering. reply INTPenis 13 hours agoparentprevTo be completely honest, this is for the idealists out there.

Content becomes overly dispersed across long scrolling pages with expansive white space and enlarged images and fonts, making it difficult for users to consume and understand the information. By Kim Salazar, Tim Neusesser and Nishi Chitale on October 13, 2023 Topics: Mobile & Tablet, Design Patterns Many modern websites are designed with a mobile-first approach. When these pages render on desktop devices, the content can appear overly large and stretched out. Screen-covering images, large bloated text, and excessive negative space result in long pages requiring more scrolling to consume all content. We call this design trend content dispersion. On This Page: What Is Content Dispersion Design Approaches that Result in Content Dispersion About the Study Negative Effects of Dispersed Content Positive Effects of Dispersed Content Design Recommendations Conclusion What Is Content Dispersion The Homepage of Herman Miller’s website illustrates content dispersion well. When the page scales up to render on a desktop device, the content becomes large and overly dispersed. A long screenshot of Herman Miller’s homepage (left) with two flyouts showing how much of this page renders within the viewport of a 16” laptop screen. Very little content is shown within the viewport, and the text is notably large. Definition: Content dispersion occurs when the content of a responsive webpage appears overly large and stretched out on large laptop or desktop screens. Dispersed content may occur only on certain sections of a page. A single section of dispersed content may not cause significant usability issues. However, when most of the content on a page is overly dispersed, the cumulative impact on usability is largely negative. This article reports the usability issues of mobile-first web design that result in overly dispersed content on desktops. It is based on a study involving 13 qualitative usability tests that were combined with semi-structured interviews. We found that content dispersion on large-screen devices causes an increase in cognitive load and interaction costs, difficulty understanding content, and user frustration. Design Approaches that Result in Content Dispersion Content dispersion is the product of several design trends: mobile-first, minimalism, and large imagery. Often these trends are used in combination to produce pages with low information density. Mobile-First Over 55% of worldwide web traffic comes from mobile devices. As the use of mobile devices continues to grow, so does the importance of mobile designs. This is why the mobile-first design approach, where designers first design for mobile and then adjust the design for tablets and desktop, has become very popular. Minimalism A minimalist style eliminates any design elements that are not required for the core functionality or message of the website. To avoid a cluttered appearance and achieve a minimalist aesthetic, designers make heavy use of negative space and simplify the amount of content displayed in one screen viewport. The result is content dispersion: a long page with low information density. Large Images In the past, slow internet speeds limited the use of high-resolution imagery on websites. Today, however, improved bandwidth has eliminated this design constraint. Many modern web pages use large, high-resolution imagery. Image-focused designs are eye-catching, but they result in overly dispersed text content. A few large images on a desktop page can work well. However, if the page has too many big images, the text-based content that is displayed inline or in between images becomes dispersed and fragmented across the page. Waze.com: The image took almost two-thirds of the viewport width without adding much value, the text was enlarged and bold, and the information density was low. About the Study We conducted 13 qualitative usability tests. We looked at two types of layouts (condensed and dispersed) on two different types of web pages (homepage and product page), for a total of four different prototypes corresponding to all combinations of these variables. To create these prototypes, we searched the web to find real desktop web pages with low content density, expansive negative space, and enlarged text across most parts of the page. We recreated these web pages as dispersed prototypes. For each, we also produced a condensed version using the same content from the original page. The dispersed homepage prototype (left) was developed by recreating Robinhood.com’s homepage. The Robinhood brand was removed, and the page was represented as a fictitious brand. The condensed homepage prototype (right) used the same text-based content as the original dispersed page, displayed in a layout with higher content density. This page was given a different fictitious brand, and the branded imagery was swapped out to make the page appear unique. We had users perform open-ended activities on all 4 prototypes and facilitated a follow-up discussion comparing the two versions of each page type. The full study methodology is available in the sidebar of this article. Negative Effects of Dispersed Content When content dispersion exists across large portions of the page, it can severely impact the user experience overall. Usability issues of dispersed content include: Increased page length and interaction cost Increased cognitive load Difficulty building a conceptual model for the page Increased frustration Lower trustworthiness Content Dispersion Increases Interaction Cost There are two ways through which content dispersion raises interaction costs and makes information hard to find: Long pages that require more scrolling The use of mobile-specific design elements like accordions that require more clicks to access content Long Pages Large-screen rendering of mobile-first websites causes content to become dispersed, resulting in long pages. This effect is amplified when these sites employ minimalist and image-focused design approaches. Long pages require users to scroll more and thus increase the interaction cost. Long pages also make it harder for users to find specific information on the page because the content is spread out over many viewports. Indeed, our study participants had more difficulty finding information on the dispersed product page than on its condensed version. When asked if she found all the information that she was looking for, one participant responded: “Not really. I still don’t know what’s on the other side of the speaker. How is it hooked onto the bike or the chair?” In her effort to find this information, she scrolled through the dispersed page multiple times before she eventually discovered it. One participant struggled to find information about how the speaker could be strapped to a bike. It required much scrolling to find the section with product specifications and information about the material, which included the answer that the participant was seeking. This example shows how difficult it can be to find specific information when the content is highly dispersed. Mobile-Specific Design Patterns Because many websites with dispersed content are the result of a mobile-first design approach, they often use mobile design patterns that frustrate desktop users. For example, accordions work very well on mobile devices because they collapse a large amount of information into a smaller space, shortening the mobile page and making the information more accessible. They also provide a high-level overview of the content available, allowing users to access the area they are interested in directly. However, on large screens, long pages are less of a problem. Accordions can contribute to content fragmentation and significantly increase the interaction cost of finding crucial information, without the benefit they bring on mobile. When viewing the accordion menu of product information on the dispersed prototype, one participant stated: “Like for this part here with the details: I had to click on here if I wanted to read the information. And then I had to close it because I didn't want to keep it all open. So, I would've had to click all of them to read them, instead of me scrolling and trying to see what is important. On other pages, I'm able to click the specs, and boom, it's right here.” The dispersed prototype required participants to interact with every single accordion item to consume all the product information. The design caused frustration and impeded the participants' ability to remember the product specifications easily. One user said, “I prefer this page (the condensed version). It’s less number of clicks. All the information is right there. Everything is right in front of you.” The condensed product specification allowed participants to scan and consume all relevant information easily. Increased Cognitive Load As images get larger and negative space expands, the text-based content gets fragmented across viewports. When related content is chopped up and separated across viewports, it can’t be viewed as a unit. Users must remember information from different viewports (and scroll back and forth between them) in order to reach a conclusion or make a decision. The capacity of their short-term memory can be easily overwhelmed. While viewing the dispersed homepage prototype, one participant described his struggle: “I have to see the offers to talk about them, and it takes a long time […]. It takes me five seconds to scroll, to look at them all, and then get a sense of understanding, and it takes me five seconds to scroll back to see them all.” The dispersed page presented one service per viewport. This layout forced users to remember the details of each service and scroll up and down to compare them. Our condensed product page prototype took the same information from the original dispersed page and arranged it in a 2x2 grid that allowed users to compare multiple services simultaneously, without having to remember the details of each service. The condensed layout displayed more information in the same viewport and alleviated the cognitive burden on users, enabling a more effortless and gratifying browsing experience. The style of imagery used on the webpage also impacts how fragmented the content feels. When the images are informational, people will spend time viewing them to extract useful information. Thus, an informational image stretched out on a large screen is as good as text and is unlikely to cause extra work. However, when images are decorative, people won’t spend time looking at them because they hold no informational value. In these cases, the fragmentation of useful content feels even worse, as users will need to scroll past the bloated illustrations to get small pieces of useful content. When exploring our prototyped homepage, one participant described his frustration: “It's just too much. The image takes up half the block here, but I think that you could put more emphasis on, you know, a small picture and then, I guess, increase the font for the actual description of the product.” When interacting with this part of our prototype, one participant complained about the overly large images that provided no informational value. Difficulty Building a Conceptual Model With an increased page length due to dispersed content and an increased demand on working memory, dispersed pages made it more difficult for users to assess information and build a mental model of the concepts communicated on the website compared to our condensed prototype. One participant struggled to build a mental model of the concepts described on the dispersed homepage prototype, saying, “Having to try to retain the four or five offers to understand the scope, rather than seeing the four or five offers all together to understand the scope is more difficult for me.” In another instance, we saw this same difficulty in building a conceptual understanding of a wireless speaker on our dispersed product page prototype. When making a purchasing decision, users tend to consider multiple factors, such as the price, product details, reviews, and more. When these key pieces of information were spread over many viewports, they were forced to consume it separately and remember it. This negatively impacted users’ ability to gain an understanding of the product, which allows them to make a confident purchasing decision. When important information is delivered together or across fewer viewports, it’s easier to build a conceptual understanding. When talking about the differences between the dispersed and condensed product pages, one participant explained: “I tend to forget a lot of things. So, on this page (the dispersed page), I have to constantly scroll to revisit the information to remember it, whereas on this page (the condensed page), I have all the information together on the screen.” Difficulty building a conceptual model is amplified when users encounter the illusion of completeness, an issue more prevalent on dispersed websites, as they often use color blocks that create strong horizontal lines across the viewport or expansive negative space that can falsely signal that the content on the page is complete. If no scrolling cues exist to indicate that there is more content to discover, users are likely to miss this content. One participant who encountered the illusion of completeness at the top of the dispersed prototype gave the site a 5 out of 7 for ease of use. When asked why he gave this rating, he explained how the illusion had originally stumped him, saying, “Well, just because I was doing it on the laptop screen […] I didn't have a sense that there was information below the headline there and so I only saw half the page on my laptop. […] It just so happens, it's framed just right on my laptop that it looks like a full page […] There are just no cues, I'm not at the bottom. […] I just don't naturally go into a place and scroll and say, where's the bottom?” When interacting with our dispersed prototype, one participant encountered the illusion of completeness. Because there was nothing at the bottom of the screen indicating more content existed, he assumed he was at the bottom of the page when he was only viewing the top portion. Trustworthiness Decreases Due to the usability issues described above, dispersed websites appear to provide less, yet harder-to-access content. Some users feel that the company is hiding information and may lose trust in it. One participant said that “transparency is a big part” and that it’s important that “information is easy to see and it’s not like the website is hiding anything.” When this was the case, “it created a sense of security, comfort, and transparency that people like and need.” For these reasons, users showed a clear preference for a condensed layout, especially when their goal was to explore the website and build an overall understanding of its offerings. Positive Effects of Dispersed Content When an entire page becomes dispersed, the cumulative impact on usability is largely negative. However, there were some instances where content dispersion had a positive effect on the experience. Because dispersion decreased the amount of content displayed within the viewport, it allowed users to focus on one piece of highlighted content at once and limited the perception of information overload. Highlighting information by reducing the content density within a viewport can benefit the experience when: Content is complex, allowing users to focus on understanding one piece at a time. Users need to familiarize themselves with the displayed content and, thereby, could be overwhelmed by too much information. High-value imagery is displayed. Large product pictures can add value by making it easy for users to examine the image to observe the fine details of a product. When viewing the dispersed product page with large product images, one participant stated: “What made the (dispersed) page a lot easier is that all the features were separated. It was more focused on presenting it visually and individually vs. having everything grouped together. This made it a lot easier to read and understand.” A participant remarked positively about the ability to see the product's details with large pictures and corresponding explainer text. When the images used are of high informational value, the resulting dispersion may be justified. However, as discussed, images used as filler or strictly for visual interest cause dispersion without added benefits. That is likely why the positive effects of content dispersion were less likely to be observed on the homepage prototype, where images are less valuable. Design Recommendations As more and more web traffic comes from mobile devices, the mobile-first approach will likely increase in popularity. Minimalist and image-focused design aesthetics are also here to stay. Given the usability implications of these design approaches on desktop experiences, designers should follow these design recommendations to avoid the biggest pitfalls: Evaluate how designs render on desktop. If desktop rendering makes a large portion of the page excessively stretched out, reevaluate whether important content should be redesigned to allow for scannability on desktop. Evaluate the value added by images. Prioritize large images that add contextual understanding of the product or service offered. Ask yourself if the value of the large images is worth the dispersion they cause on desktop. Keep critical, related content grouped together in the same viewport. Consider which information is most relevant to understanding the offering and choose designs that keep this content together to reduce back-and-forth scrolling. Avoid mobile-specific interactions and design elements. Limit the use of accordions on desktop and consider adaptive designs that display this content in desktop-friendly ways. Understand when dispersion can be used strategically to focus attention on key points or complex pieces of content. Conclusion Minimalist desktop pages with dispersed content can limit distractions and focus attention on key points or complex pieces of information. However, an entire page that employs a mobile-first, minimalist, image-focused design creates usability issues on desktop.

    "commentBody": "The negative impact of mobile-first web design on desktopHacker NewspastloginThe negative impact of mobile-first web design on desktop (nngroup.com) 709 points by skadamat 19 hours ago| hidepastfavorite434 comments r113500 17 hours agoDanny o&#x27;brien, he runs one of the oldest surviving blogs, oblomovka, coined a term \"hinternet\" sometime in 2007, that was when the internet was still being run by the technological elite, for themselves, but normal people have also joined. The idea of hinternet was that there was essentially two internets. One is the sophisticated technology and a value add, and the other one is the internet of the viagra pills and popup banners. We, the technology elite, would rarely venture into the hinternet, like going into a bad neighborhood, where&#x27;s normal people had no such mechanism for discernment, so their experience of the internet was distinctly different and inferior.Now most of the internet is hinternet, and we&#x27;re all forced more and more to rely on it. Banking systems, mortgage platforms, car payments, utilities payments are generally designed mobile first, desktop later, they employ various dark techniques for \"verifying real user\", which break on open platforms, forcing you to access them from iPads and other such locked down devices, or not at all. If hinternet used to be the dark shady streets where hucksters were peddling you knockoff watches, then now hinternet is the dystopian landscape of vertical information integration, ran, behind the scenes, by para-governmental institutions. You can&#x27;t log in into irs without using id.me, a digital wallet and identity management platform, that sells you things.There are attempts to cultivate little gardens of sophistication, but they are of mixed success. On a personal level there&#x27;s a strong disincentive to participate in the hinternet beyond the mandatory, carefully navigating poorly designed and conceived systems just long enough to achieve an objective. One has to login into irs, but one doesn&#x27;t really need to read that popup and upsell blocked, mobile centric news article.From this perspective \"mobile-first web design\" is a symptom removed from its greater context. reply nonrandomstring 15 hours agoparentThis \"hinternet\" is a cool concept, but there&#x27;s something missing from its account.On one side we have the cultured elites of academia, the military and government - as rightful founders.On the other, the unwashed masses, immigrants of the Eternal September. Eventually this hoi polloi of hucksters, chancers and grifters became naturalised as the businesses and bankers in the new world.The dotcom era is a colonisation story and the elites are the aboriginal natives driven off their own land. It sure fits a \"woke\" narrative.But what&#x27;s missing from this fairy-tale is the actual real people.The truth is, dotcom, Web2.0 and the empire building between 1997 and about 2010 was still a marginal affair, where existing money and power moved into the internet, along with a handful of rugged \"entrepreneurs\" (as we like to call ourselves around here).The 99% remained spectators caught between the Scylla and Charibdes, and now they are corralled into ranches, all lovingly watched over...The potential for a \"people&#x27;s internet\" still remains, but we have not solved many (indeed any) of the classical problems of freeloaders, tragedy of the commons.... and at this point I think \"Web 3.0 and blockchain web\" is dead (?)A good start to moving things forward to an internet that is once again public, high-quality and large might be looking more closely at the history&#x2F;narrative of the internet and who the real stakeholders are. reply oldbbsnickname 9 hours agorootparentMost problems stem from users conflating for-profit corporations for public commons. Nonprofit co-ops must provide critical infrastructure.Who exactly is this prerogative \"freeloader\" you throw around so casually? Is there some service or good denied others involved? reply nonrandomstring 1 hour agorootparent> Who exactly is this prerogative \"freeloader\" you throw around so casually? Is there some service or good denied others involved?Spammers would be a good example. They freeload on the mail routing network. Their actions deny service, as bandwidth, storage and wasted time to millions of ordinary users. reply williamcotton 8 hours agorootparentprevFor any readers, “Scylla and Charybdis” is the OG “rock and a hard place.” reply bryanrasmussen 5 hours agorootparentyou mean - for any readers from the unwashed masses surely?!? reply r113500 11 hours agorootparentprevyou misunderstood the concept, brought in your own windmills, and then successfully attacked them. I guess it generated an interesting subthread, even if it did derail my point into the tired \"internet ain&#x27;t what it used to be!\" direction. god, I was hoping what I said was more subtle than that. other people in the thread have done better, even managed to use google to search the original posts on oblomovka so that they can reflect on the point, instead of just typing things.but to your \"people&#x27;s internet\" point, the real communism has clearly never been tried! it&#x27;s not the people that want TikTok, it&#x27;s the power structure. left to their own devices they built cathedrals! reply nonrandomstring 57 minutes agorootparentSorry if I stole some of your thunder there old chap. I don&#x27;t think I \"misunderstood the concept\" but rather found it wanting and moved the discussion on. The focus was your precis of the term \"hinternet\" which I found very interesting and so addressed.Where it landed (perhaps thanks to TeMPOraL) was actually quite exciting in my opinion, that, in the words of The Jam: \"the public wants what the public gets.\"That&#x27;s something different from the tired old \"internet ain&#x27;t what it used to be!\" trope. Isn&#x27;t it? : That the entire \"market theory\" of the internet (and maybe technology in general) is mostly myth.> real communism has clearly never been tried!Not sure I follow how a vibrant, diverse, bottom-up, self-governed Internet would be akin to \"communism\", but then you&#x27;ve got your own windmills to tilt at too. reply adventured 15 hours agorootparentprevThe people have their Internet already. They like Netflix, they like Amazon Prime, they love TikTok, they like Instagram, they like Pinterest, they like their various chat apps, they like their online gaming, and so on.That is all that they want. Along with some decent ecommerce for shopping and safe, easy to use mobile banking.There&#x27;s nothing magical about it, and there never will be. They don&#x27;t want fluffy magical bullshit. They already have most of what they want and there&#x27;s nothing grandiose about it, it&#x27;s overwhelmingly just quasi-boring pedestrian entertainment and amusement to pass the time. That&#x27;s what they wanted before the Internet, and it&#x27;s what they naturally want with the Internet. It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re tired from their days, their 307 serious life problems (health, mortgage, bills, stress, job), and their exhausting children (that they love dearly of course).No no no, the peoples Internet must be a vision of splendor! The masses want to spend all day creating extraordinary art, and thinking deeply about complex subjects they just educated themselves on! That&#x27;s not reality, and it&#x27;s not what the masses want at all. Not even remotely close.They want a garbage pile of chaos like Reddit. Where they can insult people without getting punched in the face, and they can learn some tips about wood working other there, and they can look at photos of modded cars over in another sub, and they can go back to insulting someone over in another sub, and then they can watch a stream of rockets being fired at&#x2F;from Gaza in another thread.The peoples Internet is already here. reply _Algernon_ 13 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s two types of wants. The low want of a heroin addict who wants his next fix, and the higher want of the same heroin addict who wants to get clean and a better life. These \"wants\" can both coexist. If you only use their actions to infer their wants you completely ignore the existence of their higher order wants. It&#x27;s dehumanizing.The people want the internet in the \"next fix\" sense. But I&#x27;d argue that the increase in mental illness globally the last ~15 years (starting a couple of years after the introduction of the iPhone) or even just the recent popularity of \"digital detoxes\" implies that there is a collective higher order want for a better internet. reply TeMPOraL 12 hours agorootparentBoth you and GP are assuming people to be perfectly spherical rational actors in a philosophical vacuum. Under this assumption, people are indeed responsible for what they get, as the market only serves the demand. But that&#x27;s not the world we live in - in our world, \"revealed preferences\" are bunk, because the suppliers have a lot of tools to control the demand.The \"hoi polloi\" aren&#x27;t born with fully fleshed out idea of \"what they really want\". Nor do they have much ability to communicate their wants to the market directly. Rather, their wants are in large part created by marketers, and the only signal they can send to the market (via \"voting with your wallet\") is their relative preferences for options available on the market. That is, they only get to choose from what&#x27;s available. And what&#x27;s available is under control of the vendors.The way this relates to your \"lower&#x2F;higher order wants\" is that my actions can actually communicate either of them. Where I spend my attention, or my money, can be driven directly by a high-order want - but I&#x27;m still limited to expressing that need only by choosing from a very limited set of actions or products that are available, and then my choice is also heavily biased by sales tricks and manipulative advertising strategies.In short: I claim that the market is currently robbing all consumers of agency - \"hoi polloi\" and ${whatever the complement to that is called} alike. This is especially pronounced in tech industry, as commercial software resist commoditization - most apps and services are sticky and not interchangeable, so the UX decisions aren&#x27;t being strongly influenced by competitive pressure. The vendors have an actual choice of how useful or how abusive they want to be. And they should get the blame when they choose the latter. reply nonrandomstring 11 hours agorootparentThis is an insightful explanation.I see a three stage change, from the pre-Bernays world of informational advertising and functional markets, to the post-Bernays world of contrived demand driven by psychological advertising, to what we have now.Now we have policy driven economics in which technological goods are foisted upon the population and a post-hoc rationale of why they are necessary is relentlessly pushed as an explanatory narrative.We&#x27;re approaching the point where the \"very limited set of actions or products \" is so dominant that the only choice looks like abstinence; the \"Luddite&#x27;s\" choice to not be abused. reply kevinsync 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat about the middle ground want of a heroin addict who loves heroin but wants pure, unadulterated, properly-dosed, controlled, trustworthy heroin from reputable, consistent vendors, accessed sanely and easily, taken quietly and unobtrusively, so they can float around and have a good time when it fits into their life?Isn&#x27;t that the dream of good technology and good internet?People want the \"next fix\" internet because that&#x27;s all they know. People would likely prefer a different internet if they ever had the chance to experience it. reply throwaway290 1 hour agorootparentprevYou undermine the argument in favor of \"better internet\" with a terrible analogy from war on drugs.There are plenty normal, highly functional heroin users whom we don&#x27;t know about because they hide this (since it&#x27;s prosecuted). The poster examples of abuse are not them however, which helps justify prosecution. On the other hand there are people with mental issues who will get addicted to anything, if not heroin then weed, if not weed then gambling, if not gambling then social media, etc etc. Maybe \"dehumanizing\" is trying to ban every potential vice rather than fixing the issues that lead to misuse. The cause vs. the symptom. reply nonrandomstring 28 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;d highly recommend \"The Myth of Normal\" by Gabor Mat\\&#x27;e as the long version of this position.But beware, once you accept its premise one must concede by the same token, those who prey upon the vulnerable in society, whether they are heroin farmers and dealers, or addictive app developers, are cut from the same moral cloth. The \"legality\" or \"illegality\" of the end product is immaterial, only the social effects. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentprev> The people have their Internet already. They like [...]Those are the things that have literally no value me. You&#x27;d think the internet would be large enough to address pretty much everybody&#x27;s needs, including mine, but it&#x27;s getting pretty clear that it&#x27;s not. reply Apocryphon 11 hours agorootparentKuro5hin, Slashdot, heck- The WELL all still exist. Old-school platforms and communities are on the internet. So do old-fashioned personal websites. They might have a pittance of users, but they&#x27;re out there. Is that not what you want? But what you can&#x27;t want, is for a large amount of people to use them, if they have no inclination to.It&#x27;d be great if everyone started making their own Neocities site. Or even just drop contemporary social media and join the new Friendster (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38021802) or Spacehey. But the cultural impetus just isn&#x27;t there. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the economies of scale at work. It&#x27;s more profitable to address larger markets with cheaper and worse products, than a smaller market with better but more expensive products.Now, given the near-zero up-front costs to making software, there should still be enough room for all the niche needs, but the annoying thing is, the computing ecosystem itself - the hardware, the software platforms (OS, browsers) and even the tools used to make them - it&#x27;s all being optimized for the mass market &#x2F; lowest common denominator. As silly as it is, professionals can&#x27;t get good tools, because the tooling is caught in the gravity well of more generic, mass market products.The part that really gets me is how this starts making effective use of computers (\"bicycle for the mind\" stuff) impossible. My go-to example: it doesn&#x27;t matter if you figure out how to make fully open source & open hardware smartphones for nerds. Even if you make them competitive on price and power with mass-market products. It doesn&#x27;t matter that you somehow hired John Ousterhout and Edward Tufte to make the maximally ergonomic and functional apps for the platform. I&#x27;m still going to buy a regular locked down smartphone, because I need one to be able to use my bank account, and my bank - like all other banks - demand you use a locked-down device from a major vendor, with full device attestation (\"because security\").The freedom of computing stops at the network. reply nonrandomstring 11 hours agorootparent> As silly as it is, professionals can&#x27;t get good tools, because the tooling is caught in the gravity well of more generic, mass market products.This also happened in hardware.Back in the day we could design wide range devices using quite widely available \"mil-spec\" semiconductors and components - a common difference was in logic circuits where you had 74-series in consumer and commercial (0 °C to 70 °C and −40 ° to 85 °C temperature ranges) and milspec 54-series that would suffer −55 °C to 125 °C.Following something in the 90s called the Perry initiative IIRC, the rules changed to test-based performance that enhanced \"market supply\" rather than prescribed manufacturing methods, so after STD-883 almost all wide range components disappeared.Sure if you&#x27;re NASA or the US DoD you can get stuff made, but increasingly everyone has to source from the same few commercial suppliers. The upshot is that if you&#x27;re organising an Antarctic survey, or going into the desert it&#x27;s almost impossible to kit our with modern gear that won&#x27;t fail. You&#x27;re stuck trawling eBay for some 1980s Soviet stuff. reply Belopolye 6 hours agorootparentprevBravo. I am reminded of the “noble savage” concept whenever I read that the people will rise up and support the libre Internet, if they would simply be introduced to it, from pseudo-vanguard tech-literati.Dialectical virtualism?The market has spoken, and the market prefers locked-down platforms and subscriptions. reply nonrandomstring 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a huge amount of truth in what you say. Hence I used the pejorative \"Hoi Polloi\".But you can probably tell I once worked for the BBC. And what might look like elitism (of the kind I wouldn&#x27;t apologise for) is really hope for wider humanity in spite of the Rupert Murdock effect, in spite of a concerted 50 year assault on education, and in spite of the misappropriation of the internet as a giant firehose for diarrhoea. The West&#x27;s self-devouring and terminal-stage enshitification is quite the spectacle.So when we look at \"the people\" and say this or that is \"what they want\", something recoils inside me. Do we know that? A perpetual cycle where people know what they like and they like what they know is not a stasis or fact of the world but a precarious place of comfortable mediocrity we&#x27;ve come to be. A local minima. There are other places. Cultures have flourished. And sometimes they wane.The Internet (big I) was more than just a lot of wires, it was an idea. Maybe some fragments of that idea are still alive, I don&#x27;t know. reply hyggetrold 14 hours agorootparent> So when we look at \"the people\" and say this or that is \"what they want\", something recoils inside me. Do we know that?The famous (controversial) Indian teacher Osho had a saying on this: \"Democracy. Government of the people, by the people, for the people...but the people are retarded.\" reply bad_user 13 hours agorootparentWe often look down on \"the people\", but the masses have more wisdom than the elites, even if societal consensus can sometimes lead to terrible solutions to problems.Democracy is nuanced, much like reality, and this bothers people. reply hyggetrold 13 hours agorootparent> the masses have more wisdom than the elitesI used to think this way also but in recent times I have become less sure. Maybe the easiest way to explain my thinking is to recall that line from the movie Men in Black: \"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky animals, and you know it.\"Obviously the truth is way more complex than that but I really do doubt the wisdom of the crowds.A different example might the guys who wrote up the Constitution of the United States. More people were illiterate than literate back in those days. The founders were a small elite, but they created a framework that has served millions of people for a few hundred years.In any case, yes, democracy is nuanced. It is the best system despite its flaws. And to be frank, the real issue with democracy is that it&#x27;s run by people...and hardly any of us walk on water. :) reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentI agree, and my take is that the mass of people has, between them, much more \"domain wisdom\". Different groups have deep understanding of different things. Villagers understand small settlement dynamics; urban dwellers understand towns. People near the sea understand all things related to it; people in grasslands understand nuances of farming better than those in the mountains, etc.The problem is, you have to reach relevant subgroups to access that wisdom - otherwise, when you&#x27;re just polling the entire population on a specific topic, well... few subgroups are experts, but everyone has an opinion, so it averages down to \"dumb, panicky animals\". reply bad_user 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d rather not be mistaken for a populist. Certainly elites have been pushing society forward.Democracy is about accepting the fact that people know their own needs better than everyone else does, and that they should be free to express those needs, and to elect representatives that will fight for those needs. Even when we are talking about an illiterate population.Personally, given recent times, I think the political axis is bullshit, because the real divide, that&#x27;s driving polarisation, is between liberalism and autocracy. The allure of autocracy is getting stronger, many feel the need for someone wise to force the plebs into doing things \"for their own good\". Just one example — vaccination certificates, which in my country did not work, and effectively discriminated against the poor.I don&#x27;t know much about the history of US&#x27;s founding, but until a document becomes culture, it&#x27;s just a piece of paper to wipe your ass with ;-) reply fijiaarone 7 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not that the masses are so smart, it’s that the “elites” are so mind bogglingly stupid. reply BlueTemplar 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah, it&#x27;s about how in a monarchy not only can things get way more rotten, but also transitions of power tend to be very bloody (and wasteful) affairs. reply kodisha 12 hours agorootparentprev> The Internet (big I) was more than just a lot of wires...Yup, it was a series of tubes :) reply willi59549879 3 hours agorootparentprevwhy is it so important that internet is capital? in english it would all be lower case to be gramatically correct, in german all nouns are capital reply sangnoir 13 hours agorootparentprev> [...] terminal-stage enshitification is quite the spectacle.I see you&#x27;re an optimist.

Keep computing hardcore! reply krapp 10 hours agorootparentprevExcept \"the masses\" do create extraordinary art and educate themselves. Really, we&#x27;re in the midst of an artistic and creative renaissance on all fronts and in all media, specifically because of the capabilities you hate about the modern web. You just aren&#x27;t aware of it because it thrives on platforms you would never be caught dead on.And the \"elites\" are the ones who created the toxicity of web and gaming culture and made bank on all of those pedestrian forms of entertainment... which they themselves also consume. reply r113500 9 hours agorootparentthanks to the bbc brit, the subthread essentially culminated in your comment. I&#x27;d like to clarify that this dichotomy didn&#x27;t exist in my original. \"technology elite\" like somebody hinted elsewhere in the thread, could be a dirt poor kid from underprivileged background, whose accidental access to a computer was the only means of escape from the oppressive reality. at a certain level of technological sophistication one could gain capabilities and access that make one belong to a select group, making one part of the elite. from this perspective, \"the masses\" are literally everyone else who wasn&#x27;t on the internet in the early 2000s. yes, by weight and numbers there will be an inordinate amount of talented individuals among them. there will also be perhaps an even bigger number of complete and utter mediocrities. since the person you&#x27;re responding to doesn&#x27;t use the term \"elites\", I can only assume it&#x27;s everyone you don&#x27;t like, because some of them would&#x27;ve been technological elites, who then became financial ones, but then some of them would&#x27;ve been financial elites, who remained financial elites never becoming technological ones, and yet by the power of their capital they&#x27;ve exploited technology. they are I guess bad. most of the humanity are good, because a lot of talented ones make art. what a pointless subthread, god damn. reply krapp 8 hours agorootparent>what a pointless subthread, god damn.Welcome to Hacker News.

The seedy parts of the 90s internet with illegal content hosted on free hosts? Because you say today&#x27;s internet is like that, and I don&#x27;t see any comparison at all however I look at it.How is the 90s Internet (forums, IRC, Viagra spam and goatse) anything like the modern sterilized version full of dark patterns in the hands of a dozen megacorps? reply itronitron 13 hours agorootparentBy way of analogy, 90&#x27;s internet was like exploring a town where you could wander around and check things out, and some open lots had billboards with ads on their property. Every property had a list of other properties that you might want to also check out.Current internet (hinternet?) is like walking through the same town but now there are fences around everything and posts with security cameras at every property boundary. When visiting a property now you are required to show your face and maybe ID, and also have to sign up to get a rewards card. When visiting a property you also have people with clipboards following you around and taking notes which they pass to people with clipboards at other properties. reply cfeduke 15 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I gather from Oblomovka[1] [and based on my own memory of this period]:It was a place where the primary early users of the Internet did not frequent, but could be something an ordinary person would be exposed to out of necessity. (Think, maybe some service that lets one send faxes via email; notably you&#x27;d need to create an account and spend money.) But, at some point, this reversed, and ordinary use cases dominate - online banking, e-commerce, school - such that even finding the original sort of content that comprised most of the Internet can be very difficult.[2]As an example, cooking recipe websites in the early Internet contained cooking recipes - no stories, no SEO optimization - and then sometimes at the bottom of the page participated in some sort of link exchange with other recipe websites and perhaps a page hit counter. This was an Internet for the technologist, and one might find their way there from a BBS, IRC, email, word of mouth, or early search engines that naively indexed keywords, or you know, by surfing a webring. These sites seldom existed for any sort of commercial gain and were often a hobby project.Today you could reasonably expect to find your way to a cooking recipe site via a search engine where each recipe has been SEO optimized with a nonsense story and you might be prompted to log in with Google or create an account to view the actual recipe. The target audience are the people who are the norm and would have been those visiting the hinternet two decades ago, out of necessity [e.g., pay to send a fax via email], but today they are just normal people performing normal activities.Something like today&#x27;s network of sites two decades ago would be hinterlands by the blog&#x27;s definition - not frequented[2]. Today, it is the norm.1. two competing definitions, circa 2001-03: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oblomovka.com&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2003&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;hinternet-fallout&#x2F;2. it&#x27;s been decided to call this sort of genuine content \"Small Web\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kagi.com&#x2F;smallwebX. the competing definition of hinternet, which I also like (search \"hinternet\"): http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thegestalt.org&#x2F;simon&#x2F;cluetrain.html reply WWLink 14 hours agorootparentThere were also tech sites that reviewed computer hardware in writing. Sometimes with pictures. There were websites with video game walkthroughs - also in text, with pictures! There were websites with silly things people wrote about, and funny stories, and the usual tinfoil hat stuff. But the tinfoil hat stuff was secluded away on a tinfoil webring on angelfire.There were tons of stores. Usually the more legit ones partnered with yahoo shopping or whatever. I remember buying Pokemon Yellow from a video game store based out of Canada lol. I think it was called dragon.ca? There were TONS of places. Some would take a week to ship but you usually got your stuff. :DIRC had something for everyone. Those networks had tens of thousands of people online at any given time, talking about everything from tech to trash (literally) lol.There were also web directories. As I recall, google started off using one of those as a source.There was also stuff like AOL that had its own little ecosystem of corporate-sponsored stuff. reply Apocryphon 11 hours agorootparentAll of that still exists, just in reduced numbers. Browse Neocities. Or search Wiby.me reply massysett 11 hours agorootparentprevI just went to Google and searched “recipes”. The top link is allrecipes.com, where the homepage leads me to numerous recipes. No stories.It absolutely exists for commercial gain. It’s also a lot more useful than what existed 30 years ago. reply TeMPOraL 15 hours agorootparentprev> How is the 90s Internet (forums, IRC, Viagra spam and goatse) anything like the modern sterilized version full of dark patterns in the hands of a dozen megacorps?The hinternet was the Viagra spam and goatse part. The modern, sterilized version is exactly that - continuous abuse and exploitation. Just with a fig leaf of legitimacy.EDIT: perhaps a better distinction would be this: O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Internet was&#x2F;is that which comes from focusing on benefit for the user (be it utility or entertainment). The hinternet is that which comes from focusing on making money. Now, focusing on utility does not preclude commerce - in fact, the most basic and honest way of making money is by exchange for something of value. Focus on value provided includes figuring out how to provide it sustainably.

You need someone with a deep knowledge of html, css, and the supportive web apis. A good frontend engineer is incredibly rare, even at big tech. What&#x27;s even more rare is a UX designer that also thinks about these things, who are worth a million bucks. reply karaterobot 15 hours agoparentThanks for saying so. I was a front-end developer for many years, and felt both the difficulty and the persistent lack of appreciation for that difficulty. I ended up quitting and just becoming a designer, because if I&#x27;m not going to get any respect, at least I shouldn&#x27;t have to keep running on the treadmill of new technologies. I have also done back-end development, and it is certainly difficult in its own way, but for the money I&#x27;d rather work on that than the front end.Having done all three, I have a mental model with two axes: appreciation and meddling. It might be appropriate to sketch it here.With design, the result of your work ends up being visual, so you get a lot of appreciation for it. Maybe too much, sometimes. On the other hand, everyone has an opinion about how you could do your job better, and they&#x27;re happy to stick their fingers into your work (because it&#x27;s so easy, you know?).With back-end development, nobody is going to meddle in your work except other engineers: by meddle, I mean step in and tell you how to do it better. That&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t know what you do at all. The other side of that opaqueness, though, is that you rarely get credit for good work. Stuff just works the way it should.Front-end development is in between the two. People will give you credit when things work the way they should, and when they look nice, and so on. But, half the time when an application is \"snappy\" and performant, they&#x27;ll credit the designer for it (ha ha). At the same time, they&#x27;ll also tell you how things \"should\" work, based on how other applications do it. Meanwhile, you&#x27;re stuck between what the designer approved, and what the back-end supports, and you&#x27;re just doing your best to make it all work. reply iamcasen 14 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ve outlined it so well! \"you&#x27;re stuck between... and you&#x27;re just doing your best to make it all work.\"Couple that with the fact that the whole front-end world has gone completely bonkers, reinventing the wheel so many times in the last 10 years I&#x27;m surprised my head hasn&#x27;t separated from my body.It&#x27;s funny that things have come full-circle these days, going back to server-rendered views.

Entire processes of the business have been built on top of that functionality.

Backend work is a series of black boxes. You can make a million mistakes and it won&#x27;t necessarily be an issue. With the frontend your work is exposed for everyone to see and critique.

This is typical for complex web software.A frontend system that provides the interface to that backend system will usually not have issues arise in the middle of the night due to the automated processes happening on the backend, will not have to worry about how many users are using the system nor how much underlying data there is.No matter how difficult it is to do the initial development of the frontend (or to keep that code updated when browsers change), at the end of the day once the development is done it&#x27;s static code interfacing with a much more complex underlying system that requires constant attention as underlying data and business requirements evolve. reply zeroCalories 14 hours agorootparentThe frontend isn&#x27;t done after the initial work. Requirements frequently change and update as management gets new ideas. Additionally, the frontend isn&#x27;t spared from the concerns of scaling. You&#x27;ll often be tasked with demands to decrease load from clients to help the backend keep up, which will involve lots of clever caching and tricks like debouncing. Finally, scaling on the backend isn&#x27;t nearly as hard these days given all of the existing tech you can leverage like k8s and the cloud.

My personal opinion is that if you&#x27;re using media queries for anything other than \"screen\" vs \"print\" you&#x27;re absolutely doing it wrong, in particular, media queries for screen size are a red flag.To me, the trick to using flexbox effectively is to use it to create fully reactive layouts the way that Gtk or Qt would design them. I create flexbox interfaces in terms of \"VBox\" and \"HBox\" containers, I use flex-grow to handle the concept of \"box packing.\"Once I started seeing it through this lens, and when CSS finally added calc() and other functions writing good and consistent frontend UIs that mimic precisely how almost all other desktop software behaves became incredibly simple.The only real complaint I have is that after I have a finished product, going back and making changes is harder than what other techniques might afford, thankfully HTML addedand by incorporating that liberally into my designs I&#x27;ve regained some of the original careless flexibility I had before it. reply wg0 5 hours agorootparentThank you for your answer.

It&#x27;s not and never has been a static medium like paper. It&#x27;s not limited to a specific size and shape like paper, and should not be treated as if it were. Web \"designers\" should not be trying to force the content into any specific size or pixel resolution, as there&#x27;s just too many different resolutions of screens and width vs. height layouts of those screens to ever be able to cover them all appropriately without adapting to the idea that the content must be able to flow accordingly. It also severely harms accessibility for folks with vision issues who might scale up their fonts to compensate if doing so causes the content to break in horrible ways that make it unreadable. reply klysm 18 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s easy to say stuff like this, but go try and implement it.

The job of developing on the web is developing for a platform where you do not know the size or format of the display or what the inputs are in advance.The job of a UX designer on the web is to consider this kind of stuff and to build a design that&#x27;s very reactive to evolving displays within the demographics and market segments that the client wants to support. If that&#x27;s not happening, if the CSS people are just getting handed static designs and being told to figure it out -- the problem is not CSS or the developers, it&#x27;s that the designers building those designs are not good at their jobs. And there are ways to make this easier: notably UX designers involving the CSS department in the design phase, and&#x2F;or making a point to always lay out the contents of the page without styling in a hierarchical way before making decisions about how to present that content.But a lot of programming is hard. It&#x27;s hard for me to write maintainable Javascript that doesn&#x27;t fall apart if a project goes over 100,000 lines of code. It&#x27;s hard to document methods. It&#x27;s hard for me to write code that does complicated things that can work on low-end machines. These are skills that programmers get better at over time with practice. Responsive design is the same; it&#x27;s just another skill to learn.Imagine trying to shoot a movie and having the cinematographer tell you that it&#x27;s hard to frame everyone in the shot since they don&#x27;t know exactly where the viewer will be looking, or the sound mixer telling you it&#x27;s hard to balance dialog and sound effects so everyone is audible without it being noticeable that they&#x27;re muting background audio. Or a recorder telling you that it&#x27;s hard to master a pop song given that everyone has different speakers and sound profiles on their headphones. Imagine you&#x27;re building a car and the designer tells you that it&#x27;s hard to make sure the controls can be reached by people who are different heights and weights.On one hand, yes it is; all of that stuff is very hard. On the other hand, yes, that is also the reason web UX designers and developers get paid money; because the job is hard and requires training and expertise, and designing a website interface requires more thought and intentionality and planning than is required to make a PDF. reply threatofrain 17 hours agorootparentprevSome designers can use Figma&#x27;s equivalent of grid and flexbox and some can&#x27;t.

If you only have room for content, it makes sense to tuck actions away into a hamburger menu except for a small number that you assign to tiny little hieroglyphs. Fine. However, if you have space, this is a terrible way to use it. At best it adds steps, at worst it invites experimentation and disaster to figure out what the heiroglyphs do (which wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if undo worked but we&#x27;ve apparently decided undo is fine to break too). Like the Apple HIGs used to say, on Desktop you should want to get the most common actions out of menus and onto labeled buttons so that users can answer \"what can I do?\" without playing hide and seek. Undo should be baked in from the very start (it&#x27;s hard to retrofit) to reduce the consequences of experimentation.Unfortunately mobile design has taken over so completely that even on apps which will be used almost entirely on desktop, even on apps with an internal advocate for Desktop design, UI designers go for the hamburgers and heiroglyphs and broken undo because it&#x27;s standard these days. Sigh.Oh, and modals are back with a vengeance, but I need to stop here or my blood pressure is going to get unhealthy. reply ndriscoll 18 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any excuse for hieroglyphs.

Hieroglyphs are a \"we hate our users and want them to know it\" first design.Hamburger menus could also frequently be done away with when you look at how many options they have.

Don&#x27;t be upset about the use of symbols instead of text, but about the use of bad symbols. Nobody needs the \"play\" button on a video widget to say \"play\" - they know what the right-facing triangle means.

But it’s ready to go if I add more routes. If the list grew to be too large, I would switch to a two-column layout on my homepage for the primary points of interest.I’m a big fan of collapsible table of contents. That design paradigm allows for the higher level to use a word to indicate what it contains and then can open up to a list. But it does really depend on the type of information conveyed. I can currently get away with always avoiding hamburger menus but that might be tougher for something like a banking app to avoid. reply donmcronald 14 hours agoparentprev> Hamburgers and Hieroglyphs!Hieroglyphs sums it up so nicely. Lol. I&#x27;ll also add hidden, context sensitive options to that list. I like having options that are disabled (aka greyed out) if they&#x27;re unusable because at least I can see there&#x27;s a possibility to do something if I get conditions right. Instead, modern designs will hide those options and, if you don&#x27;t know the magic conditions needed to expose them, you&#x27;ll never see them.An example of this is Ubiquiti with their Unifi stuff. If you go to manage switch ports, the page they give for that doesn&#x27;t have an option to \"Select All\" ports. You need to select at least one port first, and then the \"Select All\" option magically appears. So not only is it hidden, it gets the context wrong. Think of having it as a disabled checkbox. Everyone would immediately realize the context is wrong because having the \"Select All\" checkbox disabled when no ports are selected would be obviously dumb. reply pdntspa 16 hours agoparentprevI think the biggest opponent to what you&#x27;re advocating are new users, they are so easily intimidated by too many things on the screen.

It&#x27;s hard to believe that marketing pages, after decades of evolution and testing, haven&#x27;t landed on what users actually want, rather than what they say they want.Scrolling is such a natural behavior for internet natives. Being able to leverage a large screen to visually compare things has its place, but the article uses a horrible example:> Our condensed product page prototype took the same information from the original dispersed page and arranged it in a 2x2 grid that allowed users to compare multiple services simultaneously, without having to remember the details of each service.What&#x27;s to compare? They&#x27;re disparate services.I do like the example of the product specifications. But that was more of an objective usability issue: requiring more clicks for more information. reply crabmusket 9 hours agorootparent> Scrolling is such a natural behavior for internet natives.My jaw dropped at the participant who apparently saw the hero section of one of the pages, and thought that was the whole site. I get that scroll bars are invisible these days so you can&#x27;t immediately see the page height, but not even trying to scroll anyway is wild to me.But tons of users are not \"internet natives\". reply supriyo-biswas 6 hours agorootparentIt’s not at all uncommon.Scrollbars can show up at weird places and not do anything at all due to UI issues, and they’re not that visible anyway in proportion to the page contents, even if we are to assume Windows 95 style scroll bars. Therefore the only indication of whether a piece of content is scrollable is its layout, and a hero taking up the entire viewport height is next to impossible to understand.This is the reason many such pages have a “Learn more” page whose only function is to scroll the page down by one viewport height, or less commonly a pulsating arrow at the bottom that tells the user the content is scrollable. reply josefresco 14 hours agoparentprevAnother web designer here: I agree. Notice how the screenshots are \"zoomed out\" which makes the multi column look rich and more visually appealing. While I&#x27;m all for using the horizontal space available to you, everything we&#x27;re taught about \"call to action\" leads to single element design. reply strangescript 18 hours agoprevWhat you really want is two apps, completely different UX&#x27;s and its not worth the effort more times than not.

For example having every network participant relay some internal traffic, instead of relying on altruism from relay operators, makes it much harder for a single entity to control enough hops to deanonymize users.Sadly, outside of torrenting I2P doesn&#x27;t seem to have much traction, losing out to the better funded tor project reply bilegeek 17 hours agoparentTorrenting is I2P&#x27;s foot in the door for much wider adoption, which would help drive other types of usage. I really hope it takes off, especially since qBitTorrent 4.6 just integrated support; the current stagnation of filesharing, especially w.r.t. needing a VPN for everything, needs some shaking up. reply birdyrooster 15 hours agorootparentWe will still need VPNs to get good connectivity to other residential ISPs until some government entity (or market condition) inspires ISPs to invest in more hardware and peering with each other.

The Tor Project has its reasons for not doing this (from https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.torproject.org&#x2F;alternate-designs&#x2F;):\"...many Tor users cannot be good relays — for example, some Tor clients operate from behind restrictive firewalls, connect via modem, or otherwise aren&#x27;t in a position where they can relay traffic.

These clogging attacks are not that scary in the Tor context so long as relays are never clients too...\" reply miohtama 9 hours agorootparentOriginally Skype and Spotify had their own peer-to-peer networks and distribution.Both stopped using them because it worked so badly. reply jchw 9 hours agorootparentFor a long time Skype&#x27;s P2P architecture worked great. It was the absolute best A&#x2F;V calling experience, handily beating every other contemporary mainstream offer from MSN to Y!IM. It had issues such as getting crushed by patch Tuesday, and I assume it was likely not robust enough to adversaries, but one thing you can&#x27;t say about Skype was that its P2P architecture didn&#x27;t work. It absolutely did.I think even though there were many things that could&#x27;ve lead to the demise of Skype&#x27;s P2P network, it was pretty undoubtedly the rise of mobile phones. Android or iOS, Skype was just dreadful; they were clearly ducktaping mobile support in. Sometimes you&#x27;d be sending messages and everything would appear to be working, little did you know the other person was responding but you weren&#x27;t actually seeing anything. Push notifications? Sometimes you get them, but it was a crapshoot as to when you would get them. It probably was expensive to try to bridge their P2P network to mobile phones, and it definitely didn&#x27;t work very well.I guess anyone can just say these things and it&#x27;s really difficult to back them up since a large part of it is subjective (and aside from some reverse engineering efforts, I am not really intimately familiar with much of the details behind Skype and its transition off of P2P) but I think there is one thing that most people would definitely not disagree with: Skype was far more relevant and well-regarded when it was peer to peer. That&#x27;s not to say that the move off had anything to do with its downfall, more just to say that if it was so awful, I think it would&#x27;ve been the other way around. reply zx8080 9 hours agorootparentprev> it worked so badly.Skype has a much worse quality now after the switch for all people I know who used Skype at the time.The real reason for switching was iPhone. First, Apple did not allow long-running apps in favour of centralized notifications. Periodically start Skype to check events did not help recwicing calls. Second, users moved to smartphones, which depleted the active nodes network. So there has been an increase of short-lived nodes without balanced increase in long-lived. So to prevent the p2p network model to start failing, Skype moved to a centralized one. And probably the government regulations (to store and decrypt messages) took place, but this was probably not very public. reply imglorp 7 hours agorootparentMicrosoft buying Skype must have added additional incentives to centralize.

I remember reading something about how a large part of them were controlled by US intel. reply j45 10 hours agorootparentprevNot often a network protocol &#x2F; communication thread breaks outNeat point. I wonder if the percentage of bandwidth shared could be relative to the speed or openness of network available? reply warner25 7 hours agorootparentI think it would be exactly like that, because that&#x27;s how it already works for relays. The Tor Project operates a measurement system that tests relays in various ways and records their status in the public consensus document. Clients then use weighted random selection (along with some screening criteria) to choose relays in proportion to how much bandwidth they provide, according to the consensus. reply nine_k 8 hours agorootparentprevTor was invented with a purpose of giving users with poor, restricted connections to access forbidden stuff untracked.

An I2P node might be run by an individual who lacks that security, and this is just something that can be used against that person if he comes to the attention of the authorities for whatever reason. It’s like the risks of individuals’ running Tor exit nodes, which are well known. reply heavyset_go 3 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s the same risk as running a Tor exit node: you getting arrested, having all of your electronics confiscated and facing life ruining charges because someone was caught downloading illegal content from IP addresses that point to your servers.Even if charges get dropped, or you win in court, that&#x27;s quite a burden. reply mistercheph 11 hours agorootparentprevDoes any transmission method where the message is even partially concealed from the messenger not spark the same concern?

For many people in oppressive states who rely on censorship-resistant and privacy-guaranteeing software, being a dissident isn’t necessarily about defending minorities or trying to make the world a better place. It’s often about retreating into a private world with your fellows and trying to live your life as best you can under the circumstances. So, IMO it’s better not to specify any specific social-justice goals for projects like these. reply schleck8 2 hours agorootparentSeems like you&#x27;d agree with their ideals then though reply corbezzoli 28 minutes agorootparentPrivately agreeing might be preferable in countries where these projects are useful. reply OfSanguineFire 19 minutes agorootparentOr not even agreeing. It has been fairly common for dissidents in the USSR and Putin’s Russia to express outright scorn for people who advocate for social justice, especially LGBT whom even dissidents might dislike. Social-justice advocates are seen as naive dreamers. Also, while people who support the regime are odious, those who actively work against it might be accused of allying with the country’s enemies.As I said, the favoured course of action for some dissident communities is instead retreating into the private sphere and trying to live one’s best life there.

Enjoy! What if I told you that it could takes just few lines of code to create graphics as simple as gradients or as complex as rain effects? Welcome to the world of shaders! I’ve been fascinated by shaders for a couple of years. but each time I attempted to dive into the subject, I felt like I was learning to read and write all over again — it was overwhelming. When I transitioned this website to Svelte, I saw an opportunity to replace a simple CSS animation on my homepage with a shader-based animation. The original CSS animation manipulated the border-radius property to produce a calm and minimalist animation, illustrated below. You might wonder why I would bother re-doing something that already exists. Well, it’s because the simplicity of the task seemed like the perfect stepping stone—challenging, yet manageable. Plus, having recently defended my PhD, I finally had the time to delve into this passion project! I hear about shaders all the time, when scrolling generative artists on twitter X, when I want to change the look of Minecraft, or even when I want to train an AI (CUDA is basically an API for shaders). So now it’s the time to demystify this damn thing and start writing one of my own! In this article, you’ll join me on my journey as we explore the world of fragment shaders, making it as approachable as possible for a beginner with basic understanding in programing. For anyone looking for an in-depth introduction to shaders, I highly recommend The Book of Shaders Shaders: the good, the bad and the ugly If you’re into video games, you’ve likely heard of shaders. They’re the magic behind enhancing lighting, conjuring up special effects, and even generating cartoonish looks (yes, that’s why there’s a ‘shade’ in ‘cel shading’). In a way, shaders is what makes modern games look so good when compared to their ’90s counterparts. But what exactly is a shader? Let’s start simple: A shader is a small program running on your GPU that takes, at the very least, pixel coordinates as input and spits out a color as output. The reason why they are so popular in video games and computer graphics is that they are extremly fast. Their secret sauce? Parallelization. These programs are designed to work on multiple pixels at the same time, making them ridiculously efficient. The CPU, smart but slow The GPU, dumb and fast Side Note: Shaders come in different dialects. For this article, I’ll focus on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), mainly because it’s browser-friendly! This incredible power comes, however, at some costs: Shaders have to be compact and low-level. This means you can’t lean on high-level abstractions or import libraries to do the heavy lifting (* laugh in javascript *). Moreover, their parallel nature makes them memoryless and stateless. This translates to: “You can’t store or share data between pixels or shader executions.” These constraints make shaders a tough nut to crack, especially if you’ve been pampered by high-level languages (guilty as charged). Coordinates is All You Need Shaders transform pixel coordinates into colors, encoded in RGBA—each channel ranging from 0 to 1. (It is also possible to manipulate vertex positions, but this topic is left as an exercise to the reader). Typically, coordinates are normalized between 0 and 1. In this coordinate space, (0, 0) is the lower left corner, and (1, 1) is the upper right. These coordinates are commonly referred to as st or uv by convention. Now, let’s imagine you want to write the simplest shader: a gradient where the red component increases from left to right and the green component ascends from bottom to top. That is, find the function f(x,y) in the following illustration: (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1) =f(0.19,0.12) Sure, it might appear too basic, but think of it as a prime playground to get cozy with shader syntax. Go ahead, check out the implementation below and tinker with it -— how about changing the gradient from black to blue? Code show/hide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ⌄ varying vec2 vUv; void main() { // Normalized pixel coordinates (from 0 to 1) vec2 st = vUv; // redish in x, greenish in y // Try to modify the following line to have a blue gradient // from left to right. gl_FragColor = vec4(st.x, st.y, 0.0, 1.0); // RGBA } A shader. Impressive? Hint There are a few interesting things to note here about the syntax: Inputs: We can declare input to the shaders that can be varying or uniform. Varying variables are different for each pixel, while uniform variables are the same for all pixels. Here, we declare a varying variable vUv, which is a 2D vector representing the position of the pixel on a plane. It is declared as varying because the value is different for each pixel on the screen. Coordinates Origin: Take note, the origin of UV space is at the lower-left corner. If you’re used to SVG or HTML canvas, this might feel like driving on the other side of the road. Built-in types: Just like C, shaders demand type declaration. You’ll come across a range of types suited for vectors and matrices—think vec2, vec3, vec4, mat2, mat3, and the list goes on. Swizzling: Accessing elements of a vector? Easy, just use the dot notation (vec2(1, 2).x gives you 1). Want to slice and dice your vector? Use the xy notation (vec4(1, 2, 3, 4).xy returns vec2(1, 2)). If you’re working with colors, feel free to use the myvector.rgba syntax — This is entirely up to you. Output: There’s no return statement. The color for each pixel is determined by the value of gl_FragColo at the end of the main() function. So even with our super simple example, you can already feel the power of shaders. Without it, an equivalent result would have required a loop over all the pixels of the canvas — 90000 in this case — just to create this gradient. But this is just the beginning; shaders could do so much more than that. One Step() Beyond Now, to reproduce my original animation, I need to draw shapes with salient edges. While this may seem trivial, it is not. Forget about a handy drawCircle() function. Instead, we turn to our ever-reliable friends: math and trigonometry. To create something like a disk, consider each pixel’s distance to the disk’s center. This distance calculation could be done using the Pythagorean theorem, however, we also have a built-in function for that: distance(vec2 p1, vec2 p2). If you map this distance to the color of the pixel, you will get a circular gradient. But wait, you may anticipate, “a gradient is not a solid disk!” And you’d be right. The secret sauce for that is another built-in function: step(float threshold, float value). The step() function takes in the distance and sharply transitions it into either 0 or 1, depending on whether the distance crosses a certain threshold. Code show/hide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ⌄ uniform float u_slider; varying vec2 vUv; void main() { vec2 st = vUv; // Distance of the current pixel to the center of the canvas float d = distance(st, vec2(0.5)); // Using step to get a sharp circle // s = 1 if d > 0.25, 0 otherwise float s = step(0.25, d); // Mix the two colors based on the slider // color = u_slider * s + (1-u_slider) * d float brightness = mix(d, s, u_slider); gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(brightness), 1.0); } Distance from (0.5,0.5) Slide to the right to apply the step() functionNoticed those jagged edges, also known as aliasing, around the disk when applying step()? That’s because the transition from 0 to 1 is a bit too abrupt. The solution is another built-in function called smoothstep(float t_start, float t_end, float x), which—as you might guess—smooths things out. You may find it initially challenging, but this method of shaping with distance is your Swiss Army knife for crafting the mind-blowing shaders you often stumble upon online. So let’s dive a bit deeper into it! Signed Distance Functions (SDF) When you think of shapes, it’s natural to imagine them as a series of connected points. But here’s a twist: you can also represent shapes in terms of their distance to other points in space. This is where Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) come into play. Why “signed,” you ask? The distance is signed because it can be negative if the point is inside the shape. To start off, let’s revisit the circle we created earlier and adapt it using SDFs. The key is to determine a function that calculates the distance from any given point in space to our circle. Starting simply, let’s find the distance to the origin. In the image below, it becomes evident that the distance d from the origin to the circle is essentially the distance from the origin to the center of the circle C minus the radius r. d (0,0) (1,0) (0,1) (1,1) r C v This observation translates beautifully into a function: float circleSDF(vec2 p, float r) { return length(p) - r; } You can interpret this function in two ways. It either measures the distance from a point p to a circle centered at the origin, or the distance from the origin to the circle itself. It’s all a matter of perspective! However, we’re rarely interested in just the distance to the origin. We want the distance to any point in the UV space. To achieve this, we merely translate the point p by the pixel’s position uv. The SDF function then returns negative distances for pixels inside the circle and positive distances for those outside. These two realms are separated by the circle, where the distance is exactly zero. What about shading this SDF to make it visually compelling? Simple. Apply the 1. - step() function to the distance. The pixels with negative distances (inside the circle) take the value 1, and those outside take the value 0. Code show/hide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 ⌄ ⌄ ⌄ varying vec2 vUv; uniform float u_slider; float circleSDF(vec2 p, float r) { return length(p) - r; } void main() { vec2 uv = vUv; // Signed distance to a circle centered at (0.5, 0.5) float d = circleSDF(vec2(0.5) - uv, u_slider); // Default color to orange vec3 color = vec3(1.0, 0.6, 0.2); // Teal if inside the circle if (da∨b Slide to apply min() of the two SDFsHave you noticed that I used 1.-smoothstep()? This is because step() (and smoothstep()) outputs 1 when the distance is above the threshold (i.e outside the disk). To get a positive value inside the shape, we need to invert the output. Complex shapes — like a blob! — are thus the combination of many simple SDFs. Like legos, you have many simple SDFs (building blocks) that can be combined to any shape you want. That said, a blob is smooth and jelly-like, unlike the sharp angle at the junction of our two disks. Luckily, SDFs have one last magic property for us. Smooth operator To create an appealing effect, we would like the shapes to blend smoothly together like in a lava lamp. However, the min() function is not smooth, it has sharp discontinuites when it transitions between two distances. Instead, we would prefer a function that smoothly shift from one distance to another. Luckily, this problem has already been solved and is unoriginally called smooth minimum. The function takes an additional argument to control the smoothing strengh (often denoted k). Code show/hide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 ⌄ ⌄ ⌄ varying vec2 vUv; uniform float u_slider; float circleSDF(vec2 p, float r) { return length(p) - r; } // Polynomial smooth min float smin(float a, float b, float k) { float h = max( k-abs(a-b), 0.0 )/k; return min( a, b ) - h*h*k*(1.0/4.0); } void main() { vec2 uv = vUv; // The SDF for each disk float d1 = circleSDF(vec2(0.65) - uv, 0.2); float d2 = circleSDF(vec2(0.35) - uv, 0.2); // Union of disks float d = 1. - smoothstep(0., 0.01, smin(d1, d2, u_slider/3.+0.001)); gl_FragColor = vec4(vec3(d), 1.0); } Satisfying blending? Slide to increase the smoothing factorI Like to Move it We can pass any arbitrary variable to our shader, much like the slider you’ve played with in this article. To get closer to our goal, we need to animate the circles. Doing so is as simple as feeding the shader with a time uniform that can then be used to defin the circles’ positions. Here I generate my time uniform u_time through javascript and then use it as an input in my shader to control my SDFs. The shader will refresh 60 times per second by default, each time with a new u_time value, creating a smooth animation. With a few extra balls and a bit of parameter tweeking, we end up with a cute blobby shape. To make the blob oscillating, we can use periodic functions (e.g. sin,cos) to control each balls. A metaball is a combination of multiple SDFs, to clean up our code, we can use a loop to combine them together, instead of manually updating the final distance variable like in our previous exemple. To further speed-up the process, we first define the centers of each balls, and then store it in an array that can be easily accessed in the loop to iteratively update the distance value. Pay attention to lines 40-43 in the code below. Code show/hide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 ⌄ ⌄ ⌄ ⌄ uniform float u_time; varying vec2 vUv; uniform float u_slider; // C-style macro to define constants #define K 0.4 float circleSDF(vec2 uv, vec2 p, float r) { return length(p-uv) - r; } float smin(float a, float b, float k) { float h = max( k-abs(a-b), 0.0 )/k; return min( a, b ) - h*h*k*(1.0/4.0); } // Map a value from -1 to 1 to out_min to out_max float trigmap(float x, float out_min, float out_max) { return out_min + (x + 1.) * (out_max - out_min) / (2.); } void main() { vec2 uv = vUv; // Define the center of each metaball vec2 c1 = vec2(0.4,trigmap(cos(u_time), 0.3, 0.4)); vec2 c2 = vec2(trigmap(sin(u_time), 0.4, 0.7), 0.5); vec2 c3 = vec2(0.5, trigmap(cos(u_time), 0.6, 0.7)); vec2 c4 = vec2(trigmap(cos(u_time), 0.4, 0.63), 0.3); // Store the centers in an array vec2 centers[4] = vec2[4](c1,c2,c3,c4); // Initialize the distance and define the smoothing factor It's a blob! Adjust the size of the metaballs And voila, our baby’s born. You should now be ready to write some shaders of your own. If writing code is not your thing, you now have a better understanding of what’s going under the hood of node-based editor in Blender’s shader nodes or Unity’s Shader Graph. This sad monochrome blob is functional but boring. Let’s make it juicer! The Final Touch To truly appreciate the magic of shaders, there’s nothing like taking the wheel and manipulating the blob in real-time. This final section will guide you on how to introduce user interactivity into your shader. Essentially, you will learn how to let users control the position of a ball within the blob by using their mouse. First things first: We’ll use the mouse coordinates as a uniform input into the shader. This will allow real-time interaction with our creation. 1 uniform vec2 u_mouse; Once the mouse coordinates are received, adding them to the array of ball centers will allow the user to interactively control a ball. As you see, it only takes one line of code to create interactivity! 1 vec2 centers[5] = vec2[5](c1,c2,c3,c4,u_mouse); Next, it’s just fun and iterations. To get to the final result, I extensively use the mix(colorA, colorB, percent) function. It’s equivalent to if/else blocks when percent is a boolean. For example, to get red outside the metaball (where metaball == 0) and green within it, you can write. 1 2 3 4 vec3 color = mix( vec3(1., 0., 0.), // Red vec3(0., 1., 0.), // Green metaball) Finally, we get this beauty Code show/hide That concludes this introduction. I’m glad I’ve finally learned to write shaders! This article barely scratches the surface of the basics, but there’s no reason to be afraid anymore—neither for you nor for me. Stay tuned for future articles where we’ll explore how to elevate this blob into the third dimension. In the meantime, feel free to experiment; you can change the color scheme or tweak the positions of the balls. For updates, you can follow me on Twitter.

For an intro however, I think it&#x27;s simpler to assume no memory nor shared state. reply nwoli 1 hour agorootparentprevYou can set up shaders to access a shared global texture (and write to it). It’s more expensive and a bit to set up so it’s not totally true, but it’s a good first mental model reply bsder 4 hours agoprevThe article is quite nice. However, it glosses over the primary problem with shaders.A shader is a pain in the ass that most programs and applications don&#x27;t want.3D stuff likes triangles and the GPUs are happy to slot into that abstraction. Shaders are useful to interpolate over those triangles.Triangles are mostly garbage for everybody else. 2D rendering wants paths. Font rendering wants paths or pixmaps. GUI&#x27;s would work much better with paths and pixmaps. Compositors really want pixmaps. Video decoders really want pixmaps and parallel rendering.What everybody non-3D wants is rectangular pixmaps and access to computation directly to those pixmaps. And GPUs don&#x27;t like this very much, and shaders don&#x27;t map very well to this. reply moonchild 47 minutes agoparentHaving written a 2-d curve renderer, what I want is parallel compute and high bandwidth; gpus deliver. (Especially with newer interfaces that support scatter-write; not sure how much penetration these have in the browser yet.) It&#x27;s true this is not what you want at a higher level, but it serves as a fine base to implement higher-level abstractions. You could support them in hardware, but it&#x27;s not at all obvious what the advantages would be; no one complains that cpus don&#x27;t have architectural support for for-loops.Edit: upon a reread, I don&#x27;t really understand what your problem is with gpus. You can ignore the vertex processing pipeline entirely, drawing just a single fullscreen quad (or use a compute shader); the gpu will handle this with aplomb, and this is the sort of thing the linked article is talking about too. reply persnickety 2 hours agoparentprevWhat part of a pixel&#x2F;fragment shader does not map very well to pixmaps? reply bsder 1 hour agorootparentOnly interpolating based on the edge? Needing to carefully map float coordinates so you don&#x27;t wind up with fractional pixels mapping incorrectly? Inability to look at pixels to each side to compute something?You can work around the limitations in vertex or fragment shaders, but, in many cases, you&#x27;re having to unwind a lot of what the vertex and fragment processing does.On of my favorite examples is drawing a screen&#x2F;pixel-space rectangle and then drawing a border of the rectangle in a different color and specifying the number of pixels that border should be wide. Oof. You have to specify 4 triangles, make sure they don&#x27;t overlap, specify them in a particular vertex order or annotate them with extra data so you only draw one of the three edges, make sure that you only draw each pixel just once or your blending goes all to crap, etc. Whereas, you can divide the rectangle into chunks, send each chunk through the compute pipeline, and it&#x27;s stupidly straightforward.Or, if you want simpler, just draw a line n pixels wide. If you don&#x27;t have an explicit extension to do this, it&#x27;s really a pain.2D graphics simply wants very different graphic and computational primitives compared to 3D. reply persnickety 8 minutes agorootparentInterpolation works on neighboring pixels though? Not sure what you mean there. Looking at neighboring pixels of the input pixmap is trivial as well.The fractional pixel mappings do get you - but I think I recall an integer mode somewhere in GLSL 3.2.Your example steps outside the shader boundary, though. If you try to use triangles to draw pixmap, of course you&#x27;ll have trouble. That&#x27;s why pixel shaders are the right tool for the job.The only disadvantage they have is that the pixmaps are immutable within a single pass, so you can&#x27;t (easily) draw the border together with the inner rectangle in one pass. But if you&#x27;re used to functional programming, you won&#x27;t even notice this.I agree that shaders are not the right thing when you need mutability, as you seem to, but working with 2D graphics doesn&#x27;t necessarily require mutability. reply antoineMoPa 7 hours agoprevBeautiful, thanks for posting! reply kwoff 6 hours agoprev [–] Good job on a really good intro replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Photograph: Antiquity Archaeology Cold war satellite images reveal hundreds of unknown Roman forts Declassified spy images point to 396 undiscovered forts in Syria and Iraq, shifting understanding of Roman frontier Caroline Davies Thu 26 Oct 2023 00.00 EDT Declassified cold-war spy satellite images have thrown new light on the workings of the Roman empire by revealing hundreds of previously undiscovered forts, with dramatic implications for our understanding, experts have said. Archaeologists examining aerial photographs taken in the 1960s and 70s said they reveal 396 sites of unknown Roman forts in Syria and Iraq across the Syrian steppe. The findings, published today in Antiquity, an international archeology academic journal, have now forced a re-evaluation of life at the Roman frontier. A previous survey of the region in 1934 by Antoine Poidebard, a French Jesuit explorer who pioneered aerial archeology in the Middle East from his bi-plane, recorded a line of 116 forts. Until now, historians assumed these forts were part of a defensive line built to protect the eastern province of the empire from Arab and Persian incursions, and from nomadic marauding tribes intent on captive-taking and slave-raiding. The new discoveries instead point to the frontier being more fluid and a vibrant place of cross-border trade, rather than of constant violent conflict, the authors said, with the forts supporting a system of caravan-based interregional trade, communication and military transport. The authors said it now raises the question: “Was it a wall or a road?” “Since the 1930s, historians and archeologists have debated the strategic or political purpose of this system of fortifications,” said the lead author of the research, Prof Jesse Casana, of Dartmouth college in New Hampshire, US. “But few scholars have questioned Poidebard’s basic observation that there was a line of forts defining the eastern Roman frontier.” The 396 new sites, hidden by modern-day development, are widely distributed across the region from east to west, which does not support the argument that the forts constituted a north-south border wall. Researchers now hypothesise that the forts were constructed to support cross-border trade, protecting caravans travelling between the eastern provinces and the non-Roman territories, as well as facilitating communications between east and west. Significantly, this indicates that the borders of the Roman world were less rigidly defined and exclusionist than previously believed, said the authors. The Romans were a military society, but they clearly valued trade and communication with regions not under their direct control, they added. The images studied formed part of the world’s first spy-satellite programme conducted at the time of geopolitical tension between the US and Soviet Union and their allies, the western bloc and the eastern bloc. They “preserve a high-resolution, stereo perspective on a landscape that has been severely impacted by modern-day land-use change,” said Casana. He said it revealed the real value of satellite imagery for recording archeological features before they are lost. “We were only able confidently to identify extant archeological remains of 38 of Poidebard’s 116 forts. In addition, many of the likely Roman forts we have documented in this study have already been destroyed by recent urban or agricultural development, and countless others are under extreme threat.” As more imagery is declassified, such as U2 spy plane photographs, more new archeological discoveries will be able to be made. Casana said “careful analysis of these powerful data holds enormous potential for future discoveries in the near east and beyond”.

What has survived from previous times is more or less by accident (too bulky, too hidden etc.)The idea of trying to preserve historical artifacts seems to be entirely modern, but even that concept has evolved alot.

For example, city walls of Moscow were started to be dismantled in 19th century and whatever left was destroyed by the communists after revolution. To widen the roads in the center of the city the communists demolished 18th and 19th century historical buildings (luckily some other buildings were just moved away using rails).Also new construction sometimes happens in the center and you cannot build something new without destroying a part of history first. reply kortilla 16 hours agorootparentprevYes.

Now, a study from Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, shows that more than three-quarters of all ipê from the top producing region in Brazil could have been harvested illegally. \"The study reveals where in the chain the greatest risks lie. It can be a tool to counteract illegal logging,\" says Caroline S.S. Franca, PhD student at Chalmers. Ipê is one of the world's hardest woods. It is therefore particularly suitable for building balconies, conservatories, stairs or piers. Demand for the exclusive, tropical wood has increased steadily in recent years, especially on European, American and Canadian markets. In Brazil, the country of origin for 96 percent of all ipê on the market, exports have increased by over 76 percent in volume over the past decade. This development means an increased risk of illegal logging of ipê, which in November 2022 was included on the Cites list of species threatened by overexploitation due to its popularity and increasing demand through international trade. \"Some products from the rainforest are more valuable and therefore more vulnerable to illegal logging. Ipê is at the top of that list. At the same time, ipê trees grow slowly, which means that regrowth takes a long time. The risk of extinction is real, and today there are no reliable figures on the amount of remaining trees and the damage to existing stands that has already been done,\" says Caroline S.S. Franca, PhD student in Physical Resource Theory at Chalmers. Mapping where risks are greatest Caroline S.S. Franca is the lead author of a research study on the risks for illegal logging of ipê in Brazil, which was recently published in Nature Sustainability. In the study, the researchers analysed extensive amounts of data to identify where in the supply chains there are significant risks that logging has taken place illegally. The conclusion is that more than three-quarters of all ipê from Pará—the top producing state of this wood in Brazil and a major source of exports—in the period 2009-2019 may have been illegally harvested. \"In the study, we see, for example, that 16 percent of the ipê that ends up on the market is harvested without proper permits, and that landowners claim that they have felled more ipê on their land than is likely to exist on the stated area. We also show that there is more wood in circulation than the official production figures indicate,\" she says. Paving the way for better enforcement and practices “We know that illegal logging is driving forest degradation, and is linked to organised crime, conflict and the destruction of forest-dependent local communities,” continues Caroline S.S. Franca, adding that “degradation of Amazon forests does not only affect the local environment and the ecological diversity of the rainforest, it is also as large of a contributor to climate change as outright deforestation.” She hopes that her research results can contribute to an increased awareness of the extent of illegal logging among decision-makers and actors in the supply chain, as well as among consumers. “The novel methods developed in the study, exploring existing patterns in the data for transactions and approvals of ipê exploration have an enormous potential both to improve forest control systems in Brazil, as well as to support supply-chain actors in their efforts to make timber sourcing more responsible and sustainable,\" says Marco Lentini, a co-author of the study with a long-standing experience working on sustainable forest management in the Brazilian Amazon. The information already exists, now there is political will to use it Recent numbers form Brazil’s forest monitoring system shows that deforestation in the Amazon have been almost halved in 2023, compared to last year. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva also initiated the so-called Belém Declaration—an alliance among eight South American countries to combat the deforestation of the Amazon, adopted on August 8, 2023. \"This declaration is a welcome expression of renewed political will to reduce deforestation,\" comments Martin Persson, co-author of the ipê study and a Chalmers researcher with extensive experience of research on the devastation of the Amazon. But he also emphasises that the danger is far from over, and that the declaration itself will not lead to change. “Halting deforestation and forest degradation requires concrete policy measures. And what we point out in our study is that there is already data and information that can be used by authorities to get to those who harvest forests illegally,\" he says. Important for consumers to ask questions There is a certification for sustainably produced wood, FSC, which can serve as a guide for consumers who want to avoid buying non-sustainable or illegally harvested wood. But regardless of whether the wood has an FSC certification or not, Caroline S.S. Franca emphasises that it is always important to ask a few basic questions before buying. \"Where exactly does the wood come from? Is there documentation of the origin of the wood and its path through the production chain? As a consumer, you have a greater opportunity to make an informed decision if you get answers to those questions,\" she says. Image collage by Chalmers.

More about the scientific study The scientific article Quantifying timber illegality risk in the Brazilian forest frontier has been published in Nature Sustainability. It is written by Caroline S.S. Franca and Martin Persson at Chalmers University of Technology, Tomás Carvalho at the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and Marco Lentini at the Instituto de Manejo e Certificação Florestal e Agrícola (IMAFLORA) in Brazil. More about the ipê market Brazil is the country of origin for 96 percent of all ipê on the market. Brazil's exports of ipê have increased by over 76 percent in volume between the period 2010 – 2021. 85 percent of the demand for ipê comes from European, American and Canadian markets. 45% of exports go to Europe. Since 2017, at least 525,000 tonnes, or 470,000 cubic metres of ipê, have been exported from Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Peru. At least two-thirds of the species exported as ipê from the Amazon region in 2017-2021 are on the IUCN list of species threatened with extinction. Ipê is also on the list of species threatened by overexploitation due to international trade. Source: Demand for luxury decks in Europe and North America is pushing ipê to the brink of extinction across the Amazon basin and threatening the forest front frontier. Report from March 2022 by Marigold Norman and Alfredo Rodriguez Zunino, within the Forest Policy Trade and Finance Initiative. More about deforestation and forest degradation Deforestation is the cutting down of forests to make way for other purposes. In the Amazon, deforestation is often driven by the conversion of rainforest to pasture or arable land. Forest degradation - steadily driven by timber production as well as other drivers - is a more gradual process in which unsustainable harvesting cause biodiversity to be lost and the forests' ability to produce timber and other benefits is reduced. More about FSC certification of timber FSC, the Forest Stewardship Council, works to ensure that the world's forests are managed more sustainably. With FSC-controlled wood, the risk of the wood coming from unacceptable sources, such as illegally harvested wood or wood from forests with endangered high conservation values, is limited.

This limits their lifespan, from 100+ years of full hardwood flooring to “only” a 30-40 years for laminate.Vinyl, on the other hand, is completely different, and is unlikely to survive daily use in serviceable state for more than 20 years, typically even less than that. reply mschulkind 14 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;re confusing terminology here.

It requires less hardwood (rare) for the veneer, and uses softwood (plentiful) for the plywood base. 2. It can be milled exactly to one thickness. Generally with solid hardwood floors you need to sand after installing to get everything into one plane due to moisture movement in the hardwood warping and twisting it. 3. It can be applied in wider planks. Wide solid hardwood floors tend to cup and contract and leave gaps after installation.

They reformulated the treating agent in 2004 so it&#x27;s no longer using arsenic, and since then pressure treated wood just doesn&#x27;t last as long.

This submission was accepted, meaning that the international trade in these woods will be subject to strict controls as of 25 November 2024. Any international trade must be accompanied by an export permit issued by a national Management Authority, certifying that the wood was harvested in a manner that is compatible with the long-term survival of the species.CITES enforcement is no joke and the listing of Ipe in Appendix II is likely to hugely reduce demand, due to the substantial bureaucratic burden and legal risk that importers will be exposed to. Guitarists will be all too familiar with the impact of CITES, following the listing of Rosewood in Appendix II in 2017. Until an exemption for musical instruments was negotiated in 2019, guitars with rosewood fingerboards practically disappeared from the market - the risks for importers and distributors were simply too great to reasonably manage.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cites.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;eng&#x2F;cop&#x2F;19&#x2F;prop&#x2F;as_rec...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cites.org&#x2F;eng&#x2F;app&#x2F;appendices.php reply pvaldes 13 hours agoparentAs botanical footnote: All this trees called lapachos are in the Bignoniaceae family.

The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending. While the report could give the Fed some impetus to keep policy tight, traders were still pricing in no chance of an interest rate hike when the central bank meets next week. WATCH NOW VIDEO03:44 U.S. GDP grew at a 4.9% annual pace in the third quarter, better than expected The U.S. economy grew even faster than expected in the third quarter, buoyed by a strong consumer in spite of higher interest rates, ongoing inflation pressures, and a variety of other domestic and global headwinds. Gross domestic product, a measure of all goods and services produced in the U.S., rose at a seasonally adjusted 4.9% annualized pace in the July-through-September period, up from an unrevised 2.1% pace in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a 4.7% acceleration in real GDP, which also is adjusted for inflation. The sharp increase came due to contributions from consumer spending, increased inventories, exports, residential investment and government spending. Consumer spending, as measured by personal consumption expenditures, increased 4% for the quarter after rising just 0.8% in Q2, and was responsible for 2.7 percentage points of the total GDP increase. Inventories contributed 1.3 percentage points. Gross private domestic investment surged 8.4% and government spending and investment jumped 4.6%. Spending at the consumer level split fairly evenly between goods and services, with the two measures up 4.8% and 3.6%, respectively. The GDP increase marked the biggest gain since the fourth quarter of 2021. Markets reacted little to the news, with stocks mixed in early trading and Treasury yields mostly lower. “This report confirmed what we already knew: The consumer went on a shopping spree in the third quarter,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for U.S. SPDR Business at State Street Global Advisors. “I don’t think anything in this report changes the outlook for monetary policy. That’s why I don’t think you’re seeing an overreaction from markets.” While the report could give the Federal Reserve some impetus to keep policy tight, traders were still pricing in no chance of an interest rate hike when the central bank meets next week, according to CME Group data. Futures pricing pointed to just a 27% chance of an increase at the December meeting following the GDP release. “Investors should not be surprised that the consumer was spending in the final months of the summer,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “The real question is if the trend can continue in the coming quarters, and we think not.” In other economic news Thursday, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims totaled 210,000 for the week ended Oct. 21, up 10,000 from the previous period and slightly ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 207,000. Also, durable goods orders increased 4.7% in September, well ahead of the 0.1% gain in August and the 2% forecast, according to the Commerce Department. Orders for durables, which include appliances, aircraft and electronics posted their biggest gain since July 2020. At a time when many economists had thought the U.S. would be in the midst of at least a shallow recession, growth has kept pace due to consumer spending that has exceeded all expectations. The consumer was responsible for about 68% of GDP in Q3. While the U.S. has proven resilient to the various challenges, most economists expect growth to slow considerably in the coming months. However, they generally think the U.S. can skirt a recession absent any other unforeseen shocks. WATCH NOW VIDEO04:00 Recessions always start with an economy that’s been booming, says Research Affiliates’ Rob Arnott “Going forward, the consumer’s not going to spend at the same rate, the government is not going to spend at the same rate, and businesses seem to be slowing down their spending as well,” Arone said. “This suggests this might be the peak GDP figure, at least in the next few quarters.” Even with Covid-era government transfer payments running out, spending has been strong as households draw down savings and ramp up credit card balances. The personal saving rate declined to 3.8% in the third quarter, compared to 5.2% in the previous period. Also, real after-tax income fell 1% in the quarter after increasing 3.5% in Q2. The GDP gains also come despite the Federal Reserve not only raising rates at the fastest clip since the early 1980s but also vowing to keep rates high until inflation comes back to acceptable levels. Price increases have been running well ahead of the central bank’s 2% annual target, though the rate of inflation at least has ebbed in recent months. The chain-weighted price index, which takes into accounts changes in consumer shopping patterns to gauge inflation, rose 3.5% for the quarter, up from 1.7% in Q2 and higher than the Dow Jones estimate for 2.5%. “The bottom line for the Federal Reserve is that no recession is in sight, and policymakers can be content in the knowledge that they can keep interest rates higher for longer, without triggering a meltdown in the U.S. economy,” said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at Ebury, a global financial services firm. “We don’t think that this impressive GDP data will be enough to encourage the Fed to deliver another rate increase, though we do at least believe that the first cut is a long way off.” Along with rates and inflation, consumers have been dealing with a variety of other issues. The resumption of student loan payments is expected to take a bite out of household budgets, while elevated gas prices and a wobbly stock market are hitting confidence levels. Geopolitical tensions also pose potential headaches, with fighting between Israel and Hamas and the war in Ukraine posing substantial uncertainties about the future.

However, I was just thinking this earlier that if you are a US Citizen, you already have so many advantages and opportunities that many don&#x27;t just because of that Passport. It is a great privilege especially as an Immigrant who became US citizens years ago. Not saying we are perfect obviously and just had a mass shooting earlier this AM (an unfortunate normal now) but if I had to choose a country to get ahead in life with the most opportunities possible as an immigrant, US is still the country to be at. Especially if you are entrepreneurial and want to control how you live your life. reply ChicagoBoy11 20 hours agoparentI&#x27;m an immigrant myself, and I share this sentiment deeply as well. The best description which I ever heard, curiously enough, was on a really old episode of this American life. My memory could be playing tricks on me, but I think it was some small story of folks doing car audio competitions, where the point was to build the car with the loudest possible speaker. It was absurd, silly, and for a nerd, obviously enthralling.But at some point, I don&#x27;t know if it is the narrator or someone in the story, but they say something to the effect of: \"Everyone wants to be king of the hill, but there aren&#x27;t enough hills to go around. The US is particularly great at creating more hills.\" reply zsmizzle 19 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thisamericanlife.org&#x2F;279&#x2F;transcript reply ChicagoBoy11 19 hours agorootparentHa, yeah, that&#x27;s it. And, the quote in question, from David Segal, apparently:\"Everyone wants to be the king of the hill. That&#x27;s international. But the number of aspiring kings always dwarfs the number of available hills. So in this country, we build more hills. We&#x27;re geniuses, in fact, at building more hills.\" reply dempedempe 18 hours agorootparentWhich is great until those hills directly or indirectly affect people&#x27;s health. Healthcare should not be a hill. Prisons should not be a hill. Politics should not be a hill. reply ativzzz 18 hours agorootparentPick your poison - would you rather have too many hills or not enough hills? Turns out limiting hill making is complex, and requires an even bigger hill that calls the shots reply Podgajski 18 hours agorootparentI would, in fact, rather, we had a flat landscape. reply ativzzz 17 hours agorootparentA flat landscape implies no opportunity for anyone to do anything. If you really want, go live in the wilderness on your own. That is the only true flat landscape reply Podgajski 17 hours agorootparentFlat landscape means no one rules over anyone else. I means you can give people authority but you can take away that authority without repercussions.If you want to live in a world subjected by a king or some fool on a hill, go ahead. I don’t pretend like you’re anything other than a peasant. reply ativzzz 16 hours agorootparent> no one rules over anyone elseThis is impossible, because in this scenario, someone will get weapons and will forcefully take over and rule everyone else. This is just how human nature works reply Podgajski 14 hours agorootparentWow, you have such a depressing take on human existence.I don’t see people getting weapons and taking over people in the streets, do you? reply Izkata 11 hours agorootparentYes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Capitol_Hill_Occupied_Protes... reply lazide 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause the cops or (worse case) the military will step in and stomp on them.In this context, good luck showing how they are anything but particularly well armed and organized gangs. reply satvikpendem 13 hours agorootparentprevWhy not? Lots of countries have gang problems, including the US. Countries are just the same issue, scaled up. reply waterheater 16 hours agorootparentprevYour system only works if everyone is uniform. Unless you strongly disincentivize or eliminate the desire to see over the heads of the crowd standing on the plain, a taller person will be able to see further than a shorter person. The shorter person, who happens to desire to see at least as far as the taller person, may then try to scoop some dirt into a pile to get their head above the crowd. Hills and valleys of all types will then be made by the taller person to preserve an unobstructed line of sight.The only way a person can absolutely reject authority is to live alone in wild territory (since managed territory is ruled by governing authorities). This scheme works until another person decides they want to live in the wilderness and happen to choose the exact same spot of woods as you, which is statistically probable since some geographic locations are more desirous than others. At that point, you will either find a way to coexist with this person or attempt to push them out. If you try to push them out, you&#x27;re saying you&#x27;re the ruler of the territory, so that option contradicts the objective of rejecting authority, for how can you say you reject authority and then become authority without being a hypocrite?So, the only viable option is to coexist. Over time, more people who reject authority arrive, and you must coexist with them or pack your bags for somewhere else, which you really don&#x27;t want to do. Presumably, you&#x27;ll work the land in some way to provide for your own sustenance. One day, your neighbor accuses you of killing their livestock overnight. You obviously didn&#x27;t, and you tell them that, but they just don&#x27;t believe you because they know they saw you on their land the previous night. At this point, you&#x27;re frustrated because you&#x27;re innocent but can&#x27;t demonstrate it, and the other people who reject authority like yourself are unable to decide who to listen to because neither one of you has more authority than the other. Someone comes up with the idea of writing down a common set of life principles and rules for dispute arbitration, so both legal and judicial systems are born. Down the line, someone decides to ignore the arbitration outcome, and the community decides that arbitration outcomes must be respected, so enforcement systems are created. At that point, everyone living in that spot of wild territory have created a government under the rule of law.The point of all this is, at some level, we are all ruled by something, be it a single human or a government. Are you primarily taking issue with monarchy? If so, absolute monarchy exists in only a handful of places in the world, with most monarchies being constitutional monarchies which delegate much political authority to democratically-elected individuals. And yes, some people like trusting that the rulers will do a good job. If that makes them peasants, so be it, but consider that even the people in the wilderness community must hope that their government under the rule of law will be successful. If they aren&#x27;t rooting for its success and actively work against it, the rule of law will eventually collapse. reply Podgajski 14 hours agorootparentIt is not about rejecting authority, it’s about being able to choose who has authority over you.You talk about absolute marquee like you don’t sell yourself to it every day when you walk into work. reply Podgajski 17 hours agorootparentprevI want to add as well, that you will all deride Elon Musk, but in secret you want to be Elon musk, you want to be that same person on top of the hill. So, even though you’re not him, you’re no better than him. reply VincentEvans 12 hours agorootparentThe fact that you are so sure of what you are saying here is a reflection of your own character. You are projecting.I am not the person you are replying to, but I assure you that “I” never wanted to be a on top of anything. I don’t want celebrity or wealth. I want to be left alone most of all, and having just enough to achieve it.Just telling you this so that your horizons of what people want open up a tad and you don’t assume that everyone around you is a different looking copy of you. reply ativzzz 16 hours agorootparentprev> I want to add as well, that you will all deride Elon Musk, but in secret you want to be Elon musk, you want to be that same person on top of the hill. So, even though you’re not him, you’re no better than him.Yes, this is what America is built on.

Those are the things I&#x27;m talking about. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentYou can, but these are complex systems, where some areas will have a profit incentive and be efficient, and others just mired in regulation, either directly or in a way that prevents competition arising.

They have problems but they too have a lot going for them.I guess it is possible that maybe in a generation or two Europe, Russia, China can fix their problems, get a solid working class and challenge the US.But it really feels like the entire planet is sinking right now and the US is the best of the worst.Maybe we need some aliens or something. reply rewmie 16 hours agorootparentprev> Because the US government has a money printer (...)I don&#x27;t think your non-sequitur bears even a passing resemblance to the subject.I think the whole point of the thread you&#x27;re replying on is mentioning the individualism and personal freedom that&#x27;s the US&#x27;s cultural basis, and that has a profound impact on the well-being of those who feel the need to be the best of what they do, regardless if what that might be.A while ago I stumbled upon an Instagram account of a middle-age man who had a bunch of videos of him juggling random stuff in his back yard, and he made it his point to stress that he was the best at what he did and he made a whole career out of it. Such a random thing, and I&#x27;m sure there weren&#x27;t that many competitors for the title of best pillow juggler, but that fit definitely the description of someone making his own hill to be its king. reply asow92 19 hours agoparentprevThe immigrants I know who become US citizens know this to be true. Many of natural born citizens I grew up with either aren&#x27;t aware of this reality or are misinformed about it. Many natural born US citizens don&#x27;t know what makes America so special.

For example, we aren&#x27;t going to wish away gun violence by ignoring it.The biggest current threat to the US isn&#x27;t this criticism, but rather the attack on its democratic foundations happening now. However even that is not coming from apathy, though its goals are very nihilistic in the short term and oligarchic and theocratic in the long term. reply andrewmutz 18 hours agorootparent> Instead, they are comparing it to other developed countries and focused on specific conditions that matter to them, like housing, transportation, environment, violence, etc.When I hear people complain online about the US, it is very common for them to have a deep understanding of problems in the US, but very superficial understanding of problems in other developed nations. European countries also have lots of problems with housing, healthcare, the environment, racism, the rise of the far right, etc. There are some problems that are uniquely american, like mass shootings.Being an informed citizen isn&#x27;t just understanding the problems in your country. If you wan&#x27;t to be a part of positive change, you need to understand what&#x27;s working and what&#x27;s not working in other comparable countries as well. reply nradov 17 hours agorootparentIndeed. It&#x27;s hilarious to see some Americans claiming things are so much better in \"Europe\" when their entire experience consists of a few weeks as a tourist or business traveler in first-tier EU cities.

There are booms and busts, but the recovery from the busts are always strong and do not stagnate for extended periods of time.I say this all as someone who does not live in the USA and is not an American citizen.The USA is not perfect and has its own share of social problems (like all countries do) but people decide that the tradeoff is worth it for all the good things the USA offers. reply danans 15 hours agorootparent> The USA is truly the land of opportunity.

EU member states don&#x27;t actually deport many undocumented immigrants regardless of what the official immigration laws say. replydanans 17 hours agorootparentprev> Indeed. It&#x27;s hilarious to see some Americans claiming things are so much better in \"Europe\" when their entire experience consists of a few weeks as a tourist or business traveler in first-tier EU cities.Being specific in your comparison matters.It is indeed facile to make the statement that \"things are so much better in Europe\". Blanket statements are usually stupid.It&#x27;s reasonable, however, to compare the efficacy of public transit of San Francisco to that of Copenhagen, or to compare the a population-wide health indicators of the US to Germany. reply andrewmutz 16 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s not unreasonable, however, to compare the efficiency of public transit of San Francisco to that of Copenhagen. Comparing accessibility of population-wide health indicators of the US to Germany also makes sense.I definitely agree that the US healthcare system sucks and should not be emulated. But I think many of its critics think healthcare is a solved problem in countries like Germany and it really isn&#x27;t. Germans are not completely happy with their healthcare system and there is an effort underway to reform it currently. I think it&#x27;s a better system than the US system, but it&#x27;s got plenty of problems:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;society&#x2F;2022&#x2F;dec&#x2F;14&#x2F;a-ticking-ti...> In Germany, which spends more on healthcare than almost any other country in the world, hospitals are a greater concern, with this winter’s wave of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in young children triggering alarm across the country.> Amid reports of overcrowded casualty departments and parents forced to sleep in hospital corridors or travel hundreds of kilometres for a child’s treatment, the Süddeutsche Zeitung said the country was witnessing “what it means when a system implodes … in scenes which for a long time might have seemed unimaginable”.> In a petition to parliament titled: “Alert level red – hospitals in danger”, the German Hospital Society (DKG) again highlighted a chronic lack of staff as the main problem, noting that many hospitals had had to temporarily close casualty departments due to a lack of doctors and nurses.> More than 23,000 posts remain unfilled in Germany’s hospitals after several years of low recruitment and recent mass resignations, particularly in intensive care and operating theatres, by staff citing a workload so extreme that some were unable to take even a short break or go to the toilet.Additionally, the poor health outcomes in the United States are not necessarily the result of the US health care system. Many of the most important drivers of health care outcomes (exercise, nutrition, obesity, drug abuse, etc) are worse in the US.My point isn&#x27;t that the US health system is great, because it isn&#x27;t great. My point is that people in the US are well informed about their own problems but generally ignorant about the problems outside the country. reply adventured 16 hours agorootparentprevIt often doesn&#x27;t make sense: the nicest countries in Europe won&#x27;t allow you to become an immigrant there, because they&#x27;re hyper xenophobic and or extremely racist. They have very tall barriers to entry that are intentional. They usually call it protecting their culture, it&#x27;s really just plain old xenophobia and racism.The nicest European countries are fragile and can&#x27;t handle immigration well at all. Just ask Sweden how their next 30 or so years are starting to look. France has entirely failed for decades at integrating their immigration populations, despite their vaunted welfare state. They&#x27;re very mediocre at functional integration, whereas the US is the greatest by-design melting pot in world history.Try immigrating into affluent nations like Canada, Australia, Germany, Norway, Finland, etc. They make it far more difficult than it is to come to the US (unless you&#x27;re a top tier immigrant in terms of skill&#x2F;wealth). The nicest countries love to use points systems or the equivalent to keep poorer, lower skilled people out.Canada for example is 2% black and 3% Latin American. Anyone think that&#x27;s an accident? There are roughly 3&#x2F;4 of a billion Latin Americans in the Americas and somehow Canada is merely 3% Latin American. The huge Latin American immigration wave the US has seen over the past 40-50 years has been nearly entirely blocked by Canada. It&#x27;s by design, they&#x27;re xenophobic like the Europeans are, and they do everything they can to keep poor people out.People will say: just look how amazing Norway or Germany are. It&#x27;s a nice fantasy, because good luck becoming a citizen (maybe for the privileged HN crowd there&#x27;s a chance).Japan is amazing? Yeah ok, go try becoming a citizen there. Try integrating, try becoming Japanese (you can&#x27;t).So what the hell is the point of saying: xyz is so wonderful - if they&#x27;re excluding by design and won&#x27;t let you join?Gee, Stanford, MIT and Harvard are amazing, every college should be like that.The US remains moderately accessible, most of its peers are the exact opposite. reply danans 15 hours agorootparent> The US remains moderately accessible, most of its peers are the exact opposite.I agree completely. But that&#x27;s good and practically necessary for the US, since it is highly reliant on immigrants at all levels of skill for their labor.Immigration even underpins the basic functioning of the healthcare system, and not just for doctors and nurses. Cleaning hospitals is a critical job for the healthcare system, and janitorial workers are 20% Latino.However, that doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t plenty that can be learned from the administration of healthcare systems elsewhere.Germany, like the US, has a market based health insurance system organized through employers, but unlike the US, carrying insurance is required by law [1].Furthermore, Germany has universal public coverage for medically necessary care, and controls the price of prescription drugs [2].That doesn&#x27;t make Germany&#x27;s system perfect by a long shot, but it manages to achieve a much lower healthcare spend as a percentage of GDP while maintaining universal coverage for basic healthcare and even offering patients longer average hospital stays than the US does.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.gsu.edu&#x2F;gsuglobalhealth&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;15&#x2F;competition...2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.commonwealthfund.org&#x2F;publications&#x2F;issue-briefs&#x2F;2... reply vkou 16 hours agorootparentprevCanada[1] is 15% Asian (India, China, etc), 4.3% Black, 1.9% arab, 1.6% latin american.The US is 12% black, 18% latin american, 6% Asian.

Nihilism is the likely result of this sort of learned helplessness from a lifetime growing up in an unresponsive democracy. From the get-go, our foundational systems emphasized wealth over democracy. It was a system designed to empower a certain type and class of people, to liberate them from the English Crown&#x27;s influence, but not really a democracy for all. Through our history, we&#x27;ve consistently encouraged wealth creation and resource exploitation&#x2F;monopolization over democratic participation, and where democratic advances were made, they happened against strong headwinds and strong oppression from the wealthy. Slave owners, robber barons, industrialists, tech owners... this has never been a society friendly to the common person. reply cherrycherry98 16 hours agorootparentPrioritizing wealth creation is probably beneficial to most people. As Adam Smith observed:\"It deserves to be remarked, perhaps, that it is in the progressive state, while the society is advancing to the further acquisition, rather than when it has acquired its full complement of riches, that the condition of the labouring poor, of the great body of the people, seems to be the happiest and the most comfortable. It is hard in the stationary, and miserable in the declining state. The progressive state is, in reality, the cheerful and the hearty state to all the different orders of the society; the stationary is dull; the declining melancholy.\"Not that it should come at the expense of exploitation, and Smith would likely agree. He was critical of rent seekers and slavery and was very much interested in the well being of common people.His observation, I believe, it also applicable at a smaller scale when looking at companies. Growing companies are great to work for with lots of excitement, perks, and new opportunities, even for average or mediocre employees. Stagnant companies are difficult and melancholy, not much advancement, raises are small or non existent. Declining ones are miserable as everyone is fighting for survival. reply asow92 12 hours agorootparentprevWhen I talk about apathy, I look around and I see people who care more about Kim Kardashian than history, politics, or financial literacy.

The high tax, high social care system only works if the country is on a good growth track. As more people turn old and retire, someone has to pay for those. With wage stagnation in most normal occupations and lack of growth, the way they have tried to tackle this is with increase in immigration, which in turn keeps wages low in low paying sectors. Also, unlike US which does integration really well, this is not true for Europe where high immigration is leading to even frictions because of lack of integration.On top of that, tech emerging as a big industry which forms a big part of the whole economic output of a country, has led to Europe losing out to US. Although only China through thier protectionism has been safe from that.You can see this in the commentary about UK politics, where they don&#x27;t have money to fund NHS and NHS wages haven&#x27;t grown which has bogged down their healthcare system. Most of the manufacturing ecosystem is completely degraded. Productivity is at a complete toss as well, as they are not even able to build high speed rail well now, which for a social net country like UK should be of paramount importance.To combat this, they have increased taxation, either through freezing slabs or moving down tax slabs. This penalises people in high wage professions and it leads to loss of competitiveness. reply solardev 19 hours agorootparentYou know, the US spends most of our government money on old people too (social security, medicare, etc.). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_federal_budget#&#x2F;... We just get less bang for the buck for it because our healthcare and housing are so terribly inefficient and expensive, and we don&#x27;t have a strong culture of familial support.We can&#x27;t build high speed rail either -- we can&#x27;t even keep our low-speed rail running well -- and our answer to expensive healthcare is typically just \"let them die, we can replace them\" (immigration too, except we don&#x27;t have to give our immigrants anything, just wink and pretend we hate them).At the end of the day no society has it all figured out yet, but I&#x27;d love to live in a place with social services and a less hostile democracy so that all the citizens can work together to figure out next steps, instead of being dragged kicking and screaming by the rich.

Quick googling shows per capita income tax collected in US is $15K, while in UK it is $21KIt&#x27;s a bit trickier than that, because some of the same services (like healthcare) are still paid by the typical consumer in the US, it just doesn&#x27;t show up in their taxes. $6k&#x2F;year might actually just cover the premiums for a small family (what you pay the insurer before you use any services). Using that healthcare would be way more expensive.I think a fairer comparison would be discretionary income (disposable income minus cost of living expenses like housing, healthcare, food, education), etc. Unfortunately that data isn&#x27;t easy to find, and definitions differ, but without considering all of those, it&#x27;s not really apples-to-apples just to look at taxation rates.The average person is more affected by \"how much money do I have left to spend after the essentials\" than \"am I paying the government or a private company for these essentials\". reply lotsofpulp 17 hours agorootparent> $6k&#x2F;year might actually just cover the premiums for a small family (This is not true anywhere in the US.

I was born and raised in Spain, and live and work in the US. I have plenty of family still there, and travel there often enough. Does Spain have significant advantages in social services? Sure! Politics are a little better there too. I also vastly prefer Spain&#x27;s urbanism, where even small towns are far more alive than the largest, densest US metros. But that&#x27;s not all there is to it.I look at Spain&#x27;s labor market and I see a country that is massively failing: Triple the unemployment rate. People out of college there, with good majors, that end up making far less than what they&#x27;d to at McDonalds in the US. Young adults can&#x27;t afford housing either, but not because they have massive student debt, or high healthcare costs, or extreme housing prices, but because salaries are pretty sad. My brother does bioinformatics and has a Ph.D, and he&#x27;d make 4x what he does, today, doing the same job in the massive, booming metropolis that is... St Louis, Missouri. He lives with our retired mother, and they can barely make ends meet.Ultimately the higher growth advantage for the US is long lasting too: If your GDP growth is 0.5% higher than your neighbor, every single year, compound interest makes the difference very stark after a few decades... and a place like Spain already starts 30% poorer.So yes, I&#x27;d still argue that the US is ahead in many areas. The riskiest issue is the difficulty of reforms: Good luck reforming higher education or healthcare, even though other countries have working systems that are better. But even though all it takes to see the advantages of change is to look a little bit, progress seems very difficult, as there&#x27;s just so much money and power on the line in keeping the status quo.

If you are a US citizen, you have access to this economy in ways that other people don&#x27;t.So let me throw out a couple examples of this.* Energy. A shale revolution is now well underway in North America, what this translates to is energy independence and some of the cheapest oil on the planet being well within the USA&#x27;s grasp. But what you will hear Americans talk about if you bring this up is the POLITICAL problem of how we can&#x27;t regulate emissions and the climate apocalypse is going to cook us all. Look I&#x27;m not saying that climate change isn&#x27;t a serious problem. It is. But keeping with my theme here, it&#x27;s going to cook India a lot sooner than it cooks the USA. And the ECONOMIC benefits to the US of the shale revolution are enormous.* Home-shoring. The amount of money going into rebuilding domestic manufacturing capacity right now is staggering, we&#x27;re in the early stages of an enormous boom and a resurgence of stuff that&#x27;s made in the USA, including very high tech companies like TSMC building factories in the US. Again people want to talk about the POLITICS with China and how messy they are, but ECONOMICALLY, the US is going to benefit from a ton of manufacturing growth over the next decade.* Demographics. In the long run, economically, China&#x27;s doomed, Japan&#x27;s doomed, the outlook for much of Europe is bleak because they&#x27;re not having kids. The US still has kids at a somewhat decent rate and has tons of immigration. So again everyone will want to argue about the POLITICS of illegal immigration, but the fact of the matter is, ECONOMICALLY the US will benefit greatly from its demographics.* Tech, rocket ships, you name it - in virtually all bleeding edge industries, the USA is #1 or #2.Betting that the US economy will win (even just in a simple form like using your spare cash to buy the S&P 500 and hold it, something that billions of people in this world can&#x27;t easily do), just keeps on being the right call, almost continuously since WW2.I&#x27;m not saying the politics aren&#x27;t totally fucked up. They are. I&#x27;m not saying the wealth this economy creates is distributed fairly. It&#x27;s not. But especially online the discussion is way way way way way skewed towards \"look how bad these awful US political problems are\" meanwhile the one big advantage you have as an American is you have direct access to this unbelievable economic machine, you are actually a member of it, you can buy and sell things in it (and that is how we get to why the entrepreneurial stuff is important!). reply ttymck 16 hours agoparentprevThe problem is I don&#x27;t want to \"get ahead\" if what&#x27;s behind me (all around me) is poverty, mass shootings and general unrest.

As I say, I&#x27;m rather happily employed these days, but I&#x27;ve also been throught the odd layoff, so I know how precarious things can be. reply GoldenMonkey 20 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t understand this... you would qualify for Medicaid. And it covers everything. No copays. Better than private health insurance. reply JoshTriplett 19 hours agorootparentMedicaid coverage often has many requirements to qualify. Most notably, in many jurisdictions, there is an aggressive asset limit that requires you to liquidate almost everything you own, in order to get coverage when disabled or elderly. Those limits can apply retroactively up to five years, and can also prevent disabled people from being able to marry, because they would lose benefits due to a partner&#x27;s assets. reply piyh 17 hours agorootparentThe Medicaid trust is the way around that. It&#x27;s not a great solution, but it&#x27;s at least something if you&#x27;re in that position and have the time to plan. reply KittenInABox 19 hours agorootparentprevHave you actually been disabled with significant health needs on Medicaid?

Perhaps if needed I could move to a different state, but that poses plenty of problems as well. My plan is mostly to save every dollar I can in the event that I&#x27;m unable to find suitable employment. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with my job now, but it seems inevitable that that changes; every employer I&#x27;ve ever had is now out of business or consumed by private equity and a shell of what it was. I guess that&#x27;s helping the GDP though and I should be happy?

If you have a disability but are still considered &#x27;able to work&#x27; you don&#x27;t qualify for medicaid or medicare.

(I grew up in another country, but never got a passport there because I had a US one from birth. I also spent several weeks in a few other countries -- enough to get a very basic feel for their society and services.)The US is great if you want to \"get ahead\" (and manage to do so), but if you just want a peaceful, boring life, this is not the place to be. We treat our society like a zero-sum game. Between our terrible healthcare, education, school safety, infrastructure, public transportation, politics, insane housing costs, corrupt judges, stances on drugs and abortion, it really feels like a hellhole where either you&#x27;re rich or you&#x27;re worthless. I&#x27;d much rather prefer somewhere in Europe, especially Scandinavia, or maybe Canada or East Asia. But it&#x27;s not easy to emigrate.Even this framing is itself pretty terrible: Our GDP outpaced expectations, so that must be good, right? Hardly. That just means the rich get richer, leaving everyone else even further behind.Life actually seemed way better for millions of working class folks during COVID, when the economy was tanking and government simply propped it up, and suddenly workers everywhere had a lot more respect and negotiation power, and unions grew for the first time in decades. It was the first time in my life I saw our society come together to work together, instead of trying to massively exploit the poor. Then a couple years after COVID and that all goes away, whether it&#x27;s WFH or mass layoffs.I would say the US only makes sense IF you are strongly competitive&#x2F;entrepreneurial and libertarian, not if you are community-minded and just want to live a normal life under a functioning democratic society. \"Pro-business\" usually means \"anti-democratic\" in our society, by disproportionately empowering capital ownership rather than democratic participation and process. reply kjfdslakj 16 hours agorootparent> Between our terrible healthcare, education, school safety, infrastructure, public transportation, politics, insane housing costs, corrupt judges, stances on drugs and abortion, it really feels like a hellhole where either you&#x27;re rich or you&#x27;re worthless.Sigh.

I have only a B.S., negative net worth, and no special skills except web dev (which is increasingly worthless these days). Are there other avenues to emigration that I&#x27;m missing?Also, my partner is American and has family here. I keep trying to convince her to give foreign living a try, and she&#x27;s traveled with me a bunch now, but it&#x27;s still a lot to ask of someone who&#x27;s only ever lived in their home country. Me, I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time traveling to different countries and have a pretty broad perspective to draw from. It&#x27;s harder for someone who&#x27;s never really done that. Still, I hope to coax her into it over time! reply somenameforme 18 hours agorootparent&#x27;Teaching English&#x27; isn&#x27;t really just about teaching English anymore. In many parts of the world (especially Asia) there are bilingual or international schools that generally have an endless demand for native English speakers who also happen to be skilled in math, computer science, or whatever else. The pay will be completely abysmal relative to Western pay, yet enough to live a vastly better life than one would be able to in the West on the Western salary.Depending on where you go to (and what type of institution) a bachelor&#x27;s alone is sufficient. The more exclusive places might require a teaching certificate, but those are easy to get and, in any case, such requirements tend to be quickly relaxed when talking about harder to fill positions, like calculus teachers. You might find you enjoy this. If you don&#x27;t, it can give you the foundation to find something else you might enjoy. Many companies are also constantly looking for skilled native workers. I&#x27;ve friends working in everything from web design to rehab counciling.I&#x27;m not very happy with the current state of the US to say the least, but being born American and simply natively speaking this language is just an unbelievably valuable gift that one should never take for granted.

I don’t aspire to write “Japan travel tip” notes here on Ridgeline, but this is such an easy trick, and one seemingly rarely known, that I can’t help it. As Japan has seen a resurgence of tourism, I’ve noticed more and more slightly-confused looking folks hauling their colossal suitcases around like traumatized barbarians. If you’re one of these suitcase luggers, there’s an easy, cheap way to relieve yourself of this burden: takkyu-bin (pronounced: tah-cue-bean, written sometimes oddly in English as “ta-Q-bin”). To send a giant suitcase to your next hotel — arriving next day, waiting in your room, handled with utmost care and gentleness — costs about $13 USD (maybe even less considering current exchange rates). Every hotel (from the humblest Dormy Inn to some oligarch-owned Aman) does takkyu-bin. Every hotel has the forms and will help you fill them out. “Hi, I’d like to send my luggage using takkyu-bin.” Stick an AirTag in your suitcase (heck, AirTags in all the bags, taped onto bicycles, in wallets, passport cases, AirTags within AirTags within AirTags, those dots twinkling in the sky are not stars, they’re AirTags, slotted into and onto anything else bigger than a breadbox and worth more than a shoe), watch it flit lightly about your smartphone screen to your next stop. Even the airports have a takkyu-bin counter. Disembark, breeze through immigration, and head straight there. Send your bags off. Keep a daypack handy with a toothbrush and change of clothes. (Note, also: You don’t really need pajamas when traveling in Japan since every hotel will supply you with them — and yes, sure, they tend to be odd, making you look like a time-traveling Ebenezer Scrooge, but they’re clean and funny and do the job.) Your luggage will be in your room the next day. If you need some emergency undies or T-shirts, any convenience store will supply you with Good Enough stuff (often of Uniqlo or Muji provenance). Takkyu-bin also works in reverse — send your bags to the airport the day before your return flight. No need to board the Narita Express with trunks capable of holding a dismembered human body. Takyyu-bin takkyu-bin takkyu-bin. Incant the magic phrase and marvel as an unbearable featherweightness fills your sight-seeing life with simple delights. Examples: When my parents visit, we send bags ahead no fewer than four or five times during a two week period. When I do my big walks, I have a supply box (medicine, protein bars, extra clothes) that’s always five days ahead of me — delivered on the day I arrive at an inn down the road. Which reminds me: You can set day / time of deliveries up to ~two weeks in advance; i.e., the friendly takkyu-bin person picks up your bag today and delivers it, say, ten days later. This is great for having gifts meet you at your final hotel, or even the airport. (Most gift shops will also be able to takkyu-bin stuff ahead for you — it’s everywhere.) That’s it. That’s the whole tip. Ship stuff! It took me more than a decade of living in Japan to notice the takkyu-bin service. (It took me about three years to build up the courage to use a Washlet; five to learn to love natto.) I had never considered shooting my bags ahead of me. Now, I can’t imagine traveling around the country for more than a few days without it. I wish someone had grabbed me by the shoulders in my 20s and said: Good god, young man, just send that bag a-head. I know that for Americans (me, being one of you, commiserating deeply), the thought of sending your suitcases ahead multiple times, reliably and without them being destroyed / damaged / stolen sounds as mythical as a leprechaun that expectorates diamonds on command, but here it is common. This is one of many corollaries that present when the systems and structures of a society elevate common workers — the work done is reliably good work. So — come to Japan, but please don’t shuck your four hulking Rimowas onto the Shinkansen. Dispatch them ahead. Not only will it be easier for you, but it’ll minimize the stress of everyone else. My sub-tip would be: Pack sensibly. That is, don’t pack in such a way where you need big suitcases. I realize that that’s not always possible. And, anyway, even for smaller bags — it’s nice to forward them. Train-hopping and exploring cities without baggage encumbrance is a gift you deserve. On the Things Become Other Things book front — I just finished a mega two week editorial-polishing stretch. I’ve been living in the book, bathing in the book, drinking the book. I feel like I am waking from a book-induced coma. Things have become other things alright — my brain has become cinnamon oatmeal. If the book were luggage, I’ve now hauled it up and down the mountain fifty times because there is no takkyu-bin in book land. TBOT’s November Fine Art edition cover has been finalized. Files have been submitted to the printer. DIC colors have been chosen for silk screening. More updates soon. Thank you to everyone who responded to my book survey (and if you haven’t yet responded, please do!). Each and every kind message is read (and often filed away in my “nice things people have written to me” folder) and greatly appreciated. For now, travel well, travel light. Takkyu-biiiiiiin.

I didn’t have time to grab my luggage, so I just left it. I was home, so even if it got lost, I didn’t care in that moment.My luggage showed up at my door the next morning.Since I was flying fairly regularly, I did the same thing again when I landed at home. Sure enough, my luggage showed up at the door the next day. I wasn’t charged anything. It was magic.I did this for years (about 6 times), until one day I caught the guy dropping it off. He apparently worked in lost luggage and my house was right down the street from his house, so he just brought it over each time to be nice.I felt like an ass, but also, I thought there was some magic going on. We had a good laugh about it, but I waited for my luggage after that. reply toyg 11 hours agoparentThat sounds like the beginning of a slice-of-life movie...

More specifically my fiancée and I was on a train bound for Tokyo on some slow train from Kusatsu; a charming winter wonderland with thermal spring goodness. Our schedule that day was to stop over Tokyo for a bit of sightseeing before meeting up with friends in Osaka. We obviously didn&#x27;t want to lug our belongs around, so had the foresight of takkyu-bin all our luggages to Osaka. After some excite.jp translator services with some Kanji the inn staff managed to made a booking and we went on our way.The train ride was atypical the whole way, the train would&#x27;ve stopped randomly and carriages were very full. We even got to see some angry men loudly complaining and tapping the train driver&#x27;s door; quite a rare sight in Japan. We later realised it was the small quakes that had struck before the big one.We arrived in Tokyo delayed, we had some food around Ueno station, just when we were about to board the train the big earthquake struck. It was loud at first, then slow rolling. But it went on for too long. You know it&#x27;s a big one when the local middle school students are cowering and some even started screaming. The station&#x27;s lights shorted from swinging so much and some spark flew as well. Then news came, the bullet train would be cancelled, in fact all trains were cancelled. We walked around aimlessly trying to find accommodation for the night but couldn&#x27;t, everyone was stuck in Tokyo. It was quite funny to see even when almost everything&#x27;s sold out in convenience stores, same food&#x2F;drink were left alone everywhere.At the end we sat and slept in a lobby of a 5 star Hotel nearby Tokyo train station who were nice enough to invite all the people still out and about at 2am. The next morning the bullet train was declared fit to run again, phones started working too, and on our way to catch the train to Osaka, we received a call from our accommodation in Osaka, the staff simply said your luggages arrived yesterday and are here waiting for you. reply keyle 10 hours agoparentI have my fair share of world travel stories, and although at the time were quite distressing, they tend to be forged in our minds as our greatest memories for the years to come.

I&#x27;m not suggesting to onebag a 50L backpack, but to just travel with a wheeled suitcase carry-on and a day-bag that slides onto the handles.Low Cost Carriers (LCC) sometimes weigh your carry-on bags, and I was so proud of the day that happened to me. My suitcase + laptop bag weighed in at exactly 7.0 KG, and the check-in agent kinda looked at it in shock.While American Immigration & Customs is a breeze thanks to Global Entry, other countries can have long immigration lines (and elite status may not help you there), which is when I see people carrying their backpack for an hour or having to slide it across the immigration hall for an hour. The wheeled suitcase carry on saves your back while still being able to store plenty. Don&#x27;t get a hardshell, get a fabric based suitcase as that will be lighter. I also often travel with airlines that I have elite status with, which affords me either less scrutiny or extra carry-on weight allowance.Just need to plan when to book a suite that has a laundry machine, a hotel that has self-serve laundry, or a long stay where you can send your clothes to be cleaned overnight. reply rjh29 10 minutes agoparentCarrying a backpack will make your back stronger, you don&#x27;t \"save\" it by using a wheeled suitcase unless you already have a health condition. Ideally the backpack will have a strap to go along your chest for stability.Pretty much every hotel in Japan has a laundry machine, although I don&#x27;t know of any suites that include one, unless you&#x27;re going for a managed apartment. reply 0xbadcafebee 9 hours agoprevEverywhere else in the world, \"customer service\" means answering a telephone and following a script. In Japan, \"customer service\" means \"a guy in a suit and tie will come to your hostel to hand-deliver a rental cellphone, show you how it works, and remind you very politely to return it within the rental window or you will face overage charges\". It&#x27;s truly a different planet. reply lmm 7 hours agoparentThey still 100% follow a script, it&#x27;s just a more florid one.

I went to Fukuoka for 5 days and asked the person running the Yamato counter in Tokyo how many days I needed to bring my luggage in advance for it to show up at the airport. They said two days, so I showed up three days before I left Japan. Turns out they needed four[0]!I managed to work around this by taking a round-trip Shinkansen trip[1] back to Tokyo to ship my bags from there, at the cost[2] of losing a day in Fukuoka, a Kirby Cafe reservation, and several hits to my pride. I did wind up going to a Japanese arcade for like the first time in my life and acquiring a crippling addiction to rhythm games, but that&#x27;s a story for another time.I&#x27;ve never sent baggage from a hotel though - I always just drag my baggage over to the nearest Yamato desk.[0] And would only explain this to me in rather impenetrable manual keigo that resulted in them pulling out the Translator App of Shame.[1] I had three bags plus backpack. The Shinkansen baggage limit is two bags per passenger, so I needed to get rid of at least one bag and ideally two.[2] The monetary cost was zero - the JR Pass is like the god of train tickets and it&#x27;s a shame they spiked the price. reply lmm 7 hours agorootparentYou could&#x27;ve takyubin&#x27;d one or two bags to a convenience store in Tokyo and collected them once you got off the shinkansen.

But it was even better because they would grab your bags straight from the plane, and it would be in your hotel room waiting for you before you got there. So you wouldn&#x27;t need to do anything at all, except get yourself to Disney using the chartered bus that dropped you off at your hotel.They stopped doing it probably because of covid transfer fears, but probably more largely because attendance was down, so it probably wasn&#x27;t cost effective.

Although you will need to drop off the luggage there before going on with your day, instead of immediately starting your travel-y stuff.If you&#x27;re going by train, the train from the airport to the hotel may be cramped and standing the whole way and involve going up and down stairs or pulling the luggage along streets. If it&#x27;s $13 to ship it to the hotel, that&#x27;s a pretty good deal.Note that Haneda and Narita are both ~1 hour away from Tokyo so a taxi can be pretty expensive especially if you&#x27;re alone. reply vineyardmike 11 hours agoparentprevI think it requires reframing travel a bit.I just got back from Japan ~48hrs ago, and I would’ve agreed with you before the trip - we did take a taxi to the hotel from the airport with our luggage. It seemed easier.In Japan, taxis and road travel are VERY expensive (2x big American cities?), and they have amazing transit infrastructure. We took trains from city to city, exploring and staying at different hotels. In America, this would have required driving. japan has amazing transit, so we wanted to avoid getting extra taxis when the trains go exactly where we need. BUT lugging big bags on trains is a massive PITA for everyone, especially when it’s crowded. The trains are great, and they’re desirable if you didn’t have luggage.Yes, it seems inconvenient, except the framing is bad. We didn’t wait for the bags. We just went about our day, and they showed up in our hotel room when we got back. We took a backpack with one change of clothes, laptop, etc, and the rest of the luggage just showed up later. When it’s time to go to the next hotel, you just pack tomorrow’s clothes, give the concierge your suitcase and start walking. Sure enough, your bag will be there tomorrow when you get back from being a tourist. Until reading this article, I didn’t know they’d hold your bags too, which seems great if you wanna see the city for a few days on a ski trip or something similar where you know you don’t need all your luggage at once. reply wodenokoto 5 hours agorootparent> Until reading this article, I didn’t know they’d hold your bags too, which seems great if you wanna see the city for a few daysIsn’t this normal around the world?

I also left some baggage in Indonesia for a month, but the hotel was large and lax. In two other similar-sized hotels they were storing the bags either in the open-air lobby or in a small staff-only hallway. Neither place would be suitable for medium-term storage. reply vineyardmike 4 hours agorootparentprevI’ve never tried leaving them at a hotel for an extended period of time (overnight or longer). Also my understanding from the article is that you can ship them from the airport to the hotel, to arrive in the future at your date of arrival - not sure if this is the same as your experience in Dubai but either way, new to me :) reply rjh29 5 minutes agorootparentAt least in Japan many of the hotels I use will only hold your bags for the same day (check-in or check-out day), not overnight or longer. reply avidiax 11 hours agoparentprevI and my wife have used this many times when traveling in Japan. It is useful for the shopping suitcase, i.e. the big check-in one that collects the souvenirs, cosmetics, food&#x2F;wine, electronics, etc. that are going home with you. It only needs to arrive before you depart a city, so that you can add some items and send it along.Even if you don&#x27;t buy stuff when traveling, if you would want certain gear for some legs but not others, you can use it as a locker, i.e. moving the hiking boots into your carry-on before the Mt. Fuji leg, putting the heavy winter clothing in after you leave Hokkaido, etc.And in contrast to luggage handling in the U.S., Japan&#x27;s luggage handling is quite cheap, usually on-time, and always handled delicately with very little risk of loss or theft. reply seo-speedwagon 11 hours agoparentprevMost of my last trip to Japan was: 1) leave hotel, 2) take local train &#x2F; bus in City A to the Shinkansen station, 3) Take Shinkansen to city B, 4) take local train &#x2F; bus, 5) walk to hotel.So there wasn’t a lot of taxi usage but a lot of (busy) street walking and (busy) public transit use. Plenty of people did successfully haul their stuff themselves, but luggage forwarding saved us a lot of headache. Felt very worth the price.e: There wasn’t a lot of waiting either. We shipped our stuff 1 full day ahead of time (so if we were checking into our next hotel Wednesday we sent our bags Monday afternoon-ish). Maybe it can seem annoying to keep a day or two of clothes with you in a backpack, but cramming into a packed bus in Kyoto with two roller bags seemed like a far worse bargain to us. reply mitthrowaway2 7 hours agoparentprevIn Japan, the default assumption is that unless you&#x27;re in a very rural area, everyone goes everywhere by public transit. Even if you&#x27;re just heading to downtown Tokyo from Narita airport, the Skyliner will be faster and cheaper than a taxi. Furthermore, you probably aren&#x27;t taking a taxi from one prefecture to the next. reply rjh29 3 minutes agorootparentYet I never see Japanese people with luggage on trains, whether that be an airport train or the subway.

Your passport is absolutely necessary to get on the airplane and go home, wherever you go.

Not all countries are like this; in America, there&#x27;s no requirement to carry ID at all times, for instance.Also in Japan, if you&#x27;re a foreigner (this includes non-citizens on long-term visas or even with permanent residence status), you must carry identification at all times. Usually, this means your \"residence card\", since it&#x27;s dumb to carry your passport unless you&#x27;re traveling internationally. Citizens, however, are not required to carry ID.

Unfortunately, though, this is one of the worst-optimized PC games of 2023. Cities Skylines 2, even on a completely new/empty map, runs with 20fps on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 at 4K/High. I’m truly shocked by how bad this game runs. And if this city builder used Ray Tracing or Path Tracing, I wouldn’t be complaining. We know that Ray Tracing and Path Tracing are really demanding. But no, Cities Skylines 2 does not take advantage of them. And seriously, take a look at the screenshots and video. What on Earth is pushing the RTX 4090 so hard here? Since I’m not really good at city builders, we’ll use an empty map for our upcoming PC Performance Analysis. In other words, we’ll be doing this game a favor. Because if it performs like that on an empty map, I can’t imagine how it will run with a mid/big city. We do know that a mid-sized city runs with 7-12fps on an AMD Radeon RX 7900XTX. And if the main menu is anything to go by, then we might have an idea of the performance of a big city on an RTX4090. And look and behold. 10fps. 10fps on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX4090. That’s more demanding than Cyberpunk 2077 in 4K with Path Tracing. Man, what a mess. Colossal Order is currently working on making the game run better. The team is optimizing/balancing the effects that affect fillrate. Thus, they’re making changes to things like Depth of Field, Global Illumination, and Volumetrics to make them work better and not slow down your game. After further experimentation, we figured out the one setting that can cripple performance. That’s the Depth of Field Quality. By lowering it to Low, we were able to improve performance in the main menu. However, in our empty map, we could not come close to a 60fps experience. Instead, the game was running with 40fps. 40fps with this kind of visuals on an NVIDIA RTX 4090. Enough said. As I mentioned before, we’re going to use an empty map to test how well the game runs on different computers. It wanted to test it with a medium-sized city, but the game doesn’t have a benchmark tool, and there are no pre-made cities to use. So, our benchmarks will showcase the best possible performance you can get in this city builder. Stay tuned for more!

This takes me straight back to 2003 when SimCity 4 came out, turned out to be an absolute resource hog, and I&#x27;d have been overjoyed with 20fps.As the late Henry Petroski said: \"The most amazing achievement of the computer software industry is its continuing cancellation of the steady and staggering gains made by the computer hardware industry.\" reply Twirrim 8 hours agoparentThe 2013 version of SimCity was a disaster for all sorts of reasons, not least of which that they took game devs and just mysteriously expected them to know how to build and run online services, run databases etc. A friend of mine was working for another EA subsidiary and ended up being parachuted in to try to help save the day. One of his first contributions made a phenomenal difference: He enabled connection pooling to the database servers.

They&#x27;ve been doing lots of testing on their end (refreshing), and in the final stretch they found two glaring issues.These two issues were glaringly, obviously wrong in core modules, and 100% reproducible.Both were bad queries (static but parameterized). One resulted in an error from the DB server, and the other was a full join rather than filter by parameter (x=x vs x=:x), so spectacularly wrong results. Both were triggered by doing typical operations in our application.Both issues had been in our code for many, many months, yet somehow the thousands of users we have across our several hundred customers somehow didn&#x27;t report or experience these issues.I fixed both issues in less than 15 minutes.This isn&#x27;t the first time. Sometimes I&#x27;m amazed how long such glaring issues manages to survive out in the wild amongst our customers.Not saying they didn&#x27;t know.

You can fix performance with a patch. It&#x27;s hard to walk back \"game crashes when I trigger the main menu\" reply fourteenfour 14 hours agorootparentprevI think they released it without having a discussion about how bad an impression poor default settings could make. With a few adjustments it looks great and is very playable on my 3080 at 4K even before the patch. Really big blunder for sure. reply ptasci67 15 hours agoprevI will fully concede that the trend of game makers releasing half-baked, poorly optimized games that are buggy and unplayable at launch is totally a thing and it is frustrating and we should demand better (though we keep buying so why would they stop?).BUT.... the online game community is so insufferable and this Cities Skylines II launch is a great example of it. The game is not about 4k 120 fps gameplay. It is a simulation game that runs fairly well even on last gen&#x27;s hardware if you drop SOME of the fidelity settings. But that&#x27;s not the predominant discourse. If people can&#x27;t play it at 4k out of the box on their overpriced 4090 then they take straight to the internet to complain (and mind you they have tried fiddling with exactly 0 knobs to make it runnable).I am by no means making excuses for game makers who certainly share much of the blame for creating an environment of distrust among game fans. But the online discourse is just rage baiting and looking for anything to hate with minimal evidence or sometimes even outright lies. Makes me want to go into a cave and play my games without seeing any content or discussion about it. reply wackget 15 hours agoparent> If people can&#x27;t play it at 4k out of the box on their overpriced 4090 then they take straight to the internet to complain (and mind you they have tried fiddling with exactly 0 knobs to make it runnable).The top comment contains this extract from an IGN review:> I have a 13900k, 64GB of RAM, and a RTX 4090, playing on a 1440p ultrawide monitor. I got 35fps at the main menu and in game on a brand new map w&#x2F;o building a single thing. Turning off motion blur and depth field increased this from 35 to 50fps. Not a single other graphics setting changed the performance at all. I turned off every single setting I could or set it to the lowest possible, and still only got 50fps. reply ptasci67 15 hours agorootparentYes, I was addressing the broader discourse more generally, specifically Reddit. But you&#x27;re right that the article did directly address this though I would say the tone and title of the article are incongruous with the simple fact that they were able to get the game to run well with minor tweaks.I take issue with \"only got 50fps\". This is not Counter Strike or a game that demands 300fps. 50fps (if your 1% lows are within reason) is completely playable. reply fluoridation 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not about the number by itself, it&#x27;s what the number implies. If an RTX 4090 can&#x27;t get to 60 FPS on an empty map, what will happen when the game is running on an RTX 4060 and it has to render a complete city?>I take issue with \"only got 50fps\". This is not Counter Strike or a game that demands 300fps. 50fps (if your 1% lows are within reason) is completely playable.You&#x27;re complaining about people complaining. If you&#x27;re satisfied with the game being playable then play it, but others may have different expectations of quality, and it&#x27;s not wrong for them to voice their opinion when the product they paid money for doesn&#x27;t meet them.

Most people online voicing their opinions come off as know-it-all teens or children throwing tantrums. It&#x27;s as-if they have a _right_ to a CS2 with 120fps. Paradox warned about bad performance prior to launch (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.paradoxplaza.com&#x2F;forum&#x2F;threads&#x2F;updates-on-modd...). Nobody claimed or said performance was gonna be great. And still, people act surprised.It&#x27;s no surprise that the reviews was down at close to 30% a couple of hours into the release and today at 52%. Why is there such a massive bias towards large reviews at the first hours? Because many gamers loves thrashing about. It&#x27;s much more important than taking a step down and calming down. reply fluoridation 12 hours agorootparentThe people who reviewed the game in the first few days were the ones who either pre-ordered it or bought it as soon as it came out. They were so excited to play the new installment they took a gamble and trusted that the developer would produce a polished product, because they wanted to be able to play it as soon as possible. When they got to play the game, they saw it ran poorly to the point that it might have spoiled the experience for them. They&#x27;re right to be angry about it, especially when developers and publishers make most of their money during the first few weeks since launch. By releasing a half-finished product they&#x27;re treating their most enthusiastic users like crap. They didn&#x27;t have to do that, they could have delayed the launch. Be it because of decisions made by the publisher or by the developer, they chose to release when they did. They made their bed, now they have to lie in it. I don&#x27;t blame anyone who raves about performance, because what was released was well outside the realm of what&#x27;s acceptable for a finished product, regardless of what said prior to launch. You don&#x27;t get to sell a car with an asterisk that says \"by the way, the fuel tank leaks so until we find a way to fix it you&#x27;ll use twice as much fuel as normal\". reply Kuxe 12 hours agorootparent> You don&#x27;t get to sell a car with an asterisk that says \"by the way, the fuel tank leaks so until we find a way to fix it you&#x27;ll use twice as much fuel as normal\".Yeah. But in case of CS2, gamers did buy the leaking car. Devs analogously said \"by the way, the fuel tank leaks\" and people just went with \"OK\" and bought CS2, after which the customer started to complain (rave?!) about leaking fuel tanks. The car salesman retail store said \"Well you can have all money back no questions asked until you&#x27;ve driven at least 160km\". Steam has generous refunds. What does the customer do? (S)he still goes onto review sites and bitch about bad leaking fuel tanks. It is very much in bad faith on the customers part.I wouldn&#x27;t rush to Colossal Games defense if customers just said \"It ran bad for me on my 4090 for some reason so I refunded\". That&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going on with the negative reviews though. People act entitled. reply fluoridation 11 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re still not getting it. Yeah, if a car dealership had such a generous return policy you could get your money back and get a car that does what you need within your budget. But these people didn&#x27;t want just a city builder and they happened to buy this one. They wanted to play the new version of Cities: Skylines. They&#x27;re loyal fans and they&#x27;re treated like beta testers.Yes, it&#x27;s entitlement. Customers are entitled to get a quality product in exchange for their money. When Paradox goes to spend their earnings they&#x27;re not going to be throttled to do it at 45 cents per second. reply csydas 11 hours agorootparentprevthis is why car analogies are dangerous :)I would argue a dealer telling you about a major defect directly before you buy the car is a bit different than a post on some forums that the product they&#x27;re selling is not well made.I would suggest it&#x27;s not reasonable to expect that someone buying a game has to do research on a forum to know the game is unfinished -- if it&#x27;s being sold as a finished game it&#x27;s reasonable to expect it&#x27;s in a playable state. the original post was meaning to say it would be unheard of for other products to allow companies to sell known unfinished products as finished products, even with the promise of completing the product. and consumers would similarly balk at such a proposal for virtually any other object.it was more the absurdity of the different way games are treated which is anti-consumer. replybigstrat2003 6 hours agorootparentprevEven 30 FPS is perfectly playable in any game.

I don&#x27;t have a computer that meets their minimum system requirements. I really feel like the cycle of newer games requiring more hardware is pointless and wasteful. I wish publishers would focus on good game design and make their games accessible to people without high-powered gaming hardware. reply sp332 15 hours agorootparentIt takes a lot of time and effort to pare down the assets and add tricks to make a game look good on lower hardware.

Most C:S fans were more excited for a more realistic traffic AI and mixed use zoning. Yet this experience was made unplayable by an attempt to make it look prettier.That&#x27;s not fair. This is a new engine that they probably expect to support for maybe as long as 10 or 15 years. As a AAA publisher, Paradox doesn&#x27;t get to stylize behind indie-style aesthetics and needs to keep up with where their peers are headed. It&#x27;s not aiming to be prettier just for the heck of it, but because it needs to maintain a certain mark to keep the franchise relevant.Knowing Paradox, more rich gameplay enhancements probably are on the update and DLC agenda, and we can assume that their designers really care about that kind of stuff. But for AAA publishers like them, there are also other factor that matter and that may need to take priority.That said, what a f&#x27;d up and premature launch! reply Miraste 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true at all. Nothing else Paradox publishes has AAA graphics, and that&#x27;s not the target audience for their games. The first Cities Skylines didn&#x27;t beat Sim City because it had better graphics. It was because of gameplay.

Lots of unnecessary graphics settings are enabled, leading to bad first time experiences. After disabling elements that most users won&#x27;t care about (motion blur, volumetric clouds, global illumination) and following some tips from people online, I find no issue enjoying the game >60fps without my GPU fans screaming. (to be fair, using 7900x &#x2F; 3090)Yes the graphics need optimization, but they could have rolled out the release with good defaults and just admitted that high end graphics needed more time... but you can enjoy the game in the meantime! Instead, their steam reviews will remain marred. reply fourteenfour 14 hours agoparentYay, finally a comment that is similar to my experience and isn&#x27;t speculation or kneejerk reaction. I&#x27;m enjoying the game at 4k and it looks better than CS now that I&#x27;ve adjusted things. They totally screwed up the default settings, not sure why as it seems like an unforced error. It actually picked a resolution with a 24Hz refresh rate when it first loaded for me. I think their \"virtual texturing\" optimization also kicks off on first run, making the initial menu experience stuttery and slow. reply onli 9 hours agoparentprevThey even wrote about it beforehand.

You can paint the screen 144 times a second, but only tick the simulation 10 times a second and get a much better experience than painting the screen and updating the simulation 20 times a second.

Sure, it’s a simulation, but it’s primarily a game, not a weather model. And I say this as an early adopter of high hertz monitors and a frequent fps player. I absolutely need high frames and low input latency in a competitive PvP game, but in a strategy game, it’s much more important that the tick rate is fast enough that it’s interesting. A slow sim is boring, and it’s not just me, people complain about this all the time in (late game) Stellaris(another Paradox title). reply jdiff 15 hours agoparentprevIf the issue is occuring even on the main menu and a completely new, bare level, that possibility can be safely eliminated.

That&#x27;s as opposed to creating a cohesive rendering pipeline that deduplicates effort and accomplishes the same.On top of that, and most importantly, I doubt they allotted time to refactor and optimize, or... they allotted it after release.If you thrash Unity&#x27;s APIs hard enough, which in turn thrashes the underlying vulkan&#x2F;DX level APIs, clever drivers aren&#x27;t quite enough to keep the GPU loaded with useful work.There&#x27;s probably a long tail of other stuff they need to profile and tweak to get a better balance of performance to visual quality, like changing the precision of shader calculations, tuning level of detail, and so on. reply TylerE 12 hours agoparentprevWell, they both use the same engine.

The shadows are terrible and there are loads of rendering glitches.I&#x27;m also a bit concerned now my city is getting bigger at how poor the traffic wayfinding is. Seems to be as dumb as CS1 (with no mods) which is really bad, with the added nuisance that the traffic cycle seems to be basically 0 cars until rush hour then a massive flood of traffic.It&#x27;s actually quite ironic that all I really wanted from CS was faster performance in bigger cities (huge fail from CS2 here), better traffic simulation (jury is out but isn&#x27;t looking great) and better road tools (this is what cs2 is great at). reply WXLCKNO 14 hours agorootparentprevBeing set to a default of 24hz sounds like the idea of someone forced to ship the game, hoping users wouldn&#x27;t notice. reply brucethemoose2 12 hours agorootparentIts probably just detecting a 24p TV resolution in fullscreen, if I were to guess. reply babypuncher 11 hours agorootparentBut no TV maxes out at 24hz, that is a lower bound meant to support things like blu-ray players for judder-free movie playback.60 hz has always been the bare minimum any display supports, so if any game is picking something below that then something has gone horribly wrong.

Moving the camera around makes things blurry at low frame rate (and 50fps is low) because of sample-and-hold blur. This can be mitigated by strobing the screen at the same speed as the frame rate, but few monitors support strobing at 50Hz (it would look annoyingly flickery) and if the game ever dropped below 50fps it would break the effect.Blur Busters explains:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blurbusters.com&#x2F;faq&#x2F;oled-motion-blur reply kriops 2 hours agorootparentprevTry moving file explorer windows with your display set to different refresh rates. “Blur” might be an incorrect description, but it’s how I would describe it at least. reply wlesieutre 15 hours agorootparentprev20 fps is playable for a city builder, but that&#x27;s on a $2000 GPUA bit unfair since most people aren&#x27;t gaming at 4K (Steam hardware survey puts it at 3.29%), but still reply washadjeffmad 14 hours agorootparentOk, so around 4 million users. I wonder what the overlap of 4K owners and people who play city builders is? reply dimgl 14 hours agorootparentI feel like this is grasping at straws? Plenty of unorthodox games go mainstream. Can’t expect consumer hardware to the stay the same forever. This game is just poorly optimized. reply washadjeffmad 12 hours agorootparentI think I&#x27;m giving people the opposite impression that I intended.Well-compensated people (like engineers) are more likely to own a 4K monitor and high-end GPU, so I meant to convey that there&#x27;s probably a large overlap with the type of people who play city builders (like engineers), so they really should have accounted for that.It was only after I bought my 4K 120Hz OLED that I found out how popular they are for sims, including pinball. It&#x27;s been awesome. reply janosdebugs 12 hours agorootparentprevAnecdotal evidence: I play at 4k if I can manage, and I sport a 2060S. reply stodor89 15 hours agorootparentprev50fps is okay. 50fps on a $1600 GPU is definitely not okay. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentprevIt is just a matter of preference, I don’t see why people get bent out of shape about it.30fps is fine for lots of games. Especially for stuff that doesn’t require super twitchy gameplay.If somebody really cares about 60fps or 120fps, fine. But the developers have some effects they want to implement, and if some of them don’t fit into 8.3ms, let those of us who don’t mind 30fps enjoy them, right? reply ryandrake 9 hours agorootparent30FPS on the world&#x27;s #1 fastest GPU is totally not OK. Heck, I&#x27;d be unhappy with 30FPS on my ancient Radeon Pro 580.I remember easily getting frame rates far in excess of my monitor&#x27;s top refresh rate back in 1999. reply bee_rider 7 hours agorootparentWhy isn’t it ok? reply dimgl 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, yes it is.

If Anno 1800 can run at 100+ framerates, surely this game can too. reply xcv123 14 hours agorootparentprevThe issue is that if it runs at 50 FPS on an RTX 4090, it&#x27;s going to run at 5 FPS on an average GPU. reply Kuxe 14 hours agorootparentProblem with these kinds of statements is that.. well, they&#x27;re not true.

It&#x27;s 50 fps with the best possible hardware and lowest possible settings.But also, yes, even in a city builder low for is very annoying when you&#x27;re used to the smoothness of 100+. reply antisthenes 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a huge issue, considering the game doesn&#x27;t look like a revolution in graphics AND you&#x27;re essentially playing it on a super-computer by 5-6 year old standards.> I put 8 hours into Frostpunk before realizing I was limited to 30FPS.Yes, and I have beaten games that rendered improperly at sub-30FPS as a kid, because the requirement was 16MB of VRAM, while my card only had 8. But that&#x27;s just as irrelevant to the point being made. reply babypuncher 11 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is the UI won&#x27;t be smooth on VRR displays unless they implemented some clever workarounds. Your mouse cursor will only update at the same framerate as the rest fo the game. Even budget gaming monitors these days support g-sync, freesync, or both, so it&#x27;s no longer a problem that only affects a small % of users with deep pockets.The only workaround I can think of that wouldn&#x27;t also defeat the point of having VRR would be to add some in-engine low framerate compensation artifically boost the reported framerate to a multiple of the real framerate, but I have yet to see any games that actually do this. reply sidewndr46 14 hours agorootparentprevAs someone who can safely say that watching a video game in 30 FPS is equivalent to watching a slideshow, yes.

(Error Code: 102630) 3 VIEW ALL PHOTOS UW Medicine is working on a groundbreaking procedure to get rid of painful kidney stones while you're awake, no anesthesia needed. (KOMO) 6 SEATTLE — A groundbreaking medical procedure for those with kidney stones will soon be offered at the University of Washington after more than two decades of research. It will also give astronauts the go ahead they need from NASA to travel to Mars. It's a groundbreaking procedure to get rid of painful stones while you're awake, no anesthesia needed. \"This has the potential to be game changing,\" said Dr. Kennedy Hall with UW Medicine. Still being run through clinical trials at UW Medicine, the procedure called burst wave lithotripsy uses an ultrasound wand and soundwaves to break apart the kidney stone. Promoted Links 29+ Coolest Gifts Nobody Would Think Of Cool Gifts Click Here Ultrasonic propulsion is then used to move the stone fragments out, potentially giving patients relief in 10 minutes or less. \"It would really kind of revolutionize the treatment of kidney stones in the sense that you could come to the clinic and have a stone treated before its a problem,\" said Dr. Jonathan Harper with UW Medicine. Seattle resident Mark Mackenzie will tell you first hand, the treatment works. He got a chance to take part in the clinical trial just days before he was to be operated on. \"Nothing else in your life matters when you're experiencing kidney stone pain. I wrote an email to the folks that had done the treatment and just thanked them from the bottom of my heart for saving me from that ordeal,\" Mackenzie said. \"It's not a cure-all for everybody, but in some cases, as in mine, it can be, almost what amounts to a miracle cure.\" Dr. Kennedy Hall, an emergency medicine doctor at Harborview Medical Center, said this will also change how future patients are treated in the emergency room, who show up, having no idea they have a kidney stone. \"There are a lot of patients with kidney stones, over a million visits a year to emergency departments,\" said Hall. \"Many of them would have stones that we could intervene on at that point of care in the emergency department, so it's potentially groundbreaking.\" This technology is also making it possible for astronauts to travel to Mars, since astronauts are at a greater risk for developing kidney stones during space travel. It's so important to NASA, the space agency has been funding the research for the last 10 years. \"They could potentially use this technology while there, to help break a stone or push it to where they could help stay on their mission and not have to come back to land,\" said Harper. READ THE COMMENTS (6) Right now this technology is only available through clinical trials, but according to UW Medicine, it may be available to be used on patients in a regular office setting within the next year or so.

It solves so many issues.I know smaller craft can’t do this but we can always do a long tether with a counterweight.(My personal pet idea is to go for super low gravity like .05G to start out to simplify things. You still get to walk around, go to the bathroom, spill liquids and clean up, cook, etc. ) reply Lord-Jobo 15 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;podcasts&#x2F;houston-we-have-a-podcast&#x2F;arti...This podcast covers a lot of the status on international studies for artificial gravity.\"Now we did try to fly a centrifuge on station around 2009 or 2010. And again, it was the same international community and we put together an international proposal to do it on station. And it turns out after a lot of hemming and hawing and the U.S. was going to provide the crew and the integration, the Japanese were going to fly it and the Europeans were going to pay for the device and have it built, and flight certified. It turns out that the station really isn’t designed for that much vibration. So instead of just having a person laying there, we were going to have a person with a cycle ergometer that would spin and do the ergometer. And that much vibration was bad for the station and it was decided that you would have to have a very expensive vibration isolation system that the Europeans weren’t willing to pay for to be able to do it. So, we kind of lost the possibility of doing human centrifuge work on station at this time.\"So it looks like this is the current issue, and there is a large amount of work going into the physiological side of research to find out exactly what amounts and methods of artificial gravity achieve desired results. reply Teever 15 hours agorootparentThis all stems from the fact that the current cost to orbit per kg is too impractical to build a space station that is designed to rotate. reply _Microft 18 hours agorootparentprevWe have years of experience with both short and long-term missions in zero or micro gravity but we know a lot less about how low gravity affects the human body.

Surely the average astronaut doesn&#x27;t pass 30 kidney stones every two years, that&#x27;s more than one a month. So it&#x27;s either over a specific two year period (for every astronaut in space at the time, probably a lot?) or it&#x27;s for a specific number of astronauts. Confusing sentence. reply tsimionescu 12 hours agorootparentI think they mean there have been 30 reported cases of an astronaut getting a kidney stone less than 2 years after their latest space flight.Given that astronauts are exceptionally physically fit individuals to start with, at least at the time of their space missions, this is probably quite significant evidence that space flight causes kidney stones. reply letmevoteplease 19 hours agoparentprevNASA currently considers kidney stones an unacceptable risk for a Mars mission that requires mitigation.[1] There are also about 10 other risks requiring mitigation, though.[1][1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov&#x2F;Risks&#x2F;risk.aspx?i=81[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;humanresearchroadmap.nasa.gov&#x2F;Risks&#x2F; reply ghufran_syed 19 hours agorootparentNASA saying there is a “research gap” and that it “needs mitigation” is very different from it being an “unacceptable risk” which implies that no mission can happen until it happens. if there was a ship ready to go with a hab and propellant for the return trip sitting on mars, I can guarantee they would take the very next transfer window, kidney stone risk notwithstanding- particularly if the chinese or russians were about to do so and might get there first! reply bumby 14 hours agorootparentAccording to the method by which NASA measures risk, it is indeed an \"unacceptable risk\". The red 4x4 \"LxC\" box stands for \"likelihood x consequence\". So they consider it a high likelihood and a severe consequence. It&#x27;s red because that puts it in the unacceptable category.If you look at the medical risk matrix it puts the likelihood between 60% - 80% and consequence at \"loss time injury or illness per OSHA criteria\" On a score of 1 (least risky) to 25 (most risky), a 4x4 scores 22.Now to your point about \"guaranteeing\" they would still go, they are allowed to waive these risks through a formal process. It tends to make managers squeamish though, because nobody wants to be the person who&#x27;s signature is attached to a known risk that eventually causes a mishap.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasa.gov&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2015&#x2F;10&#x2F;s3001_guidel... reply hypercube33 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean I just watched a bunch of documentaries about Challenger and Columbia...you&#x27;re damn right they would rubber stamp it. reply WirelessGigabit 18 hours agorootparentprevMaybe I&#x27;m not looking at the right terms but the appendix isn&#x27;t on it.

A couple of years later I wound up having a few stones that had grown to larger than an inch.If you have unusual and unexpected pain it’s definitely worth getting checked out.

The \"game-changer\" is the introduction of burst wave lithotripsy, which apparently is less painful and thus possible to go through without general anaesthisia, which, don’t get me wrong, is definitely an improvement. But I’m not sure I’d call it a game changer.I’m not convinced it’s entirely painless as it’s still the same \"crush and drive out via ultrasound\" idea. Combine this with the fact that just existing is excruciating with stones, i don’t see a way around opioid analgesia. Additionally, the game hasn’t changed in the regard of the human pelvis being great at keeping out ultrasound, so if your stones are out of reach that way, you’re SOL. reply indigomm 17 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve had lithotripsy and it certainly wasn&#x27;t done under general anaesthetic.

    "title": "Now add a walrus: Prompt engineering in DALL-E 3",
    "originLink": "https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/26/add-a-walrus/",
    "originBody": "Simon Willison’s Weblog Subscribe Now add a walrus: Prompt engineering in DALL-E 3 Last year I wrote about my initial experiments with DALL-E 2, OpenAI’s image generation model. I’ve been having an absurd amount of fun playing with its sequel, DALL-E 3 recently. Here are some notes, including a peak under the hood and some notes on the leaked system prompt. DALL-E 3 is available via ChatGPT Plus. For $20/month you get GPT-4 access, DALL-E 3, GPT Vision, Code Interpreter (aka Coding Intern), ChatGPT Plugins and the new, weird and slightly dystopian voice chat feature in the ChatGPT mobile apps. It’s absolutely worth the money, for the combined entertainment value alone. A fascinating thing about DALL-E 3 is that you don’t prompt it directly: you instead access it via ChatGPT, which prompts the model for you. ChatGPT then turns your query into several prompts, each producing a different image. The prompts it generates are available if you click on the images (on mobile you have to flip your phone horizontal to see that option). I started by typing this into ChatGPT with DALL-E enabled: A super posh pelican with a monocle watching the Monaco F1 It gave me these four images. I’ve included the prompt it used for each one: Photo of a refined pelican wearing a shiny gold monocle, perched on a railing with the Monaco Grand Prix F1 race in the background. The race cars blur past on the circuit, while yachts are anchored in the nearby harbor. Illustration of a sophisticated pelican donning a crystal clear monocle, observing the Monaco F1 race with keen interest. The race track is filled with speeding F1 cars, and the Mediterranean Sea sparkles in the distance with luxurious yachts. Watercolor painting of a posh pelican, its feathers groomed to perfection, equipped with a delicate monocle. It stands tall with the iconic Monaco F1 race happening behind it, cars racing at breakneck speeds and the shimmering sea beyond. Vector image of an elegant pelican with a classy monocle, standing gracefully against the backdrop of the Monaco Grand Prix. The F1 cars create a colorful streak as they race, and lavish yachts float in the nearby waters. Note how the prompts it generates cover four different styles—photo, illustration, watercolor painting and vector image. They also use pleasing and varied language to describe different aspects of the image. ChatGPT is prompting DALL-E for us! The really fun thing though is that you can ask it follow-ups. I said: More like the first one please And got back: Photo of an aristocratic pelican adorned with a golden monocle, perched confidently with the Monaco Grand Prix F1 race unfolding behind it. The Formula 1 cars zip by on the circuit, while opulent yachts are moored in the nearby marina. Photo of a regal pelican with a polished monocle, standing prominently against the backdrop of the Monaco F1 race. The roar of the engines can almost be heard as the cars speed past, and the glinting sea is dotted with luxurious boats. Photo of a distinguished pelican sporting a gleaming monocle, observing the Monaco Grand Prix from a vantage point. Racing cars leave a trail of dust as they navigate the circuit, with the blue sea and anchored yachts completing the panorama. Photo of a chic pelican, its eye magnified by a pristine monocle, captivated by the Monaco F1 race happening just meters away. The racetrack buzzes with activity as F1 cars race, and the horizon showcases the grandeur of the harbor with its yachts. Next I added what is becoming my universal DALL-E 3 follow-up prompt, always guaranteed to produce better results: Add a walrus The result: Photo of a posh pelican with a golden monocle and a distinguished walrus, both observing the Monaco Grand Prix F1 race. The pelican is perched on a railing while the walrus lounges nearby. Formula 1 cars race by on the circuit, with lavish yachts in the marina behind them. Photo of an aristocratic pelican and a stately walrus side by side, watching the Monaco F1 with keen interest. The pelican has a monocle, and the walrus’s tusks shine brightly. The race track is alive with the sound of roaring engines, and the harbor is filled with luxurious boats. Photo of a regal pelican, its eye magnified by a monocle, and a majestic walrus with gleaming tusks, both captivated by the Monaco Grand Prix. The racetrack is a blur of speed, and the horizon showcases the grandeur of the harbor and its anchored yachts. Photo of a chic pelican with a pristine monocle and a sophisticated walrus, both engrossed in the Monaco F1 race. The pelican stands on a vantage point, and the walrus sits comfortably beside it. Racing cars zoom past, and the sea is dotted with opulent boats. That second one is amazing—exactly what I want from a photo of a posh pelican and a walrus watching the Monaco Grand Prix. I also enjoy how the third image ended up as a weird Pelican-Walrus hybrid, with tusks, a monocle and pelican feathers for the hair and whiskers. Then @BrockMcBreadcat suggested: Now make them muppets Photo of Muppet versions of a pelican and a walrus, both with exaggerated, comical features. The pelican Muppet wears a monocle and the walrus Muppet sports oversized tusks. They are animatedly discussing the Monaco Grand Prix F1 race, with caricatured F1 cars and yachts in the background. Illustration of Muppet-inspired pelican and walrus characters. The pelican has a large, beady eye accentuated by a monocle, while the walrus has a playful grin and prominent tusks. They are engrossed in the Monaco F1 race, with whimsical racing cars and yachts creating a lively backdrop. Photo of two Muppet characters: a pelican with a monocle and a walrus with big, goofy tusks. They’re seated in a Muppet-style commentary booth, providing humorous commentary on the Monaco Grand Prix. Cartoonish F1 cars race by, and colorful yachts are seen in the distance. Illustration of a pelican and walrus as Muppet characters. The pelican Muppet looks sophisticated with its monocle, and the walrus Muppet chuckles with its oversized tusks. They are enjoying the Monaco F1 race, with the track filled with Muppet-style racing cars and quirky yachts. LOVE that third one! I mentioned on Twitter that it was a shame you can’t reuse elements of an image for further visual consistency... and was pointed to a thread by Paul Couvert explaining how to do exactly that using seeds. I didn’t believe this would work—my mental model of how random number seeds and image generation models work doesn’t fit what happened next. I wrote: What is the seed for image three? ChatGPT replied: The seed for the third image is 1379049893. If you have any other questions or requests, please let me know! Then I said: Add bow ties to both characters in seed 1379049893 Photo of two Muppet characters: a pelican with a monocle and a bow tie, and a walrus with big, goofy tusks and a dapper bow tie. They’re seated in a Muppet-style commentary booth, providing humorous commentary on the Monaco Grand Prix. Cartoonish F1 cars race by, and colorful yachts are seen in the distance. I’m pretty stunned by this. It’s not an exact recreation—the boats in the background have changed slightly, and it added a top hat that I wasn’t expecting. But it’s pretty close! People have been trying to figure out hacks to get Midjourney to create consistent characters for the past year, and DALL-E 3 apparently has that ability as an undocumented feature! Peeking under the hood Let’s see if we can find out a bit more about how this works. I used the Firefox DevTools network inspector to grab the JSON representation of my conversation with ChatGPT. Here’s a pretty-printed copy. At line 1087 you can see the point where I asked it to “Add bow ties to both characters in seed 1379049893”. The next message in the transcript looks like this: { \"id\": \"5300d51c-794d-4d5f-bf75-6ea2dad4027c\", \"author\": { \"role\": \"assistant\", \"metadata\": {} }, \"create_time\": 1698340593.174454, \"content\": { \"content_type\": \"text\", \"parts\": [ \"{\\n \\\"prompts\\\": [\\n \\\"Photo of two Muppet characters: a pelican with a monocle and a bow tie, and a walrus with big, goofy tusks and a dapper bow tie.

The “parts” key includes some encoded JSON. Decoded and pretty-printed that looks like this: { \"prompts\": [ \"Photo of two Muppet characters: a pelican with a monocle and a bow tie, and a walrus with big, goofy tusks and a dapper bow tie.

Cartoonish F1 cars race by, and colorful yachts are seen in the distance.\" ], \"size\": \"1024x1024\", \"seeds\": [1379049893] } There’s that 1379049893 seed from earlier! The prompt has changed very slightly. The original prompt for the image was: Photo of two Muppet characters: a pelican with a monocle and a walrus with big, goofy tusks. They’re seated in a Muppet-style commentary booth, providing humorous commentary on the Monaco Grand Prix. Cartoonish F1 cars race by, and colorful yachts are seen in the distance. The new prompt (differences highlighted in bold) is: Photo of two Muppet characters: a pelican with a monocle and a bow tie, and a walrus with big, goofy tusks and a dapper bow tie. They’re seated in a Muppet-style commentary booth, providing humorous commentary on the Monaco Grand Prix. Cartoonish F1 cars race by, and colorful yachts are seen in the distance. So this really did work by adding a couple of extra details to the prompt and re-running it with the same seed as before. I’m really surprised that this works. I would expect even a single character difference in the prompt to produce wildly different results, no matter what seed was being fed to the image generator. DALL-E 3 doesn’t fit my mental model of how these things work at all. Midjourney and Stable Diffusion both have a “seed” concept, but as far as I know they don’t have anything like this capability to maintain consistency between images given the same seed and a slightly altered prompt. The leaked DALL-E prompt If you dig around in the JSON you’ll find a few examples like this that appear to reveal inner workings of the DALL-E/ChatGPT combo: \"DALL·E returned some images. They are already displayed to the user. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES list the DALL·E prompts or images in your response.\" It’s always amusing to see glimpses of OpenAI’s prompt engineering like this, in particular the way they use CAPITAL LETTERS for emphasis. Benj Edwards wrote about this the other day for Ars Technica. Does this mean there’s a larger prompt that tells ChatGPT how to use DALL-E? It turns out there is, and it can be leaked! Dustin Miller shared the extracted prompt here. (Every time a prompt like this leaks people question if it might be a hallucination. My experience is that these things are very unlikely to be hallucinated—LLMs are really good at repeating text from earlier in their context, and I have yet to see a documented case of a leaked prompt that turned out not to be correct. Here’s my own recreation of the leaked DALL-E prompt.) There’s a lot in there. Here are some highlights: Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create the images and then summarize the prompts used to generate the images in plain text. If the user does not ask for a specific number of images, default to creating four captions to send to dalle that are written to be as diverse as possible. That outlines the default behavior. Where things get really interesting is some of the stuff in the list of policies that follows: Don’t create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead. Don’t create images in the style of artists whose last work was created within the last 100 years (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). Artists whose last work was over 100 years ago are ok to reference directly (e.g. Van Gogh, Klimt). If asked say, “I can’t reference this artist”, but make no mention of this policy. Instead, apply the following procedure when creating the captions for dalle: (a) substitute the artist’s name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist. They have clearly trained the model on all sorts of copyrighted images—this is the part of the prompt where they discourage it from obviously recreating the work of living artists. Always mention the image type (photo, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, cartoon, drawing, vector, render, etc.) at the beginning of the caption. Unless the caption suggests otherwise, make at least 1--2 of the 4 images photos We saw this earlier where my first prompt was turned into a photo, watercolor, illustration and vector-style image. Diversify depictions of ALL images with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. EXPLICITLY specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. The attributes should be specified in a minimal way and should directly describe their physical form. Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. Use “various” or “diverse” ONLY IF the description refers to groups of more than 3 people. Do not change the number of people requested in the original description. Don’t alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt’s intent and prioritize quality. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations. Using prompt engineering in ChatGPT to get around the fundamental biases baked into the DALL-E 3 model! Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebritie by carefully selecting a few minimal modifications to substitute references to the people with generic descriptions that don’t divulge any information about their identities, except for their genders and physiques. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases: Modify such prompts even if you don’t know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. “Barake Obema”) If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. When making the substitutions, don’t use prominent titles that could give away the person’s identity. E.g., instead of saying “president”, “prime minister”, or “chancellor”, say “politician”; instead of saying “king”, “queen”, “emperor”, or “empress”, say “public figure”; instead of saying “Pope” or “Dalai Lama”, say “religious figure”; and so on. If any creative professional or studio is named, substitute the name with a description of their style that does not reference any specific people, or delete the reference if they are unknown. DO NOT refer to the artist or studio’s style. Another fascinating detail. What I love about these prompts is that they clearly developed over months of testing the model, and are designed to counter all manner of harmful or embarrassing capabilities of the underlying DALL-E 3. Finally, there’s this snippet of TypeScript at the end which describes the seed behavior we saw earlier on: namespace dalle { // Create images from a text-only prompt. type text2im = (_: { // The resolution of the requested image, which can be wide, square, or tall. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default unless the prompt suggests a wide image, 1792x1024, or a full-body portrait, in which case 1024x1792 (tall) should be used instead. Always include this parameter in the request. size?: \"1792x1024\"\"1024x1024\"\"1024x1792\", // The user's original image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user does not suggest a number of captions to create, create four of them. If creating multiple captions, make them as diverse as possible. If the user requested modifications to previous images, the captions should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the suggestions into each of the captions. Generate no more than 4 images, even if the user requests more. prompts: string[], // A list of seeds to use for each prompt. If the user asks to modify a previous image, populate this field with the seed used to generate that image from the image dalle metadata. seeds?: number[], }) => any; } // namespace dalle Key extract from that: If the user requested modifications to previous images, the captions should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the suggestions into each of the captions. All in all, this is a really neat insight into the kind of prompt engineering that goes on within OpenAI itself—likely the organization with the most experience of prompt engineering in the world.

The quality and creativity of Dalle3 beats Stable Diffusion (all models) but this fine grained control is missing. reply jallmann 9 hours agoprevVery interesting that ChatGPT seems to prompt Dall-E via the client, rather than keeping that interaction entirely server-side. Keeping it server-side would be less likely to leak details as seen here, and makes it less susceptible to tampering.Also nice to see that Dall-E 3 seeds were finally fixed. That must have happened within the last week or so; they weren&#x27;t working last I checked (chatgpt always used a fixed seed of 5000).> Midjourney and Stable Diffusion both have a “seed” concept, but as far as I know they don’t have anything like this capability to maintain consistency between images given the same seed and a slightly altered prompt.I suspect this is more a function of Midjourney&#x27;s prompt adherence being fairly poor right now.

ChatGPT&#x27;s DALL-E seems to create much more stylized images - much harder to get plain shots that don&#x27;t heavily embellish your description. reply TeMPOraL 3 hours agorootparentOpenAI justified that in a paper the other day, saying that DALL-E 3 performs better on longer, more detailed prompts describing all aspects of the image in rich language - so they put GPT-4 in front to expand the typical user&#x27;s short and vague prompt, so such users get nicer results by default.My own observation: this kind of hack is possible only since&#x2F;with GPT-4 - it takes an LLM this powerful to reliably extend and enrich arbitrary user input into much longer prompt, that&#x27;s coherent, consistent, and a plausible (to human) interpretation of the original input.Now this may fan the flames on the \"is it or is it not\" AI discussions, but: you could almost say that GPT-4 is engaging in creative process here. reply trompetenaccoun 9 hours agoparentprevMaybe I&#x27;m not their typical target demographic but OpenAI&#x27;s products are completely useless to me, the way they&#x27;ve neutered them and are restricting the output.

Just now VK Group announced their in-home game engine will be based on this code.I can guess that Gaijin Entertainment had some contracts with companies in Russia, but after moving their business out of Russia it&#x27;s now easiest way to fulfill the terms of some IP licensing deal.Yandex is doing the same thing, but other way around by releasing more and more of their code as open source.

It was a rule of a thumb of doing any IT business: register everything on Cyprus or in other functioning country. Usually regional office is only received money from holding company to pay for ads, pay salaries and minimal taxes.So unlike giants like Yandex they were never under Kremlin direct control and could withdraw out of country rapidly without any losses. reply kgeist 5 hours agorootparentAs far as I remember, formally, Yandex Russia is also a subsidiary of a company based in the Netherlands. reply SXX 4 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true, but majority of Yandex business was always inside Russia. Also Kremlin&#x27;s Sberbank held golden share in Yandex since 2019 to veto any changes in company they dont like.For game development companies like Gajin it was always just one of the markets even if important one. replyshakow 13 hours agoparentprev> has native linux supportIt does, a game or two of Warthunder are my guilty pleasure while waiting for some CI pipelines to finish. reply gpm 14 hours agoparentprevI would take from the commit messages that this is up to date as of Sunday. reply meheleventyone 14 hours agorootparentThis looks like Dagor 4 from that message whereas I think the latest version is 6? reply gpm 14 hours agorootparentTrue (at least google confirms that), but the files have headers that look like &#x2F;&#x2F; &#x2F;&#x2F; Dagor Engine 6.5 &#x2F;&#x2F; Copyright (C) 2023 Gaijin Games KFT.

They are trying to standardize on one engine that does not have ties with West.

This is true, but we shouldn&#x27;t allow it to break our language, no matter how much we love the clever meme! reply smoldesu 12 hours agorootparentprevProton includes DXVK, and that is a high-level emulator for DirectX by most definitions. Wine isn&#x27;t an emulator because it doesn&#x27;t have to be. replyglobalnode 3 hours agoprevNot wanting to sound too disrespectful (although I AM getting cranky about this issue), but I find a lot of open source projects on github that are at least moderately complex (which a game engine certainly is), are useless as-is. There is no documentation and it would likely be easier to just write your own code from scratch. I can see how if you get stuck with say quaternions then you may dive into another persons project to get some tips but even then, without documentation you&#x27;re better off just learning the math from a book and rewriting from scratch. reply w4rh4wk5 2 hours agoparentI&#x27;d say this is far from useless. Especially when building your own engine, you can look at other implementations and reuse elements that you need. The company I work for specializes in video game ports. Getting only the source code, without documentation, or a back-channel to ask questions on a regular basis is standard for us. Still, we manage to get by just fine.I am thankful for every piece of code that is opened up, especially when it&#x27;s published under a permissive license.The devs likely don&#x27;t have any intentions to build &#x2F; support a community around this release, which is perfectly fine. No one is stopping you from building your project &#x2F; community around it either.Think about it like Doom &#x2F; Quake engines, they are pretty popular as well, but didn&#x27;t come with a lot of documentation or support from id software. reply CrimsonCape 12 hours agoprevAny idea why Gaijin has developed two fully-featured scripting languages? I see Quirrel and daScript in their Github page. reply versteegen 10 hours agoparentThey fill two different niches, daScript is statically typed, AoT compiled and attempting to outperform LuaJIT, Quirrel is dynamically typed and better for writing game logic.Note that Quirrel is a fork of Squirrel (in early 2019), which is a language very heavily inspired by Lua (you could say Lua-done-over) with a very similar embedding API, but much more like a typical OO language rather than quirky (which makes it very similar to Javascript). Squirrel was most famous used by many Valve games like Portal 2 and L4D2, and I recommend it. Quirrel attempts to make Squirrel more Python-like, easier, add tooling like static analysis and tests, and to continue development, as Squirrel has only received the odd bugfix for years and been neglected. I&#x27;ve been watching Quirrel for years, and development has been picking up. They seem to have about 1.5-2 people working on it fulltime. The language is diverging more and more from Squirrel (and further towards Python) and getting bigger. reply MindSpunk 10 hours agoparentprevQuirrel is, as far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell, a fork of Squirrel. daScript is all their work though. reply corysama 11 hours agoparentprevI would guess a combination of tech evolution, legacy code and disagreements between design departments. I once worked at a gamedev company that had an in-house scripting system and a purchased system from an engine fire-sale (not a fire-engine sale). The in-house one was better for complicated situations, but was relatively a lot of work for large volumes of simple situations. reply Eduard 10 hours agoprev\"Dagor Engine and Tools source code from Gaijin Games KFT\".For anyone wondering about this word soup: KFT == kft. == \"korlátolt felelősségű társaság\" == Hungarian limited liability company.\"Gaijin Games\" is a Hungarian kft. reply euos 9 hours agoparentSure.

And especially for games where modding is encouraged the lack of OS releases is surprising. reply bayindirh 14 hours agoparentA lot of black magic is done in game engines to get that level of performance with that level of quality.Carmack always (ab)used the hardware to the highest level in its code to get that performance&#x2F;quality ratio and this is why he always kept the latest engine closed.Unreal engine also had tricks up on its sleeve since Unreal Tournament days, however I don’t know the exact details. IIRC, it was about lighting and shadows mostly.I had two friends who wrote their own engines. One built a company around that. Other one did visual simulations. Former one told me about the war stories which he battled against NVIDIA drivers, how driver behave the way it wanted, and how he had to abuse it to get the performance it wants. Also both AMD and NVIDIA drivers sometimes implement alternate paths to fix some engines’ performance and artifacts.He also told how some big studios’ developers abused the driver in a way which can be only defined as “hacking”. I don’t remember the details, but they modified some data in place to bypass the graphics APIs to gain performance. Of course that is pretty brittle.Latter friend told me how he had to optimize calculations, do great yet cheap approximations and abuse the strong parts of a GPU to get the performance he wanted.So, a lot. All of these are considered black art and trade secret. Crytek should have some patents about some of the rendering methods they have developed even. They stopped sharing tech demos to prevent being copied, too. reply dleslie 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve worked on games where a static reference is found in the host libraries, and that&#x27;s used as an offset to stomp on the unnecessary parts of the library provided by the vendor; and therefore recover slivers of precious console memory space for the game. reply corysama 12 hours agorootparentIIRC, Andy Gavin said during the development of Crash Bandicoot, he stomped pages in the Sony system&#x2F;OS libraries.

An interesting artefact of this (or maybe the specific tricks that Nvidia chooses) is that Nvidia&#x27;s cards need to be paired with a strong CPU, or you can suffer a performance penalty of up to 25%. reply SpaghettiCthulu 12 hours agorootparentHow are those two things related? reply bayindirh 12 hours agorootparentDriver interrupts the engine instructions, applies fixes or other does other processing on the CPU, and renders the modified code.

Further to that open sourcing software takes effort and the more complex the software the more effort it takes. Game engines are very complex. Then for most companies they are trying to make and ship games which is also pretty hard. So open sourcing seems like a lot of work for little return. That’s often why engines that become open source are general at their end of life from a commercial perspective.Games with modding in mind often do open source relevant bits to make modding easier. reply Cthulhu_ 13 hours agoparentprevClones with more marketing budget &#x2F; scummy promotion behind it.

Car and flight enthusiast sim people absolutely do shop for physics, flight model, and so on to some extent.I don&#x27;t know where on the spectrum from casual to enthusiast sim War Thunder is.

October 2023 0 Historic agreement on child sexual abuse proposal (CSAR): European Parliament wants to remove chat control and safeguard secure encryption EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY AND TRANSPARENCY PRESS RELEASES This week, the European Parliament’s negotiators reached a broad majority agreement on a common position concerning the controversial EU chat control bill. The Commission’s bill proposes bulk scanning and reporting of private messages for allegedly suspicious content by using error-prone algorithms, including „artificial intelligence“. But the European Parliament’s position removes indiscriminate chat control and allows only for a targeted surveillance of specific individuals and groups reasonably suspicious of being linked to child sexual abuse material, with a judicial warrant. End-to-end encrypted messengers are exempted. Instead, internet services will have to design their services more securely and thus effectively prevent the sexual exploitation of children. EU lawmaker Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, a digital freedom fighter who negotiated the parliamentary position on behalf of his group Greens/EFA, explains: “Under the impression of massive protests against the looming indiscriminate chat control mass scanning of private messages, we managed to win a broad majority for a different, new approach to protecting young people from abuse and exploitation online. As a pirate and digital freedom fighter, I am proud of this breakthrough. The winners of this agreement are on the one hand our children, who will be protected much more effectively and in a court-proof manner, and on the other hand all citizens, whose digital privacy of correspondence and communication security will be guaranteed. Even if this compromise, which is supported from the progressive to the conservative camp, is not perfect on all points, it is a historic success that removing chat control and rescuing secure encryption is the common aim of the entire Parliament. We are doing the exact opposite of most EU governments who want to destroy digital privacy of correspondence and secure encryption. Governments must finally accept that this highly dangerous bill can only be fundamentally changed or not be passed at all. The fight against authoritarian chat control must be pursued with all determination! In detail, our position will protect young people and victims of abuse much more effectively than the EU Commission’s extreme proposal: Security by design: In order to protect young people from grooming, internet services and apps shall be secure by design and default. It must be possible to block and report other users. Only at the request of the user should he or she be publicly addressable and see messages or pictures of other users. Users should be asked for confirmation before sending contact details or nude pictures. Potential perpetrators and victims should be warned where appropriate, for example if they try to search for abuse material using certain search words. Public chats at high risk of grooming are to be moderated. In order to clean the net of child sexual abuse material, the new EU Child Protection Centre is to proactively search publicly accessible internet content automatically for known CSAM. This crawling can also be used in the darknet and is thus more effective than private surveillance measures by providers. Providers who become aware of clearly illegal material will be obliged to remove it – unlike in the EU Commission’s proposal. Law enforcement agencies who become aware of illegal material must report it to the provider for removal. This is our reaction to the case of the darknet platform Boystown, where the worst abuse material was further disseminated for months with the knowledge of Europol. At the same time, we are pulling the following poisonous teeth out of the EU Commission’s extreme bill: We safeguard the digital secrecy of correspondence and remove the plans for blanket chat control, which violate fundamental rights and stand no chance in court. The current voluntary chat control of private messages (not social networks) by US internet companies is being phased out. Targeted telecommunication surveillance and searches will only be permitted with a judicial warrant and only limited to persons or groups of persons suspected of being linked to child sexual abuse material. We safeguard trust in secure end-to-end encryption. We clearly exclude so-called client-side scanning, i.e. the installation of surveillance functionalities and security vulnerabilities in our smartphones. We guarantee the right to anonymous communication and remove mandatory age verification for users of communication services. Whistleblowers can thus continue to leak wrong-doings anonymously without having to show their identity card or face. Removing instead of blocking: Internet access blocking will be optional. Under no circumstances must legal content be collaterally blocked. We prevent the digital house arrest: We don’t oblige app stores to prevent young people under 16 from installing messenger apps, social networking and gaming apps ‘for their own protection’ as proposed. The General Data Protection Regulation is maintained.” The EU Parliament’s civil liberties committee is due to confirm the agreement on 13 November. 20 November 2023: Announcement in plenary (likely no vote on substance) 4 December 2023: Envisaged Adoption of Partial General Approach by EU Council (tbc) after 2024 EU elections: Envisaged trilogue negotiations of the final text of the legislation between Commission, Parliament and Council, as well as adoption of the result TAGS: Chatcontrol child pornography back to archive Related topics 26.

I would assume targeted surveillance, without requiring 3rd parties sabotage the security of their products, is already a legal law enforcement procedure? reply ponderings 15 hours agorootparentThe EU standardizes a lot of laws that a lot of countries should have had already. I&#x27;m sure there must be bad examples but I&#x27;ve really only seen improvements in action. Countries have to part with their idiotic version or give up on their idiotic proposals. NL for example had some issues wanting forced labor for unemployed people with social support but that would be called a job and require minimum wage. reply derefr 15 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t have to be different from the status quo. EU law acts upon member countries like the US federal constitution acts upon member states: it prevent individual members from ever changing their own laws to take more extreme positions than the recognized consensus position. reply g-b-r 12 hours agorootparentTo my knowledge EU Regulations are simply laws that overrule local EU countries&#x27; laws, so whether it&#x27;s possible or not for local laws to be more extreme only depends on such laws being at odds with what the Regulation prescribes (but I&#x27;m not a lawyer and only looked into that years ago). reply bmicraft 9 hours agorootparentFrom what I&#x27;ve been told how it actually works is that eu law doesn&#x27;t apply directly to member states, but member states are required to amend their laws to be at least as strict as eu laws on all matters. reply g-b-r 8 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s not a single type of EU laws, there are \"regulations\" and \"directives\".Regulations are complete laws applicable immediately across the EU as they stand, the states are required to amend any conflicting law but the regulations already automatically prevail on any conflicting local law.Directives instead need to be transposed into local law by each state individually, and can leave many details to the individual implementations. reply vaylian 14 hours agorootparentprevCorrect. But the chatcontrol proposal would have changed that. The proposed law mandates untargeted surveillance and bypassing of encryption through client-side scanning. reply ExoticPearTree 13 hours agorootparentprevThe status quo now is that each country does as it sees fit.

Why would anyone care about circumventing a \"Are you sure?\" dialog? reply pmontra 3 hours agorootparentThere are many ways to share contact details. One is to use an app provided mechanism, which can ask confirmation about sending and receiving contacts. Another one is to just type them into a message. The confirmation of the intention to send is implicit but no confirmation is possible at the receiving end: they read the message and get the contact, willing or unwilling. All they can do is delete it before remembering it and report the other party. There is a provision about reporting unwanted interactions.About circumvention, one could think about a way to detect contact details in messages. There are several problems with that.1. If it warns the sender, the sender will try another way until the obfuscated contact passes unnoticed (text, image, vocal, link, whatever.)2. If it automatically reports the sender there will be many false positives, some due to copy and paste, keyboard autocompletion, etc.3.

My impression is that lobbyists have worked for this through the European commission - which is distasteful as it should never have been proposed. But it never stood a chance in the parliament.

Or this is crazy talk, not sure which one it is :) reply raxxorraxor 3 hours agorootparentThat isn&#x27;t a good development at all. Problem is that this distance isn&#x27;t realized for large interest groups. This bill is an example. It is still on the menu despite numerous lobbying attempts have been made public.The EU shifted power from voters to larger groups with particular interests. Those groups have the resources to address people in Brussels, while voters have more or less no voice or impact.This is a structural problem. reply attah_ 14 hours agorootparentprevToo far removed or just too technologically inept?

It was the start of an 11-hour, 1,146-km (712-mile) crazy journey, that took the bird 15,000 feet higher than normal, at three times its usual speed, on a ride that his species are quite good at avoiding. Happily, the bird survived and eventually returned to his feathered friends with quite the story to tell. Thanks to GPS bio-loggers that had been attached to 14 adult streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas) seabirds in August that year by Tohoku University biologist Kozue Shiomi to track nesting behaviors, scientists were lucky enough to have a record of this nuts nature-defying act, spotting a huge flight pattern anomaly that coincided with the storm. MORE STORIES BIOLOGY Who you callin' bird-brained? Pigeons learn the same way AI models do MEDICAL RNA-binding proteins discovered to be key to severe asthma While it didn’t affect the other birds, one male managed to get caught up in the atmospheric drama, though researchers can’t say if he had a daredevil streak or was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. But one thing is for certain: the 585-g (1.3-lb) bird didn't have much choice but to 'go with the flow.' Throughout the 11-hour epic flight, the bird completed five full loops in circles ranging from 50-80 km (31-50 miles) in diameter, which tracked with the typhoon’s rotation and movement. While the shearwaters usually fly below 100 m (328 ft), this brazen bird found himself in entirely new territory, soaring at an altitude of 4,700 m (15,420 ft). For context, small aircraft fly between 600 and 3,000 m (2,000 and 10,000 feet). All the while, the bird was zipping along at 90-170 km/h (56-106 mph). Given that these birds generally cruise at 10-60 km/h (6-37 mph), at his top speed, our aerial adventurer was probably flying on a wing and a prayer. The bird took a less-than-scenic route over mainland Japan before being carried back out above the Pacific Ocean as the typhoon swung out to sea. At this point, with the storm’s power subsiding, the bird resumed normal transmission and no doubt had some explaining to do when he returned to his flock over the water near the nesting island. Not as the crow flies: Scientists were able to track the loopy 11-hour journey of the GPS-tagged 'rider on the storm'ESA The GPS timeline shows how the bird was, for a while, in the eye of the storm, but then ended up flying in larger loops outside of it. It also had a delayed departure time, which scientists note is unusual for the species. “The early evening departure of the bird from the breeding area was also unusual for this species, which usually departs for foraging during several hours before sunrise,” the researchers noted. “This might indicate that the bird attempted to circumnavigate the harsh conditions in advance but failed.” They note that it’s impossible to know how much of this journey was planned, but it's just as likely the bird could have opted out of the trip but chose to ‘ride’ the storm instead. Regardless, looking at this wild ride highlights the increasing risks that seabird populations could face as climate change drives more extreme weather events. Pelagic birds have many different ways to avoid run-ins with severe weather systems, yet increasingly larger and more frequent storms will likely challenge their skill and resilienceDepositphotos Pelagic birds, like this streaked shearwater, spend most of their lives over the open ocean, flying to land only to breed. They have a wide range of inclement weather avoidance mechanisms and behaviors, varying from staying in the eye of a storm to ascending to high altitudes above the disturbance. However, more frequent, larger hurricanes are making it an increasingly difficult task for many species of birds to combat. Shiomi noted that more research into how pelagic birds are dealing with more extreme weather events is vital, in order to see if and how these species are responding to the rapid changes. The research was published in the journal Ecology.

Maybe the bird knows how to navigate it, but it&#x27;s not a safe environment for balloons like people used as example downthread. reply mongol 14 hours agoparentprevYeah. I imagine it is like a ballon that blows away with the wind. To it, there is no wind. Just the ground is moving away below it. reply natoliniak 13 hours agorootparentbut wouldn&#x27;t the wind exert some pressure on the back of the bird? wouldn&#x27;t it not generate any lift otherwise and just drop back to the ground? like sails on a sailboat, for the sailors it feels like there is no wind, but the sails are carrying massive pressure reply stouset 12 hours agorootparentIf you’re in a boat in a river, your “natural” speed is the speed of the river. Same with air.You point about a sailboat and wind is confused; the pressure comes from the fact that the boat is traveling at one speed through the water and at a different speed through the air. reply natoliniak 11 hours agorootparentok, if the bird&#x27;s natural speed is that of the ambient air, then how does it stay up? the bird is not lighter than air, so where does the upwards pressure on the bird come from? either the bird must flap its wings to stay up or there must be speed difference between the bird and the ambient air to generate lift. reply stouset 6 hours agorootparentThere is a speed difference between birds and the ambient air. Birds don&#x27;t just drift aimlessly with the wind, they flap their wings and gain airspeed. But from their perspective, the \"speed\" at which they&#x27;re flying is entirely relative to the mass of air, and not the ground.This isn&#x27;t some mystery, it&#x27;s the same way boats and planes work. Consider a plane flying at 100 knots of airspeed. If the mass of air they&#x27;re in is moving perpendicular to the plane at 50 knots, the plane will track diagonally across the ground even though it&#x27;s pointed forward. The plane won&#x27;t experience side loads because it&#x27;s tracking 50 units sideways (with respect to the ground) for every 100 units it moves forwards, the exact same as the \"wind\". If the plane is instead in a 100 knot headwind, it will be stationary with respect to the ground. It won&#x27;t drop out of the air, but it also won&#x27;t make headway to its destination either.From a mechanics perspective, neither the plane nor the bird care about what the ground is doing once they&#x27;re airborne. The only thing they care about is the mass of air they&#x27;re aloft in. reply tw04 11 hours agorootparentprevIf the bird’s natural speed is 7mph, and the tail wind is 7mph, the bird is still flying at 7mph airspeed, its ground speed just increases to 14mph.No different than a jet flying with or against the jet stream.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;science.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;transport&#x2F;flight&#x2F;modern&#x2F;ai... reply natoliniak 11 hours agorootparentthat is my point - in order to stay up, the bird would need to either flap its wings for 700 miles non-stop (unlikely) in order to maintain velocity difference between it and the ambient air OR glide which basically means he was not traveling at the speed of ambient air, otherwise there would be no lift pressure generated on his wings and he would drop to the ground reply hansvm 11 hours agorootparentIgnore the storm for a moment, and ask whether a bird can fly for 7h+, either from flapping, gliding, or navigating updrafts. The answer is yes, that&#x27;s trivial for many many bird species, especially those with a propensity for ocean travel. The storm then just changes the baseline ground speed. reply my12parsecs 3 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s stuff like dynamic soaring that Albatrosses use to travel thousands of miles over the ocean using little energy.Some enthusiasts use this to make RC gliders go really fast, and the record is over 500 mph.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dynamic_soaring replyHPsquared 12 hours agorootparentprevA sailboat uses the speed difference between the water (basically stationary) and the wind. A bird (or sailplane) just moves along with the wind. Birds and sailplanes can however hang around areas of rising air to overcome their natural sink rate. reply mongol 13 hours agorootparentprevThe comparison with the balloon is perhaps not entirely accurate since birds like you say, fly using lift from the wings. So they need to have some relative speed vs the air. reply lxgr 12 hours agorootparentThe point is that as long as the entire body of air the bird is flying through is moving uniformly and without acceleration, it&#x27;s perceptually indistinguishable from calm air (except visually, and even that only when flying pretty low).For rotating and turbulent air, which would both not be totally unheard of in a hurricane, this probably doesn&#x27;t apply though. reply quickthrower2 12 hours agorootparentThis is probably like when you swim out at the beach, and back and find you are 20m away from where you started due to currents. But you didn’t feel it.With dead reckoning you could probably figure out. reply lxgr 11 hours agorootparentYou can’t feel linear&#x2F;unaccelerated motion, and biological organisms aren’t great at indirectly deriving it from acceleration and rotation over time the way inertial navigation systems do. reply stouset 5 hours agorootparentHell, even those have a hard time doing it without experiencing drift! So they periodically re-establish a baseline using something like GPS. reply atq2119 9 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t really matter in this case, but hummingbirds would like to have a word with you. reply _moof 12 hours agorootparentprevWhen you&#x27;re flying, wind is no longer the air moving over the ground, it&#x27;s the ground moving under the air. It doesn&#x27;t produce acceleration except for a brief moment when you leave the ground. reply cratermoon 9 hours agorootparentprevIf your stall speed is 6mph and the winds are 100mph, you can fly into the wind at just above stall speed and still be doing 94mph tailfeathers-first. reply orliesaurus 13 hours agoprev> the bird resumed normal transmission and no doubt had some explaining to do when he returned to his flock over the water near the nesting island.as a dad joke appreciator, i love whoever wrote this reply nomel 12 hours agoparentIncredible that it never lost its bearings. reply bsder 12 hours agorootparentTo me, that is WAY more impressive (so is the 4700m altitude!).

They have air sacs in front of and behind the lungs that take up a significant portion of their body cavity. The lungs themselves don&#x27;t expand or compress. Air moves unidirectionally through the lungs both during inhalation and exhalation so there is no time at which the lungs themselves are not operating optimally. It is a two-phase system... during inhalation the posterior air sac fills with fresh air as spent air accumulates in the anterior air sac. The effective blood gas exchange surface area is about double that of mammals as well.Basically: bird lungs are \"pipelined\" and highly optimized to extract oxygen even at altitude. reply euroderf 24 minutes agorootparentDo we know whether this is also a feature of dinosaur lungs ?

    "originBody": "Skip to content The Eyewall Seeing you through the storm HOME ABOUT US PREPAREDNESS MORE LINKS CONTACT US Trying to make sense of why Otis exploded en route to Acapulco this week October 26, 2023 at 6:55 am by Matt Lanza One-sentence summary Scroll to the bottom for a couple notes on current weather, but in today’s post, I want to try to make some sense of what just happened in Mexico this week. Otis’s catastrophic rapid intensification: What happened? In general, I think Eric did a good job yesterday sort of conveying the general shock many of us in the meteorology community had with regard to Hurricane Otis. The word “unprecedented” gets tossed around a little too fast and loose these days, but truly, this was without any real precedent in Acapulco. And it was with only slight precedent anywhere in terms of how quickly it intensified. Courtesy of Dr. Kim Wood, University of Arizona Otis was the textbook definition of rapid intensification (RI), going from a 50 mph tropical storm on Monday evening to a 165 mph category 5 hurricane last night. Look at the change in Otis between Sunday evening and Tuesday evening, 48 hours apart. You can see the intensification chart to the right of the satellite loop. Through about mid-morning on Tuesday, everything was going basically as you’d expect for a modest hurricane with Otis. It may have been tracking toward a category 2 type landfall, or even a category 3 type landfall in a worst case, if you assumed the general rules of RI in this region. Much like an onion, there are layers to this story that are important. First, take it from one of the more seasoned hurricane hunters, this was not what they expected when they flew their mission on Tuesday. Jeremy DeHart on the platform formerly known as Twitter And this was before Otis had peaked. The typical satellite-derived intensity values often used to “proxy” intensity of storms that are far away from reconnaissance flights failed in this case to grasp how intense Otis was. In other words, Otis intensified so quickly that it basically outran the ability to measure how intense it actually was. Here was the raw model output for Otis from Tuesday morning. This is what general weather forecasters would use to assess what the models assume will happen with a storm’s wind forecast. The dashed line is what actually occurred. Otis’s model forecasts on Tuesday early morning were nowhere remotely close to what happened. (Tomer Burg on Twitter) None of the best, most reliable tropical modeling had Otis as a hurricane, let alone a category 5 storm. To put it bluntly, this was an absolutely catastrophic forecast failure. Even the National Hurricane Center by late Tuesday morning had it at 90 mph making landfall, well above any forecast data, and they concluded in their discussion that it seemed reasonable to potentially see further intensification adjustments before landfall. So even in the worst case scenario, the NHC forecast would have still been off by probably two categories less than 18 hours before landfall. And this was using strong meteorological analysis to bias correct the models upward too. And to their credit, they had it at 140 mph by the late afternoon advisory. Interestingly, one of the tools we use to forecast the probability that a storm will rapidly intensify, SHIPS guidance, failed also. Early on Tuesday morning it only showed about a 2-3x above normal chance that the storm would intensify from a 50 mph tropical storm to a 100-125 mph hurricane. Yes, that is above climatology, but it’s not exactly anything impressive given what we’ve seen in recent years. By Tuesday afternoon, those odds had increased to 5-9x above normal. But even this only showed 2x above normal odds that we’d get to 140 mph+. There were finally some hints available by mid to late morning on Tuesday, but nothing that would have offered a meaningful forecast improvement over what the NHC had (which called for 20-30 mph of intensification over 12-24 hours). SHIPS rapid intensification forecast guidance from Tuesday midday showed about 9x greater than normal probability of 50 mph of intensity gain, which at that point would have meant a category 2 or 3 storm. The odds of something truly massive were still only about 2x above normal. (UCAR) So the first question is, why did Otis do what it did? Probably a combination of a couple things. First, Otis was placed ideally in an environment that facilitated constructive wind shear. When we discuss wind shear it’s usually referenced in a negative sense; wind shear inhibits and destroys storms. Well, in occasional cases, as we’ve witnessed in the Gulf with Ian, Delta, Zeta, among many other storms in recent years, the wind shear can actually be constructive and help ‘vent’ the system. In this case, Otis was optimally placed in the right entrance region of the jet stream. An analysis map from the GFS model showing jet stream winds on Tuesday morning. Otis (circled) is tenuously placed in the right entrance region of the jet stream, which tends to offer a more favorable environment for intensification. (Tropical Tidbits) Storms are aided in intensification when placed in the left front or right rear (entrance) of the jet stream. Why? In that portion of the jet stream, the winds aloft diverge, meaning they either are moving in opposite directions or stronger wind is diverging away from weaker wind. Upper level divergence leads to rising air. Rising air is necessary for storms to form and maintain, and thus surface pressures tend to fall in this region of the jet stream as well. A conceptual model of a jet streak showing that the right entrance region (bottom left quadrant) is supportive of upper level divergence and surface pressure falls (Penn State University) Otis wasn’t exactly square in the middle of the right entrance region, but it was there. Additionally, Otis tracked right over an area of 31°C sea surface temperatures. Sea surface temperatures were close to 31°C over Otis’s path, which is a few degrees above normal. While not the primary cause of Otis’s rapid intensification, they did not hurt. (Brian McNoldy on Twitter) This rich warm water did not hurt matters at all. So how did every reliable model we use miss this? That’s for graduate students and researchers to answer in the coming years, because I have no formal idea. There was something about Otis that models just could not capture and translate to RI. Human forecasters, recognizing the setup were able to mitigate some but not all of the underforecast issue. Otis’s smaller size may have also contributed. My hunch is also that if Otis had tracked, say 30-40 miles east or west of where it was, it would not have gone off to the races like this. It was simply perfectly placed to optimize intensification. A less sexy explanation? Otis was almost unprecedented in the historical record. Only Hurricane Patricia in the Pacific in 2015 had a greater rate of RI than Otis. And in the modern era no massive storm has hit Acapulco. Otis was not the fastest rapidly intensifying storm on record, but it was near the top of the list in the East Pacific, lagging only 2015’s Patricia. (Tomer Burg on Twitter) Unprecedented outcomes are just that, and if the historical record has only one other remotely comparable event in this region, it becomes tough to expect that modeling can “capture” the concept that this would occur in this environment. It feels like this was a combination of bad luck, bad timing, and bad placement. And it just so happened that a metropolitan area with over 1 million people was in the way. It’s easy to sit here and pontificate about this or to say that weather forecasts are often wrong. But the thing is, they’re not. They’re often right. With hurricanes, forecasting has improved by leaps and bounds in the last 20 to 30 years. Perfect? No, but often more than acceptable. A failure like this shocks us because we aren’t actually used to forecast failures of this magnitude anymore! 100 years ago? Sure, this was fairly routine. But in the 2020s, we have standards and expectations for weather forecasts, and clearly this was a shock to the system. Busts like this remind us that it’s an imperfect business and there is still much work to do. The work to be done to understand Otis will take time, but we will certainly see many research papers in the coming years. Weather update: Tammy, Texas rain, and continued wintry weather north Just a quick punch list of items we’ll be watching over the next few days. Hurricane Tammy’s final advisory was issued this morning, as it has transitioned into an extratropical entity, or something akin to a strong nor’easter. It will meander east of Bermuda for a few days, and there is some chance this could reacquire tropical characteristics at some point. It won’t go quietly, but hopefully any impacts to Bermuda are minimal. Post-tropical Tammy will remain a strong storm for several more days as it meanders east of Bermuda. (Tomer Burg) Flash flooding concerns will be in the forecast in the southern Plains over the next few days, meandering from Texas into Arkansas. Generally 3 to 5 inches of rain is possible in spots. But higher amounts are a virtual certainty. South of Dallas, the 24 hour rainfall totals in Hood and Somervell Counties are estimated to be close to 10 inches. Rain totals southwest of Dallas and Fort Worth are estimated to be close to 10 inches (purple) over the last 24 hours. (NOAA NSSL) Numerous flash flood warnings are posted in North Texas and Hill Country this morning as heavy rain falls and spreads south and east. Snow will continue in the northern tier. Over a foot fell in Helena, Montana, with snow spreading into North Dakota. Snow should wind down tonight from west to east. A bunch of items will impact the interior U.S. over the next 3 to 7 days, ranging from heavy snow in the Rockies to heavy rain in the mid-Mississippi Valley to hazardous cold in the North. (NOAA WPC) The hazards map from the Weather Prediction Center is lit up for days 3 to 7 with cold infiltrating from Canada this weekend in the North, the aforementioned heavy rain in mid-Mississippi Valley, and frost and freeze risk from near the Permian Basin and southern New Mexico across to the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys.

Intensity forecasts however, remain a challenge. There are so many examples to choose from, Harvey for instance. The track was spot on, the intensity, not so much. Harvey was forecasted to be a strong TS at best. Instead it blew up into a 4 and could’ve made a run for category 5 if it had a few more hours over water. Reply Lisa October 26, 2023 at 7:36 am Is this scenario possible to happen near Houston, Miami, New York, New Orleans, etc? Or near other major cities in Mexico? If so, I hope the meteorologists do dissect this case study and *hopefully* find a root cause for what happened. A storm that intensifies like that over Galveston/Houston with 12 hours of warning would be very, very bad. Also, poor Acapulco. Very little media coverage about it and I’m sure they are desperate for life-saving equipment and supplies. I hope their emergency response teams are able to save lives.

Weather models have been made in a climate somewhat different than the current one and those models are relatively accurate when modeling the past. As more data rolls in about anomalies like this the models will get updated and they&#x27;ll become more accurate again in specific cases that are outliers right now, but they may end up slightly less accurate overall (due to the increased bandwidth of possible outcomes). This happens in almost every field where modeling is used to predict complex systems. You can&#x27;t guarantee both great performance on past data and great performance on data that you haven&#x27;t seen yet, there is always the risk that you&#x27;ve lost generality as you increased accuracy. reply uticus 11 hours agoprev> So how did every reliable model we use miss this?

An eye became apparent on visible satellite images only a few hours ago, embedded in very deep convection. An Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft penetrated the eye around 1900 UTC and again around 2000 UTC, and found that the maximum sustained winds had increased to near 110 kt over a very small area near the center, while the central pressure remarkably dropped around 10 mb from the first to the second center fix. The intensity of Otis is well above the Dvorak satellite estimates, and again underscores the value of aerial reconnaissance in monitoring hurricanes.Otis should remain in an atmospheric and oceanic environment that will be conducive for further strengthening later today and tonight. Vertical wind shear should not be too strong, with SSTs near 30 deg C. Based on the observed changes, the short-term official intensity forecast remains above the model guidance. The system is now forecast to be at extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane status by the time it reaches the coast of southern Mexico late tonight or tomorrow morning. After landfall, the system should weaken rapidly over the mountainous terrain of Mexico.The hurricane continues on about the same heading, or around 330&#x2F;7 kt. For the next couple of days, Otis should move between a mid-level ridge to the east and northeast and a trough to its northwest. The official track forecast is about the same as the previous one and is a little faster than the dynamical consensus. On this track, the center of the hurricane will make landfall within the hurricane warning area late tonight or early Wednesday. reply atum47 6 hours agoprevanybody else getting blocked by cloudflare? reply downWidOutaFite 10 hours agoprevThere&#x27;s something going on over there: \"From October 9 to October 25, western Mexico has been hit by FOUR consecutive eastern North Pacific tropical cyclones. \" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;DrKimWood&#x2F;status&#x2F;1717557808147943922I found this analysis more comprehensive https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yaleclimateconnections.org&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;nightmare-scenari... reply Applejinx 11 hours agoprev [–] For a weather forecaster this is a really strange take.Anybody who understands what the big words &#x27;climate change&#x27; mean, could have predicted this. HAVE predicted this. I personally have predicted this and I&#x27;m not even a weather forecaster, I just know what chaos theory is.Adding energy to the system produces a wider range of possible outcomes. This is absolutely one of the possible outcomes.A few degrees less warming and it might not have been possible.Chaos is STRANGE. It&#x27;s sensitive to initial conditions. One of those conditions is the total energy in the system. This is what happens when you add a few degrees to the whole planet. It&#x27;ll act normal, sort of, maybe for quite a while… then bam.Because this is what you get when you add energy to a chaotic system the size of a planet, and it will happen again. We just got a picture of the new range of possible event… or of something WITHIN the new range of possible event, which by no means is guaranteed to be the most dramatic climate outcome currently possible.This was probably on the high end of possible events but might not even be the most extreme thing that can now happen with this level of climate energy.Climate energy is still increasing. reply foobarbecue 11 hours agoparentWhile I admire your ardor, and agree with you that anthropogenic global warming is a serious problem, your explanation lacks a specific mechanism, and the disrespect you show towards the experts is reprehensible.I found these facts in the article interesting:- This is not actually unprecedented -- hurricane Patricia in 2015 did the same thing, more intensely.- \"Sea surface temperatures were close to 31°C over Otis’s path, which is a few degrees above normal. While not the primary cause of Otis’s rapid intensification, they did not hurt.\"- Unusual placement of the hurricane relative to the jet stream seems to be the main cause(Geography BA, Earth science PhD) reply bombcar 10 hours agorootparentAnd even if completely true, it’s a useless factoid - we need to understand the physics of how these things work and are working and are changing if we want to continue to predict them accurately. reply dillydogg 10 hours agorootparentprevI must agree with you about disrespecting the experts. All of the best models created by the best meteorologists&#x2F;climatologists suggested this wasn&#x27;t going to come to pass. This was an extreme happening and brushing it off as rudimentary chaos theory is not useful.Some of the weather people I see on Mastodon were talking about how this was a freak happening, but the article helped me understand that better. Forecasting hurricanes has gotten remarkably good, so this was surprising to me. reply hedora 7 hours agorootparentprevMy reading of the article was that this (and most above average hurricanes these days) was probably due to climate change, since the ocean was warmer than usual, etc. However, repeating that isn’t particularly interesting. In other news, it is 2023.The interesting question then is why all the models screwed up so badly. Is it because climate change means the model is now inaccurate, or was this within the baseline (no climate change) error rate of current weather prediction technology?Quoting the article:> This rich warm water did not hurt matters at all.> So how did every reliable model we use miss this? reply cagenut 10 hours agorootparentprevtechnically correct! the best kind of correct! reply anigbrowl 11 hours agoparentprevI agree with all of this except the first sentence. Weather people understand all this too, but forecasters were genuinely shocked by the speed of the transition from tropical storm to cat 5 - a process that they&#x27;re used to observing over days suddenly took place within hours. Knowing a thing and seeing&#x2F;experiencing it directly are very different.I&#x27;m shocked myself by the degree of devastation, and suspect the reported death toll is low. Some of the damage can be ascribed to corruption and lax building codes, But the sight of multiple recently constructed high rise buildings completely trashed has to be sending a cold chill down the spines of insurers and emergency planners. reply peteradio 9 hours agorootparentSometimes you roll 6 6s and that&#x27;s a yahtzee, same thing in nature.

Power is work per unit of time, and is measured in watts; Energy is better expressed in joules, calories, or kilowatt hours (kWh). To be technically correct, I should say that the earth is getting about 300 terawatt hours of energy per hour due to anthropogenic climate change, and humans use about 16 terawatt hours of energy per hour. The ratio is still approximately 18.Out of interest, you can also convert it to calories. 1kWh is about 0.8 million calories.

Is there a way to apply climate change modelling to short-term weather modelling? Change the forecasting from \"we expect such-and-such to happen because that&#x27;s the most common case over the past 50 years\" to something like \"in the past we&#x27;d expect such-and-such to happen but including more recent work we expect a different thing\"? reply rokkitmensch 9 hours agoparentprevModelistas continue to struggle with infrequent events.
