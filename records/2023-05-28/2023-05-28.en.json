The films are considered dense with meaning and subtext, therefore it may take several attempts to fully appreciate them. Tarkovsky faced interference from the Soviet government during his filmmaking career. Some users point out the influence of Tarkovsky's work on modern film and video games, while others suggest starting with his diploma film, \"The Steamroller and the Violin.\" Overall, the post is a discussion of Tarkovsky's work, particularly his sci-fi films, and recommendations on how to approach them.The discussion on the HN thread revolves around the work of Andrei Tarkovsky and his movies such as Solaris, Stalker, and Mirror, among others. The thread also touches upon the differences between the movie adaptation and the book, which are both quite different. The comments discuss the slower pace of Tarkovsky's work and some even provide links to free, high-quality versions of his movies available for online viewing. There is also a brief discussion on Mosfilm, the production company that worked on Tarkovsky's films, and the political nature of the company.The Mosfilm YouTube channel has made several classic films by Andrei Tarkovsky available for free streaming, including \"Solaris,\" \"Stalker,\" and \"Andrei Rublev.\" Tarkovsky is considered one of the greatest film directors of all time, known for combining introspection, reflection on the human condition, and beautiful cinematography. \"Stalker\" has inspired the video game series S.T.A.L.K.E.R., which is based on the novel \"Roadside Picnic\" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. Despite the influence, there are differences between the book, the movie, and the game. The shooting locations used in \"Stalker\" can still be visited in Estonia. Tarkovsky's films are known for their Russian sentiment, which includes fatalism and melancholy. The subtitles on the Mosfilm YouTube channel might not always be accurate.No meaningful content to summarize.",

    "content": "\"Scar Tissues Make Relationships Wear Out\"04/26/2103. From a lecture by Professor John Ousterhout at Stanford, class CS142.This is my most touchy-feely thought for the weekend. Here\u2019s the basic idea: It\u2019s really hard to build relationships that last for a long time. If you haven\u2019t discovered this, you will discover this sooner or later. And it's hard both for personal relationships and for business relationships. And to me, it's pretty amazing that two people can stay married for 25 years without killing each other.[Laughter]But honestly, most professional relationships don't last anywhere near that long. The best bands always seem to break up after 2 or 3 years. And business partnerships fall apart, and there's all these problems in these relationships that just don't last. So, why is that? Well, in my view, it\u2019s relationships don't fail because there some single catastrophic event to destroy them, although often there is a single catastrophic event around the the end of the relationship, but that\u2019s typically a symptom rather than a cause. What typically happens is it accumulates in the little things that just build up over time, and I call those scar tissues. And the reason I use the phrase \"scar tissues\" is because scar tissue is when you have a wound that doesn't heal quite properly and you get this other tissue that just sort of fills the gap, which is called scar tissue, and that tissue is not as strong as the original tissue that was there. So, scar tissue is weak. So, what happens in relationships is that sooner or later, there's a conflict. It happens in all relationships and not all of them get resolved perfectly. So, now somebody's left feeling just a little bit unhappy about the result, mostly okay but just a little bit unhappy. But then it happens again... and it happens again in a different situation and no one of these is enough to kill the relationship, but over time that annoyance just builds up more and more and more and more, and then people start seeing patterns in behavior. You know if you ever hear the phrase \"You always X\": scar tissue.[Laughter]So people start becoming sensitive and then they expect the bad behavior and there's nothing more guaranteed to create bad behavior than expectation. You will find it if you see it. And so eventually it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse, and then somebody decides they just don't care anymore and typically that's the point where something spectacular happens and the relationship collapses. And people often think it was the spectacular thing that wrecked the relationship, but really it was all those little bits of scar tissue building up over months or years. And my opinion is that in most of these situations the people aren't fundamentally bad, though they often appear bad, typically at the spectacular end phase of the relationship. It's just that the relationship wore off. Just wore off: too much scar tissue.So, I'll give you an example of a relationship of mine that wore off. So, we had our house remodeled a couple years ago. Major remodeling of our kitchen and family room, and the foreman for the contractor, Jim, was in our house for every day for about 4 months during the work on the job. And it started off and things were fine, but then there were just little things that started happening. Like he wouldn't seal up the plastic around the kitchen, and so, dust would get in to the rest of the house. And most of the work he did was really great, but if he ever made a mistake he wouldn't want to admit it; he would kinda make excuses to try to avoid fixing his mistake, and this just got more and more annoying for me. And I'm sure I did my share in return because I'm sort of a perfectionist, and I probably noticed every little thing he did that wasn't absolutely perfect, and it probably drove him crazy that every morning when he came in, I was there standing in the kitchen ready to tell him about all the mistakes he made yesterday [Laughter], and so it just got worse and worse and worse to the point where we were barely on speaking terms at the end of the project, and one day our daughter came in, and she was like, \u201cDad I think your relationship with Jim is wearing out,\u201d [Laughter] which was when I realized I shouldn't be telling her my theories about relationships.[Big Laughter]Now, I could have sat down with Jim to try to work it out, but I decided since it was only a 4 month contracting job, I'll just put up with it, and you know, it'll be done in a while. He would have been pretty worried if we sat down and I was like, \u201cJim, can we talk [Laughter] about my feelings? I mean you left the plastic open and dust got into the house, and sometimes I feel like you don't respect me as a person.\u201d[Laughter]Now maybe if I tried that he would instantly change his behavior just to make sure we never, ever had to have a conversation again. [Laughter] So, the solution is if you want a relationship to last a long time, somehow you have to keep the scar tissue from building up. And that's really hard. So, when there's an issue, you somehow have to resolve it where there is zero lingering animosity. Nobody is even a little bit upset. Because even a little upset, that scar tissue that accumulates, that never goes away. And that's really hard to do; I don't have any perfect answers for that; it's communication and compromise. Both people need to be willing to listen to understand the other person's view and then you have to find some compromise where everybody agrees that's a fair trade off so nobody\u2019s upset. So, that's really hard, and if either person can't listen or can't compromise, the odds are not good long term for that relationship. But there are classic mistakes people make. Like, some people are just too nice, and they wreck the relationships. They think, \u201cOh, it's not a big deal, it's just one little thing, not worth having a big argument about it. I'll just give in.\u201d Well, that seems generous, but it's a really bad idea. You have to ask yourself, \"Are you really, completely, 100% over this? You're giving in? No animosity? You're not secretly hoping that maybe they'll do something for you in return or a little behavior change here or there?\"[Laughter]Because if there's anything at all when you're giving in that you can feel bad about later, you're nuking the relationship - you're creating scar tissue with yourself, and that will build up to the point where you wreck the relationship. And the flipside is also bad. You may think, \u201cI'm such a good arguer, I can just argue this person to death, and whatever they want I can just outargue them: I'll yell louder with more words, and I'll get my way. Whew! That was a great, great resolution, I got my way.\u201d Well, you're nuking the relationship, sorry. So, somehow both people have to be completely satisfied with the outcome. So, the irony of this is, I think it's not the big things that nuke relationships it's all those little things. Even if there's a big thing, the relationship was going to die really soon anyway. So, just think about your relationship experience and the people around you. How many of you have either had a relationship that wore out like this or you've seen somebody around you and you could see their relationship wearing out?[90% of a 300+ class raises their hands]Yeah, it happens to everybody and we've all been there. And the trick is, again, you just have to avoid the creation of scar tissue. Not easy, but it's the only solution. Okay, that's my thought for the weekend",

    "hn_content": "A post on Hacker News discusses the idea of preventing \"scar tissue\" in relationships by regularly sharing feelings and confronting problems head-on. This approach is known as Imago Dialogue and can lead to personal growth and more open communication. However, some people may find this type of communication style uncomfortable and may need to adjust their communication style to fit the relationship. It is essential to validate people and be curious, even if you do not agree with them. Being honest does not necessarily mean being unfiltered but tailoring messages to avoid misunderstandings. People claiming to be \"brutally honest\" are not usually consistent with their behavior because it can be used to self-justify brutality. The key is to advocate for yourself and communicate openly while helping others self-regulate. Ultimately, choosing a good partner is essential for a successful relationship.The comments section discusses a communication technique called non-violent communication, which involves expressing feelings and needs without attacking the other person. The importance of validating someone else's feelings and addressing issues early on is also highlighted. Some commenters share personal experiences of using this technique successfully in their relationships, while others express skepticism or concern about its effectiveness or potential misuse. The concept of scar tissue in relationships is also touched upon, with some suggesting that addressing smaller issues regularly can prevent larger issues from developing. Overall, the post provides insight into how communication can impact relationships and the importance of addressing issues proactively.The article discusses the metaphor of scar tissue for relationships and whether it accurately reflects the dynamics of long-lasting relationships. The commenters share their experiences and perspectives, suggesting that shared values, communication, commitment, and trust are all critical factors in relationship longevity. Additionally, the conversation touches on the challenges of accurately communicating one's thoughts and intentions to a partner and the importance of monitoring and correcting misunderstandings. Ultimately, the discussion highlights the complexity and individuality of relationships and the need for ongoing attention and effort to maintain healthy connections.HN users discuss relationships and how to handle conflict and differences in partners. They compare it to the concept of scar tissue and how it may build up over time, leading to fragility. It is essential to let some things go and focus on the right investments. Arranged marriages may work well due to a lack of expectation, and letting things go may lead to long-term relationship success. Some users suggest using AI, such as chatGPT, for more effective communication, but it is also crucial to consider underlying control issues and be non-judgmental in communication. Moreover, NVC can be helpful in resolving conflicts by being non-judgmental and focusing on emotional communication.The article is a discussion about the importance of open communication in relationships and the potential dangers of letting resentment build up. The author discusses his experience with a contractor and how their communication issues eventually led to the end of their working relationship. He also offers advice on how to approach difficult conversations and emphasizes the importance of empathy, compromise, and respect within relationships. The comments section includes anecdotes and additional perspectives on the subject.The article discusses the accumulation of small issues that lead to the break down of relationships. It suggests that embracing known limitations and forgiving others' mistakes is key to building long-term relationships. The author compares \"scar tissue\" to resentment and highlights the importance of positive interactions to build goodwill in relationships. There are references to other articles and comments that provide additional insights on the topic. No new or exciting technology is mentioned in this post.",

    "content": "A memo has been published containing reflections on events and reactions that transpired following the release of information about the NSA by Edward Snowden. The memo is intended to offer historical perspective, while providing some insight into what security and privacy challenges the technical community should consider. It presents four different perspectives: someone who was involved with sifting through the information to responsibly inform the public; a security area director of the IETF; a human rights expert; and a computer science and law expert. The authors discuss the impact or lack thereof of Snowden\u2019s revelations on both security and human rights, and put the situation into historical context. Bruce Schneier recounts his experience working with Glenn Greenwald to explore the documents, while finding the whole experience surreal.- The author reflects on his experiences with the Snowden documents and how it impacted his perspective on privacy and security.\n- The Snowden revelations sparked a reaction from the IETF and broader Internet technical community, leading to a significant volume of work focused on improving security and privacy.\n- This work aimed to decrease the amount of plaintext visible to network observers and reduce the number of long-term identifiers enabling unexpected identification or re-identification of devices or users.\n- The work is ongoing, but significant progress has been made, even though there has been push-back from those who prefer not to strengthen security, which is expected based on historical precedent.\n- There has been little change in government surveillance practices, with the NSA only canceling some programs and becoming more public about defense.\n- Personal relationships and conflicts between reporters and writers covering the documents complicated and at times hindered the coverage of the Snowden documents.1. The Internet engineering community has not done enough to counter the explosion of surveillance capitalism over the past decade.\n2. Intrusive data sharing for advertising purposes cannot be effectively mitigated through Internet protocols.\n3. The Internet technical community needs to place more emphasis on ethical behavior standards to protect security and privacy.\n4. Snowden's revelations did not revolutionize our approach to protecting human rights on the Internet.\n5. Governments historically used cryptography to protect their messages, but also sought to crack other countries' encryption.- Encryption was historically used by governments and a few individuals, with the World Wars leading to the development of mechanical encryption devices and machine-assisted cryptanalysis.\n- Conflict arose in the 1970s between individuals' desire for privacy and government desires to read traffic, resulting in the creation of strong cryptography and NSA tampering.\n- Major developments in the early 1990s, including PGP, TSD-3600, and SSL, were seen as threats by the NSA and FBI.\n- The spread of strong cryptography led to the NSA and other agencies targeting computers and software to access data.\n- The adoption of encryption standards has increased, but ransomware and operational errors persist, and intelligence agencies are not going away.A look-back discusses the importance of privacy protection in the world of cryptography. While some democratic countries are moving to restrict encryption, the IETF is committed to strong, ubiquitous encryption embedded in protocols. The IETF recognizes the need for cryptographic maintenance to account for changing technology and parameters and prepare for post-quantum algorithms. Attention must also be given to metadata and ensuring trusted parties do not become a target of attack. National restrictions and intelligence agencies won't disappear, so it's up to engineers to pick the right path while staying true to principles. A possible solution to increase cybersecurity is opportunistic security in MPLS networks and TLS encrypted client hello. However, the IETF cannot regulate code vendors and websites use.",
    "summary": "- The memo reflects on the impact of Edward Snowden's revelations about NSA's activities on security, privacy, and human rights.\n- The authors provide different perspectives on the situation while analyzing the historical context and the progress made in privacy and security.\n- The IETF and broader Internet technical community have been working towards improving security and privacy, with significant progress made, but there has been push-back from naysayers.",

Many express concerns about government overreach and the need for transparency, while others argue that a democracy will always reflect the will of the people, regardless of laws in place. Discussions cover topics such as the need for more direct democracy and the Swiss model; how government secrecy can be harmful; and even comparisons between corporate and government surveillance. Overall, the thread highlights the ongoing importance of discussions about privacy, transparency, and government power in the tech world.An article on Hacker News touches on how the political and intellectual elite rely on misleading narratives as the \"new normal.\" The writer reveals how some people take pleasure in repeating official lies despite knowing the truth. The idea is that most people have misplaced priorities when it comes to matters of global import, and the article encourages technologists to get a privacy professional certification and work with state and federal agencies to change things. The comments section turns to a discussion on geopolitical affairs, with the poster pointing out the need to be wary of hand-wavey narratives that reduce complex issues to easy talking points.The post discusses the narratives surrounding China's alleged concentration camps, which are likened to Guantanamo Bay. The writer claims that the narrative is originated by a few sources, including the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), which is funded by military contractors. They argue that mainstream media propagates a \"China bad\" narrative to generate views and clicks and claim that it creates extremist views. The post also touches on the topic of Russian interference in the US elections and the discussion surrounding it.\nKey Points:\n- Alleged concentration camps in China are likened to Guantanamo Bay.\n- The narrative originates from a few sources, including ASPI, which is funded by military contractors.\n- The mainstream media creates fear and anger to generate views and clicks with a \"China bad\" narrative; this creates extremist views.\n- The post touches on the topic of Russian interference in US elections and its discussion.Intelligence agencies possess immense power, can force compliance, and have access to a vast amount of information on citizens. The advancements in technology over the past few years have led to major breakthroughs in AI. However, this tech is leading to more surveillance, and the potential for a government-controlled AI that knows everything (related to privacy and personal information) is not far from reality. The leaks from Edward Snowden shed light on the massive amounts of data accessible to intelligence agencies, but the agencies primarily use endpoint security to access user data.

ChatGPT has limitations and its primary function is to generate plausible language, not factual statements. Large Language Models (LLMs) are designed to abstract knowledge and produce plausible language, not to provide accurate information. Users should understand its limitations and use it correctly. GPT-4 is more aligned with factual accuracy than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. AI must be carefully aligned to make it safe and aligned with human understanding.OpenAI's language models, such as Chat GPT, are being discussed in relation to a recent case in the US, where a lawyer relied on Chat GPT to generate misleading statements about a case. Concerns have been raised over the accuracy of such models and their marketing claims, leading some to call for more accountability and regulation for creators of these models. However, others argue that the models themselves cannot be held accountable and that the responsibility lies with the users. There is disagreement over whether Chat GPT's occasional output of incorrect information is lying or simply unintentional falsehoods. Some are also comparing Chat GPT's production of persuasive but false text to the rhetorical concept of \"bullshytt\" from the novel Anathem.This is a comment thread about ChatGPT generated by OpenAI. The conversation challenges the idea of ChatGPT being called AI and what it means for it to tell the truth or lie. Some argue that ChatGPT is only a text generator that produces sequences of words that sound good together and is not capable of knowing the truth or falsehood of its output. Others worry that creators of such tools should be held liable for the output while others suggest restricted access to the models to people who have taken a basic course on their use and behavior. The conversation also touches upon philosophical debates such as the definition of consciousness and intelligence.The post discusses how ChatGPT, an AI chatbot, was cited in a US legal case, despite being warned that its responses may be inaccurate. The bot has previously been shown to produce false information and is an unreliable source of truth. The conversation in the comments includes several discussions on what constitutes a lie and if the bot can technically lie. The issue highlights how computers are only reflecting reality and not reality itself. Despite the numerous warnings and disclaimers, people still assume the information to be correct. The larger discussion is about how AI-generated information should be treated and the need for standardized practices for handling such information.A lawyer's misguided use of ChatGPT highlights the potential limitations of large language models (LLMs), triggering debates over whether LLMs should be integrated into legal practices. While LLMs can automate several manual tasks, provide better access to information, help lawyers spot patterns, and generate creative solutions, they face several challenges, including the need for expensive and time-consuming training, the difficulty for computers to comprehend false nuances and complexities of legal language, and the possibility of generating unreliable or biased content in complex legal problems. Despite this, LLMs are likely to impact the legal profession and likely to become increasingly important. The use of LLMs raises questions about the responsibilities of companies like Microsoft and OpenAI in creating them and about the competency of lawyers who trust them too much.",

Ultimately, the web stack's usefulness depends on the needs of each user, and developers can choose how to approach their work accordingly.- Web development has become more complex with the rise of JS frameworks and ads/tracking.\n- Accessibility is improving with ML-assisted markup generation.\n- HTML/CSS have made great progress and should be embraced.\n- Performance loss in web apps is due to JS bloat, unnecessary frameworks, and unwanted tracking.\n- Web apps should only be used where necessary, not every website needs to be a \"web app\".\n- Standard and good usage of HTML/CSS should be prioritized, with less emphasis on heavy JS frameworks.\n- The web has enabled significant progress in the digital economy, including many transactions that drive the physical economy.\n- WASM enables developers to write code for browsers in any language they want.- Mozilla laid off the Servo team who were working on a better rendering engine for Firefox.\n- Parts of Servo were merged into Firefox to enable the use of GPU for compositing layers.\n- Servo could be used to build desktop webview type apps and with Sciter and Tauri, it has some features of native-app concepts.\n- Ads and all of the frameworks included are one of the reasons why web pages get bigger and slower.\n- There are some limitations with Servo, including lack of some of the DOM API.\n- The CPU/GPU/MPU/APU/xPU distinction will become less relevant as processors gain those capabilities.\n- Servo can provide a better performance, and in the future, ads running on the GPU could become unblockable.Servo, a parallel browser engine, is working on improving its Layout 2020 to support flexbox, grids, and a reliable float implementation. However, as of now, it's not ready for projects needing these features. Servo project can be accessed through Github but lacks a clear overview page and prominent link to documentation. Compositing different bitmaps and parallelization of layout are some topics discussed by community members. Servo was essential to the early development of Rust, and Rust chose runtime over compile-time for optimization. Incremental compilation and Rust's borrow-checking mechanism are significant factors in slowing down the compiler's speed. CSS Containment can optimize factoring, and layout, and alternatively, pre-layout of HTML can determine X, Ys and widths for different browser viewport sizes, which can speed up the layout process.- Developers discuss challenges to optimizing performance in development versus production environments\n- Rust's slow compile times may be due to prioritizing functionality over performance optimization during development\n- Commentators discuss the idea of a group of developers contributing a single line of code to create a new internet stack/browser/protocol project, with some arguing it would result in an unmaintainable mess\n- The success of Mozilla's Servo project in speeding up Firefox's rendering engine is attributed to the use of Rust instead of C, which allowed for better utilization of multiple CPU cores\n- The debate over whether Firefox is consistently slower than other browsers continues, with some arguing that it is highly workload dependent",
    "hn_summary": "- Rust and Servo are closely related, with Rust being developed alongside Servo and using Servo as its application.\n- There are alternatives to the current web stack, such as Svelte, Astro, and Gemini, that offer lightweight and low-power solutions.\n- Servo was essential to the early development of Rust, and it is working on improving its Layout 2020 to support flexbox, grids, and a reliable float implementation."
