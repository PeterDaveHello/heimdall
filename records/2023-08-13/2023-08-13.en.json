    "originBody": "Atoms vs Bits HOME CONTACT SUBSCRIBE BY URI IN SOCIAL — JUL 5, 2023 Carrot Problems In World War II, the story goes, the British invented a new kind of onboard radar that allowed its pilots to shoot down German planes at night.[1] They didn't want the Germans to know about this technology, but they had to give an explanation for their new, improbable powers. So they invented a propaganda campaign that claimed their pilots had developed exceptional eyesight by eating \"an excess of carrots.\" If you're going to trick people into doing something pointless, eating excessive carrots seems like one of the better ones. Still, there's an issue: people who believed the propaganda and tried to get super-sight would be spending time and effort on something that couldn't possibly solve their issue.[2] I'll call this a Carrot Problem. Once you look for Carrot Problems, you see them everywhere. Essentially, any time someone achieves success in a way they don't want to admit publicly, they have to come up with an excuse for their abilities. And that means misleading a bunch of people into (potentially) wasting their time, or worse. For example: People who take steroids don't generally admit to taking steroids, so they come up with various explanations for their new physiques. But anyone who follows that advice will be disappointed; without the steroids, they just won't get the same results. Many companies basically distribute their jobs to friends and insiders, but don't want to admit that publicly. So they set up public application processes, which cause outsiders to waste time and effort applying through a channel that has 0 chance of landing them the job. Various companies make a lot of money by implementing \"dark patterns\", such as getting customers onto subscriptions and then making it hard for them to cancel. They can't admit that this is why their revenue went up, so they make a bunch of claims about how their success comes out of [various beneficent strategies], but anyone who tries to replicate the success by using those lovely strategies is liable to go broke. It's impossible to know the scale of Carrot Problems in business: it's possible that every successful business got there by doing something ugly, but you'll never know that by reading public statements. Most business biographies become useless once you realise that they're Carrot Problemmed. For this reason, Carrot Problems greatly increase the value of being an \"insider\". There's some fields where it really might be true that you can learn everything you need to know by reading books at the public library. But anytime people are succeeding for reasons they won't admit in public, it's hard to get a grasp on the situation unless you have private back-channels. I've personally seen the damage that certain narratives cause to outsiders who believe that you can succeed by doing [X/Y/Z], because famous VC/startup influencers kept saying so, and they believed it. Of course, once you know that your supposed-role-models are doing [some bad thing] to succeed, that doesn't mean you will do it too. Ideally you find some other way to succeed in the same field without doing bad things; if not, you might just decide that this particular game isn't one you want to play. But the privilege of being an insider is that you won't waste your time trying to succeed using a strategy that doesn't actually work, while some poor kid is eating carrots all day in the hopeless hope that it will fix her eyesight. amusingly the new system was called \"AI\", hence sentences like \"RAF night fighter ace John Cunningham ... was the first to shoot down an enemy plane using AI\" ↩︎ obviously in the narrow case that the people whose time was wasted were German WWII pilots this was actually bonus-good, but in the general case it's bad to waste people's time and effort. ↩︎ PREVIOUS ISSUE Unfairly Angry NEXT ISSUE New Book: Book Subscribe to Atoms vs Bits Receive our weekly posts by email jamie@example.com SUBSCRIBE Atoms vs Bits © 2023 Powered by Ghost",

So much opportunity is either created or destroyed by external circumstances that we don&#x27;t perceive, let alone control. Since we all subconsciously write our own creation myths, it&#x27;s not easy to discover and attribute forces that we aren&#x27;t aware of when looking back on our life paths. The perennial bullshit self-explanation is hard work. How hard they work is one thing that they can control, and they know they worked hard, so they assume it had more of an effect than it did... and in turn, others that worked less hard didn&#x27;t succeed. For example, they might assume that their uncle was willing to set up that meeting with their first big client because they worked hard enough to be worthy of it, rather than realizing that others who worked as hard or harder lacked a connected uncle. reply bruce511 12 hours agoparentVery few business success stories credit luck with being a root cause.But in real life luck (or \"chance\" , if you prefer) plays a part, sometimes a significant part.It was lucky that John and Paul went to school together. It was lucky they got on together and became good friends. Thanks to that luck ee got the Beatles.Of course it (usually) takes -more- than just luck, but dig deep enough and its there. reply bostik 3 hours agorootparent> But in real life luck (or \"chance\" , if you prefer) plays a part, sometimes a significant part.This reminds me of a story I heard nearly 20 years ago. (Told by a UCLA staff member.)In the early 2000&#x27;s, a UCLA professor invited a successful entrepreneur to give a guest lecture on one of their business courses. During the lecture he was asked what made him the success and the fortune - and the answer was distilled to less than seven words: \"Get lucky. Then stack the deck.\" He went on to explain that the best way to maintain a competitive edge was to make it as hard as possible for anyone else to try to follow his steps or to circumvent his position. But first you had to get lucky enough to afford it.He was not invited again. Too honest and demoralising for the students. reply thumbuddy 19 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s hilarious and absolutely true. I think he omitted a few shadier things too. reply beebeepka 20 minutes agorootparentprevMaybe the professor didn&#x27;t like the \"sabotage competition\" part. I know I didn&#x27;t.I do believe luck&#x2F;chance is the most important ingredient. reply simonh 10 hours agorootparentprevThe tricky side of that is how to distinguish between luck and opportunity. Loads of people might be friends at school with someone with a great complementary talent, or have a connected uncle, or happen to start a business in a sector that about to really take off. They may even think about the opportunity and how to take advantage of it, but for whatever reason they don’t.So there are multiple factors. Some initial lucky opportunity, the insight to spot it, the willingness to take a risk on it, and hard work to see it through. reply edmundsauto 9 hours agorootparentFrequency and quality of opportunity is also a luck factor. reply plasticsoprano 9 hours agorootparentprevSomeone doesn’t listen to How I Built This. One of Guy’s questions at the end of each interview is what percentage of their success was luck and pretty much all of them from Michael Dell to Drew Houston and everyone in between put luck at a far greater percentage than any other attribute. reply WalterBright 9 hours agorootparentprevI recommend reading a biography of the Beatles. Don&#x27;t overlook the many years they spent playing dive bars day and night, honing their skills as a band.Brian Epstein, a nobody, recognized opportunity when he met the Beatles. reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentThe Beatles kind of sucked at the beginning of their career. That they became as good as they did was a shot in the dark— not the ability to divide which ones would become great. The are so many incredibly talented musicians in the world— if anybody could consistently choose the winners, record company finances would be way different. Of the bands that get signed to record labels, the percentage that become the \"it\" acts is microscopic. reply CPLX 15 minutes agorootparentPeople always say this about the Beatles but it’s fucking ridiculous. I’m a musician and have spent a lot of my life around musicians including very very famous ones and including ones who are very famous now but were not when I met them.I’ve also met hundreds of musicians who practice and try for years and are basically the same at the end as when they start.The difference between being OK and quite good indeed can be bridged with practice.The difference between being a quite good and polished songwriter and being Paul McCartney involves being fucking born Paul McCartney.Also “they sucked at the beginning bf their career?” What in the the fuck are you talking about? They had a hit with Love Me Do when their ages ranged from 20-23 years old. That’s not fast enough for you?Paul Simon had his first hit single as a teenager. Robert Plant was 19 when he recorded Zeppelin I.No amount of practice alone is going to to get you to that level of talent.Anyone implying otherwise 1) is trying to sell you books and 2) has spent zero actual time as a musician and around musicians and songwriters. reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparentprev> The are so many incredibly talented musicians in the worldIf there are so many, then they aren&#x27;t incredible.It takes a lot more than talent to be successful in music. More than musical talent, too. One has to also be able to create catchy tunes, play them, fit in with your band, pick the right look for the band, the right name, packaging, etc. etc. etc. I recommend reading up on what Brian Epstein did for them.The songs of the Beatles (and Michael Jackson) are consistently better than the songs of their contemporaries.> the percentage that become the \"it\" acts is microscopicAre the 99% simply not that good? I enjoy music from all kinds of bands, but the quantity and consistent high quality of the Beatles&#x27; and Jackson&#x27;s work are standouts. reply duped 11 hours agoparentprevThe carrot problem in TFA describes when there is an incentive to lie - what you&#x27;re describing is something else entirely. It&#x27;s not usually in the interest of someone with wealth to lie about how they got there.There&#x27;s a big difference between being wrong&#x2F;full of shit and outright lying because to tell the truth would harm your ability to make money. The former is just being an idiot, the latter is being a market manipulator&#x2F;con &#x2F;artist&#x2F;grifter&#x2F;etc. reply WalterBright 9 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not about working hard. It&#x27;s about working smart.> So much opportunity is either created or destroyed by external circumstances that we don&#x27;t perceive, let alone controlHowever, doing nothing guarantees failure. Some aspects of working smart:1. doing the prep work so when opportunity does come your way, you are capable of taking advantage2. placing yourself in a situation where opportunity can find you3. learning to recognize opportunity (it often comes disguised as hard work)4. be willing to take risks reply interroboink 8 hours agorootparent(apologies for the small tangential rant; it&#x27;s a topic I care about :)I have seen this view towards luck a few times — some variant of \"make your own luck\" or \"put yourself in situations where you&#x27;re more likely to be lucky\", and similar.I don&#x27;t object to it by itself, but there&#x27;s a subtlety that is often missed: it only applies to yourself, not other people. Or perhaps more accurately: it only applies to your choice of action, not evaluating others&#x27; results.The reason I have misgivings is because I have seen it used as a cudgel; someone fails, and a person with this mindset is more prone to rationalize it, saying \"oh, they didn&#x27;t try hard enough\" or \"it was their own fault, they should be smarter about it.\"No.No matter how hard a person tries, they can still fail, and it may not be their fault at all. At least when it&#x27;s your own self, you have more information to know if you could have done better. When it&#x27;s directed at others, it&#x27;s extremely dicey to make those judgements.Someone more in tune with the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune might be more inclined to actually help that person, rather than blaming them for things outside of their control.It&#x27;s tricky, because the \"try harder next time\" whip is useful, to be sure, but it also can be an enemy of empathy. reply WalterBright 8 hours agorootparent> they can still failOf course. I never wrote otherwise.Many successful people I know failed multiple times.> \"it was their own fault, they should be smarter about it.\"The successful people I know who failed multiple times and eventually succeeded all blamed themselves for the failures, with \"I should have been smarter about it\".The great thing about taking responsibility for one&#x27;s failures is it is empowering - it means you can succeed by learning why one failed and doing it better next time.You could consider it like airliners. Crashes are not attributed to \"bad luck\". The cause is always searched for, and once found, it gets fixed. Over time, this has resulted in incredibly safe airliners.Do you really expect to successfully ride a bike the first time you swing your leg over the seat? Nope. You fall off, get back on, fall off, get back on, fall off, get back on, hey! I&#x27;m riding! reply seabass-labrax 6 hours agorootparentI learnt to ride with extra wheels attached to the side of the bicycle, and as a result, I almost never fell during that learning process.Translating the analogy back, what you describe is the entrepreneurial fail-until-you-win method. The alternative method of progression is that of apprenticeship or gradual promotion, which in my country is associated with traditionally middle-class professions like finance, medicine and law. In such a conventional career, success is almost guaranteed, as the number of people entering the profession is very close to the number retiring out of it, and the assumption is that, because the endeavour has always been profitable, it will be for you too.Ideally, the profession as a whole gradually improves under this system, but no individual member of it has to engage in any more than an average level of risk to be personally successful. reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparentYeah, well, such safe avenues don&#x27;t lead to making a billion. reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentAnd unsafe avenues aren&#x27;t an option for the majority of people in the US. reply WalterBright 3 hours agorootparentNot buying that. America is not a nation of poor people. reply daverol 1 hour agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Poverty_in_the_United_States replypaulryanrogers 6 hours agorootparentprevThis assumes one can afford multiple failures. Being born rich buys you a lot of swings of the bat. Otherwise you can&#x27;t swing big, and opportunities to connect will be fewer--if any.Rich kids can afford &#x27;responsibility&#x27; because they have money to pay for their mistakes. Poor kids don&#x27;t.Best way to be prepared for success? Be born to a rich and well connected family. reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparentBasically none of the rich people I know came from more than middle class parents. A couple came to America with nothing but a suitcase. reply CMCDragonkai 5 hours agorootparentprevHow did their parents get rich? Was it because the grandparents was rich? reply interroboink 5 hours agorootparentI think in many cases when you trace it back, it comes down to ... luck (:Which is funny, since now the descendants of some lucky people get the opportunity to take lots of chances and say \"look how hard work pays off — I made my own luck!\"Though that&#x27;s a pretty simplistic take; I feel like hard work really does pay off, broadly speaking, but also luck plays a (much) bigger role than most give it credit. reply WalterBright 4 hours agorootparentLuck will never find the person living in his mom&#x27;s basement playing video games and griping about inequity. reply wizofaus 4 hours agorootparentGiven the number of possible alternative realities they could have been born into it, I&#x27;d strongly suggest luck has already found such people. It&#x27;s even possible had they not been born into such an easy existence they might have ultimately done better for themselves (\"possible\", not likely). reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentprevThat you cite this as the alternative shows the limits of your perspective. reply chefandy 5 hours agorootparentprev\"Entrepreneurs come from families with money\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;07&#x2F;17&#x2F;entrepreneurs-family-money&#x2F; reply oefnak 7 hours agorootparentprevWhat if you&#x27;re born in a poor country? Just keep trying? reply WalterBright 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sorry for people who are born in communist&#x2F;socialist countries. My statements apply to the US. For those in democratic socialist countries, stop voting for socialism. reply ahf8Aithaex7Nai 4 hours agorootparentYour worldview is amusing. Everything is simple and consistent. Simple concepts, simple explanations, simple recipes. You have to be a complete idiot or very lazy not to succeed in the world as you see it. reply WalterBright 2 hours agorootparentIf you&#x27;re convinced you can&#x27;t succeed in America, you certainly won&#x27;t. reply ahf8Aithaex7Nai 2 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t play the lottery, you can&#x27;t win. That&#x27;s obvious. But the vast majority of people in America will not succeed even if they are convinced that success is possible. reply chefandy 4 hours agorootparentprevWhere you are born is a matter of luck, and not just in governance. You can directly correlate success in the US to the zip code you were born into.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;19&#x2F;learning&#x2F;how-much-has-you... reply WalterBright 2 hours agorootparentFortunately, you can move to whatever zip code you like. reply wizofaus 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat examples of \"democratic socialist\" countries do you have in mind that would be likely to achieve significantly greater economic wealth&#x2F;material standard of living just by voting differently? reply WalterBright 3 hours agorootparentBritain, for example. For others, there are the former Soviet bloc countries. The ones that voted for more free markets have done significantly better than the ones that clung to socialism. Chile is another one that prospers and declines based on them vacillating between socialism and free markets. reply wizofaus 3 hours agorootparentPretty sure Britain&#x27;s economic woes have not been tied to an excess of socialism on account of its governments, at least in the last few decades. At any rate, both the UK and USA (and arguably most other modern wealthy countries) are essentially social democracies - it&#x27;s largely a matter of degree (and to what extent it&#x27;s prevalent at a federal vs state vs local level). But from the perspective of an Australian, the economy of the USA looks for all the world like one I want to avoid ours becoming at all costs. To be clear, I&#x27;m very much envious of the opportunities US-based technology workers have, and if there were a way to achieve that level of entrepreneurship and sheer variety of industrial success stories here while still maintaining a cohesive society not beset by destabilizing levels of inequality* I&#x27;d be all for it.(*) on the inequality front, perhaps what puts me off the most is seeing the degree to which relatively few mega-corporations appear to dominate much of the social fabric. Which is a problem in Australia too but to a lesser extreme. reply WalterBright 2 hours agorootparentIf you vote for less inequality, be prepared for a lower standard of living. No country has ever managed to raise the standard of living of its citizens by preventing people from getting rich and&#x2F;or confiscating their wealth and&#x2F;or murdering them (see Pol Pot). reply wizofaus 2 hours agorootparentI never said anything about preventing people getting rich. But a slightly lower material standard of living on average seems a reasonable price to pay for avoiding the least desirable outcomes from excessive inequality. reply abenga 2 hours agorootparentprevHaven&#x27;t the Tories been in power for more than a decade? replyinterroboink 5 hours agorootparentprev> they can still fail>> Of course. I never wrote otherwise.I did not mean to imply that you did (:You touched on a general topic, and I was speaking to that, more than your specific words.> successful people ... blamed themselves for the failuresI&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true. But I&#x27;m trying to draw a thin, wiggly line between awareness of room for improvement (usually more on a rational level), and blame&#x2F;judgement (usually more on an emotional level). The former is great, the latter not so much.I&#x27;d wager that there are also a whole lot of un-successful people who blamed themselves for their failures, even if they could do no better. People who hate themselves. People who are unhappy. My commentary is more directed at those people and those who would care about them, than the ones you mention.> taking responsibility ... you can succeed by learningThis definitely straddles the wiggly line (: One one side is \"taking responsibility,\" and on the other is \"it&#x27;s your fault.\"Certainly one should internalize the lesson. But hopefully not the shame&#x2F;blame. Perhaps neither you nor your successful acquaintences suffer from this affliction, but in my experience many do.I realize that some people are lazy and looking for excuses to escape responsibility, so perhaps you see my viewpoint as somehow enabling or encouraging that bad behavior. I just want to point out that there are downsides in the other direction too, if taken to puritanical extremes. And I daresay the \"being lazy is bad\" side of the argument gets a whole lot more headspace in our culture than the \"it&#x27;s okay, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with you\" side. Hence my attempt to bring some balance.> You could consider it like airliners ...> ride a bike the first time ...The thing about airlines is that they operate in a very carefully crafted environment. Planes stay away from each other, are generally aware of each other (notwithstanding that friggin&#x27; biplane without a radio that cut me off on downwind... grr), have high maintenance standards, etc. etc. Real life can be much more dense&#x2F;messy&#x2F;fast-moving&#x2F;full of unknowns, I find. You do not always get the luxury of knowing the variables involved.But the problem with both of your examples is that they assume you can learn and try again. And that&#x27;s not always the case.What if you&#x27;re a passenger on one of those airliners that crashes? What should you have done better, personally?Born in a poor country? Sorry, no re-try.Born with a damaged brain or body? Sorry, no re-try.Have abusive parents? Maybe a few can pull themselves out (probably mostly by luck or the help of others), but it will have lifelong effects.You get the idea. And those examples are extreme; there are myriad other \"softer\" struggles people have, with varying levels of control. Depression comes to mind.So, in conclusion, my whole long-winded reply is just trying to say: sometimes people (like you) express the \"you have nobody to blame but yourself\" attitude, with good intentions, directed at the sort of enabled people you were talking about, but it gets applied to other people, with heart-wrenching effects. reply WalterBright 5 hours agorootparent> The thing about airlines is that they operate in a very carefully crafted environment.They do now, as the consequence of many crashes.> And that&#x27;s not always the caseI liken this as \"humans have two legs\" and the riposte is \"not all humans have two legs\". Notice the requirement to insert a missing word, \"all\". I hope you&#x27;ll forgive me, because I am rather testy about this sort of waste of time. If I mean \"always\" or \"all\" or \"100%\" I would use those qualifiers. Those qualifiers exist for a reason.> Born with a damaged brain or body?Oh criminy. I shouldn&#x27;t have to add that if you&#x27;re mentally deranged none of this applies. In fact, I believe I even wrote somewhere here \"of sound mind and body\" because I know somebody would pipe up with \"not everybody likes ice cream\". reply interroboink 3 hours agorootparentI think I am talking past you in some way; sorry about that.I am not trying to play word games or pull \"gotchas\" on your phrasing. I think I have a straightforward underlying message; I hope you can hear it through my imprecise miasma of words.Maybe you already heard it, but are only replying to the remaining small tidbits you object to; I&#x27;m unsure.In truth, I have a similar frustration, where I feel the fragmentary quotations of mine you reply to do not give justice to the larger context in which they were written. But I don&#x27;t hold it against you; I know that struggle.Anyway, one more attempt:You presented some simple advice (\"It&#x27;s not about working hard. It&#x27;s about working smart.\"), and as mentioned I don&#x27;t disagree with it per se.But in my life, I have seen that advice used \"for evil\", if you will. (I do not mean to imply that you intend it that way, of course).And in particular, I do find that people giving and following that advice are often either willfully or ignorantly (more often the latter) blind to the downsides that can go along with it — vis-a-vis empathy towards others, for instance. Of course, I do not mean to imply that you are blind to it. I don&#x27;t know you.So, I hoped to give some voice to that other perspective, is all. I find it to be under-represented, in discussions like these. Hugely so.----Re: humans having two legs: I truly am not sure if you are messing with me, or if I really failed to deliver my idea so totally. I swear I don&#x27;t mind if it&#x27;s the former, though I feel it is the latter (: Help me improve my communications protocol?I thought our sequence went something like this:you: work hard and learn from your mistakesme: agreed. but also, beware of assigning blame for misfortuneyou: here are some examples of how learning from mistakes is useful&#x2F;empowering [airliners, bikes]me: yes, and here are some examples of misfortune that&#x27;s not blame-worthy [unlucky birth, etc.]you: my examples were not meant to be all-encompassing [humans have two legs]me: ???Actually, writing it out maybe makes it more clear.

He&#x27;ll in fact describe how to do this in order to generate publicity, or as a mechanism to expose hypocrisy or bad logic. But when he&#x27;s in the middle of it he&#x27;ll commit to the bit.Basically, someone says X, which is crazy, because if X then logically Y would be true and Y is not only wrong but offensive. So he&#x27;ll publicly assert Y and get people to argue with him, but the only real way to show that Y is wrong is to admit that X is wrong, which was the point.And then the people arguing with him don&#x27;t want to do that. They want to be offended by Y without admitting that X is wrong. So he has a bunch of fun with them because they&#x27;ve foreclosed themselves at the outset from winning the debate on the merits. reply lazyasciiart 12 hours agorootparentThe thing to understand about this argument is that it is unfalsifiable nonsense.

The point isn&#x27;t that Y is right, it&#x27;s that X and Y are both wrong but you can&#x27;t admit to that if you&#x27;re a hypocrite.And the \"anything he says that is wrong is him joking\" is the idea, because it works both ways. If someone says something which is actually wrong, you can make a convincing argument for why if you&#x27;re willing to be logically consistent yourself.But there are also things which are politically offensive yet true, and having a reputation for this kind of trolling is what allows someone to say those things out loud. Because then you make the same claim: \"Maybe I&#x27;m trolling you, if I am just provide the counterargument.\"Which you can&#x27;t do if the counterargument requires you to admit that X is wrong and you refuse to do that, but you also can&#x27;t do if there is no counterargument because Y is true.It doesn&#x27;t matter whether \"is he trolling this time\" is falsifiable.

It was Rassmussen and also a pollster stirring up trouble so realistically he should have just dismissed it as a likely lie by not-reporting-the-real-context of the question being asked (I personally suspect dodgy framing).

Whether the poll is accurate isn&#x27;t even the point -- and purposely choosing a poll with an artificially large number could be part of the troll.X is the belief \"it&#x27;s not okay to be white.\" Which presumably doesn&#x27;t actually have a 47% prevalence, but it&#x27;s also not zero. What he&#x27;s implying is that if a large proportion of black people actually believed this, his statement would be a completely plausible response from a significant proportion of white people.

It predisposes you to success if you seek it - and both those people spent an enormous amount of their youth working to get there.The point is that success is not determined before you&#x27;re born, and reasonable people understand that there&#x27;s such a thing as variance in human anatomy. reply achenet 15 hours agoparentprevI think there&#x27;s a lot of truth to the quote \"hard work beats talent when talent doesn&#x27;t work hard\".For top .0001% success in some fields (most sports, for example), you need genetic qualities AND hard work. reply parentheses 17 hours agoprevI think this is a good mental model to employ, but also has the potential to poison positivity.Hard work and perseverance can (and IME often does) lead to success. There&#x27;s this attractive narrative that any outlier success is entirely built from seedy&#x2F;unethical&#x2F;immoral&#x2F;corrupt acts. This narrative helps to justify and excuse mediocrity. Instead, we should be asking the hard questions which may encourage harder&#x2F;smarter work and perseverance. reply makeitdouble 1 hour agoparentIf hard work and perseverance are your North Star, I kinda assume listening to VCs and famous people&#x27;s success stories won&#x27;t bring you much in the first place. reply Rexxar 17 hours agoparentprevI would say that hard work and perseverance are always necessary at some point but not always sufficient for success. reply winwang 13 hours agorootparentI find that people place too much emphasis on \"hard\" work and not the \"right\" work. Personally, I know too many people who have worked their butts off... on the wrong problems.It&#x27;s quite simple to continue sweating on the same path, if not easy. But it feels like people prefer difficulty to complexity.Of course, even working hard on the right problems carries no guarantee. Yet, life isn&#x27;t about guarantees, but about rigging the dice in your favor. reply ilyt 12 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty much \"if your success depends on luck you still have to show up and start rolling the dice\" reply isaacremuant 17 hours agoparentprevIt depends on the type of success you are after.Doing well and creating great stuff can be due to hard work but raising to certain positions of power definitely requires gaming the system in ways that can be seen as anti ethical or at least counter to the alleged ethos of the company, group, etc.People in different hierarchies end up optimizing for their careers and detract from any Analysis that will conclude otherwise, putting themselves in positions where they have always someone to deflect to and focus on personal branding over real results because, in the end, it&#x27;s what allow them to also have real results some times.It&#x27;s an \"end justifies the means\" and \"it&#x27;s the name of the game\".It becomes more and more buteocratic, political and networkey the higher you climb&#x2F;interact.Those will be very interested in talking abour merit ( pretending others are \"mediocre\") and fairness while playing under different rules reply parentheses 13 hours agorootparentI agree with you - not all success can be achieved only through hard work.I feel that our (societal) culture is all about bringing down those who achieve success by vilifying them for specific actions. My purpose of my post was purely to shed light that carrot problems are not as common as one may think and that they are only part of the story.Said another way, the article is right that what is said about success and how it was achieved is often a marketing oriented autobiography. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that the lies and embellishments conceal insidious actions. reply derefr 15 hours agoprevThis is one reason the field of behavioral economics is important to society: there are things that an individual or company would never publicly admit to doing — but which they&#x27;re fine to admitting under NDA, to be used as a datapoint in an anonymized dataset used in academic research.So, while no individual company will tell you that everyone&#x27;s using dark patterns or hiring their friends, behavioral economists can put forth evidence-backed arguments that this is the case — and so save you the trouble of bothering to chase the Carrot. reply hammock 14 hours agoparentThere is a great quote I read here about how your life changes once you are read into valuable info that no one else has. It was Daniel Ellsberg giving advice to Henry Kissinger when he first got his security clearances:>You will feel like a fool for having studied, written, talked about these subjects, criticized and analyzed decisions made by presidents for years without having known of the existence of all this information, which presidents and others had and you didn’t, and which must have influenced their decisions in ways you couldn’t even guess. In particular, you’ll feel foolish for having literally rubbed shoulders for over a decade with some officials and consultants who did have access to all this information you didn’t know about and didn’t know they had, and you’ll be stunned that they kept that secret from you so well.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36364718 reply esafak 13 hours agorootparentSee also Bruce Schneier&#x27;s essay on the same subject, discussed just yesterday: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37091989 reply opportune 13 hours agoprevI don’t think you can ever really learn from what a person says helped them do X. You have to look at the person themselves and try to figure out what about them made X happen - people have too much of a blind spot comparing themselves to the world outside their bubble, or understanding how other people perceive them. They lack the perspective to really know what about them is differentFor example most successful founders and CEOs in my experience may say taking meeting notes or setting a high bar helps. But really what helped is that they had personality traits leading to these behaviors which are what truly drove the benefits - they are meticulous and detail oriented so they want to use writing to nail down ideas, they set high standards for themselves and others so they do whatever it takes to avoid a bad hire or lazy decision. It would be considered impolite for the CEO to say that about themselves, and maybe they don’t even notice how much of an outlier they are in those traits, so instead you get told the effect rather than the cause of their success. Someone without those traits trying to ape out the processes won’t be able to realize the benefits.Similarly I think to a degree the whole “be connected or privileged from birth” is meant to be taken implicitly rather than ignored altogether, sometimes. Nobody wants to launch into a discussion about social class or inequality in some PR puff piece that’s like “oh mr startup ceo why are you so rich and successful”. Like in tennis nobody is going to say the secret to success is to have tiger parents and access to facilities and training from a young age that 99% of people can’t afford. When people say “leverage your connections” they’re kind of saying Joe Average without connections is out of the game until they build those connections, but politely. reply DanHulton 16 hours agoprevThis is a great way to describe all those \"buy my book to learn how to make money online!\" scams.

You have to keep things close to the chest and limit access, or else you&#x27;ll spend all your time sifting through the noise. For example, the best way to reach me is by phone.

It&#x27;s not even necessarily that people want to withhold that knowledge to reduce competition, but simply the effort of writing it all up properly is not worth it. The same time could be spent working on something that results in a prestigious publication. Of course sometimes people will altruistically draft up such things in blog posts. But then again, anything people write passes through their own internal filter of \"will this make me look good?\" so ultimately, you can only see the real tips by closely working with and watching with successful people.For example many of these people may work ridiculous hours and sacrifice on their personal relations.

    "originLink": "https://seiya.me/blog/reading-linux-v0.01",
    "originBody": "seiya.me / blog Feed Exploring the internals of Linux v0.01 August 12, 2023 Linux kernel is often mentioned as a overwhelmingly large open source software. As of this writing, the latest version is v6.5-rc5, which consists of 36M lines of code. Needless to say, Linux is a fruit of hard work of many contributors over the decades. However, the first version of Linux, v0.01 was pretty small. It consisted of only 10,239 lines of code. Excluding comments and blank lines, it was only 8,670 lines. It's small enough to understand and is a good starting point to learn about the internals of UNIX-like operating system kernels. Reading v0.01 was really fun for me. It was like visiting Computer History Museum in Mountain View - finally I witnessed tales are indeed true! I wrote this post to share this exciting experience with you. Let's dive in! Disclaimer: Obviously I'm not the author of Linux v0.01. If you find any mistakes in this post, please let me know! How do system calls look like? v0.01 has 66 system calls. Here's the list of them: access acct alarm break brk chdir chmod chown chroot close creat dup dup2 execve exit fcntl fork fstat ftime getegid geteuid getgid getpgrp setsid getpid getppid getuid gtty ioctl kill link lock lseek mkdir mknod mount mpx nice open pause phys pipe prof ptrace read rename rmdir setgid setpgid setuid setup signal stat stime stty sync time times ulimit umask umount uname unlink ustat utime waitpid write It supports reading, writing, creating, and deleting files and directories. Also, other fundamental concepts like chmod(2) (permission), chown(2) (owner), and pipe(2) (inter-process communication) are also supported. fork(2) and execve(2) were there. Only a.out executable format was supported. The concept of sockets was not implemented. Thus, no network support. Some features like mount(2) were not implemented. They just return ENOSYS: int sys_mount() {return -ENOSYS; } Deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 architecture There is a very famous debate Linus had with Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the author of MINIX, about the design of operating systems: monolithic vs. microkernel, which is better design? Tanenbaum pointed out that Linux is (or was) not portable because it was deeply hardcoded for Intel 386 (i386): MINIX was designed to be reasonably portable, and has been ported from the Intel line to the 680x0 (Atari, Amiga, Macintosh), SPARC, and NS32016. LINUX is tied fairly closely to the 80x86. Not the way to go. It's indeed true. Linux v0.01 was deeply hardcoded for i386. Here's the implementation of strcpy in include/string.h: extern inline char * strcpy(char * dest,const char *src) { __asm__(\"cld\\n\"\"1:\\tlodsb\\n\\t\"\"stosb\\n\\t\"\"testb %%al,%%al\\n\\t\"\"jne 1b\"::\"S\" (src),\"D\" (dest):\"si\",\"di\",\"ax\"); return dest; } It's written in assembly with string instructions of i386. Yes it can be found as an optimized implementation of strcpy in today's Linux, but it's in include/string.h - not in somewhere like include/i386/string.h. Moreover, no #ifdef to switch the implementation for different architectures. It's just hardcoded for Intel 386. Also, only PC/AT devices were supported: CMOS: Real-time clock (init/main.c). Programmable Interval Timer (PIT): Timer (kernel/sched.c). ATA (PIO): Hard disk (kernel/hd.c). VGA (text mode): Display (kernel/console.c). Intel 8042: PS/2 Keyboard (kernel/keyboard.s). Yes it's completely written in assembly! As you may noticed, they're not in drivers directory as in today's Linux. They're hardcoded in core subsystems. \"FREAX\" I've read in somewhere that Linus originally named his kernel \"FREAX\". Makefile in Linux v0.01 still had the following comment: # Makefile for the FREAX-kernel. It was indeed FREAX! What's the file system supported in v0.01? Today, Linux supports a variety of file systems such as ext4, Btrfs, and XFS. What about v0.01? ext2? Nope, here's a hint from include/linux/fs.h: #define SUPER_MAGIC 0x137F The answer is, as GPT-4 correctly guessed, MINIX file system! Fun fact: ext (\"extended file system\"), the predecessor of ext2/ext3/ext4, is inspired by MINIX file system. There \"probably\" won't be any reason to change the scheduler Here's the scheduler of Linux v0.01:while (1) { c = -1; next = 0; i = NR_TASKS; p = &task[NR_TASKS]; while (--i) {if (!*--p) continue;if ((*p)->state == TASK_RUNNING && (*p)->counter > c) c = (*p)->counter, next = i; } if (c) break; for(p = &LAST_TASK ; p > &FIRST_TASK ; --p)if (*p) (*p)->counter = ((*p)->counter >> 1) + (*p)->priority;}switch_to(next); i and p hold the task's index in the task table (not PID!) and the pointer to task_struct respectively. The key variable is counter in task_struct ((*p)->counter). The scheduler picks up the task with the largest counter value and switches to it. If all runnable tasks have counter value of 0, it updates each task's counter value by counter = (counter >> 1) + priority and restarts the loop. Note that counter >> 1 is a faster way to divide by 2. The key point would be the counter update. It also updates the counter value of non-runnable tasks. This means that if a task is waiting for I/O for a long time, and its priority is higher than 2, counter value will monotonically increase increase until a certain upper bound (edited) when counter is updated. This is just my guess, but I think this is for prioritizing rarely-runnable-but-latency-sensitive tasks like shell, which would waits for keyboard typing in most of the life. Lastly, switch_to(next) is a macro which switches the CPU context to the picked task. It's well described in here. In short, it was based on a x86-specific feature called Task State Segment (TSS), which is no longer used for task management in x86-64 architecture. By the way, there's an interesting comment about the scheduler: * 'schedule()' is the scheduler function. This is GOOD CODE! There * probably won't be any reason to change this, as it should work well * in all circumstances (ie gives IO-bound processes good response etc). Yes it's indeed good code. Unfortunately (or fortunately), this prophecy is false. Linux became one of most practical and performant kernel which has introduced many scheduling improvements and new algorithms over the years, like Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). Kernel panic in 5 lines volatile void panic(const char * s) {printk(\"Kernel panic: %s\\n\\r\",s);for(;;); } Let the user know it went wrong, and hang the system. Period. fork(2) in kernel space? The main portion of kernel initialization can be found in init/main.c (fun fact: this file still exists in today's Linux kernel and initializes the kernel): void main(void)/* This really IS void, no error here. */ { /* The startup routine assumes (well, ...) this */ /* * Interrupts are still disabled. Do necessary setups, then * enable them */time_init();tty_init();trap_init();sched_init();buffer_init();hd_init();sti();move_to_user_mode();if (!fork()) {/* we count on this going ok */ init();} /* * NOTE!! For any other task 'pause()' would mean we have to get a * signal to awaken, but task0 is the sole exception (see 'schedule()') * as task 0 gets activated at every idle moment (when no other tasks * can run). For task0 'pause()' just means we go check if some other * task can run, and if not we return here. */for(;;) pause(); } void init(void) {int i,j;setup();if (!fork()) _exit(execve(\"/bin/update\",NULL,NULL));(void) open(\"/dev/tty0\",O_RDWR,0);(void) dup(0);(void) dup(0);printf(\"%d buffers = %d bytes buffer space\\n\\r\",NR_BUFFERS, NR_BUFFERS*BLOCK_SIZE);printf(\" Ok.\\n\\r\");if ((i=fork())<0) printf(\"Fork failed in init\\r\\n\");else if (!i) { close(0);close(1);close(2); setsid(); (void) open(\"/dev/tty0\",O_RDWR,0); (void) dup(0); (void) dup(0); _exit(execve(\"/bin/sh\",argv,envp));}j=wait(&i);printf(\"child %d died with code %04x\\n\",j,i);sync();_exit(0); /* NOTE! _exit, not exit() */ } It calls each subsystem's initialization functions. Pretty straightforward. But there's something interesting: it calls fork(2) in kernel's main(). Also, init() looks like an ordinary implementation in user space, but it's hardcoded in the kernel code! It looks as if it's fork(2)-ing in the kernel space, but it's actually not. The trick is in move_to_user_mode(): #define move_to_user_mode() \\ __asm__ (\"movl %%esp,%%eax\\n\\t\" \\ // EAX = current stack pointer\"pushl $0x17\\n\\t\" \\ // SS (user data seg)\"pushl %%eax\\n\\t\" \\ // ESP\"pushfl\\n\\t\" \\ // EFLAGS\"pushl $0x0f\\n\\t\" \\ // CS (user code seg)\"pushl $1f\\n\\t\" \\ // EIP (return address)\"iret\\n\" \\ // switch to user mode\"1:\\tmovl $0x17,%%eax\\n\\t\" \\ // IRET returns to this address\"movw %%ax,%%ds\\n\\t\" \\ // Set DS to user data segment\"movw %%ax,%%es\\n\\t\" \\ // Set ES to user data segment\"movw %%ax,%%fs\\n\\t\" \\ // Set FS to user data segment\"movw %%ax,%%gs\" \\ // Set GS to user data segment:::\"ax\") // No RET instruction here:// continue executing following// lines! You don't need to fully understand the assembly code above. What it does is to switch to the user mode using IRET instruction but continue executing the following lines in the kernel code with the current stack pointer! Thus, the following if (!fork()) is executed in user mode and fork(2) is actually a system call. Linus didn't have a machine with 8MB RAM * For those with more memory than 8 Mb - tough luck. I've * not got it, why should you :-) The source is here. Change * it. (Seriously - it shouldn't be too difficult. ... Today, machines with 8GB RAM are very common. Furthermore, 8GB is not enough at all for software engineers ;) Hard to compile with modern toolchains Lastly, I tried to compile the kernel with modern toolchains but failed to do so. I thought GCC (or C itself) has good backward compatibility, but it's not sufficient. Even with older standard -std=gnu90 caused compile errors that are not trivial to fix. One fun fact is Linus had used his own GCC with a feature named -mstring-insns: # If you don't have '-mstring-insns' in your gcc (and nobody but me has :-) # remove them from the CFLAGS defines. I'm not sure what it is, but it seems to be a feature to support (or optimize?) x86 string instructions. If you managed to compile the kernel with modern toolchains, write an article and send me a link :D Read Yourself! I hope you enjoyed reading the source code of Linux v0.01 as much as I did. If you're interested in v0.01, download the tarball of v0.01 from kernel.org. Reading the code is not so hard especially if you've read xv6 before. Linux v0.01 is minimalistic but is very well written. — written by Seiya Nuta CC BY 4.0",

The original OBS was monumental when it came out. Yes, it was a Windows-only code base, with the GUI coded in straight Win32, and didn’t support the extensive array of sources that OBS Studio now does. But it opened instantly, and had the best D3D and OpenGL capture performance available. To my mind OBS Classic single-handedly boosted Twitch streaming to the stratosphere. This happened despite existing and new competition in live streaming apps (primarily Wirecast and XSplit). OBS Classic was just that good for its time. OBS Classic even enabled shared texture capture of Direct3D9 contexts, via a hack to d3d9.dll which had to be maintained for every new major Windows update that came out. OBS Studio carries the torch with a much cleaner cross-platform core library written in C, and better performance and stability, which itself is an achievement.Since OBS Classic is now gone, I’d recommended anyone interested in programming video, audio and cross platform native apps to read through the current OBS Studio code base on GitHub. reply yla92 2 hours agoparentprevWhile I was reading Julia Evan&#x27;s \"Behind \"Hello World\"[0] on Linux, I had some fun digging up the zsh[1] source code.

I just flipped through a lot of Dinosaur book (10th ed) and it&#x27;s not hands-on, though.Back in undergrad in the early 90s, our OS course was we spent the semester building a crappy x86 OS which could boot, run a couple of processes with basic I&#x2F;O and simple signals and memory management. Even though it had nearly zero concepts relevant to modern OS&#x27;s, it was so much fun. It didn&#x27;t set me up in any way to be a serious OS designer, but it was the essence of programming a CPU and some devices, with nothing in between us. I&#x27;d love to experience that again. But I don&#x27;t know where to find resources for the lowest levels: booting into a raw CPU and connecting directly to devices (including display and keyboard). To be sure, I can find plenty of OS texts on advanced memory and process management schemes and so on, but what about the lowest level? reply johndoe0815 4 hours agorootparentOne example is Stephen Marz&#x27; \"The Adventures of OS: Making a RISC-V Operating System using Rust\": https:&#x2F;&#x2F;osblog.stephenmarz.comUnfortunately, this isn&#x27;t updated to work with current RISC V specs, so you will run into a number of problems which can be frustrating... reply taylortbb 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d start with https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.osdev.org&#x2F;Expanded_Main_Page .

Does 36M lines of code in modern Linux mean that the complexity demon is winning? Or do we really, actually need that many?I would love to see a graphical breakdown of how many lines of code, how many functions, etc are used for each major software module. Are there existing tools that do this? reply sthuck 9 hours agoparentYou can use plain old &#x27;wc&#x27; to count lines. Most of the Linux kernel codebase is drivers. 2nd most is architecture specific code.I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the actual count of lines of code that I actually have on the kernel compiled on my specific x64 machine, but I think considering how many significant changes were made to the Linux kernel over the years, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a victim of unnecessary bloat. The various virtualization features alone were industry changing features. reply malux85 9 hours agoparentprevModern linux has 4500x the features as v0.01 - multi CPU architecutre support, better scheduling, better memory allocators, different filesystems, permissions and isolation, more advanced networking, drivers, security.

CPUs of that era did not measure their own temperature, but they also weren&#x27;t trying to squeeze as much juice through as the later Pentium 4s that ran very hot. Modern CPUs are self-regulating and try very hard to avoid damaging themselves even with inadequate cooling. reply Farmadupe 17 hours agoparentprevIm assuming the \"halt and catch fire\" thing is only really possible on pre-microprocessor machines built of discrete components, where the individual parts are small enough to overheat by themselves if driven wrong.I&#x27;d guess the physical CPU package of an i386 would cope just fine with the few (hundreds?) of gates toggling in that small loop.I wonder if it might be possible to do on a modern FPGA, if you artifically create some unstable circuit and pack deliberately it in a corner of the die?There&#x27;s probably some AVX512 concoction that would be the closest equivalent on a modern X64. There&#x27;s probably an easy experiment -- if that concoction makes CPU freq drop and also makes whole-package thermals drop, it &#x2F;could&#x2F; be due to localized die heating. reply userbinator 14 hours agoparentprevAll CPUs didn&#x27;t consume much power back then even at full load (several watts[1]), and thus leaving the CPU in a busy loop was the norm.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cocoon-culture.com&#x2F;lib&#x2F;noise-report&#x2F;external-docs... reply bragr 16 hours agoparentprevNo. Intel CPU&#x27;s, even way before Linux, were microcoded, so you&#x27;re still using the full instruction fetch, decode, and microcode system for every step in your infinite for loop. You aren&#x27;t wearing out the CPU any more than running any other code. reply umanwizard 14 hours agorootparentNone of the instructions likely to be emitted by that loop will be microcoded, and the instruction will always be fetched from L1 cache.

You could HLT the processor and a keyboard interrupt could wake it straight back up and resume execution anywhere in the MS-DOS kernel. It&#x27;s just that the typical TDP of a CPU back then was a couple of watts so there was literally no point in HLTing instead of busy-waiting so nobody bothered. replyjunon 10 hours agoparentprevNope.

    "originBody": "NEWS ▼ CONTACT SUBSCRIBE Record Labels Hit Internet Archive With New $400m+ Copyright Lawsuit yesterday by Andy Maxwell HOME > LAWSUITS > APPS AND SITES > Record labels including UMG, Capitol and Sony have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit in the United States targeting Internet Archive and founder Brewster Kale, among others. Filed in Manhattan federal court late Friday, the complaint alleges infringement of 2,749 works, recorded by deceased artists, including Frank Sinatra, Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong and Bing Crosby. As the Internet Archive continues to deal with an adverse ruling in a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by the world’s largest publishing companies, late Friday some of the world’s largest record labels launched similar legal action in the United States. Filed in Manhattan federal court, the complaint lists UMG Recordings, Capitol Records, Concord Bicycle Assets, CMGI Recorded Music Assets, Sony Music and Arista Music as plaintiffs, with Internet Archive (IA), founder Brewster Kahle, Kahle/Austin Foundation, George Blood and George Blood L.P named as defendants. Pre-1972 78rpm Records by Iconic Artists, All Deceased The plaintiffs’ complaint focuses on the Internet Archive’s ‘Great 78 Project’ which aims to preserve, research and discover 78rpm records produced between 1898 and the 1950s. “While the commercially viable recordings will have been restored or remastered onto LP’s or CD, there is still research value in the artifacts and usage evidence in the often rare 78rpm discs and recordings,” IA wrote following the launch of the project in 2017. “Already, over 20 collections have been selected by the Internet Archive for physical and digital preservation and access. Started by many volunteer collectors, these new collections have been selected, digitized and preserved by the Internet Archive, George Blood LP, and the Archive of Contemporary Music.” From IA’s perspective, the project is all about the preservation of art. From the diametrically opposed view of the plaintiffs, the defendants willfully made copies thousands of recordings to which they own the copyrights. The digitized copies were then uploaded to the Internet Archive from where they were illegally distributed to users of the website millions of times. The complaint lists 2,769 individual works from some of the most fmaous artists of all time, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Miles Davis, and Louis Armstrong. Listed songs include “White Christmas” by Bing Crosby, “Sing, Sing, Sing” by Benny Goodman, “Peggy Sue” by Buddy Holly, and “Roll Over Beethoven” by Chuck Berry. Plaintiffs: Preservation Claims Are a “Smokescreen” The nonprofit Internet Archive is known for its ambitious projects that aim to retain, restore and redistribute content that they believe should never be lost to history. For the plaintiffs, these grand ambitions are nothing but a “smokescreen” to hide what amounts to IA offering “free and unlimited access to music for everyone,” regardless of copyright. “In truth, Defendants’ malfeasance springs from their disregard for copyright law and the rights of artists and content owners. Internet Archive and the other Defendants have a long history of opposing, fighting, and ignoring copyright law, proclaiming that their zealotry serves the public good. In reality, Defendants are nothing more than mass infringers,” the complaint reads. The record companies further reject claims that the music being made available illegally needs to be ‘saved’. They claim that of the 2,749 recordings listed in the complaint, all but a “small sample” are already available to stream or download from licensed online platforms so they “face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed.” The complaint states that when the 78rpm records were converted into digital files, IA reproduced copyrighted recordings without permission. When IA copied those files to a server, that amounted to another unauthorized reproduction, and when it transferred those copies to the public, yet another. When it streamed unlicensed copies to the public, each time that constituted an unlicensed public performance. “When Defendants exploit Plaintiffs’ sound recordings without authorization, neither Plaintiffs nor their artists see a dime. Not only does this harm Plaintiffs and the artists or their heirs by depriving them of compensation, but it undermines the value of music,” the complaint adds. Overall Infringement and Claims For Relief The plaintiffs allege that the Great 78 Project contains more than 400,000 works that have been downloaded or streamed millions of times. In a letter sent by the RIAA to IA in 2020, the plaintiffs allege that IA owner Brewster Kahle was informed of the following: “You and Internet Archive have reproduced thousands of sound recordings in which RIAA member companies own or exclusively control copyrights, and have made those recordings available to the public for unrestricted download and streaming, all without the consent of the rights owners. “Your unauthorized reproduction, distribution and public performance of these recordings is a plain violation of the RIAA member companies’ rights under 17 U.S.C. § 1401, and constitutes nothing less than piracy on a massive scale.” The RIAA says that Kahle and the Internet Archive were ordered to “immediately cease and desist from their infringement” but the demand was ignored. The complaint lists several causes of action against different combinations of defendants, including unlawful reproduction under 17 U.S.C. §§ 106(1) and 1401(a)(1) for which the companies are entitled damages and any profits accrued. Alternatively the record companies seek statutory damages of $150,000 for each protected recording infringed, so with over 2,700 works in suit, damages could exceed $400m. Other claims include infringing reproduction and distribution, infringing public performance, contributory copyright infringement, inducement of infringement, and vicarious copyright infringement. The companies also seek injunctive relief to restrain “continuing infringing conduct.” The complaint and list of sound recordings are available here (1,2, pdf) Previous Post Tagged In: Arista Music Capitol Records RIAA Sony Music UMG Recordings You Might Also Like: ANTI-PIRACY RIAA Urges NTIA to Keep .US Domain WHOIS Info Public to Deter Online Piracy July 26, 2023, 20:47 by Ernesto Van der Sar TECHNOLOGY Former Anti-Piracy Boss Becomes Sony Music’s AI Chief June 27, 2023, 10:21 by Ernesto Van der Sar ANTI-PIRACY RIAA Targets ‘AI Hub’ Discord Users Over Copyright Infringement June 22, 2023, 08:33 by Ernesto Van der Sar Submit a correction or tip.

IA needs a win, even though it doesn&#x27;t need to be paying to defend itself against another lawsuit. This is obviously vexatious. They&#x27;re not really concerned with 78s.

You need to pay rent to a distributor who is allowed to interact with the streaming service. (Some of them offer the convenient feature of administering royalties for cover songs, but it&#x27;s an additional cost and not a given...) Most will probably never make enough royalties to cover the fees.Then you have the whole growing SubmitHub thing. (Pay for consideration on playlists to get exposure.) reply nucleardog 8 hours agorootparentWorked with a company that did stuff like that for a while.My view on it (take it for what you will) is those companies exist mainly as a way for the streaming platforms to outsource and scale their quality control&#x2F;checks.The expectation from platforms like Spotify was basically that anything we sent over can go up without further review and that it added value to the platform, didn’t violate copyright law, was appropriately encoded, etc. If we let anything they rejected or later found issues with through, our status as a distributor was at risk.I expect if Spotify had to staff and scale to deal with the garbage our users were trying, they would end up charging enough extra that you’d pay the same anyway. Basing that mostly on the fact that we weren’t really making much money. reply sethhochberg 10 hours agorootparentprevI do wonder how much the influence of the distributors has helped the streaming music world avoid the problems of the streaming movie&#x2F;TV providers, where content rights are usually exclusive and it’s almost impossible to be an indie serviceThe blessing of the way the music side is set up is that if you want to be an indie streaming music company, you can, you just need to contract with a critical mass of the big distribution houses and royalty reporting agencies and you’ll be able to play pretty much anything your customers might want to hear.

A purist might do that and record from the player’s horn with a mic.One annoyance I encountered in capturing old mono content is the lack of a filter in the audio software I’ve used that would keep only the mono content of a stereo recording.

Making music ubiquitous has been great for stomping out piracy but terrible for revenues. This isn&#x27;t just a problem of underpricing. In the movies and TV space, all the studios found out that exclusive licensing makes more money because you can drag viewers from one subscription service to another. At the most extreme you have shit like the Disney Vault, which works because some creative work is worth more dead than alive.If you were correct we would have stuck with everything being on Netflix and Spotify for $10&#x2F;mo each because it keeps piracy rates down. In practice, while piracy rates have gone back up, they don&#x27;t hurt the bottom lines of publishers as much as they&#x27;ve claimed[0], at least relative to how much they make from people buying multiple subscriptions. But the law allows them to continue crying crocodile tears about how much money they&#x27;re losing from old sound recordings being on an archive site.[0] In other words, one pirate copy is not one lost sale reply naasking 16 hours agorootparent> In the movies and TV space, all the studios found out that exclusive licensing makes more money because you can drag viewers from one subscription service to another.That&#x27;s exactly the kind of shit that drives people to piracy. Then they try to recoup their falling revenue with litigation. It&#x27;s stupid.I also don&#x27;t believe streaming has been that bad for revenue. The financial shenanigans they go through to avoid paying artists, writers and more are insane. It&#x27;s part of the whole impetus behind the current strikes. reply wredue 18 hours agorootparentprevMost people pirate to get stuff for free. If everything was cheaply, easily available, piracy would exist at similar numbers.Now, I do agree that “one pirate number doesn’t necessarily equate to one lost sale”. But that’s not what you’re arguing.Pirates have been saying this for decades, and yet despite content being easier than ever, with pricing falling faster than ever (non-streaming services), piracy is as healthy as ever. If what you were saying is true, you’d expect piracy to have fallen as different people’s barriers for “cheap and easy” were broken through, but that’s not what’s observed. reply OfSanguineFire 17 hours agorootparent> Most people pirate to get stuff for free. If everything was cheaply, easily available, piracy would exist at similar numbers.As the other poster mentioned, the music piracy scene today is a shadow of its old self. There has never again been a private tracker as vast and ambitious as what.cd. Seed numbers are down on lots of remaining trackers. I logged into Soulseek recently (which used to be the obsessive music anorak’s filesharing network) and I can’t find all kinds of things that were widely shared a decade ago.A lot of this is due to the rise of Spotify as a more convenient means of listening. It is also due to so many young people today using their phone as their sole device, which is not very suitable for torrenting and other types of filesharing. reply wredue 17 hours agorootparentIt’s actually because torrenting is harder than downloading YouTube audio streams.People want shit for free.The number of people that openly state that they pirate music has contracted a little bit, but it’s nowhere near “non-existent”. reply OfSanguineFire 16 hours agorootparentIf downloading YouTube audio streams is what music piracy has become today, then I stand by my dismal remarks.

Streaming service fragmentation and geolocking has resulted in more video piracy but it still is less compared to what it was. reply ghaff 17 hours agorootparentAn analyst I know once argued pretty strongly that Napster became popular not because it was free but because it was more convenient than going to the record store and buying a CD. I disagreed fairly strongly at the time. But today? Times are quite different of course but widespread streaming music with a near-universal (at least mainstream) catalog suggests that a ton of people are fine with paying $15&#x2F;month to not bother seeking out content through torrents.While the situation is obviously messier with video, it&#x27;s also the case that many of us don&#x27;t feel a burning need to watch most specific content and are fine with having access to enough stuff we want to watch without hassle. reply giantrobot 16 hours agorootparent> An analyst I know once argued pretty strongly that Napster became popular not because it was free but because it was more convenient than going to the record store and buying a CD.Some context for the younger HN audience: a CD used to cost $15-20 new and almost no artist in the US sold singles. If you wanted a song you heard on the radio you needed to go to one or more record stores to find the CD and pay your $15. Rarely did you get to sample anything on the CD at the store. So you&#x27;d get home only to realize you essentially paid $15 for one stupid song. Hopefully you liked half the songs on the album so you were maybe paying $3 per song you liked. Ripping that CD to MP3 was also more time invested.Even over a 28.8k dial-up downloading the same song of Napster would only take about twenty minutes.As the various online music stores showed, money wasn&#x27;t the main issue with Napster et al. People were fine paying for music so long as it was convenient. By the early 00s buying CDs was far from convenient for how people actually wanted to listen to music. Music streaming is just the latest convenience since everyone has an Internet connected device in their pocket and their \"library\" is just every song in the service&#x27;s catalog. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparent>Music streaming is just the latest convenience since everyone has an Internet connected device in their pocket and their \"library\" is just every song in the service&#x27;s catalog.Yeah, mobile probably played a role as well. Even if you have a few TB of music reasonably cataloged on a USB drive at home, that doesn&#x27;t do you a huge amount of good when you&#x27;re somewhere where you only have access to your phone or want to have a listen to some newly-released album.We&#x27;re also in a situation where if you know someone with vaguely similar music tastes, they could clone that few TB in less than an hour but I honestly don&#x27;t know how much even that goes on these days. My sense is that most people aren&#x27;t interested in spending much time to catalog their media. reply OfSanguineFire 15 hours agorootparent> Even if you have a few TB of music reasonably cataloged on a USB drive at homeI have been pirating artists’ entire discographies across multiple genres, 200 CD box sets, etc. for 20 years now, but I still have barely scratched 1TB -- and that’s even with my collection consisting entirely of FLACs, some of which are large 96&#x2F;24 files or 5.1 surround-sound files. Audio alone just doesn’t take up much space. I don’t think obsessive fans are going to get into a “few TB” unless they are collecting for the sake of collecting, not just building their own personal collection to listen to. And a 1TB collection actually does fit now on your phone thanks to Sandisk offering a 1TB SD card.For films, sure, one is definitely looking at more than “a few TB”. I have a collection of about 600 films, all of which are DVD images or Blu-ray remuxes, and that already amounts to 6TB. With the availability of 4K remuxes that can be up to 100GB each, demands on storage will only grow. reply wredue 17 hours agorootparentprevDid you actually look that up, or are you just believing it cause piracy forums say it?

For the most part, the IA doesn&#x27;t have any more special status than you or I if we were to mirror someone&#x27;s website or create a comic strip museum.A lot of what they make available arguably shouldn&#x27;t be protected by copyright under a rational copyright regime but that&#x27;s an argument to make to Congress rather than saying the IA can do whatever feels justified to them. (Which can cut both ways once you say the law is whatever you personally think is fair.) reply kirksan 17 hours agorootparentThe IA has been skating on thin ice for a long time. They’ve archived a ton of content I generated over the years, most of it copyrighted. In my case I don’t care, I actually appreciate it since I didn’t keep archives as well as I should and occasionally use IA to find my own stuff. Also, my content is worth approximately 25¢. Others are not so forgiving.What we really need are updated copyright laws that allow for research and preservation. However, people have been calling for updated laws for decades, but powerful copyright holders have stood in the way, so don’t hold your breath. reply bscphil 13 hours agorootparent100% agree with this. The biggest issue seems to be that they make no visible effort to find and disable user-uploaded copyright content, so it&#x27;s effectively a free-for-all file sharing site. A lot of the cases are especially egregious because the uploading user will give the content an invalid \"license\" like CC0 that they have no right to apply.I picked three random pieces of recent copyright content (Adobe Lightroom, the video game Hollow Knight, the Taylor Swift album \"Folklore\"), and I found all of them easily and trivially on the Internet Archive. In fact I found hacked versions of the entire Adobe CC suite. The IA is at least as complete a source for pirated content as most public bittorrent trackers.Officially, of course, the Internet Archive is subject to DMCA safe harbor protections. This is user uploaded content, and so long as IA responds quickly to takedown notices, they&#x27;re in the clear. But this story represents the situation de jure, not de facto. Ever since Viacom v. YouTube, it&#x27;s been abundantly clear that even the biggest online platforms can&#x27;t use this excuse in practice when sharing of copyright IP becomes rampant. YouTube put in the first version of their much maligned \"Content ID\" system the year after the Viacom lawsuit, and the parties settled out of court after YouTube lost at the circuit court level. [1]I don&#x27;t believe that the Internet Archive, as a much smaller entity, is likely to see a significantly different outcome - that is, unless the lawsuits manage to bankrupt them entirely. This would suggest they need to be much more proactive about removing or disabling access to copyright content on the platform.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Viacom_International_Inc._v._Y.... reply boomboomsubban 16 hours agorootparentprev>In my case I don’t careIf you did, you could DMCA claim it.

Probably just ask them to take it down. That&#x27;s pretty much how the IA has operated in general.

MARISA KABAS AUG 12, 2023 156 25 Share Photo courtesy of Sam Bailey/Kansas Reflector Very few stories these days take my breath away, but this one did the trick: Cops in Kansas raided the office of local newspaper the Marion County Record Friday morning because of a complaint by a local restaurant owner named Kari Newell. She was unhappy with the outlet’s reporting on how she kicked out reporters from a recent event at her establishment with US Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS) and subsequent research they were conducting. The cops responded in kind, seizing cell phones, computers, and other devices necessary for publishing the paper after receving a signed search warrant from a judge. What has remained unreported until now is that, prior to the raids, the newspaper had been actively investigating Gideon Cody, Chief of Police for the city of Marion. They’d received multiple tips alleging he’d retired from his previous job to avoid demotion and punishment over alleged sexual misconduct charges. The Handbasket is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Subscribe The news of the multiple raids was reported Friday by both the paper itself and by nonprofit news service Kansas Reflector. After receiving an alert from the Kansas Press Association, Reflector Editor-in-Chief Sherman Smith said he quickly understood the gravity of the situation. “My immediate reaction: This is an attack on all journalists, and we have to respond,” Sherman told The Handbasket in an email Friday night. “My staff and I stopped what we were doing and directed our attention to reporting this story.” I reached out to Eric Meyer, owner and publisher of the Marion County Record, late Friday evening to get his reaction to the unprecedented raids and to learn about any new updates in the case. Below is our conversation, edited for length and clarity. Subscribe Marisa Kabas: I wanted to check in and see if there had been any updates since the raids yesterday. Eric Meyer: We’ve pieced together enough equipment so that we'll probably be able to put out our paper. Our big question is how to get the material for it, which we don't have any of. I mean, I'm gonna have to go hunting to find the name plate for the front page. But other than that, we're doing ok. Been in lots of talks with lots of lawyers. That's pretty much the long and short of it, I guess for now. Just getting started on rebuilding everything. So, we've got a bit of work to do with that. MK: And what are the lawyers telling you right now? EM: That the people who did this are going to learn a very expensive lesson. Their real question was, from a legal standpoint, was it more important that we get it [the newspaper’s equipment] back right now, or is it more important that we—for lack of a better word—stick it to them? We’re able to survive now, and I don't really want to stick it to anybody, but we need to have something that's big enough to convince somebody that you really don't do this. Not in America. This is not something that you do here. So, we'll be working in that direction. MK: When the raids happened, were you at the office or were you at your home? EM: I was at my home. I stay here with my 98-year-old mother and she was actually waiting for her meal to arrive from Meals on Wheels. And I thought when I heard the knocking, that was a meal person. I know they normally just leave it outside and no, it was a couple of police officers. I immediately tried to call the newspaper and I couldn't get through to the newspaper because they had raided them at the same time and forced them to go outside. So, although I did have a landline here—the advantage of living with a 98 year old woman is you've got a landline!—they couldn't answer at the Record. At the newspaper office, they'd been forced to leave the office. We weren't forced to leave the house here. But my mother is very upset about having police in her house for several hours. They stood here for a long time. I got in the car and left to go down to the newspaper office. And actually along the way had to stop because I couldn't find phone numbers [since all his devices had been seized]. I wanted to call the attorney we normally use from the open government coalition that usually provides initial consulting for us, and I didn't have his phone number. So I actually stopped at somebody's house along the way and said, can I borrow your tablet to look up a phone number and then borrow your phone to make a call? MK: So when the police arrived at your door, what was initially running through your head? EM: I had no idea what they were doing there. They said “we’re here to execute a search warrant.” And at that point, I kind of figured out what it was, because of the blustering that I'd heard from Kari earlier in the week. But, yeah, I didn't know quite what they wanted to do. I said, “guys, you're really making a very serious mistake here.” But what ran through my head was the old saying that when the police say something, you've got to do it. There's time to object to it later. Don't object to it then, or they can charge you with interfering with law enforcement. So I just told them that I thought they were making a serious mistake and they said they're just doing their jobs. And being a small enough town, I knew who they were. One of them was a part-time officer and he was wearing his bulletproof vest on the outside, and I know the new uniform requirements in the city, where they're supposed to wear it on the inside of their shirt. My mother got very, very, very, very upset about this and about that time her lunch did arrive, and she never did eat it yesterday. She refused to eat it. In fact, she refused to eat anything. She refused to go to bed last night. She sat up all night. She was very upset about this. They came into her home. She did nothing wrong. MK: That's very upsetting, I can imagine. And what has it been like having all this attention all of a sudden? EM: It's not wanted attention, let's put it that way. It is kind of heartwarming: One of the things that I just noticed was we got this incredible swelling of people buying subscriptions to the paper off of our website. We got a lot of them, including some—I'm not gonna say who they're from—but one of them is an extremely famous movie producer and screenwriter who came in and subscribed to the paper all of a sudden. I mean, it's like, why are people from Poughkeepsie, New York and Los Angeles, California and Seattle, Washington and, you know, all these different places subscribing to the paper? But a lot of people seem to want to help, and we've had people calling, asking “where can I send money to help you?” And, well, we don't need money right now. We just are gonna have a long weekend of work to do. But we'll catch up. [At this point, Meyer explained the backstory as reported by his paper and the Kansas Reflector: He and his reporter Phyllis Zorn were kicked out of an August 2nd meeting at a local establishment with US Congressman Jake LaTurner (R-KS) by the City of Marion Police Chief after restaurant owner Kari Newell demanded they leave. Meyer and Zorn published a subsequent story about the hostile encounter, which infuriated Newell and prompted angry Facebook posts. The paper then received a tip about Newell having her license suspended in 2008 after a DUI, checked it out, decided not to publish it, and ultimately shared it with the local police because they believed it might’ve been shared with them as part of Newell’s ongoing divorce battle. The police then told Newell what the newspaper shared, and she attended Monday’s City Council meeting to make outrageous claims about the newspaper and one of the council members (who had also obtained the letter) violating her rights. She also called Meyer later that evening and erroneously accused him of identity theft. Not even four days later, police arrived at the newspaper office, Meyer’s home and the council member’s home with search warrants signed by a judge.] EM: So the backstory that we haven't told, because we don't wanna get in trouble, is that we've been investigating the police chief [Gideon Cody]. When he was named Chief just two months ago, we got an outpouring of calls from his former co-workers making a wide array of allegations against him saying that he was about to be demoted at his previous job and that he retired to avoid demotion and punishment over sexual misconduct charges and other things. We had half a dozen or more different anonymous sources calling in about that. Well, we never ran that because we never could get any of them to go on the record, and we never could get his personnel file. But the allegations—including the identities of who made the allegations—were on one of the computers that got seized. I may be paranoid that this has anything to do with it, but when people come and seize your computer, you tend to be a little paranoid. MK: I just wanna make sure I'm 100% clear: so you haven't reported on this before? EM: We've gathered a lot of information. Deb, one of our reporters, has worked for weeks on this story. And we kind of didn't get anywhere with it. We tried to alert the city through backdoor channels that they needed to really look at his employment record. They said, “oh, we have,” and we talked to the Kansas City, Missouri Police where he was from, and the Human Resources Department said, “no, nobody's ever looked at his record.” Then two days later, somebody did look at it after they'd already told us they'd done so. But the Kansas City Missouri Police HR Department told us, they [the city of Marion] asked specifically for only those things in which he [Cody] had been convicted and disciplinary action had been taken. And so that's all they gave him. This action wasn't completed. So that was where we kind of had to leave the story. They went ahead and hired him. MK: So you feel comfortable publicly saying that you would have been investigating the police chief? EM: I wouldn't feel comfortable printing individual allegations, but it is true that we were investigating him and we had decided not to run anything at this point. We're not making any allegations against him, but we had investigated allegations. Subscribe MK: Have you heard from Congressman LaTurner since the police raids? EM: No, we have not. But again, it is so hard to reach us right now. Unless you have this landline [Ed note: we were speaking via his home landline that he’d provided via email] and I happen to be there, or the other landline [at the office] and I happen to be there. I haven't seen any email from them, nor have I received any calls from them. MK: With all the national attention, what should people outside Kansas know about Marion? EM: It’s a very small rural community. I worked at the Milwaukee Journal for 20 years and then taught at the University of Illinois. And they'd say, where are you from? And I'd say I'm from Kansas. And they’d say where in Kansas? And I'd say, if you've heard of any place in Kansas, it’s 60 miles from there. It's kind of out in the middle of nowhere. We are on the boundary of an area code. We're on the boundary of three zip codes. We're on the boundary between two TV markets. It's a farming community that also has some resort activities. We have a couple of lakes which in Kansas is kind of unusual. But mostly it's a farming community. But other than that, it's like a lot of small towns. We are unusual in that running the paper isn't my livelihood. I mean, I retired from the University of Illinois. I still have a pension from the Milwaukee Journal. I haven't even taken my social security yet. And I don't take a salary, unless I take a bonus at the end of the year if we made any money from the newspaper. So I don't get regularly paid, and it's not my livelihood. I'm doing this because I believe that newspapers still have a place in the world and that the worst thing that a newspaper could do was shrink its reporting staff, stop reporting, fill itself with non-news when there's still news out there. And if you do a good job of providing news, you will get readers. We try to be aggressive with the news and we try to be fearless with the news because as I say, we're doing this because we care about the community. And that's one of the points I've tried to make, is that it's really hard to commit journalism properly with people who don't care about the community they're serving. MK: I just wanted to end with one last question: What do you think this raid on your paper and on your home says about the state of journalism in the country right now? EM: I haven't been able to see enough of the outpouring from the people in this town. We've been getting incredible support from people outside this town. People in this town have been very supportive, but not publicly. And I talked to one person who said, “Oh, are you sure It's ok that I can talk to you because they might come and seize my computer?” They're afraid. They're really afraid that the police power is unchecked, and that they can be punished like this. And I think that's why I think it's important for us to fight this as much as we can, because it is destroying everything we're trying to do with democracy, which is to get people more involved. We've been trying to get people involved because people are afraid that if they step up—in a small town particularly—they will get squashed. Someone will knife them in the back. They will tell all their friends to stop doing business with them, or they will shun them, or they won't take them to the country club. It’s a way to dispirit people from becoming involved in government by making them think that if you do, there's gonna be consequences and they're going to be negative. And in a community that's largely a lot of older people, a lot of them have said, you know, I've fought all the battles. I don't want to have a new battle that I'm dealing with. So they'll all complain about something, but they'll do it very quietly. We won't hear about it. Tips? Email MKwrites4000@proton.me The Handbasket is a reader-supported publication.

These are the stories one sees in the midst of rising authoritarianism. For two reasons - number one, authoritarians lie. Constantly, to the point of being untrustworthy and dangerous to everyone around them. Thus, they have to control the narrative. State media - always. Number two, they can't help themselves and must act. This is how we see policies that attack women’s reproductive rights, trans rights, and DEI initiatives. It starts with, ”Well, we don't want our kids surrounded by drag queens.” This always morphs into, ”You know what? We won't allow this to be taught in college, either.” Outlawing homosexuality is of course a natural next step. Just as we knew that the downfall of Roe v Wade was and is not about state’s rights. It is all about having a fertilized egg automatically given full rights, regardless of the mother’s opinion. They want fetal personhood as law. I struggle to see how people don't see these things, or how more people do not see these things. LIKE (33) REPLY 1 reply Marlene Reil 16 hrs ago Great reporting!

Thank you and sorry for confusion. reply hgsgm 14 hours agorootparentThe actual title is much better than this gore.A conversation with the newspaper owner raided by cops reply runnerup 14 hours agorootparentThe title as it is this moment on HN was better for me at least, it made it clear that it was in context of ongoing investigative research done by the newspaper against the police. reply TedDoesntTalk 13 hours agorootparentBut it’s missing a key piece of information: the paper was investigating allegations against the newly-hired police chief who was in charge of the raid. reply leereeves 15 hours agoparentprevI agree, \"his\" is ambiguous at best and seems to refer to the police chief (a person) rather than the paper (an organization).A simple change would make it clear:Paper investigating police chief prior to the raids on owner&#x27;s office and home reply TheFreim 15 hours agoparentprev> But it was the newspaper owner, not the police chief, who was raided.That&#x27;s what the title means. reply JshWright 15 hours agorootparentIt’s definitely a confusing title though, as the pronoun “his” seems way more likely to refer to the police chief than the “paper”. reply froggit 15 hours agorootparentAgreed. Last I checked, papers don&#x27;t have a gender, therefore a gender specific pronoun is incorrect.Regardless, the title has since been edited. Controversy resolved, maybe now we can discuss the topic x.x reply TheFreim 15 hours agorootparentprevHow many newspapers engage in raids upon police chiefs? Clearly it&#x27;s the police who is doing the raiding. reply JshWright 15 hours agorootparentThe title doesn’t say the newspaper engaged in the raid. There are other agencies that could raid a police chief’s home. It would be reasonable to assume some agency like the FBI conducted the raid based on the same information that prompted the investigation. That’s not actually the case here, but I think that is a way more plausible reading of the sentence. reply paxys 15 hours agorootparentprevThen it should say \"paper owner\" not \"paper\". reply echelon_musk 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely.If the surname of the newspaper&#x27;s owner happened to also be Paper, then this might make sense. Otherwise it is very wrong. reply halfdan 15 hours agorootparentprevIt’s ambiguous and I also read “him” as the police chief being raided. reply hinkley 15 hours agorootparentBecause &#x27;police chief&#x27; is the only potential gendered identifier in the entire title. reply eis 15 hours agorootparentprevThe title on HN at the current time [0] says the police chief was raided.There is only one person mentioned and therefor \"his\" can only refer to that person. \"His\" can not refer to the newspaper.[0] \"Paper investigating police chief prior to the raids on his office and home.\" reply hinkley 15 hours agorootparentI just clicked on the thread now and it still is listed as mentioned by GP. reply TheFreim 15 hours agorootparentprevIt says that the paper investigating the police chief was raided. I don&#x27;t know many news papers that engage in raids on police, so it&#x27;s pretty clear. reply JshWright 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t say the paper was the entity engaged in the raid. If I didn’t know the broader context, I would assume that sentence meant “A newspaper was investigating a police chief at the time the police chief’s home was raided by another law enforcement agency”. That seems way more likely than a newspaper being referred to as “him”. reply xdavidliu 15 hours agorootparentprevnot a single person here agrees with you. The title didnt say who performed the raiding. A police chief could be raided by the FBI. reply jahsome 15 hours agorootparentprevNo, it&#x27;s not. The current title omits the raised person altogether. reply TheFreim 15 hours agorootparentHow is it that despite not having yet read the article I knew EXACTLY what it meant? The pedantic and intentionally obtuse nitpickery in this thread is silly and absurd. reply jahsome 14 hours agorootparentThis is a community of people whose career revolves around precise language.You knew because you&#x27;re intelligent and were able to piece things together. Many in society are not so fortunate for one reason of another and so it&#x27;s important to be precise. reply matsemann 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause the title is changed now, but was something else half an hour ago. replybastardoperator 15 hours agoprevPolice in the US are becoming lawless gangs. Abolish qualified immunity. Stop having taxpayers&#x27; foot the bill, start using their pension fund and watch police make a 180 degree turn in terms of behavior and professionalism. reply ghastmaster 15 hours agoparentQualified immunity does not protect government employees who break the law. There are laws&#x2F;rulings that specifically disqualify them from using qualified immunity as a defense. The problem is prosecutors, judges, and juries who allow government employees to commit illegal actions with no consequences. This is furthered by citizens who pay no attention and let these people stay in power. reply qingcharles 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s near impossible to even charge a cop or a prosecutor with a crime. I had cops and prosecutors commit crimes against me, but I ran into dead ends every which way I tried to even file police reports etc. Not a single police agency will take a report against an officer or a prosecutor. And in theory you can report crimes directly to a prosecutor&#x27;s office, but again, they won&#x27;t take reports against police officers (who are the ones that keep them in business) nor other prosecutors.I don&#x27;t know what the solution is.Chicago has an agency specifically to report police misconduct, but it seems to get shut down every couple of years due to rampant misconduct inside the agency. reply sobkas 13 hours agorootparentprevOf course it does, especially when they don&#x27;t know that they are breaking it.So much for \"ignorance of the law excuses not\", it does if you are a cop.And for someone who invented “clearly established right\"...And if prosecutor doesn&#x27;t want to prosecute cops, judge, jury, etc. isn&#x27;t even involved.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supreme.findlaw.com&#x2F;supreme-court-insights&#x2F;pros-vs-c... reply squeaky-clean 13 hours agorootparentprevIt does protect them from civil suits, which have a lower bar for the burden of proof. When a citizen does manage to win damages in a civil case, it is paid by the city (aka the taxpayers). It should be paid from the police pension or an individual insurance similar to malpractice insurance. reply opo 12 hours agorootparentprev>Qualified immunity does not protect government employees who break the law.Well qualified immunity doesn&#x27;t apply to criminal cases, but civil suits are generally the only way survivors and their families can get compensation for violations of their rights.Reading about egregious conduct where the government was somehow able to be granted qualified immunity will make anyone wonder how we could allow this to happen. reply mikem170 15 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s a neat idea. Too often miscreants face no consequences worse than being suspended for a while, with pay.Something needs to change with Internal Affairs, also. Local police departments are often investigating themselves, with predictable results. reply Dah00n 14 hours agorootparentBut none of this would stick without judge, jury and lawyers colluding, surely? Seems to me the problem isn&#x27;t the police but is systemic. reply crazygringo 14 hours agoparentprev\"Becoming\"?I&#x27;m pretty sure the evidence points to the contrary -- police are less corrupt than ever before.That doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t still corruption (such as is claimed in this case), but you&#x27;re claiming this is something getting worse.I really don&#x27;t think you want to go back to policing in the 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s. reply itronitron 13 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanheritage.com&#x2F;battle-athens reply sobkas 13 hours agorootparentprevWell maybe because stealing, getting bribed by rich(individuals or corps) and doing nothing to serve and protect became legal. They no longer need to break law, when they can make same things within the law. reply crazygringo 13 hours agorootparentMy point remains that this has always been the case and if anything is getting better, not worse.You can always cherry-pick examples of individual things getting worse, but I ask again: do you really want to go back to the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s? Because yikes. reply raincom 15 hours agoparentprevProsecutors, judges, law enforcement agents all belong to the same group: so, they collude in the name of co-operation; they are paid by the government. They are the enforcers of \"state monopoly on violence\". Usually, these folks (prosecutors, judges, LE agents) don&#x27;t want to step on the powerful elite, as the latter can take these cases all the way to SCOTUS to clamp down on abuses. That&#x27;s why prosecutors use \"prosecutorial discretion\" to NOT prosecute so that these cases won&#x27;t get appealed further.When elites splinter into two groups, that&#x27;s when you see some progress. Otherwise, two-tier justice is a common, hidden, feature of any system out there (be it Western democracy, communist, dictatorship, etc). reply shrubble 15 hours agoparentprevThere is a &#x27;Bivens claim&#x27; but I have no idea how easy it is to use, and whether its scope extends beyond federal police officers... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;bivens_action reply jimbob45 15 hours agoparentprevAbolishing qualified immunity leads to situations like Uvalde where police don’t want to intervene for fear of reprisal.Also, you’re probably barking up the wrong tree. Instead of pissing off the police unions and dealing with the eternal backlash from that, you could instead push for something like Florida’s Sunshine Laws which would provide needed transparency into universities, the police, and the government. reply kibwen 14 hours agorootparent> Abolishing qualified immunity leads to situations like Uvalde where police won’t want to intervene for fear of reprisal.This couldn&#x27;t be more wrong. Despite the existence of qualified immunity, the Texas police still cowered like cowards, and are using qualified immunity to shield themselves from the lawsuits of the families whose children they failed to protect. reply Asooka 13 hours agorootparentEven without qualified immunity, the police in question would not face any charges, as they have no duty to protect anyone from anything. reply delecti 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by \"fear of reprisal\"? It seemed pretty clear to me that they didn&#x27;t want to head in for fear of confronting someone who can shoot back for a change. reply vGPU 14 hours agorootparentIndeed. Hence, we get the latest FBI public execution of a “right wing terrorist”: a 75 year old obese mobility-scooter-bound vet. reply ozaark 13 hours agorootparentIdk much about the situation but in a few of that guys posts he made prior to being raided he talked about sniping potusa from afar with time, place in mind, pictures of him with rifles, and threats to answer FBI with guns. Afaik obese scooter bound people can still aim a rifle from afar. He basically provoked a situation and was treated as credible threat based on his own actions. reply hcayless 14 hours agorootparentprevBut QI still exists, and Uvalde happened. It wasn’t fear of reprisal, but fear of being shot. So your argument doesn’t work. reply tehwebguy 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah, 370 cops stood around doing nothing while children and teachers were murdered because they were afraid of “reprisal”.They were afraid of getting shot, total cowardice with a lot of incompetence and nothing more. reply quickthrowman 14 hours agorootparentprevUvalde cops had (and have) qualified immunity, yet they still didn’t take action. Perhaps they were more afraid of being shot? reply MarkMarine 14 hours agorootparentprevFear of reprisalAnd in this age people really don’t care as long as they wield power.At least the _ideal_ was that this was a government by the people for the people. The goal being to align incentives to wield power appropriately. When you misuse your power against the people, the people take away your power. reply rob74 14 hours agorootparentHowever, if you manage to convince the people (or at least a significant percentage of the people) that the journalists you are going up against are just peddlers of \"fake news\", you might get away with it... reply SamoyedFurFluff 15 hours agoprevNot only was this newspaper reporting on a restaurant owners DUI, it was investigating sexual misconduct by the former police chief!!!

That situation doesn&#x27;t get press. This situation is a lesson to every newspaper that might out of line, not to do so.That is to say, you&#x27;re confused. Corruption is the usual thing a small American city. A paper reporting when it gets out-of-hand is unusual. Cops screwing with the paper or anyone who reports their dirty dealings is normal. Cops getting flack when they do this happens but often they just get away it. Even when the cops get flack in the press, they usually come out OK in the long run. Even a paper gets a lot support and congratulations in the short, they often wind-up screwed in the long run.And sure, a raid is kind of a crude reaction.

It&#x27;s a place where you keep your head down reply chmod600 15 hours agoprevThis story omits the most crucial information: why was the warrant issued?Judges issuing warrants is one of the least accountable aspects of our legal system. Warrants can cause major damage, disruption, or even death. There are never consequences for a mistake (cf. Breonna Taylor incident).They can also cause political interference and there&#x27;s little mechanism to prevent abuses. The FISA warrants against Carter Page were later declared invalid[1]. Document mishandling sometimes resulted in essentially nothing (Clinton, Biden) and sometimes warrants and raids (Trump). There could be good reasons for all of this but there&#x27;s not really any mechanism to sort it out. Next time there might not be good reasons, and the target might be a politician we desperately need (rather than Trump). reply J_Shelby_J 15 hours agoparentI&#x27;m an advocate of privacy for this reason.A corrupt LEO can get a warrant to search your house easily, and so getting a warrant for a (completely automated process!) that hands them your entire digital life is even easier. It just takes a message to google&#x2F;apple&#x2F;meta and they have access to.... your digital soul, basically.Big brother is scary, but corruption at the local level is a very real threat to individuals and democracy as a whole. Imagine trying to run an election against a small town sheriff who is willing to abuse their power. Within a local political system complacent in that abuse? This isn&#x27;t hypothetical. The judge in this case approved this warrant.Anti-privacy efforts like the current trend of anti-encryption proposals really need to be better labeled as anti-democratic by the politically active. reply jonnycomputer 15 hours agoparentprevI see your point, but bringing in national politics is going to totally derail this conversation, imo. reply throw3823423 15 hours agoparentprevDocument mishandling can lead to a slap on the wrist if you let the investigators come in and take a look (Clinton, Biden), but if you refuse to give investigators access, and brazenly lie to them about the documents you still keep, then their only option is warrants and raids (Trump). Then they might indict you, but only about documents that you didn&#x27;t hand back when they asked for them.If we call every legal action against a political candidate political interference, we have two systems of justice, and all you need to do to have no consequences is to keep running for office. Then any investigations on you or your family become a witch hunt.The mechanism to sort it out is that the data must come to light at trial, and people can make their own minds regarding whether the investigation did everything that was remotely reasonable to get cooperation or not. But then again, thanks to the US media environment that is more interested in entertaining than informing, people&#x27;s opinions might have little to do with reality, thanks to their own political biases. That allows someone to, on the campaign trail, call for locking up the opposition candidate, while claiming that everything is a witch hunt when any investigation heads in their direction. reply predictabl3 14 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t care.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content tRPC Docs Quickstart Awesome tRPC Collection Using Next.js 10.x Search K Move Fast and Break Nothing. End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy. Experience the full power of TypeScript inference to boost productivity for your full-stack application. Star 27,934 Quickstart SUPPORTED BY 37 more Many thanks to all of our amazing sponsors! Automatic typesafety Made a server side change? TypeScript will warn you of errors on your client before you even save the file! Snappy DX tRPC has no build or compile steps, meaning no code generation, runtime bloat or build step. Framework agnostic Compatible with all JavaScript frameworks and runtimes. It's easy to add to your existing projects. Autocompletion Using tRPC is like using an SDK for your API's server code, giving you confidence in your endpoints. Light bundle size tRPC has zero dependencies and a tiny client-side footprint making it lightweight. Batteries included We provide adapters for React, Next.js, Express, Fastify, AWS Lambda, Solid, Svelte, and more. Simple to use with unmatched developer experience It's quick and easy to get started with tRPC to build a typesafe API. const t = initTRPC.create(); const router = t.router; const publicProcedure = t.procedure; const appRouter = router({ greeting: publicProcedure .input(z.object({ name: z.string() })) .query((opts) => { const { input } = opts; const input: { name: string; } return `Hello ${input.name}` as const; }), }); export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter; 1 Define your procedures The first step to creating a tRPC API is to define your procedures. Procedures are the functions we will use to build your backend. They're composable and can be queries, mutations, or subscriptions. Routers contain multiple procedures. In this procedure, we use a Zod validator to ensure the input from the client has exactly the shape that our procedure expects. We will also return a simple text string from the query. At the end of the file, we export the type of the router so we can use it in our frontend code in just a few moments. const { listen } = createHTTPServer({ router: appRouter, }); // The API will now be listening on port 3000! listen(3000); 2 Create your HTTP server Next, we create our HTTP server using our appRouter. We now have a tRPC server running! tRPC has many adapters so it can meet you where you are. Next.js, Express, the Fetch API (Astro, Remix, SvelteKit, Cloudflare Workers, etc.), Fastify, AWS Lambda, or a vanilla Node HTTP server. const trpc = createTRPCProxyClient({ links: [ httpBatchLink({ url: 'http://localhost:3000', }), ], }); const res = await trpc.greeting.query({ name: 'John' }); const res: `Hello ${string}` 3 Connect your client and start querying! Now that we have the server running, we can create a client and start querying data. We pass the AppRouter type when creating the client to give us TypeScript autocompletion and Intellisense that matches the backend API without requiring any code generation! Try it out for yourself! Node.js Next.js This is a minimal Node.js application using tRPC. Loading sandbox... Use this template You may not need a traditional API \"I built tRPC to allow people to move faster by removing the need of a traditional API-layer, while still having confidence that our apps won't break as we rapidly iterate.\" Try it out for yourself and let us know what you think! Alex/KATT Creator of tRPC Don't take our word for it! Many developers are loving tRPC and what it brings to them. Theo - ping.gg @t3dotgg Sep 19 The amount that tRPC has improved the quality of our code, the speed of our delivery, and the happiness of our devs is hard to comprehend. I know I shill it a lot but seriously, please try @trpcio R. Alex Anderson 🚀 @ralex1993 Sep 23 🤯 tRPC 10 enables VS Code's \"Change All Occurrences\" feature to work _across the client/server boundary_!

Dodds 🌌 @kentcdodds Sep 20 If I didn't already get end-to-end type safety from @remix_run, I would 100% be investigating @trpcio very seriously. If you're not on Remix, I suggest you give it a look 👀 Sock, the dev 🧦 @sockthedev Sep 13 If you are all in on TypeScript you MUST use tRPC for your API. No ifs, no buts. tRPC destroys the boundary between frontend and backend. You get to focus on building features for your app. Best tool for time to market hyper mode.

It&#x27;s been a nightmare of tight coupling. I&#x27;ve also found that it encourages more junior developers to not think about interfaces &#x2F; data access patterns (there&#x27;s a mapping from Prisma straight through to the component). It&#x27;s fantastic for rapid prototyping but really paints you into a corner if you ever want to decouple the codebase. reply miraantabrez 18 hours agoparentThis is the overlooked advantage of a schema (e.g. in GraphQL): it forces you to think about the data types and contract, and serves as a good way to align people working on different parts of the code. It also scales to other languages besides TypeScript which helps if you ever want to migrate your backend to something else or have clients in other languages (e.g. native mobile apps in Swift, Kotlin, etc). reply spankalee 18 hours agorootparentTypeScript is actually a great schema language and fixes a number of problems in GraphQL&#x27;s SDL, especially the lack of generics.I think if you&#x27;re defining a JSON API, that TypeScript is a natural fit since its types line up with with JSON - ie, number is the same in both and if you want something special like an integer with more precision, then you have to model it the same way in your JSON as your TypeScript interfaces (ie, a string or array). This makes TS good even for backends and frontends in other languages. You can also convert TS interfaces to JSON Schema for more interoperability. reply tshaddox 15 hours agorootparentIt’s not a perfect mapping with JSON. Everyone knows that stuff like functions and dates can’t go over JSON, but there are also subtler things, like the fact that undefined can’t exist as a value in JSON. I’ve seen codebases get pretty mixed up about the semantics of things like properties being optional versus Tundefined. reply Cannabat 10 hours agorootparentprevTS is a pain with JSON Schema or OpenAPI because it doesn&#x27;t directly support things like integer or precision. TS does not easily support things like `\"exclusiveMinimum\": 5`, `\"type\": \"integer\"` or patterned (regex) fields.So if you want to convert your TS interfaces to JSON Schema, you may need to provide additional constraints via JSDoc and use a generator that understands those annotations. But your TS interfaces cannot express those constraints directly.There are a number other related complications surrounding these more expressive schema definitions - like building types from them and interacting with them at runtime. reply pcthrowaway 8 hours agorootparentYou can easily express constraints like these with Zod though (created by the same person who created tRPC v1) reply throwawaymaths 11 hours agorootparentprevJesus, if you&#x27;re making a JSON API just use JSONSchema, which while not perfect, is quite nice for language interop (and more powerful than typescript) reply jitl 11 hours agorootparent> just use JSONSchemaI&#x27;ll \"just\" use the type system built into my programming language until the pain of supporting multiple languages is more expensive than installing JSONSchema tooling and messing with code generation. reply thinkingkong 17 hours agoparentprevWe implemented tRPC at work and use all the other things that would have been &#x27;tightly coupled&#x27; within our code base had we not planned a tiny bit ahead. tRPC is incredible but it&#x27;s still just the transport layer between your back-end and your front-end. Allowing the internals of tRPC to be used deep within your business logic is just as bad as not having a clear &#x27;controller&#x27; or &#x27;router&#x27; layer where you can cleanly define inputs, schemas, and keep things separated. In this sense, if we ever decided to move from tRPC it would be relatively straightforward. Lifting an entire sub-system and running it over a queue for example would be trivial. reply epolanski 18 hours agoparentprevCould you expand on the nightmare of coupling?I don&#x27;t see how declaring an http client server side and consuming it client-side can be a worse thing.We use the same pattern of creating services that then every consumer can use (a web interface, a cli, etc) and the fact that those things never get to break is a massive improvement over anything I&#x27;ve seen in the past. reply haney 15 hours agorootparentIf you only ever use Typescript and are sure you’ll never need to interact with the code in any other language or service in a different repo it’s fine. But as soon as you need to reuse that backend for anything else you’re stuck building something new. reply vosper 14 hours agorootparentYou can make calls to tRPC endpoints from anything that can send an HTTP request. The RPC format for requests might not be your cup of tea, but it works. reply welder 18 hours agoparentprevHaving the opposite experience with it as a small team, and I can see how it would work great in my past large teams. I bet you&#x27;re gonna have the same complaints about any API you use not just tRPC (junior developers not thinking about interfaces). reply haney 15 hours agorootparentI’m willing to admit that poor usage can make any tool a problem. But, tRPC is set up to make it easy to directly expose your backend for use in a component. For new projects that’s fantastic, for larger projects and teams having the ‘friction’ of defining a gRPC, GraphQL or REST endpoint is leading to more thoughtful API design and ability to keep isolation between layers. reply welder 49 minutes agorootparent> having the ‘friction’ of defining a gRPC, GraphQL or REST endpoint is leading to more thoughtful API designMake devs slower so they code smarter?More friction is just that, it just frustrates devs it doesn&#x27;t make them code better.tRPC enables good teams to ship faster. Less friction means doing what the team was already going to do anyway, but faster. reply macrael 10 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a dangerous anti-pattern to pass your db types through to your api handlers. Those are always different models and it&#x27;s important to have an intermediary representation for the rest of your domain. reply calebio 8 hours agorootparentAgreed. Although, sometimes it feels like this is a losing battle. I&#x27;ve worked with too many people who see that level of separation as \"unneeded duplication\", with constant complaints about having to update a bunch of different layers \"just to add a new field.IMO, at a minimum, you have your API layer model, your internal model, and your database model with a mapping layer at each boundary.I rarely have problems when I structure it that way, but when working on applications that pass the same model from their API down to their database, or vice-versa, it&#x27;s always full of the same types of problems that comes with tight coupling. reply macrael 3 hours agorootparentI think there are certain types of boilerplate that used to be truly onerous that are now much less so because of types. If there are 3 different files that need to be updated to add a file, and forgetting one is only going to error at runtime (maybe even only if you&#x27;re exercising that new field) that&#x27;s horrible. But 3 files that require updating where the code won&#x27;t compile until you&#x27;ve added all three is way way less of a problem. reply senorrib 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is exactly my experience. Glad to see I&#x27;m not alone, sad to hear that it&#x27;s so common out there. reply Swizec 18 hours agoparentprevYour problem isn’t tRPC, your problem is that you have engineers who type things for typing’s sake. They’ll have the same problem in any tool.There’s a learning curve to these things. It always starts with type FunctionIWroteTodayArgs = …, which is useless and tells you nothing.After a few iterations (this takes years) people gradually realize that the goal is to describe your domain and create types&#x2F;interfaces&#x2F;apis that are reusable and informative, not just a duplication of your code. You then get more useful types and things start really flying.I guess what I’m saying is work on that with your team, not on ripping out tRPC. reply killthebuddha 17 hours agorootparent+1. Almost every time I actually write out a type it&#x27;s because I want to communicate some domain knowledge. For everything else I use inferred types. IMO this is The Way. reply dclowd9901 16 hours agorootparentprevEh? Useless? Maybe you’ve not written generic Javascript before but “type FunctionIWroteTodayArgs” has eliminated an entire class of problems we used to face with JS code.If you’re talking about decoupled services, that’s about business domain composition more than type description. And those types benefit from a higher level description&#x2F;reusability&#x2F;transportability. reply Swizec 16 hours agorootparentFair, it’s not literally useless, it does help with typos and autocomplete. But you can get so much more with just 10% extra care in how you design your interfaces that the lazy approach feels almost useless by comparison.It’s similar to the problems you run into by writing the wrong kind of tests – the ones that essentially just duplicate your code instead of validating input&#x2F;output at boundaries. reply random_kris 18 hours agoparentprevCare to elaborate further? I&#x27;ve been building on top of trpc and even for inter service communication we use it reply alexdotjs 17 hours agoparentprevWe a tool bring which lets you track schema changes it over time and also ability to have an approval workflow for schema changes.Would that help your team?Happy to give you a demo if you reach out on Twitter dms or email (alex@trpc.io) reply replygirl 17 hours agorootparentis it git? reply yieldcrv 16 hours agoparentprevour problem with tRPC is that we don&#x27;t have an easy to way to test the endpoint in say, curl or postman.there is a “REST Wrapper” project out there, but learning that was even needed was … funI don&#x27;t mind it, we found other ways to testOut of curiosity, how do you add a memcache to tRPC if you dont want to write directly to the prisma database reply JCharante 11 hours agorootparentI use trpc playground. It takes a few lines to setup. reply vendiddy 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are libs like ts-rest which I found to be less magical and easier to test. reply jitl 22 hours agoprevWe’ve use an API style similar to tRPC at Notion, although our API predated tRPC by 4 years or so.You can build this kind of thing yourself easily using Typescript’s mapped types, by building an object type where the keys are your API names, and the values are { request, response } types. Structure your “server” bits to define each API handler as a function taking APIs[“addUser”][“request”] and returning Promise. Then build a client that exposes each API as an async function with those same args and return type.We use this strategy for our HTTPS internal API (transport over POST w&#x2F; JSON bodies), real-time APIs (transport over Websockets), ElectronWebview APIs (transport over electron IPC), and Native (iOS, Android)Webview APIs (transport over OS webview ipc).For native APIs, the “server” side of things is Swift or Kotlin, and in those cases we rewrite the request and response types from Typescript by hand. I’m sure at some point we’ll switch to a binary based format with its own IDL, but for a single cross-language API that grows slowly the developer experience overhead of Protobuf or similar hasn’t seemed worth it. reply purkka 21 hours agoparentIn our current project with a TS frontend and Python backend, we use an OpenAPI schema as the source of truth and openapi-typescript-codegen [0] to interface with it on the client side. While not perfect, it provides a very nice interface to our API with request&#x2F;response typings.I also wrote a 10-line mock API wrapper that you can call as mockApi((request) => response), and it will type-check that your mock function implements the API correctly and return a function that looks exactly like the real API function.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ferdikoomen&#x2F;openapi-typescript-codegen reply iansinnott 21 hours agorootparentCan second this approach. At a past job we did the same, except to connect the frontend to a Go backend.I really like that the openAPI approach is language agnostic, and makes it relatively simple to support SDKs for many other languages if needed. For any company where the API itself is a product, OpenAPI is great. reply nerdponx 21 hours agorootparentWe use OpenAPI internally for communication between systems. It eliminates an entire category of bugs, and we can offload testing of schema conformance entirely to third-party tools. We&#x27;ve never had a bug due to a mistake in calling an internal API that I know of. And we get both internal documentation and a web UI for free via SwaggerUI and Redoc.Good zero-config OpenAPI support is one of the best features of the FastAPI framework in Python. The \"fast\" part refers to the speed of basic product up and running. reply Cannabat 10 hours agorootparentprevAnother great library to generate TS types from OpenAPI is https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;drwpow&#x2F;openapi-typescript . It provides the types as single objects you access via indexing, which is pretty nice. There&#x27;s a partner library to generate a typed fetch client. reply scottmas 16 hours agoparentprevThis is the way. tRPC adds unnecessary complexity over simply inferring types. My theory is that no well maintained and promoted library adopting this approach has emerged, and that’s why you don’t see it discussed very often. reply scriptsmith 22 hours agoparentprevIs there some trick to doing validation of request data using this process? That&#x27;s a valuable part of using something like tRPC, JSON Schema + type generation, zod, etc. reply jitl 21 hours agorootparentWe use an internal validator library that we infer request types from. It’s similar to Zod (but also predates it by a year).I’ve also spent some time on a Typescript type to X compiler. My first prototype is open source and targets Thrift, Proto3, Python, and JSON schema: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;justjake&#x2F;ts-simple-type&#x2F;tree&#x2F;main&#x2F;src&#x2F;com...I’m not happy with the design decision in that codebase to try to “simplify” Typescript types before compiling, and probably won’t continue that implementation, but we have a few internal code generators that consume TS types and output test data builders and model clases we use in production.I want to open source some of those bits but haven’t found the time. reply chaos_emergent 21 hours agorootparentprevDeepkit is a fantastic solution for this. It uses a compilation step to inject metadata about types into plain JS.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepkit.io&#x2F; reply jitl 20 hours agorootparentDeepkit looks really cool, but it’s so complex on the inside and leverages a forked&#x2F;patched Typescript and requires full typecheck before emit.What happens if the Deepkit guy retires? What if I want to run my code without waiting for 11 minutes of typechecking? What if there’s a bug somewhere in there?There’s way too much risk for me to consider Deepkit for production. reply danvk 13 hours agoparentprevI built something that sounds very similar at my last company called crosswalk.

Everyone seems to love it, and when combined with Zod it allows us to iterate super quickly as we pretty much only have to think about business logic as schema properties can easily be shared. though my favourite feature is zod transforms, meaning a iso date string can be validated and transformed into a DateTime object before it gets to the business logic.also it means we can remove the npm library of types that was previously used to sync types between FE&#x2F;BE (for this reason alone i love it really)I found the Docs somewhat lacking when i was trying to get the first project going but now I&#x27;ve used it for 6 months and i don&#x27;t need to look at the docs it&#x27;s been great.

It&#x27;s amazing how it pushed TypeScript only stacks to the limit in terms of DX. Additionally, it made the GraphQL community aware of the limitations and tradeoffs of the Query language. At the same time, I think tRPC went through a really fast hype cycle and it doesn&#x27;t look like we&#x27;re seeing a massive move away from REST and GraphQL to RPC. That said, we see a lot of interest in RPC these days as we&#x27;ve adopted some ideas from tRPC and the old NextJS. In our BFF framework (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wundergraph.com&#x2F;) we&#x27;ve combined file based routing with RPC. In addition to tRPC, we&#x27;re automatically generating a JSON Schema for each operation and an OpenAPI spec for the whole set of operations. People quite like this approach because you can easily share a set of RPC endpoints as an OpenAPI spec or postman collection. In addition, there are no discussions around HTTP verbs and such, there&#x27;s only really queries, mutations and subscriptions. I&#x27;m curious what other people&#x27;s experiences are with GraphQL, REST and RPC style APIs? What are you using these days and how many people&#x2F;teams are involved&#x2F;using your apis? reply c-hendricks 20 hours agoparent> it made the GraphQL community aware of the limitations and tradeoffs of the Query languageCould you expand on that? Our graphql types are generated from our federated schema whenever it changes, and response types for queries &#x2F; mutations are generated whenever you save a file. reply jensneuse 20 hours agorootparentWith tRPC and similar frameworks, you infer client types from server definitions without including actual server code into the client. As much as I like GraphQL, one thing that IDEs really suck at is recognizing when generated code changes. E.g. with Jetbrains IDEs it sometimes takes forever until a change to the generated code is actually picked up by intellisense. VSCode is a little bit better regarding this. When you infer types in tRPC style, this whole problem is gone. You can even jump between the client usage and the server implementation. That said, this is not without a cost. Large Typescript codebases can slow down the typescript autocompletion and this approach only works best when both client and server are written in typescript and ideally in the same codebase. reply c-hendricks 19 hours agorootparentHm, yeah I don&#x27;t think we had similar experiences with GraphQL then> you infer client types from server definitions without including actual server code into the clientOur types are generated into their own package, so there&#x27;s no chance of importing server code. reply cjblomqvist 19 hours agoparentprevThe thing that always strikes me is that verbs and paths are pretty tiny details (and also easy to abstract away using endpoint consumer generation libs) - then what else do you really get compared to your normal average web api?

When they&#x27;re introduced, no clients or servers know about them. Clients and servers aren&#x27;t restarted all at once. They won&#x27;t have the same version of the types. Data will be written using one version of a type and read using a different version.If you can guarantee all binaries, running programs, and data gets upgraded (no persistent data exists) then it might not be a problem. As soon as you have multiple organizations involved, guaranteeing all apps and servers sync to the latest version of a library, rebuild, and redeploy will be difficult.Static type checking assumes no version skew. All the code in the binary got built with the same version of the library defining the types.

Most people for whom TypeScript is an option won&#x27;t have been exposed to generations of RPCs that fail to deliver simplicity. So it isn&#x27;t going to be on their radar.I&#x27;ve been using gRPC and REST&#x27;ish+JSON APIs for years now and what I find puzzling is that REST+JSON tends to mean a lot more work, less pleasing code than gRPC, and yet people prefer it. Not because it leads to simpler, better, faster less error prone code (it doesn&#x27;t. Quite the opposite), but, I think, because people feel they can understand it.The people over at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buf.build have been doing a great job trying to tame gRPC btw. The protoc toolchain from Google has been uniquely horrible to work with, but the &#x27;buf&#x27; tool from said company has been a real life-saver. Not to mention their Buf Schema Registry, which admittedly I have only used on a few projects so far, but should migrate more projects to.Though in general, I feel that RPC mechanisms that are too closely tied to a given language are a waste of time.

People have overused it, and it&#x27;s not even compatible between some python releases. There are many other examples - where something works really neat, but only for that language, or even that language major or even just minor release.There is protobuf, cap&#x27;n&#x27;proto, flat buffers, fidl, thrift, etc. - many better choices than just one that works only for your language. reply wruza 16 hours agorootparentprevI agree that sticking to just a library may be not a good choice. Some standard would be better. But few last times I discussed it, some folks just slapped RPC stigma on everything, even if it was just your regular REST-y-ish calls underneath. That’s absurd. POST json receive json back is okay. Wrap it into an `await server.()` call and now it’s an RPC mudball. The current top commenter is removing tRPC for tight coupling. I wonder what prevents them from tight coupling over http, or over just function calls when on the same “side”. It’s a mindset that they are removing, not a specific technology. reply makeitdouble 18 hours agorootparentprevPeople sticking with REST+Json usually don&#x27;t want to have a compilation step for the API exchanges layer. That means more validation and worse tooling, but also better legacy and potentially future compatibility, and way easier debugging at any stage.I feel this is the same debate between scripting languages and compiled languages, both provide different trade-offs and I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll see one completely disappear at any point in time. reply spion 20 hours agoprevSo what do you do when you decide that you don&#x27;t want to use JavaScript anymore on either side of tRPC? (switch to something else on the server, or write a native mobile app, etc) reply zukzuk 20 hours agoparentUse TypeScript instead? (semi-joking)The way I&#x27;ve been approaching this lately is TypeScript on the frontend, then a thing TypeScript layer on the backend (via Deno), with those two pieces connected with tRPC. The real backend guts are in Rust (or whatever), and the backend tRPC layer talks to the Rust stuff with gRPC.So something like this: [(TS web client)(TS thin backend)](Rust service)This is a bit awkward, but honestly worth it for what you get with tRPC. One thing that took some getting used to is with tRPC the line between \"client\" and \"server\" gets blurry, which makes me uncomfortable for all sorts of reasons but in practice works well enough to make it not worth worrying about for now. reply spion 13 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m honestly pretty happy with TypeGraphQL. TypeGraphQL works code-first and lets you integrate request-scoped DI for resolvers, which makes writing more complex resolves significantly more pleasant.Admittedly for the web front end I couldn&#x27;t find a satisfactory tool so I built typed-graphql-builder (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;typed-graphql-builder.spion.dev&#x2F;). You do have to run it if your backend schema changes, but not when your queries change as the queries are written in typescript and inferred on the fly. (I should probably write a watch mode for the cli, that should largely take care of the rest of the toil when quickly prototyping) reply RadiozRadioz 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat&#x27;s the point of the middle layer? Seems like an extra step and a language change for no reason. Why not just expose HTTP from your Rust stuff? reply zukzuk 15 hours agorootparentBecause you lose all the stuff that’s nice about tRPC.The experience of building a tRPC app is very different from building an app that talks to a traditional REST API. The front and back end with tRPC are very tightly bound. In a way the backend part of your tRPC app becomes the real consumer of your actual API. reply RadiozRadioz 9 hours agorootparentOkay. I see 3 main benefits of the tRPC experience.1. You don&#x27;t need to manually write HTTP routes on the server side.2. You don&#x27;t need to manually write request code on the client side.3. There&#x27;s a type contract between both.I don&#x27;t see how this \"thin server\" approach helps with any of these.1. You&#x27;re no longer writing HTTP routes, but instead you&#x27;re writing gRPC. You haven&#x27;t eliminated the work, you&#x27;ve just changed the technology. If you happen to be integrating with a pre-existing gRPC deployment, why re-invent the wheel with custom TS code instead of using one of the many gRPC->HTTP transcoders?2. Modern web frameworks have so many abstractions on this pattern that it&#x27;s a non-issue at this point.3. Your thin server is effectively a mapper from gRPC to HTTP endpoints. That&#x27;s the type of thing you can build a spec from. If you&#x27;ve used a transcoder and have a spec, you can codegen your client library with the correct types.I think tRPC works best for making highly cohesive full stack apps. Using it as a middleman for your backend seems weird to me. reply nprateem 17 hours agorootparentprevWhy not just expose grpc via grpc-web with the envoy proxy? reply ssijak 17 hours agoparentprevThere are more important problems to solve when trying to boot up a self-sustaining startup or project than rewriting your app in a different technology for no apparent reason. reply spion 15 hours agorootparentThere are very good reasons to go native for a mobile app. React-native can be a huge time sink depending on what you want to do with the app. reply blascsi 21 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve just started using tRPC, and I&#x27;m in love with it so far!

If people actively used IDL today, there would probably be a lot of demand for a JSON variant or subset.I&#x27;d make similar arguments about using JSON vs S-expressions for data interchange, but JSON works well with both Javascript and HTTP and everyone standardized on those, and maps cleanly to basic data structures in just about every modern programming language.These JSON-based tools are actually very much like Lisp in that both the interface specification and the data are expressed in exactly the same format&#x2F;language. This is not true of a lot of these older standards, and seems to have been the failed promise of XML.IDL does look like it maps nicely to typed function calls in most languages, but it lacks the advantage of being expressed in a standard format&#x2F;language that is already well-supported for other tasks, and seemingly doesn&#x27;t impose any requirements on how the data itself is transmitted.For an example of why language&#x2F;format matters, consider the tool c2ffi (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rpav&#x2F;c2ffi). It generates a JSON description of a C header file. The header file itself is a pain to parse and extract information from. But once you have a tool to do it and put that information in a standard format, you can now build an FFI wrapper in just about any other language in at least semi-automated fashion. It makes the easy parts easier, compared to other systems like SWIG and GObject where the interface format is totally custom and you&#x27;re mostly reliant on a single implementation to make it all work.If anything, let&#x27;s be grateful that the good ideas of the past are being rediscovered and reinvented in a way that might grant them more longevity and broad usefulness than they had in their first life. Did you use IDL? What was your experience like? How would you compare it to something like gRPC? reply wrs 16 hours agorootparentThat’s an interesting statement, because from my vantage point “longevity” seems to be way, way down the priority list for pretty much any technology in JavaScript world. (The major exception being pure JSON.) It feels like if you open any JS codebase from more than 18 months ago, half the libraries will be deprecated or abandoned (not just the version, the entire library). Major patterns and frameworks reinvent themselves incompatibly on a biannual basis.The purpose of an RPC IDL (protobuf being a “modern” example) is that you define the interface and encoding in a way that will still be functional when your “standard language” is long forgotten or unrecognizably different. reply pjmlp 18 hours agorootparentprevOnly obscure to developers living in the present, without caring about learning where we come from, or presenting novel ideas without proper research.Android Binder, XPC, COM and gRPC are yet again another set of IDL quite present in current times.JSON? I thought everyone was using YAML now. &#x2F;s replyaustin-cheney 22 hours agoprevI am up voting this because its a good idea and you have really nice web site.I wrapped up something like this myself a few weeks ago, so I am in a position to offer some suggestions other people may not think about.The most common mistake I see with RPC, especially WebSockets, using Node.js is that they must be based off of HTTP. My attempt is based upon WebSockets, RFC 6455, where RPC is a generic term for socket based communication streams not specified against any single frame definition scheme. Since these technologies are raw sockets that include their own conventions for handshakes, optional frame header definitions, and possible security conventions there is no need for HTTP. In the OSI model HTTP is layer 7 where TCP sockets are layer 4. In Node that means just using the net&#x2F;tls libraries opposed to the http based descendant libraries. Since, in Node, the http library descends from from the net library and https descends from tls which descends from net http always imposes overhead that TCP based sockets do not require.There are three benefits for executing a socket server over HTTP:1) You are only using port 4432) Simple and familiar implementation from Node3) HTTP 1.1 is session-less, which allows anonymous untrusted connections. That is how the web works, but its less ideal for a security focused implementation.The reasons to not do this include CPU cost. Running sockets over HTTP increases processing overhead which reduces the number of concurrent streams you can offer and substantially slows down processing of incoming frames. In order to reduce your execution to a single port without sacrificing performance you could run HTTP over your socket implementation which allows you to customize your approach to security, but that would also require writing your own HTTP libraries. reply littlecranky67 22 hours agoparentMy issue with websockets is, they are still being blocked in corporate proxies. I particualarly see this in banks or research-places, where sockets are blocked to prevent data leaking out of the network. reply austin-cheney 22 hours agorootparentI used to work at a giant bank.The reason they might be blocked by big banks is due to deep packet inspection. How that works is that the bank intercepts certificates on TLS socket establishment for normal web traffic so that the bank proxy becomes a formal \"main in the middle\". They do this to provide deep packet inspection on all encrypted traffic that goes out and comes in. That level of packet inspection is more challenging with something like RPC&#x2F;WebSockets because its a binary stream, where HTTP just uses plain text for its header data.I can remember using Reddit, when I still used Reddit, when starting at the bank and I remember Reddit making heavy use of WebSockets that worked just fine from within the bank even though I was behind the bank&#x27;s proxy. This was more than 6 years ago, but I believe the WebSocket traffic at that mega bank was just relayed through proxy just like the HTTP traffic and I also want to say Reddit served the WebSocket traffic different from the HTTP traffic, but I cannot remember for sure. reply bluocms 22 hours agoparentprevYou can design to be transport agnostic. Then add various transport types: sockets, http, in memory (for testing)… reply austin-cheney 19 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that is correct. HTTP is managed by applications, but TCP packets are managed in the OS kernel. That distinction determines your options of approach and how things interact when parsing transport negotiation mechanisms. reply igeligel_dev 18 hours agoprevLove tRPC.

It looks like it uses JSON-RPC under the hood with strings for message names etc. I&#x27;m looking for ways to improve the throughput of an embedded WS server. One idea I had was for clients to negotiate a number-based encoding for these parts to reduce all unnecessary traffic. Is there any way to implement this with tRPC? reply chaosite 21 hours agoparentWhy not just gzip the data?It might not beat a bespoke hand-crafted protocol that minimizes message size, but your use of the word \"negotiate\" makes me think that that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re taking about... reply Timon3 21 hours agorootparentThe embedded device the server is running on has a very weak CPU. Since I&#x27;m trying to optimize throughput this would have quite an impact. It&#x27;s fine if the first few messages are slow, the speed just has to pick up after initialization is done, which is why negotiation is okay for me. So e.g. the client requesting IDs for every method on first connection would be fine, and would keep complexity down. reply marksomnian 18 hours agorootparentI imagine you could write a custom tRPC link to send the data over something like MQTT which may be better for an embedded client - there&#x27;s prior art in the likes of electron-trpc, showing how tRPC could be adapted to non-HTTP transports. Not sure how that interacts with the JSON-RPC bits of the subscription protocol though, if there&#x27;s no way around it then plain MQTT may be better suited to your use case. reply Timon3 18 hours agorootparentThank you for the suggestions! I am specifically looking to optimize frontend-to-server communication, so WebSocket is a must. Is there some way I could inject a custom transform function between TRPC and the WebSocket? I could copy the existing WebSocket link and add my transform in there, but it would of course be easier if I could just do my own wire handling with the existing code.Essentially I&#x27;d like to inject a custom respond[0] encoder and a custom parseMessage[1] decoder, and same for the client.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trpc&#x2F;trpc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;server&#x2F;src&#x2F;a...[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trpc&#x2F;trpc&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;packages&#x2F;server&#x2F;src&#x2F;a... reply Timon3 15 hours agorootparentUpdate: I was able to get this working by wrapping WebSocket and WebSocketServer! The API surface for the wrapper seems to be pretty minimal.

I love TypeScript, but for various reasons one may need a different backend language on the server side. Yes, OpenAPI is a thing, but I have yet to see an OpenAPI spec + code generator that works out of the box and doesn&#x27;t need a whole lot of fiddling and workarounds. I also understand that it&#x27;s hard to create something truly interoperable, my previous job was building a usecase-specific typing system, but adding yet more single-language ?RPC implementations isn&#x27;t really helping. Obligatory XKCD reference: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;927&#x2F; reply marksomnian 18 hours agoparentI think part of why tRPC shines is because it&#x27;s tightly coupled to TypeScript (and especially Zod, its schema validation library of choice - many of its features map 1:1 onto TypeScript concepts that don&#x27;t exist in many other languages), which means it can avoid many of the issues that OpenAPI generators have. I&#x27;d also like to see a good TS-first OpenAPI client - Fern [0] is probably the closest I&#x27;ve seen.In general in my experience, when you take away the constraint of inter-language interop, you get much smoother DX because you can take advantage of language features. A good example would be the lack of native date&#x2F;time types in JSON - valuable for interop because different languages handle dates differently, but painful when you&#x27;re going to&#x2F;from the same language. Web applications are a special case, because the client-side is effectively constrained to either JavaScript or WebAssembly (except you&#x27;d still need at least some JS in the latter case), so it follows that you&#x27;ll get the best DX if you have JS or TS on both sides of the stack, especially if you can set up your project in a way that lets you share code between both. Not always an option, but I&#x27;ve always felt more productive (as a full-stack dev) when I&#x27;ve been using TS on both the client and server, compared to TS on the client and another language on the backend.[0]: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildwithfern.com&#x2F; reply dsinghvi 18 hours agorootparent:wave: Hey Mark -- I&#x27;m one of the primary contributors to Fern.+1 to your comment about how needing to support multiple languages results in not being able to leverage certain language specific features.

The beauty of tRPC is that the types are derived&#x2F;inferred from the backend runtime code (like, as you type). It would be nigh impossible to do that with grpc(-web) using proto files as the source of truth.It&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s a project out there which could automatically produce proto files from something like zod, json-schema, etc. which could be directly interpreted by TS to provide similar (as you type) DX while still allowing some other language backend to consume the derived proto files (though the DX there would be less than ideal).If you&#x27;re just looking for similar TS clients&#x2F;interfaces for grpc-web then I&#x27;d recommend https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timostamm&#x2F;protobuf-ts which operates on plain JS objects (no new MyMessage().serialize(), instead the code generator mostly produces TS interfaces for you to work against: const myMessage: MyMessage = pojoConformingToInterface; const binary = MyMessage.toBinary(myMessage);) reply candiodari 19 hours agoprevCan I just say ... sigh ...

    "originBody": "UGU.RS About Blog Contact me Auditory illusions with examples from Daft Punk Listening to Daft Punk every now and then is a never aging event for me. Their albums have a variety of musical diversity, and you can always enjoy their fairly repetitive songs on boring household activities. ‘One more time, we’re gonna celebrateh! Oh yeah, Don’t stop the washing!’ Well, one of the most influential electronic duos of the millennium had plenty of tricks in their bag to put into their music. Today, I will try to introduce three of them with examples. What is Psychoacoustics? Psychoacoustics is an area that includes sound perception and audiology. The area studies psychological responses to auditory events, and the field is as extensive as acoustics, psychology, sound and electronic engineering, physics, and biology. The human auditory system is a complex system that starts from our pinna (your visible ear) and continues to the ear canal, membrane, auditory ossicles, cochlea, lateral superior olive, and medial superior olivary and travels in your brain to hear what is vibrating over the air. Everything we experience has a processing time of milliseconds. Perhaps that shows how fast and strong the human brain is. Although we have such a capable auditory system, scientists have shown that our perception may play some tricks when it comes to audio recognition. And by that, I don’t mean the physical mechanism but psychologically induced ones. Those findings show that hearing is also cultural; different cultures may hear differently. Continuity Effect & Phonemic restoration effect If a sound is interrupted by a noise with enough loudness in a short interval, we tend to hear the sound continuously. One can create gaps less than 200ms in a tone and fill those gaps with a particular noise which will hide the gaps for you. The shortness of duration combined with the noise, our brains tend to hear a continuous sound signal. Phonemic restoration slightly differs from the continuity effect. This time our brain “fills” the gaps of missing sounds. Our brain acts meddlesome in favor of increased intelligibility, even though the sound lacks information. We observe this phenomenon in the popular Daft Punk song: “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” If you start listening around 2:20, you will experience the various cuts. (most noticeable around 2:50) The Octave Illusion (Deutsch’s Octave Illusion) The Octave Illusion is one of the most interesting psychoacoustic illusions, first discovered by Diana Deutsch in 1973. The illusion works as follows: Two tones, one with higher and one with lower pitch, play in our ears in an alternating fashion visualized as follows: There is one octave between the tones. If the alternation is short enough, you will hear the higher tone in one ear and the lower in the other. Your handedness plays a role here. Right-handed people tend to hear the higher pitch in the right ear. If you are left-handed or ambidexter your perception may vary. For this illusion, our example comes from the Discovery album. Open the song Aerodynamic and fast-forward to 2:28, start listening to the passage. I hear the higher pitch on my right and the lower one on my left ear. What about you? Talking Piano This effect is the art of making the piano (or another instrument) speak! There are a number of examples of it, where people approximate human speech by converting it into fundamental frequencies and then playing the piano notes to reconstruct the atomic structures of speech. An interesting example you can find is here. Even though the effect is named a talking piano, other instruments can speak as well. In their song “Robot Rock”, you can hear the guitar chords talking, as if they are singing the lyrics, ehm, Robot Rock! Conclusion There are more than three auditory illusions to present (maybe more than 40) and Daft Punk may have created songs including those illusions. It is evident that hearing is not just physical but also psychological. Speaking of psychology, does anyone know how do our feelings connect to music? Listening to Instant Crush, Veridis Quo, or Something About Us, you will most likely fall into a brown study. That is a phenomenon I can’t explain myself either.

The high tone clearly moves between sides.Maybe worth mentioning: I&#x27;ve had a hearing test in the past year and I&#x27;m essentially completely balanced, so there likely isn&#x27;t a tone-deafness issue on one side that could cause a reception imbalance. Could the illusion just be hearing damage? And then handedness just follows which ear takes more damage due to more noisy things happening &#x2F; less protection on that side? That could also explain why left-handed people are less strongly sided, as they&#x27;re forced to do things more balanced due to right-hand-only stuff existing. reply gizajob 13 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s the Shepard tone effect running in the background of the actual notes, which produce a mild illusion that they&#x27;re ascending when they&#x27;re not, but nevertheless they&#x27;re moving up and then down in pitches so it&#x27;s not a brilliant example. I think the author is a little confused in this short essay about a few things. His \"talking piano\" effect is just standard vocoding, which has made me think this is all fairly new to him and he&#x27;s not an expert.THIS is a talking piano: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;muCPjK4nGY4 reply squeaky-clean 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure the blog author is referring to 2 hard panned synths, the sort of plucky one in the right and more smooth one on the left. There&#x27;s also a 3rd more \"nasal\" synth voice in the center which is playing the same pattern with the high&#x2F;low notes inverted except for the quicker 4 note run that happens on the 4th count of every bar, where it synchronizes again. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s octave effect, but it produces a similar result and all 3 synths seem to occupy their own separate frequency space while also sounding like one unit.This article has a decent recreation of the left and right synths in Aerodynamic. It does not include the center sound though.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reverbmachine.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;daft-punk-discovery-synth-sou...There is no shephard tone running in the background, that&#x27;s a phaser effect running over an otherwise plain pad playing chords.You can hear from 2:52 to 2:55 it&#x27;s descending and from 2:56 to 2:59 it&#x27;s rising. Descending again at 3:00 to 3:03 and etc.Here&#x27;s a video of someone replicating that phaser fx tone very well. Though they use it in the guitar solo.

It&#x27;s not, and when you dig, you can tell it&#x27;s not, but when you&#x27;re casually listening, your brain here&#x27;s a \"fuller\" note for some reason.

The illusion in the post and on the Wikipedia page involves changing the tone only four times per second, there&#x27;s no claims at all about both tones blending together or producing only a single note.Both are quite clear about different ears hearing different things, and hearing two or more tones. reply gabereiser 10 hours agorootparentI’m referring to the perceived sounds. They aren’t blended together. I’m fully aware of what vibrato is and what the post is talking about in terms of changing tone, half tones, auditory phantoms, trichords, and the octave illusion. The Wikipedia page details the phenomenon with stepping and alternating but it’s not the end of it. Various intervals have been tested. Us musicians have been playing with this for a while now. reply Groxx 10 hours agorootparentThis whole thread is about the octave illusion, which is a very specific subset of psychoacoustics, and AFAICT the post accurately summarizes it as:>There is one octave between the tones. If the alternation is short enough, you will hear the higher tone in one ear and the lower in the other.No changes. Handedness of sounds that already exist. replyilyt 11 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t hear that. I hear constant low tone in both ears with only high one bouncing around (i.e the ear where high is is perceiving low one even if it is not there) reply Groxx 11 hours agorootparentWith the Wikipedia sample, I kinda suspect the central low note is the same phenomenon as binaural beats - 400hz and 800hz constructively interfere to produce 400hz. There is no 400hz on the high side, but we perceive interference even though there is none.Which means it should disappear or produce a third tone if it wasn&#x27;t an exact doubling.

Most common one for me is when you&#x27;re making a patch on a synth and by chance dial in those frequencies that align with formants (similar to the Robot Rock effect the post mentions).Yesterday I was working on a bass drum beat, and after adding some synths playing on top of it, I started to hear the bass drum echo. So, my first thought was I had accidentally enabled some kind of reverb or echo effect on it while I was setting up the synths. After confirming I hadn&#x27;t and isolated the track to ensure the bass drum was sounding as intended, I chalked it up to some weird illusion between the synths and drum that was making it sound like an echo. I know it&#x27;s not there in reality, but I can&#x27;t unhear it.In this case, I went back and added a little echo to the drum to make the effect intentional, which turned out to sound good, but sometimes I&#x27;ll try to make the illusion reality and it doesn&#x27;t have the same effect. reply metamet 11 hours agorootparentI always wonder if it&#x27;s some odd thing going on in the DAW.Would you be willing to export that track as two tracks--one with drums and one with synth?

Music production is all about creating a \"space\" and a lot of what producers do is create the illusions that sounds are coming from particular places, and that sound like they&#x27;re from a \"big\" source or whatever.A common thing to do is to pan a synth to one side, then add a very short (milliseconds) delay panned to the other side, which makes it sound like a very large sound played from a large distance away.Another is stacking up a bunch of oscillators that are slightly detuned from each other, which again, makes the sound \"big\", because it sounds like many sources playing together, rather than one source.Just using a \"reverb\" is generating an illusion of being in a large, echo-y space.I do think that most producers don&#x27;t really think of it as creating illusions, and more as making \"cool\" sounds. reply whiddershins 12 hours agoparentprevYes reply anArbitraryOne 11 hours agoprevWould someone please send him a tweet telling him that you can start videos specific timestamps on YouTube by adding \"&t=0s\" where 0 is the desired number of seconds to the URL?

If my recollection is correct, my troubles with the lower pitched sound is a little ironic because I play bass and often try to point out bass parts I like to my fiancee, but she sometimes has trouble parsing out exactly what I&#x27;m referring to due to not having had any musical training and it not being as obvious to her which part is the bass when I&#x27;m showing her a song with lots of different guitar and keyboard tracks and lots of heavy bass drum. reply Waterluvian 12 hours agoprevI’ll have to figure out which Daft Punk song I’m thinking of, but there was this segment where I swear there’s this really swingy chord progression but when slowed down to study it turns out to be the same chord repeated over and over.

The faint \"music\" could be tinnitus, some electric device (speakers, guitar amp, etc.) picking up an AM or shortwave radio station, or just your brain making up (or playing back) music as you drift off to sleep.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hypnic_jerkhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Exploding_head_syndrome reply samstave 8 hours agorootparentTHANK YOUHypnic jerk is my thing, and im male - and have all the halmarks such as chronic insomnia, but just started melatonin.But wow - yeah it scares the heck out of me, yet the wiki says \"benign\" so that is thankful...A morbid dark, intrusive thought that has happened to me when these occur is that my heart stopped due to sleep apnia and that I was startling myself back alive...however these occur even when I am not yet asleep and in twilight mode.-SIDS ;;This reminds me of what the believe the cause of SIDS to be: a pocket of co2 around the infants breathing-bubble where they are just recirculating the CO2.So, I wonder if the infants dont yet have the ability to startle themselves back awake... but adults do.I have had two people close to me who have had SDIS babies, and its horrifying.A small crib fan may prevent CO2 bubbles... reply jrmg 12 hours agoparentprevThe flash thing sounds like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Synesthesia reply IndySun 10 hours agoprev [–] \"...Their albums have a variety of musical diversity...\"I like Daft Punk, but I, and they, I&#x27;m sure, never described themselves as such.

Pointing this out in the slides gave me a sense of relief.Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t put names to every minor part of an algorithm or formula that was discovered to work empirically. But then again, I haven&#x27;t discovered anything, and the authors of the respective papers certainly deserve some credit for their inventions! reply chefandy 14 hours agoprevI find open educational resources just so dang heartwarming. reply junrushao1994 17 hours agoprevThis is a particular unique course offering introduction on ML compilation and deployment :) reply __rito__ 15 hours agoparentI really liked the style of the instructor (Kolter), and the reason I like this course very much is because each lecture is followed by an implementation video along with the notebook file.In most Deep Learning courses, the implementation is left to TAs and neither recorded nor made available. This course is an exception. Another bright exception is NYU Deep Learning course [0] by Yann LeCun and Alfredo Canziani. In that course, too, all recitations (\"Practica\") are recorded and made available.

What is a startup? Startups are designed to scale/grow rapidly. Startups utilize tech to do this. Startups can be non-tech companies that utilize tech. Startups are information era companies and they are creating the new best practices in business. /r/startups We share interesting discussions and stories about our startup journeys, both the failures, the successes, and the embarrassments. Our best traits are authenticity and integrity. Ask Someone Anything! We want to know who you want to ask anything! We are working on a consistent AMA schedule. Tell us who you want to interview in that thread. Flair Message the mods for instructions on how to get flair verifying your experience.

We want you to be able to link in discussion to relevant content. We also don't want the discussion to turn into a self promotional mess and link farm. If you are going to link to something in the comments please make sure to: Write at least a sentence explaining why the link is relevant to the discussion. Link only content you have no affiliation with. Affiliate links = banned. 6.Do Not Solicit PM Requests The purpose of making a submission or comment is to engage in a public discussion with the community. It is not to request a PM/DM from someone. You are more than welcome to engage privately with one another, but it is up to you to take the initiative directly. 7.Sharing Your Blog is To Start a Discussion Sharing your blog is not a means to self promote. A link to the original blog post is allowed with prior Mod approval.

No blogs about your \"startup\" journey allowed. 8.Always Be Kind and Supportive The goal of this community is to encourage people to learn and be inspired to pursue ventures related to startups. Do not troll, harass people, or be an asshole. This does not mean to lie. It means to give support and explain why you don't like something. Try to remember people likely do not have much experience yet or might be simply ignorant to what you know. Be willing to hold a discussion and try to explain your opinion or point of view to the benefit of the entire community. 9.No Unscheduled AMAs We do not allow unscheduled AMAs. We need to verify and approve all AMAs.

Too much survivor bias. Hopefully my story can give you another perspective. Quit my executive job at a FAANG. Started a SaaS as a first time founder. Raised a modest amount (under a million) and got to work alone. Hit a lot of roadblocks but figured things out until I found product market fit. Boy was that lonely. Everyone, and I mean everyone, told me it wouldn’t work. I hired a couple of people who were great but wouldn’t look good on a pitch deck. I didn’t care because I was heads down building, selling, and delivering the product. My small team was amazing. Then the VCs showed up. The same ones who wouldn’t take my call before are now reaching out. I ended up raising a lot of money. Way more than I needed. Biggest mistake I made but I’ll get to that later. The VC wanted me to grow faster and gave me impossible targets to hit. When I gently protested, he’d introduce me to founders in his portfolio to talk to and see how they did it. I realized later that those 2 founders were the only founders in his 100+ portfolio who hit those targets. More importantly, I’m his third biggest company! But he’d never give me a chance to feel that way because they’re in the business of making you work till you drop, not in celebrating your “great” success. They want the most success. Anyway, by then I had over $10m in the bank for a startup of 5 people making low 7 figures from well established and extremely happy customers. Things couldn’t be better. At least that’s what I think now I’m hindsight. The VCs want you to be a rocket ship. Being content with this is their worst situation because now you’d be paid well and doing what you love while they are waiting for you to cash out. If they don’t push you to hate this status quo, you’ll lose momentum and they’ll lose the bet. I hope this part is clear because it’s the crux of the misalignment between founders and VCs. Anyway, I was told to hire a lot of people. Put fuel on the fire they said. Bring industry experts who can move the needle. All this BS you hear all day. All failed. I hired VPs and bloated my payroll. Ultimately I ended up with a bunch of highly paid employees who don’t know how to do anything but to “build and lead amazing teams.” Imagine you hire someone to scale an area and their solution is to divide that area into 5 sub areas and hire someone for each of them to figure it out, etc. that’s their solution. Anyway, I ended up focusing my efforts on hiring and ramping up those VPs and dealing with their dumb ideas instead of focusing on my 3 core tenants: build, sell, and deliver. Now who suffered? My customers and my original employees. My customers started experiencing poor delivery and slow growth so they started to cancel. My original employees would complain to their new bosses but the new bosses would criticize how things had been done. All in all we went from $0 to $100m to $0 because I followed the advice of the VCs. Thanks for letting me share my story. 329 commentssharesavehidereport top 200 commentsshow all 329 sorted by: best Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment! CREATE AN ACCOUNT [–]N0m0m0 175 points 17 hours ago Something similar happened to me. I started a second company bootstrapped and couldn't be happier. Many lessons learned that you only gain through this humbling experience. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]elma3allem[S] 139 points 17 hours ago We should do an AMA permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]OwlGroundbreaking573 29 points 16 hours ago Please do, I'm taking some risks to build a hardware start up and would love insight. When I say risk, I mean relative to my means (which are very small) My main priority is bringing an excellent product to market, followed other products. The idea is solid, but will seem insanely ambitious to the average person and perhaps due to a lack of professional experience in either software engineering (which I understand well) and manufacturing engineering which I have only a rudimentary understanding of (2 years uni) I think investors will find me too risky. The hardware is game changing in a specific field. I will need to raise pre-seed money to build the MVP and protect IP, then inevitably require an investment to set up production... So I'm really fumbling in the dark and would like to hear real anecdotes of what others have done to resolve these issues. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]mrtomd 6 points 16 hours ago I am interested how hardware startups survive... My fear is that simple hardware is easily copied by China and doesn't produce recurring revenue, so investors are super careful. If you have good software on it - maybe yes... I would like to talk to like-minded people and share experiences. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]OwlGroundbreaking573 10 points 15 hours ago In this case I have some IP aspects I can protect. There is a very large software component (consumer SAAS) so not a one hit wonder, there will be reoccurring revenue and service. The software isn't clever or complicated, just something not done before, but with high implicit demand.There is a B2B version which can be protected and a B2C version which would be harder to protect (simpler, some quite similar prior art) My origins, the EU, UK seem far more strongly rooted in core technologies underpinning the hardware, so the Chinese could make it... They'd struggle to do it as cheaply and as well. It's an odd niche they don't dominate at all. Then factor in dumping duties and they'd struggle to follow. Whether I succeed or fail, I have to walk this road. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Just_Shallot_6755 5 points 14 hours ago We are able to patent the software itself because it is novel and useful enough. We’re expanding those then moving to accelerated hw. We have been told that we will need tons of HW IP in addition to the software patents. This is how patent portfolios are built. I think LG has a 5 patent bundle you need to license from them if you want do any 5G telecommunications stuff. They make a fortune in royalties. If you have good IP, you can earn money off of it in lots of fun and unexpected ways. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (2 replies) [–]alexxs88 4 points 14 hours ago I (co)started two companies selling hardware products (with software included). The answer is bootstrapping. In the end hardware is a few thousands per iteration, worst case. If you have someone at least vaguely competent at hardware design you should reach the sellable product stage within 2-3 iterations. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (2 replies) [–]Just_Shallot_6755 3 points 15 hours ago This is why we have a USPTO. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]OwlGroundbreaking573 2 points 15 hours ago True, EPO seem very thorough too. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) load more comments (2 replies) [+]DoctorDabadedoo 3 points 14 hours ago (1 child) load more comments (3 replies) [–]microthewave 6 points 13 hours ago Seconding, please do! This post was a great read. I’m similarly wary of VC’s after working in venture backed startups for ~7 years. Bootstrapping is the dream, but we’re so trained to pitch and fundraise. Would love to hear your process and lessons learned. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Informal_Practice_80 2 points 2 hours ago Corporate culture incentives people to \"lead\" and that's their definition of growth. But at the end of the day they don't know how to do anything. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (2 replies) [–]djodom 34 points 14 hours ago Similar here- So many lessons learned. SaaS company with a hardware product (even issued a patent on it). I ran a solo startup for five years, struggled to find that perfect co-founder. Raised $3M, came up to a $20M valuation then bloated my payroll with an industry juggernaut heavyweight as CEO, I became CTO. VCs wanted rapid growth, CEO turned out to be lazy, his prior success was due to his amazing team, not him. Ended up with a huge payroll, CEO failed to raise more capital, left us with no payroll. I ended up selling stock-for-stock and just exited with 10% of newco. They still owe me $100k. I hope it pays off some day. Took a year off, had to go to counselling and a lot of meditation to forgive those who wronged me and move on. If you guys do an AMA, let us all know. It would be great to hear more. Much respect to those who have taken the risk. 99% would never even try. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (2 replies) [–]wau2k 6 points 10 hours ago* I’m an LP in a bunch of funds and would probably bootstrap my next venture, which I did previously btw. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]weewooPE 113 points 17 hours ago Would you have turned down VC money if you can do it again? permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]elma3allem[S] 132 points 17 hours ago 100% permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]dpux comment score below threshold (15 children) load more comments (1 reply) [–]CBRIN13 50 points 14 hours ago* This is a big reason we’re seeing so many bootstrappers having great success since the downturn. People have realised there’s a different way of doing things. Maybe not the same scale but people have leverage a small team to build great products, entirely in public. Indie hackers and solopreneurs are learning from startups and applying the 'validated learning' feedback loop to their own products with great success. You see it all over Twitter now. For anyone out there wanting to start building a product - you don't have to raise!! Just start! Plenty of content for those starting down this path here. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]jcarlson2007 2 points 4 hours ago Subscribed, thanks. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) [–]meta4our 12 points 13 hours ago I'm an executive at a startup that's doing well (KP funded, out growth year is pushing us into comfortable 8 figures, hardtech). My job is hard. Hard on my mind, body, family. Have my first son on the way and I'm excited and scared of how I'm gonna balance it all. I hope we exit in ~2 years. I think we can, and if we exit well, it would be fully worth it. I can spend a few years being a dad and working part time helping others. I'm pretty sure I'll enter the startup world again, have too many ideas, but with the help of a successful exit, I plan on bootstrapping and taking on as little outside money or debt as possible. I don't care if progress is slow, as long as it's sustainable and rewarding. I'll be in my 40s by then, and it'll be the difference between an amazing job that is all consuming, that I can do for 4-6 years before burning out, and an amazing I you can do for longer while being a good father to my kids and a good husband to my wife. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (5 replies) [–]beambot 36 points 16 hours ago VC is a very specific asset class that is explicitly aiming for grand slam home runs. Portfolio theory says they're going to make 30 bets from each fund, and they need one of them to return 3x the fund in 7-10 years. That means they expect you to be a 100x or 0x. You should accept this fact eyes wide open when you take the money... permalinkembedsavereportreply [+]rgbhfg 2 points 7 hours ago (0 children) load more comments (1 reply) [–]anguyen52024 65 points 16 hours ago I was on the same boat 3 years ago. Got invested by one of the biggest names in VC and became the hottest one in my industry. It is an API product since I was a dev-turn-founder, and they suggested us to go to enterprise things to “leverage” their big portfolio. I disagree, then they persuaded my co-founder to push me out of the board. I quit and everything gone. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]elma3allem[S] 24 points 16 hours ago Much love friend. I hope you’re ok now. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]anguyen52024 8 points 9 hours ago Thanks mate! I am working on another gig. And this time will be bootstrapped. Hope you are doing well, too. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]PuzzleheadedBasis951 14 points 14 hours ago Did you cash out enough from it? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Joe_Doblow 8 points 12 hours ago EVERYTHING gone! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (3 replies) [–]Ok-Ratio-7872 35 points 15 hours ago Fellow b2b saas founder here - this right here is exactly why, after a few months of contemplation and asking myself if I’d be happy with investors involved, I’ve decided to build on my own. I’m completely self-funding the company and not dealing with VCs at all. I’m doing the development, initial sales and marketing, and all other tasks myself so I’ve barely spent anything other than the $1k I paid to the lawyer to set up the LLC/write an operating agreement/etc and $0.12 on a domain name after a discount. At this point and especially after reading your post, I’m convinced it’s much healthier to grow in response to profit and actual business happening and very carefully allocate capital versus chasing endless funding rounds. Thanks for sharing your story! permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]DrDJHansen 6 points 3 hours ago You should be convinced. Research shows this to be the case. And not just a small study - one with 650,000 firms. It shows that profit before growth is much more likely to lead to high growth and high profit. Pushing for growth first, which is what VCs demand, is far more likely to end poorly. Here's a summary of the study, if you're interested: https://research.qut.edu.au/ace/2022/03/18/is-grow-your-business-fast-at-all-cost-a-sound-strategy-massive-new-study-says-no/ permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Ok-Ratio-7872 2 points 3 hours ago Interesting, glad to hear my thought process/gut decision/“this just feels intellectually honest to run a business backed by actual profits” is validated by legitimate research. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [+]nocodethis 3 points 14 hours ago (7 children) [–]sir-algo 29 points 15 hours ago While this goes against the VC mantra a lot, coming from the bootstrapped world, my philosophy has always been that a small team has a significant competitive advantage over a larger team, and growing headcount is a last resort to increase delivery after you've exhausted all other reasonable options. When mentoring new managers and leaders, I always tell them that I want to hear ideas and solutions from them that don't involve hiring first. I never want a new manager to come to me and tell me they need to go hire 5 people to solve the problems with their team or org. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]elma3allem[S] 13 points 13 hours ago* Your advice is spot on. My VPs were all hired to figure things out and their solution was to hire directors to figure things out. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]comparingcrocodile 5 points 5 hours ago I would argue that that's what a VP job title is - they lead departments. If you wanted ICs, you should have hired ICs, not VPs. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Lopsided_Violinist69 4 points 4 hours ago That's because having many direct reports is what makes them a VP, it's a people leadership position. If you want actual work done, hire ICs and manage them yourself until you no longer can. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) [–]BillW87 5 points 7 hours ago 100%. We raised from very patient capital (high net worth/family office) who supported us in taking a lean growth approach. We've got a team of 8 at the corporate level overseeing operations of 12 (soon to be 16) locations. One of our VC-backed competitors just failed at 4 locations. They had a team of over 40 people. A smaller group of ass-kickers who take true ownership of their roles will 10 out of 10 times outperform a massively overbuilt team that struggles under its own logistical weight. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]Zeus473 20 points 13 hours ago SaaS startup I worked at took as little funding as possible and ran super lean. They were super fussy about who they let invest. When acquired, the co-founders sold their controlling share and walked away with 40 mil each on a 140m acquisition. Ok not huuuge numbers. Could they have gone bigger? Probably. But many founders who go big and have unicorn valuations etc will be lucky to have that kind of exit.

Most early stage startups don’t make it. There’s no point benchmarking yourself against the median company, because the median company doesn’t make it. If you raise VC you really need to be in it to be one of the top 1% of startups as that’s what it takes to build an IPOable startup. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]elma3allem[S] 87 points 17 hours ago You’re missing the point.

VCs want a 35x + exit in 3-5 years and won't invest unless you're over $5k/MRR, ideally $25k-$35k MRR. They're also quite loudly complaining about not having anywhere to put their money. They detest only making 5% to 11.5% on their money 🙄 It's the wildest time in my memory. Secondly, VCs have always believed that just because they did A or B or C, so can you, to get to the same valuation & exit - and they will push you and push you and push you. This is a rude awakening to anyone who comes from the FAANG or enterprise technology ranks. Unless you've been lucky to straddle both worlds, walking into a startup for the first time is an awakening. Still. Thanks for sharing your story.

I’m just curious permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]ig1 22 points 16 hours ago* I’ve done both sides of the table (+been an lp in several funds) It’s fine if you don’t want to share the specifics of what went wrong, but from my experience founders often miss the the underlying reasons for failure because they don’t have the broader benchmarking set (for example by far the biggest reason for failure is bad market which you only really see if you’ve seen the metrics of all the players in the space) Plenty of VCs do give bad advice and it certainly sounds like you had some mishires,but from what you said about being better than the average portfolio company it sounds like you might not have had a good benchmark for what an ipo track company looks like at your stage. It may be that your VC was being completely unrealistic, but it could also be what it took to be on IPO path and it just seemed unrealistic to you. Even if you’re a top-10% company the performance of a top-1% company may seem insane. It’s a very different dynamic from bootstrapped company which often founders don’t think about before deciding whether to bootstrap vs fundraise. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply [–]edzorg 5 points 12 hours ago This is a really interesting point, thanks permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply load more comments (1 reply) [–]syth9 0 points 3 hours ago There were 33 million startups in the US in 2022 and 181 IPOs.

Do better (I didn’t do any) due diligence They’re not my friends. If they’re not my enemy today, they will likely be tomorrow. They’ll definitely become my enemies when things don’t go their way. Set up the paperwork accordingly. Talk to my lawyers and share my concerns before they start writing docs. Don’t trust whatever they accept. It’s not their company so they can fuck it up for me. Be diligent. Never ever ever give up control. I know more about my business than anyone else in the world. I realized that too late. VCs don’t typically know much. They certainly don’t know as much as I do about my business. They’re wisdom they bestow on me at board meetings are based on distilled information I successfully conveyed to them during the last hour of board meeting while they were distracted looking at their phone or thinking about something else.

Many aren't quite legal, but are going to be a long hard litigation. Maybe worth it if the company turns into Apple, but if it gets bought out for 20 million, and your portion should have been 5 million, then good luck fighting it. Here's a simple example. You own 40% of company A, your \"partner\" owns 40%, and the VC has 20. They vote you off the island. But the VC also has a shitty mostly failed company post IPO (so it has a ticker symbol). They do a weird ass merger where you suddenly own 0.5% of the public company, they own 99%, and your partner owns 0.5%, but he was offered some kind of weird options package along with other not straight equity payments. They then do a pump and dump on the public company and if you are lucky you sell your shares for 50k. Your partner manages to end up with 5 million from bonuses, options, and equity, and the VC ends up with 80 million.

It just hands everything to the rich, and almost every aspect of it is detrimental to the consumer and to the economy You haven’t mentioned the way compensation and get-out clauses are organised either, because you were one of the successful ones that didn’t need it. Everything is stacked in favour of people with money and almost everything they touch, they ruin. I never met an investor who had actual skill or expertise or creativity above the founders. They just live life on parasite mode. It took a few years but I was disgusted by the industry and now I couldn’t be less capitalist. I certainly don’t subscribe to the ‘capitalism is great for innovation’ mantra, it’s terrible for it You learned the hard way, if you don’t need capital as an essential immediate step (which most companies don’t, at any point), don’t do it.

And not just any capital but Massive Amounts of Capital. They want to buy champions and they have the means to do it. Unfortunately that means that second place in the tournament isn't a team who won almost everything they played with a pool of amazing talent that created amazing results -- they're the first loser in VC land. If the whole capitalistic system worked the way VCs worked, nothing would ever be created because they have the means to ignore the necessary process and just care about the results. It reminds me of a famous investor that said just the other week that he only invests in teams that have a proven track record and that's what everyone else should do, too. Well...that really doesn't work if /everyone/ does it. People have to step on the track the first time sometimes.

We were born in the austerity, VCs recently adopted it. There will be a cohort of bootstrapped companies that started in 2021 and didn’t take money when times were good. Bootstrapping a startup SUCKS. But, you learn a lot about how to switch between strategy/vision vs tactical get shit done business mode. It teaches you to be a business person who is living in cold business reality. You learn the value of relationships, actionable business intelligence, and get a sense for how people really are. This cohort of founders will have just clawed their way through the hardest startup environment in memory and they really won’t be interested in high minded advice from patagonia bevested VCs who just got in from fresh manicure appointment. Things are changing, founders see what’s going on and where opportunities are because we are literally living it. VCs treat founders like idiots, and the sad thing is that it often works.

The money isn't free, it's in exchange for equity, and so you should maximize the value received. The VC didn't control you, or if they did, it's because you gave them control. Why give up control to someone with misaligned interest and unknown capability? You only hire or spend in order to maximize return on investment. Every hire serves a specific purpose for turning profits in the medium term (not the long term, because if you are losing money, you don't have long term). 5 people certainly shouldn't raise $10 million at once - that implies that you are going to 10x your number of employees in a short time, and there's no way to do that efficiently. You should have created a budget for the next 12 - 24 months and raised that much and no more. What it comes down to is have a frugal mindset. Do not spend equity, control, or money without an identifiable large near-term return on investment. If you do, you are throwing away the potential of your company. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]DismalAssistance1736 2 points 12 hours ago You seem to put a lot of blame on hiring useless execs, but I’d argue you failed at hiring the “right” execs.

You sound like you may still be processing - I hope you take some time for yourself. I went into therapy for a while and took a 6 month sabbatical. It feels though there's still quite a bit missing from this story to pull the real learnings here. In general I disagree with a lot of the sentiment of this thread. VC money has nothing inherently bad about it, it's simply a tool we can choose to utilize, and a decision on what game we want to play. There are good and bad actors in every industry. Good and bad people to work with. If you take any VC money, it's expected there to be a certain return. That requires growing fast, and the math will say exactly how fast you need to grow. This is not toxic, it's just economics. There is no misalignment between VCs and founders. If you buy into the game, you should be aligned that you are playing by that ruleset. It's not their job to make you feel good about yourself. It's their job to make sure you are going to make them a return. They have to answer to other people too. If your company is not ready to take on fast growth, either you take the money, hire, and hope you figure it out as you scale (build the ship as you sail - very common), or you should NOT take the money yet and get more prepared (the slow and steady way). I'm a little confused by the investor / founder dynamic here. You own the company. You are making operational decisions. It's easy to get bullied by strong people, but that's also kinda your job as CEO is to be the strong, determined leader that steers the ship and fends off attacks. Investors always push, but just calmly and kindly tell them your plan and ignore. Your plan still has to be to be fast growth, or a plan to get back to fast growth ASAP. If you sold too much of the company and didn't actually have the power to run the company anymore - then that's the real takeaway here. Wrong investors, wrong deal. Then there's the situation with hiring. You hired the wrong people. This has nothing to do with the investor advice. They didn't tell you to hire useless middle managers (did they?). It's still up to you to figure out how to hire and scale - at what cadence, who, and what type of culture you run. You could also fire the people that weren't working and correct course. It sounds like that didn't happen. Everyone hires the wrong people sometimes. Letting it burn all your cash before taking action is an execution issue on your side. It sucks taking all responsibility, but that's also what's awesome about doing a startup. I hope you can take a more nuanced approach at looking at what happened. There will be a lot of amazing learnings waiting for you. I hope you try again. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]izybit 2 points 9 hours ago VCs will fund 100 startups and they know 90-99 of the them will fail miserably so they bet that the rest will return 100x-1000x. That's why they don't actually care about slow and steady growth as they can't survive that long without a good exit/IPO every so often. Angel investors are more geared towards those types of businesses as they have a different mentality. Also, not all VCs are the same and even within the same VC not all people are the same. Lots of stories on Twitter/X about those dynamics. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]paulatsydney 2 points 8 hours ago I am new to startup space. One question always in my mind: what if you don’t take money from VC? See, you have product market fit, you gain profits from happy customers, you took money because you want to scale up to something big. What if we are satisfied with our small success business, what will it end up? Imagine 100 years ago, there is no VC or incubation, still there are success businesses. permalinkembedsavereportreply [+]captain_DA 2 points 5 hours ago (0 children) [–]RingLeader2021 2 points 6 hours ago Raise a seed round in a SAFE. Build sell build sell. Repeat. When the VCs come say “maybe” and don’t return their emails. Get the company profitable and exit, keeping most of the money. And you sell when YOU want (most founders don’t know when they accept VC they don’t control their destiny anymore). After you exit you will likely see 98% of your colleagues who raised tens of millions and thought they were going to be the next Chesky cry. On Reddit.

The worst of them were led by people who list things like \"organization design\" and \"build and lead amazing teams\" on their LinkedIn.At the most dysfunctional company, the ex-FAANG CTO would take key job descriptions and add the requirement that they must have FAANG experience. This created a glass ceiling where the early employees, non of whom had FAANG backgrounds, were unable to be promoted. Instead, we got a lot of ex-FAANG VPs and Directors who didn&#x27;t know how to function at a startup. They were told to lead teams of people who knew the business inside and out (because they built it!) yet they could barely function outside of a big company themselves. Every meeting would be a competition of stories about \"At Microsoft we did this...\" or \"At Facebook we did that...\" because playing the FAANG card was the only thing the CTO liked to hear.The only non-FAANG person who thrived at that company was the single worst leader I&#x27;ve ever reported to. He is a LinkedIn influencer with his own newsletter where he talks about, among other things, his expertise in \"Organizational Design\". Yet the organization he designed was completely dysfunctional because he ignored how the business worked and instead hired arbitrary numbers of people according to some book he read. Half of the people at that company were 90% idle, while the other half were working 80 hour weeks because the \"organizational design\" person had strictly assigned responsibilities to arbitrary teams in a way that didn&#x27;t account for how the business actually worked.The next line from this post is exactly how he responded to every problem:> Imagine you hire someone to scale an area and their solution is to divide that area into 5 sub areas and hire someone for each of them to figure it out, etc. that’s their solution.He was never accountable for anything because he always had someone under him to blame. reply ethbr0 14 hours agoparentI interviewed a guy the other day.CS degree.\"I have a proven track record of building and leading amazing engineering teams.\"\"Okay.

This person included 5 years-ish of Haskell experience on their resume. I don&#x27;t know Haskell at all, but am aware of the language and its design principles, so I figured a lot of my technical questions would be pretty easy for himBoy was I wrong. My first question was \"Name the most common data structures you use day to day\". He stayed silent for a bit and then said \"What, do you want me to just list them?\" I said yes. After some more silence he said he couldn&#x27;t recall any. The fact that he said \"list\" was particularly ironic.I kind of gave up on expecting used-to-be software developers to have retained a single bit of knowledge from their time as a dev after they&#x27;ve moved on to \"leadership\" or \"management\". I believe it&#x27;s important for technical leadership to understand technical problems and their solutions in broad strokes, but it seems I&#x27;m mostly in the minority in the real world. That interview (and trying to hire for that role) really showed me how little engineering leaders remember about software. reply fho 18 minutes agorootparentThat&#x27;s interesting ... Might be my specific view on Haskell, but there is a lot of emphasis on using the right data structure for the right job. That&#x27;s probably because due to Haskell being immutable you have to rethink which standard data structures you can reasonable use. reply faangiq 3 hours agorootparentprevWhy not ask him what a bit is?This is a low IQ question. reply zo1 14 hours agorootparentprevMaybe this is a reverse fizz-buzz filtering test.

If I were asked this question unexpectedly, I&#x27;d probably trip over myself a few times as I thought through it out loud. reply ethbr0 14 hours agorootparentMy high water mark was the basics... and then the candidate drawing an analogy between char as primitive and char-array-based-strings as object oriented classes that offered additional functionality on top of chars. reply janstice 11 hours agorootparentThat sounds like someone who will make a four-page fizzbuzz solution, which was at one stage a highlight for us.What I try to get candidates to do in interviews is find the project they are most proud of, and get them to talk about it at a technical level - the constraints, challenges & solutions. That’s much harder to fake than pretty much anything else, and works at any technical level. My theory is that if they can communicate technical things in enough detail, and show that they have sufficient depth in at least one area they should be able to move sideways into our stack and context. reply ethbr0 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve also had good luck asking about a project they were on that went off the rails and what they&#x27;d do differently next time around.You can tell pretty quickly how involved they were and if they were thinking through solutions vs just doing as told. reply squeaky-clean 8 hours agorootparentI also ask the same question.

Its not a fair assessment if you don&#x27;t tell which has more utility for you, or don&#x27;t tell the recruiter how to help people prepare and just gaslight people with \"there&#x27;s no right&#x2F;wrong answer, I just want to see how you think\" if you actually want someone that does what they were told or someone that synthesized solutions.

Large swaths of the USA (notably Appalachia and also the desert southwest) have a substantially lower median standard of living than most of Europe.Anyway, even if your claims about the USA were true, that by itself doesn&#x27;t connect them to the VC risk&#x2F;reward culture under discussion. reply mufti_menk 9 hours agorootparent>Of the 10 countries with the highest median income, 7 of them are European.These countries are Luxembourg, Norway, Switzerland, Austria, Iceland, Netherlands and Belgium.

Air conditioning. Cheap gas. Road trips where you have a personal vehicle when you arrive. Hot water in 100% of all handwashing sinks. Urgent care centers. Whole Foods.You&#x27;re 100% wrong about not needing air conditioning in Germany. Many of the last 45 days here have been above 24C. You&#x27;re just used to being sweaty and uncomfortable.A doctor who worked at Charite in Berlin told me last month that the whole summer he worked there he struggled to not drip sweat directly into patients as he leaned over them to work. reply DoughnutHole 20 minutes agorootparentMost of these are cultural&#x2F;political choices, not a result of some lack of prosperity.Less cheap gas is a result of taxing the negative externalities of fossil fuels. Air con is rarer because intense summer heat (while it happens) is less pervasive and extreme than in most of the US. Personal vehicles are less common because public transport is great.

The difference is that for many trips, you have the choice to do it the other way too, which is not feasible in the USA for most destinations.Not only that, but if you choose to travel in a camper, in EU you have a plethora of dirt cheap places to legally pull in overnight that have bathrooms and if you need it water & electric.

You need customers more than VCs. reply kcsavvy 14 hours agoprevElements of this story indicate a founder who simply lost control of their company, which is their job as a founder. I don’t think the VC is the villain here.They raised at an inflated valuation and seemingly received a favorable multiple (100-10x “7-figure” revenue). The fact that they rode out the company to 0 means they had board control and were never fired. So they are ultimately responsible for every decision they made. Including over-hiring and not firing their clueless VPs.I say this as a founder of a yc-backed company that was acquired. I know the pressures of short-sided VCs. I also know that the job of a founder is to pick which advice you follow. reply jacquesm 14 hours agoparentExactly that&#x27;s the big takeaway: he didn&#x27;t learn what he should have learned: that it was his horse to lead. A CEO that slavishly follows the VCs has abdicated. reply jacquesm 14 hours agoprevI can condense this to &#x27;I thought CEO was a nice title but I failed at taking it seriously and allowed others to lead my company whilst I held the title&#x27;.The results are predictable. Note how there is no acceptance of personal responsibility.I also note that there isn&#x27;t a shred of evidence for this whole story, and $100M to $0 does not seem like a believable trajectory (nor does $0 to $100M, but the other is much less believable). reply master_crab 13 hours agoparentI’m willing to accept the 0 to 100M to 0 plot line. But I agree, if this was a truly productive post the poster would have also admitted some level of personal culpability. They are the founder after all and the VC is just another stakeholder. The founder hired those VPs, not the VCs.A key requirement of any company is managing your equity holders. reply t0mas88 14 hours agoparentprev$100M to 0 sounds plausible for a founder with common stock in a VC led company with little success. You can raise a lot of money without much revenue or track record, but it will come with all kinds of liquidation preferences leaving common stock at 0 if things don&#x27;t go like a rocket ship. reply firefoxd 14 hours agoprevThis sounds like the start up I left a couple years ago. I was employee number 3. I took a deep pay cut to join them. I shared a cubicle with the ceo and cto, the two cofounders. Tight nit group.A year later, we had our first round of vc fund. I had a slight bump in salary, but owned stocks so all is good. My role was, make-things-work-at-all-cost. I&#x27;d be on calls with customers and their engineers to make things work. I&#x27;d generate specialized reports by merging data locally, I&#x27;d get a calls on my personal phone from customers. We did the things that don&#x27;t scale.Year 2, we are 30 employees getting ready for another round of funding, the ceo and cto spent all their time in vc meetings. I worked in all my waking hours, it was unsustainable. I told them I needed a break, the way they responded showed me that I was just another replaceable employee.I packed my stuff and left, they tried to screw with my stocks, but i fought back and got it all. They got their second funding. They never replaced me. Instead of hiring 2 or 3 people to do my job in a scalable manner, they stopped offering the service all together. Instead they went with buzzwords in AI.Fast forward 3 years. The company was acquired, the stocks are worth 0 dollars, and most employees got fired. Though the linkedin post sounds like a success story. reply pyrophane 14 hours agoparentHow did your stock wind up being worth $0?

The large majority of the startup founders I&#x27;ve met all have dreams of building a rocket ship, not of building a happy small business.

If you hired someone from a traditional manufacturing company, maybe not. reply Waterluvian 14 hours agorootparentI think more than anything this demonstrates the “my context must be everyone’s context” fallacy.The VC world is a little slice of the tech world.

Is that capital raised, ARR, GMV? Makes a big difference in terms of understanding what kind of business they built. reply mdorazio 15 hours agoparentAlmost certainly that was $100M valuation. reply necubi 15 hours agorootparentIt must be valuation (if there&#x27;s a SaaS company that&#x27;s ever gone from $0 -> $100MM ARR -> $0 within five years I would be very surprised).But that makes this whole thing pretty circular—they only would have $100MM valuation because they sold a story of growth to investors. Assuming that the round at $100M valuation was during the boom times of 2019-2021, that could have been with as little as $3-5M annual revenue (20-25x multiplier).Assuming slow or no growth, a company with $3M in revenue would be worth$3-4M, and $10M in the bank. Raised $20M at $100M perhaps? Seems reasonable, 25x-30x revenue.It makes sense. If he got there quick, his product was working, and it had a chance at gold.

Most forms of debt for a small company rely on you being a creditor meaning you can be in the hole if your company fails.Overall getting money is hard and nuanced which makes sense given there is nearly infinite demand for it. reply version_five 15 hours agoprevI would have preferred to see this written as a blog post, there&#x27;s nothing that requires anonymity imo if presented the right way, and it would make it more credible.

I think wouldn’t be that surprised if somebody fist used a text editor when they first got into Linux or programming. reply sodality2 18 hours agorootparentI’d imagine most people’s first impression would be Notepad on windows- I wouldn’t count Word or even WordPad. reply kingkongjaffa 17 hours agorootparentIt was definitely notepad to edit some obscure .ini files on some pc game, or reading a Readme on a cracked&#x2F;pirated game. On windows that would be the obvious case.Downloading something over limewire or torrent and seeing a readme file for the first time is a pretty strong memory.My first IDE was visual studio writing Visual Basic, I quickly binned that for netbeans and Java and then I think ended up using Eclipse.Today I’m a casual evil mode emacs user mostly for magit and org-mode. also working in VScode for web languages. reply bee_rider 17 hours agorootparentprevI bet you are right.But, I also think there’s enough leeway in the idea of “using a tool” to not be surprised that somebody doesn’t count a one-off use of notepad. And I think there must exist at least some people who really never used notepad.Nowadays I only assume someone between, like, 30 and 50 will inherently have to have used Windows at some point. Outside that range, you might get graybeards who were around before Windows, or younger folks who only ever used smartphones.Anyway, all that rambling is to say, I’d put it in the “most but not shocking to hear otherwise” category. reply Eddygandr 15 hours agorootparentDo you really think people younger than 30 won’t be using Windows in school or at home? reply bee_rider 13 hours agorootparentI mean, there exist and have always existed people who’ve never used it at home. And there exist and (ever since it came out) have existed people who have.What I’ve tried to express is that there’s a small band where not having used it is unusual and surprising, and that isn’t the case anymore. I still think the majority of people have used Windows at least a handful of times but hearing that somebody hasn’t no longer produces a “how could anyone” sort of response. reply xwdv 14 hours agorootparentprevThey will use it, but they don’t know it’s Windows or what an OS is.

Ok, it didn&#x27;t have much in the way of an actual GUI, but it ran in a window which wasn&#x27;t the shell&#x2F;CLI window.

I used pico on Unix before learning vi, for example, which is probably a common progression. reply kazinator 16 hours agoprevVim goes back to 1988, publicly released in 1991.I&#x27;ve been using it for 29 years now.The last 20 years don&#x27;t mean anything; the Vim codebase is too much of a dumpster fire for anything significant to happen in that time span.They had to fork an entire parallel command set to implement \"location lists\" (new in Vim 7, I think) which are exactly like the \"quickfix list\". Most of the difference are that location list commands start with l, wheras quickfix list commands start with c. Your keybinding to go to the next quickfix item doesn&#x27;t work in a location list because it uses :cn^M, but the location list wants :ln^M or whatever. The only explanation for this ridiculous state of affairs must be that it was too difficult to extend quickfix lists to do the things that location lists do. Once you get into the Vim codebase, that will not be surprising.Vim&#x27;s visual editing semantics assumes that you have a block cursor, and that that the character covered by the cursor is included in a visual selection. This is not so nice when you switch your terminal to an I-beam (or vertical line) cursor, which references between characters. If the cursor is to the left of the selection start, it includes the character to the left of the cursor too. I-beam semantics allows for a zero-length selection, whereas in block semantics, there is always at least one character in the selection, which is the one under the cursor. I-beam semantics is virtually what pretty much all GUI editors do, including the text widget in Firefox I&#x27;m using now to type this.A bunch of years ago I looked into what it would take to have a flag in Vim to flip to I-beam semantics for selection. Gack! I estimated a month of full time work. Numerous places in the code would have to change in ways where you&#x27;re not sure what side effect they will have elsewhere. reply pydave 14 hours agoparent> Your keybinding to go to the next quickfix item doesn&#x27;t work in a location list because it uses :cn^M, but the location list wants :ln^M or whatever.Navigating quickfix and location lists is global, so a single common command wouldn&#x27;t make sense (you can use `:cn` from any window -- even if the quickfix is not visible). However, you could use a `` map to use the same key to navigate within loclist&#x2F;quickfire windows.> The only explanation for this ridiculous state of affairs must be that it was too difficult to extend quickfix lists to do the things that location lists do.Their entire concept is to be what quickfix isn&#x27;t: instead of a global list, it&#x27;s a list that&#x27;s tied to a window. I can&#x27;t think of features that a loclists have but quickfix doesn&#x27;t unrelated to their nonglobal nature.I can&#x27;t claim vim&#x27;s code is easy to understand, but this is not a fair complaint. reply lachlan_gray 14 hours agoparentprevYou could maybe switch to a block cursor when you’re in visual mode withlet &t_SI = \"\\e[6 q\" andlet &t_EI = \"\\e[2 q\"in some auto commands to sort of address this reply ykonstant 32 minutes agorootparentIndeed, I use block cursor in visual and normal mode, I beam in insert mode and underscore in replace mode. reply kazinator 6 hours agorootparentprevThis seems like a good compromise. Also, say, the r command which replaces the character under the cursor could also switch to a block cursor momentarily. E.g. a|bType r, and b gets covered by a block cursor. Then type c, and b is replaced by c, and cursor goes back to bar. reply xnx 20 hours agoprevCool tool! I had to double check because I thought Vim was much older.

Most editors have a vi mode, but they don&#x27;t compare to vim because they are awkward to script and don&#x27;t have powerful regular expressions so readily available (both introduced in vim).We could thank Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie for enabling vi, but I thank Bram for keeping vi viable, portable, and well-supported across languages. reply zabzonk 11 hours agorootparentnot sure thompson or ritchie ever used vi, or really enabled it. it is quite similar to the text editors on vax. reply bluenose69 14 hours agoparentprevSame for me: vi (later vim, later neovim) since the late 1970s.

She had not been able to eat after police showed up at the door of her home Friday with a search warrant in hand. Neither was she able to sleep Friday night. She tearfully watched during the raid as police not only carted away her computer and a router used by an Alexa smart speaker but also dug through her son Eric’s personal bank and investments statements to photograph them. Electronic cords were left in a jumbled pile on her floor. Joan Meyer’s ability to stream TV shows at her home and to get help through her Alexa smart speakers were taken away with the electronics. As her home was raided, other officers descended upon the Record office, forcing staff members to stay outside the office for hours during a heat advisory. They were not allowed them to answer the phone or make any calls. Marion police chief Gideon Cody forcibly grabbed reporter Deb Gruver’s personal cell phone out of her hand, reinjuring one of her fingers, which previously had been dislocated. Officers seized personal cell phones and computers, including the newspaper’s file server, along with other equipment unrelated to the scope of their search. They refused to say when the items, necessary for publishing next week’s issue of the Record, might be returned. The newspaper has obtained equipment to ensure publication and is working to re-create material for the paper. Legal experts contacted by the Record termed the raid unheard of in America and reminiscent of what occurs in totalitarian regimes and the Third World. The Record is expected to file a federal suit against the City of Marion and those involved in the search, which legal experts contacted were unanimous in saying violated multiple state and federal laws, including the U.S. Constitution, and multiple court rulings. “Our first priority is to be able to publish next week,” publisher Eric Meyer said, “but we also want to make sure no other news organization is ever exposed to the Gestapo tactics we witnessed today. We will be seeking the maximum sanctions possible under law.” A two-page warrant signed by Magistrate Laura Viar was given to the Record at the time of the search. Marion vice mayor Ruth Herbel’s home also was raided at the same time. The warrants alleged there was probable cause to believe that identity theft and unlawful computer acts had been committed involving Marion business owner Kari Newell. A Record reporter later requested a copy of the probable cause affidavit necessary for issuance of the search warrant District court, where such items are supposed to be filed, issued a signed statement saying no affidavit was on file. County attorney Joel Ensey, whose brother owns the hotel where Newell operates her restaurant, was asked for it but said he would not release it because it was “not a public document.” Police read Record staff members their rights. Cody asked officer Zach Hudlin to read Gruver her rights because he couldn’t read a business-sized card listing them as he wasn’t wearing glasses. Denying staff access to the office and taking four computers meant that the reporters and the newspaper’s office manager could not do their jobs Friday. Officers disconnected a computer router at the Record but did not seize it. Law enforcement also seized a computer and a cell phone from Herbel’s home Friday morning. Herbel, 80, who does not have a land-line phone, later drove to McPherson to purchase a replacement phone so she could remain in contact in case of problems with her 88-year-old husband, who is disabled and suffers from dementia. Newell accused the Record at a city council meeting Aug. 7 of illegally obtaining drunken-driving information about her and supplying it to Herbel. The Record did not seek out the information. Rather, it was provided by a source who sent it to the newspaper via social media and also sent it to Herbel. After attempting to verify that the information was accurate and had been obtained, as the source claimed, from a public website, the Record decided not to publish it. After consulting an attorney and obtaining other information, Meyer thought the information had been intentionally leaked to the newspaper as part of legal sparring between Newell and her estranged husband over who should get title to various of the couple’s motor vehicles in divorce proceedings. That contention later was verified by Newell during discussions with Meyer. During attempts to verify the information, the Record accessed the same state web page that the source indicated had been used. During the verification attempt, Record reporter Phyllis Zorn made no attempt to conceal her identity, providing her name and knowingly clicking on a consent form verifying that she did not plan to disseminate the information — because, in fact, she did not plan to and did not do so. Afterward, Meyer consulted an attorney and, without naming Newell, on Aug. 4 notified Sheriff Jeff Soyez and Cody that the newspaper had received the information and that the source who provided it alleged that law enforcement officers knew Newell did not have a valid driver’s license and ignored her violation of the law. After the council meeting, Newell acknowledged the accuracy of the information and said she understood that coming forward with allegations about it might expose the information rather than preserve its confidentiality. The state suspended her license because of a drunken-driving conviction in 2008 and a series of other driving convictions. Newell speculated about who the source was and said she thought the information had been supplied to that person by her estranged husband as part of their divorce proceedings. She has said that she took care of her license this week. This, however, has not been verified. In the same post, she admitted driving without a license after her drunken-driving conviction. At Monday’s council meeting, Newell accused Herbel of acting “negligently and recklessly” by sharing her personal information. Herbel said she had received the information from the same source as the Record but had shared it with only one person — city administrator Brogan Jones — because Newell was on that day’s agenda to seek endorsement of a request for a catering liquor license, for which a drunken driving conviction in certain cases might have disqualified her. Herbel told Jones she thought the police should investigate Newell’s application. reply NoZebra120vClip 1 hour agorootparentWell if she weren&#x27;t dead already, she may have had a heart attack upon seeing HN commenters infringing her copyright reply pbjtime 6 hours agorootparentprevArchive.ph is your friend reply sleepybrett 7 hours agoprevAll this because someone leaked the paper a report about a local restaurateur getting a dui while driving without a license?

By encrypting your data with a key management service and enabling the providers audit services (aka cloudtrail) it is impossible by design to execute the warrant without the customer receiving audit trail information about the providers access of the keys and the data service. In theory the provider could make back doors, but the law actually is on their side in that they are not required to take extraordinary measures that materially impacts their business to circumvent controls.Further there is no physical seizure possible.I know most small newspapers this is beyond their technical ability or understanding.

The fact is it was issued by a judge, and it doesn’t sound like the police did anything specifically outside the scope of the warrant.If the warrant was issued illegally and there was some provable animus on behalf of the police, and&#x2F;or it was done as clear harassment, a civil case is the most likely to succeed. By establishing certain facts such as these and proving the degree of distress caused, they can likely bring about a significant judgement against the city and possibly go as far as a sanction on the judge depending on how she was involved.If it turns out it was a conspiracy between the restaurant owner and the police where they conspired to manipulate the judge into issuing an illegal warrant, the restaurant owner is the most likely to face a criminal charge.I suspect they will also pursue a criminal or civil case on the basis of harassment of journalists doing protected work based on a false identity theft assertion to justify avoiding the legal requirement to issue a subpoena rather than a warrant. The co-owners death won’t be a material fact in that sort of case but I’m sure would be mentioned to sharpen the case.Regardless I expect popcorn is warming all over the country among folks with an interest in law. reply dragonwriter 6 hours agorootparent> I suspect they will also pursue a criminal or civil case on the basis of harassment of journalists doing protected work based on a false identity theft assertion to justify avoiding the legal requirement to issue a subpoena rather than a warrant. The co-owners death won’t be a material fact in that sort of case but I’m sure would be mentioned to sharpen the case.The death would absolutely be relevant in a criminal case (e.g., under the applicable federal statute matching the described conspiracy against protected conduct, it changes the maximum penalty from ten years to death or life in prison), in a civil case, it may also be relevant, as it would likely be among the harms forming the basis for damages. (It may even be the basis of the tort, e.g., if pursued as wrongful death, where the part you describe is the “wrongful” part.) reply fnordpiglet 6 hours agorootparentFair enough - I wasn’t thinking about in a sentencing context but in a materiality in the establishment of a crime, as the crime would have to somehow encompass the death which seems hard to establish without some direct action. reply mcpackieh 7 hours agoparentprevHomicide by inducement of stress?

Second, the rule you state usually doesn&#x27;t exist; many states have abolished the misdemeanor manslaughter rule or limited iy to a narrow class of misdemeanors, so that death in the course of a misdemeanor isn’t automatically manslaughter, and in states that retain it the class of manslaughter it becomes is a often a wobbler (can itself be a misdemeanor, or a felony, not always a felony.) reply greyface- 7 hours agorootparentprevGood luck making it through voir dire. reply lightedman 6 hours agorootparentTell me you&#x27;ve never done jury duty without telling me you&#x27;ve never done jury duty. replystaplers 8 hours agoparentprevIs this satire?Read about Eric Garner for \"repercussions\" of literal caught-on-camera homicide.It took an entire country rioting to get justice for George Floyd.. there won&#x27;t even be an investigation into this. reply pengaru 7 hours agorootparent> It took an entire country rioting to get justice for George Floyd.. there won&#x27;t even be an investigation into this.George Floyd was black, this is an elderly white mother.
