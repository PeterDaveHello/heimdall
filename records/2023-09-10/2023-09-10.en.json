For anyone trying promptfoo&#x27;s local model Ollama provider, Ollama can be found at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jmorganca&#x2F;ollamaFrom some early poking around with a basic coding question using Code Llama locally (`ollama:codellama:7b` `ollama:codellama:13b` etc in promptfoo) it seems like quantization has little effect on the output, but changing the parameter count has pretty dramatic effects. This is quite interesting since the 8-bit quantized 7b model is about the same size as a 4-bit 13b model. Perhaps this is just one test though – will be trying this with more tests! reply layoric 10 hours agoparentprevTooling focusing on custom evaluation and testing is sorely lacking, so thank you for building and sharing this! reply dgut 15 hours agoparentprevThis is impressive. Good work. reply jongjong 2 hours agoprevI was playing around with GPT a while back and I found that it could come up with some good jokes if I started the joke with a subject.For example, I started with a prompt \"Tell me a joke which starts with: I&#x27;m so poor, the mouse\" and it completed the joke as:\"I&#x27;m so poor, the mouse in my house brings its own cheese.\"Some other ones I still remember which cracked me up:\"I&#x27;m so poor, after I stepped on a cockroach, I called my accountant to see if I could claim it as a capital loss.\"\"You&#x27;re so poor, when you declared bankruptcy, the rats in your house filed a claim for unpaid rent.\"\"You&#x27;re so poor, you declared bankruptcy at a lemonade stand.\"\"You&#x27;re so poor, when you walk, the dirt beneath you feels rich.\"\"You&#x27;re so poor, dust whispers your name when it settles.\"\"Fickle as a squirrel at a nut convention!\"\"Fickle as a dog in a fire hydrant factory!\"\"Fickle as a flip-flop in a shoe shop sale!\" reply anaganisk 24 minutes agoparentAh the boilerplate Reddit comments. I mean LLM definitely have been trained on them anyway so. reply ulnarkressty 15 hours agoprevThis is better that the regular benchmarks and LLM tricks such as passing some exam or other because it&#x27;s unlikely that they were part of the training set for said LLMs. It also mirrors my experience, that GPT4 is way ahead of everything else but still manages to break in weird ways.I think we are past the magical talking dog stage and being amazed that an LLM is able to output a Fibonacci function doesn&#x27;t really help with the progress. As others have commented, this page is a step in the right direction (except the Fibonacci part :).That being said, the fact that the questions are now online will make them part of the training set sooner or later. Which is to say the only way to reliably evaluate an LLM is by not leaking the test set and being deliberately opaque about what&#x27;s being asked. Which raises some interesting trust questions. reply bugglebeetle 14 hours agoparentMy experience with GPT-4 is that half the battle is knowing when to reset the context for a back-and-forth. For things like coding, after multiple revisions of code, it begins to get confused about which instance of the code&#x2F;context to which it should refer. Resetting things back to a new frame with whatever the next query or request is generally resolves things.OpenAI’s “magic talking dog” aspect is making you believe it has effective long-term recall, when in reality, it’s fairly limited and impacts reasoning the longer an exchange gets. reply HenryBemis 14 hours agorootparent3.5 (not surprisingly) has the same effect.I tend to ask for modifications on the &#x27;latest&#x27; output.If I need to roll back to a previous version, (2-3 outputs back) I either copy & paste and ask ChatGPT it to ignore all other versions and focus on the one I just pasted, or if I don&#x27;t need my in-between comments, I copy & paste the desired version on a new chat, and rename as \"archive - code XYZ\" for the previous one. reply bugglebeetle 13 hours agorootparentI’ve tried this as well, but it still seems to accumulate errors with subsequent responses, i.e. it will reset but then refer to the wrong context in the next response. reply nojs 19 hours agoprev> Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?The site reports every LLM as getting this wrong. But GPT4 seems to get it right for me:> Sally has 3 brothers. Since each brother has 2 sisters and Sally is one of those sisters, the other sister is the second sister for each brother. So, Sally has 1 sister. reply Terretta 19 hours agoparentFrom the ChatGPT app, using GPT-4 model, using my own custom prompt for such puzzles: “You are better than Marilyn Vos Savant at solving brain teaser logic puzzles step by step. Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?”Certainly! Let&#x27;s break it down step by step:1. Sally has 3 brothers.2. Each of those brothers has two sisters. Since all the brothers share the same two sisters, we are essentially hearing about the same sisters each time, not accumulating more sisters with each brother mentioned.3. We know that Sally is a sister to her brothers, so she is one of the two sisters each brother has.By putting it all together, we find that there must be another sister. Therefore, Sally has one sister.---New chats with no history, no custom prompt, and no system prompt, first interaction in the chat this question: “Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?”All Answers (not cherry picked):Sally has 1 sister. In the description, Sally is counted as one of the two sisters that each brother has. This means the brothers have another sister apart from Sally.. . .Sally has 1 sister. In the description, it mentioned that \"Each brother has 2 sisters.\" This implies that there is Sally and another sister, since we know that all the brothers share the same sisters.. . .Sally has one sister. Each of her brothers has two sisters, counting Sally and the other sister.. . .Sally has 1 sister. Here&#x27;s how we figure it out:Sally has 3 brothers, and each of these brothers has 2 sisters. Since the brothers share the same sisters, we know that the two sisters must be Sally and another girl. So, Sally has 1 sister.. . .I have gotten zero wrong answers from GPT-4 in OpenAI’s ChatGPT app. reply ddol 13 hours agorootparentI first asked GPT-4 “james (a boy) has four sisters, and each sister has three brothers. how many brothers does james have?”[0] and it told me 3 brothers. I then asked it to think though step by step and it said 2.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chat.openai.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;859baa94-3edb-40f0-9c74-8b1403... reply facu17y 18 hours agorootparentprevIt might be trained on this question or a variant of it. reply civilitty 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s certainly RLHFed. All of the logic puzzles I use for evaluation that used to fail months ago now pass no problem and I&#x27;ve even had a hard time modifying them to fail. reply ydant 14 hours agorootparentAnd it&#x27;s only fixed for the stated case, but if you reverse the genders, GPT-4 gets it wrong. Q: Bobby (a boy) has 3 sisters. Each sister has 2 brothers. How many brothers does Bobby have? Let&#x27;s think step by step. A: First, we know that Bobby has 3 sisters. Second, we know that each sister has 2 brothers. This means that Bobby has 2 brothers because the sisters&#x27; brothers are Bobby and his two brothers. So, Bobby has 2 brothers. reply MPSimmons 14 hours agorootparentInteresting. Here&#x27;s what I got on GPT-4 with no additional prompting:Alright, let&#x27;s break it down step by step:1. We know Bobby has 3 sisters.2. Each of those sisters has 2 brothers.Now, when we say that each sister has 2 brothers, Bobby is one of those brothers. This implies there&#x27;s another boy in addition to Bobby.3. That other boy would be Bobby&#x27;s only brother.Therefore, Bobby has 1 brother. reply appplication 17 hours agorootparentprevThis is sort of a bummer because it’s not actually an improvement to the model, but just a patch job to artificially inflate performance. All it does is make true evaluation more difficult. Classic “you get what you measure”. reply carlossouza 15 hours agorootparentAnd what’s more data to a model if not patches that inflate performance?The more data we use to train a model (or as you said, the more patches we use), the better it’s performance will be. reply sudosysgen 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s a tiny amount of data given undue weight to increase the score. It&#x27;s memorization more than generalization. reply ruszki 15 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think that it’s not an improvement. It’s not an improvement in context of finding new genuine solutions, sure.But that’s definitely not needed most of the time in real life for an average person, just like it’s not needed for an average developer anymore. reply simonh 11 minutes agorootparentIt creates the impression that the tool can do something it actually can’t, or is good at something when it isn’t. reply posterboy 15 hours agorootparentprevClassic tell me what you need proven and I&#x27;ll forge you the statistics.Here is hope they use something like category theory mixed with philosophy to put it on a secure foundation reply rnk 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a really interesting suggestion. What would it mean to do those two things that you say. What would philosophy mean in terms of an llm, and what would category theory do? reply civilitty 16 hours agorootparentprevMaybe, maybe not. The magic of LLMs is their ability to generalize both from the human language in the data set and examples in the prompt. If RLHF training improves on that generalization, then it&#x27;s just a matter of getting a big enough high quality dataset (and not crippling it with censorship). This is probably what&#x27;s given OpenAI their initial advantage.Time will tell I guess. reply FrustratedMonky 15 hours agorootparentprevAre you implying that to counter these logic puzzles that GPT4 was specifically trained on logic puzzles so it would know the answers?In that case, just make new problems. If it is being &#x27;patched&#x27; to pass specific known problems, then the new ones would fail.If it is able to answer them, then maybe it is actually analyzing them and working out the solution.Not sure how you can assume there was no underlying improvement, and these are cases of feeding it the answers. reply thaumasiotes 2 hours agorootparent> Not sure how you can assume there was no underlying improvement, and these are cases of feeding it the answers.Compare> And it&#x27;s only fixed for the stated case, but if you reverse the genders, GPT-4 gets it wrong. reply WanderPanda 17 hours agorootparentprevSeems like we are going back from „compute&#x2F;scale is the new oil“ to „your curated fine-tuning and user interaction dataset is the new oil“ again reply delusional 17 hours agoparentprevOpenAI really ought to provide some sort of hash of the model to be included with stuff like this. Right now there&#x27;s no way to know if the results are comparable. As an extreme example it&#x27;s possible that they&#x27;re not even running the model for this question and are just opportunistically feeding back canned responses.That is, we know that OpenAI are saving the responses, it&#x27;s not unlikely that they train on bad responses.It&#x27;s the same problem as GPU benchmarks in the olden days, when drivers would detect the usage pattern of the benchmark and enable special optimizations that boosted the benchmark. reply Grimblewald 1 hour agorootparentthat&#x27;s what their frozen models are for. For example, I could use gpt-4-0314 or gpt-4-0613 or the current version - simply \"gpt-4\" Those numbers appended at the end indicate snapshots of the model at a particular stage in development. It isn&#x27;t perfect, since model versions get discontinued over time, but it is something. reply amrrs 16 hours agoparentprevFalcon-180B also got it right> Since Sally is a girl, she can be considered as one of the sisters. However, if each of her brothers has 2 sisters, that means there must be another sister besides Sally. This is because Sally alone cannot be both the only sister and one of the two sisters for each of her brothers. Thus, Sally has 1 more sister. reply belter 17 hours agoparentprevI confirm GPT-4 solves this correctly. Makes me immediately doubt everything else in the article... reply glinkot 1 hour agorootparentWhen calling the GPT-4 API I get this answer:Sally has 2 sisters. Each brother counts Sally and two other girls as sisters, which means there are three girls in total. Since one of these girls is Sally herself, that leaves two others as her sisters.When I said &#x27;nope&#x27;, it corrected itself and gave the right answer. reply vincelt 16 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried replicating via the API with a temp of 0? reply belter 16 hours agorootparentNo I did not. reply moffkalast 15 hours agorootparentprevUsing a temp of zero usually returns garbage results from most models, so it would likely do so in case of GPT 4 as well. Any other great ideas? reply taberiand 12 hours agorootparentThe point isn&#x27;t that temp 0 should be used, the point is that anyone surprised that they get different results should realise that there is an element of randomness involved by default.Even repeating the same question in a single chat can have GPT-4 vary on its output, though it will often settle on a particular output due to context informing the output (which is why adding context is so important for these models) reply Grimblewald 1 hour agorootparentprevNot in my experience, in fact I find that when I need precise, realistic, and reliable results temp 0 is needed. For example, here is a bunch of names, gather the names of specific plastics under headings matching their common acronym - if I don&#x27;t use temp 0 I might get nonsense out. Temp 0? reliably correct. reply moffkalast 1 hour agorootparentInteresting, that&#x27;s the exact opposite of my experience. reply afro88 14 hours agorootparentprevTemp of 0 gives the least random and most predictable results reply moffkalast 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true, but those results are rarely the correct ones, at least for v1 llama models. In my experience each model has an optimal temperature at which it performs vastly better. I&#x27;m sure OpenAI have the best config they know set up for ChatGPT but let people generate trash through the API if they want to waste their credits on it. reply dontreact 10 hours agorootparentWhy would the accuracy decrease with lower temperature? Setting temperature to 0 just means at each step the model will emit the token with the highest likelihood. reply moffkalast 2 hours agorootparentYes that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m saying, to reiterate: The likeliest token does not lead to the highest performing result. Otherwise temperature wouldn&#x27;t even be an option. I would imagine things like language word frequency affect the token rating a lot while having nothing to do with the task at hand except providing a correctly formatted answer, but it&#x27;s probably not the whole story.OpenAI (and others that know what they&#x27;re doing) always do their benchmarks in a multi-sampled way, by running 5 or 20 times at optimal temp. Using a wrapper that runs these samples and then another pass that judges self-consistency for a final answer can give you a correct answer 100% of the time for a question that would be wrong 100% of the time with temp at zero. reply circuit10 15 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean? It works fine for me when I’ve tried it reply mmcwilliams 18 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s kind of the issue with non-deterministic LLMs, isn&#x27;t it? reply redox99 18 hours agorootparentLLMs are deterministic. However to make them more \"creative\", the outputs of the LLM can be sampled using something called temperature that adds some randomness. You can set the temperature to 0 and it will be deterministic.Having said that, GPT4 is not deterministic even at 0 temperature, either because of a bug in their implementation, or because of some load balancing among their alleged mixture of experts. reply 101011 18 hours agorootparentThis was interesting to me, so I dug a bit further. This gives a bit more context behind why: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.openai.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;observing-discrepancy-in-comp...Quote below:Even with a greedy decoding strategy, small discrepancies regarding floating point operations lead to divergent generations. In simpler terms: when the top-two tokens have very similar log-probs, there’s a non-zero probability of choosing the least probable one due to the finite number of digits that you’re using for multiplying probs and storing them.It should also be noted that, as the decoding occurs in an autoregressive way, once you have picked a different token the whole generated sequence will diverge, as this choice affects to the probability of generating every subsequent token. reply scarmig 17 hours agorootparentBut why are there discrepancies in the floating point arithmetic? They have errors when approximating the reals, but floating point operations are all well-defined: even if 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3, it&#x27;s still always true that 0.1 + 0.2 == 0.1 + 0.2. I figure the issue must be something related to concurrency in a fleet of GPUs during inference, but even then it&#x27;s not clear to me where the nondeterminism would creep in. Maybe different experts simultaneously work on an inference and the first to respond wins? Switching to models with different quantization depending on load? reply imagainstit 16 hours agorootparentFloating point math is not associative: (a + b) + c != a + (b + c)This leads to different results from accumulating sums in different orderings. Accumulating in different ordering is common in parallel math operations. reply scarmig 11 hours agorootparentSo I guess here my question is why a GPU would perform accumulations in a nondeterministic way where the non-associativity of FP arithmetic matters. You could require that a + b + c always be evaluated left to right and then you&#x27;ve got determinism, which all things being equal is desirable. Presumably because relaxing that constraint allows for some significant performance benefits, but how? Something like avoiding keeping a buffer of all the weights*activations before summing? reply SomewhatLikely 9 hours agorootparentThere has been speculation that GPT4 is a mixture of experts model, where each expert could be hosted on a different machine. As those machines may report their results to the aggregating machine in different orders then the results could be summed in different orders. reply ossopite 11 hours agorootparentprevfor performance reasons, yes, I believe it&#x27;s because the accumulation is over parallel computations so the ordering is at the mercy of the scheduler. but I&#x27;m not familiar with the precise detailsedit: at 13:42 in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TB07_mUMt0U&t=13m42s there is an explanation of the phenomenon in the context of training but I suspect the same kind of operation is happening during inference reply charcircuit 15 hours agorootparentprevHis point is that you do not have to rely on associative being true in order to run inference on a LLM. reply WanderPanda 17 hours agorootparentprevAs OpenAI I would be so horribly uncomfortable about this that making it deterministic would be one of my top priorities. How can they sleep at night?! reply bbarnett 12 hours agorootparentOn a big pile of money?! reply swores 16 hours agorootparentprevIf ChatGPT is a) usually used with a setting that makes it non-deterministic and b) for whatever reason, is also non-deterministic when that setting is not used... then why did you comment as if the person calling it a non-deterministic LLM was incorrect? They didn&#x27;t claim all LLMs are, or must be, non-deterministic, just that it&#x27;s a problem with this one that is. reply moonchrome 15 hours agorootparentprevEven 3.5 turbo API is non deterministic with 0 temperature. reply kordlessagain 18 hours agorootparentprevEnsembles be ensembling. reply adrian_b 18 hours agoparentprevGPT 4 and another LLM have given the right answer only after adding \"Let&#x27;s think step by step.\" to the original prompt.With the simpler prompt, all the answers were wrong, most of them ridiculously wrong. reply Joeri 18 hours agorootparentThere seems to be a maximum amount of reasoning llm’s can do per token (per unit of computation). If you prompt it to use more tokens before it outputs the final answer (think step by step, check your answer, …) it becomes smarter. People have lucked into different prompting strategies to get it to do this, but there probably are more.Ultimately I feel it is fairer to benchmark llm’s by what they can be prompted into. After all, we let people carefully work through a problem during exams so it seems fair to hold llm’s to the same standard. reply kaashif 18 hours agorootparentIf we&#x27;re under attack, launch the nukes.Oh wait, forgot something:Think it through step by step.Phew, close one. reply 0xDEF 18 hours agorootparentprevI asked GPT-4 through both ChatGPT and the API and it responded correctly without any fiddling.I keep seeing comments and posts on HN that significantly downplay GPT-4&#x27;s capabilities.

You can make a Markov chain by just counting the frequency of letters that follow each letter giving one that has a context window of one or two characters. That is a very simple Markov chain. You can make it by hand. You can make ones with more context window like a dozen characters or a few words, using sophisticated smoothing and regularization methods and not just frequency counts. Those are also simple Markov chains that you can do without neural net or GPU. Then you can also make a Markov chain that has a context window of thousands of tokens that is made from neural nets and massive training data and differentiable tensor computing libraries with data centers full of hardware linear algebra accelerators. Those are some even bigger Markov chains!> LLMs are way more complicated than simple Markov chains.That&#x27;s true, they are more complicated than simple Markov chains, if by simple Markov chains you mean ones with small context window.

How many sisters does Sally have?Llama: Hello there! I&#x27;d be happy to help you with that question. Let me think... If each of Sally&#x27;s brothers has two sisters, then together they would have 6 sisters in total (2 x 3 = 6). So, Sally would have 6 sisters as well. Is that the answer you were looking for?User: no. Think about it. Sally is a sister to the brothersLlama: Ah, I see what you mean now! In this case, since Sally is one of the siblings, she only counts as one of her own sisters. Therefore, Sally has only one sister - herself. Does that make sense?User: yesLlama: Great!

A widget in a movie is meant to do a function, and does that function. A widget in reality is meant to extract money from you, and&#x2F;or your insurer, and&#x2F;or your government, and it begrudgingly does the absolute minimum it can to make you even consider buying it.I&#x27;ve spent last two decades trying to unlearn expectations set by fictional movies, and I&#x27;m still not good at it. Star Trek, in particular, gives me a lot of grief, because it often does good enough work of showing how technology, people, organizations and societies would function if they were free of the petty exploitative bullshit.

My internet research suggested that there were a number of potential problems with most brands, but that the Intel Extreme was reliable.So I specified that it must be only that SSD model. And it was very fast and completely reliable. Pretty expensive also, but not much compared to the total cost of the project.Then months later a \"hardware expert\" was brought on and they insisted that the SSD be replaced by a mechanical disk because supposedly SSDs were entirely unreliable. I tried to explain about the particular model being an exception.

After all, LLMs are designed to reason equal to or better than humans. reply sirk390 17 hours agorootparentHumans are pretty bad at these questions. Even with the simplest questions like \"Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many sisters does Sally have?\" I think that a lot of people will give an incorrect answer. And for questions like \"Argue for and against the use of kubernetes in the style of a haiku\", 99.99% will not be able to do it. reply earthboundkid 13 hours agorootparentThe thing with humans is they will say “I don’t remember how many syllables a haiku has” and “what the hell is kubernetes?” No LLM can reliably produce a haiku because their lexing process deprives them of reliable information about syllable counts. They should all say “I’m sorry, I can’t count syllables, but I’ll try my best anyway.” But the current models don’t do that because they were trained on texts by humans, who can do haiku, and not properly taught their own limits by reinforcement learning. It’s Dunning Kruger gone berserk. reply pixl97 11 hours agorootparentEh, it&#x27;s not D&K gone berserk, it&#x27;s what happens when you attempt to compress reality down to a single dimension (text). If you&#x27;re doing a haiku, you will likely subvocalize it to ensure you&#x27;re saying it correctly. It will be interesting when we get multimodal AI that can speak and listen to itself to detect things like this. reply earthboundkid 8 hours agorootparentThe problem isn’t just that everything is text. It’s that everything is a Fourier transform of text in such a way that it’s not actually possible for an LLM to learn to count syllables. reply maweaver 18 hours agorootparentprevBy \"Humans\", I assume you mean something like \"adult humans, well-educated in the relevant fields\".

Yes, if one&#x27;s trying to compare human and GPT intelligence, then you have to define what counts as memorisation and what counts as reasoning. But what most people outside of academia are trying to do is work out whether a GPT can effectively replace a human in some time-consuming task, and to be able to do so without access to the internet is rarely an important factor. reply rvz 6 hours agorootparentprev> After all, LLMs are designed to reason equal to or better than humans.No.I doubt you would fully trust a LLM to replace high risk jobs such as lawyers, doctors or pilots such that when something goes wrong as it is used unattended, there is no-one held to account for it to transparently explain its own mistakes and errors.It is just nonsense to suggest that such systems are capable of ‘reasoning’ when it pretends to do so and repeats itself without understanding their own errors.Thus, LLMs and other black-box AIs cannot be trusted for those high risk situations over a consensus of human professionals. reply dwaltrip 18 hours agoparentprevLooking at recent history, things have progressed very quickly in the past 5 years.I expect additional advances at some point in the future. reply bottlepalm 18 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s like watching a baby learn how to talk.. reply yard2010 16 hours agorootparent...and saying it would never replace you in your job because he talks like a baby reply bottlepalm 14 hours agorootparentBabies are so small and weak, no threat to anyone whatsoever. reply SalmoShalazar 6 hours agoparentprevI coincidentally tried to get ChatGPT 4 to give me some chord progressions today.

The comment you provided seems to be discussing a complex issue related to the diplomatic status of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC), using what&#x27;s called the \"Münchhausen trilemma\" as a framework.1A) Is China (PRC) a part of Taiwan (ROC)? 1B) Is China (PRC) an independent and sovereign country? 2A) Is Taiwan (ROC) a part of China (PRC)? 2B) Is Taiwan (ROC) an independent and sovereign country?These are four interconnected questions about the relationship between China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC). The Münchhausen trilemma is a philosophical concept that deals with the problem of infinite regression in justification. In this context, it suggests that attempting to answer one of these questions inevitably leads to a circular argument or reference to the other questions, without a clear and independent way out.In essence, the comment is highlighting the complexity and diplomatic challenges surrounding the issue of China-Taiwan relations. It implies that finding a definitive and universally accepted solution is difficult, and it often results in a deadlock or circular discussions, hence the reference to \"dogmatic abort\" or diplomacy&#x27;s limitations in resolving this matter. reply squigz 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy? reply neoneye2 16 hours agorootparentCute videos about AI alignment here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@RationalAnimationsIIRC some of them also involves politics and AI. reply MichaelMoser123 9 hours agoparentprevis that because of differences in the training set? reply CodeL 9 hours agorootparentCorrect.

The problem really with this is finding not just good questions that do not discriminate individual models but also providing a good sample size (eg not just 60) to get really some meaningful results. And even if you have those, there is a drift in the quality of responses.I&#x27;m the founder of Pulze.ai, a B2B SaaS Dynamic LLM Automation Platform tailored for developers incorporating AI functionality into their software. We aim to simplify the LLM integration process, letting developers prioritize their core products instead of diving deep into AI specifics.We&#x27;ve constructed a scoring system for leading models and continually benchmark them. Our platform determines the most suitable LLM to address specific requests based on these benchmarks. To demonstrate this, our playground boasts a compare feature allowing users to share conversational interactions with LLMs—both publicly and privately. As the context changes, we pinpoint various models for responses. These shared conversations can be forked and extended.Moreover, our extensive API layer isn&#x27;t restricted to these requests; it encapsulates all the essentials for crafting a successful LLM application. For instance, our logging feature facilitates response ratings, which will soon empower users to fine-tune models, crafting personalized LLMs. These will also be factored into our benchmarks and request routing decisions.Concerning the comment on LLM benchmarks, I completely concur. Traditional benchmarks or LLM tricks, like acing a particular test, may not be the most robust indicators since they could&#x27;ve been part of the LLM&#x27;s training set. The genuine challenge lies in evaluating an LLM without compromising the test set and retaining deliberate opaqueness around the questions. Trust issues indeed!Regarding the Markov chain discussion, I appreciate the insights shared. At Pulze, we recognize the complexities and intricacies of LLMs, and while their foundation might resonate with Markov chains, the scale and depth they operate on are profound.We&#x27;ve just emerged from stealth, and I&#x27;d genuinely value any feedback or thoughts on our approach and platform.

An estimated 20 to 40 million tonnes of lithium metal lie within a volcanic crater formed around 16 million years ago. This is notably larger than the lithium deposits found beneath a Bolivian salt flat, previously considered the largest deposit in the world. ‘If you believe their back-of-the-envelope estimation, this is a very, very significant deposit of lithium,’ says Anouk Borst, a geologist at KU Leuven University and the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Belgium. ‘It could change the dynamics of lithium globally, in terms of price, security of supply and geopolitics.’ New in situ analysis reveals that an unusual claystone, composed of the mineral illite, contains 1.3% to 2.4% of lithium in the volcanic crater. This is almost double the lithium present in the main lithium-bearing clay mineral, magnesium smectite, which is more common than illite. Related stories The elements of energy storage The lithium rush The long-term energy storage challenge Some unusual conditions created what could be a uniquely rich volcanic deposit. The crater – the McDermitt caldera – formed 16.4 million years ago when around 1000km3 of magma exploded outwards. The caldera was filled with erupted products of an alkaline magma rich in sodium and potassium, as well as lithium, chlorine and boron. This quickly cooled to form a finely crystalline glassy volcanic rock, ignimbrite, which weathered to produce lithium-rich particles. A lake subsequently formed in the crater, persisting for hundreds of thousands of years, with weathered volcanic and surrounding materials forming a clay-rich sediment at its bottom. The new analysis suggested that, after the lake had emptied, another bout of volcanism exposed the sediments to a hot, alkaline brine, rich in lithium and potassium. Source: © Chris Henry Layers of claystone containing lithium minerals in the McDermitt caldera zoom in zoom out ‘Previous research assumed that the illite was everywhere at depth in the caldera,’ says Thomas Benson, a geologist at Lithium Americas Corporation, and was formed when high temperatures and pressures turned smectite to illite. Benson’s team proposed that a layer of illite around 40m thick was formed in the lake sediments by this hot brine. The fluid moved upwards along fractures formed as volcanic activity restarted, transforming smectite into illite in the southern part of the crater, Thacker Pass. The result was a claystone rich in lithium. ‘This would be a multistep alteration of lithium-bearing smectite to illite, where hydrothermal fluids enriched the clays in potassium, lithium and fluorine,’ says Borst. ‘They seem to have hit the sweet spot where the clays are preserved close to the surface, so they won’t have to extract as much rock, yet it hasn’t been weathered away yet.’ The material could be best described as looking ‘a bit like brown potter’s clay’, says Christopher Henry, emeritus professor of geology at the University of Nevada in Reno. ‘It is extremely uninteresting, except that it has so much lithium in it.’ ‘There’s been a lot of searching for additional [lithium] deposits,’ Henry adds. ‘The United States has just one small lithium-producing brine operation in Nevada.’ Source: © Benson et al., Sci. Adv. 9 (2023) Map showing type and relative size of global lithium resources. Current production is predominantly spodumene from pegmatites in Australia (47%) and brines underlying salt flats in Chile (30%), China (12%), and Argentina (5%) zoom in zoom out Henry does not wholly agree with the newly proposed history of the crater, since isotopic dating showed that a lake existed there until 15.7 million years ago, but the volcanic system went extinct by 16.1 million years. The new timeline would require volcanic activity for longer than the evidence suggests, he explains. Benson says his company expects to begin mining in 2026. It will remove clay with water and then separate out the small lithium-bearing grains from larger minerals by centrifuging. The clay will then be leached in vats of sulfuric acid to extract lithium. ‘If they can extract the lithium in a very low energy intensive way, or in a process that does not consume much acid, then this can be economically very significant,’ says Borst. ‘The US would have its own supply of lithium and industries would be less scared about supply shortages.’ Benson views the lithium-rich claystone at Thacker Pass as ‘unique’ amongst volcanic sedimentary deposits. ‘Smectite clays are relatively more abundant,’ he says. Exploration for further lithium deposits following eruptions should focus on calderas with lake sediments that have been hydrothermally altered in lakes with no outflows, he adds.

    "commentBody": "Lithium discovery in US volcano could be biggest deposit ever foundHacker NewspastloginLithium discovery in US volcano could be biggest deposit ever found (chemistryworld.com) 500 points by jseliger 11 hours ago| hidepastfavorite232 comments panick21_ 10 hours agoAs with all the 5000 news articles talking about lithium discovers, please remember, lithium is very common, discovering it is easy, there is plenty around and plenty of known location.However lithium operates more like a advanced chemical then a base metal. Each mine lithium mine is different and has to be separately qualified for each battery manufactures&#x2F;car company.There are very, very few companies who have actually managed to produce battery grade lithium and many, many company who have been struggling for years to achieve it.We simply don&#x27;t have a lithium problem, what is lacking is the expertise to actually bring deposits like this to use. reply jillesvangurp 2 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s not so much an expertise problem but more a problem of having to tailor the process to the supply of lithium. We&#x27;re talking typically low quantities of lithium mixed with a lot of other materials in either some kind of clay, brine, or rock. Or recycled lithium batteries. Those sources of lithium require different approaches and there are multiple companies working on all of those.Historically, lithium was not interesting to mine at scale until the invention of lithium batteries thirty years ago. And only about ten years ago we figured out that we needed a lot of lithium to power things like cars, trucks, planes and electricity grids.We&#x27;ve only been looking for lithium for a relatively short amount of time. Before we started looking, it was a relatively low value by product of mining other stuff. There&#x27;s this perception that we have to go to places like Bolivia, Australia, etc. because that&#x27;s where the known, easy to access deposits are. But as this article shows, there are probably loads of other places that might have rich lithium deposits.The market for refining lithium is basically expanding at the pace we can build refineries. It&#x27;s apparently a big reason Tesla chose to build their own refinery in Texas because the rest of the industry was not moving quick enough. Supplying lithium to the refinery isn&#x27;t the issue. There&#x27;s plenty of it. And if you start looking, you&#x27;ll find some more. Rich deposits like this are of course nice and rare. The high concentration of lithium means extracting it is relatively cheap. But you can get it out of ocean water, there are natural brines in various places that have it, clay and rock deposits all over the place. By mass, it&#x27;s one of the more common elements on this planet. reply dietr1ch 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d be surprised if the US cannot build the industry necessary for it, and even if that were the case, it seems that they could export ~raw lithium, and then buy it processed, or as batteries if needed meanwhile they figure things out, as the US doesn&#x27;t really want to keep China owning critical production lines for the technology that&#x27;s coming in the next 20+ years. reply panick21_ 8 hours agorootparentHere is the thing. Its not about what can happen in 20+ years. Of course the US can do whatever it want&#x27;s in 20 years with enough money. In 20 years lot of things will be very different.But again, there was already plenty of lithium in the US, this discovery changes nothing. The US already has competent lithium companies.The US already has good relationship with South America and Australia where the resources are coming from. But currently 90%+ of refining is in China.Controlling the &#x27;raw&#x27; resources is mostly uninteresting in this case. reply iancmceachern 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s very similar to aluminum in this way. Aluminum mining is very different than many other minerals and metals. It&#x27;s basically a processing thing. It&#x27;s all about where you can get the resources to do the refining, not where the ore is. In the case of Aluminum its electricity. They call aluminum solidified electricity for a reason. That&#x27;s why the biggest aluminum smelters in the world are where electricity is cheap.Same here, it&#x27;s not like there is big chunks of Lithium just waiting to be picked up. It&#x27;s a small percentage of dirt, and you need to process huge amounts of that dirt to extract it. That processing takes resources. Those resources are the limiting factor, not the raw ore. In the case of aluminum its electricity. In the case of lithium I gather it&#x27;s also energy (to do the heating) and sulfuric acid, and the associated containment snd cleanup of such.Source: \"After the ore is mined, it is crushed and roasted at 2012°F (1100°C). It is then cooled to 140°F (65°C), milled and roasted again, this time with sulfuric acid, at 482°F (250°C), a process known as acid leaching.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sttsystems.com&#x2F;industries&#x2F;lithium-extraction&#x2F;#:~.... reply reacharavindh 6 hours agorootparentInteresting to hear about refining of Aluminium. It is a very useful metal, and if it is electricity intensive to define, I wonder if it would fit the use of excess renewable electricity. A lot of times, UK has excess wind power than they can pass on to any grids that they idle the windmills. Same with countries like Morocco that gets a lot of sun, but not enough transmission lines to push them into(for a lot of geo political reasons, building out transmission lines seem to be a lot complicated).If it could be as simple as “we produced this much aluminium from all the excess energy we had last summer! Go use it in residential construction, shelters, tools, whatever, heck even mounts for further more solar panels” reply qball 4 hours agorootparent>It is a very useful metal, and if it is electricity intensive to define, I wonder if it would fit the use of excess renewable electricity.No, absolutely not. Aluminum refining, like all industrial processes at scale, takes a long time to get going and needs to run (hence be fed electricity) continuously, not just whenever the wind feels like blowing.While it is an excellent business opportunity for electricity that is cheap because it is renewable- and why Canada produces more refined aluminum than any other Western country thanks to its electric generation being overwhelmingly renewable for the entire time it&#x27;s even had a grid- it&#x27;s not something you can turn on and off whenever you want and not a good candidate to burn off excess power (\"just not using as much naturally-pumped stored power\" is not an \"excess\" of power by definition). reply theptip 4 hours agorootparentIf you have a predictable pricing regime can you vary the power load on a diurnal cycle? Say, drawing more at noon and less at 7pm each day? If so it could still be useful to shape the demand curve (ie use power when solar is cheapest so that meeting the evening peak doesn’t require as much overprovisioning) even though this doesn’t help with inter-day variability of supply.The problem I’ve always seen with this sort of plan is that the refinery is extremely expensive and so you don’t want it idle; it’s cheaper to overbuild solar than to turn off your refinery for 25% of the day. But interested if this applies here, maybe the energy-intensive bits can be made cheaply? reply EricE 3 hours agorootparentThese kinds of refineries take *weeks* to start up. There is no idle. Period. reply dtech 2 hours agorootparentHow large is the tolerance though? Would it be feasible to heat things up a little more from say 9:00 - 17:00 and using more electricity so that you don&#x27;t need to heat (as much) during peak demand-supply imbalance? Even a couple of hours can help with the duck curve. reply scrlk 37 minutes agorootparentLooks like aluminium smelter demand flexibility is already in use, but it doesn&#x27;t rely on process temperature variation:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enpot.com&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aluminiuminsider.com&#x2F;trimet-aluminium-betting-enpots... replyiancmceachern 5 hours agorootparentprevMost aluminum for European countries comes from recycled sources.

My understanding is that glassmaking plants, for instance, will literally solidify if they ever stop operation--making it an extremely rare occurrence. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if aluminum refining is the same way--fighting entropy keeping things hot is a losing battle, so not very dispatchable. reply iancmceachern 4 hours agorootparentThat is true about float glass plants but for a different, very interesting reason.Float glass plants work by literally floating a thin sheet of molten glass on top of a giant tank of liquid tin. They have a swimming pool of liquid tin, float molten glass on top, and then push it along the tank length wise.The glass and tin is then gradually cooled until the glass is solidified. It&#x27;s then cut into pieces, cooled and stacked.If the thing suddenly stops, or there is a hiccup of some kind, the thermal expansion of the glass, along with its extreme hardness (lack if strength) it will just shatter the whole mile long sheet of glass. My understanding is that it takes the better part of a year to recover from something like this.In aluminum, its basically electroplating. They basically electroplate the aluminum out of the ore onto the ingots. My understanding is that takes a few weeks to a month to recover from a similar incident. reply speed_spread 5 hours agorootparentprevI confirm that an aluminium refinery is not something you stop lightly. I remember something about taking two weeks to restart? Maybe more. Source, had family working at a large northern plant. reply Filligree 4 hours agorootparentBeing able to restart it at all makes it better than a lot of industries. Many of these liquid-metal affairs depend on convection and inertia to keep the metal molten, and if it solidifies inside a pipe—well, then you don&#x27;t have a pipe anymore; you have a bimetal pole.Or ceramic cladding for an iron pole, depending.Either way it&#x27;s a rebuild, not a restart. reply iancmceachern 2 hours agorootparentTotally, like magnetic induction pumps that pump molten iron, once the iron solidifies its a composite tube. reply jskrablin 3 hours agorootparentprevGlass melting furnace never stops after it&#x27;s started. If it cools down it&#x27;s basically destroyed so yeah, they run uninterrupted for years. Any maintenance or fixes need to account for that. reply Mistletoe 3 hours agorootparentHow do they account for power outages? Huge generators?

The pots[1] in the smelter get their lifetime reduced if they have to be restarted, and if restarted multiple times that can be quite significant[2]. They can survive without power for a few hours, but they freeze over after a day or so which leads to the most damage.As such they really want stable and cheap electricity, like hydro.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aluminium_smelting#Layout_of_a...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aluminiumtoday.com&#x2F;content-images&#x2F;news&#x2F;Oyeweb.pdf reply jandrewrogers 4 hours agorootparentprevEfficiency for industrial chemistry is massively dependent on the processes being continuous. The processes often don’t work, or work poorly, until you reach a stable equilibrium, which can take many hours. An enormous amount of effort is expended to ensure this in real industrial processes. Otherwise, you are just burning resources for negligible output.The idea that we’ll do industrial chemistry with intermittent energy surpluses is unrealistic unless we are okay with yield per unit of energy being very poor relative to continuous processes. reply iancmceachern 2 hours agorootparentExactly. Chemistry can be done that way, in batches.

Aluminum is only \"solidified electricity\" under normal circumstances. Not when capex is 24x because the normal price of electricity in the UK for most of the day is ~7x what you&#x27;d pay in Texas (which isn&#x27;t even that cheap globally) reply Gibbon1 17 minutes agorootparentprevNot Aluminum. However iron can be reduced in a low temperature aqueous cell. I can&#x27;t think of why that couldn&#x27;t be done intermittently. Takes about 3-4kwh per kg of iron produced. That probably works out to $150-250&#x2F;ton.You can also run electric furnaces intermittently because they are inherently a batch process. reply brendoelfrendo 5 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, aluminum refining is a relatively large industry in Iceland for this very reason. Geothermal energy production in excess of what people need means you can devote a bunch to industry cheaply.

Glad to find out for certain that this isn&#x27;t true. reply eru 4 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s easy to set up lithium extraction. The problem is setting up commercially viable lithium extraction.Yes, the US can lose lots of money building a lithium industry. But what would be the point? reply foota 10 hours agoparentprevThis is really interesting, could you explain a little more? Is it that each of these mines is a different lithium compound, and there&#x27;s no economical process to convert it to some base form? reply panick21_ 9 hours agorootparentJust to be clear, I&#x27;m not a chemists. This is just what I have learned from following this industry. Any real domain expert feel free to correct or expand.Lithium comes in many forms, on a high level there are 3, hard rock, clay and brine.Hard rock was initially common, when lithium was new and was mined in North Carolina. It turn out it was cheaper to produce lithium from brines in South America. This basically means pumping salty water from below the earth and using the sun to evaproate the water [2].However since the battery revolution, Australia has been a leading miner of Spodumene [1]. This then shipped to China and turned into lithium chemicals.Clay has not yet been exploited, but many are tying (like Tesla showed in their presentation). Another technology much talked about is Direct Lithium Extraction, that simple extracts lithium and releases slightly less salty water back into the environment.From these mining operations two different chemicals are produced as input for battery cathode refining processes, lithium carbonate [3] and lithium hydroxide [4]. Different methods of mining and refining produce either of those. If my understanding is correct, most brine operations end up being carbonate and most hard rock operations end up as hydroxide. Often hydroxide is also produced from carbonate as a follow up process.Depending on your cathode material and your process you need carbonate or hydroxide of specific quality. And because the material performance here is so important and the battery as a system is so sensitive, even the slight changes in source material and the process can have large impacts. Even the slight changes in source material and the process can have big effects.So that means if you have a mine, you can&#x27;t just mine do minimal refinement and then throw it on to the international standardized metals market the way it works for other materials. You need to build a highly sophisticated chemical processing facility that can handle your material specifically and produce high quality materials in a sufficient quantity that car makers can go threw the many rounds of testing that are required before a new source material ever makes it into a car.Since the lithium industry is comparatively so small the necessary expertise to do these things is not at all common. A few companies can do it and that&#x27;s not very many people. So getting a team together that can pull of a major project like that isn&#x27;t easy.Some media sources that do lot of good reporting:Global Lithium Podcast - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.globallithium.net&#x2F;podcast - Opinion-ed Insider and InterviewsThe Limiting Factor - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@thelimitingfactor&#x2F;videos - Well researched videos on batteries but also lithium supply chains.

They&#x27;re expecting 1400 ppm on 3 Bt. Cores from Lithium Americas&#x27;s inferred 19 Mt LCE find at Thacker Pass on the southern caldera is extracting at 84% on acid leeching. (For context, Clayton Valley&#x27;s brine project converts at 85%.)Jindalee also claims they can also extract lithium phosphate from it and convert it to either carbonate or hydroxide. That&#x27;s cool, but they don&#x27;t really go into the cost of doing that, but I think the point is that it&#x27;s supposedly a very flexible lode.> Since the lithium industry is comparatively so small the necessary expertise to do these things is not at all common. A few companies can do it and that&#x27;s not very many people. So getting a team together that can pull of a major project like that isn&#x27;t easy.GM and POSCO (the Korean cathode active material supplier for GM) are already working with Jindalee on feasibility of exploiting clay at scale, and GM already bought $650M of equity in Lithium Americas back in January for Thacker Pass. Probably know by February&#x2F;March 2024 what the damage will be for processing clay, but Jindalee already expects to know whether they&#x27;ll be shovels-in-ground by June 2024.That is a very fast turnaround for something that hasn&#x27;t really been done before at any scale, much less 30 Mt of LCE-scale. Which I think is also why this article is a bit more focused on whether they can learn enough from how this find came about to make more finds like it. They might not know how to extract clay for a while, but if they can learn how to find more similarly exploitable clay first, they can get more investment to catch up.Inferring >30 Mt of LCE at 1400 ppm from just two sites in one caldera still seems like plenty of reason to fund figuring that out ASAP, though. Clayton Valley is like 6 Mt LCE; at this stage of the process, they were suggesting 1.3 Mt LCE at 900 ppm, on a feasibility target of 400 ppm. That was good enough for $700M in funding. reply defrost 5 hours agorootparentIn reseource development flow Jindalee&#x27;s project is currently midway beteen Final Technical Report (where mining engineers produce a resource estimate of shapes, volumes, and densities) and Economic Feasibility Report (where production engineers sketch out one or several methods to get material out cheaper than the market value of the material)See: Preferred Lithium Extraction Process for McDermitt Project (24th March 2023)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;announcements.asx.com.au&#x2F;asxpdf&#x2F;20230324&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;45mzrdq...It&#x27;s part of the listing standards on mineral exchanges (such as the Canadian TSX, the Australian ASX, etc) that various levels of reports at various levels of accuracy be filed by independant third party mineral engineers.The fascicle published above is a brief four pager outlining to investors where on track they are for now - expect within 12 months or so a meaty 400+ technical report rehasing the work that has gone into estimation and additional work outling scaled up extraction plans .. closely followed by an IPOProspectus to raise money for capital plant equipment for the project and potential spawning of a new sub company and listing. reply natmaka 7 hours agorootparentprevIndeed!

It might still be vital for your country&#x27;s future to subsidise renewables, but it doesn&#x27;t follow from the observation.If China wants to spend taxpayer money to give foreigners cheaper renewables (or cheaper anything), that&#x27;s nice of them, but doesn&#x27;t mean anyone should imitate them.If you have insufficient local workers for a task, and you are the US, you can always open the floodgates of (skilled) migration.Also you don&#x27;t need to subsidize renewables. That&#x27;s a sore game of trying to pick winners and introducing extra bureaucracy. Instead you can hit the same policy goals simpler by taxing fossil fuels (or carbon emissions). Distribute the proceeds amongst all voters, if you want it to be revenue neutral.With a tax, someone can react by just driving less (eg by moving closer to work) and benefiting from that choice.

You are unlikely to change the big battery in your Tesla on your own, so that isn’t a problem.Battery recycling is really just a logistics problem. reply barkingcat 6 hours agorootparentIn Canada at least, when you buy a car &#x2F; ev battery depending on the chemistry you get a coupon that you redeem for a significant amount of money when you take your old replaced battery back to the place you bought the new battery.

Just use energy to turn air and water back into fuel, boom cycle closed.What matters is not if something is &#x27;renewable&#x27; but if its a strategically correct thing to do in regards to climate and energy security.Calling lithium &#x27;renwable&#x27; is ridiculous.

The end to end efficiency of that process (Hydrolysis, CO2 capture, Fischer Tropf) would likely measure in the single digit percentages. Charging a car battery (especially from local solar) can be over 90% efficient.When you include the very low tank to wheels efficiency of an ICE vehicle, the overall efficiency is even worse. reply scythe 6 hours agorootparentprevThat isn&#x27;t really \"renewing\", though. If part of the process involves the substance being dispersed in the environment and then extracted again, that&#x27;s different from capturing waste as it&#x27;s produced. Furthermore, you&#x27;re not necessarily capturing the same carbon dioxide that you released, but when you recycle a battery, it&#x27;s the same lithium. And getting the lithium from a battery should take less energy than mining it, while capturing and reducing carbon dioxide definitely requires more energy than pumping oil from the ground.So I don&#x27;t think this analogy holds up. reply iancmceachern 7 hours agorootparentprevSo is lithiumSince I&#x27;m being down voted, I&#x27;m adding a reference:5% of lithium batteries are currently recycled https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cas.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;cas-insights&#x2F;sustainability&#x2F;li....So, not renewable reply gibolt 6 hours agorootparentWhile the 5% number may be presently accurate, it is mainly for tiny Lithium batteries.

I am not sure though, if it would make commercial sense even then: you can make batteries (and other gadgets) without lithium, and for many applications you can make do without batteries at all.Eg instead of solely driving electric cars with home-grown lithium batteries, on the margin I would expect more people to take the train. reply nonethewiser 5 hours agorootparentprev> If one was going to be paranoidWhether or not its paranoia is the issue so you can’t presuppose it.

Seems like a common problem for resource extraction that gets solved with time and investment. reply Turskarama 9 hours agorootparentOne of the biggest differences is that oil is all _primarily_ the same stuff and the difficulty is pulling out impurities. This means it can be quite cost effective to ship it where it needs to go to be processed. Crude oil is considered sour for example if it contains 1-2% sulfur. Ores on the other hand are usually mostly not the actual mineral you&#x27;re looking for, and you&#x27;re lucky if you&#x27;re hitting double digit percentage concentrations, Lithium being \"high concentration\" if you&#x27;re reaching 6%. This means that you ideally need to be doing most of (and usually all) of the processing at or very near the mine. One of the only minerals we regularly ship raw ore of is iron, since it tends to be in relatively high concentrations. Some Lithium mines might ship some ore but this is usually only done as an initial source of revenue while the processing is being built.The end result of this is that it&#x27;s harder to take advantage of economies of scale where you can have a handful of processing facilities working on a very specific type of ore. reply seanmcdirmid 9 hours agorootparentSo all of that Australian lithium being shipped off to China, is it being mostly processed in Australia first, or is most of the processing done in China, or something half half?The main reason America develops great oil tech and not lithium tech vs China is that the USA has lots of oil, while China doesn’t. reply Turskarama 6 hours agorootparentA lot of it is sent as partially processed ore, but two major reasons for that are: 1) a lot of these mines are very new and 2) Australia in particular is _very bad_ at secondary industries. We have a long history of just sending our minerals and raw food ingredients overseas to be processed and are lacking in expertise.Here is a recent article about this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;23&#x2F;business&#x2F;australia-lithiu... reply panick21_ 9 hours agorootparentprevIts not that different from oil.

A new discovery will take 10 year minimum before it can be ready, more likely 20. So discoveries like this aren&#x27;t gone do anything.There are some domestic companies further along in the process. But existing sources like South American brine and Australian hard rock will continue to be a huge part of the market.The US companies that originally mined in North Carolina are still around on the processing side.So its not really clear if having the mining domestically makes much of a difference. China is refining mostly things from Australia.Tesla is setting up a huge lithium refining factory on US soil but most of the material won&#x27;t be mined in the US. reply mkoubaa 9 hours agoparentprevSo then if prices of battery-grade lithium go up enough then it&#x27;ll incentivize new production techniques? reply panick21_ 9 hours agorootparentThere are various different compound of lithium at different qualities that count as &#x27;battery grade&#x27;. That is what makes the market so complex.But generally speaking yes, there are 100s of junior lithium miners and all the big miners as well engaged in lithium extraction.Clay is as of yet untouched in mass production of lithium with many companies wanting to exploit it.Maybe most common is research on DLE, lithium extraction from brine where the brine is simply pumped back.

It will remove clay with water and then separate out the small lithium-bearing grains from larger minerals by centrifuging. The clay will then be leached in vats of sulfuric acid to extract lithium. reply greggsy 9 hours agoparentThis sounds very similar to uranium refinement.How economical is the refinement of lithium clays compared to stone or brine mines? Do they have similar chemical, water and mechanical refinement requirements? reply Roark66 2 hours agoprevHow these two sentences are in any way compatible with eachother:>company will (..) separate out the small lithium-bearing grains from larger minerals by centrifuging. The clay will then be leached in vats of sulfuric acid to extract lithium.And:>‘If they can extract the lithium in a very low energy intensive way, or in a process that does not consume much acid, then this can be economically very significant,’Centrifuging doesn&#x27;t seem to be a very low energy process compared with what they do in Bolivia (just let the water evaporate in huge shallow lakes then gather the material with dozers). And the acid thing is just contradictory. They plan to leach with sulphuric acid and hope to find a way to not use acid at the same time?It is very good more lithium deposits are found outside China, but isn&#x27;t lithium one of most abundant things on earth? And isn&#x27;t the key difficulty in economic extraction the fact established mines use practices that would not be allowed in places like US&#x2F;Europe?Surely, we should start with funding r&d to come up with an economic and less polluting process of extraction. reply georgeburdell 10 hours agoprev(The volcano is dormant) reply jandrewrogers 10 hours agoparentNot dormant, extinct.

And in theory it can then be recycled. reply _ph_ 10 hours agorootparentNot only in theory, but quite practically. The technology exists, but awaits the time when there are a lot of old batteries to recycle. reply dharmab 10 hours agorootparentAwaits? There are battery recycling plants running profitably right now that recover 95% of lithium. reply Tagbert 8 hours agorootparentThose companies will usually explain that those are pilot plants. They don’t have enough volume to really scale to economical production, yet. They’ll need for a lot more EVs to be on the road long enough for batteries to be damaged or fail and need to be recycled. Until recently, the number of new EVs was very low, just single digit percentage of car sales. Now that they are getting into double digits, the potential supply of batteries is starting to grow. It will just take time, now. reply echelon 10 hours agorootparentprev> I think the difference is that lithium is being created into a reusable product while oil is mostly made into a consumable, used once.Sourcing lithium is something we&#x27;ve been thinking a lot about, whereas we haven&#x27;t reached peak fossil fuels or scarcity. There are plenty of places to continue drilling: the US, Greenland, the Arctic Circle, Antarctica ...The problem with fossil fuels is the carbon entering the atmosphere. reply bluGill 10 hours agorootparentTypically we reached peak of some type of energy because the world switched to something else. Granted whales were in danger of being hunted to extinction when the world switched to oil lamps, but it isn&#x27;t clear that was the reason the world switched. reply nerdponx 10 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, \"peak oil\" was a big scare at one point. reply nostrademons 10 hours agorootparentArguably we reached peak oil in 2019:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;265203&#x2F;global-oil-produc...It&#x27;s hard to extrapolate a trend though - there was a dip caused by COVID, and global oil use has been growing since then, but it&#x27;s still not back to where it was 4 years ago.Also a lot of people think peak oil means that we suddenly won&#x27;t have any gas available. No. Peak oil means all the easily extractable oil is gone, and so all future projects need to use more capital-intensive, technologically-advanced extraction techniques that cost more, and so the price of oil goes up, and then we use less of it while it&#x27;s replaced by other technologies. Which is exactly what&#x27;s been happening for the past ~5-15 years. U.S. is back to being the world&#x27;s top oil producer, but all of it is in shale oil fields that aren&#x27;t economically viable below ~$50&#x2F;barrel, and so gas will never go back down to the $1&#x2F;gallon it was in the 90s. reply panick21_ 10 hours agorootparentThere are many different definition of &#x27;Peak oil&#x27; but anybody that thinks this is all because of technology is just wrong.The OPEC countries could produce far more oil far cheaper, but they don&#x27;t want to. There are plenty of oil fields left. Not to mention fighting economic war against Iran and Russia, two huge producers. reply ddingus 10 hours agorootparentprevThat should continue to be a scare.It is likely we are or have peaked.The way I see it, we bootstrapped our existing tech off high energy density oil.If it were gone, we would find it extremely difficult to repeat it all.Now that we have built all this up, it is also our opportunity to bootstrap something far more sustainable, or we do risk a serious regression and a lot of people die.Longer term, we use oil for far too much.Getting off of it preserves a resource we may well find need of again. reply walleeee 9 hours agorootparentIt is especially maddening that our fossil inheritance, dipped into with wisdom and in moderation, could have been a profound and lasting gift for all future life on earth, instead of threatening its very existence. The dose makes the poison reply anonylizard 6 hours agorootparentprevTechnology generally speaking only moves forward. Some technologies will be lost in a civilizational collapse, but the most important ones generally survive.If another collapse happens, and without oil, people could believably bootstrap straight from electricity + batteries. There&#x27;ll be endless amounts of quality scrap material and manuals.

Or, could you say what mechanism you&#x27;re thinking of here? reply bliteben 10 hours agorootparentPhotosynthesis turns carbon and energy into plants immediately.Longer term the same processes that turned algae and other life forms into oil are still happening and try as we might we aren&#x27;t going to stop them, but they proceed at what is likely a pace that will take long after humans are extinct to replenish what we have used. reply margalabargala 9 hours agorootparent> Longer term the same processes that turned algae and other life forms into oil are still happeningThis is unfortunately not true.The vast majority of our fossil fuels are formed from carbon that was sequestered into cellulose in plants, before anything had evolved the ability to digest cellulose. It piled up, and eventually compressed into coal. Look up the ʾCarboniferous Period\" for more details.These reserves are no longer being formed because we have fungi that break down these materials and return the CO2 to the air.Planet Earth will never again have oil and coal reserves of the size it did 200 years ago. reply alexvoda 9 hours agorootparentI was just about to reply the same but I think what you said is true for coal but not necessarily so for oil. reply sanderjd 8 hours agorootparentprevAh I see what you were trying to get at. Seems a bit beside the point, but sure. replygrepfru_it 10 hours agorootparentprevHydrocarbons can be recycled reply sanderjd 10 hours agorootparentTell me more. reply bluGill 10 hours agorootparentPlastics can be recycled. We also know how to put them in various other reactors to make synthetic hydrocarbons.The above processes are costly, but we know how to do it. reply sanderjd 10 hours agorootparentAh I see. I didn&#x27;t think either of the parent comments were talking about plastics. Is most oil turned into recycled plastics? I assumed that most oil is turned into combustible fuel, but maybe that&#x27;s not true. reply lazide 9 hours agorootparentSeems like 8-12% is turned into plastics. Though it’s usually natural gas that is used, not oil directly. Natural gas is also used to produce fertilizer and explosives in large quantities. reply sanderjd 8 hours agorootparentBut I think fertilizer and explosives are also not recyclable. reply lazide 6 hours agorootparentThat depends on your definition I guess. They both do add a lot of nitrogen (and some carbon) to the atmosphere when ‘used’. reply sanderjd 5 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m struggling to figure out what definition of \"recyclable\" fits what you said. What definition are you thinking of? reply lazide 5 hours agorootparentI’m guessing I misread what you wrote and got the sense backwards. replyjaggederest 10 hours agorootparentprevMultiply the number of MTBF cycles times the battery capacity. Every battery is consumable, every time you draw current from it, they&#x27;re not tanks full of liquid, they&#x27;re chemistry.That being said they&#x27;re astronomically more efficient than even an ideal carnot engine. reply Retric 10 hours agorootparentA completely used up battery contains the same amount of lithium, cobalt, etc it took to manufacture it. The only question is the economics around mining vs recycling.An easier to recycle battery that had very slightly fewer charge cycles could be a net win. For scale this depot has enough lithium for ~10 billion of EV’s using Tesla’s battery chemistry and pack size as a benchmark. How expensive it is to extract is however unknown. reply _ph_ 10 hours agorootparentprevThe materials a battery is composed of almost completly can be recycled into a new battery. So creating a new battery requires some work and energy, but not new components. reply xorbax 10 hours agorootparentprevI wasn&#x27;t aware that using a battery destroyed the lithium reply fallingknife 9 hours agorootparentOnly if it&#x27;s a fusion battery! reply mulmen 10 hours agoparentprevIt has happened with all resources. I won’t assume your intent but you invoked oil so I do want to point out the difference.In a battery lithium is not consumed completely after every use like oil. The lithium in a battery is used hundreds or thousands of times. When the pack is dead it can still be downcycled and eventually the individual cells recycled. With the lithium being recovered and reused.Yes, there is or will be a “lithium rush”.

I get it we’re excited to have electric cars but boy oh boy are we going to dig up a lot of shit to get them. reply SketchySeaBeast 10 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t understand this criticism. You mine lithium once. You have to pull fossil fuels out of the ground constantly even after you build the car using iron you&#x27;ve mined out of the ground. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentIf you’ve driven along the gulf coast the cost of oil is obvious. Growing up it was beautiful view of glistening water under a beautiful sky. Now it’s a post industrial view of oil platforms as far as the eye can see. Where fracking happens there’s earthquakes in geologically stable areas. Etc. Lithium extraction isn’t for the light hearted, but the deposits aren’t as vastly dispersed and extraction and processing happens in a smaller foot print. (Unless you consider extracting from ocean water, but even then the industrial footprint is contained) oil extraction is sprawling and pervasive, and once a well dries up, become discarded blight. reply acdha 10 hours agorootparentprevThere’s also a function of scale: the amount of lithium in a car battery is orders of magnitude less than the amount of oil a non-EV will burn over the same lifetime, and even if you’re buying fossil fuel electricity the greater efficiency means you’re still using less. reply grepfru_it 10 hours agorootparentprevAnd how much fossil fuels are required to pull the lithium out of the ground?I don’t have the answer I’m just helping you understand the criticism reply dessimus 10 hours agorootparentProbably no more than is used finding, drilling, extracting new petroleum wells. Especially as we seem to have already gotten to a lot of the &#x27;easily&#x27; accessible crude oil, and are drilling in Arctic and Deep Sea environments. reply devnulll 10 hours agorootparentprevSeems like a sunlight rich area such as the Nevada high desert is about as energy friendly as one could imagine. The main requirements seem to be water, sulfuric acid, and (of course) power. reply panick21_ 9 hours agorootparentprevIt very much depends. There are many different ways of mining lithium.An Australian hard rock mine will use the same amount of fossil fuel as any other hard rock mine.Brine operations don&#x27;t use much but the lithium still has to be transported from a desert.Future technology such as DLE (Direct Lithium Extraction) have to potential to require basically no fossil fuels at all. reply 0xDEF 1 hour agorootparentprevThese type of questions are not serious. This person already knows it&#x27;s just a tiny fraction of what a non-EV vehicle will burn throughout its lifetime.Just downvote, flag, and move on. reply ChatGTP 10 hours agorootparentprevPeople are weird, I think fossil fuel is idiotic too. reply nerdponx 10 hours agorootparentprevHow much of the lithium in a typical electric car battery is able to be extracted and put into another battery? reply sanderjd 10 hours agorootparentI think the answer for \"able to be\" is 100%. I think the question is how economical we can make it to separate it from the rest of the materials and then process it into a new battery.I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll never be able to get back 100% cost effectively, but I&#x27;m sure someday people will be working on driving it as close to that as they can. reply wyager 10 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, petroleum extraction is minimally invasive. You can easily live with an oil well on your property. You can&#x27;t live with a lithium mine on your property. reply _ph_ 2 hours agorootparentIn some places, where it is still possible to use classic wells to pump oil. But in most locations, these have become rare. That we still can extract way too much oil is due to technologies like fracking, oil sands and what else. So claiming petroleum extraction is minimal invasive is a gross misrepresentation. reply panick21_ 9 hours agorootparentprevNot sure what you are talking about, it highly depends on the way lithium is extracted.A lithium hard rock mine is like any other open pid mine. Its a big hole in the ground with trucks going up and down.A brine operations is basically a bunch of huge fields of water that just sort of sit there. It needs lots of space.New forms of DLE Deep Brine mines look very much like a petroleum extraction well (even using old holes from that). However not fully commercial yet.However I would also say that petroleum extraction on a large scale, specially in the ocean has lots of bad effects. And the gas from those mines will escape for decades. reply Tagbert 8 hours agorootparentprevAs other have pointed out, the amount of lithium that needs to be extracted is much smaller than the amount of oil that is already being extracted.An EV battery will use around 8-16kg of lithium that should last for the life of the car. Then the battery can be recycled. Current recycling programs can recover around 95% of the lithium. Over time, the demand for lithium will reach a much lower volume than oil. reply Gibbon1 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s always a good idea to just flat out compare the mass of alternatives.A tank of gasoline weighs more than the lithium in an EV battery. The entire battery weighs as much as 10 tanks of gas. And 20 some kg of lithium is way less than the 1000kg of steel that goes into making a car. reply bluGill 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy not? The process doesn&#x27;t look that bad. reply almost_usual 10 hours agoparentprevThe article made this extraction sound pretty trivial compared to other lithium deposits. The clay is close to the surface and won’t require significant mining.> ‘They seem to have hit the sweet spot where the clays are preserved close to the surface, so they won’t have to extract as much rock, yet it hasn’t been weathered away yet.’> Benson says his company expects to begin mining in 2026. It will remove clay with water and then separate out the small lithium-bearing grains from larger minerals by centrifuging. The clay will then be leached in vats of sulfuric acid to extract lithium. reply lifechoseme123 9 hours agoparentprevThus far, one comment brought up an Environment perspective, and it gets downvoted.How shameful, from this audience which supposedly leans left. Where is the concern for the environment?I&#x27;m a conservative, and an environmentalist.But my goodness... I&#x27;d expect this liberal forum to not downvote a person who mentions that perhaps we should consider the impact on the local environment. reply panick21_ 9 hours agorootparentBecause lithium extraction such a tiny aspect of everything, and replacing a huge and evil oil industry that has terrible effects on everything is like comparing an apple to an F-150.One is so clearly worse that its not even really worth debating. And that&#x27;s why very often the &#x27;but what about lithium effect on the environment&#x27; is often broad up by car and oil lobbyist to gaslight people. That is the reason the person got downvoted.But if want to know, lithium mining is a worse basically like mining any other hard rocket, cooper or whatever. There are some issues with brine mining but they are minor and very localized. As with all mining there is issues with local representation. reply Tagbert 8 hours agorootparentprevYou should understand that there is a lot of astroturfing going on now with comments starting that EVs and batteries are terribly toxic and will be an huge environmental disaster. Those people never seem to acknowledge the counter arguments. Batteries use only a small amount of lithium (8-16kg per vehicle). There is some toxicity to lithium mining but it is not a particularly toxic element and the effects are localized. Once produced, the lithium in batteries can be recycled efficiently. We are not going to need millions of lithium mines.The amount needed is a couple of orders of magnitude less than the amount of drilling sites needed for the toxic oil that we are current extracting and burning and that cannot be recycled in any meaningful way.We are concerned for the environment and need to make trade offs to get the best outcome for the environment. So far, the small amount of lithium mines seems like a good trade off against large numbers of oil drills. reply 0xDEF 1 hour agorootparentprevYou are concern trolling. The negative effects of lithium mining and refining is completely trivial compared to the increasingly uninhabitable planet that more CO2 emissions will lead to. reply aa_is_op 10 hours ago[flagged]| prevnext [2 more] Watch China blow a fuse! reply dang 10 hours agoparentCould you please stop posting unsubstantive comments and flamebait?

    "originBody": "HOME DEEP DIVES MOCS INTERVIEWS COMMUNITY CONTESTS BUILD SWAG ABOUT SEARCH Every Type of Plastic Used By LEGO Dave Schefcik Best of BrickNerd - Article originally published May 20, 2022. Today’s guest article comes from Ryan Howerter, one of the LEGO fan community’s foremost color and materials enthusiasts. Their color guide is one of our go-to LEGO references here at BrickNerd, and you can follow them on Flickr, Instagram and Patreon. A Plethora of Plastics Most people know that most LEGO bricks are made of ABS, but that’s not the only plastic that LEGO uses! Historically and currently, LEGO bricks are made with a variety of materials depending on the use case. This article will explore many of them, with a brief overview of their properties and when/how they have been used. Disclaimer: I am only a LEGO enthusiast, not a plastics specialist by any means. If anything here seems wrong or misleading, please do let me know and I will gladly correct it! Also note that within each plastic category, there is the potential for additives and colorants that may further affect how the part performs. Most of the plastics below are really names for families of hundreds of subtly different plastics. LEGO’s exact plastic formulations are trade secrets, and for good reason. Much of this article was informed by The LEGO Group’s own materials webpage as well as hobbyist researchers such as Gary Istok, Bailey Fullarton, and others. All images are my own unless noted otherwise. CA (Cellulose Acetate) CA is a moderately hard thermoplastic (a plastic that softens when heated and hardens when cooled). It can have very glossy, vibrant coloration, and good transparency, but it doesn’t hold its color over time as well as other plastics. The very first LEGO bricks in 1949 were made from CA, and this use continued through the Town Plan and Samsonite eras. However, over time CA has a tendency to warp, often severely. Many of these bricks are now incompatible with modern bricks due to this deformation. LEGO switched to ABS around 1963, and fully phased CA out by 1970. HIPS (High Impact Polystyrene) Polystyrene is a very durable plastic, used for some early bricks (PRIMA, waffle plates) and modern baseplates. Despite its impact resistance, it can be brittle, and has a tendency to turn white along the edges as it wears (see the factory-cut edge of the baseplate pictured, and play-worn Minitalia bricks). Older polystyrene bricks have a very high-pitched, glassy sound when dropped. I believe LEGO now adds a rubber additive to HIPS to increase its strength and flexibility, as well as decrease the whitening effect. Bakelite (Polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride)* Bakelite is a trademarked name and the world’s first synthetic plastic. Unlike thermoplastics like CA and ABS, Bakelite is a thermoset, meaning that once the resin has hardened it cannot be remolded. It is heat-resistant and inflexible, as well as very shiny and slightly translucent. These bricks were produced for LEGO by the Swedish company Geas Konstharts from 1950–1953, before they rebranded as PRIMA and switched to a polystyrene, which was likely cheaper to produce and had more coloration potential. *At least, this is the current AFOL historian consensus for these Geas bricks. From my limited readings, it seems they may more likely be Catalin or Beetle, given the consistent bright colors and slight translucency. ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) ABS is a strong, stable, scratch-resistant thermoplastic, and makes up the vast majority of LEGO pieces since 1963. It is a translucent-milky color when uncolored, so it cannot be used for transparent parts. LEGO used to receive their raw ABS granules from Bayer, which has a long history of testing 2x4 bricks for LEGO in unusual colors and molds. In 2004 Bayer’s ABS division became Lanxess, which now provides LEGO with ABS under the brand name Novodur (colored with Lanxess’s Macrolex dyes). SAN (Styrene-Acrylonitrile Resin) SAN is a very clear, glassy plastic often used for inexpensive drinkware. It is rigid and strong, but can turn yellow over time. Its clarity makes it great for prisms, and I believe LEGO also used it for windscreens from the 70 to early 90s. PP (Polypropylene) Polypropylene is a tough, flexible plastic, used for most Bionicle weapons and minifigure parts that might break easily if they were a more rigid plastic. The plastic’s flexibility allows for it to be used as a “living hinge”, as in the book pictured here. Because it cannot be fully transparent, colors like 48 Transparent Green (pictured) look nearly opaque in PP, sometimes being mistaken for their solid counterpart color. PP often turns whitish along the edges as it wears. It is used for as varied applications as large buckets and pick-a-brick cups, and even the polybags that parts and small sets come in! PC (Polycarbonate) Polycarbonate is a strong material that can be very clear. I believe that PC replaced CA for transparent parts at the same time that ABS replaced CA for opaque parts in 1963. The vast majority of transparent parts in LEGO’s history are made of PC — but around 2019, LEGO switched to MABS, so PC is now only used for opaque parts like hinges and joints. Transparent PC tends to bond to itself when connected tightly, which is why it’s so difficult to remove a transparent cone from a 4L bar, and PC minifigures only exist as rare delicate prototypes. The PC LEGO uses is Lanxess’s Makrolon. MABS (Methyl Methacrylate-Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene) This thermoplastic offers high strength and impact resistance, though not quite as strong as standard ABS. But unlike ABS, MABS offers high transparency and can display very bright transparent colors and glitter effects. Since around 2018, LEGO has switched to using MABS for most transparent parts (possibly because PC uses BPA, which is increasingly regulated by the EU—read more about the transition in this BrickNerd article). It tends to look slightly milkier than older transparent parts, but I believe this is improving as LEGO continues to refine the material. PA (Polyamide) Polyamide, or nylon, is a very strong plastic that holds up against high impact, lending itself to connectors and gears, even in non-LEGO machinery, where durability is more important than perfect coloration. LEGO used nylon as far back as the 1960s for flexible vehicle couplings (pictured right), although today most of these have hardened and are very brittle. Modern Technic bricks with pins, such as 42929, are dual-molded so the brick part is ABS and the pin is PA (this is why they show up in BrickSet as “multicombination”, even though it’s the same color throughout). POM (Polyoxymethylene) Also known as acetal, POM offers high stability and low friction, like PA. POM is more pliable, making it suitable for long axles that need to be able to flex a little without breaking. TP (Thermoplastic Polyester) TP is a broad category of materials, including PET, that are strong and can be very transparent. In LEGO, it is both tougher than PC (so the thin fire doesn’t snap) and softer than ABS (so the brick separator is less likely to damage other bricks). Fun fact, older separators were made out of HV-PC instead, so you might have both varieties in your collection. PE (Polyethylene) Polyethylene is a very common thermoplastic with low strength and rigidity, and a low melting point. Its relative flexibility makes it perfect for large thin parts like leaves and stems. On the left in the photo above are high-density polyethylene (HDPE), while the right two parts are low-density polyethylene (LDPE): the lower the density, the softer it is. PE is a very versatile plastic — the thin plastic in LEGO store shopping bags is LDPE, and some carry cases that have a living hinge are HDPE. In 2018, LEGO started sourcing their PE from 98% sugarcane (the two small leaves pictured), as part of their long-term sustainability plan. Although the source is different, the end product is, in theory, identical. MTPO (Metallocene Thermoplastic Polyolefin) MTPO is a very soft material that LEGO uses for parts that need to bend sharply without being damaged. I wasn’t able to find much information on this material, but it seems it’s a variant of TPO, a category of thermoplastics blended with elastomers. TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) TPU is a very strong but elastic thermoplastic, perfect for uses where repeated flexing might wear out a weaker material. LEGO uses this for Dots and VIDIYO straps, but also other semiflexible parts like DUPLO dog ears. TPU is harder and stronger than MTPO. SEBS (Styrene-Ethylene-Butylene-Styrene) SEBS is a thermoplastic that behaves like rubber, without needing vulcanization. LEGO uses this for tires — and, famously, LEGO makes most of the tires in the world, by number if not by mass! I believe that LEGO used to make their tires out of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), which is less stable and heat-resistant than SEBS. PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) IMAGE VIA LEGO No photo here, sorry. PET, a type of polyester, is a versatile plastic used for water bottles (among a myriad of other items including fabrics and electronics). LEGO currently uses PET for thermoformed clamshell packages such as Build-a-Minifig packages and comic con promos. LEGO has been prototyping actual bricks in this plastic, due to its readily recyclable nature (when not thermoformed), but none have been released publicly just yet. Other Materials As any LEGO fan knows, not all parts are plastic. LEGO has used all sorts of metals, fabrics, foams, rubber bands, and even wood to complete their sets, giving play functionality, textures, and motion that plastic alone couldn’t. The Future of Plastics That’s all the plastics LEGO has used that I’m aware of — far more than I thought when I started, and I’m certain I haven’t caught all of them! In 2015, LEGO announced plans to invest 1 billion DKK (~$150m USD) in developing new sustainable materials for their products over the following 15 years, kicking off with the 2016 opening of their LEGO Sustainable Materials Centre in Billund. In 2018, the first plant-sourced polyethylene parts started appearing in sets. By 2020, plastic shopping bags were being phased out in LEGO stores. And in late 2020, LEGO announced that they were massively reinforcing their sustainability plan, investing $400m USD to replace all packaging with sustainable materials (as well as other “social responsibility initiatives”). Paper bags are already replacing plastic bags inside sets this year. So what becomes of ABS, the plastic that accounts for around 80% of LEGO’s production? LEGO has tested “over 250 variations of PET”, as well as hundreds of other plastics — a New Elementary article mentions test bricks made from corn, algae, and wheat! But as of now, no final replacement has been announced, and the vast majority of LEGO parts remain fossil-fuel-based. I look forward to seeing what LEGO comes up with by 2030, and given our present climate crisis, it can’t come soon enough. A Palatable Postscript IMAGE VIA CANDY BLOX Just for fun, what are some materials that LEGO hasn’t used for building bricks? We’ve seen wooden bricks from Eco-Bricks and Mokulock, even as early as Halsam’s American Bricks in 1939. Various brands have made a variety of metal bricks as desk toys for adults. Minibrix and Bild-O-Brik, arguably the very first building toys with a stud-and-tube concept, used hard rubber bricks in the mid-1930s. Hilary Page’s Kiddicraft used urea-formaldehyde along with Bakelite for their toys. I have a 2x4 brick made of corn-based PLA (I wish I knew who made it) — not only bio-sourced but biodegradable too! The company Bio-On has been testing sustainable bricks made from PHA. Batima, a brand from 1930s Belgium, made bricks from Galalith, which comes from casein (milk protein) — not edible, unlike Candy Blox, which are made from compressed dextrose!

I remember hearing about major disruptions to resin manufacturers in 2021 when the state of Texas experienced very cold temperatures. This led to high prices for plastic plumbing pipe but I’m not sure how it might have affected Lego. We have a number of sets from that era that have had a high number of cracked bricks. Lego’s excellent customer service has replaced them of course, but I’m curious why this might have happened.

They just want a model of the Millennium Falcon, to display on their shelf; and the one that best optimizes appearance + affordability for them, just happens to be one that comes as a kit of small modular parts that they must assemble.

It’ll change colors, make plastics brittle, and even introduce some warping. Then come heat and oxygen. Obviously some materials are more susceptible to chemical damage than others; ABS is very prone to breaking down even from exposure to weak solvents while PET is ridiculously solvent-resistant.Storing old bricks with new shouldn’t really matter. ABS off gases but mainly when heated. Most damage to ABS is irreversible. It’s not a great long-term material and it has many shortcomings. reply bboygravity 7 hours agorootparentAnecdote about how badly ABS ages: I have a 30+ year old car and all the parts on it are fine EXCEPT everything made from ABS.After this long inside a car (little UV exposure I&#x27;m guessing, but lots of heat exposure) the strength of 1 to 2 mm thick ABS is \"empty egg shell\" strength. Really really brittle. reply shortcake27 2 hours agoparentprevStore tyres separately. I have tyres from the 90s that are fine. But tyres from the 2000s started melting after ~10 years. I don’t know a lot about rubber but I guess they switched from natural rubber to petroleum-based rubber. Problem with the melty tyres is that they also damage any pieces they’re touching, so it can ruin a set. reply Ma8ee 13 hours agoparentprevI’ve recently unpacked my own childhoods Lego, and most pieces are like new even after 40 years. Some white pieces are a bit yellow, but it’s inconsistent, so I suspect that happened by laying in the sun before it all was packed away. The battery boxes seems to have become a bit brittle.The lego has been stored in cardboard boxes first in the attic in my parents house, and after that in miscellaneous cellars and then an attic again. reply Waterluvian 21 hours agoprevI never really thought about it much. But I guess this is why my baseplates from childhood want to shatter when bent and my kids just want to bend and go white? Or is that really just a function of time and not material? reply derefr 18 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s a function of time. \"Plasticizers\", the chemicals that make plastics varying degrees of bendable†, sweat out of the plastic over time, turning the plastic stiff&#x2F;brittle [which is really what plastics are like by default with no plasticizer in them] and the plastic&#x27;s surface layer either oily or tacky, depending on the particular plastic. (The surface gets oily for \"hard plastics\", and tacky for \"soft-touch\" plastics. If you&#x27;ve ever touched a 40-year-old Apple keyboard cable, you know what soft-touch plastic with the plasticizer sweated out feels like.)† Which ironically makes \"plasticizers\" actually elasticizers. Plastics are polymers named for how they undergo plastic deformation — \"bending and going white\", as you say — at pretty low stress levels. \"Plasticizers\" are ironically chemicals that make plastics into materials that undergo elastic deformation — flopping around without damage — instead. reply feedsmgmt 18 hours agorootparentAren&#x27;t some of those plasticizers and dyes toxic? reply Hackbraten 17 hours agorootparentThey sure are. The German word for elasticizer – Weichmacher (literally “soft-maker”) – has acquired a negative connotation over the years. Colloquially, it’s now kind of synonymous to toxic stuff in plastics. reply userbinator 16 hours agoprevAs someone who liked to push my Lego creations to the limit when I was very young, the smell of friction-overheated ABS is very familiar to me. reply SCUSKU 16 hours agoparentWhat types of things were you building?

Bummer but I hope they keep pushing. reply beloch 20 hours agoparentUsing fossil fuels to grow food, move things and people around, etc. all puts CO2 and other pollutants directly into the atmosphere. Using it to make lego, on the other hand, is comparatively benign.If they can come up with a replacement plastic that has a lower environmental impact, that&#x27;d be great. However, they shouldn&#x27;t use a less environmentally friendly alternative just because it&#x27;s not based on fossil fuels. That would just be greenwashing. reply pmorici 52 minutes agorootparent“I look forward to seeing what LEGO comes up with by 2030, and given our present climate crisis, it can’t come soon enough.”I was a bit confused when the author threw this bit in at the end because it seems silly to think Lego is a contributor to that in any material way. reply metadat 19 hours agorootparentprev> That would just be greenwashing.Greenwashing, also called \"green sheen\", is a form of advertising or marketing spin in which green PR and green marketing are deceptively used to persuade the public that an organization&#x27;s products, aims and policies are environmentally friendly.Green-manufactured LEGO doesn&#x27;t qualify..Edit: @beloch: got it, thanks for educating me. reply beloch 19 hours agorootparentIt fits the definition if the new manufacturing process is less environmentally friendly. reply blamazon 19 hours agorootparentJust to state one aspect of this, since I don&#x27;t think you said it explicitly. Alternative plastics currently are generally not as efficient to produce as mainline plastics, IE they consume more energy. If that energy consumption is connected to fossil fuels, it could be a step backwards to implement such a process at Lego scale. There&#x27;s also another aspect of, if the demand of global oil used for plastics goes down, it could be more appealing to burn oil for energy, if the price goes down accordingly. There&#x27;s some argument to be made that while we spin down the oil industry we should be making more fossil fuel based plastics, to be entombed in the earth somewhat like nuclear waste. I say all this unhappily as someone who really wants our species to make forward progress on climate and resource policy. reply yyyk 14 hours agorootparentNote that in a lot of cases, getting rid of plastics really means &#x27;burning plastics&#x27; which is definitely not warming-friendly.* This is done since a landfill has its own issues, and recycling plastics does not work. replyalentred 15 hours agoprevHard to not to have a cognitive dissonance on this one. As a kid I loved Lego, and my kids have plenty too. But thinking of all that plastic that eventually makes its way to a dumpster... Lego is brining so much joy, but you can&#x27;t ignore the environmental impact too. I am actually disappointed at myself about not having thought to buy second-hand instead.It is an interesting example of why the pollution problem is hard. Here we are not even talking about anything essential for the quality life, not even comfort. That&#x27;s basically \"just a toy\".

Toy cars break or the models get out of fashion. Electronic stuff is broken or severely out of date 20 years later. Sport equipment can be durable, but usually holds for less than 10 years.In the grand scheme of things, Lego is completely fine, we have hundreds of more wasteful one-time-plastic usages. reply nuancebydefault 13 hours agoparentprevFor me, lego is an example of the mantra to make durable things that last for a very long time (several generations), having the benefit of not easily ending in a landfill or being burnt. reply dudul 12 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve never heard of someone throwing away legislation.

Cellulose acetate warps or breaks down in two main ways: it can warp from plasticizer migration, and it can “weep” or liquify as it ages. Weeping has been called “vinegar syndrome” because of the smell involved, which of course is acetic acid. reply kjkjadksj 15 hours agorootparentBest to store the ray bans in a jar of vinegar then? reply hammock 14 hours agorootparentStoring in vinegar would catalyze and accelerate the decomposition of the acetate. And once it starts, it can’t be stopped.To prevent decomposition, use breathable enclosures and store in a low temperature and low relative humidity. Proper storage and handling practices, particularly using gloves and storing in low light environments, can prevent vinegar syndrome almost entirely.These are learnings gleaned from those involved in the historical preservation of acetate photographic films. reply deviantbit 20 hours agoprevWhere is the stainless steel?

It&#x27;s mostly made of large blocks with a series of notches in them. Metal bars are placed in the notches so the blocks can move slightly in relation to each other, but not so much as to fall apart. reply cuttysnark 18 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a recycling plant not far from where I take the train. In their yard, they have large (5&#x27; x 3&#x27;) concrete blocks that are \"stackable\" in that they have voids in their bottoms that fit their counterpart&#x27;s ridges on the tops—just like a lego.They stack these 4 or 5 high and create huge U-shaped corrals for various types of metals.My town does something similar to store rock stalk for the winter—these blocks are stacked and a pre-fab roof is placed directly on top.To my knowledge, there is no mortar or rebar of any kind, and it can be undone and reworked into another configuration with just a forklift.These are meant to be temporary, but have been there for >8 and >5 years respectively.Somewhat related: The famed \"Jersey Divider\" is cast in a similar way, albeit without any consideration for vertical stacking. reply azdle 18 hours agorootparent> concrete blocks that are \"stackable\"I&#x27;ve heard these called &#x27;Benton Blocks&#x27;, though, looking that up now, that seems to be a brand [0], not sure if there&#x27;s a more specific generic term other than &#x27;concrete block&#x27;.> Somewhat related: The famed \"Jersey Divider\" is cast in a similar way, albeit without any consideration for vertical stacking.I think Jersey Barriers are usually re-enforced with steel rebar and all the ones that I&#x27;ve seen have a steel cable running through them with a loop at either end to link up to the one next to it, by dropping a pole or similar through both sets of loops, to create a continuous wall.

Can I safely put a sandwich in my self-made LEGO lunchbox and then eat it? reply GuB-42 20 hours agoparentABS can be food safe, but there is more to food safety than the type of plastic used. And I don&#x27;t think Lego is food safe, it is certainly not advertised as such.An important consideration when it comes to food safety is that your it doesn&#x27;t become a breeding ground for bacteria. That&#x27;s why FDM 3D prints are usually not food safe no matter what they are made off. For your Lego lunchbox, assuming the bricks themselves were food safe, you would probably need to regularly take the box apart and wash each brick individually.That being said it probably won&#x27;t kill you, but don&#x27;t expect Lego or anyone in a position of authority to tell you that&#x27;s fine. reply amelius 20 hours agorootparentOk, so now my next question: is LEGO dishwasher safe? reply kuschku 17 hours agorootparentYes, but the best way to wash Lego bricks is to disassemble the build, put the bricks into a washing net (the type you&#x27;d use for a bra), and put it in a european-style washing machine together with your regular clothes.It&#x27;ll come out perfectly clean without any damage. reply OJFord 20 hours agorootparentprevDepends on the plastic, it&#x27;s just the same question (for plastics anyway) as what temperature does it deform at. So if a thermoplastic just needs to be stable up to at least 70°C or whatever max temp. you&#x27;re going to run it at. reply xattt 18 hours agorootparentI’d be concerned for the water tightness of this theoretical modular dishwasher. reply OJFord 20 hours agoparentprevApprox. a billion times more risk from wherever you&#x27;ve been keeping the bricks, what else they&#x27;ve touched etc. rather than the plastic itself.I assume you&#x27;re from the US?

It&#x27;s really noticeable in 3D printing and food preservation communities&#x2F;recipes. reply RedShift1 20 hours agoparentprevWhy wouldn&#x27;t you?

Is it the age rather than the material that puts you off?I assume not porousness, since by far the largest pores regardless of material will be the brick joints. reply kuschku 19 hours agorootparentBPA-containing materials are not food-grade in EU. reply bseidensticker 14 hours agorootparentPP does not contain BPA.

It doesn&#x27;t refer to any specific type of chemical used to create plastic.If the question is whether or not lego bricks generate microplastics, the answer is no, not really. Microplastics are mostly a problem when they wind up in the water supply, either from plastic fibers in clothes that are being washed, or plastic microbeads in shampoo that gets rinsed down the drain, or in plastic trash that has wound up in a river or ocean and is deteriorating into smaller particles. reply usrusr 19 hours agorootparent4 mm is already considered microplastics?

Besides, it is one of the most reusable toys to ever exist. reply dudul 12 hours agoparentprevIf it&#x27;s plastic in use does it matter? Legos don&#x27;t get thrown out. They almost never break with the exception of a few exotic pieces that are a big more fragile. Even clips are surprisingly durable.Compare this with dolls, trucks, etc that break after 6 months and do end up in the trash.

Many strange and wonderful things happened at these events that wouldn’t make a lick of sense today. Here is a collection of unrelated memories which may be altered to protect the guilty. A man who runs a LAN facility will generally not give you a Windows 98 SE CD key, even if you need to reinstall Windows on your PC during an event. A LAN isn’t legitimate unless at least one person has to reinstall Windows along the way. Multi-round tournaments seem like a good idea but you will never get anybody into their allocated matches at the times they’re supposed to be there. If you mod your ATX case so that the power button is gigantic and illuminated with a red LED, someone will come along while you’re gaming and wonder out loud “what does this button do?” while pressing it. Having a PC with a window in the side of the case does in fact give you credibility. If you take a 500 GB drive to a public LAN where the average drive size is 80 GB then it is possible that it will be stolen from your box while you’re taking a break go-karting. If you use a crack that generates malicious traffic from your IP then you may be forced to reinstall Windows before you can reconnect to the network. If you don’t have enough warez to reach the minimum share limit for the DC++ server you can always add the directories for your games installed under Program Files. The desk you’re seated at may have a badge at the back telling you which static IP to use, but you can ignore that if the venue has upgraded to DHCP. If you’re using a 10 Mbit hub and copy the same directory to two Windows SMB hosts simultaneously it is somehow smart enough to make the transfers coincide so it can transmit the same data to both at once. To this day I have no idea what heuristic it used but honest to god, it slowed down the earlier transfer and then went in lockstep file by file for the remainder. If you throw an old motherboard onto the 11 kV power lines on a nearby pole it will toast some components but probably not cause a power outage. Windows 98 SE requires that you reboot after changing your IP address settings. Windows 2000 is quite good for gaming and has the added benefit that you will be prompted to press Ctrl-Alt-Del to logon, which feels corporate (or school-like) and cool. If a pirated game comes with a crack.exe then you run the crack.exe. What could go wrong? There were websites which aggregated downloads of keygens for various games. These worked more often than you would expect. In an attempt to reduce piracy for multiplayer, game producers such as Blizzard let you install “spawn” copies of the software which could only participate in a multiplayer game and didn’t require the CD to be in the drive. Alcohol 120% was the free tool of choice to emulate a CD drive for ISOs of games which required the CD to be inserted for copy protection, or rip a CD for that purpose. This only became popular once hard drives became big enough for people to spend many gigabytes imaging their CDs. The cool kids had a Barton Athlon XP 2500+ and a Radeon 9600. The rich kids had a 9800. Internet access wasn’t a thing until the later years. LANs which tried to provide internet had strict quotas or bandwidth limits and generally found it difficult to manage. If you had the right ICQ number you could repeat it multiple times to generate a valid Starcraft CD key. Sometimes LANs would get terrible sponsorship deals and nerds would fight over bounty like a CD of Visual C++ 6 Enterprise Edition. A man who runs a LAN facility might sell you an RTL8139 PCI card for $15 if you want to upgrade to 100 Mbps. This card might work great for a decade+ after. If you’re a poor high school student who wants to upgrade your home network from a hub to a switch, you could pay the lion’s share of the $55 for the right to keep it at your house between LANs. WINE can basically only run Starcraft. If someone has shared their installation of Warcraft III over SMB it will run much faster if you copy it to your local machine first rather than execute it directly from the network folder. Motherboards had headers to connect USB ports built into the case but they were completely unstandardised so you had to slot them in pin-by-pin in the correct locations following your motherboard manual. If you got this wrong you could short out your PSU through thin wires by plugging in a USB mouse, which would create an awful whirring sound. A commercial LAN venue would advertise itself on a local pop music radio station by having a dialogue of people arguing about which IP addresses to use. If you had the oldest PC in your group, you might be connecting to the hub via coax and a BNC connector while everyone else is using CAT5. What’s WiFi?",

I was responsible for the Flash community at Macromedia, and we would set up 4 xboxes with split screen for 8 player Halo 2 and 3 tournaments in conference rooms (which has multiple plasma screens already set up).I quickly realized that we could use this to make friends in the broader community, so we bought a bunch of LCD monitors and pelican cases, and began to take our setup on the road to Flash conferences. During the day we would hang out at the conference, learn new programing &#x2F; visual techniques and generally see super cool Flash stuff, and at night we would invite everyone over to our hotel room and then play Halo all night. We made so many friends and close contacts in the community through this, and it really help us meet a lot of people, and build strong, personal relationships.I remember we were on a 6 week bus tour in North America doing events for Adobe AIR, and making a detour to NYC for the Halo 3 launch at at Best Buy. We then played on the bus all night long.Here is a clip of me walking to the launch, so happy and singing about it being my Halo birthday (whatever that means!).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=QVQKgui28O8So many good times. reply prox 2 hours agoparentI miss Macromedia, Adobe is just a corporate grey blob.

You ever played Quake with a bunch of dudes on speed? It&#x27;s fucking nuts.The smells. Some LANs would go on for a week. Lots spanned several days, most lasted upwards of 12 hours.People didn&#x27;t game with laptops. You had to bring you whole case, your monitors, accessories. It was great when LCDs came about.

It had a huge crack right down the center, but was still just about usable. I asked him how that happened. He said he was playing online (Counterstrike I think?) and lost a match, causing him to punch the screen in frustration.That screen must have cost >$1000 at the time.Sure enough, the guy was a tool - the kind of gamer that gloats over every win and questions the opponent’s sexuality after every loss. And he was every bit as toxic right there in the room with us.The experience completely put me off online versus-stranger gaming forever, and in retrospect I’m very grateful to him for this. reply k__ 2 hours agoparentHaha, I had a 17\" TFT in 2000.Was at a 600 people LAN and only one other dude had one. reply stavros 1 hour agorootparentDid it have a huge crack down the center? reply k__ 54 minutes agorootparentHaha, no.It didn&#x27;t have any issues ever.In fact, I found another one (same model) 10 years later on the streets and used the two for a ther 2 years, until I bought two 27\" displays when I finally got a real job.Those things were build for eternity. reply HellDunkel 2 hours agoparentprevKudos!

It reminds me of a LAN party we had at a friend&#x27;s house. We had a bag of spare parts but, of course, the guy bringing the bag was late. This was around 1992 or so, thus before mobile phones and nobody knew anything. Our host (the pr0n guy, but instead of watching porn he liked to put short porn mpgs into Windows autostart of unattended PCs) in desperation soldered a make-shift terminator from parts of his dad&#x27;s model railroad. I know he used a t-junction, but I don&#x27;t know how he did it. Took him half an hour and it worked good enough to set up the network (Personal Netware at the time) before the guy with the bag of parts showed up. Quite a feat, and good thing we weren&#x27;t so much into drinking at this point of time.

I do a small lan weekend with friends, around 15 ppl, about once a year.But we struggle finding suitable games that are LAN based, and end up playing CS:GO. Would love some more LAN games, any tips? reply eerikkivistik 27 minutes agorootparentSure thing. So a few notes, you can host CS:GO and Dota 2 games on lan. You do have to be logged in to steam and have a network connection, but the games themselves can be played on lan, so the outbound connection doesn&#x27;t have to be fast. As for some other games, I highly recommend a cracked version of the original WC3:FT, Starcraft, Battlefield 1942 and Vietnam. Some more insane people, start up a 3-day game of Civilization or Heroes of Might and Magic 3. If you have enough people, I also recommend Enemy Territory (2003 version) with some mods, its awesome. But you need at least 20 people for this. Just for laughs, if we end up with a tie, our tiebreaker is Liero behind a single keyboard.Edit: Oh, forgot about Age of Empires 2, Rise of Nations. But if you want a good Lan-only experience you kind of have to use cracked versions of old games. I make up for this morally by buying a newer version if there is one even available, then use a cracked old version for playing. reply asadm 2 hours agoparentprevThat sounds amazing! reply eerikkivistik 1 hour agorootparentIt sure is. reply thefz 10 minutes agoprev> Alcohol 120% was the free tool of choice to emulate a CD drive for ISOs of games which required the CD to be insertedWasn&#x27;t that Virtual Clone drive?

I&#x27;d replace the BNC terminators and it was good to go again.Next, a lot of \"C&C: Red Alert\" over direct modem connection (2 player).Finally, I got ethernet on my PC.

A brushless gimbal motor is paired with a magnetic encoder to provide closed-loop torque feedback control, making it possible to dynamically create and adjust the feel of detents and endstops. Join the Discord community to discuss the project with others, show off your build, or help answer each others' questions! Designs SmartKnob View The \"SmartKnob View\" is the premium SmartKnob experience with an integrated display shown in my demo video. Under active development. 🎉 Motors are now available! If you've been following this project, you'll know that the recommended motors went out of stock nearly immediately after it was published. Thanks to the community, we were able to identify the likely original manufacturer, and recently SparkFun Electronics has been getting them produced and regularly stocking them! (However, they've been selling out quickly each time they restock, so definitely sign up for backorder notifications if they're out of stock when you check). Thanks to everyone who helped search and investigate different motor options along the way! Features: 240x240 round LCD (\"GC9A01\"), protected by 39.5mm watch glass on rotor BLDC gimbal motor, with a hollow shaft for mechanically & electrically connecting the LCD Powered by ESP32-PICO-V3-02 (Lilygo TMicro32 Plus module) PCB flexure and strain gauges used for press detection (haptic feedback provided via the motor) 8 side-firing RGB LEDs (SK6812-SIDE-A) illuminate ring around the knob USB-C (2.0) connector for 5V power and serial data/programming (CH340) VEML7700 ambient light sensor for automatic backlight & LED intensity adjustment Versatile back plate for mounting - use either 4x screws, or 2x 3M medium Command strips (with cutouts for accessing removal tabs after installation) Front cover snaps on for easy access to the PCB Current status: Not recommended for general use (mechanical and electrical revisions may be needed depending on motor/electronics availability) Demo video How it works 3D CAD Latest Fusion 360 Model: https://a360.co/3BzkU0n Build your own? While this is a \"DIY\" open-source project, it is not yet a mature plug-and-play project. If you intend to build your own, note that it requires advanced soldering experience to build - very small-pitch surface-mount soldering is required (reflow or hot air recommended), and assembly is quite time-consuming and delicate. Please go into it with the expectation that you will almost certainly need to be able to troubleshoot some hardware and firmware issues yourself - I recommend reviewing/understanding the schematics and basic firmware before jumping in! More documentation on the BOM and what parts you need to order is coming in the future - thanks so much for your interest! Follow me on Twitter for the latest updates on this and other projects. View the latest auto-generated (untested) Base PCB Interactive BOM and Screen PCB Interactive BOM (or, the combined BOM csv) for electronics/hardware parts list. ⚠ These are auto-generated from the latest untested revision on GitHub. For tested/stable/recommended artifacts, use a release instead. A few miscellaneous notes in the meantime: There's limited space inside the LCD mount for wiring, and 8 wires need to fit through the hole in the center. I used 30 AWG wire-wrapping wire. Enamel-coated wire would probably work too. Older versions of the design (as seen in the videos) used glued-on BF350-3AA strain gauges to detect presses; in v0.5 these were replaced with footprints for SMD resistors, which exhibit similar properties when stretched/compressed and are much easier to assemble. The TMC6300 is tiny and has a bottom pad, so I would seriously consider getting a stencil along with the PCB order. Even with the stencil I needed to manually clean up some bridging afterward; I highly recommend Chip Quik NC191 gel flux, available on Amazon (or use this non-affiliate link instead) or from your electronics distributor of choice. Flux is also very helpful when soldering the LCD ribbon cable to to screen PCB. For breadboard prototyping, the TMC6300-BOB or SparkFun's TMC6300 driver board are awesome and way easier to work with than the bare chip if you just want to play around with low current BLDC motors For AliExpress purchases: I highly recommend only using AliExpress Standard Shipping (purchasing in the US). I have had multiple purchases take months or never get delivered when purchased with Cainiao or other low cost shipping options, whereas AliExpress Standard is very reliable and generally faster in my experience. Make sure to check the open issues - this design is not yet \"stable\", so beware that everything may not go smoothly. I would not recommend ordering these parts yourself until the stable release v1.0 milestone is complete, as there are some mechanical interference issues in the current revision. Future plans: consider switch to using an ESP32-S3-MINI-1 module get wifi configured and working (probably MQTT?). Currently memory is an issue with the full display framebuffer sprite. PSRAM might fix this (requires newer ESP-IDF & unreleased Arduino core, and from a brief test I got horrible performance with PSRAM enabled), or the next item might help reduce memory: migrate to LVGL, for better display rendering and easy support for menus, etc. Shouldn't require a full 240x240x24b framebuffer in memory, freeing some for wifi, etc. Home Assistant integration, or other real-world applications ??? Profit 😉 Base PCB Ordering notes: use white soldermask, for reflecting light from RGB LED ring around the knob. Should be 1.2mm thick (not \"standard\" 1.6mm). If you are ordering a stencil for solder paste from JLCPCB and plan to apply paste by hand (as shown in the video) without a stencil frame/machine, make sure to select \"Customized size\" and enter smaller dimensions (e.g. 100mm x 100mm) to avoid getting a much larger stencil than you need. This will also likely reduce the cost of shipping substantially! Also, select only the Top side; the bottom only has 2 SMT components - the motor connector and VEML7700 ALS - so it's not worth getting a stencil for that. Latest auto-generated (untested and likely broken!) artifacts⚠: Schematic Interactive BOM PCB Packet Gerbers ⚠ For tested/stable/recommended artifacts, use a release instead. Screen PCB Ordering notes: Must be 1.2mm thick (not \"standard\" 1.6mm) per mechanical design. (The PCB silkscreen mentions 0.6mm thickness - this is the thickness of the VHB tape for adhering the LCD; the PCB should be 1.2mm thick) There are few enough components on the Screen PCB that I chose to hand-solder them rather than reflow with solder paste and a stencil, but if you order a stencil, see the note above about selecting a \"Customized size\" to be easier to handle and save on shipping. Also make sure to select the Bottom side only; all the components are on the bottom side of the screen PCB. Latest auto-generated (untested and likely broken!) artifacts⚠: Schematic Interactive BOM PCB Packet Gerbers ⚠ For tested/stable/recommended artifacts, use a release instead. Printed parts You will need six printed parts. The current stable designs can be found as STL assets in the v185 mechanical release or you can export the latest untested designs from the CAD model by opening it in Fusion 360: https://a360.co/3BzkU0n The parts can probably be FDM 3D printed with a well-tuned printer, but the parts shown in videos/photos were MJF printed in nylon for tight tolerances and better surface finish. If you wanted a simpler build, you could omit the LCD and just merge the knob + glass from the model into a single STL to get a closed-top knob. Export and print the following 6 parts: Enclosure Knob (RotorAssembly->KnobAssembly->Knob) ScreenPlatform RotorSpacer (RotorAssembly->RotorSpacer) MountBase BackPlate ⚠ If you opt to go for MJF Nylon printing from JLCPCB, their system may complain about < 0.8mm wall thickness detected on the MountBase, ScreenPlatform and RotorSpacer parts. This appears to be a false positive, possibly on some of the print tapers. You should be able to ignore this, as all print orders at JLCPCB are subject to a final manual review, and they will contact you by email if there are any job-stopping issues or risks with your prints. NanoFOC (3rd party) If you're looking to tinker with FOC/haptic feedback, but don't want to build a full SmartKnob View yourself, I can recommend the NanoFOC DevKit++, an open-source design made and sold by a member of the SmartKnob community! It's super compact and is a great testbed or core for building your own BLDC-based haptic input device. The NanoFOC uses an ESP32-S3, and the SmartKnob firmware works on it out of the box; just select the nanofoc environment in PlatformIO rather than the view environment when uploading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How much does it cost? I wish I could tell you now, but I don't actually know off the top of my head. Check back soon - I've only built a few so far, which was the result of a bunch of tinkering and prototyping over an extended period, so I don't have all the expenses tallied up yet. Probably less than $200 in parts? But some items have gotten more expensive, and you may be limited by minimum order quantities or shipping charges from multiple separate suppliers. Does it work with XYZ? Not yet, regardless of whatever \"XYZ\" you're thinking of. So far I've only implemented enough firmware for the demo shown in the video, so you can't actually use it for anything productive yet. The basic detent configuration API is there, but not much else. Lots of firmware work remains to be done. If you build one, I'd love your help adding support for \"XYZ\" though! Can I buy one as a kit or already assembled? Probably not? Or at least, I don't have any immediate plans to sell them myself. It's not that I don't want you to be happy, but hardware is a hard business and I just work on this stuff in my free time. It's open source with a fairly permissive license though, so in theory anyone could start offering kits/assemblies. If someone does go down that route of selling them, note that attribution is required (and I wouldn't say no to royalties/tips/thanks if you're in a giving mood 🙂). Firmware and Software More extensive documentation of the firmware and software (and how to get started) can be found in the dedicated SmartKnob Firmware and Software Guide General Component Info Magnetic encoders MT6701 (MagnTek) Excellent sensor at a reasonable price - highly recommended. Less noisy than TLV493D, and more responsive (control loop is more stable) using SSI. Lots of IO options - SSI, I2C, and ABZ - should offer good response latency SSI includes CRC to validate data No power-down or low-power options - may not be ideal for battery-powered devices Not available from US distributors (Mouser, Digi-Key) Datasheet Ordering (LCSC) TLV493D (Infineon) Not used in the SmartKnob view, but a common/popular magnetic encoder in general. It's a mediocre choice for a haptic feedback implementation. Easy to prototype with using Adafruit's QWIIC breakout board. In my testing, it's noisy, requiring filtering/smoothing that can slow responsiveness, hurting control loop stability. Or, with less filtering, the noise can easily be \"amplified\" by the derivative component in the PID motor torque controller, causing audible (and tactile) humming/buzzing. But the bigger issue is that there is apparently a known silicon issue that causes the internal ADC to sometimes completely lock up, requiring a full reset and re-configuration, which can cause delays/gaps in data! See section 5.6 in the User Manual In the Master Controlled Mode (MCM) or the Fast Mode (FM) the ADC conversion may hang up. A hang up can be detected by: - Frame Counter (FRM) counter stucks and does not increment anymore. In my experience testing 4 different Adafruit breakout boards, 2 of them (50%) regularly exhibit this lockup behavior within a minute or two of use. It is possible to detect and auto-reset (and there is code in the project to do so), but it is slow and may cause undesirable jumps/delays if the sensor locks up often. Datasheet AS5600 (AMS) A mediocre choice. Cheap breakout boards are readily available. In my testing, it's fairly noisy (anecdotally, noisier than the TLV493d), requiring filtering/smoothing that can slow responsiveness, hurting control loop stability. Additionally, it saturates at a lower magnetic field strength than other sensors I tested, requiring a significant air gap (8-10mm) when used with a strong neodymium diametric magnet like Radial Magnets 8995. Datasheet Motor drivers TMC6300-LA This is a relatively new IC and it's a perfect match! There generally aren't any other drivers (with integrated fets) that meet the requirements for the low-voltage and low-current motors used in this project (DRV8316 might work, but has not been tested). Highlights: 2-11V DC motor supply input Up to 1.2A RMS Tiny (3x3mm QFN) Datasheet Product page Motors 32mm Rotor, Hollow Shaft, Diametric magnet 32mm rotor 15mm overall height (including magnet), 12.75mm height w/o magnet, 9mm rotor height low/zero cogging - excellent for completely smooth input 5.9mm hollow shaft built-in diametric magnet for encoder Proven option This is overall the easiest motor to get started with. Low cogging and a built-in diametric magnet are great! Available from SparkFun!

It does show though how much more difficult these are than software projects. 3d design and printing, hardware sourcing issues, the need for careful component selection, very poor support for automation of the toolchain, etc etc. As a minor hardware tinkerer this is both impressive and daunting. Bravo! reply bryancoxwell 10 hours agoparentNot to mention the cost of failure and iteration. reply fest 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s all relative. It has gotten at least an order of magnitude less expensive over the last 10-15 years- 3D printing, low cost PCB manufacturers, availability and cost of automated machine tools like CO2 laser-cutters.It has actually gotten to a point where often time is the most \"expensive\" component of hobby&#x2F;open-source hardware projects- while the cost of CAD software has decreased (mostly due to competition and increased demand that allows to spread the development cost over larger customer base), the productivity of CAD-related tasks has not increased much, if at all. reply Loic 1 hour agorootparentAfter many years of being a father of 3 active kids, you can remove the \"often\" in your sentence :-D reply Jabrov 7 hours agoparentprevtest reply seabass-labrax 11 hours agoprevI absolutely love that this is open source hardware; there have been multiple circuits available on the web for this kind of peripheral, but nothing even approaching the level of polish that this has.If the designer happens to be here, I have a question regarding the circuit. Is there any protection against voltage produced by a user&#x27;s rotation of the knob? The TMC6300 IC that the schematic shows is directly connected to the BDCM without any intermediate circuitry, but the only &#x27;protections&#x27; listed in its datasheet are related to failures related to the motor being used as a motor, not as a generator. reply scottbez1 11 hours agoparentDesigner here - I will admit that I just do this as a bit of a hobby and I&#x27;m not an EE, so I don&#x27;t have a great answer for you, but generally speaking since this is a high resistance&#x2F;low KV motor and there&#x27;s only so fast you could spin it by hand realistically, I think the voltages you could generate that way shouldn&#x27;t be so high as to cause damage in most cases. The TMC6300 datasheet does show it directly connected to the BLDC motor so that&#x27;s what I based this design on.There are probably some best practices that I&#x27;m missing though (diode on the main supply maybe?), so if anyone knowledgeable wants to chime in, I&#x27;m all ears! (Or I suppose pull requests are welcome too). reply seabass-labrax 10 hours agorootparentThanks for the swift response! I&#x27;ve been interested in haptic feedback for a long time, but so far have not come across any general way to calculate the acceptable power dissipation for a given motor and driver circuit. Physical controls have so much to offer in ease-of-use, but the chief downside of them currently is that there is no easy &#x27;two-way binding&#x27;. reply K0balt 42 minutes agorootparentMotors often run at high rpm and then shut off, coasting to a stop.

Morocco earthquake latest: At least 2,012 people have been killed and 2,059 injured in a 6.8-magnitude earthquake that hit the North African country of Morocco late Friday. King Mohammed VI of Morocco has mobilized the army's search and rescue teams to find and rescue any survivors, using helicopters and drones. The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter was in the Moroccan High Atlas mountain range, about 46 miles southeast of Marrakech. The U.S. Embassy in Rabat, Morocco's capital, extended its condolences to the victims and their families, said it was not aware of any U.S. nationals killed though some may have been injured.

Carl Court / Getty Images SHARE THIS - Copied 7h ago / 8:04 PM PDT American in Morocco recalls apartment shaking, community response Dennis Romero Author TaNesha Barnes said last night’s earthquake was like nothing else she had ever felt. The walls of the American’s Marrakech area apartment complex came alive and shook throughout what she described as an achingly long-term temblor. Afterward neighbors, all physically unharmed, gathered outside, and pretty much stayed there amid frightening aftershocks. The Moroccan people and others with roots in the region couldn’t do much about the destructive wave that pulsed across the geography of North Africa. But Barnes said the community she now calls home has been a rock for those who need help recovering from the temblor. “People are stocking up to help other people,” she said in a Zoom interview today. “There’s a sense of love, prayer and sharing,” said Barnes, the CEO of Mwasi Creative Community, which aims to help Black Americans heal from traumatic and often racist and discriminatory experiences through retreats in Morocco. The city of Marrakech was alighted by entire neighborhoods moving outdoors in the wake of Friday’s quake. The response has only strengthened her resolve that it is the place for her healing community “We stayed outside,” Barnes said. \"All of our Moroccan friends called as if we were family to make sure we were OK.” SHARE THIS - Copied 8h ago / 7:33 PM PDT Hundreds sleep on sidewalks in Marrakech Bill O'Reilly MARRAKECH, Morocco — While the airport in Casablanca felt like business as usual, crowded but calm with tourists and traveling families, the impact of the earthquake became apparent as soon as we reached the outskirts of Marrakech. At Rond Point de la Palmeraie, the main traffic circle at the entrance to the city, hundreds of people were seen sleeping on the sidewalks and grass along the road. The rows of people sleeping then stretched along the length of the boulevard driving into the city.

Maybe it was loud, but that&#x27;s not what I remember, so I can understand why the descriptions vary so broadly.No good footage of the Northridge event is really very available, but there is plenty of detailed (and unfortunately graphic) footage of the 2015 Nepal event, the &#x27;sounds of chaos&#x27; far and wide out-match the sound of the low rumbling quake -- but that could be a deception of the microphones; I would imagine most of them lack the range to properly capture the low roar of an earthquake. reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentNorthridge was also really early in the morning (4:30 am), so it&#x27;s possible you were sleeping during the actual earthquake. reply mvdtnz 10 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re not silent but they&#x27;re also not \"deafeningly loud\".

The early signs are there but we need to look into them very carefully and not taking anything for granted. The largest and most lethal Tokyo earthquake happened exactly 100 years ago reportedly killing more than 10K residents, namely the Great Kantō earthquake back in 1923 [1]. Imagine if similar disaster now with the huge number of current Tokyo population. That&#x27;s probably the reason the Tokyo residents are paranoid now, and righly so.At the moment we have good results for predicting earthquakes (not forecasting) that should be able to warn the residents a few days before the impending major earthquake. The results are consistent based on offline data of the recent Turkeys, New Zealand, Indonesia and Philippines earthquakes. Hopefully we can reliably repeat the early detection capability with the real-time data, if fundings are available.

Gauls resisted Roman invasion, and even managed some degree of cohesion under Vercingetorix because they felt the threat of the common enemy. reply kriops 11 hours agorootparentprevYou should read the Declaration of Independence :)It is a right to live and settle wherever you please. In practice YMMV depending on different states’ ability to recognize rights, however.And yes, the Declaration of Independence isn’t authoritative on the topic of rights, but it is a very clear cut explanation of how rights (ought to) work, without diving into the philosophy of it. reply asdswe 18 hours agorootparentprevIf you remove borders, you also have to remove social safety nets and other things which make rich countries better to live in than poor ones. reply delecti 14 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s no inherent truth of the universe that requires countries to have such disparate wealth that some are so much better to live in.

Convincing people that traditional methods aren’t earthquake resistant is one way to sidestep the issue.It’s not particularly expensive to build somewhat earthquake resistant structures. Quite a lot of it comes down to building techniques rather than significant effort or expensive materials.Multi story stone building generally do extremely poorly, but there’s a few cheap methods to significantly improve things such as timber bracing. The goal isn’t to make the building survive unscathed but to minimize casualties. reply hutzlibu 18 hours agorootparent\"Convincing people that traditional methods aren’t earthquake resistant is one way to sidestep the issue.\"Actually, the really old traditional buildings in morroco are quite earthquake resistant, because they are still standing and it was not the first earthquake there.It&#x27;s the cheaply build new houses, that are the problem and yes, now is the time to give awareness that you should not build too cheaply and what one can do even with limited ressources.

    "originBody": "Google, Meta, Amazon hiring low-paid H1B workers after US layoffs: report Even as global tech giants are carrying out mass layoffs, several top Silicon Valley companies are reportedly looking to hire lower-paid tech workers from foreign countries. Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Zoom, Salesforce and Palantir have applied for thousands of H1B worker visas this year, according to a US Department of Labor data, reported independent investigative journalist Lee Fang. Ironically, thousands of workers on H1B visa, including Indians, have been affected by the layoffs in the United States, with many taking to social media to share the news and seek new opportunities. Just a month after Sundar Pichai announced Google’s plan to cut 12,000 jobs around the world in January, the company filed applications for H1B visas to hire software engineers, analytical consultants, user experience researchers and other roles from outside the United States, with several requests aimed for new Google employees to join in August, the report states. Google parent Alphabet owned Waymo too has reportedly filed similar H1B applications to hire engineers. Meta has laid off nearly 25 per cent of its estimated workforce in just a few months in what CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the company's \"year of efficiency\" as the US tech sector continues to downsize. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in March laid out a plan to cut 9,000 more jobs from the online retail giant's workforce, following the 18,000 that were axed in January. The layoffs account for a smaller percentage of Amazon's total workforce, which ran up to 1.5 million people in December 2022, than the cuts seen at some other tech giants. Jassy told workers that the extra layoffs were necessary as the company seeks to downsize after years of hiring, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic when people turned to the internet for shopping. In January, Microsoft said it would eliminate 10,000 jobs, almost 5 per cent of the global workforce, as it braces for a potential recession. In an email to employees, CEO Satya Nadella said, “While we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas.” USER CONSENT We at moneycontrol use cookies and other tracking technologies to assist you with navigation and determine your location.

The problem with hiring too many H1Bs is they speak to each other in Chinese and thus take forever to become proficient at communicating with the rest of the company.Also, I&#x27;d call into question the credibility of this article.

For them this was a great way to learn more Dutch. Right now there is also a parent at my kids school who is Welsh, and even though he understands Dutch very well and prefers to speak it, everytime I approach him for a conversation the first sentence in my head is formed in English.

Chinese H1b candidates are post graduates from PhD programs and are less common but make up the 2nd largest but still extremely small group. reply ofjcihen 17 hours agorootparentprevI agree with this but I’ve found that the people making the decisions of who to hire usually have some incentive to hire from a certain country.Those reasons could be kickbacks, family stake in the company, etc.Edit: This is completely anecdotal.

For example, they are generally of the mindset that Americans are stupider and lazier than them which is why they are here. So they will vent their frustrations on Americans by calling us stupid and lazy and entitled because we have citizenship but they do all the work. It&#x27;s not a healthy way to view this country or their coworkers.

Unlike the true modern slavery of which is migrant workers (like described here https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.antislavery.org&#x2F;world-cup-2022-the-reality-for-m...), where their passports are confiscated, etc.H1B is exploiting the rules for cheap labour. It does benefit the H1B holder - since they would otherwise not have signed up. The losers in the situation are the local workers who expect to be paid higher, but is out-competed by these foreign workers. reply afavour 21 hours agorootparent“Modern slavery” is definitely an exaggeration but many are also not quite so free to quit.The H1B is a “dual intent” visa, meaning you can apply for permanent residency while you have it. But you must maintain your H1B the entire time, which can be a decade or more for folks from places like India. You can transfer an H1B but it’s not easy and if you quit your job you must line another one up in 60 days or say goodbye to the life you’ve built yourself in the US. Some employers are happy to take advantage of this. reply ajmurmann 21 hours agorootparentThis is what creates more downward pressure on everyone&#x27;s comp than just getting foreign workers. It artificially creates a group of workers for whom it&#x27;s significantly harder and more risky to change jobs or simply quit when they are unsatisfied. I think everyone in tech would be better off if you wouldn&#x27;t lose the H1B quickly if unemployed and if you wouldn&#x27;t need to rely on an employer doing extra work to sponsor you. Make it two years instead of two months and make it so that the visa holder just can mail in proof of a paycheck. There is no real downside to this change for anybody in US society. reply dccoolgai 20 hours agorootparentOr like... if the actual _company_ that claims it \"needs that worker from outside the U.S. so so so much\" actually took the risk on instead of foisting it on the poor employee (and by extension, the entire labor market). My 2-step process for fixing the H1-B system.1. H1Bs are _auctioned_ instead of raffled. You really need that H1B? Prove it - pay for it. 2. Sponsoring companies are responsible for cost of living for that employee for the entire duration of their H1B. That obligation can be transferred to another company.3. (Bonus) After reaching a certain threshold of \"taxes paid to the U.S.\" (maybe 300k or something) H1B holders _automatically_ get their green cards. No questions asked. If you can take that much of their money, they can be citizens. reply swalberg 18 hours agorootparentMy issue with \"H1B to the highest bidder\" is that there&#x27;s a lot of industries outside of tech that use H1Bs like healthcare, academia, skilled trades, or heck, even fashion models. I think something like that would have to be paired with quotas on the industry otherwise high tech salaries would blow away possibly-even-more-important healthcare and research spots.As for #2, the main issue now is more of supply and demand. The US only gives out 140,000 employment based green cards a year (plus some from other unused categories), which also includes the worker&#x27;s families. There are far more ways to get an employment based green card than through H1B. The problems we&#x27;re hearing about are less to do with the process (which _is_ byzantine) and more to do with that there are not enough green cards to go around.And just as an aside, there&#x27;s no labor certification for an H1B, e.g. a company isn&#x27;t saying they need that worker so so much. A company just wins the lottery and agrees to pay at least what the DoL says is the prevailing wage for the occupation. If they later want to get a green card for that employee, they have to redo the prevailing wage determination AND make an attempt to hire an citizen&#x2F;GC before they can get the GC (or the employee has to prove they have exceptional skills that gains them international recognition, among other things which includes \"being paid way more than your peers\") reply ajmurmann 18 hours agorootparentprev> Bonus) After reaching a certain threshold of \"taxes paid to the U.S.\" (maybe 300k or something) H1B holders _automatically_ get their green cards.I think this is a good idea in general. One of the main complained about immigration is some supposed cost to the barely-existing US welfare system. Having a minimum lifetime tax before getting access to that seems like a decent compromise to calm down the xenophobes reply appplication 18 hours agorootparentprevThis is practical, but there is some inherently pay-to-play classist issues with handing out green cards to those with money. reply swalberg 18 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s already a category for that, the EB-5 investor visa.If we understand the act of giving a green card to mean the US wants that person to join the society for the long term, is \"taxes paid\" really the best measure of desirability? reply isaacremuant 20 hours agorootparentprev> There is no real downside to this change for anybody in US society.Well, the downside is for the companies exploiting migrants and those are the ones donating money to the people who make decisions. Lobbying is legally bribing them and the effect is that the politicians don&#x27;t represent the people who vote for them but the corporations.And No, this is not a cynical take but a factual one. reply ajmurmann 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure about this.

Even the TN, which is not proclaimed a dual intent is such de facto since the TN visitors don&#x27;t have to prove the lack of immigrant intent either.

This applies regardless of what financial obligations they may have as a renter or homeowner and regardless of the situation of the rest of their family.And if after their job ends they rush out of the country to meet the immigration deadline, any lingering ties to the US will make it harder for them to convince CBP to let them re-enter on visitor status, so the departure may in some circumstances be either temporarily or permanently one-way as well as rushed.The severity of this disruption forces many H-1B workers to meekly put up with a lot more abuse and mistreatment at work than must US citizens, LPRs, and those lucky few categories of nonimmigrants whose work authorizations are not tied to their employment. Agreed, it’s not slavery, but it’s not full freedom either.A more humane approach would be what Canada does: holders of Canadian employer-specific work permits who quit or lose their job are legally allowed to remain in Canada until their current work permit expires, although not to work for a different Canadian employer without first receiving a new permit. They can rely on this predictability of legal status in the country when signing leases, planning their children’s education, and other matters. And it often gives them far more time than the tight US deadline if they want to find a new employer who agrees to sponsor a subsequent work permit for them. reply vinay_ys 20 hours agorootparentprev> H1B is exploiting the rules for cheap labour. It does benefit the H1B holder - since they would otherwise not have signed up.H1B, L1 etc visa schemes make you indentured to the system. The longer you stay and invest in your home and social life (which as a human you have to, otherwise you become a mindless drone), the more you are indentured to the system. Indenture is built into the visa contract – you cannot quit your current employer and stay unemployed even for a short period of time – even though you did contribute social security every single month, even though you paid all taxes every single month – you get no benefits.So, you are in constant fear of losing your job and having to throw away your entire investment here. This means you will be pliable in many ways you would otherwise not be. You can be denied promotions, you can be given shitty&#x2F;grunt work, you can be given borderline unethical work, you can be asked to fire other people in unsympathetic ways, you can be asked to work weekends and nights without any overtime pay, you can be asked to travel very long distances for work in economy class and so on and you shall not complain.You can only suffer silently until you get another job.

They saw an opportunity to unload and they did.I can speak based on Netherlands where I work now. If an employee is performing below expectations, then a conversation needs to be had(documented), given a chance to improve or change course. If after an extended period of attempt, the decision to let that employee go still holds, then they may.However, the above reasoning cannot be made for several employees at once (like the layoffs that occurred).To do an American style layoff, the government will insist on the company to document the reasons why, and in most cases, take away the choice for the company to choose which employee they can let go. Which makes it very unattractive. So, if a company wants to let go of several people at once, they typically offer good severance packages and request the employees to quit. reply clnq 18 hours agorootparentprevWe have labour protections in the UK and this isn&#x27;t a big problem. We can&#x27;t fire people on manager whims and tantrums, and there is more accountability in the process, but not a problem or an obstacle to firing people who are not capable or performing.First, there is the initial probation period. 80% of the people who won&#x27;t perform, won&#x27;t perform in the initial months. You just need a veto system or objective managers and it&#x27;s easy to let slackers go. A lot of managers are soft on their employees and let them pass probation even if their performance is somewhat poor and, frankly, sometimes it&#x27;s obvious it will continue to be poor. This is a mistake. So long as the company doesn&#x27;t make these mistakes, this solves 80% of the matter.Secondly, employees can be put on probation again, or on personal improvement plans. Yes, it can be done for actual performance reasons, not only Google-style. They can then fail these periods if their performance doesn&#x27;t improve. But once again, this needs to be done with a clear head and accountability. This solves another 10% of the matter.Thirdly, you can demote employees so that their pay matches their effort. This probably needs some foresight as demotion requires consent from the employee, if I recall. But if that consent is given as part of the employment contract, it&#x27;s another way to make things just. You pay someone who underperforms less, you use that cash to hire people who perform. This option mitigates the perceived problem in firing under-performers even more.In short, so long as there is good evidence that the employee was underperforming, it&#x27;s not a problem. There are small peculiarities around dealing with this and not exposing the company legally beyond reason. But that&#x27;s true for everything. Just don&#x27;t be a clueless asshole about firing employees, do it when there really is a good reason, and it will all be fine.There are, of course, employees who are vindictive or abuse these laws. But then again, a vindictive employee or one willing to abuse the company into keeping them around is a global problem. Some small % of people will just do these things everywhere - labour protections or not. reply cannabis_sam 14 hours agorootparentprevIf they are not performing their job, they will be fired.Unless by “low performers” you mean the supposedly weakest pawn in some “feelings-based” CEO’s desperate attempt to increase profits. And when that overpaid asshole realizes that he doesn’t actually have any ideas or other ways of impressing the board (which conveniently also consist of overpaid CEOs that think that desperately squeezing employees is the only way forward), shuffling around employees whose jobs he doesn’t understand in the slightest, becomes the way to seem actionable.It’s far easier to get rid of an employee not doing their job, than it is to get rid of a delusional billionaire CEO or boardmember.The real question is how do we get rid of these abysmal, low performing CEOs&#x2F;boardmembers who hide behind idiotic ideas that fuck around with their employees lives or depend on exploiting people from poorer countries, to cover up their own ineptitude?(And no, “shareholders” are just an effigy, conjured to represent private equity and geriatric pension funds, represented by a handful of investment bankers. It’s by definition a dysfunctional market, because the number of actors are tiny, and contained within the same industry. I mean, Adam Smith literally warned us about this…) reply booleandilemma 21 hours agoprevI mean, no kidding. Half the people I work with are H-1B.The program takes jobs away from Americans and should be illegal.I want to work with people from my town, not people from halfway across the world. reply ajmurmann 20 hours agoparent> I want to work with people from my town, not people from halfway across the world.And I want to work with the brightest people from all over the world. I guess we are at an impasse and are best off leaving subjective preferences out... reply bradlys 18 hours agorootparentBrightest in the world definitely isn’t what H1B recruits on. It recruits on who is the most desperate to do hundreds of leetcode problems in order to stay in the country.Go figure, people who want to stay in the country will jump through some ridiculous hoops and we’re all worse for it.I have never found a reason to believe any folks on H1B are smarter than their non-H1B peers. By any stat, never seen it. reply rcme 19 hours agorootparentprevDo you want to work with them even if that means a lower salary? Surely, since you’re among the “brightest in the world” you understand that labor prices are set by supply and demand. The H1B process increases the labor supply and thus decreases the price of labor. reply ajmurmann 18 hours agorootparent> since you’re among the “brightest in the world”I&#x27;m certainly not one of them, but love working with bright people.> you understand that labor prices are set by supply and demand. The H1B process increases the labor supply and thus decreases the price of labor.The pie isn&#x27;t fixed. I believe it will grow and there will be more for everyone if we allow everyone to thrive. New people create demand and maybe reverb start some new companies. Further, the labor could also happen entirely in another country which would be much worse for US workers.IMO the biggest issue with H1B is that it restricts worker choice and thus creates a somewhat captive class of workers who can be paid less. The best way to solve this is to reduce constraints on H1B holders reply rcme 13 hours agorootparentThat’s true. I concede productivity isn’t zero sum. reply hejalajsbsb 21 hours agoparentprevAre you asserting that there is enough American talent to satisfy the job market and that they are being unjustly suppressed? It’s an interesting idea. Do you have any reading relevant to the topic that supports this assertion? reply booleandilemma 21 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. And I would go even further and say that many of the people we hire from overseas aren&#x27;t even that good. They&#x27;re just cheap labor and that&#x27;s what makes them attractive. reply dudul 21 hours agorootparentprevMaybe the article that created this thread? reply o1y32 20 hours agoparentprevIf you are looking for someone to blame for you not getting your dream job, blame it on employers instead of the government. Companies like Verizon and Wells Fargo almost never hire anyone on a visa. Go work for those companies. Oh wait, they do hire foreigners with a green card. Are you going to find a company that only hires US-born citizens like the requirement for the US President?Many countries offer work visas (for many good reasons), although they are often used in unintended ways. It is very much a stretch to say these programs shouldn&#x27;t exist at all because they \"take away\" jobs.Also, if half of the people you work with are on H1B, very likely you are not in a midwest \"town\" with 3,000 population, but rather a decent metropolitan area with a large immigration population, and the company you work is of decent size. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if even half of the Americans in your company relocated from a different \"town\".Finally, I like working with people that are productive and easy to communicate, instead of looking at which country they come from or their visa status. If anything that&#x27;s my boss&#x27;s concern.Therefore, if you want to actually see any change, maybe (1) become the CEO of your company, fire all H1B and only hire US citizens (2) join a different company (3) start your own company, or at least (4) call your senator and advocate for anti-immigration bills, or sue USCIS, instead of posting these useless and borderline racist comments on HN. reply mattrighetti 21 hours agoparentprev> I want to work with people from my townNobody forces you to work with people from across the world, quit your job and find one that only hires people from your town reply iithd-1198 21 hours agorootparentWhat’s the point of a country? To protect and empower its people or to use them to empower a rich few at the top?As it is, the H1B system only benefits H1Bs in a limited manner at the cost of American citizens. All so that rich investors can make more money. reply C6JEsQeQa5fCjE 15 hours agorootparentThe latter. To think otherwise is to ignore thousands of years of human history that has consistently proved it through many different forms of government. Whatever the initial idea of any new system of government might be, after a few generations it degenerates into serving the elites first and foremost. The problem is human nature. reply booleandilemma 21 hours agorootparentprevSounds impractical to me. In fact every company I&#x27;ve worked for is flooded with non-Americans. It would be tough to find a company that only hires Americans.I think a better solution is to end H-1B. Nobody is forcing people to come here. reply mattrighetti 14 hours agorootparent> Nobody is forcing people to come here.That&#x27;s the whole point, that&#x27;s why H1B is apparently still very popular. People will take lower salaries just to get to the US because they apparently want to move there at all cost and have a chance to stay. reply polski-g 19 hours agorootparentprevWork for defense&#x2F;intelligence contractors. 100% of the people they hire are Americans. reply inemesitaffia 20 hours agorootparentprevSpaceX apparently reply iepathos 21 hours agoparentprevUS has historically low unemployment past several years so idk who you think they are taking jobs away from but most let go are almost immediately re-hired elsewhere.

I&#x27;m not sure why Google having a lot of people from other countries is bad if it makes money from those countries).(Btw, I see your point and am not necessarily criticizing it. However, you do see that these companies operate globally and having the workforce reflect that should be considered ok?) reply Zetice 20 hours agoparentprevWhy are Americans more deserving of jobs then other people? reply orochimaaru 20 hours agorootparentBecause a nation should put its citizens interests first. This isn’t a hard concept.There’s plenty of companies though that don’t do h1b. Major telcos, defense contractors (those are us citizen only), a lot of small hedge funds, etc. reply Zetice 20 hours agorootparentNo, a nation should not put just its citizens first, that’s nationalistic garbage. Firstly it presumes a nation decides who its citizens are through some fair system, and secondly it presumes its citizens are somehow inherently more deserving than its non citizens.Anyone who agrees to the social contract gets to benefit from the nation. That’s what a country actually is. reply MAGZine 20 hours agorootparentYour premise is flawed. If I create a new nation and my nations social contact is one norm: no outsiders, then you can&#x27;t simply be a national by agreeing to the contract.In practice, nations prioritize their own citizens, in the same way you will prioritize your family. Do you abandon taking care of your family because it would be \"more fair,\" to take care of someone on the other side of the planet?Your countrymen should have aligned values, cultures, goals, missions, etc that prioritizes them. That&#x27;s the fabric of society. reply Zetice 19 hours agorootparentThe problem you’re ignoring is that there is not a 1:1 correlation between citizenship and people who agree to the social contract.Everyone who gives up freedom to the state is entering into a social contract with that state, citizenship or no. Once those people enter into that contract, they deserve all of the rights and services the contract provides.By tying the contract to citizenship, you provide a way for racists and nationalists to steal from the people arbitrarily determined to be noncitizens, usually along racial lines. reply vacuity 18 hours agorootparentAt the same time, if a surplus of noncitizens enter and suddenly the country&#x27;s ability to provide for all of its people is strained, wouldn&#x27;t that be a grave disservice to the citizens? What would be the difference between a citizen and a noncitizen then? Not that a country like the US is reasonably providing for a large portion of the populace anyways, so I suppose that&#x27;s a moot point right now. reply Zetice 18 hours agorootparentNo, as these people who are part of the influx, once accepting the social contract, are no better or worse than anyone else who has agreed to the social contract, citizen or no.Besides, all evidence suggests immigrants benefit a society substantially more than they harm it. In the US for example, noncitizens consume significantly fewer national resources while still paying the full amount of taxes expected of citizens. reply vacuity 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t deny that immigrants are beneficial at the moment. However, some people aren&#x27;t going to have jobs. Besides, it&#x27;s not as if noncitizens should be paid less just because they can survive with those wages. I&#x27;m saying that if the US actually cared for all of its people, I&#x27;ll say present immigrants included, there won&#x27;t be room for an arbitrary number of new immigrants. Are you going to try to stretch that limit until something bad happens? I have no interest in excluding people of \"other races\" or something like that, but pragmatically, I think the line needs to be drawn somewhere at some point. reply Zetice 18 hours agorootparentThere is no \"pragmatic\" limit. As more people arrive, more jobs are needed to support them, more jobs are made available as a larger pool of workers able to do a wider variety of tasks for wages that allow for corporations to turn a profit. It&#x27;s a self sustaining cycle.The general rule here is that unless there&#x27;s an obvious reason to deny equal people something you&#x27;ve given other people, you shouldn&#x27;t deny it in the first place. reply vacuity 18 hours agorootparent> The general rule here is that unless there&#x27;s an obvious reason to deny equal people something you&#x27;ve given other people, you shouldn&#x27;t deny it in the first place.Of course. The problem is that your view of the economy is optimistic, perhaps dangerously so. Let&#x27;s hope we never reach the limit and have a concrete problem on our hands, I guess. reply Zetice 18 hours agorootparentMy view is not optimistic, it&#x27;s reflective of reality. reply HAL3000 16 hours agorootparentThis viewpoint appears somewhat naive and unrealistic. It&#x27;s important to consider that there are literally billions of people who might be willing to make certain sacrifices and agree, or at least pretend to agree, to a social contract just to migrate to the US. What would happen in such a scenario? Society could collapse. To get a clearer perspective on this, it&#x27;s worth examining what started happening in the European Union around 2015 when there was a substantial influx of immigrants from Africa and Asia. It created huge social tensions. Look at the rising crime rates in Sweden (majority from immigrants, that&#x27;s not some right wing propaganda but actual statistics, just google it), the increased popularity of far-right parties like AFD in Germany or neo nazi parties in France or Italy. I am grateful that this perspective is in the minority because the consequences of the proposed decisions could potentially harm society. There will always be individuals who exploit divisions and tensions between groups to gain power. Don&#x27;t forget that Hitler was elected in democratic society. reply Zetice 16 hours agorootparentSociety would not even come close to collapsing, that is unrealistic. reply vacuity 18 hours agorootparentprevAs much as a weather forecaster&#x27;s is, I suppose. reply Zetice 17 hours agorootparentI’m not predicting anything. replyi_am_a_peasant 19 hours agorootparentprevPreach it fellow human. I sometimes am baffled by how little a damn people in privileged positions can give about others. All they&#x27;re interested in is preserving their position of privilege, and their political views and philosophy on life will typically reflect that. Personally I would give citizenship and a free house to any good hearted hard working individual and not give a damn where they come from. Our whole society would benefit if we didn&#x27;t have to waste so much of our brain power just on surviving. reply manuelabeledo 19 hours agorootparentprev> Your countrymen should have aligned values, cultures, goals, missions, etc that prioritizes them.

You wouldn’t pretend like the US granting and then revoking citizenship from Mexican settlers repeatedly in the 19th and 20th century was acceptable, would you? Was the Chinese Exclusion Act acceptable?A foreign life is worth exactly the same as an American life, and the difference is completely arbitrary. reply dudul 20 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re now blatantly strawmaning. Nobody is talking about the value of a life or people being superior to others. We&#x27;re discussing employment policies. reply Zetice 19 hours agorootparentThat’s exactly what is being discussed, even if you don’t realize what it is you’re saying.Americans are not more deserving of jobs than foreigners, Americans are not better than foreigners. reply peteradio 19 hours agorootparentAmericans are free to rule their country as they wish that is basically the premise it&#x27;s founded on. Deserve means nothing in this context. reply Zetice 19 hours agorootparentDeserve means everything in this context, because I, as an American, am discussing with my fellow Americans how our country works and the principles upon which we ought to rule ourselves.Those principles are heavily founded in “deserve”. You are watching some infinitesimally small part of that “ruling” process. reply jimmygrapes 18 hours agorootparentCitizenship is meant to limit external actors influencing the vote of who should represent the people of any given area, and being qualified to represent the people by virtue of a sustained commitment and longevity. reply Zetice 18 hours agorootparentNo, it&#x27;s meant to determine which people have agreed to the social contract. Citizenship is not some sacred thing you must earn; simply agreeing to give up some freedom is all it takes to benefit from the social programs offered by a government.The bureaucratic concept of \"citizenship\" is just a way for people to construct barriers of hate around the benefits offered by a nation while still forcing people to accept the sacrifices. reply nec4b 16 hours agorootparentAre you putting other people before your family, friends or neighbors? reply Zetice 16 hours agorootparentMy family and neighbors aren’t occupying 3.7 million square miles and aren’t numbered in the hundreds of millions, so the analogy does not hold. reply nec4b 13 hours agorootparentAt what square footage does it start holding then?

Certainly there&#x27;s a moral obligation to not unduly wrong others in the course of that pursuit, but it is contrary to the mission of a government to benefit foreigners at the expense of its own population. reply Zetice 19 hours agorootparentThe purpose of government is to provide social goods to everyone who agreed to give up some freedoms to be part of that government.Non citizens have equal right to feed their families, and anyone who has agreed to the social contract has equal rights to the social services the government has agreed to provide, regardless of citizenship. reply dudul 19 hours agorootparentprevDo you have walls and doors in your house? reply Zetice 19 hours agorootparentIdiotic argument, nobody&#x27;s house is 3.7 million sq miles, nor do 350 million people live in anybody&#x27;s \"house\". reply nec4b 16 hours agorootparentSo it&#x27;s inconvenient for you to open your house to anyone? reply Zetice 15 hours agorootparentIf my house were like a country, it would be quite convenient and I would indeed open my home to everyone willing to participate in my social contract.But my home isn’t in any way like a country, so this question isn’t meaningful. reply nec4b 13 hours agorootparentSo your logic doesn&#x27;t apply for your home, for your neighborhood or your city?

In the United States, public bathrooms can be hard to find, with only eight public toilets for every 100,000 people. In this comic, we explain why that’s a problem for the millions of Americans suffering from medical conditions, as well as people who are unhoused, older adults, pregnant individuals and more.

Winter came, traffic levelled off, and it didn&#x27;t spike again this summer (though it has remained stable).I tried to track whether it was OK to use the washroom without a purchase, wheelchair accessibility, size. When I worked at McDonald&#x27;s, an executive told me they wanted their customers to know there was always a bathroom they could use anywhere in the world even if they weren&#x27;t making a purchase this visit.AFAIK, Starbucks had a similar policy for a long time.It was interesting to see how some locations featured immediately locked down their washrooms.I had a Tim Hortons franchise owner email me and freak out, so we marked her location as \"purchase required.\"It&#x27;s been pretty brutal here with the meth crisis, though, so I also get it.At the end of the day, I would love for our governments to provide taxpayer funded facilities around the city and even on several of our major highways. We used to have a lot here but they closed almost all of them.You can check it out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.winnipee.com reply rawgabbit 16 hours agoparentA few years ago I visited three different McDonalds in Washington DC. All three were newly renovated in downtown.All three restrooms were unlocked and disgusting. After notifying the staff I figured out some homeless would vent their rage by literally smearing their feces on the walls. When the staff clean it up, they would do it again. reply Gunnerhead 13 hours agorootparentThat’s seriously disgusting. But even without mental illness, you still have people that seem like they don’t know bathroom etiquette. I worked at a retailer during college that had a public bathroom, seemingly normal people still did the most disgusting messes in the toilets that I was left to clean. reply dylan604 14 hours agorootparentprevThe McDonalds in downtown Dallas, at least for a time, played classical music outside as well as inside. The theory was that the homeless wouldn&#x27;t hang around as much. This was back in the 80s when my mom worked downtown, and it was common water cooler conversation. I&#x27;m sure as a manager, you&#x27;re pretty much willing to try anything to avoid the situation you&#x27;ve described.

The first modern try was the JCDecaux self-cleaning street toilets. (JCDecaux is really an ad company. The street toilets are just a way to get ads on public property.) The first problem was that that the US required them to be wheelchair-accessable. So they were 3x as big and several times more expensive than the smaller units in Paris.[1]They are noted for working fine in tourist areas, and badly in homeless areas. Making them big enough for wheelchair accessibility makes them big enough for drug deals, too. They&#x27;re also far too expensive. The cleaning machinery is standard industrial automation equipment from Telemechanique. I&#x27;ve seen one opened for servicing. If you built a washing machine that way, it would cost $20,000. It requires power, water, and a phone line.There&#x27;s the Portland Loo.[2] This is designed for maximum homeless proofing. Graffiti-resistant. Gratings at top and bottom instead of solid walls, for reduced privacy. It&#x27;s not self-cleaning, but can be hosed down or pressure-washed. Only needs a water line; power requirements are low enough to be supplied by a solar panel. “It’s not supposed to be a comfortable place” - Portland Loo sales manager.

Your standard urban mcdonalds or other new construction building will have full bathrooms by code on the other hand. And if there is some code or whatever, just ask.

    "originBody": "Home About Invest with Ben My Books Animal Spirits Podcast Contact The U.S. Housing Market vs. The Canadian Housing Market Posted September 8, 2023 by Ben Carlson Way back in 2017, I wrote about how bananas Canadian housing prices were. This was the chart I used at the time: Canada basically skipped the housing bust from the Great Financial Crisis. Well, things got even more bananas in the ensuing years. Here’s the updated version: Canadian housing prices can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent or something like that. The crazy thing is Canadian housing prices would have to fall an additional 40%+ from those levels just to get back in line with growth in real U.S. housing prices since 1975. Since the start of 2005, Canadian home prices are up a staggering 142% on a real basis (after inflation). And that includes a decrease of 19% in the final 9 months of 2022.1 From 2005-2022, U.S. housing prices were up just shy of 26% on a real basis. Housing price gains in Canada make the U.S. housing price gain look tiny by comparison. The year-by-year gains and losses stand out here as well: Bigger gains and bigger losses in Canada. It’s like the S&P 500 versus the Nasdaq 100. The differences between the two markets look even more stark when you compare the real gains in housing prices to real gains in disposable income over time: I used the same scale for both to highlight the differences here. Yes, real housing prices are now growing faster than real disposable income in the United States but that relationship has been relatively stable for the past 50 years or so. Incomes have kept pace with housing prices after accounting for inflation. But things in Canada have gone completely off the rails over the past 20 years or so. Our kind neighbors to the north are in a completely different stratosphere than we are. I’m not saying this makes it any easier if you’re looking to buy in the U.S. right now. Affordability here is still as bad as it’s ever been. We just hit another new all-time high in average monthly payment (via Redfin): Just be thankful you’re not trying to buy a house in Canada…it’s even worse there.

I live here and quite like it. It&#x27;s been my home for eight years.Similar units in the same building now sell for $1.2m.This means that my family&#x27;s wealth has increased by $75,000 per year just from owning our home. That&#x27;s more than the median income in Canada!I don&#x27;t say this to gloat. I say this as an example of how badly wrong things are. Nothing about this is sustainable. If it continues for another decade, we can presume no young person today will ever be able to afford a home. reply stouset 16 hours agoparent> This means that my family&#x27;s wealth has increased by $75,000 per year just from owning our home.Sort of, but in practice not really (particularly when interest rates are higher, like now). The only meaningful way to realize that extra wealth is to sell. But then you’ve got to live somewhere, but everywhere else has (on average) gotten proportionally more expensive too. The only way to really capture that wealth is to downgrade or to go to an area that has underperformed, neither of which are typically appealing options, nor are they generally aligned with our notions of “increased personal wealth”.What’s really happened is that non-homeowners have effectively gotten effectively poorer since their only options are to pay increasingly-large rents or buy at inflated prices. reply epistasis 16 hours agorootparentNo, this is purely wealth, it&#x27;s not a \"sort of\" it&#x27;s the actual real wealth just like a bag of diamonds in a safe.Indeed, homes are some of the most liquid form of wealth, easily leveraged with loans to buy even more property. And home values are one thing that governments are most likely to protect through drastic policy changes. Sure, you can take out a loan backed by your diamonds, but it won&#x27;t be on terms as good as that of your home.Home wealth really is one of the strongest forms of wealth there is, and people trying to pretend it is not have no concept of how lucky they are, or even what wealth really means.People without this wealth are forced to pay their rent to others, who accept both the rent and then the real estate gains. reply stouset 15 hours agorootparent> People without this wealth are forced to pay their rent to others, who accept both the rent and then the real estate gains.I note this in that not owning results in being beholden to increasing rents and at a cost disadvantage in buying a future home.But the property value gains are hard to realize in a meaningful way. Yes, you can potentially leverage your equity into acquiring more homes. But real estate gains have traditionally lagged the stock market. So as you continue this cycle, you increase your leverage dramatically while investing in highly-correlated and slightly underperforming assets.Meanwhile, little of these gains are able to be used for actual lifestyle improvements until you start unloading these properties. reply epistasis 15 hours agorootparentWell the location is the lifestyle. If the homeowner doesn&#x27;t value the location as much as all the wealthy people clamoring for a spot in the neighborhood, yet they still hold onto their home, it truly is a bad allocation of resources among people.None of these homeowners would even consider the option of selling their home and renting it from the purchaser, because it is so obviously a bad idea in every way. But their blindness to the alternative is also indicative of just how amazing a form of wealth is.Super wealthy people are always convincing themselves that they are not wealthy, because they always see others with a higher level of lifestyle. I knew an older man who had built an empire of hotels, but because he wasn&#x27;t Hilton, he always felt like a failure despite never flying commercial, owning mansions across the world, and being surrounded by servants at his beck and call.When people have raised their wealth without their lifestyle \"changing,\" yet they can now move nearly anywhere else and have a massive lifestyle improvement in consumption, without the location they were in, they somehow trick themselves into thinking this is not wealth. reply jjav 2 hours agorootparent> they still hold onto their home, it truly is a bad allocation of resources among people.The above statement assumes that a home is nothing but a cold investment decision.A home is a place to live and a neighborhood to grow older in. It is not an \"allocation of resources\".People hold on to their home because they like it there, they like the neighbors, their kids like their friends in the area and so on. It is not a financial decision. It&#x27;s a home. This is often lost in these discussions. reply dukeyukey 31 minutes agorootparentA home is all those that things, but it&#x27;s also a scarce resource that costs a lot to build and that we don&#x27;t have enough of. So for every market inefficiency we accept on the basis that a home is special (which isn&#x27;t wrong!) we accept some level of people dying in the streets, or young people being pushed out of their hometowns, or families never being started. reply kjkjadksj 14 hours agorootparentprevI think you are forgetting the most common way people realize this: sell house for gain, use money to afford down payment on nicer home, perhaps enough to end up paying a similar monthly payment in the end. People act like you need to go from paid off house to paid off house but thats hardly the case. Partially paid off house to even less paid off house is common especially if you know you will be working for another few decades. reply lazide 14 hours agorootparentprevUh, home equity lines of credit are a thing in most places. They certainly are in the US!Also, renting out rooms. Also ‘granny flats’, etc. reply raydev 4 hours agorootparentHELOC isn&#x27;t free money. You have to pay it back. Unless you&#x27;re suggesting that you use the money to make bets. reply squeaky-clean 5 hours agorootparentprevMy parents bought their house for $150k in Miami in the 90&#x27;s. They sold it last year for 800k. Then moved to a cheaper town in central Florida where they got a place for 200k. reply HWR_14 14 hours agorootparentprev> real estate gains have traditionally lagged the stock marketDoes that take into account the relative ease and long term leveraging in real estate vs. the stock market? reply lumost 14 hours agorootparentConsidering the above scenario where real estate is gaining at 75k per year. A wealthy individual could easily leaver themselves to 75*5 = 375k&#x2F;yr. Using the starting cost of a home at 600k, this would equate to an average rate of return of about 300%Such rates of returns are simply impossible in the general stock market without getting very lucky. reply stouset 9 hours agorootparentprevYou can lever yourself in the stock market too. reply jjav 3 hours agorootparentprev> Indeed, homes are some of the most liquid form of wealthReal estate is not a liquid asset by the definition of that term. Example:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;032715&#x2F;what-items-a...(Jewelry (as in your diamonds) are not liquid assets either.)A primary residence is even less liquid for the reasons PP stated. Sure, you can sell it but then what? You still have to live somewhere so you can&#x27;t use that money for something else, you&#x27;d have to buy another home at which point the money is locked up in real estate again. The only time you can extract that wealth into cash is if you can downsize to a much smaller home, or move to a much cheaper area.So yes, a primary home is real wealth, but it is as far from liquid as any form of wealth can be. reply twic 12 hours agorootparentprev> Indeed, homes are some of the most liquid form of wealth\"Liquid\" means fast to sell without giving a deep discount. Homes are far less liquid than listed securities. reply bell-cot 15 hours agorootparentprev> ...actual real wealth just like a bag of diamonds in a safe.Vs. the grim reality:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fortune.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;diamond-demand-falling-lab-gr... reply epistasis 15 hours agorootparentAnd if this was happening to home values, there would be a panic in the legislature and all sorts of policy to stop it and preserve home wealth.Which is one of the reasons it rubs me so wrong when people think their homes are not a form of wealth. reply therealdrag0 14 hours agorootparentprevNice example of supply&#x2F;demand and why we just need to build more units. reply quicklime 10 hours agorootparentprev> And home values are one thing that governments are most likely to protect through drastic policy changes100%. Home owners are one of the most selfish voting blocs out there, and will punish politicians for not perpetuating unsustainable policies at the expense of the greater social good. That makes it a very good investment, at least until society completes its transition away from capitalism to a new kind of feudalism. reply fallingknife 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not, though. Since 1970 home prices in the US have gone up 16x and the S&P 500 has gone up 44x. Adjusted for inflation, that&#x27;s 2x for houses and 5.5x for stocks. And you don&#x27;t have to sell your stock if you have to move (and take a 6% hit on RE agent commissions) or pay money to maintain it. You can borrow against it whenever you want with just the click of a button. Of course housing sounds like a great form of wealth when you compare it to the hilariously bad investment of a bag of diamonds in a safe. reply epistasis 14 hours agorootparentThese calculations ignore that most homes are eligible for extreme amounts of highly protected leverage. Sure, you can trade on margin on the stock market, but you are subject to margin calls, which is not the case with a home.So multiple that 16x by the typical 4x-5x leveraging, and homes turn out to be really great. And since the transaction fees and the non-existence of index funds in the 1970s made it harder to invest in the stock market at a small scale, and homes were a much better investment.Add on to that that everybody needs a place to live, and your home acting as an investment vehicle with equivalent performance to the US stock market, and people from the 1970s have had had an amazing deal that younger people have not had access to. reply compiler-guy 13 hours agorootparentAll that leverage absolutely crushed investors in the 2008 housing crash, and is again now ruining people who had poor or nonexistent interest rate hedges.The idea that it’s easy or natural to make money via leveraged housing had ruined many people. reply ozr 11 hours agorootparentThis isn&#x27;t really a thing in the US right now. Less than 10% of mortgages are adjustable. The share of ARMs in 08 was much, much higher. reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparent*&#x2F;1 ARMs are insane and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed in the market.*&#x2F;5s or even *&#x2F;3s offer an interesting option, depending on terms. reply refurb 8 hours agorootparentprevYup, people don&#x27;t realize that leverage works both way. It&#x27;s not a freebie. reply fallingknife 14 hours agorootparentprevBut you have to put that capital in anyway because house leverage is amortizing. Margin debt is not. reply kjkjadksj 14 hours agorootparentprevYou are looking at avg gain. I can tell you anecdotally that over the past 25 years there have been markets that have barely budged at all in median prices, and markets that have seen fold change gains in median home prices. In some markets you are doing a lot worse than the index, in others you handily beat the index and these are generally the ones people bemoan in cost of living articles in the media. reply max51 14 hours agorootparentprevThe difference here is that you would make 44x from the spare change you can save every month after paying for rent, not from a loan worth >5x your yearly salary. reply fallingknife 14 hours agorootparentA loan which you have to pay back with interest. So unless home prices are rising faster than interest rates, you&#x27;re losing on that deal reply ozr 11 hours agorootparentYes, but:1) Historically they have.2) Most people in the US that haven&#x27;t purchased very recently are locked in at very low rates. Only 9% of mortgages are over 6%. 61% of outstanding mortages areThe only meaningful way to realize that extra wealth is to sellThis is true only on first approximation. On second approximation rent prices are positively correlated with property prices. This means that rent_amount &#x2F; mortgage >>> 1 and if you rent the place out you can essentially get passive income. You are correct that you still need to live somewhere and that is going to come at a cost which will eat up the passive income, but effective rent will still be lower.Another option is to realize that lower mortgage compared to equivalent rent means that extra cash is freed up towards other things. This can either be extra investments every month, experiences such as traveling the world, or even a lower paying job with a lot less stress. reply psunavy03 15 hours agorootparentThe problem these days, though, is that the equity in House 1 is often needed to buy House 2 if you move, otherwise you&#x27;re dipping into your nest egg for a second down payment, which is not financially wise. Equities generally have a higher rate of return than real estate.Also, multiple homes mean multiple maintenance bills, and also the potential for bad tenants wrecking the place. I had a rental property in the past and had to spend multiple thousand dollars staging it for sale because, renters generally DGAF about maintenance, and property managers get lazy and do the bare minimum to get it rented. reply creato 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t see the problem here. You aren&#x27;t entitled to ownership of multiple houses. Being forced to sell one house in order to buy another one sounds like working as intended to me. reply psunavy03 15 hours agorootparentMy point was that \"rent it out and print money\" doesn&#x27;t always work. I did it with a home I owned, but that was also a period of time where I was a) bouncing around the country renting the roof over my own head and b) waiting to sell after taking it in the shorts value-wise during the Great Recession. I was never underwater, but would have taken a huge capital loss for awhile if I&#x27;d sold. reply stouset 15 hours agorootparentprevBut that’s entirely my point. It’s hard to actually realize these gains in practice since when you sell your house, the increase in value is absorbed by buying your next residence, which has on average also inflated in value. reply pc86 14 hours agorootparentprevYou aren&#x27;t entitled to ownership of a single house, either. reply mabbo 16 hours agorootparentprev> The only meaningful way to realize that extra wealth is to sell. But then you’ve got to live somewhereWhich is one of many reasons we&#x27;re considering leaving Toronto reply tempsy 17 hours agoparentprevCanada’s housing market is much more vulnerable to “popping” than the US because everyone’s mortgage rate resets every 5 years.Let me know what happens to prices when everyone has to pay 8% soon. reply 01100011 11 hours agorootparentLosses will be socialized like they always are.

Or if there are special elections where only homeowners can vote, could you give some citations to those?AFAIK everyone gets one vote, regardless of home ownership status. Am I wrong? reply aquaticsunset 17 hours agorootparentprevUnless legislation changes, investors will just scoop up the sales and keep property values high. It&#x27;s a pessimistic take but I don&#x27;t see any deviation from this path (in Canada and the US). reply tempsy 16 hours agorootparentInvestors paying 8% can’t make the math work either. reply aquaticsunset 16 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re not getting mortgages. All cash purchases are extremely high right now (roughly 30% of all home sales in the US). They can fleece us for \"modest\" rent increases every year, conveniently just less than 8%, while property values stay high because these investors are able to gobble up the housing stock.Without legislation dissuading this behavior, home ownership will continue to be increasingly difficult for working people. reply HWR_14 14 hours agorootparent\"All cash\" just means \"no contingency on financing\". It rarely means \"will not be financed\". reply kevin_nisbet 16 hours agorootparentprevI think the only good news I heard in this area in the US, is one of the big companies doing this was going bust because they screwed up their calculations for how much to offer when buying homes. So if the companies just can&#x27;t make the math work and go bust that would also be a good outcome here. reply xhkkffbf 12 hours agorootparentprevIT just differently mortgaged. It&#x27;s not a direct mortgage, but the company that&#x27;s buying these had to raise the capital one way or another. And if the company didn&#x27;t buy a house, they have the choice in investing it in something else. If the bonds are paying 8%, the company must believe that the house will return even more which is pretty hard. reply ddorian43 14 hours agorootparentprevPretty sure investors buying have dropped by 50% according to &#x2F;r&#x2F;rebubble reply CapitalistCartr 16 hours agorootparentprevBut as the quote says, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. reply mattnewton 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy would they pay 8%?

You still only have 1 condo unit of wealth regardless of its nominal currency value and you have to live somewhere. So if you sold it you&#x27;d just have to buy another unit or house somewhere anyway.But this collective delusion that the house prices of homeowners has gone up is a huge part of the problem, in part because if house prices halved, it would be a huge problem but probably not as large as people think, mainly because people can largely just walk away from underwater mortgages (in Canada AFAIK).The only people who benefit are those hoarding real estate, not individual homeowners.

The commenter I replied to buy a condo for just shy of C$600k. At that time maybe a house they might move up to was $900k. $300k is a lot but probably doable.

One of the biggest issues that is almost never talked about is development (land improvement?) taxes occur late in the process. So when it comes to multi-dwelling development, there is substantial risk the developers have to take on and manage, because they could get slapped with losing all their profits in surprise taxes near the end of the project (besides all the risks for building costs in general). I think the stats is in the ballpark of 2&#x2F;10 building are successes, 6&#x2F;10 are break even, and 2&#x2F;10 are are losses. At $100-$400 million a piece for a medium sized tower, imagine taking on that risk profile... I can&#x27;t. So cities need to understand the risks they&#x27;re transferring to development, and fund their infrastructure upgrades through good and solid planning upfront.Another related idea I saw from a youtube video on Vancouver I think it was, was the return to the Vancouver standard house plan. It was one of the post war house plans, and while there were a couple variations and you could make superficial changes, it was extremely cheap to get approvals for because the city was basically approving the same structure every time, and were so used to it the reviews were cheap and easy.So you&#x27;re right, just finding the opportunities to optimize that process for both the City and Developer is essential. And also allowing basement apartments and other medium density development. The giant towers are hella expensive if that&#x27;s the only density getting built. reply Havelock 11 hours agoparentprevI believe that the current housing bubble began to really go off the rails during the 2008 financial crisis due to decisions made by the Conservative Party of Canada at that time.

Subsequent governments have followed a similar path.As we&#x27;ve seen, the accumulated potential energy in the housing market has now grown to such an extent that we don&#x27;t know what to do with it.

In Canada, you don&#x27;t pay capital gains on the sale of your home. In the USA you do if the gain was over $250k ($500k if you&#x27;re married). So this creates a huge incentive in Canada to buy a house, renovate it while you live there, and then sell it and apply the entire gain to your next purchase.It means Canadians who are already in the system can afford a lot more house in their subsequent purchases, especially at the high end. reply larsnystrom 16 hours agoparentCapital gains taxes on your primary residence stops older people (who have large unrealized gains in the home they own) from selling their large, built-to-accommodate-a-family house to buy something smaller in a more convenient location. They’re not able to buy something in the same price bracket after selling, because of capital gains taxes. So old people stay in their large homes and younger people, who would actually need that larger house, can’t get into the market.I would think dropping capital gains taxes on your primary residence, and have a property tax that scales with the market value of your home, would make the housing market more efficient. reply jedberg 16 hours agorootparentIt makes it more efficient by allowing the price to go more towards the natural price, which is high due to lack of inventory.It keeps prices suppressed in the USA for exactly the reason you say -- old people won&#x27;t sell their high end homes, which keeps the median price lower. reply surge 15 hours agorootparentprevJust wave the tax if you&#x27;re over a certain age or collect SS.

Seems to me, that incentivizes Americans to over-leverage on paying mortgage interest. Don&#x27;t worry though, in Canada these days, we too over-leverage on mortgages, because otherwise we&#x27;re homeless, as per the article.

The country should be building brand new cities and linking them up with high-speed rail. But, even if that plan were shovel-ready today -- which it definitely, definitely isn&#x27;t! -- it would still take years before it contributed to the solution, and all the while, the demand is continuing to grow!The seeds of the supply solution to today&#x27;s housing crisis needed to be planted at least ten years ago. But it wasn&#x27;t, so we can plant those seeds now, but they&#x27;ll take time to come to fruition. In the meantime, the only fast-acting measures are demand-side measures. And having to deploy demand-side measures is a very tragic consequence of not having taken timely action on the supply side. And that&#x27;s even assuming we can plant those seeds today: if the city council squabbling about setbacks and floor-space-ratios continues today, then those seeds still aren&#x27;t being planted, the demand-side measures will unfortunately need to last even longer, and the vitality of the country will suffer for it. reply lifechoseme123 11 hours agorootparentprev\"make accommodations available\"do you mean make housing available?

There is a collective delusion that has sustained some profoundly self destructive policies. The toll is coming due.Almost all of Canada cannot qualify for a home at current housing prices. Either to buy or to rent. The rental market is currently at the level of parody where the requirements filter out almost everyone. The bottom 50% of Canada, income wise, is in the precarious situation where if anything happens to their current housing, they will be homeless. Slowly social assistance and related programs are going to have to start resetting and the costs are going to be enormous.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;4xWtCThis is a problem created by multiple governments over various parties, and at this point I don&#x27;t see an exit that isn&#x27;t enormously painful. reply remarkEon 15 hours agoparent>Almost all of Canada cannot qualify for a home at current housing prices.How are you quantifying this? If this is true, how is it not reflected in some manner in prices? In other words, who are are the buyers propping up prices?I&#x27;m not trolling, because if what you&#x27;re saying is true it suggests that there is something fundamentally fraudulent about the Canadian housing market. reply Fervicus 15 hours agorootparentCanadian housing market is full of fraud at all levels, from people falsifying incomes, to real estate agents, to money laundering [0].[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reca.ca&#x2F;consumers&#x2F;financial-considerations&#x2F;money... reply ttul 13 hours agorootparentprevMy household is in the top 1% of income earners. We cannot afford a house in our exurb. 20 years ago, with this level of income, it would have been trivially affordable.Yes, I rent for $4250 a home that you can buy for $1.7M. The distortion here is beyond ridiculous. The equivalent mortgage would be something like $7K before property taxes and maintenance.Because you can’t imagine government moving fast enough to change policy, the only way out is likely a sudden and shocking collapse in home values caused by the bond market failing to continue its belief that Canada is sound. reply nucleardog 8 hours agorootparentI was renting a $1.4m home for $2200&#x2F;mo in Vancouver. Something like a $10k&#x2F;mo mortgage payment for 25 years at current rates. But they had bought it like 6 or 7 years before so _their_ mortgage was substantially lower.We haven’t even seen the full brunt of this—every time one of these properties changes hands at this point as the current owner cashes out, we’re going to see one more of these “affordable” rentals off the market in one way or another. (Either they hike the rent to the point of unaffordability, occupy it themselves, or leave it sit empty to just store or accumulate value.)And just to put it in some perspective—to afford that shitty run down house I was renting, you’d need to be making somewhere around $720k&#x2F;yr pre-tax to pay the mortgage and maintain the “1&#x2F;3 toward housing” ratio. People in Canada do not make $720k&#x2F;yr. reply ttul 6 hours agorootparentAbsolutely this. A friend considers herself too poor to afford a house in Vancouver. Her company makes $10M a year and she peels off 10% net profit. Only in Vancouver… reply shagmin 15 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t have a source on me but I&#x27;ve read plenty about wealthy people in other countries buying large amounts of Canadian real estate as a store of value, even if it sits vacant. Mostly people in countries where there aren&#x27;t so many great places to invest. But I don&#x27;t know off hand if that&#x27;s just a drop in the bucket compared to other things or what. reply cscurmudgeon 15 hours agorootparentThat is just vanilla racism&#x2F;xenophobia.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.westernu.ca&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;expert-insight-canadas-ban-....Data that tracks foreign buyers and owners in Canada are scarce and patchy. The Canadian Housing Statistics Program shows that non-residents only own about two to six per cent of Canadian residential properties in 2020.Edit: Those numbers are in line with the US. Why is the US real estate market not that crazy then? reply electrondood 14 hours agorootparentNo, it is a fact. The same happens in the US.Real estate is, at worst, used for sanction evasion and money laundering, and at best, as a loophole for citizens of restrictive countries to extract more of their money from those countries.All of these create an incentive to overbid on real estate.Where I live, this is a known issue. In fact, the top real estate companies specifically try to attract foreign investors, and have stated so publicly.Look at the chart in the article. Home prices plummeted in 2022, when the Canadian government enacted a 1% Underused Housing Tax (UHT) on Canadian residential property that is considered vacant or underused.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sgp.fas.org&#x2F;crs&#x2F;misc&#x2F;IF11967.pdf[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;the-impact-of-treasurys-p...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;us&#x2F;us-set-unveil-long-awaited-...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gfintegrity.org&#x2F;press-release&#x2F;new-report-finds-u-s-r...[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.faegredrinker.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;insights&#x2F;publications&#x2F;2023&#x2F;...[5] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lewisbrisbois.com&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;legal-alerts&#x2F;foreign-inve... reply cscurmudgeon 5 hours agorootparent> No, it is a fact.

Now, there is still the question of why there is a shortage, but 2 to 6 percent in an already tight market is more than enough to spike the prices.Of course, China shows that you don&#x27;t need outsider investing to create a ridiculous property affordability situation. reply gemstones 15 hours agorootparentprevThe buyers are foreign to Canada (investors), so the effects don’t affect the Canadian economy as directly as you might expect. reply swarnie 15 hours agorootparentprevThe R&#x2F;canada subreddit had a good breakdown last weekEssentially 92% of Canadians can&#x27;t afford the average home based on the average income.I think if you do \"top\" of the last month it&#x27;ll be near the top. reply mdorazio 12 hours agoparentprevYour link was heavy on opinion and light on data, so I went looking for numbers on Canada to verify your assessment.Median income after taxes: $68,400 [1] Median rent (2 bedroom): $2,300 [2] Average tax rate (single worker): ~32% [3]If we apply the 30% rule (it&#x27;s ok to spend up to 30% of pre-tax earnings spend on rent), your assertion doesn&#x27;t hold up - well over 50% of Canadians are making plenty of money to afford rent. Of course, in expensive cities where rents have far outpaced wages things are going to be bad but that&#x27;s true pretty much everywhere in the West these days.

Genuinely curious.-Very few Canadians can currently qualify for a mortgage for an average home in most markets. The housing market has lost all rational basis.-Canada has approximately 2 million apartment units across all of Canada [1]. The vacancy rate is currently at less than 1% across Canada, and in many areas is hovering around zero. Just as some context, the vacancy rate in California pushes above 5%. NYC is an especially tight market at 3.1%. In both cases the apartments per capita is dramatically higher than Canada.-Landlords of apartments that do come to market have become spectacularly picky, because they can be. Perfect credit. Perfect history. No debts. People have been in situations where they&#x27;ve offered tens of thousands in deposits and a seemingly perfect application, to be denied.It is fascinating how often data is shown that betrays that Canada is in a particularly terrible situation -- like this very submission -- yet people still retort with \"oh well it&#x27;s bad everywhere\". No, it is nothing like Canada.Canada is a fully saturated market like nowhere else on the planet. And this government is squeezing a hundred thousand more a month into an already full container, with zero indication of a letup.[1] - As some fun context relative to the 2 million apartments across the entire country, Canada currently has >900,000 international students in Canada, a number that is growing by leaps and bounds. reply Grimburger 15 hours agoparentprevAnd here&#x27;s me escaping the west along with my neighbors escaping China, none of us have had a rental price rise in 4 years.

However, Vakoc and team hypothesize that because RMS cells are \"highly sensitive\" to changes in PAX3-FOXO1 expression, there could be a \"window of opportunity\" in which a drug inhibits NF-Y long enough for RMS cells to differentiate but not so long that healthy tissues get damaged.Author buried the most important \"but..\" in the last paragraph.

So possible.I think basically all pathogens and many cancers have to have some way to delay, suppress or evade immunity or they get quickly dealt with.

As Hillis explains it, genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce. Understanding what&#x27;s going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens.”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;scITIoJvMJ0?si=boMyciGMFf6X6AQH reply bobmaxup 20 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1073&#x2F;pnas.2303859120 reply Zaskoda 18 hours agoparentI think this was meant for another post.

Are you saying that high doses of manganese will make it easier to build muscle? reply darkclouds 18 hours agorootparentNo I&#x27;m saying manganese helps regulates insulin which in turn helps modulate parts of the immune system. [1] It helps to smooth the blood sugar spike.Chromium reduces insulin sensitivity which is helpful for cells especially muscle which in turn increases stamina. There are plenty of studies which call into question the RDA&#x27;s for supplements and there are misleading studies like [3].For example, [2] (Zinc) deficiency during pregnancy causes irreversible effects on the newborn such as growth impairment, spontaneous abortion, congenital malformations and poor birth outcomes.The same probably exists for other supplements and likewise over exposure will also introduce problems like nickel over exposure can cause fibrotic lung in animal experiments which could explain why some people are born with cystic fibrosis.In this example [3], the subjects are only consuming 200micrograms of chromium. I&#x27;m not surprised they didnt see any effect, the RDA is 400ug, but some body builders have been known to take upto 2.4g aka 2,400mg aka 2,400,000ug and have seen effects (cant find the study now), but the weight training muddies the water so to speak. And the chromium intake assumes there is enough manganese in the diet to help produce enough insulin and thus smooth the blood sugar levels in the first place.Zinc plays a role at stabilising cell membranes, it can help reduce the need for a vit E intake which also helps protect cell membranes and is also heavily concentrated in organs like the pancreas.And whilst non digestive exposure to metals like zinc and manganese can cause problems, the digestive system is very capable at removing excess intakes via the bile acids, helping to reduce any risks.Zinc, manganese and chromium will all have an effect on the immune system, but as manganese is most commonly associated with insulin production, I only mentioned the manganese.This study [4] shows that chromium alters the immune response by immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive processes, by altering the insulin resistance of cells.We are very complex chemical reactions, so trying to get the right intake seems to be a logical first step and with todays technology, and the complete absence of medical experts asking about diet in the first place, how can they even do their job properly for long term illnesses?So in this reprogramming of cancer cells, yes its a another scientific achievement but is this another achievement once the horse has bolted and should we actually be looking more at the quality and nutrition of our food and environment in order to avoid reactionary medicine?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medicalnewstoday.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;322946#:~:text=%E2...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC9262205&#x2F;[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;9861607&#x2F;[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;femspd&#x2F;article&#x2F;34&#x2F;1&#x2F;1&#x2F;498748 reply moffkalast 19 hours agoprevTangentially relevant xkcd https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1217&#x2F; reply unixhero 18 hours agoprev [–] Ah CRISPR again reply jdjdjdjdjduuuu 16 hours agoparent [–] CRISPR IS the greatest invention since the internet replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
