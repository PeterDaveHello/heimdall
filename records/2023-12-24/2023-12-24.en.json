[Paper] Haoxuan You*, Haotian Zhang*, Zhe Gan, Xianzhi Du, Bowen Zhang, Zirui Wang, Liangliang Cao, Shih-Fu Chang, Yinfei Yang [*: equal contribution] Overview Diagram of Ferret Model. Key Contributions: Ferret Model - Hybrid Region Representation + Spatial-aware Visual Sampler enable fine-grained and open-vocabulary referring and grounding in MLLM. GRIT Dataset (~1.1M) - A Large-scale, Hierarchical, Robust ground-and-refer instruction tuning dataset. Ferret-Bench - A multimodal evaluation benchmark that jointly requires Referring/Grounding, Semantics, Knowledge, and Reasoning. Release [12/14] üî• We released the checkpoints(7B, 13B). [10/30] üî• We released the code of FERRET model and Ferret-Bench. Usage and License Notices: The data, and code is intended and licensed for research use only.

To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the per_device_train_batch_size and increase the gradient_accumulation_steps accordingly. Always keep the global batch size the same: per_device_train_batch_size x gradient_accumulation_steps x num_gpus.

Please download its weights following the instructions here. Vicuna v1.3 is used in FERRET. Then download LLaVA's first-stage pre-trained projector weight (7B, 13B). FERRET Training The scripts are provided (7B, 13B). Evaluation Please see this doc for the details. Checkpoints We extracted the delta between our pre-trained model and Vicuna. Please first download weights of Vicuna following the previous instruction. Then download our prepared offsets of weights: 7B, 13B using wget or curl, and unzip the downloaded offsets. Lastly, apply the offset to the Vicuna's weight by running the following script: # 7B python3 -m ferret.model.apply_delta \\ --base ./model/vicuna-7b-v1-3 \\ --target ./model/ferret-7b-v1-3 \\ --delta path/to/ferret-7b-delta # 13B python3 -m ferret.model.apply_delta \\ --base ./model/vicuna-13b-v1-3 \\ --target ./model/ferret-13b-v1-3 \\ --delta path/to/ferret-13b-delta Notices: Apple's rights in the attached weight differentials are hereby licensed under the CC-BY-NC license. Apple makes no representations with regards to LLaMa or any other third party software, which are subject to their own terms. Please refer to the next section about how to set up a local demo with pre-trained weight. Demo To run our demo, you need to train FERRET and use the checkpoints locally. Gradio web UI is used. Please run the following commands one by one. Launch a controller python -m ferret.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000 Launch a gradio web server. python -m ferret.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000 --model-list-mode reload --add_region_feature Launch a model worker This is the worker that load the ckpt and do the inference on the GPU. Each worker is responsible for a single model specified in --model-path. CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m ferret.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path ./checkpoints/FERRET-13B-v0 --add_region_feature Wait until the process finishes loading the model and you see \"Uvicorn running on ...\". Now, refresh your Gradio web UI, and you will see the model you just launched in the model list. Example of Ferret Interactive Demo.

Holy crap, if google can&#x27;t deliver in the accessibility space for this (image descriptions better than \"the logo for the company\"), then I&#x27;ll definitely go back to Apple. I mean I do hope Apple cleans out bugs and makes VoiceOver feel like it won&#x27;t fall over if I breathed hard, but their image descriptions, even without an LLM, are already clean and clear. More like \"A green logo on a black background\", where Google is, like I said, more like \"The logo for the company.\" I guess it&#x27;s kinda what we get when AI is crowdsourced rather than given good, high quality data to work with. reply sagz 4 hours agoparentGoogle&#x27;s Lookout app (accessibility for the blind and visually impaired) was updated ~6 months ago with a multimodal LLM already.It uses the Flamingo model family: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepmind.google&#x2F;discover&#x2F;blog&#x2F;tackling-multiple-task... reply zitterbewegung 14 hours agoparentprevHonestly if they are coming out with a paper now Apple has probably been working on it for a year or two at minimum . Next year releases of macOS &#x2F; iOS are rumored to have LLMs as a feature . reply beoberha 13 hours agorootparentI don‚Äôt mean to discount this work, but this particular model is the product of a few months of work tops. It‚Äôs effectively LLava with different training data, targeted at a specific use case. While I‚Äôm sure there is a significant effort at multimodal LLMs within Apple, this is just a tiny corner of it. reply ex3ndr 7 hours agorootparentprevThey literally mention that they built on top of llava that was released half year ago. reply smolder 3 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s the \"literally\" here? Try: They mention that they built on top of llava, which was released half a year ago. reply superb_dev 3 hours agorootparentIn this context ‚Äúliterally‚Äù is being used to draw attention to the perceived obviousness of the information. Essentially saying ‚Äúhow could you not see this?‚Äù reply refulgentis 11 hours agorootparentprev> Honestly if they are coming out with a paper now Apple has probably been working on it for a year or two at minimumWhy do you say that? reply amitprasad 12 hours agoprevAlso relevant: LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited MemoryApple seems to be gearing up for significant advances in on-device inference using this LLMshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2312.11514 reply adt 14 hours agoprevOld paper (Oct&#x2F;2023), but the weights are new (Dec&#x2F;2023):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lifearchitect.ai&#x2F;models-table&#x2F; reply rreichman 6 hours agoparentOct 23 is old :) reply a_rahmanshah 25 minutes agoprevCan we run this on macOS? reply shrimpx 13 hours agoprevApple has been looking sleepy on LLMs, but they&#x27;ve been consistently evolving their hardware+software AI stack, without much glitzy advertising. I think they could blow away Microsoft&#x2F;OpenAI and Google, if suddenly a new iOS release makes the OpenAI&#x2F;Bard chatbox look laughably antiquated. They&#x27;re also a threat to Nvidia, if a significant swath of AI usage switches over to Apple hardware. Arm and TSMC would stand to win. reply madeofpalk 12 hours agoparentI doubt Apple‚Äôs going to make some big ChatGPT-style chatbot. They‚Äôre ‚Äújust‚Äù going to use the same tech to drive iterative (good!) improvements to their products, like Siri and keyboard auto-complete. reply shrimpx 12 hours agorootparentYeah. Siri supports text input already, anyway. Siri is their ChatGPT-style bot that&#x27;s going to keep improving. reply fbdab103 12 hours agorootparentprevI would challenge the keyboard autocomplete. I find the Apple suggestions to be frustratingly poor vs my experience on Android. reply spike021 9 hours agorootparentI thought it couldn&#x27;t get any worse and then I upgraded to iOS 17. It&#x27;s awful. reply Booourns 12 hours agorootparentprevOut of curiosity have you experienced their autocorrect on iOS 17 because that‚Äôs when they updated to be LLM based? reply FLT8 7 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t recall exactly when it started happening, but I&#x27;ve been having lots of issues with recent iOS versions rewriting not the last word entered, but the word before that. For example, if I start entering \"I went to\", it&#x27;ll sometimes correct to \"I want to\", but it&#x27;ll do that after I&#x27;ve typed the \"to\". I&#x27;ve found lots of similar examples. The retrospective nature of the edits mean I miss a lot of them and makes me appear a lot less literate than I am. reply walteweiss 2 hours agorootparentSame happens to me quite very often on a mobile, even here. But I use iPhone SE 1st Gen. with iOS 15.8. reply georgespencer 12 hours agorootparentprevTransformer based autocomplete on iOS 17 feels just as bad -- but in different ways -- as its previous incarnation to me. reply simonair 12 hours agorootparentAre you tapping the keys or swiping over those that make up the word you want to type? In my experience, tapping has always been and remained poor but swiping is getting better and better with every iOS version. reply LoganDark 10 hours agorootparentSwiping through keys doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with autocomplete. Autocomplete has to do with predicting which word you&#x27;re going to type next, not guessing which word best corresponds to the swipe you just made. replydwaite 4 hours agoparentprev> Apple has been looking sleepy on LLMs, but they&#x27;ve been consistently evolving their hardware+software AI stack, without much glitzy advertisingThey don&#x27;t sell compute time to other companies to run AI, or massive custom hardware for AI training.They aren&#x27;t after VC funding.Their core business isn&#x27;t threatened by AI being \"the evolution of search\"Product-wise, so far all you hear is messaging around things like pointing out the applicability of the M3 Max for running ML models.Until they have real consumer products ready, they only need to keep tabs on analysts, with lip service at financial meetings. reply harryVic 13 hours agoparentprevCan you give an example? I switched to android because i use personal assistant a lot while driving and siri was absolutely horrible. reply shrimpx 12 hours agorootparent- FaceID- Facial recognition in Photos- \"Memories\" in Photos- iOS keyboard autocomplete using LLMs. I am bilingual and noticed in the latest iOS it now does multi-language autocomplete and you no longer have to manually switch languages.- Event detection for Calendar- Depth Fusion in the iOS camera app, using ML to take crisper photos- Probably others...The crazy thing is most&#x2F;all of these run on the device. reply pants2 10 hours agorootparentThe iPhone&#x27;s built in text OCR and image subject cutouts are also extremely good, just in the photos app. reply shrimpx 10 hours agorootparentYeah totally, I copy text from images all the time. reply pkage 12 hours agorootparentprevI just wish you could turn the multilingual keyboard off‚ÄîI find that I usually only type in one language at a time and having the autocomplete recommend the wrong languages is quite frustrating reply shrimpx 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true, I have found that mildly annoying sometimes. But most of the time it&#x27;s a win. It was really annoying manually switching modes over and over when typing in mixed-language, which I do fairly often. It&#x27;d be great if there was a setting though. reply cezart 2 hours agorootparentI had the opposite problem, the languages I usually typed in(Romanian + English) didn&#x27;t have a multi language mode on iOS. So it was a constant pain to switch btw them when I needed to insert some English terms in Romanian sentences. IOS didn&#x27;t support multi language for this language pair. On Android it always worked like a charm. reply hansoolo 11 hours agorootparentprevTo be honest I distrust Microsoft with swift key, but the it recognizes the change in language just smooth. I could switch languages in one sentence and it would understand what I am writing just fine, no Sill suggestions reply Aerbil313 6 hours agorootparentApple recommending wrong words when you write in mixed-language was the case in iOS 15, so much I always needed to manually change my keyboard language. But it‚Äôs no more in iOS 17. As an example I just typed this entire comment in Turkish keyboard with English autocorrect and suggestions working.Maybe the (most likely) AI-based thing requires some training though. I got my new iPhone a month or so ago. reply theferalrobot 12 hours agoparentprevGiven Apple&#x27;s track record on anything AI related and the terrible state they keep CoreML that not only seems extraordinarily unlikely, it would take a lot of time to win developer trust and that I just don&#x27;t see happening. reply hosh 12 hours agorootparentApple doesn‚Äôt have to win developer trust or build an AI platform. They just have to build a compelling consumer product that can only function with AI, and they are better equipped to do that than Google or Microsoft. It remains to be seen if OpenAI will go that route instead of a business built on training and providing access to foundational models. reply theferalrobot 10 hours agorootparent>They just have to build a compelling consumer product that can only function with AIYeah and I&#x27;m not talking exclusively about developer trust. Given Apple&#x27;s current consumer lineup (see Siri, Apple photos, predictive text etc)... we only have evidence that they suck at ML. What makes you think they are going to suddenly transform overnight? reply Aerbil313 5 hours agorootparent> see Siri, Apple photos, predictive text etc)... we only have evidence that they suck at ML‚Ä¶or that they only deal with mature tech and not the shiny new thing. Makes sense to me. I don‚Äôt doubt everyone will have a personal LLM-based assistant in their phones soon, but with the current rate of improvements to LLMs and AI in general, I‚Äôd wait for at least a year more while doing R&D in-house if I were Apple. reply theferalrobot 2 hours agorootparentYou could use that apologist language for any company. If they suck at something just say they are ‚Äúbiding their time‚Äù No. Apple is just demonstrably behind.Having terrible predictive text, voice to text, image classification etc isn‚Äôt just a quark of the way they do business. Those are problems with years of established work put into them and they just flat out aren‚Äôt keeping up. reply agentcoops 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, this is the most important point and I think somehow least present in even discussions here: the technical question of who produces the best&#x2F;cheapest LLM&#x2F;future architecture is considerably less important than who, if anyone, creates a fundamentally new and dominant consumer experience built on AI. Most of the existing players (Google, Meta) would of course prefer that nobody produces such a newly dominant paradigm of computation for end-users since it would greatly reduce their relevance and subsequently revenues. Right now, ChatGPT is the only real contender in this space. However, I think you‚Äôre correct that it‚Äôs actually Apple who is most likely to be the next who attempts such a paradigm shift. Far too early to bet, but let‚Äôs say I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if in five years we end up in a world in which Apple has the consumer monopoly and Microsoft the business monopoly, with Google and Meta falling into irrelevance. reply mark_l_watson 12 hours agorootparentprevI have enjoyed working with CoreML over the last few years. Please share what you didn‚Äôt like about it. reply theferalrobot 10 hours agorootparentThere are so many modern ML components that have terrible or no support in CoreML. Try to do any convolution other than conv2d, advanced or custom activation functions etc and you are out of luck. Exporting from PyTorch leads to all sorts of headaches with subtle behavior changes between implementations it is definitely a pain point for developers of widely used software reply mark_l_watson 9 hours agorootparent+1 thanks reply Affric 13 hours agoparentprevDon‚Äôt TSMC make Nvidia‚Äôs chips too? reply shrimpx 12 hours agorootparentYup! TSMC wins either way. reply aaronbrethorst 17 hours agoprevCan someone define the term ‚ÄúMLLM‚Äù? reply schaefer 17 hours agoparentMultimodal Large Language Model reply pests 17 hours agorootparentwhy not LLMM? reply CharlesW 17 hours agorootparentBecause the first word is \"multimodal\" :^) and also because MLLM is the established initialism. reply pests 16 hours agorootparentMy point was the phrase already contains the word model. Why are we calling it a multimodel LL model? Why not just add multi to the existing model? reply notdisliked 16 hours agorootparentMultimodal, not multimodel. Multimodal referring to the different possible modes of input (text, picture) into the model. reply sva_ 16 hours agorootparentprevModal, not model reply chaos_emergent 16 hours agorootparentprevMultimodAl, not multimodEl reply astrange 13 hours agorootparentprevThere is something like a \"multimodel LLM\" but it&#x27;s called MoE (\"mixture of experts\"). reply TrueDuality 16 hours agorootparentprevModalities and models are not the same thing. reply replygirl 17 hours agorootparentprevwhat&#x27;s a language multimodal model reply bbor 17 hours agorootparentprevOk our options Multimodal large language model Large multimodal language model Large language multimodal model Large language model (multimodal)I prefer 1, because this is a multimodal type of an existing technique already referred to as LLM. If I was king, I‚Äôd do Omnimodal Linguistic Minds, but no one asks me such things, thank god reply dilippkumar 5 hours agorootparentSome of the modalities in multimodal are non-linguistic. For example, image or video input. In those cases, is it still a language model? reply n2d4 15 hours agorootparentprevI mean, if we want to be silly, what about \"Language model (large, multimodal\"? :) reply rain_iwakura 13 hours agorootparentprevThe bikeshed color argument never ceases to be relevant. Would you say \"large language model multimodal\"? I doubt it. reply Tempest1981 16 hours agoparentprevAlso, is FERRET an acronym? reply Someone 13 hours agorootparentI would guess it‚Äôs wordplay on other models being named after animals (llama, vicu√±a) and figurative use of ‚Äúferret‚Äù.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wiktionary.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ferret: ‚Äú3.

Their hardware is well-positioned for it.It could make me get a new phone outside of my usual ~4 year cycle. Siri is almost unusable for me. reply aaronbrethorst 17 hours agoparentRumors suggest they‚Äôre gearing up to make iOS 18 an AI focused release. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if they offer different capabilities for online&#x2F;offline scenarios, or if their offerings are strictly offline.Here‚Äôs one story to offer some context. There are others. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.is&#x2F;en3VL reply behnamoh 16 hours agorootparent> Rumors suggest they‚Äôre gearing up to make iOS 18 an AI focused release.Don&#x27;t underestimate Apple at disappointing enthusiasts like you and me.

They sit there in silence with a few leaks here and there and some github projects, people speculate and get all excited about extrapolating those things. Then Apple deliver what works which may or may not be related to it.What they don&#x27;t do is sell you a lie a year before release then deliver shit (like every other fucking vendor). reply zdragnar 16 hours agorootparentThey&#x27;re plenty capable of delivering garbage. Certain year models of the MacBook pro were inherently faulty. I&#x27;ve had the displeasure of having two of them bought for me at work.All of Apple&#x27;s windows software (iTunes, Safari, etc) has been, at best, a barely working port.I&#x27;m assuming they are putting a lot more thought and care into it than the touchbar, crappy keyboards and the rest, but I&#x27;m also not holding out much hope either. reply MBCook 14 hours agorootparentApple can screw up, no question. But they don‚Äôt do the two-year hype cycle thing that just about everyone else does in technology (or video games).It‚Äôs incredibly rare for Apple to publicly talk about things that won‚Äôt be selling extremely soon.The iPhone had to be pronounced because it was going to show up on the FCC website, and obviously Apple wanted to control the message. I suspect the Vision Pro may be similar, but they also wanted developers to start getting ready so they would have software day one.The only thing I can think of that Apple pre-announced and failed at was the Air Power mat. They said it would be coming out soon after and had to push that a couple times before finally canceling it.Other than that small exception, if modern (post jobs return) Apple announces something is coming, it will come out and be quite close to what they say.They don‚Äôt pull a Humane AI, Segway, Cyberpunk 2077, or No Man‚Äôs Sky. reply pjerem 15 hours agorootparentprevHello MacBook Pro 2016 ! reply scarface_74 14 hours agorootparentAnd that Apple &#x2F;&#x2F;&#x2F; that Apple released in 1980 was also garbage‚Ä¶ reply baz00 16 hours agorootparentprevSince they got rid of Jony, it&#x27;s been great. That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. reply mpweiher 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely!The hardware, that is.With software, their Come to Jesus moment is still in the future.(To me, Swift is sort of the Jony correlate on the software side. Doesn&#x27;t fit perfectly, of course, but very similar \"we are perfect who cares about evidence la la la I can&#x27;t hear you\" vibes and results) reply behnamoh 12 hours agorootparentYes, they have treated macOS like a toy. It&#x27;s time they made it a real OS. reply baz00 2 hours agorootparentI despise this perspective. It‚Äôs pretty much finished. What more crap do you want shovelled onto it? replybehnamoh 13 hours agorootparentprev> What they don&#x27;t do is sell you a lie a year before release then deliver shit (like every other fucking vendor).If you&#x27;re referring to Google, then you&#x27;re right. But OpenAI has consistently delivered what they announced pretty quickly. Same with Microsoft. To think that Apple somehow has a secret sauce that helps them surprise everyone is an illusion. They&#x27;ve had 3 years now to show their interest in LLMs, but they&#x27;re just too conservative to \"think different\" anymore. reply cpill 12 hours agorootparentI think LLMs are to inconsistent for Apple&#x27;s taste, I mean that in both senses. Their perfectionism won&#x27;t risk bad output, ever, which is impossible for LLMs reply baz00 2 hours agorootparentprevNowhere near that. They‚Äôre a totally unproven tool with a lot of bad side effects. They just don‚Äôt want to go to market with that.I mean they do truly useful stuff already using ML just not LLMs reply ignoramous 13 hours agorootparentprev> marketing team chose to keep it for future iOS&#x2F;MBP&#x2F;iPhone generations to keep the profits high.VisionPro is nice. I can see costs coming down over a period of time. Also, we&#x27;ve been waiting long enough for that AI car. reply yreg 2 hours agorootparentApple has never promised any car. From what is known, project Titan has been cancelled years ago.The only exeption of not delivering I can recall was AirPower. It&#x27;s a product they&#x27;ve announced and then embarassingly weren&#x27;t able to finish up to their standards (or up to what was promised), so they have cancelled it altogether. reply darthrupert 15 hours agorootparentprevMy expectation of Apple is that they lurk in the shadows, looking at what others do while perfecting their own thing. Then on the day of release, they&#x27;ll be a decade ahead of competition.They&#x27;ve done this a dozen times already. reply antiframe 14 hours agorootparentWhich dozen times has Apple released something decades ahead of the competition?

In the current state it‚Äôs only good for fixed phrases. And even then it fails time to time reply fodkodrasz 2 hours agorootparentFor me fixed phrases would do it often, I use Siri mostly when driving, but keeps saying for almost any command&#x2F;query: Sorry I can&#x27;t do that while you are driving. (other main usecase is setting tea&#x2F;cooking timers with hands full&#x2F;greasy. This alone makes it pretty useful.)I guess this won&#x27;t change, because it is probably for legal reasons, to avoid being sued by some \"I just dried my cat in the microwave\" style genius after making a car accident (unrelated to Siri, but trying to shift the blame).Adding support for smaller languages would be nice actually. When its reading out of Hungarian messages loud it sounds incredibly retarded. I always have a great time listening to those and trying to guess the message. :) It would be nice if I could send a message to my significant other about being stuck in traffic in Hungarian. (the iPhone keyboard already does pretty decent voice recognition in the language) reply behnamoh 16 hours agorootparentprevI hope they get rid of it completely. People on r&#x2F;locallama and others have made much better assistants using GPT which use iOS APIs to control the phone.

To unify referring and grounding in the LLM paradigm, Ferret employs a novel and powerful hybrid region representation that integrates discrete coordinates and continuous features jointly to represent a region in the image. To extract the continuous features of versatile regions, we propose a spatial-aware visual sampler, adept at handling varying sparsity across different shapes. Consequently, Ferret can accept diverse region inputs, such as points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes. To bolster the desired capability of Ferret, we curate GRIT, a comprehensive refer-and-ground instruction tuning dataset including 1.1M samples that contain rich hierarchical spatial knowledge, with 95K hard negative data to promote model robustness. The resulting model not only achieves superior performance in classical referring and grounding tasks, but also greatly outperforms existing MLLMs in region-based and localization-demanded multimodal chatting. Our evaluations also reveal a significantly improved capability of describing image details and a remarkable alleviation in object hallucination.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2310.07704 reply devinprater 15 hours agoparentThis is going to be great for accessibility!

    "originBody": "Protesters at Meta's headquarters demand the company stop removing pro-Palestine content on 12 December. Photograph: Calvin Stewart/Zuma Press Wire/Shutterstock Meta Meta censors pro-Palestinian views on a global scale, report claims Rights group says Facebook and Instagram routinely engage in ‚Äòsix key patterns of undue censorship‚Äô of content supporting Palestine Richard Luscombe @richlusc Thu 21 Dec 2023 11.58 EST Meta has engaged in a ‚Äúsystemic and global‚Äù censorship of pro-Palestinian content since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war on 7 October, according to a new report from Human Rights Watch (HRW). Meta wrong to remove graphic Israel-Gaza videos, oversight board says Read more In a scathing 51-page report, the organization documented and reviewed more than a thousand reported instances of Meta removing content and suspending or permanently banning accounts on Facebook and Instagram. The company exhibited ‚Äúsix key patterns of undue censorship‚Äù of content in support of Palestine and Palestinians, including the taking down of posts, stories and comments; disabling accounts; restricting users‚Äô ability to interact with others‚Äô posts; and ‚Äúshadow banning‚Äù, where the visibility and reach of a person‚Äôs material is significantly reduced, according to HRW. Examples it cites include content originating from more than 60 countries, mostly in English, and all in ‚Äúpeaceful support of Palestine, expressed in diverse ways‚Äù. Even HRW‚Äôs own posts seeking examples of online censorship were flagged as spam, the report said. ‚ÄúCensorship of content related to Palestine on Instagram and Facebook is systemic and global [and] Meta‚Äôs inconsistent enforcement of its own policies led to the erroneous removal of content about Palestine,‚Äù the group said in the report, citing ‚Äúerroneous implementation, overreliance on automated tools to moderate content, and undue government influence over content removals‚Äù as the roots of the problem. In a statement to the Guardian, Meta acknowledged it makes errors that are ‚Äúfrustrating‚Äù for people, but said that ‚Äúthe implication that we deliberately and systemically suppress a particular voice is false. Claiming that 1,000 examples, out of the enormous amount of content posted about the conflict, are proof of ‚Äòsystemic censorship‚Äô may make for a good headline, but that doesn‚Äôt make the claim any less misleading. Meta said it was the only company in the world to have publicly released human rights due diligence on issues related to Israel and Palestine . ‚ÄúThis report ignores the realities of enforcing our policies globally during a fast-moving, highly polarized and intense conflict, which has led to an increase in content being reported to us. Our policies are designed to give everyone a voice while at the same time keeping our platforms safe,‚Äù the company‚Äôs statement reads. It is the second time this month that Meta has been challenged over accusations that it routinely silences pro-Palestinian content and voices. Last week Elizabeth Warren, Democratic senator for Massachusetts, wrote to Meta‚Äôs co-founder and chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, demanding information following hundreds of reports from Instagram users dating back to October that their content was demoted or removed, and their accounts subjected to shadow banning. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to TechScape Free weekly newsletter Alex Hern's weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The board said the videos were valuable for ‚Äúinforming the world about human suffering on both sides‚Äù. One showed the aftermath of an airstrike near al-Shifa hospital in Gaza via Instagram, the other a woman being taken hostage during the 7 October attack via Facebook. The clips were reinstated. Users of Meta‚Äôs products have documented what they say is technological bias in favor of pro-Israel content and against pro-Palestinian posts. Instagram‚Äôs translation software replaced ‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù followed by the Arabic phrase ‚ÄúPraise be to Allah‚Äù to ‚ÄúPalestinian terrorists‚Äù in English.

In other cases the content praised attacks by Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the US government.From HRWs descriptions it sounds like the bulk of the \"1049\" content removals were clear violations of Meta&#x27;s policies against support for violence.Regardless of whether you agree, these don&#x27;t seem surprising to me on light of Meta&#x27;s own rules. There are of course a small number of exceptions listed. reply abeppu 8 hours agoparentLooking at the actual report, I really disagree with your assessment. It sounds like there&#x27;s a bunch of nonsense in there where Meta is _not_ living up to its own policies, and is flagging stuff disingenuously.> Human Rights Watch also found repeated inaccurate application of the ‚Äúadult nudity and sexual activity‚Äù policy for content related to Palestine. In every one of the cases, we reviewed where this policy was invoked, the content included images of dead Palestinians over ruins in Gaza that were clothed, not naked. For example, multiple users reported their Instagram stories being removed under this policy when they posted the same image of a Palestinian father in Gaza who was killed while he was holding his clothed daughter, who was also killed.... so no nudity, no sexual activity> For example, a Facebook user post that said, ‚ÄúHow can anyone justify supporting the killing of babies and innocent civilians‚Ä¶‚Äù was removed under Community Standards on ‚Äúbullying and harassment.‚Äù Another user posted an image on Instagram of a dead child in a hospital in Gaza with the comment, ‚ÄúIsrael bombs the Baptist Hospital in Gaza City killing over 500‚Ä¶‚Äù which was removed under Community Guidelines on ‚Äúviolence and incitement.‚Äù... arguing _against_ violence is flagged as harassment. Image and statement about Israeli action flagged as incitement> In one case, an Instagram user received a warning that the comment she posted ‚Äúmay be hurtful to others.‚Äù The comment, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, consisted of nothing more than a series of Palestinian flag emojis.[77] In other cases, Meta hid the Palestinian flag from comment sections or removed it on the basis that it ‚Äúharasses, targets, or shames others.‚Äù[78]...that&#x27;s just kinda indefensible.> Many users reported posts on Instagram being removed when they criticized the Israeli government, including the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no matter how nuanced or careful their posts were. Meta removed these posts under its ‚ÄúDangerous Organizations or Individuals‚Äù and hate speech rules, respectively.... which is crazy since there have been plenty of reasons to criticize Netanyahu well before the Oct 7 attacks.On the topic of \"From the river to the sea\", they specifically mention that posts with this phrase, as well as others> such as ‚ÄúFree Palestine,‚Äù ‚ÄúCeasefire Now,‚Äù and ‚ÄúStop the Genocide,‚Äù were repeatedly removed by Instagram and Facebook under ‚Äúspam‚Äù Community Guidelines or Standards without appearing to take into account the context of these comments.I.e. Meta&#x27;s own cited policy was not that it \"is considered hateful\" as you say, but that this political expression was labeled as spam. That sounds pretty bogus.As for the \"is considered hateful by many\", that&#x27;s true, but is also subjective, and very tangled given that prominent Israeli conservatives have used very similar phrasing. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;From_the_river_to_the_sea#Simi...If someone actually praising the Oct 7 attacks or something gets flagged&#x2F;banned&#x2F;etc, then sure, Meta is just applying its policies. That does not seem to be what&#x27;s happening here. It&#x27;s true that the report doesn&#x27;t give numbers for these specific treatments, and the authors have a limited and biased view based on who responded to their call for evidence. But the limited view doesn&#x27;t seem to be of Meta even-handedly and competently applying their policies._However_, I don&#x27;t want to attribute everything to malice where incompetence may be at least a partial explanation. If motivated 3rd parties are repeatedly flagging a photo of a clothed, dead Palestinian as \"nudity\", and Meta&#x27;s systems are built with the assumption that such user-provided flags are presumed trustworthy, then we could easily see how someone posting that photo would get incorrectly&#x2F;inappropriately flagged. reply reissbaker 4 hours agorootparentI think without actual access to the material it&#x27;s pretty hard to say. For example, the report highlights that someone commented with nothing but a series of Palestinian flags to someone&#x27;s post, and their comment was flagged and removed. However, they don&#x27;t share what the original post was; responding with a series of Palestinian flags to an Israeli hostage relative&#x27;s post about their kidnapped sibling, for example, would be clear harassment and abuse. (And these kinds of abusive comments are extremely common.)The report also has some pretty strange language, like mentioning that a post which was flagged for nudity contained a picture of a dead woman, and a fully-clothed man holding her body. But... There are so, so many pictures of fully-clothed, male members of Hamas holding nude or partially-nude dead women they abducted and&#x2F;or raped before murdering. Why does the report only say that the man was fully clothed? Maybe it&#x27;s just a grammatical error, but they&#x27;re really light on the details, and releasing the underlying data would answer a lot of questions.Personally I am suspicious of HRW&#x27;s report, since they&#x27;ve been caught releasing misleading reports in the past, and the director of HRW&#x27;s Israel&#x2F;Palestine division is a BDS activist [1]. Obviously your viewpoint may be different, but without access to the underlying information it&#x27;s pretty hard to make a compelling case to either side... Which to me points to the report being more worthy of suspicion, since if it was clear-cut, they&#x27;d easily convince more people of their correctness by releasing the data.1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ngo-monitor.org&#x2F;fact-sheet-on-omar-shakirs-bds-c... reply selcuka 3 hours agorootparentThis is a bit too much of reading between the lines, suspiciously so.> Why does the report only say that the man was fully clothed?It does not. This is misrepresenting what is written in the report, to say the least. There are two such examples in the report (not sure if they refer to the same image): The first one is \"image of a Palestinian father in Gaza who was killed while he was holding his clothed daughter, who was also killed\" and the other one is \"an image of a fully clothed man holding a girl, both deceased\". Obviously in both pictures both man and the woman are dead, debunking your \"male members of Hamas holding nude or partially-nude dead women\" theory.> However, they don&#x27;t share what the original post was; responding with a series of Palestinian flags to an Israeli hostage relative&#x27;s post about their kidnapped sibling, for example, would be clear harassment and abuse.Again, this is just a guess and not factual information. In fact, the report has a link to the original source in footnote 78 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;28&#x2F;instagram-palestinian-fl...) and one of the comments Instagram has hidden was on a pro-Palestinian post:> In one, a user commented on an Instagram video of a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Jordan with green, white, and black heart emojis corresponding to the colors of the Palestinian flag, along with emojis of the Moroccan and Palestinian flags.Also:> The Intercept reviewed several hidden comments containing the Palestinian flag emoji that had no reference to Hamas or any other banned group. reply dang 3 hours agorootparentPlease make your substantive points without swipes such as \"Again, you are making up things\".

Another screenshot seen by The Intercept showed two hidden comments consisting only of the hashtags #Gaza, #gazaunderattack, #freepalestine, and #ceasefirenow.The Intercept does not provide the context on the posts that the flag comments were on, or the hashtags ‚Äî and visibly-Jewish people across social media have been barraged since Oct. 7th by strangers brigading their completely-unrelated posts with comments like this, and are targeted for harassment just for being Jewish; I think being suspicious of the context is fairly natural. And please refrain from personal attacks.Re: the man holding the girl ‚Äî yes, I am referring to the one in which both are deceased, but only the man is referenced as being fully-clothed; members of Hamas can be deceased too. Maybe the girl is also fully-clothed, but not releasing any of the data doesn&#x27;t help build confidence. reply bjourne 3 hours agorootparentprevNGO Monitor is itself not a credible source.

In almost every case people call \"shadow ban\", the cause was occasionally an actual bug (code doing something undesired and unexpected) or far more often people posting bad content.The ML is good enough to know whether your followers want to engage with political content.

The cars closer are mostly damaged by fire, and only the closest few have blast damage. The solar panels on the roof of the 2 story building next to the parking lot are undamaged (just look at that \"house of card\" installation of the panels - them still where means no blast wave reached them). There is no way for that explosion to damage the hospital building, and not surprisingly there aren&#x27;t photos of such a damage. That explosion couldn&#x27;t kill people beyond the distance of about 30ft. I.e. only people near those damaged cars could have been killed. Even if there was a crowd, such weak explosion doesn&#x27;t kill beyond the first couple rows of people. So, we&#x27;re talking at worst 10-20 people, if those for some reason crowded right near those damaged cars (in the middle of the night, why?).Now, where did the warhead came from? The explosion, judging by night video of it and the described damage on the photos, does look like a rocket of Grad class, definitely not larger. Israel doesn&#x27;t use such weak warheads in its stand-off weapons. Whereis Hamas does use thousands of such rockets. And these rockets, mostly built by Hamas in underground shops, have high rate of failure, i.e. Gaza is regularly showered with tens of malfunctioning Hamas rockets.

Hamas doesn&#x27;t have that power, militarily - only gross incompetence from the IDF allows that kind of attack.On the other hand, Israel is not facing good geopolitical headwinds. As Yemen demonstrated, they are extremely vulnerable to a blockade. One day, in the not so distant future, the US won&#x27;t be able to intercept all the missiles of Israel&#x27;s enemies on its behalf, and Israel will have to contend with the threat of a total blockade.So Israel desperately needs to make amends with its Arab neighbors, and it can stop any real attack from Hamas. That makes the situation pretty different and assymetrical.It also bears note that, if you judge Gaza as a country, it would not be able to cause any act of agression, as the Israeli blockade alone constitutes an act of war and a casus belli. That of course doesn&#x27;t justify Hamas&#x27;s inhuman war crimes, but acting as if war is unprovoked is not consistent with reality - Israel has never, by the definitions in international law, stopped actively waging war against Gaza. reply dlubarov 10 hours agorootparentI agree Israel ought to be able to prevent similar ground invasions, but what about rockets?The Iron Dome has been relatively effective so far, but the technological gap won&#x27;t last forever. Hamas has already acquired rockets like the Fajr-5, despite the blockade. Once they start using guidance systems, the destruction will be much greater, and 90% interception rate won&#x27;t be good enough.Even if Israel could limit the damage in the long term, it doesn&#x27;t seem politically viable to just tolerate repeated attacks with no response. So I think it&#x27;s inevitable that Israel will have to remove Hamas from power, no matter the geopolitical cost. reply sudosysgen 9 hours agorootparentHow would guidance systems increase the destruction? If anything, history has shown that precision weapons tend to reduce civilian casualties - there isn&#x27;t much of a point building a single precision guided missile, instead of 100 imprecise dumb rockets, when your goal is terror bombing (the calculus is slightly different for bombs, however).> Even if Israel could limit the damage in the long term, it doesn&#x27;t seem politically viable to just tolerate repeated attacks with no response. So I think it&#x27;s inevitable that Israel will have to remove Hamas from power, no matter the geopolitical cost.This is an odd gripe. Israel is perpetrating repeated attacks in the West Bank, every single day, and the Palestinian Authority as well as the vast majority of Palestinians in the West Bank have been tolerating repeated attacks for decades now. In fact, it is perfectly possible to tolerate repeated attacks with limited response, and there are many examples of countries tolerating low-impact attacks for a very long time with little response.Preventing Hamas or a Hamas-like group from existing is not possible as a matter of reality, not as a matter of geopolitical cost. Israel already tried the whole occupation thing, and it only meant more attacks. The only way to remove Hamas from power, without them being replaced by not-Hamas-in-name-only, is to convince Gazans, for a second time, that peaceful coexistence is possible, and to actually give it a shot this time. reply dlubarov 6 hours agorootparent> precision weapons tend to reduce civilian casualtiesYes, but normally the user is targeting military assets and trying to minimize collateral damage. I think it&#x27;s clear that Hamas has the opposite goal, since they typically lob unguided rockets in the general direction of population centers. reply anigbrowl 6 hours agorootparentIf all you have are unguided rockets, you&#x27;re going to point them wherever they&#x27;re most likely to hit something.

That&#x27;s how it goes in asymmetric warfare. reply dlubarov 4 hours agorootparentGiven Hamas&#x27; explicit genocidal goals, I think we can expect some portion of their strikes will simply aim to maximize Jewish deaths, even as others may target specific military assets.See for example Russia&#x27;s recent Hroza strike (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hroza_missile_attack), which killed 59 at a memorial service. Hamas can&#x27;t really do strikes like that today; they would just miss with overwhelming probability.

Compare the number of deaths it causes to the number of deaths a single unguided Israeli bomb causes in Gaza when it hits a populated building, and you will soon realize that the guidance is not the determining factor here, it&#x27;s just the mass of explosives. reply cuteboy19 2 hours agorootparentprev>high value targetsSuch as places with a lot of civilians yes reply sudosysgen 5 hours agorootparentprevThat makes no sense. If all you had were unguided rockets, where else could you possibly aim them? There is no other target where they would have any effect at all, because all high value targets are too small to be hit a +&#x2F;- 500m weapon.If your goal was just to hit a population center, I fail to understand the point of guided rockets. Seems much more effective to just make more dumb rockets. Even compared to targets like hospitals, you&#x27;d still do more damage with more dumb rockets, especially due to saturation. reply dlubarov 3 hours agorootparentI disagree that dumb rockets are more effective. Hamas, PIJ, etc. have only managed to kill 28 after launching something like 20k dumb rockets. There are many examples of modern precision weapons causing more deaths with a single strike. reply sudosysgen 1 hour agorootparentThat is mostly because the rockets are small and largely intercepted. The examples you have of modern weapons causing mass casualty events are of weapons with warheads 50+ times the size of those in a Hamas rocket, and there&#x27;s plenty of examples of comparable unguided weapons causing similar casualties numbers when fired at cities.Also, you need compare the deaths with the number of rockets that aren&#x27;t intercepted to get a baseline of effect. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentprev> the vast majority of Palestinians in the West Bank have been tolerating repeated attacks for decades nowI‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs more an inability to respond in any effective way. reply sudosysgen 7 hours agorootparentHamas doesn&#x27;t have an ability to respond in an effective way either, yet here we are.

What elevates an ordinary comment to a \"community note\" and what determines whether a \"community note\" stays up as a sort of verdict on the original post? This seems like a hard thing to get right at scale. If you rely on voting (i.e. likes or whatever), you&#x27;ll just end up with a parallel comment system, no more authoritative than the original one. So there must be some other process deciding which proposed notes get this special status.(Perhaps I should add: yes, I&#x27;m being lazy; no, I&#x27;m not being critical - I just want someone to explain this to me so I don&#x27;t have to work to find out.) reply sampo 23 minutes agorootparentBe a verified (by phone number, no need to pay) twitter user. Apply to be a Community notes contributor. Wait. If accepted, you start with 0 points. Twitter will start to show you proposed (as opposed to published) community notes. You can vote yes &#x2F; no. If a note you voted yes (or no) will get enough other yes (no) votes to get published (rejected), you will get 1 point. If you voted \"wrong\", you will lose a point. After you have a certain number of points (I think 5), you can also write proposed notes yourself, not just vote. If your note gets rejected, you lose 5 points.But twitter is not only counting the yes &#x2F; no votes. They need people who have voted differently on some previous notes, to agree in their votes on this note, before their algorithm makes the decision to publish or reject the note.A lot of proposed notes will never get enough votes to be decidedly published or rejected, so they will linger in the \"proposed\" stage forever. reply luuurker 9 hours agorootparentprevMusk has criticised Community Notes a few times for calling him out. reply dventimi 9 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20181105214850&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alter... reply kar5pt 6 hours agoprevTheir methodology seems really flawed.

I have been grateful that HN hasn&#x27;t had the same level of animosity about the conflict in Gaza as other places on the internet. But this news article is about a core issue in tech, and should be discussed on HN. The whole world now uses social media to communicate, which means that when there&#x27;s a war, partisans of both sides will be motivated to fight out the propaganda war on the platforms that tech built.I wonder if there will ever be a way for a global-sized platform which uses algorithmic content feeds to convincingly show moderation neutrality on a topic like this. The HRW report has 1,000 examples of peaceful pro-Palestinian content that was removed by Meta. But only Meta themselves has the information to know whether there is systematic bias. So we get a situation where people sympathetic to both sides both come away feeling that the platform is biased. I think the U.S. culture war has similar dynamics.My engineer brain wants to solve this by giving users more visibility into moderation decisions. Maybe statistics on deleted posts, more legible moderation rules, publicly posted justifications for moderation decisions. Another part of my brain thinks that maybe this is just an unsolvable problem for social reasons in a community that&#x27;s global-scale. I&#x27;m not sure. I do feel like this is still Meta&#x27;s job, part of their cost of doing business, and if they put something like 5% of their revenue into moderation the situation would be a lot better.In the meantime I find myself personally trying to cut out as many algorithmic feeds as I can from my life.

This could go on till the ultimate simplification of doing nothing more than printing out the lyrics, but you get the idea. This is one of the better obfuscated C programs I've come across because of using the substitution cipher along with recursion. That was followed by the addition of a small bit of unnecessary code and use of random arguments when the arguments were in fact not made use of. A very nice little bundle of C code! Understanding what's happening is still a long way from writing it. What a great example of creativity. Merry Christmas! Mike Markowski, mike.ab3ap -A- gmail -D- com",

So I couldn&#x27;t compile it with gcc (which is clang) on the Mac, but it compiles just fine with gcc on Linux.It&#x27;s really astonishing that we can compile 35 years old code with our current tooling.

I suppose to be REALLY fair, though, you have to count the bytes of code in the compiler itself. A convenient enough implementation of compression could index into the C compiler binary to find the bytes it needs. (For example, my GCC contains \"first\", \"second\", and \"third\" in the binary, which a sufficiently clever implementation could make use of. \"Exit on the first error occurred.\", \"Append a second underscore if the name already contains an underscore.\", \"Warn about suspicious calls to memset where the third argument is constant literal zero and the second is not.\", etc. I didn&#x27;t check but I doubt turtle doves or maids-a-milking come up that often in the description of warning flags.) reply arp242 14 hours agorootparentzstd didn&#x27;t exist in 1988. reply jrockway 11 hours agorootparentThis article was posted to HN today, in 2023! reply arp242 11 hours agorootparentAnd that comment was clearly written in 1988.

On the way in from the airport, Horowitz asked them to stop at the lab and show him what was going on. They said there was plenty of time and they would get started the next morning.

Not only covers are different (the title in the copy is actually shifted to the rightmost part just as seen in Amazon which immediately makes you think about a counterfeit copy) but the quality of the paper, quality of the cover (both front and back cover bend) and print are different. It feels like the book was printed by a copy center.Taking a more detailed look at the back it turns out that these alternate versions are printed by Amazon in Italy (despite the fun fact that the very first page states that indeed the copy I have was printed and bound in the USA).So be very careful to purchase books from Amazon, you can get surprises like these. I used to buy from book depository and as it was indeed another business from Amazon I thought that they would still offer quality books behind scenes, but it seems to be room for Amazon to now also get involved in the business of printing low quality books.While I was confirmed that indeed the copy I received is not a counterfeit I find it very dodgy for Amazon to do this without at least explicitly mention it in the site. reply tshirttime 11 hours agoprevDense, wordy, incomprehensible.

The fact that they touch on so much in the book makes it useful as a \"Wikipedia\" starting point.I agree that you should not learn from this book from zero. The first few chapters attempt to be an intro but it&#x27;s not intended to be a gentle introduction. reply scarecrowbob 6 hours agorootparentThis year I started picking up on fixing analog electronics as an extension of my stage hand&#x2F; audio engineering&#x2F; etc work. It&#x27;s fun and feels nice when I can actually fix something, plus it&#x27;s a cash business.For instance, on my own I was able to identify a bad opamp on the in input section of a mixer and rework it (after replacing a bunch of electrolytics and a couple smd transistors, cause I am a novice at this kind of work). Still, I&#x27;m not totally a stranger to electronics.I started in on that book- I kind of agree with the preceding comments.I plan to come back to it, but I have been watching a lot of youtube, and that has felt a lot more helpful in a lot of ways. I mostly am interested in learning to reason about what is happening in analog circuits so I can eventually clone some instruments and signal processing- maybe I am not the audience for the book.Like Aaron Lanterman&#x27;s lectures at Georgia Tech are feeling a whole lot more useful to my interests (granted, I am mostly trying to understand analog electronics because that is what folks bring me that need to be fixed).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;playlist?list=PLOunECWxELQSbOv3ekzuw...Similarly, following Moritz Klein&#x27;s discussions has been quite helpful... the whole \"here is what we&#x27;re going to build\" and then following through with things has felt very siilar to Ben Eater&#x27;s series on microprocessors.Still, the chummy ivy-leage tone of TAE wasn&#x27;t super duper fun for me. I will probably keep returning to it until I can get through it quickly, but for my purposes (and I suspect a lot of folks who aren&#x27;t on an academic path) it&#x27;s not maybe the quickest, strongest path to a lot of ends. reply tmalsburg2 1 hour agoparentprevHow can it be dense and wordy at the same time?

Look for surplus departments at local colleges, labs, companies, etc. too. Find out where e-waste goes, and whether you can salvage from it before it gets hauled away. Lots of stuff likely gets thrown out that either still works, can be fixed, or can be used for parts. Downside is you have to plan projects around what you found instead of just buying parts after picking a project. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Choosing sounds and MIDI instruments. Experimenting with different effects, tweaking every parameter precisely and playing around (using your ears for feedback) until you find something you like. Finally, mixing the tracks together so the whole thing sounds cohesive. (time required: ~1 hour, min.)To me, it seems hard to confuse the two processes.You may very well argue that the ‚ÄòAI‚Äô is doing something analogous to human music production (well‚Ä¶ architecturally it isn‚Äôt, but you could at least argue it‚Äôs equivalent in some sense), but arguing that the human who typed the prompt ‚Äòwrote the song‚Äô seems to be‚Ä¶ to put it lightly, rather overstating it. reply adroniser 19 hours agorootparentprevYou don&#x27;t have much control over what is being generated. And if you did want to have fine control then what would be the difference compared to just dicking around on a synthesizer?A lot of the enjoyment of music comes from connecting emotionally with the artist. The artist had something to say based on their experience of life and adversity. You relate maybe because you&#x27;ve been there too. After all, you and the artist are both just human at the end of the day.This is why for instance I have a hard time believing in AI girlfriends or AI therapists. It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t think that an AI could learn to be empathetic and say the right things at the right time, it&#x27;s that I think there is something about you the human knowing it is an AI speaking that would make you not be able to connect.

What part of \"make\" implies fine-grained control over the output? Parents didn&#x27;t have much control over what&#x27;s generated when a child is, but by any reasonable definition of the word \"make\", the baby that comes out is \"made\" by the mother and (to a lesser extent) the father!> A lot of the enjoyment of music comes from connecting emotionally with the artist. The artist had something to say based on their experience of life and adversity. You relate maybe because you&#x27;ve been there too.I think you might be assuming that your experience generalizes a lot more than it does. I&#x27;ve been a musician for decades, and I&#x27;m constantly listening to music, and I don&#x27;t need to know who did what to be able to enjoy a song. To be clear, there&#x27;s nothing _wrong_ with that being part of your enjoyment, but there&#x27;s nothing wrong with just liking to hear sounds that sound \"good\" without caring about where they came from. reply adroniser 18 hours agorootparentI am definitely generalizing. It does seem to be a common sentiment expressed when this gets brought up though. Whether it&#x27;s just an instance of me clinging on to anything to distinguish from AI or if it&#x27;s a legitimate problem remains to be seen I guess.And there definitely are songs I feel I just enjoy in their own right.As for &#x27;make&#x27; I guess that just comes down to semantics. reply saghm 18 hours agorootparentHow do you reconcile the fact that music from people who have done pretty despicable things can still be widely popular? You can certainly argue that enough people are willing to look past someone being a murderer or child abuser or something because they still can find some sort of human connection with the artist, but given how uncommon that sort of sentiment is in basically every other part of life, it seems far more likely that people just don&#x27;t really think about it an artist at all when they listen to their music if the artist is someone they wouldn&#x27;t want to connect with. reply adroniser 18 hours agorootparentDo you think people would listen to Kanye if it wasn&#x27;t Kanye? reply saghm 17 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think his personality was really that much of an outlier when his music first became popular, so I&#x27;d argue that empirically the answer is yes. From looking at Wikipedia, his first album was released in 2004 and charted at number 2, with his first single hitting 15 on the charts and his follow-up being number 1. I don&#x27;t think you can argue that he was famous enough for anyone to be listening to the music because they knew who he was rather than because of the music itself. reply majormajor 14 hours agorootparentNobody needs to know who the artist ahead of time is to connect to what they say (instrumentally or vocally). The art does the talking.I largely agree that if you don&#x27;t know anything about music but generate some stuff with a very-high-level AI tool then you are unlikely to produce anything that resonates with people for any significant amount of time.If you do know something about music (say, producer- or other-tastemaker level) and you replace the artists with an AI tool - you could have much better luck - but I&#x27;m curious there how much longetivity you get. Could you create the next star or the next trend or will the tools not have the ability to \"break the mold\" in ways that really connect to audiences and new generations without being used by newcomers themselves? reply saghm 7 hours agorootparent> I largely agree that if you don&#x27;t know anything about music but generate some stuff with a very-high-level AI tool then you are unlikely to produce anything that resonates with people for any significant amount of time.I feel like you&#x27;re not really making a strong assertion here because of how subjective \"resonates with people for any significant amount of time\" is. Instead, I&#x27;d propose something akin to the Turing test; instead of conversing with someone and trying to determine if they&#x27;re a computer or a human, the participant would listen to to a piece of music and try to guess whether it was made \"traditionally\" or by someone who used an AI tool and had no experience making music in any other fashion. I think we&#x27;re not far from the point where it would be possible to generate instrumental music with AI that would be indistinguishable from a control set of human-created music (either instrumental or with the vocal track removed from the mix) with a certain level of complexity (let&#x27;s say songs without changes in tempo, time signature, or key, which would give us at absolute minimum a few thousand popular mainstream songs over the past half century, and potentially a lot more). How long do you think it will take for this to be possible (if ever)? If you don&#x27;t think it will ever be possible, why not? And if you do think it will be possible, isn&#x27;t this sufficient evidence that there isn&#x27;t any inherent need for a \"human\" element in music? reply whywhywhywhy 9 hours agorootparentprevIt‚Äôs not about that.

I don‚Äôt really care about Lady Gaga life experience to enjoy her songs. I have no idea who created half of the songs on my Spotify playlist. Artists create brief virtual life experiences through their songs. Songs I like usually remind me about something I have experienced or would like to experience. reply lacrimacida 19 hours agorootparentprevI agree about music. When it comes to girlfriends and therapists when the medium is text the connection could be faked with a large corpus and RLHF. Keep in mind that some people already have inflatable girlfriends. It aint pretty but may serve some purpose for disfunctional people. I‚Äôd get more worried if it becomes a bigger thing.When it comes to chat therapy, it could be an interesting mode of self discovery.

I wouldn&#x27;t focus on the quality of the output, beyond the threshold which allows the artists to generate a reasonable idea of what they eventually want to make.Think about all the hard work that traditionally goes into composing a single title. Artists will spend days, weeks and sometimes months trying to iterate on ideas. Writing, composing, demoing, tracking and recording, mixing, etc. Think about all of the expensive software and hardware that goes into this process (instruments, microphones, studios, DAWs, VSTs, etc). It&#x27;s an expensive and difficult process, it&#x27;s very manual, very sequential.This could easily be used to speed up that iterative process.

Hochul vetoes ban on noncompete clauses, waters down LLC transparency bill Rick Friedman via Getty Images By Jon Campbell Published Dec 23, 2023 Share We rely on your support to make local news available to all Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2023. Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations New York will create a database that will identify the names of owners of many limited liability companies within the state for the first time. But the public won‚Äôt be able to access it, thanks to a legislative amendment secured by Gov. Kathy Hochul‚Äôs office. The Democratic governor signed 42 bills late Friday and vetoed another 43, part of an end-of-year push to clear her desk of legislation approved by state lawmakers earlier this year. Among the bills she signed was the LLC Transparency Act, a measure that will force limited liability companies to list their ‚Äúbeneficial owners‚Äù when they create a new company or change the structure of a current one. The bill‚Äôs sponsors pushed the measure as a way for New York residents to, for example, find out who their true landlord is if their building is owned by an otherwise nameless LLC. But Hochul negotiated an amendment to the bill that will keep that database from the public. Instead, she said, that information will only be maintained for law-enforcement purposes, such as if a district attorney needs to access it for an investigation. ‚ÄúThe bill as drafted was overly broad, and required changes to ensure it serves the core purpose of exposing unlawful activity while balancing personal privacy,‚Äù Hochul wrote in a memo. Among the other bills Hochul acted on late Friday: Hochul vetoed a bill that would have effectively banned noncompete agreements, which employers use to prevent their employees from going to work for a competitor for a period of time after their employment. She also vetoed a bill that would have required New York City to install recycling bins at every park, playground and historical site in the five boroughs, arguing it would have placed an unfunded mandate on the city. She approved a bill that will move many county- and town-level elections to even-numbered years, much to the chagrin of Republicans. Major business interests, including Wall Street firms and the state Business Council, lobbied Hochul to reject the ban on noncompete clauses, arguing they are necessary to protect trade secrets and retain talent. They argued companies would move jobs out of state if New York were to enact the ban. Hochul had previously floated a compromise that would allow the ban only to apply to those with salaries under $250,000. But in a statement, bill sponsor Sen. Sean Ryan of Buffalo said Hochul rejected the Legislature‚Äôs final offer, which he says would have ceded to the $250,000 cap but indexed it to inflation and exempted all medical workers. In her veto message, Hochul said she was trying to find a compromise that protected middle-class and lower-wage workers while allowing businesses ‚Äúto retain highly compensated talent.‚Äù She said she‚Äôs ‚Äúopen to future legislation that achieves that right balance.‚Äù The bill Hochul signed moving many town- and county-level elections to even years will be phased in over the coming years, eventually aligning them with federal elections in a move supporters say is designed to boost voter turnout. Republicans deeply opposed the measure, accusing Democrats of orchestrating the change to benefit from New York‚Äôs traditionally heavy Democratic turnout in presidential election years. Stephen Acquario, executive director of the state Association of Counties, an organization that lobbies for county governments, criticized Hochul for signing the bill into law. ‚ÄúAt a time when we should be keeping the divisiveness at the federal and state levels out of our local communities, this bill does the opposite, burying the local issues that impact New Yorkers‚Äô daily lives at the back of exceedingly long ballots,‚Äù he said in a statement. In a statement Friday afternoon, Hochul said the measure is ‚Äúabout expanding to the ballot box and promoting a more inclusive democracy.‚Äù While the measure would not apply to New York City (or other city) elections or positions like district attorney ‚Äî which are set by the state constitution ‚Äî Hochul said she would support a constitutional amendment to adjust the election calendar to ‚Äúto save taxpayer dollars and avoid voter fatigue.‚Äù But such a move would be several years away; changing the constitution is a multi-year process, and then any change would have to be gradually phased in after that. The governor‚Äôs action on the batch of bills leaves just five pieces of legislation to approve or reject by the end of the calendar year. That includes a measure known as the Grieving Families Act, which, if signed, would make it easier for family members to seek civil damages for their grief and anguish in wrongful death cases. Another pending bill would make changes to the state‚Äôs nascent public-campaign-finance system, which good-government advocates oppose.

In my country (slovenia), if the company wants you to sign a noncompete, they have to decide the length of the noncompete (months, years after you quit) and a monetary compensation has to be written in for the duration of the noncompete. The wording is kinda loose and a few \"decided by the court\", but this would be an interesting compromise, especially if tweaked a little. So, if you get employed and educated for an eg. rocket scientist, and the company wants you to sign a noncompete, so you could only get a job as a burger flipper, the company would have to pay the difference between what you earn due to a noncompete, and what you&#x27;d earn if you continued working the same job (so your previous pay plus inflation + some added percentage as a safety margin). reply NotSammyHagar 8 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think there is any reason for noncompetes. They won&#x27;t pay me if one makes me unemployable. They should be generally disallowed. They only help companies restrict their employee&#x27;s mobility. reply CSMastermind 7 hours agoparentprevThis is basically how it works in many finance jobs in NYC. Companies pay you for the duration of your non-compete normally at your base salary.The one catch is that 50%+ of your compensation in these jobs is typically a yearly bonus which is not paid during your non-compete period.But pretty much everyone knows this and socks away some money to limit the shock.

It‚Äôs not that you can‚Äôt compete against us in general or use general techniques, but for 30&#x2F;60&#x2F;90 days you have specific knowledge of ongoing operations you can‚Äôt use.The hiring firm pays for, but cannot use, the hired person. reply JustLurking2022 5 hours agorootparentprevNo, it&#x27;s up to the individual company to continue paying those employees. reply foota 3 hours agorootparentParent is saying that noncompetes affect more than finance companies, and other companies may not pay for them in the same way. reply lotsofpulp 4 hours agorootparentprev>There&#x27;s some grumbling here and there but legislation like the one proposed in NYC would have needlessly broken a system that works pretty well.The system needs to be broken.

And many (most?) of this group would have the leverage to turn down an undesirable offer. reply reaperman 5 hours agorootparentArby‚Äôs, Auntie Anne‚Äôs, Buffalo Wild Wings, Carl‚Äôs Jr., Cinnabon, Jimmy John‚Äôs, McDonald‚Äôs, and Subway have all made low-wage workers sign non competes. reply randomdata 3 hours agorootparentThe only leverage those employers have over those people is the &#x27;fun factor&#x27;. There is, just in food service alone never mind other industries, many, many other low-wage (but with tips!) restaurants with names you&#x27;ve never heard of champing at the bit to hire those people instead.However, it&#x27;s also kind of meaningless for that kind of job. Some small risk of never being able to flip fast food burgers again? Oh well. What have you lost? The aforementioned fun tends to be short-lived anyway and people know that going into it. reply reaperman 2 hours agorootparentNot necessarily true in many small towns across rural USA. If the major holding companies, e.g. Yum! Brands, McDonald&#x27;s, etc. have all of their brands doing non-competes there might be only 2 independent fast-food joints within a 45-minute drive and few other jobs available. reply randomdata 2 hours agorootparentIf that scenario ever played out, the workers would not be able to sign the agreement, so the employer would just have to concede. It would be far more costly to close down business (unless it was going to close anyway, in which case your comment is moot) than to take a stand and hire nobody.Bedsides, if we want to pretend that in your made up scenario that the workers did somehow end up signing the agreements, the employers would quickly run out of people to hire. A small town ‚Äì one too far away from anything else for others to come in to work ‚Äì and where everyone has legally taken themselves out of the job market is not a good place to be in as an employer. While employers can benefit from non-competes under certain conditions, they are not universally beneficial.You offer a fun thought experiment, but in reality a non-compete would not be offered here in the first place. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentYou&#x27;re somehow speaking as if this isn&#x27;t already happening, at least per the other comment.Also, if you think McDonald&#x27;s is going to change a corporate policy rather than operate a few stores below capacity or even close them down, you have a really skewed view of the relative power of low pay non-union workers... replypalemoonale 29 minutes agorootparentprev> when they could literally go to any other job?Can they, though?

This can mean that statewide officials such as the governor are from a party that more state voters support, while the state legislature is comprised of the opposite party, whose voters are more engaged in off years and smaller local elections. Michigan, for example, has had exclusively Democratic US Senators for a long time but the state legislature spent a long time controlled by Republicans.2) Many state legislatures have appallingly gerrymandered districts to reinforce the party in power. Wisconsin, for instance, is very much a \"purple\" state (a close mix of Republican and Democratic voters), but its state legislature has Republican supermajorities due to gerrymandering. reply couchand 7 hours agorootparentThose don&#x27;t describe New York politics in the slightest.New York&#x27;s governor has been a Democrat since Pataki gave up the job in 2006.

They&#x27;re not really a rational thing in any other domain.Basically, if you have a zero sum game with two companies and one has better IP than the other, it makes sense for the time span through which the company without can&#x27;t reverse engineer it. In every other case it means the groups of companies under the umbrella of non-competes will slowly loose to groups of companies in jurisdictions without non-competes.To expand on that, if you objectively have some special sauce that you don&#x27;t want leaked to your competition then it&#x27;s a net gain for you and a loss for the rest of X industry (where X is finance because they&#x27;re the ones who want this, not tech). In reality though, it&#x27;s extremely rare to have sole control over an incredibly strong piece of IP that defines a market. In reality, everyone thinks they do because they don&#x27;t know what anyone else has. Everyone has something that gives them an edge, hence being competitive in the market, but sharing those secrets within their local area can make the whole industry way more performant.The law applies to everyone so if you can&#x27;t have non-competes, neither can your competition. At a local level it will make groups of companies much stronger than their more distant competitors because they can share knowledge under the table at a much higher rate. reply briHass 10 hours agoparentprevThe argument is essentially that a noncompete is a voluntary contract, and generally the courts don&#x27;t want to prevent individuals from freely entering into agreements.

You can see this in a lot of small service-based business too.

They didn&#x27;t have to! The answer is always: \"I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten the job without it.\" Exactly. The job would have still been filled. No company is going to not hire a needed worker just because nobody will sign a non-compete. But the company would have hired an otherwise better candidate instead.In other words, the person who signed the non-compete gets to screw over other workers now just by giving up a small chance of not being able to do a certain job for some duration in the future.

If there was not mutual benefit, there would be no reason to sign the contract.The state may have concern if that mutual benefit is harmful to the rest of society. A medical doctor, for example, agreeing to not compete could see him no longer able to provide medical services, which could see a third-party to not receive the care they need.

They both have an incentive to disenfranchise voters, because our great loophole is that, a \"no\" vote actually does not count in any meaningful way.So, if you can get 50% to 75% of the eligible population to not vote, then it becomes much easier to maintain power without actually having to take any responsibility for your actions.It should be that if less than 50% of the eligible population turns out, the election is null, and needs to be re-run.

If Australians can \"understand\" and \"tolerate\" it, why not Americans too?> Anything more complicated than \" gets my vote.\" is impractically useless.In America, campaign signs say \"Vote For Whoever\". In Australia, they say \"Vote 1 For Whoever\" instead. No real difference. Some people just fill out the rest of the boxes randomly, some people follow a \"how to vote\" card issued by their preferred candidate, some people think hard about who gets their 2nd&#x2F;3rd&#x2F;4th etc. Some Australian states now have \"optional preferential\", where your vote is still valid even if you don&#x27;t make a 2nd&#x2F;3rd&#x2F;etc choice. reply hedora 6 hours agorootparentprevRanked choice isn‚Äôt that complicated, but anyway, Australia has a reverse poll tax (they fine you for not showing up, but you can turn in a blank ballot for free).Apparentlyis a perennially competitive write in candidate.It still seems better than the US system (especially vs. here in California, where we have a one party system, and primaries are often uncontestable). reply throwup238 5 hours agorootparent> It still seems better than the US system (especially vs. here in California, where we have a one party system, and primaries are often uncontestable).Huh? California has had jungle primaries for years. The top two candidates with the most votes in the primaries run in the general election, even if they&#x27;re both from the same party. That makes the primaries a lot more competitive than usual like when Kevin de Le√≥n (D) ran against Dianne Feinstein (D) for the US Senate seat in 2018.The only chance Republicans even have of running against a Democrat is when the Democrat is so popular that no one bothers running. This past gubernatorial election, the next closest Democrat won 50x less votes than Newsom so Brian Dahle (R) got to go to the general election with only 17% of the total turnout (Newsom had 56% in the primaries and won the general with 59%).Ever since we managed to extricate the GOP from state government, one party rule has been going pretty well.

I&#x27;ve looked at state level data for a few states, and while I have seen higher turnout in Presidential elections, I see very low and declining turnout in those Primaries which I think just causes the same problem and allows the general election turnout to mask this problem.Then, looking at off year and congressional elections, the data is much less hopeful.

Welfare and education for mothers and their young children? Rejected. Food stamps?

They turn on themselves with sectarian infighting. And there&#x27;s nothing Democrats in general and New York Democrats in particular hate more progressive candidates.In a district Biden won by 8 in 2020, George Santos was elected in 2022 when Republicans nationally underperformed. And this is a guy who would&#x27;ve been exposed by a $500 background check. Over $100 million was spent to lose to Lindsey Graham by 10 while nothing was spent on Mandela Barnes in Wisconsin who lost by a mere 20,000 votes.I mention all of this as context because Democrats are beholden to the same corporate interests. Their goal isn&#x27;t to make progressive change. It&#x27;s not even to win elections. It&#x27;s really just to fund raise off of how terrible the other side is without the responsibility of having to do anything.My position on noncompetes is a fairly simple one: when you quit, the employer has the option to enforce their noncompete. If they do for whatever the agreed upon period is they pay you 150% of your highest annual total compensation (not just salary) including benefits over the previous 5 years. for that period. Or they can not. It&#x27;s all or nothing. Failure to pay at any point in that period removes the noncompete from the employer but doesn&#x27;t discharge the liability. That is, once a noncompete is exercised the employer is on the hook for the entire amount and needs to keep papying on time to keep that noncompete enforced.Does that sound harsh (on the employer)? It&#x27;s meant to be. Don&#x27;t want to pay a noncompete? Then don&#x27;t enforce it. reply santoshalper 11 hours agoprev [17 more] [flagged] BryantD 10 hours agoparentI‚Äôm not going to argue with your core point, but New York is a state where the Working Families Party successfully beat the centrist Republican-aligned Independent Democrat Conference in the state Senate.

Faster generation Replace the following code in the above example. pipe.enable_xformers_memory_efficient_attention() To from streamdiffusion.acceleration.tensorrt import accelerate_with_tensorrt stream = accelerate_with_tensorrt( stream, \"engines\", max_batch_size=2, ) It requires TensorRT extension and time to build the engine, but it will be faster than the above example. Optionals Stochastic Similarity Filter Stochastic Similarity Filter reduces processing during video input by minimizing conversion operations when there is little change from the previous frame, thereby alleviating GPU processing load, as shown by the red frame in the above GIF. The usage is as follows: stream = StreamDiffusion( pipe, [32, 45], torch_dtype=torch.float16, ) stream.enable_similar_image_filter( similar_image_filter_threshold, similar_image_filter_max_skip_frame, ) There are the following parameters that can be set as arguments in the function: similar_image_filter_threshold The threshold for similarity between the previous frame and the current frame before the processing is paused. similar_image_filter_max_skip_frame The maximum interval during the pause before resuming the conversion. Residual CFG (RCFG) RCFG is a method for approximately realizing CFG with competitive computational complexity compared to cases where CFG is not used. It can be specified through the cfg_type argument in the StreamDiffusion. There are two types of RCFG: one with no specified items for negative prompts RCFG Self-Negative and one where negative prompts can be specified RCFG Onetime-Negative. In terms of computational complexity, denoting the complexity without CFG as N and the complexity with a regular CFG as 2N, RCFG Self-Negative can be computed in N steps, while RCFG Onetime-Negative can be computed in N+1 steps. The usage is as follows: # w/0 CFG cfg_type = \"none\" # CFG cfg_type = \"full\" # RCFG Self-Negative cfg_type = \"self\" # RCFG Onetime-Negative cfg_type = \"initialize\" stream = StreamDiffusion( pipe, [32, 45], torch_dtype=torch.float16, cfg_type=cfg_type, ) stream.prepare( prompt=\"1girl, purple hair\", guidance_scale=guidance_scale, delta=delta, ) The delta has a moderating effect on the effectiveness of RCFG.

I&#x27;m away from my GPU for a few days. It&#x27;s always hard to judge generative papers without getting hands on because you write to the reviewers which means you gotta cherry pick (I think this is bad, but it&#x27;s where we&#x27;re at). They&#x27;re using tiny autoencoder? Artspew did that too and was getting higher FPS (but weren&#x27;t using TensorRT but were using triton) but the quality was garbage (still cool).

Or do inputs need to be batched together to get that average throughput? reply stale2002 9 hours agoparentI haven&#x27;t tried it, but just taking an educated guess, which is that I don&#x27;t think batching should be required.The slow part for models is loading the model up. But once the model is up, you can send it whatever input that you want.Parsing and sending the image data just doesn&#x27;t pass my gut check as to what would be the bottleneck here. reply godelski 4 hours agorootparentEveryone does warmup before you measure. But measuring isn&#x27;t always done right because we actually measure the GPU time only but some people naively use CPU time which is problematic because the process is asynchrenous. They have a few timing scripts though and I&#x27;m away from my GPU. There are some interesting things but they look like they know how to time. But it can also get confusing because is it considering batches or not. Some works do batch some do single. Only problem is when it isn&#x27;t communicated correctly or left ambiguous.Their paper is ambiguous unfortunately. Abstract, intro, and conclusion suggests single image by motivating with sequential generation (specifically mentioning metaverse). Experiment section says> We note that we evaluate the throughput mainly via the average inference time per image through processing 100 images.That implies batch along with their name Stream Batch...Looking at the code I&#x27;m a bit confused. I&#x27;m away from my GPU so can&#x27;t run. Maybe someone can let me know? This block[0] measures correctly but is using a downloaded image? Then just opens the image in the preprocess? (multi looks identical) This block[1] is using CPU? But running CPU. (there&#x27;s another like this)So I&#x27;m quite a bit confused tbh.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cumulo-autumn&#x2F;StreamDiffusion&#x2F;blob&#x2F;03e2a7...[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;cumulo-autumn&#x2F;StreamDiffusion&#x2F;blob&#x2F;03e2a7... reply modeless 9 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not the issue, the issue is GPU utilization. Batching enables higher utilization and higher images per second throughput, but doesn&#x27;t improve latency. reply Kubuxu 8 hours agorootparentIn essence batching allows for more efficient usage of memory bandwidth. Without batching for every generation you need to transfer the whole model from GPU memory to GPU core once for every image which sets an upper bound on speed. With batching the bottlenecks start showing up elsewhere.For SD1.5 4090 is able to do ~17it&#x2F;s without batching and ~90-100it&#x2F;s with batching.Although these numbers might be old at this point, I looked at it ~3mo ago. reply kristopolous 9 hours agoprevThis more or less just worked as documented. Most of these demos tend to blow up and give really wonky deep errors.Good job. Give it a try.

It&#x27;s like the authors are trying to sell me on them as researchers, instead of helping me understand their research (y&#x27;know, the entire reason journals got started??). An entire section for \"stream batching\" was just too much, and none of their ideas were innovative or unique. It was incredibly dense, simply because it&#x27;s obfuscated, which makes me believe the authors themselves don&#x27;t really understand what they&#x27;re doing.The results aren&#x27;t even very good. They claim 60x speedup, but compared to what? HuggingFace&#x27;s Diffusers Autopipeline... a company notorious for buggy code and inefficient pipelines.

You write papers to reviewers. But your reviewers are stochastic so it&#x27;s hard to write to them because they may or may not be in your niche.I&#x27;ll add though that this isn&#x27;t why journals were created and that CS&#x2F;ML doesn&#x27;t typically use journals ({T,J}MLR, PAMI, and a few exist, sure) and instead write to conferences. Fixed dates, zero sum, 1.5 shot setting (1 rebuttal, zero revisions). Journals were created for dissemination of papers, indirectly about communicating to one another, but you know... now we got Arxiv and blogs and websites are sometimes way better just like how papers got better with pictures with computer graphics. reply kristopolous 8 hours agoparentprevSomehow just hacking together code to create something is considered publishable these days. The code works but it really is just pasted together stuff from the last few weeks of research. reply godelski 3 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I have a problem with this tbh. Though this specifically looks more engineering and product oriented. What I do have a problem with is comparing papers across vastly different TRLs and comparing works done with 100 GPU years of compute to works with 1 GPU year (or less). Just completely different class of works and comparing is void of context, you know?The reason I don&#x27;t have a problem is I see papers as how we researchers communicate with other researchers. But I feel that&#x27;s not how everyone sees them and there&#x27;s the aspect that this is how we&#x27;re judged so incentives get misaligned with actual goal.

These simulators are becoming very realistic, and I can see them being helpful as an introduction to a subject prior to running the Hobbs meter and paying for actual flight time. Will this experience help or hurt someone who decides to become a real pilot?

Like Abelenky's great answer though, they may never really feel like what it does to have real airflow over the controls [or bounce off the runway]. Long story short it's great for everything (especially emergency procedures) except the real stick and rudder stuff. For that there is nothing like the real thing. ‚Äì p1l0t Jan 16, 2014 at 19:24 3 I have plenty of experience playing with Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is a very good flight simulator.

Show activity on this post. Clarification: This was written about Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX). Parts of the answer probably apply to the new Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020 release), but that isn't what I had in mind when writing this. Maybe a new answer will be appropriate after using MSFS for some time. @Pondlife gave a very good answer, and I'll add a few bits to that. Even after having gotten my license, I still use flight sims (mainly Microsoft FSX and X-Plane 10) for some practice. Before flying into an unfamiliar airport, or over an unfamiliar area, I'll often load it up in a simulator, and fly it. Especially when I was a student, I found this incredibly helpful for my long cross country flights. You can look at a map all you want, but its still not the same as sitting in the simulator, and looking around (\"I see the mountain on my left.... and the lake below me. I can follow this valley all the way to the airport...\" etc). And I've generally found the simulator, with good terrain and textures loaded, can be pretty close to reality. The night before I did a student flight from KBFI to KVUO, I flew the entire thing in FSX. The next day, it really felt pretty much like making the same flight all over again. Based on the landmarks, timing, views, etc, I knew exactly where I was, and I was confident that everything was going right. That said, in my opinion there are some things simulators do very poorly. Some of these are: Takeoffs The application of power and left-turning tendency on the ground just doesn't feel realistic at all. The climb out doesn't feel right. Landings Ground effect is difficult to observe in a simulator. The flare doesn't feel like reality, and touching down (or bouncing) is not realistic at all. Cross Control, Slip, Spin & Unusual Attitudes Anything beyond basic maneuvers up to 30 degrees bank or 20 degrees climb doesn't match reality. This is dependent on your simulator, some perform certain things more realistically than others. Because of these limitations, I would NOT use a flight simulator to try to learn takeoffs, landings, or certain maneuvers. (You can learn the \"procedure\" in a simulator... when to reduce power, when to add flaps. But the \"feel\" will be all wrong). If you're going to try to incorporate flight sim into your training, there are some basic things you should do: Spend LOTS of time configuring it Unlike a video-game, this is not \"plug-n-play\". Spend time learning all the controls. Turn on Realism When adjusting your controls, set all \"null-zones\" to zero, set \"Sensitivity\" to maximum, turn off helpers like \"auto-mixture\" and \"auto-rudder\", etc. (However, I do keep \"Gyro-Drift\" turned off in my sim. Its annoying, and adds little practical value) Turn on Weather The flight simulators typically come pre-setup with zero wind, good weather, standard temperature, etc. Configure yours to pull from real-world weather sources, or add some clouds, a variety of winds, and don't always fly at noon. Set the timing for early morning flights, twilight flights, night flights, etc. Another \"fun\" area where flight simulators can be slightly helpful is in emergency procedures. Typically in real-world training, my instructor told me: \"We're going to practice engine-out emergencies\" and my mind immediately starts preparing for that... And naturally, we have to do them at a safe altitude in a safe area. In a flight simulator, you can set up the computer to give you a random emergency at a random time. You might get the problem on short-final, or over a metro-downtown area. Something that you just can't do in reality. I haven't had any real-life emergencies, so I don't know how accurate a flight simulator is. But I believe that some practice is better than no practice at all, and flight sim lets me fly into storms, icing, get lost in fog, fly approaches below minimums, have an engine seize up on me, etc, all without risking my butt or a $200,000 airframe. Since @Lnafziger suggested more specifically addressing flight training: I do believe that flight sim can help with certain aspects of training, but in other areas, it is no help at all, or actually harmful. Training Areas simulators can help with: Procedures Reviewing steps and procedures before going in the air. For example, for a student, steep turns or stall recovery can be a little nerve wracking at first. It may be much easier (and cheaper) to do it in a sim with an instructor, discussing all the steps and reasons for actions. Then when the student gets in the air, they won't have the \"feel\" for it, but at least the general process is already familiar. Navigation Tuning and identifying VORs, and interpreting the needles can be done just as well be done on the ground as in the air. If the sim has good, realistic terrain (I prefer MegaSceneryEarth), it can also be used for some visual reference lessons. Instrument interpretation Scanning and cross-checking the 6-pack of instruments can be done in a simulator just fine, and a student can practice doing it for long periods of time for a fraction of the cost of flight time. Training Areas simulators are very bad at: On the ground & Outside the plane Anything on the ground, such as taxiing and parking, or anything outside the airplane, such as pre-flight inspection, or weather interpretation, just doesn't work in a sim. Radios I haven't seen any flight sims that really work for the practice of talking on or listening to the radios. (I haven't used VATSIM, which might help). I don't think there's any good substitute for actually flying in a real airspace while simultaneously engaging in real radio conversations. Feel Even the best full-motion sim isn't a substitute for the forces a student feels in a real airplane. This is especially true on ground-reference maneuvers, takeoffs, and landings, where I feel sims fall far short of reality. No one will ever get a \"feel\" for the plane from a simulator.

Show activity on this post. It can definitely help: when I did my instrument rating my instructor used MS FS to walk through (fly through?) various procedures before doing them for real. He also used it for NDB training because the aircraft we used didn't have ADF. I found it very useful, and if I had bought it myself it would probably have saved me a lot of time and money. The main benefit for me was that it lets you run through procedures to practice getting all the steps right and in the right order; I've never used any scenarios like the ones you mentioned so I don't know how useful they are. Another very useful simulator I've used is the Garmin G1000 PC trainer. The G1000 has so many features that trying to identify them all while sitting in an actual aircraft is difficult, even if you have the aircraft available and can pay for it. It also lets you practice various failure modes, which is often difficult to do in the real aircraft. Garmin provides simulators for their 'basic' aviation GPS units too, and they're great for the same reason: you can play around as much as you like. There's no doubt in my mind that they help very significantly. I think that as glass cockpits become more and more common, simulation will become more and more important. They're great tools, but they also bring a lot of complexity and learning how to handle that complexity safely is a lot easier using a simulator. Of course you eventually need to go up, fly, and try out what you've learned for real, but it's no fun trying to flip through a G1000 user guide in flight.

Show activity on this post. I believe that there's an element to this question which has not been covered. This is very much a personal response. Your question specifically asks whether it can help you to learn how to fly or become a better pilot. This is actually two questions in one. Physical and mental limitations not withstanding, I would say that just about anyone can learn how to fly. But I don't believe that everyone who can learn how to fly could be a good pilot. Flying and pilotage are very much more than successfully operating a flying machine in order to fly. It's even a lot more than doing that and following the procedures (ATC, operating in controlled airspace etc) which accompany it. Being a good pilot requires a certain aptitude and attitude (and I'm not talking about what you see on the AH). It needs, let's not beat about the bush, a reasonably good IQ and education. A pilot becomes good when the operation of the machine or the following of the procedures is not enough to to produce a safe, successful conclusion. A good pilot avoids the traps and pitfalls that catch the unwary and have proved the rule, all to often, that in the ongoing contest between the earth and flimsy machines arriving in other than controlled circumstances, the earth has yet to lose. A good pilot takes care of the machine and it's passengers. A good pilot can deal with the unexpected and make sound decisions to continue a flight or not or perhaps even to not commit aviation at all. A good pilot has situational awareness which tells them, via sixth sense, that the bizjet calling left base is a potential threat and is already looking by the time the tower calls. But much more than this, there are some very important elements to flying which a sim can never provide. There is the emotional response; that thrill, that feeling of privilege, that unquantifiable human response to flying that is so much more than operating the machine. There is also a set of skills and mental and physical responses without which, it is not possible to be a \"good pilot\" (IMHO). Let me give a brief background of where I'm coming from and a concrete example of what I mean. I have only a couple of hundred hours. A handful on fixed wing, the rest on helicopters. I also have about 3500 hours \"flying\" big tin on VATSIM (if you are serious about PC simming and don't know about VATSIM, Google for it right now!). In VATSIM, I can operate a 777 (my favourite) very successfully including all of the related procedures which VATSIM does a remarkably good job of simulating. I can fly a SID, follow my planned route, follow a STAR and do a visual onto 26R at Heathrow without breaking sweat, talking to and complying with ATC all the way. I can deal with an unexpected hold or a last minute change of arrival without fluster. I know this all works because I have also been lucky enough to do this in a \"real\" sim (737) and I had no problems at all using the automatics and hand flying the machine for the first 500 and last 1000 feet to depart and arrive safely back at Heathrow. However, when I was learning to fly a helicopter, the reality of it all was very different. Hovering is like learning to ride a bike. I would say anyone with reasonable co-ordination can learn to do it. I can hover all helicopters I've flown with ease. Without even thinking about it. Thing is, I can't really tell you how to do it and I have never been able to keep a PC sim helicopter in the air for more than a few minutes without getting into horrible shape. Try explaining to a child how to ride a bike. I reckon it's impossible. When you switch from lurching around the sky with your instructor calling \"I have control\" every 20 seconds to that magical moment when you are suddenly in a steady hover, there are some things which simply cannot be simulated which your brain needs. The beginners mistake is to focus on the ground, I think most people are looking about 15 metres ahead. You cannot succeed like that. What you want to do is focus your eyes well into the distance and let your peripheral vision do the work. It's almost subconscious and I can't even tell you how it all works but you do realise that you are moving over the ground with subtle cues coming in from your periphery. The second, and more important set of cues, are those that come through the \"seat of your pants\". With a little experience, you just \"know\" when the helicopter moves, even before your peripheral vision has picked up the movement and you've already put that pressure on the cyclic (and it generally is pressure, not movement) to arrest the movement before the machine has deviated from it's position. There are always small movements but to an external observer, you are sitting there, in the air, without so much as a ripple. Subtle sounds are also important. I can tell you pretty much where the rotor RPM is without looking at the tach and can certainly tell instantly when it's going down. The second cue is from the tach but by that time, I'm already on the collective to adjust. The tach just qualifies what I know and shows me that I'm doing the right thing to correct. I'm sure that the fixed wing guys could provide good parallels. My experience on sims tells me that you can indeed learn how to operate the machine and prosecute the procedures around it but it cannot help you to fly, nor to be a good (or better) pilot. Where a sim can help is in teaching you the operation and procedures to the point where your brain is free to concentrate on flying and pilotage and your heart free to enjoy the sensations, because the mechanical stuff has moved into your subconscious and has become muscle memory. Flying is emotional; it's passionate; it's determination; it's personal conquest; it runs in your veins. It's many things more than a sim can ever provide. If you don't get \"Oh I have slipped the surly bonds\", then you are an operator, not a flyer. [EDIT] Am I a good pilot? I'd say I'm average, and striving to be better, but that, in reality, probably describes most pilots, since it is impossible for most to be better than average. I do recognise that I'm in that statistically dangerous zone where I have enough hours to think I'm good but not enough hours to prove it. In my experience, ego and cahonas tell many pilots that they are good pilots ;) Share Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications edited Nov 11, 2014 at 8:31 answered Jan 14, 2014 at 20:45 SimonSimon 31.2k44 gold badges139139 silver badges163163 bronze badges 5 1 Excellent answer about learning to fly!

When simming I probably spent 80% of my time looking at instruments and the moving map and only 20% looking outside. The biggest surprise for me about IRL flying was that these ratios were reversed, at least in VFR. Now being a pilot it is very helpful for practicing procedures, test-flying cross countries, and, with the ground detail in FSX, practicing navigating by reference to ground features (e.g. \"IFR&R\": I Follow Roads and Railroads).

Show activity on this post. Sorry, I know that's not nice to read but all in all I like to answer your question with a no. Flight simulators on your computer doesn't offer the possibility to learn how to actually fly an airplane, they even teach you to act in a different way and in my eyes this might be even very dangerous especially if you only have a little flying experience yet. But there are exceptions: I now don't like to talk about flying but operating an airplane. A flight simulator for sure offers a good possibility to train procedures. To learn instrument approaches you maybe better go into a FNPT but other procedures and flows like organising approaches, work on a proper timing and workflow, practice briefings and even get used to some instruments. Tracking VORs and NDBs outbound from different positions, deciding for the right holding entry and all this stuff. But once again, a PC flight simulator does not teach you flying the actual airplane and can even be a disadvantage for your initial flight training. If you get used to flying and handle your aircraft well, then it probably is a great way to learn more complex operations. Another problem I've often observed is that people who 'trained' a lot on their computer become far too confident on what they are doing and very used to procedures which in the actual plane may not work. Always remember that you are a pilot who likes to learn and use the computer only as a helpful device to get a impression how things basically work. If then questions occur, ask your flight instructor.

It can not teach you to fly. I don't have an answer to the second part of this question. As I've mentioned, in my eyes it can even be counterproductive to work with a simulator during initial flight training. Later on it's really dependent on how you work with the sim and then, that's most important, adapt this in the aircraft. I can do a lot of things on the grount sitting in my sofa hut this doesn't make me a good pilot.

My story: I've been \"playing with\" MS Flight Simulator ever since the first version came out for the original Mac's nine-inch black-and-white monitor. (It only had the Cessna 172, a Learjet, and a Sopwith Camel.) Many years later, while working at Microsoft, I was practically the only person in the office (not USA) able to do the product press demo at the launch of MS Flight Sim 97 (edit: it was more likely FS2000, a major upgrade in 1999). The Cessna is still in there. After the press conference (at an airport!), people were invited to try it for real; we had hired a couple of flight instructors and their ... Cessna's! I was lucky to get the final slot, and I swear that the only thing the flight instructor ever touched was the radio, and the prop angle at take-off! I had never touched a real airplane before (except as an airline passenger, duh) but with my MSFS practice -- even without yoke and pedals -- I just felt right at home and every detail of the 10-minute flight was just as I expected it to be. My own impression is that my flight and landing was considerably smoother than the other \"student\" that I flew with.

Since I was a young kid I was addicted to flight sims. In all honesty, I think that is what really developed my passion for flying - I'm now 18 with a PPL. What I found with MS:FS is that it really helped me in terms of understanding things. For example, how control input = output, how VOR works, and good airmanship. This led me to be 8 lessons ahead of where I should be, when I was 8 lessons in. - What would happen is that I'd go up with my instructor, and the planned lesson would be completed [well] within a few minutes, so they started the next lesson in the air.. 8 times in a row. I give this credit to flight simulator. After what I like to call the \"practical part\" of flying, IE learning how to make the aircraft do as you want, MS:FS stops having a real effect. You cannot properly learn to navigate, talk to ATC, taxi, do checks etc with a flight simulator. And, if you do it properly, you won't find any downsides with learning with one. A common issue is that people may become obsessed with the instruments in a cockpit, and not look outside. Try and stay conscious of how much you use instruments, and I strongly suggest getting a peripheral such as TrackIR, which simulates head movement (best ¬£100 I've ever spent). There are also online groups such as VATSIM which provide advanced tutoring to fly like a professional, with copilots and talking to voluntary certified ATCOs. For a more realistic flight dynamics experience, I recommend Xplane 10, if your computer can handle it. I have some videos on my YouTube channel that show how sims can be useful for some things.

The number one defense contractor in the world. Lockheed Martin purchased the code for Microsoft Flight Simulator and turned it into Prepar3D. Why would the makers of the F-22, F-16, F-35, C-130, C-5 do this if there was not something to it? In today's world of drones, and children growing up with tech, Lockheed figured out an ingenious plan to save the military tons of money and make a profit. By shifting training to a virtual environment including virtual reality software, flight simulators and even full on level D simulators the military will save money. Why spend $14,000 per flight hour for a C-130 when you can simulate it. The full level D is $800 per hour. And $68,362 for a F-22... versus $800. Everything is going virtual in the military.... Even deicing... De-icing simulator Basically you start at what is the equivalent of flight simulator, and work your way up to MFTA's and finally to a level D class sim..... then you move on to the real plane. The key is instruction.... Being a trained pilot, yes you can go back to flight sim and practice.. To conclude.....I am an FAA licensed Private pilot. I also have flown on VATSIM with flight simulator for over 10 years and flown everything from a C-172, to a C-17 to a Boeing 777.... So could I really fly those?? Cessna... yes...but something bigger?? Yes after a very basic briefing by an instructor( takeoff speeds, landing speeds etc...) I solo'd a C-130 on my first flight. Well the Level D one.... at least.

A flight sim cannot \"teach you to fly.\" It can help you practice what you have learned in your flight lessons. there are some caveats: 1) you have to have rudder pedals and a stick or yoke. 2) More monitors is better. 3) Using photorealistic scenery will get you more familiar with area. A home rig with the minimum \"bells and whistles\" can run up to $1,000 or more. That's about 5 hours of real world flight lessons plus ground school (If you shop around). You can learn A LOT in 5 hours of flight training.

(You can of course add extras to the rig, and over time probably will, but that's unrelated in my mind.) The marginal cost of extra airframes is also zero, so you can try things that you don't dare try in a real aircraft, or which you fail at (compare Mike Dunlavey's comment on his crosswind landings).

I like it for a hobby and I like to plan flights, I don't expect to be a real pilot and I don't expect to jump into a plane and fly it I'm not that crazy, but I notice that began to know the instruments and what they are used for, I love FSX and I'm proud of being a FSX Pilot. I know one thing for sure is that I have great respect for the pilots who do fly real airplanes. Another I like about FSX is that I can fly whatever aircraft I want to and don't have to pay or rent an airplane. I can't afford flight lessons so flying on the simulator is fun and can be very challenging especially when it comes to landing. For me I don't take it as a game but I take it as a learning tool, just in case I do decide to go to flight training, like I said earlier, I would not jump in a real airplane and try to fly it I would take flight lessons first, and hope that what I learn from the Flight Simulator would help me advance quicker.

Show activity on this post. Yes it can. That is the purpose of a flight simulator. In fact, they are designed to help improve your judgement. Even though most simulators do not achieve this feel perfectly, your brain senses an upcoming object as the source, and therefore, your judgement comes into play. However, flight simulators do not give you the full experience, such as fear. Many times people get scared on their first flight. I suggest looking at guides or manuals of planes to completely operate them to their full potential. Think of flying a plane almost like driving a car. You need quick judgement to apply the brakes, and not get scared when a car drives too close. Though it is not completely comparable to a car, it takes a lot less time to stop it then to safely stop a airplane. Now I'm not an expert on flight, but I know enough.

Show activity on this post. The original poster does not notice that he/she is actually asking two different questions: learn to fly, and learn to become a better pilot. The value of a sim (any sim!) to learn to fly is VERY (extremely) limited. You get no feeling for the tactile movements and responses in the plane. For that reason the FAA also allows only 2.5 hours credit of sim time (even in an AATD, an Advanced Aviation Training Device) for the PPL, as per AC 61-136. So the value of a desktop sim is even less -- given that the value of even an AATD is so limited. The value of using a sim (incl. a desktop sim) to learn to become a better pilot is much higher. And here too, the FAA recognizes this with higher credit in the AC 61-136, such as 20 hours for the IR and 25 hours for the CPL.

(aviation.stackexchange.com) 232 points by ent101 8 hours ago| hidepastfavorite130 comments inoffensivename 6 hours agoI&#x27;m an airline pilot and an instructor. If you spend thousands of hours in a flight simulator, you&#x27;re probably the type of person who will try to absorb all the information you can about flying airplanes. This kind of person will probably do well when learning to fly the real thing. There will be a lot of bad habits to break, not the least of which is a fixation on the instruments.I do not recommend somebody go and spend time on a simulator to do their VFR training, it&#x27;s a waste of time. You will learn far faster in the real plane and your time not flying is better spent studying the books.Just one (not so humble) pilot&#x2F;instructor&#x27;s opinion.EDIT: for IFR flying, the simulator is very useful, but I would recommend using it under the guidance of an instrument instructor. It&#x27;s easy to pick up bad habits otherwise. reply cyborgrising 20 minutes agoparentThere could potentially be some application for VR. I know a lot of the VFR scan is checking visual landmarks relative to wingtips, etc. I wonder if a good stick and rudder setup with a VR headset and working out of an actual private pilot&#x27;s manual might represent a more helpful experience.That said, I don&#x27;t even know if VR is supported by Ms flight simulator. reply fsniper 15 minutes agorootparentIt&#x27;s. And it&#x27;s really fantastic. reply beefield 3 hours agoparentprevI have flown gliders when I was younger and occasionally thought about PPL. And I have thought sims as well. Given the glider backcround, am I going to learn bad things on a sim? reply vdqtp3 2 hours agorootparentGlider is widely recommended as an entry to powered flight. You&#x27;ll be better prepared and will have better stick and rudder skills than most student pilots. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 1 hour agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s IFR and VFR? reply chrisandchris 1 hour agorootparentInstrument and Visual Flight Rules; flight using basically only instruments, or relying on visual sight of things reply krisoft 11 minutes agorootparentprevchrisandchris described it perfectly. I will just add some additional info. (Funnily enough my name is Krisz :) so you will have info from chrisandchris and Krisz ;))VFR is the type of flying everyone starts at first with, and then later in your training you learn IFR.There are generally 3 big ‚Äúproblems‚Äù a pilot has to solve. They have to keep the plane flying straight and level, they have to keep from hitting things (other airplanes, terrain, buildings, etc), and they have to get to where they want to go.The two types of flying differs in how these 3 big goals are achieved.With VFR you look out the window and see if the horizon is level, and that you are not sinking or ascending to keep level and straight flight. You sometimes crosscheck this with your instruments but the windscreen and your vestibular system is your primary instrument. You avoid flying into things by what is called ‚Äúsee-and-avoid‚Äù, which is exactly what you imagine. You see things and you avoid them. You use your radio to be aware of other airplanes around you, but your primary means of avoiding them is still the fact that you see them and steer away from them. And finally you get to where you want to be by looking out finding landmarks and flying to your destination based on that. For example you might spot a river, or a big road and follow it to your destination. This is what we call visual flight rules, or VFR for short.This is all great and very intuitive. But the problem is that none of this works if you can‚Äôt see out of the airplane! And that happens more often than you would like. Fog and clouds and mist and darkness has caused many accidents before more advanced piloting techniques were developed.So what do we do if we can‚Äôt see? We fly using the instruments in our cockpit, and this process is called instrument flying rules or IFR for short.You keep the airplane straight and level by scanning the instruments and integrating what they say in your head and reacting accordingly. This is harder than it sounds. One tricky thing is that your inner ear in the absence of visual inputs lies to you! You might feel you are ascending when you are actually banking . The other tricky thing is that there is a certain amount of lag on the airplane‚Äôs reaction to your inputs and there are random noises like tiny gusts of wind, so if you yank the controls every time you see the instruments change immediately then you yourself might induce oscillations in the airplane. And then you react to those oscillations and if your reactions are in phase things might get worse and worse. So you have to learn to not do that, and also to trust the instruments more than your own internal sense of orientation. Which is very non intuitive and therefore hard.Then you also have to avoid hitting things. The way you avoid hitting cranes, buildings and terrain is by flying above a certain minimum altitude. As you might guess this minimum is higher where the ground is higher and lower where it is lower. And then you also have to know about tall towers. There are maps which advertise how high you have fly to avoid hitting obstacles at any point. Avoiding other airplanes is harder, so you use the help of the air traffic control. They clear you to fly certain directions at certain elevations and they make sure every airplane they control stays far away from each other.And of course both of these depend on you knowing where you are and where you are heading. Having a map of minimum safe altitudes is nice but if you don‚Äôt know where you are it is near useless. Having clearances is nice, but if you don‚Äôt know which way you are flying they won‚Äôt help you. So you use a compass, and radio navigational instruments to keep track of where you are.This is a lot of hard work and you have to do all of the above and more simultaneously at the same time and without major errors. So if you are not good enough at each of them you might become what is known as ‚Äútask-saturated‚Äù. Too many things to do and keep all in your head. Or if you are not processing all of this in your head fast enough your internal representation of what is going on with the airplane and around the airplane might lag behind reality. This is also known informally as ‚Äúflying behind the airplane‚Äù which is for obvious reasons very dangerous. So IFR is much harder than VFR, but also because it is less about your internal feelings and your ability to look around it is also much easier to simulate in a simulator. This is the reason why it is generally recommended to start with VFR training in a real airplane, while in the later IFR training simulators can play a bigger role. reply spookie 2 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s your opinion on seats with haptic feedback and VR for flight simulators? reply LAC-Tech 4 hours agoparentprevYou mentioned some good and bad things acquired from flight sims. Overall would say you net negative or net positive? reply yurisagalov 7 hours agoprevYes for instrument flying, but I would avoid it for your private pilot&#x27;s license (PPL - first license).Your PPL is mostly about \"feeling\" the airplane and looking outside the window, not inside the plane at your instrument cluster. You&#x27;ll pick up more bad habits than good from flying in a sim for your PPL. It&#x27;s not that these bad habits can&#x27;t be fixed, but it&#x27;ll likely actually _add_ time to fix them.After you have your private license, by all means, use a sim to help you get familiar with an unfamiliar route&#x2F;airport&#x2F;etc. I&#x27;ll often even watch YouTube videos of landings at airports I&#x27;m not familiar with.For your instrument rating a good sim can actually be quite helpful. You&#x27;re exclusively looking inside the plane, setting up radios, approaches, VORs, GPS, etc. Having an intimate familiarity with how your various automations work can help. reply YeahThisIsMe 1 hour agoparentI see a lot of people mentioning \"bad habits\" but nobody saying what they are. Could you elaborate on that? reply Matheus28 24 minutes agorootparentWhen you‚Äôre flying VFR, you need to be able to feel where the plane is going and how your inputs are received. Your eyes should be outside 95% of the time, also because you also need to be looking out for traffic.Using a simulator doesn‚Äôt let you build that feel, so you end up spending a lot of time looking at the instruments. When you step into a real plane that can make things difficult, as you‚Äôre supposed to be able to maintain altitude by just looking outside, etc. reply DennisP 7 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m no expert myself but recently I did see a flight instructor on youtube with the opposite opinion, saying that people with a lot of flight sim experience were his best beginner students, and tended to get their PPL in the fewest hours. reply giantg2 6 hours agorootparentSome anecdata here. I got to fly in a combat sim for few hours and the operators were surprised at some of the things I knew how to do just from playing videogames in the past. I do agree with the grandparent that it won&#x27;t help with feel, but I also think that it will help build a knowledge base that can be a useful starting point. reply kbaker 6 hours agorootparentprevI found X-Plane VR useful for practicing basic traffic pattern work.But it definitely needed to be VR to be helpful, to see your relative position vs the airport and runway, pattern altitude, etc.Did not help with stalls or landings, which are more based on the feel of the aircraft. reply exDM69 3 hours agorootparent> But it definitely needed to be VR to be helpfulHead tracking (like TrackIR) is another option, perhaps even better than VR for flight sims because you can see your hand and your controllers. reply meheleventyone 2 hours agorootparentI‚Äôd disagree having used both there is a step change in perception between TrackIR and VR. It‚Äôs the difference in peering through a window that doesn‚Äôt move 1:1 with your head movements versus sitting in the cockpit. reply sundvor 6 hours agorootparentprevStalls are very easy to feel in DCS World with Simshaker&#x2F;SoundModule, and a couple of under-seat transducers. reply pininja 6 hours agorootparentprevThey‚Äôll have explicit knowledge (what the takeoff speed is and where the speed dial is), but probably lack tacit knowledge (what that speed feels like, or what ground effect feels like). Acquiring a PPL in the fewest hours isn‚Äôt necessarily the best metric if it means they‚Äôre finding shortcuts with their explicit knowledge. reply 2024throwaway 6 hours agorootparent‚ÄúTheir knowledge letting them complete the test earlier is bad‚Äù is an interesting take. reply kayodelycaon 5 hours agorootparentThe problem is theory can be detrimental to real world practice. You may not know how to properly integrate the knowledge you have with what are you trying to learn. reply Aeolun 3 hours agorootparentThen the test is wrong? Regardless of what your strong points are, when you succeed at the test you are a pilot. reply ponector 3 hours agorootparentNot really. Test could be close, bit never replace practical exam.Not related to aviation, bit to everything: to learn something to use and to learn something to pass exams - are two different paths. reply tome 1 hour agorootparentprev\"All tests are wrong, some are useful\"(with apologies to George Box) reply kevingadd 5 hours agorootparentprevBeing able to take shortcuts using your knowledge might lead to not acquiring all the fundamentals you&#x27;d usually pick up along the way. reply ezconnect 3 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s no substitute to real flight hours experience. reply almostnormal 41 minutes agorootparentExcept that not every hour is the same. Flying straight and level following a GPS track with no relevant weather or traffic anywhere near accumulates a different kind of experience than other kinds of situations (bad weather, complex airspace, other traffic, ...).Number of landings is probably more relevant for survival. reply dbt00 4 hours agorootparentprevIf you don&#x27;t understand why that&#x27;s bad, look up the 2009 crash of Air France 447, when a pilot made an error that should have been impossible to make with any kind of flight training and killed 228 people. reply pseudosavant 3 hours agorootparentCertainly, by the time you are piloting for Air France, you&#x27;ll have had so much training and experience that whether you used a flight simulator before getting your first pilot&#x27;s license is irrelevant. reply throwup238 3 hours agorootparentNot to mention that the flight simulators for large passenger aircraft are far more advanced than anything you can buy as a consumer, let alone download to a PC. Their physics simulations are advanced enough to use in crash investigations to simulate possible failure scenarios. Their use in training airline pilots is mandatory, not detrimental.This is what a full motion flight simulator for the aforementioned A330 looks like: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.afgsim.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;A330_CEO_Madrid_-5...It costs at least $1.5 million. It&#x27;s ~150x cheaper than the plane and since zero lives at risk, US airline pilots are required to train emergencies in simulators while being accessed by an examiner every six months (IIRC). reply Aeolun 3 hours agorootparentI‚Äôm fairly certain most of the cost there is in the machinery. The software should be more or less comparable (there‚Äôs no reason for it not to be anyway). reply throwup238 3 hours agorootparent> I‚Äôm fairly certain most of the cost there is in the machinery.Why are you so certain?While the hardware isn&#x27;t exactly cheap, neither is the software. Gathering feedback from a bunch of pilots and incorporating it into the simulator isn&#x27;t cheap. Renting out an A330 and a couple of pilots to run experimental validation isn&#x27;t cheap - it costs >$50k an hour and you&#x27;ll need hundreds if not thousands of hours. Validating each software release isn&#x27;t cheap.*> The software should be more or less comparable (there‚Äôs no reason for it not to be anyway).I&#x27;m working on second hand info but AFAIK it takes over a dozen modern networked server systems to provide the fidelity the simulators need (with multiple GPUs no less). The software isn&#x27;t comparable simply because a consumer machine isn&#x27;t powerful enough to run the real stuff and the quality of the simulators has absolutely sky rocketed in the last 20 years. The&#x27;ve been constantly upgraded to the point that a 747 simulator now costs more than the plane itself. reply matheusmoreira 3 hours agorootparentprevThat pilot pulled back constantly on the stick, costing him speed, eventually stalling the plane. He kept pulling back on the stick as the plane fell like a rock despite maximum thrust. He actually overrode the input of the other pilot that tried to pitch down to regain speed and recover from the stall. By the time the captain showed up and diagnosed the situation, they no longer had the altitude to trade for the necessary speed to recover.Look I&#x27;m no expert but even Ace Combat taught me not to do that. To say nothing of simulators where you actually learn concepts like energy management. Planes are not rockets. reply fouc 2 hours agorootparentWow that&#x27;s a tragic story, and it&#x27;s rather maddening that the junior pilot didn&#x27;t properly hand over the steering when asked to. 3 minutes of bad decision making and panicking.. ouch. reply Aeolun 3 hours agorootparentprevYou can do it if you have enough altitude, speed, and go all the way around.Kind wonder if you could pull that off with a passenger airliner though. replykabes 2 hours agorootparentprevMy PPL instructor said he had to unlearn some bad habits with students that had a lot of sim experience. reply jnsaff2 5 hours agoparentprevI did a lot of flight sims before getting my PPL about 15 years ago and I did not feel that the sim hurt my progress at all.It did not help much either.For me the first real flying was very overwhelming as so many things were happening and had to be taken into account. Luckily my instructor was good and took the load that I didn‚Äôt yet need to handle and then I gradually prioritized and got familiar.As others have pointed out the feel of the plane is just not there in a sim.I‚Äôd even say that things like trim I did not fully understand until in the plane, what a difference it makes and how much less tired you are after. reply lodovic 2 hours agorootparentCompare it to using a driving simulator before taking actual driving lessons. Yes, it might give you a slight edge, but the real thing is so much different and is so immersive that a simulator&#x27;s added value is mostly for experienced users and not so much for beginners. reply Beldin 1 hour agorootparentI realise US driving lessons are rather different from driving lessons around here. Around here, the goal of driving lessons is (basically) to reduce cognitive load so that you can spend attention on what&#x27;s happening outside. A steer, pedals, and stick setup would already help enormously with this. Once the student reaches minimal automation, there&#x27;s no bearing real-world experience though.So, basically, your argument makes a strong case that simulation is excellent for absolute beginners. reply JamilD 44 minutes agoprevProcedures and flows is a big one. It really helps for understanding the \"flow\" of processes and making sure you don&#x27;t spend too much precious time in the cockpit repeating the same things just to try to get in the habit of e.g., the flow of engine start, going through your checklists, doing crosswind corrections, etc.For the feel and the mechanics of flying VFR, there&#x27;s nothing you can do except build that intuition, feel, and muscle memory in the aircraft itself. But I disagree it&#x27;s useless for all aspects of VFR training. reply mmaunder 6 hours agoprevYes. I passed my instrument rating earlier this year by using MSFS and X-plane integrated with PilotEdge and working my way through several I ratings on PE. Lots of additional studying by reading the entire Jepp IR book and using Sheppard for review before the written. Also a ton of flying under foggles practicing everything in the standards and making it second nature. Checkride was gnarly in Kansas noon convection turbulence but passed. Sims with PilotEdge help big time on learning to copy clearance, departure, en route and shooting the many approaches available. Also helps to stay current and to review a challenging approach before doing it for real. And it can somewhat help with G1000 avionics programming but it‚Äôs not exactly the same - more of a general guideline.I‚Äôd avoid Vatsim. Sorry fans. I just don‚Äôt find it‚Äôs up to the same standard in realism and professionalism. Also lots of controllers who don‚Äôt know their stuff.Also avoid getting sucked into the gamer aspect of flight sim. You have to actually be training in real aircraft and studying and supplement with sim.Active pause is great for avionics programming, VOR nav and more.You can do it all with a joystick. Pedals and yoke are pointless because sims can‚Äôt simulate things like turbulence or crosswind landings.An RTX 3xxx GPU is plenty. I used a laptop RTX 4090 and desktop 3 series gpu.Lastly if you actually do an instrument rating, learn how to calm yourself with a slow breath in and a slow breath out and never quit during the checkride, no matter how hard it seems. You are PIC and the DPE is pushing your limits, so assume you‚Äôre alone, breath deep and work the problem. Real life single pilot IMC is intense so this is the way. reply chs20 1 hour agoparentSimulating cross-wind landings doesn&#x27;t sound that hard, why do you think current sims don&#x27;t do it well? reply ipsum2 7 hours agoprevSomeone successfully hijacked, flew, and did a barrel roll on a plane just from learning from video games, though it&#x27;s not clear if it was Microsoft Flight Simulator:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.seattletimes.com&#x2F;seattle-news&#x2F;video-games-pilots...Though there&#x27;s some skepticism here:> Some of Mr. Russell‚Äôs actions, such as knowing to be at a certain elevation to perform certain aerial moves, suggested he may have learned them from a flight simulator, Mr. Todd said.> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs highly improbable, but not impossible, that he never had a lick of flying except other than in a virtual world,‚Äù he said.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;us&#x2F;richard-russell-q400-f... reply DennisP 7 hours agoparentX-Plane has a professional version that&#x27;s used in FAA-certified flight simulators.

Everyone who flies has sufficient knowledge and skills, but many don&#x27;t have good decision-making, particularly under pressure.You&#x27;re likely to learn some bad habits from self-teaching in simulator, but those mostly can be unlearned. The real problem would be having excess confidence. That&#x27;s the #1 killer.Flying a real plane in challenging situations should frankly scare you into being a stickler, and staying well clear of your personal limits.If you want to be a good pilot, start with 10+ hours of glider training and then train on something other than a Cessna high-wing (which takes almost no skill for stall recovery).And for knowledge, learn the fundamentals from the FAA books (not the internet or experience in a simulator). reply yetanotherloss 1 hour agoparentGliders or ultralights are a great way to get your head around the way the aircraft moves and what you feel when it does.Being a stickler is one of those cultural things that never makes it into the entertainment world.

To the point where I‚Äôll happily call BS. Taxiing and flying a real plane is substantially different from flying MS flight sim. The physical responses of the plane to control inputs, thrust, and external forces can only be approximated by an actual physical simulator, not a desktop video game.There are other problems with the narrative, too. Instructors will generally get a much better idea of where the student is in their training and brief them pre-flight on the maneuvers to be practiced during the training flight. The instructor would have reviewed the trainee‚Äôs logbook, which should contain notes from prior training flights as well. Unless this instructor was exceptionally careless, he‚Äôd have discovered the commenter‚Äôs inexperience pre-flight. Also, the abnormal attitude&#x2F;configuration the instructor put the plane in and the recovery described sounds dangerously close to a spin. It‚Äôs unlikely an instructor would choose this as the first hooded maneuver for a new instrument rating trainee. reply pc86 6 hours agorootparentprevAlmost as unbelievable as a CFII confusing someone who had never stepped foot in a small plane before with someone going for an instrument rating? reply jcrites 6 hours agorootparentYeah, it‚Äôs a cool story but not really believable.* A student in an instrument flight is doing 99.9% of the work. The instructor is really there as a guide. The instructor will expect a student to do almost everything, from taxiing the plane, to taking off, to the radios. There‚Äôs no way that the instructor will pilot the plane into the air for the student.Even PPL students on their very first lesson can taxi the airplane and be guided through takeoff. Why would an instrument student sit passively by?* Any instructor worth their salt would review the student‚Äôs logbook, and his would‚Äôve been empty or he wouldn‚Äôt even have one. I can‚Äôt see this happening even as the result of some kind of massive mixup.* An instructor meeting a new student for the first time, for instrument flight, and instructor doesn‚Äôt even ask how many flight hours the student has? What training or experience they have? I‚Äôve trained with a number of instructors, and none has taken me in an airplane without asking these kind of basic questions.Flying in a simulator also doesn‚Äôt generally prepare you for the preflight (walk-around). Anyone going for their instrument rating would know how to do this solo ‚Äî and the instructor would expect the student to do it most likely (maybe not for instrument lessons?) ‚Äî whereas someone who hasn‚Äôt stepped foot in a plane wouldn‚Äôt know how to do it at all. Are you really going to know how to check fuel levels and oil levels from the simulator? I doubt it.(There are some highly realistic simulator mods that get close though, and can simulate the preflight too.)* The original story does not use accurate terminology. (A CFII that I asked about this story wrote: ‚ÄúWhen you give the controls to a student you don‚Äôt let them aimlessly wonder under the hood you give a radial to follow or some nav aid - no one aimlessly wanders for instrument training. Dude doesn‚Äôt know basic terminology either: Anyone worth two cents would say pull the throttle, rolled out of the bank stepped on the rudder to remove the yaw.‚Äù)I‚Äôve taken flight lessons but don‚Äôt have a PPL.

I could see that I was in a dive with rotation so I cut the throttle, centered the stick and kicked opposite rudder until the rotation stopped then regained level flight.That is a weird way of explaining what happened and I find it extremely hard to believe this was written by a pilot. I would have never used the word rotation and dive. They mean very different things from what the author is trying to explain. If I was writing this, I would have said, \"I was put in a spin and I did blah to recover\". Also, there is a very important piece of PARE missing in that commentary, the \"P\".

However, I am learning guitar and I&#x27;ve discovered there&#x27;s a whole range of games that are designed to teach you to play guitar. I&#x27;m currently working my way through one called Yousician which also does ukulele, bass guitar, and I think singing and piano too.Rockstar is another one, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work well with a classical guitar while Yousician seems to be amazingly good at hearing the notes I play.It&#x27;s not a complete guitar teaching tool - it doesn&#x27;t replace simply practicing songs by myself without looking at a screen, which is probably the most important type of practice for any instrument. It also doesn&#x27;t teach that much music theory, although it does cover the basic better than I expected. But it does one thing amazingly well. It motivates me to practice, especially at the beginner level where I&#x27;m not making any particularly nice music, and it&#x27;s teaching me a lot of the basic coordination and muscle memory while doing so. It also provides carefully curated challenge levels, which I can pick from depending on my current learning level and, just as important, how I&#x27;m feeling at that moment.I think flight sims would be similar. They can&#x27;t replace the genuine experience of flying a plane, of course. But we human learn well in a multi-modal manner. We can memorize a route by flying over a virtual map. We can memorize steps to land a plane, or to take off, in a game, even if they are not complete, and then apply what we&#x27;ve learned to learn the real thing quickly in an actual plane.My experience over the last few weeks with Yousician has made me far more interested in the idea of gamified learning.

Your primary reference is to everything outside of you. You will check your instruments, but 95% of the time, you&#x27;ll be looking outside. At least in the US, you usually aren&#x27;t under ATC direction.

If you pay for game pass its included. reply jillesvangurp 3 hours agoprevI think the reality is that the type of people interested in flying will have spent a lot of time in simulators already by the time they start taking lessons and it really helps. You&#x27;ll already know what each instrument is, how to read it, in what order to do things, running check-lists, how to start the plane, taxi, navigate, etc. You&#x27;ll probably be a bit clumsy at the controls and be too focused inside the cockpit instead of outside. But that&#x27;s something that can be corrected in your first few lessons. And btw. focusing on your instruments is something you shouldn&#x27;t be doing in the sim either; all the visual queues are there to fly proper vfr. MS Flight simulator has lots of pretty scenery, which you can use to fly VFR and learn how to navigate by landmarks. If anything, it&#x27;s a little too pretty. Real life visibility is a lot more tricky. I fly x-plane myself and while less pretty, the flight model is awesome and it models the lack of visibility pretty well. And with some add-ons the scenery isn&#x27;t that bad.And if you are flying IFR, it&#x27;s actually the opposite: you shouldn&#x27;t look outside (typically not a lot to see there anyway) and you can&#x27;t trust your senses. A lot of learning to fly is basically absorbing a lot of theory and knowledge. You don&#x27;t need a plane for that and simulators are great for putting all that to the test.In any case, flight simulators are used a lot by actual pilots as well for practicing procedures, instrument approaches, etc. The backstory of X-Plane is actually that the person that created it (Austin Meyer) was struggling with getting their instrument rating and developed it initially as a way to help practice that. That was more than thirty years ago.These days sims are a lot better and both MS FS and X-Plane are very usable for learning all sorts of things about flying. The trick with both is to stop treating them like games and start treating them like the real thing. It&#x27;s not perfect obviously but the planes will roughly do similar things under the same circumstances. If you fly by the numbers (speeds, altitudes, etc.), things like landings get a lot easier. You&#x27;ll get a lot of the same visual queues as in a real plane (too high, too low, etc.). X-plane is actually sold for commercial usage where real pilots log real hours that actually count to their ratings. The difference with the regular version is a USB-key that locks down some of the settings and a lot of hardware that you can buy yourself as well. reply kabes 2 hours agoprevI have a PPL and I recently tested some simulators and I find them way more difficult than actual flying, because there&#x27;s no sense of distance and no motion.

Now the new approach is‚Ä¶ what exactly? Write software aimed at a minority of activists who pass its purity test?

How is iCloud privacy violating? reply hedora 13 hours agorootparentFrom reading the bug, they don‚Äôt support iCloud backup, which is surprising to me, since I thought supporting backup was trivial on iOS.As the bug points out, they could use core data sync for people that are navigating using multiple devices.I believe all of the above supports transparent E2E encryption at this point.(For backup, there is a toggle, since E2E makes your backup useless if you lose the only device that contains your keys, and many people only have one apple device, and don‚Äôt want to bother enlisting their friends to secret-share their recovery key). reply gitinit 14 hours agoparentprevIf I remember correctly, you can export bookmarks to a file, though this definitely doesn&#x27;t replace proper synchronization. reply hdjrbrbn 12 hours agoparentprevThe whole offline first thing is the feature here.

But even then it can be sparse (eg just visited Merida, Bacalar and Valladolid in Mexico), and it‚Äôs worse in ‚Äúnon-western‚Äù countriesTellingly, Overture Maps that use OSM for the street data to not use the POI data.A lot of people pointed out that the POI data of Overture had mediocre quality. While that is true, they do at least have coverage in places OSM do not. If you know the name of the place you can at least find itI‚Äôm not sure how this can become better, I‚Äôd think that a prerequisite would be that corporate users like Grab, DiDi, Uber start contributingBut that may not happen as they are not allowed to combine datasets [1]. Hence you have a chicken and egg problem: The dataset is not usable until it is complete‚Ä¶The street data fundementally have the same problem, but that is easier to edit remotely and may be more stable in contrast to POIsSo I‚Äôm starting to question if it‚Äôs really worth it to continue update POIs in OSM, but I also would not know how to contribute to Overture as it does have quite some errors :)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OvertureMaps&#x2F;data&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;102edit: Or maybe it is possible to conflate them, but that is not planned - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;OvertureMaps&#x2F;data&#x2F;issues&#x2F;96 reply szszrk 13 hours agoparentWhat do you think about Street Complete [0][1][2]? I know it doesn&#x27;t let you provide all and any data, but I find it super friendly.It lets you add details to objects that already exist in OSM. It looks very polished, has nice map, icons, and this default style of sticking to your actual location like some location based games for crazy people (I&#x27;m a former Ingress player, Enlightened FTW).My neighborhood has all details about building size, roofs, street lights, you know if there are markings on the ground on street crossings (for people with poor vision), each path has clear info of what&#x27;s it&#x27;s made of, and stores has open&#x2F;close hours provided.

But if you are already an experienced OSM editor, you likely have developed muscle-memory in Vespucci or EveryDoor that lets you quickly add additional tags while barely looking at the screen.Also, as I mentioned in my other post, adding POIs and additional tags in some regions‚Äô urban areas is difficult because you don‚Äôt want to walk around with your phone out. And the USA makes it challenging to add and update POIs because you often can‚Äôt just walk down a street, the sprawl sets everything too far apart for that. The existing mobile editing apps, alas, cannot make up for political failures. reply matkoniecz 13 hours agorootparentprev> I know it doesn&#x27;t let you provide all and any data, but I find it super friendly.But shops can be added (using shop overlay).(I am one of people developing StreetComplete) reply JeremyNT 10 hours agorootparentI adore this app and it makes it even more fun to wander around new areas on foot.One thing I ran into is that there are buildings that aren&#x27;t shown in Street Complete.

I don&#x27;t know if this is seen as wanted in the OSM community, it might attract a lot of low-effort contributions which might wear out longtime volunteers.The way I started contributing to OSM is when I was tired of seeing old or no POI data and thought \"enough is enough\". I first started editing the shopping mall in my neighbourhood, then the schools, and so forth. It is now 5 years later and I can quite keep up locally with POI. reply eisa01 15 hours agorootparentSame, 95% of my edits are POI data in the past two years and I fixed two of the main shipping streets in my neighborhoodBut yeah, not sure how scalable even such a campaign would be. I‚Äôm the only user I know that use EveryDoor to confirm&#x2F;update POI in a city of 500k people‚Ä¶You‚Äôd probably need at least 1 out of 1000 people globally to actively contribute. That‚Äôs almost 10 million people, quite a bit more than the 1 million Organic Maps users and 250k OSM contributors in 2022 :) reply matkoniecz 12 hours agorootparentprevlocal mappers interested in mapping their area are highly welcome!if anyone here is interested and unsure how to start, feel free to ask at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;community.openstreetmap.org&#x2F; (official forum, requires OSM account) or at one of other contact channels ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Contact_channels ) - there is Slack, IRC, Discord and so on.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.openstreetmap.org&#x2F; may help but it is sadly suboptimal for someone completely new.If you just click edit you will get tutorial for default in-browser editor. reply NewsyHacker 14 hours agoparentprevIn my OSM career, bike-traveling the world, I have added POIs in all kinds of unlikely places in the developing world. But a real challenge is adding more than just the indication that there is, for example, a shop there. It‚Äôs hard to add a name= tag when the shop has not hung up a sign with a name. It‚Äôs hard to add an opening_hours= tag when the shop has not posted opening hours, and even if I ask the owners, they might say hours are totally fuzzy. Such clear information is largely a feature of the developed world.In some parts of urban Latin America, the challenge in adding POIs is that it is ill-advised to slowly, aimlessly walk down the street with your phone, because it could get snatched. reply Reason077 14 hours agorootparent> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to add a name= tag when the shop has not hung up a sign with a name. It‚Äôs hard to add an opening_hours= tag when the shop has not posted opening hours‚ÄùEven Google Maps has this problem. There‚Äôs a lot of ‚Äúgreat noodle shop second on left‚Äù type business names in some parts of the world. Owners often live above&#x2F;behind&#x2F;in the shop&#x2F;restaurant and they open more or less on demand. Hours will change seasonally - if there‚Äôs customers they‚Äôre open and if there isn‚Äôt they close.The real trick with POI data is not just the data itself but the metadata that tells you how important it is. If you know how many people are searching for a place, visiting a place, reviewing it etc then you can boost its prominence in map rendering and search results, greatly improving UX.An ideal solution would be for all the travel, mapping apps, etc that compete against Google (TripAdvisor, Yelp, Apple Maps, Facebook, all the in-car apps, etc) to share some kind of global OpenPOI database on top of OSM that aggregates reviews, photos, metadata, etc. And also gives owners a single source of truth to update their business data, keep it updated in real time, and have it disseminated everywhere‚Ä¶ reply Rygian 15 hours agoparentprev> So I‚Äôm starting to question if it‚Äôs really worth it to continue update POIs in OSM, but I also would not know how to contribute to Overture as it does have quite some errors :)It&#x27;s not a chicken-and-egg situation.

I got burned pretty hard in the Alps by OSM when a trail didn&#x27;t actually exist. Since then, I like to use Organic Maps for a digital \"reconnaissance\" of OSM points of interest and then a country-specific topo map like USGS or IGN for backcountry navigation or route finding.Note: AlpineQuest is a great app for this and is one of the few apps that doesn&#x27;t charge a subscription to access our taxpayer-funded maps. reply tomato-sauce 12 hours agorootparentI had a similar experience using Organic Maps for hiking. I was hiking on a forested hill near an urban center. Both Google and Apple Maps only had a couple of the biggest trails while organic maps showed an extensive network. This was really helpful for exploring but I ended up having to take a pretty long detour to get back since the trail I had planned to take didn‚Äôt exist. I also encountered a trail marked on the map that had obviously been closed for years and was extremely overgrown.

Canopy of D. aromatica at the Forest Research Institute Malaysia displaying crown shyness Trees at Plaza San Mart√≠n (Buenos Aires), Argentina Crown shyness (also canopy disengagement,[1] canopy shyness,[2] or inter-crown spacing[3]) is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.[4][5] This is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.[6][7] There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.[8] Possible physiological explanations[edit] The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.[6] It has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.[9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of convergent evolution.[citation needed] Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to \"reciprocal pruning\" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during winds. The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.[10] If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.[11] This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.[6][12] According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness. Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in eucalyptus in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.[13] Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of Picea sitchensis (Sitka spruce) and Larix kaempferi (Japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading shoots.[14][15] A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.[16] Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a task widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the phytochrome photoreceptors.[17] Many species of plant respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.[18] Similarly, plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants,[19] though this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.[20] The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses.[6][21] Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied Dryobalanops aromatica, suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.[6][21] A 2015 study has suggested that Arabidopsis thaliana shows different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to be contingent on the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.[22] A 1998 study proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,[6][21] though a causal link between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be experimentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing that are only exhibited between conspecifics.[6][7] Species[edit] Trees that display crown shyness patterns include: Species of Dryobalanops, including Dryobalanops lanceolata[23] and Dryobalanops aromatica (kapur) Some species of eucalypt[24] Pinus contorta or lodgepole pine[1] Avicennia germinans or black mangrove[3] Schefflera pittieri[6][12] Clusia alata[6][12] K.

The most interesting ones are that there is a positive correlation between crown shyness and tree slenderness [1] and between crown shyness and leaf shape [2].The former is especially interesting because it implies that crown shyness is an explicit strategy for resource management beyond just responding to the availability of light, since it presumably also improves the survivability of the species. The latter is interesting because it might be an adaptation to other environmental stresses like wind damage.As always, more questions than answers :-)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;33713413&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;144... reply qp11 5 hours agoparentJust wondering...what percentage of trees display this behavior? I have never seen this in my neck of the woods. reply throwup238 4 hours agorootparentThe best estimate I can give you is \"not many\" but it hasn&#x27;t been exhaustively studied, especially with tens of thousands of tree species. I would like to point out though that crown shyness is a lot easier to observe in monoculture forests that were replanted after logging. A diverse forest with lots of trees is really hard to observe tree shyness in because it&#x27;s a specific adaptation between members of one or a few species. If they&#x27;re standing next to another species that doesn&#x27;t cooperate, the shyness might not be readily visible.It&#x27;s also not universal, which is why it&#x27;s increasingly believed to be some sort of stress response. One patch of trees in a forest may exhibit it while another patch of the exact same species a few hundred feet away might not. It might even be the case that this is an old adaptation that most trees are capable of but no longer need. reply thriftwy 18 minutes agorootparentMy experience with winter forests is that almost all trees display shyness when without leaves. reply qp11 3 hours agorootparentprevMakes sense. Thanks! reply spiritplumber 22 minutes agoprevLooks like it&#x27;s a case of \"leaves have evolved to not mess with each other intra-tree\" and the environmental data used for it is broad enough that it also works inter-tree. reply ninkendo 7 hours agoprevThe way I‚Äôve always imagined crown shyness (from a total less-than-layman perspective where I‚Äôve only casually read about the topic) is from a game theory&#x2F;selfish gene perspective. Trees of the same species will share a lot of the same genes, and genes that code for non-shyness will grow to the detriment of the trees around them. Trees which critically are very likely to share a lot of the same genes. So that non-shyness gene will lose out in the long run against genes that code for shyness.It‚Äôs similar to the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma, with shyness being ‚Äúcooperate‚Äù and non-shyness being ‚Äúdefect‚Äù. Groups of trees with cooperative strategies would do better collectively (and win out), even if a non-cooperative individual can beat a cooperative individual every time.Veritasium had a great video on this very topic today, in fact: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;mScpHTIi-kM reply schneems 4 hours agoparentIn ‚Äúthe hidden life of trees‚Äù the author talks about forests being stronger than individual trees. Which I believe agrees with your conclusion.As a tree you don‚Äôt want to get dwarfed, starved and die. But you also don‚Äôt want to kill your neighbors either since they could be providing a wind break and helping you survive. Essentially their evolution has taught them that sharing, within reason, is an optimal strategy than pure greed.The book goes into much more detail.

    "originBody": "Bayesians moving from defense to offense: ‚ÄúI really think it‚Äôs kind of irresponsible now not to use the information from all those thousands of medical trials that came before. Is that very radical?‚Äù Posted on December 23, 2023 9:45 AM by Andrew Erik van Zwet, Sander Greenland, Guido Imbens, Simon Schwab, Steve Goodman, and I write: We have examined the primary efficacy results of 23,551 randomized clinical trials from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We estimate that the great majority of trials have much lower statistical power for actual effects than the 80 or 90% for the stated effect sizes. Consequently, ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù estimates tend to seriously overestimate actual treatment effects, ‚Äúnonsignificant‚Äù results often correspond to important effects, and efforts to replicate often fail to achieve ‚Äúsignificance‚Äù and may even appear to contradict initial results. To address these issues, we reinterpret the P value in terms of a reference population of studies that are, or could have been, in the Cochrane Database. This leads to an empirical guide for the interpretation of an observed P value from a ‚Äútypical‚Äù clinical trial in terms of the degree of overestimation of the reported effect, the probability of the effect‚Äôs sign being wrong, and the predictive power of the trial. Such an interpretation provides additional insight about the effect under study and can guard medical researchers against naive interpretations of the P value and overoptimistic effect sizes. Because many research fields suffer from low power, our results are also relevant outside the medical domain. Also this new paper from Zwet with Lu Tian and Rob Tibshirani: Evaluating a shrinkage estimator for the treatment effect in clinical trials The main objective of most clinical trials is to estimate the effect of some treatment compared to a control condition. We define the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the ratio of the true treatment effect to the SE of its estimate. In a previous publication in this journal, we estimated the distribution of the SNR among the clinical trials in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We found that the SNR is often low, which implies that the power against the true effect is also low in many trials. Here we use the fact that the CDSR is a collection of meta-analyses to quantitatively assess the consequences. Among trials that have reached statistical significance we find considerable overoptimism of the usual unbiased estimator and under-coverage of the associated confidence interval. Previously, we have proposed a novel shrinkage estimator to address this ‚Äúwinner‚Äôs curse.‚Äù We compare the performance of our shrinkage estimator to the usual unbiased estimator in terms of the root mean squared error, the coverage and the bias of the magnitude. We find superior performance of the shrinkage estimator both conditionally and unconditionally on statistical significance. Let me just repeat that last sentence: We find superior performance of the shrinkage estimator both conditionally and unconditionally on statistical significance. From a Bayesian standpoint, this is no surprise. Bayes is optimal if you average over the prior distribution and can be reasonable if averaging over something close to the prior. Especially reasonable in comparison to naive unregularized estimates (as here). Erik summarizes: We‚Äôve determined how much we gain (on average over the Cochrane Database) by using our shrinkage estimator. It turns out to be about a factor 2 more efficient (in terms of the MSE) than the unbiased estimator. That‚Äôs roughly like doubling the sample size! We‚Äôre using similar methods as our forthcoming paper about meta-analysis with a single trial. People sometimes ask me how I‚Äôve changed as a statistician over the years. One answer I‚Äôve given is that I‚Äôve gradually become more Bayesian. I started out as a skeptic, concerned about Bayesian methods at all; then in grad school I started using Bayesian statistics in applications and realizing it could solve some problems for me; when writing BDA and ARM, still having the Bayesian cringe and using flat priors as much as possible, or not talking about priors at all; then with Aleks, Sophia, and others moving toward weakly informative priors; eventually under the influence of Erik and others trying to use direct prior information. At this point I‚Äôve pretty much gone full Lindley. Just as a comparison to where my colleagues and I are now, check out my response in 2008 to a question from Sanjay Kaul about how to specify a prior distribution for a clinical trial. I wrote: I suppose the best prior distribution would be based on a multilevel model (whether implicit or explicit) based on other, similar experiments. A noninformative prior could be ok but I prefer something weakly informative to avoid your inferences being unduly affected by extremely unrealistic possibilities in the tail of the distribuiton. Nothing wrong with this advice, exactly, but I was still leaning in the direction of noninformativeness in a way that I would not anymore. Sander Greenland replied at the time with a recommendation to use direct prior information. (And, just for fun, here‚Äôs a discussion from 2014 on a topic where Sander and I disagree.) Erik concludes: I really think it‚Äôs kind of irresponsible now not to use the information from all those thousands of medical trials that came before. Is that very radical? That last question reminds me of our paper from 2008, Bayes: Radical, Liberal, or Conservative? P.S. Also this: You can click through to see the whole story.

So far I&#x27;ve never seen e.g. b being sampled from Normal(mu=2, sigma=1) instead of just setting b=2.- The frequentist assumption of a true population value which we try to estimate just makes sense to me. For example there is a true mean income over the working population. It&#x27;s not a random variable but a fixed value which can be computed if we just asked every single working person for their income and then compute the mean over all values.I tried getting into Bayesian stats but honestly it just seems overkill for most cases. For a simple regression computing b_hat = inv(XX&#x27;)Y is just faster and easier than numerically sampling traces. Bayesian forces you to think about the data generating process - I appreciate that, but you need to the same when it comes to frequentist stats, it&#x27;s just a little less obvious. reply enriquto 9 hours agoparent> When sample size grows, frequentist and bayesian [...] estimates seem to converge to each other anywayYes.

Bayesians would argue (and I quote) that \"the interesting limit in statistics is when the number of samples tends to one.

The prior dominates, which is a bad thing. reply nextos 7 hours agoparentprevBayesian statistics, the way Andrew Gelman practices it, comes naturally when you are interested in generative models of data. You can still use maximum likelihood estimates, but these become fragile when you have hierarchical &#x2F; multilevel models.Multilevel models are fantastic to address a problem that is often ignored by frequentist approaches, the need for shrinkage and information sharing. This pops up all the time in modern statistics. For example, if you test 1000 hypotheses, calculating p-values and adjusting these with some multiplicity correction scheme is not sufficient.You should borrow information across random variables with a multilevel model to avoid estimating exaggerated effects in tests whose outcome is deemed to be significant. Andrew Gelman&#x27;s post is concerned with this topic.Another point is that Gelman et al. use weakly informative hyperpriors. These are not really subjective. If anything, they usually regularize solutions by pushing effects towards zero. Plus, on multilevel models, priors are only needed on hyperparameters. reply SubiculumCode 4 hours agorootparentI use mixed level models for longitudinal analysis pretty regularly. There the point has been to account for correlated dependent observations (e.g. repeated variables within a participant.However it seems that you are suggesting another use. If I have 10 cognitive measures each measured once in my subjectd, the default has been to do a multiple comparison correction, either FDR or FWER on 10 tests. We know that the 10 tests are not truly independent, so Bonferroni is probably too conservative.It seems here you suggest running this with test being a random effect. I&#x27;ve seen this approach with item level data in a task, but I didn&#x27;t really think to do it when the tests are not from the same battery, construct. And more to the point, this fixed effect model would be of no particular interest, while random effect CIs are difficult to estimate. So I am left a bit confused. reply nextos 4 hours agorootparentI am referring to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Stein%27s_example.

Frequentist stats just works and easily interpretable but easy to make mistakes esp. when starting out. reply KRAKRISMOTT 8 hours agoparentprevThe Bayesian formula is dreadfully useful in machine learning, in the modeling of generative problems. However because integration (in calculus) is computationally intractable, we usually have to use approximations instead of true bayesian stats. reply clircle 8 hours agoparentprev> Interestingly, when I see Bayesians simulate random data (to introduce the concepts on this data) they usually assume a true parameter value.

It&#x27;s kinda nice that it kinda extends and translates occams razors into numbers.Yes frequentist statistics work very well in practice, but it&#x27;s a bit adhoc and suffers from various problems like say if you estimate velocity and estimate kinetic energy, you get values that are incompatible which is kinda ugly and non-intuitive and makes you want to dig deeper into how such a thing happened.Bayesianism has the answers.Also sometimes it really does matter like in medicine, where some conditions have a very low prior probability. reply jgalt212 8 hours agorootparent> but it&#x27;s a bit adhocThat&#x27;s how many people feel about Bayesian methods when trying to pick an initial prior. reply im3w1l 7 hours agorootparentI mean that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so good about them. The prior is a bit arbitrary and up for discussion.

The \"problems\" with algorithmic probability (uncomputability, UTM \"choice\" etc.) seem to be \"the dog ate my homework\" excuses. No scientific model is required to prove itself to be the best of all possible models relative to a given set of observations in order to be considered the best current model relative to those observations. No \"UTM\" chosen on the basis of the observations to be modeled is reasonably considered anything but post-hoc theorizing. reply jmuncaster 8 hours agoprevBernoulli‚Äôs Fallacy by Aubrey Clayton is a good treatment of this subject and where frequentist statistics fails. reply mjfl 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve never heard anyone promote frequentist statistics.

To be clear I am someone who doesn&#x27;t really understand the faultlines. reply travisjungroth 16 hours agoparentFrequentist is the default. People don‚Äôt promote it. They just teach it as statistics, use p-values, and look funny at anyone who does otherwise.It‚Äôs like how you wouldn‚Äôt hear people in the US promote imperial measurements for home baking. When you dominate, you don‚Äôt have to advocate. reply analog31 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d identify a larger problem, which is teaching anything as a bunch of recipes.My college offered stats in two tracks: There was a one-semester course for science majors, which was mostly plugging numbers into formulas. The course was utterly baffling for most of the students who took it.There was also a two-semester course for math majors. It was mainly about proofs, but also had time to go into more depth. You have to know the assumptions underlying a formula, if you&#x27;re expected to prove it. ;-) But it was only taken by the math majors. reply dan-robertson 10 hours agorootparentI‚Äôm not sure that teaching mathstats more broadly is the answer to frequentist approaches being used by default, or to the recipe problem. I did the whole mathstats thing as a student and spent a bunch of time doing calculus around things like maximum likelihood estimators or unbiased estimators. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very useful for the application of statistics in practice. I would recommend Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath as a course in Bayesian statistics targeted at scientists who want to extract correct, useful conclusions from their experiments, which doesn‚Äôt follow the ‚Äúrecipe book‚Äù pattern. reply analog31 8 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure of that either. For one thing, the students would be blown away.One thing we didn&#x27;t have when I took stats was computers. I graduated from high school in 1982, and the colleges in my state were just beginning to get computers. I wonder if stats could be approached differently if it could start with nothing but data -- lots of it -- and graphing tools. This could even happen pre-college. reply mjfl 14 hours agorootparentprevBut I don&#x27;t see p-values as connected to frequentist statistics. Rather, p-values are a concept that applies to the problem of hypothesis testing, which both frequentist and bayesian statistics should apply to, right? And in both cases you would use a p-value. The unique thing that Bayesian statistics can do is fit parameters can calculate uncertainty in those parameters, which does not contradict any of the concepts of hypothesis testing. reply PheonixPharts 12 hours agorootparent> But I don&#x27;t see p-values as connected to frequentist statistics.P-values are fundamentally Frequentist because this framework see that observed data as random, whereas Bayesian statistics believe our observations are the only thing that is actually known, and all the other parameters are what is random in our experiments. That is: the data is the only part of an experiment that is real, everything else that we can&#x27;t directly observe is something we must hypothesize about. reply travisjungroth 14 hours agorootparentprevA p-value is the frequency you‚Äôd expect to see a sample with an effect this size or greater, given the null hypothesis. It‚Äôs inherently a frequentist approach to inference.You can squish it into Bayes by considering it a uniform prior on the real number line that you never update, but you‚Äôre not really doing things ‚Äúin the spirit‚Äù of Bayes, then. reply mjfl 13 hours agorootparentWhat is a ‚Äúprior‚Äù in the context of hypothesis testing? That seems to me to be a concept used in parameter estimation, with Bayes rule. But hypothesis testing is not parameter estimation. reply PheonixPharts 12 hours agorootparentIn Bayesian terms there is no distinction between hypothesis testing and parameter estimation.If your hypothesis is that A is greater than B, then you&#x27;re test boils down to \"The probability that A is greater than B\", which is arrived at through parameter estimation via Bayes&#x27; Theorem.You can consider the distribution of estimates for a parameter to represent a space of possible hypothesis for the true value of that parameter and their absolutely or relative likelihood based on the information available.The also has the pleasant consequence that hypothesis testing using Bayesian methods nearly always is closer to the actual question someone wants to answer rather than replying with confusing statements such as \"the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis\", which contains an implicit double negative. reply mjfl 6 hours agorootparent> If your hypothesis is that A is greater than B, then you&#x27;re test boils down to \"The probability that A is greater than B\", which is arrived at through parameter estimation via Bayes&#x27; Theorem.but even in this situation you would need a threshold for decision making, i.e. a p-value. reply uoaei 5 hours agorootparent\"p-value\" as a term already has a definition -- one that imposes a frequentist perspective -- so you&#x27;d have to come up with a new term to define a Bayesian analogue of that concept. reply mjfl 4 hours agorootparentI fail to understand why the terminology matters. If you need to make a decision then there will be a threshold in the probability that will determine it. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you call it p values or anything else. reply uoaei 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not understanding your confusion. Different concepts require different words to distinguish them in conversation. p-value is a name, not merely a descriptor, of one possible way to define a threshold.

We should be quantifying the comparison of the null versus alternative hypotheses. People already compare them. Might as well bring some math into it. reply mitthrowaway2 12 hours agorootparentprevHow is hypothesis testing different from parameter estimation? They seem conceptually the same to me, with one a special case of the other. reply stale2002 10 hours agorootparentprev> What is a ‚Äúprior‚Äù in the context of hypothesis testing?A prior could be any previous knowledge that you have on the subject, or anything about the world.Let me give you a silly example. Imagine I do an experiment, on if person A can see the future, and predict coin flips.Now, imagine that I do this experiment, and lo and behold it passes the 5% threshold P value!Remember what a P value is. It is simply the percent chance that the results that you got were by chance.So, if I do that experiment, and it actually gets at the \"P value\" of 5%, which means that there is a 5% chance of it happening by chance, do you know believe that Person A can see the future?I wouldn&#x27;t. I would need a much lower P value to start believing that.Thats all a prior is. It is using the fact that \"Person A can see the future!\" is an extraordinary claim. And for that, we require extraordinary evidence. Much better evidence than a mere \"5% that it happened by chance\". P reply tingletech 12 hours agorootparentprevI think with a Bayesian test one would use credible intervals rather than p values? reply zozbot234 16 hours agoparentprevFrequentist statistics is largely based on the maximum likelihood principle, which is a proper Bayesian analysis whenever the prior is a flat distribution. And since inference is mostly done on model parameters in frequentist statistics, the distribution you assume for them will also depend on how you parameterize the model. So it can often be justified as a convenient approximation to a \"properly\" Bayesian result. reply jdewerd 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve probably heard 1000 Bayesians rant about the alleged Frequentist consensus and 0 Frequentists complain about Bayesian analysis.

There&#x27;s most likely a way to rephrase your favorite Bayesian analysis so as to make it fully kosher from a \"robust+frequentist\" point of view, even keeping the math unchanged. It just goes to show how silly the \"controversy\" is. reply PheonixPharts 12 hours agorootparentprevBayesian statistics is fundamentally less complicated than Frequentist statistics since everything can be derived from a very simple set of first principles, rather than complex frameworks of ad hoc testing methodologies. reply throwawaymaths 15 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s always room for a first time.Bayesian statistics is sound but I suspect it&#x27;s often just used to justify biases. It is technically valid to use a prior and de facto never update it, because you know I&#x27;ll get around to updating my prior next week, or... eventually, cough cough let&#x27;s be honest, never reply marcosdumay 13 hours agorootparentBayesian statistics is the one where you must state your bias explicitly, and justify them one by one under the light.It&#x27;s the frequentist one that gets your biases implicitly, on the form of corrections and hypothesis formulation, so that people don&#x27;t notice them. reply derbOac 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve published Bayesian methodology papers and reviewed them and although I might call myself an objective Bayesianist maybe, Bayesianism has its own implicit biases. In the very least, I think it can take advantage of implicit biases people have in interpreting analyses.One issue is that Bayes estimates are almost always produced, even if no information is coming from empirical data, and all the information is coming from a prior. So it&#x27;s possible to produce results heavily influenced by the prior with Bayesian estimation that with frequentist methods would fail completely because of lack of identification of the model, sending a strong signal that something is wrong. This can all be sussed out with Bayesian methods but people often don&#x27;t do it.Another more subtle issue is people aren&#x27;t quite aware of how a prior can deviate from \"maximal conservativism\". Sometimes, for example, depending on the model, a very flat prior is actually not conservative, and is overweighting tails.There&#x27;s other examples too. Basically, yes, Bayesianism forces you to be explicit with your biases, but people are really bad at interpreting the actual impact of those biases in a formal Bayesian framework, or at least, aren&#x27;t any better at it than with frequentist methods that are available.If you approach statistical inference from the perspective of accuracy (as the linked paper seems to do) Bayesianism is better to the extent the priors are accurate. This is true a lot of the time empirically, but it does lead to a kind of tautology, in that you&#x27;re doing the analysis because you don&#x27;t really know what \"truth\" is. So if you&#x27;re right in your priors, Bayesianism is accurate, but then you didn&#x27;t really need new data as much in the first place; if you&#x27;re wrong, it&#x27;s more biased. Basically in the bias-variance tradeoff, Bayesianism makes a bet on reduced variance assuming that the resulting bias will be small enough.Philosophically, though, there&#x27;s a completely different argument, which is one of competitive fairness. You might say this doesn&#x27;t matter, but consider consequential decisions, like hiring or admissions decisions: if someone was making a prediction about you, would you want them to use a strong prior, or something that&#x27;s maximally conservative and fair?This philosophy leads to frequentism basically.My preference is to be maximally conservative in a Bayesian framework, which leads to reference priors, which are often flat in many canonical situations, which is basically frequentism. In other situations you might have a different kind of prior.To me the linked paper is pretty interesting and makes a good point. On the other hand, I&#x27;d rather not make any assumptions about a new result based on past studies on other effects. I&#x27;d rather just collect lots of diverse real data and meta-analyze it.

A frequentist approach assumes a random (or noisy) underlying process and characterizes its probability. A Bayesian approach assumes a fixed but unknown process and updates the probability a given model matches that reality.It is ultimately the same math, if you are comparing apples to apples. Just different ways of looking at a problem. Sometimes one is better suited than the other.It‚Äôs like as if physicists were arguing over whether Cartesian or Polar coordinates were better.

Instead, sensationalism about miniscule effects that vanish on replication attempts abound.So not a cheap shot at all IMO. reply urschrei 15 hours agorootparentprevA statistically significant result without something like a Hedges G (or Cohens D if comparing means) measure would be called out by even a moderately attentive reviewer as a matter of course (especially if small sample sizes are involved), and many reputable journals actually require effect sizes to be stated, so you run the risk of being desk rejected for leaving it out. reply nullc 10 hours agorootparentFor leaving it out perhaps, but the result is publishable even if the effect is small... where for significant you usually must p-hack your way to a standard threshold.It&#x27;s not entirely unreasonable, as often extra variables suppress the effect size. E.g. the effect is substantial in people with some genetics, insignificant otherwise. The fact that there is an effect at all makes it interesting as a starting point for further exploration e.g. to determine the mechanism or find the extra factors needed to make the effect significant. reply travisjungroth 15 hours agorootparentprevAdd some sampling bias, a significance threshold of 0.05.

Challenges are that you have to frequently recompute which experience is best and thus, dynamically reallocate your traffic. They also only works on a single metric, so if your overall evaluation criterion isn‚Äôt just something like ‚Äúclickthrough rate‚Äù, this type of testing becomes more difficult (if anyone else knows how multiple competing metrics are optimized with bandits, feel free to chime in). reply abhgh 10 hours agorootparentBeta-Bernoulli multi-armed bandits (BB-MAB) are definitely a good way to get started on a Bayesian version of A&#x2F;B testing where you&#x27;ve the additional benefit that your population is dynamically allocated to the most performant option (actually this dynamic allocation makes it similar to interim analysis [1] rather than vanilla A&#x2F;B testing).There are some caveats though - and I mention these from the experience of running such solutions on a large scale in production. First, BB-MAB can&#x27;t adapt to context by design. They only look at click&#x2F;no-click behavior across the population. So, if your population has two distinct segments - youth and elderly - who behave very differently wrt purchases, the BB-MAB won&#x27;t pick a different winning advt. per group; its blind to these groups.The solution is to use something like a contextual MAB - which assimilates user features (or whatever you might throw at it) into the MAB. There are simple ways to adapt simple MABs to the contextual setup [2] (in my experience, these can also be effective) but, of course, the literature in this area is wide and deep.A second caveat is that if the ratio of the size of the pool of advts. to the number of impressions is high, the BB-MAB won&#x27;t converge or converge to a good optima; the search space is simply too large relative to the data. In cases like this it becomes important to begin with the right Beta priors, instead of the standard recipe of starting with a Beta that looks like a uniform distribution.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interim_analysis[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;1811.04383 reply fifilura 14 hours agoparentprevI am not the expert and humbled by all the experts in this thread.But I wanted to say that when I looked A&#x2F;B testing few years ago I started off with this book.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;CamDavidsonPilon&#x2F;Probabilistic-Programmin...And somehere down the line he will introduce the Beta&#x2F;Binomial method for A&#x2F;B testing.In my (again humble) understanding the benefit of doing this in the Bayesian way is both that you can actually get an understandable answer, but also that the answer does not have to be the final result you can continue by adding a loss function for example. reply jvans 15 hours agoparentprevStatistical rethinking by McElreath is an exceptional resource for Bayesian modeling.

Publication bias is a known problem when using prior work (see [1] for some references on the problem and potential solutions).One of the strengths of Bayesian methods is that you can use a less informative prior to model your skepticism of prior work.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;medicine-and-dentistry&#x2F;.... reply epgui 16 hours agoparentprevYes, but no more than a non-Bayesian‚Äôs.

    "originBody": "Understanding Every Byte in a WASM Module December 22, 2023 21-minute read In my last post, we explored how to build WASM modules, both with and without WASI support, using Clang. In a comment on Reddit, it was mentioned that much of the setup I walked through in that post could be avoided by just leveraging Zig‚Äôs WASI supprt. This is a great point, and I would recommend doing the same. The following command is inarguably simpler than what I described. $ zig cc --target=wasm32-wasi However, there are two reasons why knowing how to use Clang for compilation is useful. First, and most practical, is that I am working on a codebase that uses Clang for its compiler toolchain, so leveraging Zig is not currently an option. Second is that understanding the, admittedly more involved, Clang incantations taught us a little more about what actually goes into a WASM module, and how that changes when using WASI. In order to know exactly what is inside a WASM module, we need to crack it open though. That is what we are going to do today! As a recap, one of the programs we compiled was a simple add() function, which accepted two integers and returned their sum. wasm32_args.c int add(int a, int b) { return a+b; } We compiled it to a WASM module using the following command. $ /usr/lib/llvm-17/bin/clang -target wasm32 -nostdlib -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export-all -o wasm32_args.wasm wasm32_args.c This produced a binary file which can be recognized as a v1 WASM module. $ file wasm32_args.wasm wasm32_args.wasm: WebAssembly (wasm) binary module version 0x1 (MVP) We can view the hex contents of the file using xxd. $ xxd wasm32_args.wasm 00000000: 0061 736d 0100 0000 010a 0260 0000 6002 .asm.......`..`. 00000010: 7f7f 017f 0303 0200 0105 0301 0002 063f ...............? 00000020: 0a7f 0141 8088 040b 7f00 4180 080b 7f00 ...A......A..... 00000030: 4180 080b 7f00 4180 080b 7f00 4180 8804 A.....A.....A... 00000040: 0b7f 0041 8008 0b7f 0041 8088 040b 7f00 ...A.....A...... 00000050: 4180 8008 0b7f 0041 000b 7f00 4101 0b07 A......A....A... 00000060: a701 0c06 6d65 6d6f 7279 0200 115f 5f77 ....memory...__w 00000070: 6173 6d5f 6361 6c6c 5f63 746f 7273 0000 asm_call_ctors.. 00000080: 0361 6464 0001 0c5f 5f64 736f 5f68 616e .add...__dso_han 00000090: 646c 6503 010a 5f5f 6461 7461 5f65 6e64 dle...__data_end 000000a0: 0302 0b5f 5f73 7461 636b 5f6c 6f77 0303 ...__stack_low.. 000000b0: 0c5f 5f73 7461 636b 5f68 6967 6803 040d .__stack_high... 000000c0: 5f5f 676c 6f62 616c 5f62 6173 6503 050b __global_base... 000000d0: 5f5f 6865 6170 5f62 6173 6503 060a 5f5f __heap_base...__ 000000e0: 6865 6170 5f65 6e64 0307 0d5f 5f6d 656d heap_end...__mem 000000f0: 6f72 795f 6261 7365 0308 0c5f 5f74 6162 ory_base...__tab 00000100: 6c65 5f62 6173 6503 090a 4202 0200 0b3d le_base...B....= 00000110: 0106 7f23 8080 8080 0021 0241 1021 0320 ...#.....!.A.!. 00000120: 0220 036b 2104 2004 2000 3602 0c20 0420 . .k!. . .6.. . 00000130: 0136 0208 2004 2802 0c21 0520 0428 0208 .6.. .(..!. .(.. 00000140: 2106 2005 2006 6a21 0720 070f 0b00 3404 !. . .j!. ....4. 00000150: 6e61 6d65 0119 0200 115f 5f77 6173 6d5f name.....__wasm_ 00000160: 6361 6c6c 5f63 746f 7273 0103 6164 6407 call_ctors..add. 00000170: 1201 000f 5f5f 7374 6163 6b5f 706f 696e ....__stack_poin 00000180: 7465 7200 6609 7072 6f64 7563 6572 7301 ter.f.producers. 00000190: 0c70 726f 6365 7373 6564 2d62 7901 0c55 .processed-by..U 000001a0: 6275 6e74 7520 636c 616e 673f 3137 2e30 buntu clang?17.0 000001b0: 2e36 2028 2b2b 3230 3233 3132 3039 3132 .6 (++2023120912 000001c0: 3432 3237 2b36 3030 3937 3038 6234 3336 4227+6009708b436 000001d0: 372d 317e 6578 7031 7e32 3032 3331 3230 7-1~exp1~2023120 000001e0: 3931 3234 3333 362e 3737 2900 2c0f 7461 9124336.77).,.ta 000001f0: 7267 6574 5f66 6561 7475 7265 7302 2b0f rget_features.+. 00000200: 6d75 7461 626c 652d 676c 6f62 616c 732b mutable-globals+ 00000210: 0873 6967 6e2d 6578 74 .sign-ext As described in the Binary Format portion of the WASM specification, each module is made up of sections. Each section begins with a 1-byte identifier. ID (Decimal) ID (Hex) Section 0 0x00 Custom 1 0x01 Type 2 0x02 Import 3 0x03 Function 4 0x04 Table 5 0x05 Memory 6 0x06 Global 7 0x07 Export 8 0x08 Start 9 0x09 Element 10 0x0a Code 11 0x0b Data 12 0x0c Data Count Each section must be present at most once, and they must be provided in-order, with the exception being Custom sections, for which there may be an arbitrary number and they may be present anywhere in the file. Every section begins with its identifier, then an LEB128 variable-length encoded u32 size, followed by the contents of the section. In fact, all integers in a WASM module are encoded using LEB128. Decoding LEB128 Integers LEB128 can be used to encode signed and unsigned integers of arbitrary length. We will primarily be focused on u32 (unsigned 32-bit) integers today, so we‚Äôll skip detailing how to decode signed integers. You can find more details on the previously linked Wikipedia page. The algorithm for decoding unsigned integers is as follows: Take the least significant (lower) 7 bits of the next byte. Binary shift the 7 bits to the left by 7 multiplied by the byte number (initially 0) and bitwise OR with previously decoded bits. If the most significant bit (i.e. the 8th bit) is a 0, stop decoding. Otherwise, go to step (1). As an example, if we had the byte sequence a6 03, we would decode it using the following steps. Take first byte and convert hex to binary. 0xa6 -> 10100110 Take least significant 7 bits. 10100110 -> 0100110 Shift bits left by 0 (this is the ‚Äú0th‚Äù byte, 7*0 = 0) and OR with previously decoded bits (none decoded yet). 0100110 -> 0100110 Observe that the 8th bit in 0xa6 is a 1, so continue to the next byte. 0x03 -> 00000011 Take least significant 7 bits. 00000011 -> 0000011 Shift bits left by 7 (this is the ‚Äú1st‚Äù byte, 7*1 = 7) and OR with previously decoded bits. 0000011 -> 0000011 0000000 0000000 01001100000011 0000000 = 0000011 0100110 Observe that the 8th bit in 0x03 is 0. We are done. Convert the final result to decimal. 0000011 0100110 -> 422 Now that we know how to interpret integers, let‚Äôs start breaking down the sections. Preamble Link to heading 00000000: 0061 736d 0100 0000 .... .... .... .... .asm.......`..`. Before the first section is the ‚Äúpreamble‚Äù, which is how file was able to recognize that our binary was a v1 WASM module. The first 4 bytes decode to \\0asm, with the next 4 bytes indicating the version. WASM is little-endian, meaning that the least significant byte is first. Therefore, the version number is 1. 0100 0000 -> 0000 0001 -> 1 The first section begins following the preamble. Type Section Link to heading 00000000: .... .... .... .... 010a 0260 0000 6002 .asm.......`..`. 00000010: 7f7f 017f .... .... .... .... .... .... ...............? We can identify the first section as the Type section, as indicated by the first byte 01. Following the identifier is the size, to which we can apply our LEB128 decoding. 0x0a -> 00001010 -> 0001010 -> 10 This informs us that the contents of this section should be 10 bytes in size. The WASM specification describes the Type section contents as a vec of functype. Vectors are simply an LEB128 encoded u32 length followed by a sequence of their specified element type. The first byte is 02, which by now you can probably recognize as 2 without needing to actually perform LEB128 decoding. This means that we should see 2 functype elements next. Function types are prefixed with 0x60, then two vec, one for parameter types, and one for return types, follows. We have 00 00 for the first functype. Remembering that vec are prefixed with length. This is essentially saying that our first function takes 0 parameters and returns 0 values. We can use the wasm2wat tool to verify. $ wasm2wat --enable-annotations wasm32_args.wasmhead -2tail -1 (type (;0;) (func)) The next functype does have parameter and result types. There are two parameters (0x02), each encoded as 0x7f, which corresponds to a signed 32-bit integer (i32). There is one return type (0x01), which is also an i32 (0x7f). Though we don‚Äôt have symbol information about this function yet, given that it is the last one defined we can safely assume this is our add(). $ wasm2wat --enable-annotations wasm32_args.wasmhead -3tail -1 (type (;1;) (func (param i32 i32) (result i32))) Function Section Link to heading 00000010: .... .... 0303 0200 01.. .... .... .... ...............? Next is the Function section (0x03). We do not have an Import section (0x02) in this module because we did not import any symbols. Because sections must be provided in-order, we can be certain that no Import section will be provided now that we have seen the Function section. The size of this section is 3 (0x03), and the contents are specified as a vec of typeidx (type index). A type index is a u32, which will once again be LEB128 encoded. Our vec begins with 0x02, so we should expect two type indices. The following two bytes, 0x00 and 0x01, correspond to the entries in our previously detailed Types section. At this point, we have two functions, each with their own type signature. For this specific module, the Type and Function sections may seem redundant. However, consider if we had another function in our module. int multiply (int a, int b) { return a*b } multiply() has the same function signature as add(), meaning that we would have only one entry for (i32, i32) i32 in the Type section, then two entries in the Function section that referenced the type signature by the corresponding index. Compiling the new program with multiply() added results in an indentical preamble and Type section, but we can see that the Function section (0x03) now has length 4 (0x04), with a type index vec of length 3 (0x03), and three type index entries (0x00, 0x01, 0x01) with the latter two referring to the same type signature. 00000000: 0061 736d 0100 0000 010a 0260 0000 6002 00000010: 7f7f 017f 0304 0300 0101 .... .... .... Memory Section Link to heading 00000010: .... .... .... .... ..05 0301 0002 .... ...............? We once again skip a section that is not present in our module (Table with ID 0x04), and move on to Memory (0x05). The Memory section contains a vec of memories (mem), which are made up of limits. In the current WASM specification, only one memory may be defined. Our Memory section has size of 3 bytes (0x03), and, as expected, the first byte (0x01) specifies that the length of the vec is 1. A limit can include both a maximum and a minimum size (both LEB128 encoded u32), as indicated by the first byte. In our case, the first byte is 0x00, which means that only a minimum size will be defined, and the maximum is free to grow to any size. If the first byte was 0x01, both a minimum and a maximum would be defined. The threads proposal extends limits to be allow specifying whether memory is shared or unshared. In our module, the minimum memory size is 2 (0x02). Global Section Link to heading 00000010: .... .... .... .... .... .... .... 063f ...............? 00000020: 0a7f 0141 8088 040b 7f00 4180 080b 7f00 ...A......A..... 00000030: 4180 080b 7f00 4180 080b 7f00 4180 8804 A.....A.....A... 00000040: 0b7f 0041 8008 0b7f 0041 8088 040b 7f00 ...A.....A...... 00000050: 4180 8008 0b7f 0041 000b 7f00 4101 0b.. A......A....A... The Global section (0x06) is next, with a size of 0x3f. With a larger size, we can quickly check our LEB128 decoding to ensure that we don‚Äôt need to consider subsequent bytes. 0x3f -> 00111111 The 8th bit is 0, so we can simply convert to the decimal value of 63 for our size. The section includes a vec of globals (global), where each global consists of a type (globaltype) and expression (expr). A globaltype is made up of a value type (valtype) and a 1-byte flag (mut) indicating whether the value is mutable or not. An expression is encoded by a sequence of instructions (instr) with a terminating byte (0x0b) specifying the end of the sequence. The byte following the section size, 0x0a, informs us that 10 globals will be defined in the vec. We can easily extract the first one by looking for the first instance of 0x0b. 7f 0141 8088 040b The 0x7f should be familiar at this point as an i32, which is the globaltype of this global. The following byte, 0x01, marks it as mutable (mut). This is followed by the initialization expression, which includes the first instruction we have seen. 0x41 is the opcode for i32.const, which simply returns a static i32 constant, which is specified by the following bytes. We‚Äôll need to use our LEB128 decoding to interpret it. Take the first byte. 0x80 -> 10000000 Take the least significant 7 bits and shift left 0 bits. 10000000 -> 0000000 The 8th bit is a 1 so take the next byte. 0x88 -> 10001000 Take the least significant 7 bits and shift left 7 bits. 10001000 -> 0001000 0000000 OR with previously decoded bits. 0000000 00000000001000 0000000 = 0001000 0000000 The 8th bit is a 1 so take the next byte. 0x04 -> 00000100 Take the least significant 7 bits and shift left 14 bits. 00000100 -> 0000100 0000000 0000000 OR with previously decoded bits. 0000000 0001000 00000000000100 0000000 0000000 = 0000100 0001000 0000000 The 8th bit is a 0 so we are done. 0000100 0001000 0000000 -> 66560 We can verify our decoding using wasm2wat again.

The name is a vec of byte, while the exportdesc contains a 1-byte prefix indicating the type of export, followed by an index to the appropriate section where the export is defined. I‚Äôll leave it to the reader to LEB128 decode 0xa701 as the section size (167 bytes). The first byte following the section size, 0x0c, indicates that the vec will contain 12 exports. The next byte, 0x06, is the first byte of the first export, and thus is defining the length of its name as 6. The following 6 bytes can be converted to UTF-8 characters. 6d 65 6d 6f 72 79 -> memory Because we compiled with -Wl,--export-all, all symbols will be exported. In this case, memory is referring to the first element in the vec in our Memory section. The export type prefixes are defined as follows. ID (Hex) Export 0x00 Function 0x01 Table 0x02 Memory 0x03 Global As expected, the prefix following memory is 0x02. The next byte 0x00, specifies that this export corresponds to the first memory in the vec. The next two exports are our functions. The first is __wasm_call_ctors, which, following the name definition, has a function prefix (0x00) and an index to the first function in the Function section vec (0x00). 11 5f 5f 77 61 73 6d 5f 63 61 6c 6c 5f 63 74 6f 72 73 -> __wasm_call_ctors The second correponds out our add() function, and refers to the second (0x01) function (0x00) in the Function section. 61 64 64 -> add The remaining exports are shown in their textual representation below. $ wasm2wat --enable-annotations wasm32_args.wasmhead -55tail -12 (export \"memory\" (memory 0)) (export \"__wasm_call_ctors\" (func $__wasm_call_ctors)) (export \"add\" (func $add)) (export \"__dso_handle\" (global 1)) (export \"__data_end\" (global 2)) (export \"__stack_low\" (global 3)) (export \"__stack_high\" (global 4)) (export \"__global_base\" (global 5)) (export \"__heap_base\" (global 6)) (export \"__heap_end\" (global 7)) (export \"__memory_base\" (global 8)) (export \"__table_base\" (global 9)) Code Section Link to heading 00000100: .... .... .... .... ..0a 4202 0200 0b3d le_base...B....= 00000110: 0106 7f23 8080 8080 0021 0241 1021 0320 ...#.....!.A.!. 00000120: 0220 036b 2104 2004 2000 3602 0c20 0420 . .k!. . .6.. . 00000130: 0136 0208 2004 2802 0c21 0520 0428 0208 .6.. .(..!. .(.. 00000140: 2106 2005 2006 6a21 0720 070f 0b.. .... !. . .j!. ....4. In this module, we don‚Äôt have a Start (0x08) or Element (0x09) section, so next is the Code section (0x0a). The section size is 66 (LEB128 encoded 0x42), and it consists of the body and local variables of the each function as a vec of code. Each code element consists of a size (u32), vec of locals, and an expression (expr) made up of instructions. Keep in mind that we didn‚Äôt specify any optimizations when compiling this module (e.g. -O3), so our code section is going to be much longer than it needs to be. However, the unoptimized function body gives us an opportunity to explore more WASM instructions. The vec has two elements (0x02), which correspond to the two entries in the Function section. The first function has a size of 2 (0x02), which we can immediately know means that it has no locals or instructions. The vec of locals has a length of 0 (0x00) and the expr, which is its sequence of instructions, is a single 0x0b (the expression terminating byte). The next function, which is our add(), has a size of 61 (0x3d). Its vec of locals has length 1 (0x01). Locals are encoded as a u32 count and a value type (valtype). That is, there is a single element in the vec for each value type for which at least one local exists. Because our vec has length 1, we know that all locals are the same value type. Specifically, there are 6 (0x06) locals of type i32 (0x7f). We‚Äôll save a deep dive into the WASM instruction set architecture (ISA) for a future post, but the key difference from most ISAs you have likely interacted with is that WASM operates as a stack machine. Values that are to be used as operands for an instruction must first be pushed onto the stack, before subsequently being popped off the stack and used to compute a result, which is then pushed onto the stack. The first instruction in our add() function is encoded as 0x23, which corresponds to global.get. This instruction takes the index (u32) of a symbol in the Global section, but you may notice something strange when LEB128 decoding it. 80 80 80 80 00 -> 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 Why are we using the maximum length for LEB128 encoding an unsigned 32-bit integer? The reason is related to Global section merging during linking. Though we only need one byte to encode index 0, if the index of $__stack_pointer changes, we can now be certain that the global.get instruction can be updated without changing the position of any other bytes in the module. As previously mentioned, WASM is a stack machine, so global.get is going to push the value of $__stack_pointer onto the stack. Our next instruction is 0x21, which corresponds to local.set. It pops a value off the top of the stack, then stores it in the local at the index specified by the supplied immediate, which in this case is 2 (0x02). Combining this instruction with the previous one results in storing the value of $__stack_pointer in the local at index 2. Why use 2 and not 0? In accordance with the WASM specification, 2 actually refers to the first declared local, as parameters are referenced as the first locals. The parameters of the function are referenced through 0-based local indices in the function‚Äôs body; they are mutable. You may already recognize these first few instructions as part of a function prologue in which we are ‚Äúgrowing the stack‚Äù. The use of a stack when coming from a language like C can be confusing given that WASM has its own implicit stack. Also, in this particular example, it is unnecessary to manage a stack, and, as you‚Äôll see in a moment, compiling with optimization removes these instructions. Nevertheless, a ‚Äúshadow stack‚Äù is necessary in some real programs, and we‚Äôll explore some examples in a future post. Decompiling the full function body results in the following. $ wasm2wat --enable-annotations wasm32_args.wasmhead -32tail -28 (func $add (type 1) (param i32 i32) (result i32) (local i32 i32 i32 i32 i32 i32) global.get $__stack_pointer local.set 2 i32.const 16 local.set 3 local.get 2 local.get 3 i32.sub local.set 4 local.get 4 local.get 0 i32.store offset=12 local.get 4 local.get 1 i32.store offset=8 local.get 4 i32.load offset=12 local.set 5 local.get 4 i32.load offset=8 local.set 6 local.get 5 local.get 6 i32.add local.set 7 local.get 7 return) The only essential instructions are accesing the parameters (local.get 0 and local.get 1), and the eventual adding of the values with i32.add. This can be observed by recompiling with ooptimization, then Decompiling. clang -target wasm32 -nostdlib -Wl,--no-entry -Wl,--export-all -O3-o wasm32_args_optimized.wasm wasm32_args.c $ wasm2wat --enable-annotations wasm32_args_optimized.wasmhead -8tail -4 (func $add (type 1) (param i32 i32) (result i32) local.get 1 local.get 0 i32.add) Custom Sections Link to heading 00000140: .... .... .... .... .... .... ..00 3404 !. . .j!. ....4. 00000150: 6e61 6d65 0119 0200 115f 5f77 6173 6d5f name.....__wasm_ 00000160: 6361 6c6c 5f63 746f 7273 0103 6164 6407 call_ctors..add. 00000170: 1201 000f 5f5f 7374 6163 6b5f 706f 696e ....__stack_poin 00000180: 7465 7200 6609 7072 6f64 7563 6572 7301 ter.f.producers. 00000190: 0c70 726f 6365 7373 6564 2d62 7901 0c55 .processed-by..U 000001a0: 6275 6e74 7520 636c 616e 673f 3137 2e30 buntu clang?17.0 000001b0: 2e36 2028 2b2b 3230 3233 3132 3039 3132 .6 (++2023120912 000001c0: 3432 3237 2b36 3030 3937 3038 6234 3336 4227+6009708b436 000001d0: 372d 317e 6578 7031 7e32 3032 3331 3230 7-1~exp1~2023120 000001e0: 3931 3234 3333 362e 3737 2900 2c0f 7461 9124336.77).,.ta 000001f0: 7267 6574 5f66 6561 7475 7265 7302 2b0f rget_features.+. 00000200: 6d75 7461 626c 652d 676c 6f62 616c 732b mutable-globals+ 00000210: 0873 6967 6e2d 6578 74 .sign-ext The remaining bytes make up three Custom sections (0x00), as there is no Data (0x0b) section or Data Count (0x0c) section in our module. Custom sections are mostly unstructured, but do begin with the same u32 size as other sections, followed by a name. The 0x00 byte identifies our first custom section, and its size is 52 bytes (0x34). The name encoding starts with the number of bytes in the name, which in this case is 4 (0x04). The following 4 bytes are UTF-8 characters making up the name. 6e 61 6d 65 -> n a m e The name of this custom section happens to literally be ‚Äúname‚Äù. It also happens to be the only Custom section that is defined in the WASM specification (see Custom Sections in the Appendix). Like other sections, it should only be included at most once, and it has the additional requirement of occurring after the Data section. There are three subsections that may be included in the ‚Äúname‚Äù Custom section, identified by the following IDs. ID (Hex) Subsection 0x00 Module name 0x01 Function names 0x02 Local names The first subsection is Function names (0x01), and has size of 25 (0x19). It consists of a vec of name / index pairs, otherwise known as a ‚Äúname map‚Äù, which assigns the provided name to the given index in the Function section. The vec here is of length 2 (0x02), and first element corresponds to the first function in the Function section (0x00). The name assigned to the function is 17 bytes long (0x11). 5f 5f 77 61 73 6d 5f 63 61 6c 6c 5f 63 74 6f 72 73 -> __wasm_call_ctors The following function name entry can be decoded in the same manner, predictably assigning add to the second function in the Function section (0x01). 61 64 64 -> add The next and final subsection of the ‚Äúname‚Äù Custom section is not actually standardized in the core WASM specification, but rather part of the Extended Name Section proposal. In the proposal, 7 (0x07) is the index for the Global names subsection. This subsection also contains a ‚Äúname map‚Äù, providing pairs of a Global section index and name. The first entry in our Global section (0x00) is being assigned the name __stack_pointer. 5f 5f 73 74 61 63 6b 5f 70 6f 69 6e 74 65 72 -> __stack_pointer The next two Custom sections are defined in the WASM tool-conventions repository. The first is named producers, and is meant to denote the tools that were used to produce the WASM module. The second is named target_features and must come after the producers Custom secion when included. It describes what features are used, and whether linking should fail if a given feature is or is not in the allowed set. The full decompilation of all three Custom sections is as follows. $ wasm2wat --enable-annotations wasm32_args.wasmtail -3 (@custom \"name\" \"\\01\\19\\02\\00\\11__wasm_call_ctors\\01\\03add\\07\\12\\01\\00\\0f__stack_pointer\") (@custom \"producers\" \"\\01\\0cprocessed-by\\01\\0cUbuntu clang?17.0.6 (++20231209124227+6009708b4367-1~exp1~20231209124336.77)\") (@custom \"target_features\" \"\\02+\\0fmutable-globals+\\08sign-ext\")) The --enable-annotations, which we have been using for all wasm2wat invocations, is required to include Custom sections in the WAT output.

Wouldn&#x27;t it be much easier to use 8 bits? reply teraflop 18 hours agorootparentIf you use all 8 bits of a byte for data, you need a separate way to store the length, or you need to make everything fixed-width which wastes space.\"Varints\" or variable-length integers, with 7 bits of data and 1 continuation bit per byte, are used in a fairly wide variety of formats (e.g. Protobuf, SQLite and Lucene). They&#x27;re compact when most of your integers are small, while still being quite simple and fast to encode&#x2F;decode.Faster alternatives tend to be more complicated, and more compact alternatives tend to be slower.See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Variable-length_quantity reply joquarky 13 hours agorootparentI wonder if something resembling this could have been better than how IPv6 attempts to solve the address space problem. reply svat 18 hours agorootparentprevThis is basically the design of UTF-8 or varint encoding. The integer&#x27;s representation is read one byte (8 bits) at a time, which can then be interpreted by looking at the first bit which says whether the integer is \"done\" or more bytes need to be read.(If we were using all 8 bits for the representation and an additional leading bit for whether it continues, we&#x27;d end up having to read 9 bits or something, which is awkward and not aligned with what the machine actually supports reading.) reply flohofwoe 17 hours agorootparentUTF-8 is a bit more complex than that.The first byte in a sequence basically tells you how many bytes are following by looking at the top-most bits. 0xxxxxxx => no followup bytes, just the 7-bit ASCII code 110xxxxx => 1 byte follows 1110xxxx => 2 bytes follow 11110xxx => 3 bytes followThe followup bytes then always have the pattern 10xxxxxx.E.g. the only bytes that have bit 7 cleared are the single-byte 7-bit ASCII character codes. reply Mindless2112 15 hours agorootparentA UTF-8-like encoding would probably be better than VLQ encoding because the length is known up-front, which allows for the decoder to have fewer branches.Something like [1] or alternatively [2].

[1]Using variable-length \"micro-compression\" schemes like these merges concerns [2], add processing overhead, and lose out on the simplicity and efficiency of working on the data directly in memory, maybe even reusing the same memory&#x2F;cache line after checking identifiers, etc.The 7-bit VLQ scheme [3] makes sense for MIDI sequences (1980s), as they were stored on MIDI hardware with limited memory, and had basic processing needs.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;quoteinvestigator.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;08&#x2F;640k-enough&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Separation_of_concerns[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Variable-length_quantity reply monocasa 16 hours agorootparentEh, I don&#x27;t think the .wasm file is intended to be an in memory format. For an on wire&#x2F;storage format, variable length integers like protobuf uses is a perfectly valid choice. reply dataangel 14 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s actually the protobuf design mistake that most adversely affects decoding performance. The original creator who went on to make Cap&#x27;N Proto makes the excellent point that it&#x27;s better to leave the extra bytes and then just slap a compressor that only works on runs of 0 bytes on top. Faster for the same savings. There are also newer schemes from Daniel Lemire and others more amenable to SIMD decoding. reply monocasa 13 hours agorootparentSure, but that decoding speed penalty doesn&#x27;t stop protobuf (and similar encodings using leb128 like thrift) from being some of the most used binary encodings on the planet, even in relatively low latency spaces.Additionally, Cap&#x27;N Proto RLE encodes the bytestream, which is pretty similar to the overhead of LEB128 integers.And on top of all of that, .wasm isn&#x27;t intended to be an IPC format, so the fact that it&#x27;s choices are typical of that space (despite not being leading edge) reflect very well for the space it&#x27;s intended to be in. reply rockwotj 18 hours agorootparentprevIt is a balance between simplicity, speed and size. They choose size, honesty leb128 isn‚Äôt *too* complex (you can see an implementation in my repo I pointed too). But yes they don‚Äôt take all the simplicity tradeoffs. reply willtemperley 17 hours agorootparentProtobuf seems to use a very similar encoding. reply kevingadd 12 hours agorootparentprevIt would be. The use of varints in wasm complicates encoding and decoding and introduces ambiguity into the format for cases like v128 constants (which despite technically being 128-bit integers, are not embedded using leb128.) It also makes it harder to write a single-pass compiler.It also isn&#x27;t much of a wire size improvement, since the overall format design assumes you will compress it using brotli (or gzip, I guess) - there are lots of opportunities to make the format smaller or arrange it in a way that makes it more compressible, and the decision was made not to do those things since brotli is really good at compressing data.I think the people who took control of the binary format just really liked varints for some reason, so we ended up stuck with them. It&#x27;s at least not particularly harmful, it&#x27;s just a small waste of everyone&#x27;s time.

I&#x27;m having a hard time pinpointing the exact moment where the WASM is being loaded (because the JS that performs all those things is horribly obfuscated, too.)The disassembled view in the dev tools might come in handy to tackle this. My goal is to obtain their secret HMAC key so I can change \"Linux\" into whatever the server prefers to hear, and re-sign the HMAC for that manipulated HTTP request before the player sends it.(All that effort so I finally get to watch my Bundesliga streams again, for which I&#x27;m paying them 30 EUR a month.) reply hoten 14 hours agorootparentCtrl+f for the WASM compile function (or maybe replace it with a wrapper function that has a debugger statement), breakpoint there, step over, then look in the Sources panel.

    "title": "How B-tree Optimizes Database Queries",
    "originLink": "https://blog.allegro.tech/2023/11/how-does-btree-make-your-queries-fast.html",
    "originBody": "B-tree is a structure that helps to search through great amounts of data. It was invented over 40 years ago, yet it is still employed by the majority of modern databases. Although there are newer index structures, like LSM trees, B-tree is unbeaten when handling most of the database queries. After reading this post, you will know how B-tree organises the data and how it performs search queries. Origins In order to understand B-tree let‚Äôs focus on Binary Search Tree (BST) first. Wait, isn‚Äôt it the same? What does ‚ÄúB‚Äù stand for then? According to wikipedia.org, Edward M. McCreight, the inventor of B-tree, once said: ‚Äúthe more you think about what the B in B-trees means, the better you understand B-trees.‚Äù Confusing B-tree with BST is a really common misconception. Anyway, in my opinion, BST is a great starting point for reinventing B-tree. Let‚Äôs start with a simple example of BST: The greater number is always on the right, the lower on the left. It may become clearer when we add more numbers. This tree contains seven numbers, but we need to visit at most three nodes to locate any number. The following example visualizes searching for 14. I used SQL to define the query in order to think about this tree as if it were an actual database index. Hardware In theory, using Binary Search Tree for running our queries looks fine. Its time complexity (when searching) is \\(O(log n)\\), same as B-tree. However, in practice, this data structure needs to work on actual hardware. An index must be stored somewhere on your machine. The computer has three places where the data can be stored: CPU caches RAM (memory) Disk (storage) The cache is managed fully by CPUs. Moreover, it is relatively small, usually a few megabytes. Index may contain gigabytes of data, so it won‚Äôt fit there. Databases vastly use Memory (RAM). It has some great advantages: assures fast random access (more on that in the next paragraph) its size may be pretty big (e.g. AWS RDS cloud service provides instances with a few terabytes of memory available). Cons? You lose the data when the power supply goes off. Moreover, when compared to the disk, it is pretty expensive. Finally, the cons of a memory are the pros of a disk storage. It‚Äôs cheap, and data will remain there even if we lose the power. However, there are no free lunches! The catch is that we need to be careful about random and sequential access. Reading from the disk is fast, but only under certain conditions! I‚Äôll try to explain them simply. Random and sequential access Memory may be visualized as a line of containers for values, where every container is numbered. Now let‚Äôs assume we want to read data from containers 1, 4, and 6. It requires random access: And then let‚Äôs compare it with reading containers 3, 4, and 5. It may be done sequentially: The difference between a ‚Äúrandom jump‚Äù and a ‚Äúsequential read‚Äù can be explained based on Hard Disk Drive. It consists of the head and the disk. ‚ÄúRandom jump‚Äù requires moving the head to the given place on the disk. ‚ÄúSequential read‚Äù is simply spinning the disk, allowing the head to read consecutive values. When reading megabytes of data, the difference between these two types of access is enormous. Using ‚Äúsequential reads‚Äù lowers the time needed to fetch the data significantly. Differences in speed between random and sequential access were researched in the article ‚ÄúThe Pathologies of Big Data‚Äù by Adam Jacobs, published in Acm Queue. It revealed a few mind-blowing facts: Sequential access on HDD may be hundreds of thousands of times faster than random access. ü§Ø It may be faster to read sequentially from the disk than randomly from the memory. Who even uses HDD nowadays? What about SSD? This research shows that reading fully sequentially from HDD may be faster than SSD. However, please note that the article is from 2009 and SSD developed significantly through the last decade, thus these results are probably outdated. To sum up, the key takeaway is to prefer sequential access wherever we can. In the next paragraph, I will explain how to apply it to our index structure. Optimizing a tree for sequential access Binary Search Tree may be represented in memory in the same way as the heap: parent node position is \\(i\\) left node position is \\(2i\\) right node position is \\(2i+1\\) That‚Äôs how these positions are calculated based on the example (the parent node starts at 1): According to the calculated positions, nodes are aligned into the memory: Do you remember the query visualized a few chapters ago? That‚Äôs what it looks like on the memory level: When performing the query, memory addresses 1, 3, and 6 need to be visited. Visiting three nodes is not a problem; however, as we store more data, the tree gets higher. Storing more than one million values requires a tree of height at least 20. It means that 20 values from different places in memory must be read. It causes completely random access! Pages While a tree grows in height, random access is causing more and more delay. The solution to reduce this problem is simple: grow the tree in width rather than in height. It may be achieved by packing more than one value into a single node. It brings us the following benefits: the tree is shallower (two levels instead of three) it still has a lot of space for new values without the need for growing further The query performed on such index looks as follows: Please note that every time we visit a node, we need to load all its values. In this example, we need to load 4 values (or 6 if the tree is full) in order to reach the one we are looking for. Below, you will find a visualization of this tree in a memory: Compared to the previous example (where the tree grows in height), this search should be faster. We need random access only twice (jump to cells 0 and 9) and then sequentially read the rest of values. This solution works better and better as our database grows. If you want to store one million values, then you need: Binary Search Tree which has 20 levels OR 3-value node Tree which has 10 levels Values from a single node make a page. In the example above, each page consists of three values. A page is a set of values placed on a disk next to each other, so the database may reach the whole page at once with one sequential read. And how does it refer to the reality? Postgres page size is 8kB. Let‚Äôs assume that 20% is for metadata, so it‚Äôs 6kB left. Half of the page is needed to store pointers to node‚Äôs children, so it gives us 3kB for values. BIGINT size is 8 bytes, thus we may store ~375 values in a single page. Assuming that some pretty big tables in a database have one billion rows, how many levels in the Postgres tree do we need to store them? According to the calculations above, if we create a tree that can handle 375 values in a single node, it may store 1 billion values with a tree that has only four levels. Binary Search Tree would require 30 levels for such amount of data. To sum up, placing multiple values in a single node of the tree helped us to reduce its height, thus using the benefits of sequential access. Moreover, a B-tree may grow not only in height, but also in width (by using larger pages). Balancing There are two types of operations in databases: writing and reading. In the previous section, we addressed the problems with reading the data from the B-tree. Nonetheless, writing is also a crucial part. When writing the data to a database, B-tree needs to be constantly updated with new values. The tree shape depends on the order of values added to the tree. It‚Äôs easily visible in a binary tree. We may obtain trees with different depths if the values are added in an incorrect order. When the tree has different depths on different nodes, it is called an unbalanced tree. There are basically two ways of returning such a tree to a balanced state: Rebuilding it from the very beginning just by adding the values in the correct order. Keeping it balanced all the time, as the new values are added. B-tree implements the second option. A feature that makes the tree balanced all the time is called self-balancing. Self-balancing algorithm by example Building a B-tree can be started simply by creating a single node and adding new values until there is no free space in it. If there is no space on the corresponding page, it needs to be split. To perform a split, a ‚Äûsplit point‚Äù is chosen. In that case, it will be 12, because it is in the middle. The ‚ÄûSplit point‚Äù is a value that will be moved to the upper page. Now, it gets us to an interesting point where there is no upper page. In such a case, a new one needs to be generated (and it becomes the new root page!). And finally, there is some free space in the three, so value 14 may be added. Following this algorithm, we may constantly add new values to the B-tree, and it will remain balanced all the time! At this point, you may have a valid concern that there is a lot of free space that has no chance to be filled. For example, values 14, 15, and 16, are on different pages, so these pages will remain with only one value and two free spaces forever. It was caused by the split location choice. We always split the page in the middle. But every time we do a split, we may choose any split location we want. Postgres has an algorithm that is run every time a split is performed! Its implementation may be found in the _bt_findsplitloc() function in Postgres source code. Its goal is to leave as little free space as possible. Summary In this article, you learned how a B-tree works. All in all, it may be simply described as a Binary Search Tree with two changes: every node may contain more than one value inserting a new value is followed by a self-balancing algorithm. Although the structures used by modern databases are usually some variants of a B-tree (like B+tree), they are still based on the original conception. In my opinion, one great strength of a B-tree is the fact that it was designed directly to handle large amounts of data on actual hardware. It may be the reason why the B-tree has remained with us for such a long time.",

(allegro.tech) 171 points by jaycox2931 13 hours ago| hidepastfavorite39 comments dicroce 10 hours agoI always think discussions like this should start with the following: A database with no indexes is slow. Finding a particular row will require a linear search. Adding an index on a column means that your optimizing finding rows by the values of that column. Hence, an index is really a mapping of a particular column&#x27;s value to the position in the db OF that row (very likely an 8 byte sized integer that is the offset into the file of the row in question).This all means we can implement indexes as b-trees where the keys are the values of a particular column and the value is the file offset of the row with that value. You could envision a simple db format where indexes and the main row file are stored in separate files. In such a database you could drop an index simply by deleting the indexes file (or add one by creating it). The main row file actually has all of the data and so indexes can be recreated if necessary (at expense of course). reply code_biologist 7 hours agoparentA database with no indexes is slow. Finding a particular row will require a linear search.The crux is understanding what data access patterns you will have and what indexes &#x2F; data structures accelerate that access pattern. \"Index = fast\" is a painfully pernicious untrue meme. It&#x27;s absolutely true for application tables with queries only touching a few rows. On the other hand, analytics queries touching a high proportion of rows with joins on equality conditions (ie. hash joinable) isn&#x27;t going to go any faster with an index.I&#x27;ve seen devs shotgun indexes at tables to fix performance (done it myself too) but the real test of index understanding is when that doesn&#x27;t work. reply valenterry 5 hours agorootparent> On the other hand, analytics queries touching a high proportion of rows with joins on equality conditions (ie. hash joinable) isn&#x27;t going to go any faster with an index.That&#x27;s when you bring a BRIN to the table. :-) reply darkclouds 7 hours agorootparentprev> The crux is understanding what data access patterns you will have and what indexes &#x2F; data structures accelerate that access patternWe have a winner.

Not uncommon to rely on mmap at which point your disk access is sub-optimal vs. a hand-tailored buffer manager with strategies to improve disk reads. reply sschnei8 7 hours agorootparentThis requires the obligatory https:&#x2F;&#x2F;db.cs.cmu.edu&#x2F;mmap-cidr2022&#x2F; reply fsckboy 6 hours agorootparentprevthe purpose of a btree is to optimize when you are hitting the disk, you can&#x27;t call that the struggle, that&#x27;s when the btree sings (tho you could consider extensible hashing) reply kevingadd 6 hours agorootparentprevMy throughput was significantly higher than sqlite (4x or so, if memory serves), but the kernel spent so much time swapping pages that the mouse cursor stuttered.A custom page manager would have probably done the trick, but I don&#x27;t have the technical chops to write one. reply marginalia_nu 12 hours agoprevAnother neat part is that, for intersecting different B-trees, you can use a technique like this to get very efficient algorithm: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nlp.stanford.edu&#x2F;IR-book&#x2F;html&#x2F;htmledition&#x2F;faster-pos...(Here discussed in terms of skip lists, but they are similar enough that the distinction doesn&#x27;t matter) reply o11c 12 hours agoparentNote that the real primitive is \"find nearest [with hint]\", which has to be the #1 thing I miss in Python.For B-trees it&#x27;s only going to be a significant win if the chance of intersection is small, less than about `1&#x2F;(nodes_per_block)`. For binary trees it&#x27;s a much bigger win since that becomes 1&#x2F;2 and binary trees are horrible on cache.Hmm, can you efficiently intersect an arbitrary number of B-trees using the same idea as a heap-merge, but with a max heap instead of a min heap? You&#x27;d still have to iterate over all on a match, but as long as 2 input trees don&#x27;t have an intersection, you don&#x27;t have to look at the others at all ... or does that become equivalent to just doing them in series? reply marginalia_nu 10 hours agorootparentA nuance that is important here is that not all accesses are equal within the context of disk reads. B-trees are designed to minimize block reads, not memory operations.I guess there are worst case scenarios with evenly spaced intersections spread out exactly one per block, but in terms of block reads it fundamentally doesn&#x27;t matter how you intersect two such trees, you&#x27;ll still have to read all blocks, and that is orders of magnitude slower than comparing the values within.I think the tree structure can be considered cached in real world scenarios; not really relevant to the performance you&#x27;ll get. reply avinassh 3 hours agoprev> To sum up, the key takeaway is to prefer sequential access wherever we can.For spinning disks, this is obvious. But why is sequential access faster on SSDs? reply wizerno 2 hours agoparentTLDR; Garbage Collection.In an SSD, a write operation can only be done when the page is already erased. However, the unit of read&#x2F;write operations are a page, while the unit of erase operation is a block. That means for a disk write, a naive implementation needs to read the whole block, erase the block, then write updated data back to the block, which is unacceptable. Furthermore, blocks should wear out uniformly, otherwise, the SSD would lose capacity.To tackle these problems, SSD introduces Flash Translation Layer (FTL) which helps to build an illusion of random access device. To achieve this, FTL employs an approach very similar to LSM trees. Writes are always written to new, already erased pages, while in the background, garbage collects (GC) outdated data. FTL needs to keep a map from the user‚Äôs logical address to physical address on SSD, both in-memory and persistently.So to answer your question, why are sequential writes are faster than random writes on SSDs? Because the address map table is smaller since new data is consecutive in larger chunks. Garbage Collection is simpler and only metadata needs to be updated. Erasing a block is required anyway. reply infogulch 2 hours agoparentprevLike sibling said, physical pages are typically much bigger than logical pages in SSDs. Also drives do prediction and sequential access is easy to predict. reply zerr 2 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d assume at some level of IO, blocks&#x2F;pages&#x2F;whole buffers are being read, as opposed to reading bytes one by one.

Even a decade ago my experience performance testing Exadata implied some exotic magic at work, ie lookups are way faster than the expected O(log n). More recently while testing SQL Server&#x27;s ability to join hundreds of tables together the performance was _way_ in excess of what I expected. I can&#x27;t imagine these things have internals all that similar to say the B+Tree inside MySQL for example. reply kevingadd 9 hours agoparentA lot of this comes down to query planners being really good at finding clever ways of doing scans and intersections of indexes, the tables themselves having indexes with a bunch of specialized representations, and the query execution doing very intelligent data traversal with partitioning or even multi-threading.If you sit down and think carefully about your data you can often make even a simple bare-bones B-tree perform fantastically for a query, well in excess of what you&#x27;d get out of mysql or sqlite (which are already pretty fast). reply jiggawatts 9 hours agoparentprevOn disk, SQL Server uses only b-trees, unless using the new ColumnStore format.In memory during a query it can use temporary indexes of other types, primarily hash tables and bitmaps.Its performance on ad-hoc complex queries is about as good as it gets, few if any other RDBMS can beat its performance, but under the hood it‚Äôs still mostly just doing joins on b-trees! reply gfody 8 hours agorootparent> ..under the hood it‚Äôs still mostly just doing joins on b-trees!I could see the on-disk format needing to be simple and stable, but once the datas buffered who knows what structures and algorithms these proprietary engines are using?

    "commentBody": "Otter, Fastest Go in-memory cache based on S3-FIFO algorithmHacker NewspastloginOtter, Fastest Go in-memory cache based on S3-FIFO algorithm (github.com/maypok86) 163 points by rickette 18 hours ago| hidepastfavorite53 comments tomalaci 16 hours agoFor a long time Go did not expose their super efficient internal map hashing algorithm that, if possible, would use AES instructions from the processor to hash even faster. That is, they did not expose it as an official API. People usually did some \"unsafe\" usage to link to that internal hashing function for their own super-fast map implementations.That was changed some time ago. They released official maphash package: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkg.go.dev&#x2F;hash&#x2F;maphashOtter author could probably look into replacing their 3rd party hashing dependency (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dolthub&#x2F;maphash) with the official one and knock off an unneeded dependency :) reply tedunangst 15 hours agoparenthash&#x2F;maphash isn&#x27;t a very good replacement if you&#x27;re trying to hash simple structs, since they still require conversion to byte slice by some means. reply Thaxll 13 hours agorootparentHash functions all work on bytes sequence or string, hashing a struct&#x2F;class&#x2F;object is a different use case. reply ncruces 10 hours agorootparentprevYou use unsafe for that bit. Still less gross than DoltHub&#x27;s take on it. reply falsandtru 16 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36434358Note that S3-FIFO has no loop resistance. Nevertheless, the result that this library is functioning in a loop indicates that some important changes have been made. Also, the result that Ristretto, which has loop resistance, is not functioning in a loop is clearly an anomaly and likely not being measured correctly. Ristretto&#x27;s benchmark results on S3, DS1, and OLTP differ markedly from the official ones (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dgraph-io&#x2F;ristretto). Otter&#x27;s benchmark results are quite suspicious. reply NovaX 15 hours agoparentI think you may be right. The library author said he made many changes because implementing the eviction policy following the paper&#x27;s design was pretty awful.> First, I tried to implement cache on hash table and lock free queues, as the authors wrote. I was annoyed, s3-fifo was indeed many times faster than lru cache implemented on hash table with global mutex, but still lost to ristretto and theine, which use bp-wrapper techniques. The profiler also showed that it was the eviction policy that was spending the bulk of the time. And I was only able to beat ristretto and theine after rewriting the implementation using bp-wrapper.> In summary, I completely disagree about the scalability advantage of S3-FIFO over the other policies> Though to be honest, what was causing the hit ratio to go down in DS1 I still don&#x27;t understandhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Yiling-J&#x2F;theine-go&#x2F;issues&#x2F;29#issuecomment... reply maypok86 1 hour agoparentprev1. Unfortunately, ristretto has been showing hit ratio around 0 on almost all traces for a very long time now and the authors don&#x27;t respond to this in any way. Vitess for example has already changed it to another cache. Here are two issues about it: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dgraph-io&#x2F;ristretto&#x2F;issues&#x2F;346 and https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dgraph-io&#x2F;ristretto&#x2F;issues&#x2F;336. That is, ristretto shows such results even on its own benchmarks. You can see it just by running hit ratio benchmarks on a very simple zipf distribution from the ristretto repository: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dgraph-io&#x2F;ristretto&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;stress_test.... On this test I got the following: stress_test.go:75: actual: 0.07, optimal: 0.682. Yes, otter contains a number of changes to the algorithm that in my opinion improve it. For example, S3-FIFO in otter does not have a worst case time complexity equal to O(n), there O(1).3. But the fact that S3-FIFO performs worse on DS1 than LRU sounds very doubtful. It sounds more like a bug in the implementation, since even on the caffeine simulator S3-FIFO wins.linked.Lru 20.24 % product.Caffeine 45.82 % sampled.sampled.Lru 20.55 % two-queue.Qdlp 30.73 % reply medler 15 hours agoparentprevCould you share some pointers where I can read more on ‚Äúloop resistance?‚Äù Does that just refer to whether it does well on a looping access pattern? reply senderista 14 hours agorootparentThe usual phrase is \"scan resistance\", which is especially important for databases. A pure LRU policy does poorly on scans; LFU does better but performs worse than LRU on other workloads. The original ARC paper[0] has a good discussion of the tradeoffs.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;legacy&#x2F;events&#x2F;fast03&#x2F;tech&#x2F;full_papers... reply falsandtru 14 hours agorootparentScan resistance and loop resistance are completely different. They are also distinguished in the papers. Note that ARC has scan resistance but no loop resistance. reply medler 14 hours agorootparentNone of the papers linked above or linked in the GitHub repo mention ‚Äúloop resistance.‚Äù reply senderista 14 hours agorootparentprevNot completely different; they&#x27;re both sequential access patterns and equivalent whenever the loop size exceeds cache size. reply falsandtru 13 hours agorootparentNot equivalent completely. Scan is a one-time access, so it never hits in scanning. Loop is multi-time accesses, so it can get many hits in looping if it has loop resistance. No hits on scan resistance in looping. Over. reply falsandtru 5 hours agorootparentI am disgusted by people who are repulsed by even the correction of a complete error. They must have bad grades in college. From now on, we have no choice but to leave it alone even if a false rumor is spread. replyfalsandtru 13 hours agorootparentprevSometimes referred to as tolerance. There is no established terminology, so the only way to find out is to use scan or loop as keywords. reply someplaceguy 13 hours agorootparentSo why did you say S3-FIFO has no loop resistance (or loop tolerance)? reply falsandtru 13 hours agorootparentThere is an established benchmark for testing loop resistance (GLI, Loop). S3-FIFO has not passed this test. And I have already confirmed that S3-FIFO does not pass the test. reply someplaceguy 12 hours agorootparentThe design of S3-FIFO seems to imply it should handle all loops less than 90% of the cache size pretty well, perhaps even up to 100%.Did you figure out why it did not pass the test? Was there a bug in the implementation, perhaps?Also, where can I find the benchmark you speak of? My web search did not find anything. reply falsandtru 12 hours agorootparentMy implementation is reviewed and linked from the official S3-FIFO page.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3fifo.comA benchmark is as follows.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ben-manes&#x2F;caffeine&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;EfficiencyI can&#x27;t deal with you any longer. Over. reply NovaX 11 hours agorootparent&#x2F;u&#x2F;someplaceguy,Those LIRS traces, along with many others, are available at this page [1]. I did a cursory review using their traces with Caffeine&#x27;s and the author&#x27;s simulators to avoid bias or a mistaken implementation. In their target workloads Caffeine was on par or better [2]. I have not seen anything novel in this or their previous works and find their claims to be easily disproven, so I have not implement this policy in Caffeine‚Äôs simulator yet.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ben-manes&#x2F;caffeine&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Simulator[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;1a1a11a&#x2F;libCacheSim&#x2F;discussions&#x2F;20 reply falsandtru 11 hours agorootparentI did a comparison on your data sets such as DS1, and S3-FIFO had very lower hit ratios than LRU in most cases. I think there are very limited situations where S3-FIFO is best. replysomeplaceguy 13 hours agoparentprevS3-FIFO has scan resistance. What do you mean by \"loop resistance\" and why do you say S3-FIFO doesn&#x27;t have it? reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agoprevI didn&#x27;t know what the S3-FIFO algorithm was. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3fifo.com&#x2F; gives a great overview with some good visuals. reply 1f60c 13 hours agoparentThis entire time, I thought it had something to do with Amazon S3. reply coxley 12 hours agoprevSorry if I missed it, but does Otter do anything special to limit GC-impact when caching lots of references? That&#x27;s the main selling point for bigcache and freecache. reply maypok86 1 hour agoparentNo, and it&#x27;s not planned (otter tries to avoid additional pressure on gc if possible, but that&#x27;s not always possible). And I&#x27;m extremely frustrated that I had to include bigcache and fastcache in these benchmarks, since many people don&#x27;t know the differences at all and just focus on performance and other metrics. Especially since bigcache and fastcache will only have an advantage when storing a huge number of items (well over 10 million). So I&#x27;ll probably just add a P.S. in the README about it. reply jhoechtl 4 hours agoprevI always thought Go as a GC&#x27;ed language is unsuitable as a caching instrument? reply mvcalder 14 hours agoprevI wrote up this analysis of cache one-hits after reading the FIFO is all you need paper.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polyscale.ai&#x2F;blog&#x2F;one-hit-expectation reply mparnisari 11 hours agoprevHow does it compare to https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scalalang2&#x2F;golang-fifo? reply scalalang 3 hours agoparentHi, I made this repo. I&#x27;m here to drop my opinions as below.[1]- golang-fifo provides also SIEVE algorithm which is more effieicnt than S3-FIFO under web cache workloads(follows zipf&#x27;s distribution)[2]- I added otter to my cache benchmark. It shows less efficiency than mine. I&#x27;m not sure why this happens.See results here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;scalalang2&#x2F;go-cache-benchmark[3]- If the behavior of the two algorithms is the same, they should produce similar results. but they shows different results.- Otter is faster with more concurrency, but misses more stuff (shows less hit&#x2F;rate). reply almost_usual 16 hours agoprevPretty much 2Q without the LRU. reply jeffbee 14 hours agoparentI never really understood why anyone wants to maintain LRU properties in caches. It doesn&#x27;t make sense today and it didn&#x27;t make sense decades ago, either. You do need some rational basis for eviction, but ranking your hot set on every access was always just weird. I am glad this is being fixed in the literature lately. reply grandinj 1 hour agorootparentWhat would you suggest as an alternative basis for eviction? reply michalmatczuk 15 hours agoprevThe issue is Go stdlib does not have parallel hash map.We have https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;puzpuzpuz&#x2F;xsync#map a different Cache line hashmap impl. reply 1f60c 13 hours agoparentWhat about https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pkg.go.dev&#x2F;sync#Map? reply tedunangst 16 hours agoprevI was curious what function was used for hashing (how do you write a generic hash function in go?) and it&#x27;s pretty disgusting.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dolthub&#x2F;maphash&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;runtime.go reply lukevp 16 hours agoparentCould you provide more context on what‚Äôs disgusting? I‚Äôm not a go programmer but this looks like it‚Äôs just a wrapper around a library called ‚Äòmaphash‚Äô and doesn‚Äôt do any of the hashing here? This is more of a service wrapper around that lib so that it can have a consistent seed value etc.? reply tedunangst 15 hours agorootparentConstructing a map (an opaque type) just so you cast it to a carefully duplicated struct so you can steal the function pointer is kinda nutso.Did you look at the linked code in maphash? reply sidlls 16 hours agorootparentprevI wouldn&#x27;t call it disgusting. It&#x27;s just typical unsafe go code. The named return parameter in `getRuntimeHasher` is irritating, as all such parameters in go code are. If you&#x27;re going to return values, do so explicitly in the return statement. In go code, seeing `return` at the end of a function does not mean that the function doesn&#x27;t return any values, and that can lead to harder-to-read code. reply insanitybit 15 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s just typical unsafe go code.But... just to hash something? reply sidlls 14 hours agorootparentGo has a lot of lower level internal implementations of things that unsafe code like this serves as a thin shim for. It‚Äôs an almost zero-cost abstraction to use such a builtin.I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs good: it just is what it is. It‚Äôs silly: but so is most of go. I‚Äôve worked with this language for several years now: I don‚Äôt like it at all. It presents a facade of simplicity, but has all sorts of hidden issues that affect performance and behavior in surprising ways. reply insanitybit 14 hours agorootparentI think we&#x27;re all saying the same thing then. reply brabel 16 hours agorootparentprevI suppose the use of unsafe pointers liberally is disgusting to some. reply oooyay 15 hours agoparentprevDisgusting is a word, but I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;d say the same about most unsupported feature code (aka unsafe). You can make code like this reliable in the ways it needs to be while still being \"unsafe\". That&#x27;s kind of table stakes when you start dabbling in unsupported things. reply tedunangst 14 hours agorootparentAnd what does this code do to make itself reliable in the event the go authors change the internal structure of a map? reply rad_gruchalski 13 hours agorootparentNothing.

Thank you. replyhknmtt 8 hours agoprevI never understood this cost nonsense. TTL is the only thing that makes any sense to me. And implementation is trivial. All these caches are just a map underneath anyway, pointing to some data somewhere in memory. That&#x27;s about it. Not much else to it. reply klabb3 8 hours agoparentI don‚Äôt have any practical experience but if I were to guess it‚Äôs relatively easy for a developer to estimate a cost of retrieval in terms of CPU&#x2F;time or something, which can let the cache make smarter predictions about eviction depending on access patterns. Typically, a longer chained primary db call could be higher cost than say a quick lookup in a local kv store. That said, perhaps those should simply be different caches instead.TTL doesn‚Äôt say anything about eviction among objects that are still live, no? For that you need an eviction policy. reply hknmtt 6 hours agorootparent> TTL doesn‚Äôt say anything about eviction among objects that are still live, no?TTL IS eviction policy. You just store a timestamp along the value. When you access it, you check the timestamp and if it is stale, you delete it and return not found error(or whatever not found should return). And you have a simple bg worker that scans the cache periodically and deletes these stale entries to free up the memory.This is the basis for all caches. You can add cost on top of this as yet another eviction policy but that only adds another worker to scan the cache for items to purge and you have to store the cost along with the entry so you are increasing the each entry by at least 4 bytes, if we&#x27;re talking uint32. Not to mention that for this eviction policy, you need sorted cache because you need to know where the cut off for cost is.Walking the entire cache to purge expired TTL entries is one thing, but keeping ordered cache is a whole another thing. reply neonsunset 12 hours agoprev [‚Äì] You may want to vet this as a third-party dependency due to supply chain attack risks. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
