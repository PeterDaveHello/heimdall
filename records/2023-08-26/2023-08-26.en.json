    "originBody": "OpenTF Announces Fork of Terraform Posted on: August 25, 2023 Two weeks ago, HashiCorp announced they are changing the license to all their core products, including Terraform, to the Business Source License (BSL). In an attempt to keep Terraform open source, we published the OpenTF manifesto, and the community response was huge! Over 100 companies, 10 projects, and 400 individuals pledged their time and resources to keep Terraform open-source. The GitHub repository for the manifesto already has over 2.5k stars, and the number is growing quickly! The manifesto outlined the intent of the OpenTF initiative in two steps — the first was to appeal to HashiCorp to return Terraform to the community and revert the license change they were making for this project. The second, in case the license was not reverted, was to fork the Terraform project as OpenTF. The time is now! Since no reversal has been done, and no intent to do one has been communicated, we’re proud to announce that we have created a fork of Terraform called OpenTF. Many engineers across a number of companies, sometimes even competing companies, have been working together over the last week to make this possible. It’s been an incredible experience, really! As outlined in our manifesto, we are keeping OpenTF: Truly open source - under a well-known and widely-accepted license that companies can trust, that won't suddenly change in the future Community-driven - so that the community governs the project for the community, where pull requests are regularly reviewed and accepted on their merit and changes are proposed through a public RFC process Impartial - so that valuable features and fixes are accepted based on their value to the community, regardless of their impact on any particular vendor Layered and modular - with a programmer-friendly project structure to encourage building on top, enabling a new vibrant ecosystem of tools and integrations Backwards-compatible - so that the existing code can drive value for years to come Becoming part of a foundation We completed all documents required for OpenTF to become part of the Linux Foundation with the end goal of having OpenTF as part of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. By making a foundation responsible for the project, we will ensure the tool stays truly open-source and vendor-neutral. If Terraform wasn’t open-source from the beginning, many of the tools that you are using right now for your Terraform workflows simply wouldn’t exist, thus, we believe the future for Terraform is OpenTF, developed fully in the open. Roadmap As previously outlined, we’ve been working on this fork for a number of days already, with over 10 engineers across multiple companies working on it. In short, here’s the current status: Almost done with the repository-wide rename to OpenTF Selected initial steering committee members Performed initial adjustments and cleanup of community documents. Got CI/CD pipelines and multiple testing harnesses of end-to-end and snapshot tests to work and be green, to make sure that we stay backwards-compatible. Expect the repository to be published very soon, once we’re officially part of a foundation and have some basic community guardrails and processes in place. You might wonder why we already started work on this project so early? It’s quite simple, really. If HashiCorp were to reverse their decision, worst case we’d just lose a week of work. But if, and that is what indeed happened, HashiCorp wasn’t to reverse their decision, we didn’t want to lose any time, so that we could have a working OpenTF 1.6.0 release ready for you as soon as possible. And that’s why we started work on this over a week ago. In the spirit of being as open as possible, we’ve created a public repository tracking our progress towards important milestones. You can subscribe to the issues there to be notified as soon as the fork is public. If you have any questions, feel free to create additional issues on that repository - we’ll try to respond as quickly as possible. FAQ When will I be able to see the fork? We’re planning to publish the fork in the next 1-2 weeks. That doesn’t mean there will be a release by then, but the repository will be open. Releases (alpha and stable) should follow shortly. Will I be able to use OpenTF as a drop-in replacement for legacy Terraform? Yes Will OpenTF work with all the providers and modules Terraform works with? Yes What will be the first release of OpenTF? The first release will be 1.6.0-alpha, forked from the most recent commit that was still MPL-licensed. Who is maintaining OpenTF? Is there enough firepower behind the project? So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative. We expect this number to at least double in the following few weeks. To give you some perspective, Terraform was effectively maintained by about 5 FTEs from HashiCorp in the last 2 years. If you don’t believe us, look at their repository. How can I contribute to OpenTF? If you’d like to pledge resources as a company, please get in touch via email or PR on the manifesto repository. Otherwise, the best way to contribute right now is to spread the word! Once the repository is public and we have a contribution process in place, you’ll be able to do code contributions. Does OpenTF have a public roadmap? Can I affect it? You can find current public roadmap on this GitHub repository. We will put an RFC process in place for you to be able to contribute to the roadmap as soon as possible. Will OpenTF be compatible with future Terraform releases? OpenTF will be 100% interoperable with future Terraform releases until the community wishes otherwise. Can OpenTF change its licensing model in the future? Once OpenTF becomes part of the foundation, it’s governed by the foundation and the project community. Its licensing model cannot change.",

They could be focusing on the licence and their perception of Hashicorp, but instead there&#x27;s a lot of emphasis on the positive: getting up and running quickly, upcoming releases, public roadmap, and pledges of engineering work.In the long run few will care about this licencing change (as much as they should!) – business users will accept it, individuals won&#x27;t take any notice, and competitors would get mired in issues as expected. Basically a win for Hashicorp.But winning on positive changes beats licencing issues. Business users will go where the centre of gravity in the ecosystem is, individuals will too, and will prefer free (in both senses) solutions, and competitors will push this hard to all their customers. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see Hashicorp needing to build OpenTF support into their products to remain compatible.> So far, four companies pledged the equivalent of 14 full-time engineers (FTEs) to the OpenTF initiative.

Most of us would&#x27;ve never agreed to the CLA to contribute to the project if it was BUSL licensed. Taking all those contributions and all that community trust, and then changing to the BUSL license is a bait and switch.\" [1]I agree with the overall sentiment, but they could&#x27;ve left out all the judging side comments.[1] Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentf.org&#x2F;#why-fork reply wokwokwok 9 hours agorootparentOh come now, that’s a stretch.In the announcement literally the only mention of this is:> The manifesto outlined the intent of the OpenTF initiative in two steps — the first was to appeal to HashiCorp to return Terraform to the community and revert the license change they were making for this project.

To build on this comment, we&#x27;ve tried to intentionally focus on positively meeting our needs, not on negatively villifying another company for trying to meet their needs. You can see a good example of this in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;opentffoundation&#x2F;manifesto&#x2F;issues&#x2F;165#iss....We do not fault HashiCorp for trying to build a thriving business and we respect their amazing achievements and contributions. However, on this one issue of the Terraform license, we do not agree with their position and believe strongly in the need for a truly open source, community-driven Terraform. reply JellyBeanThief 2 hours agorootparentMan, you guys should give a masterclass on launching open-source forks with professionalism and positivity. reply osigurdson 3 hours agorootparentprevCan anyone fork and change the license? I assume yes if originally MIT or similar.I wish it were not the case. It should be more like contributors get paid like employees retroactively in a situation like this but no idea how something could be structured like this. reply Xylakant 41 minutes agorootparentStrictly speaking, no. MIT does not give you permissions to change the license. But you can incorporate MIT licensed code into a project that contains code that is under a different license of your choice, open or closed source for a nearly identical effect.So you can just license all future contributions under AGPL and use the MIT licensed code, effectively making the combined work AGPL. But the MIT part remains MIT, anyone could fork your project, remove all AGPL code and return to MIT. It’s wise to clearly mark which code is which, especially since MIT requires that the copyright notice must be retained:> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software. reply jen20 15 hours agorootparentprev> \"HashiCorp even had all contributors sign a CLAOf course, this is untrue. They may have had all contributors after some specific date sign one, but it is simply untrue that all contributors have signed one at all. reply mattl 14 hours agorootparentHow did they relicense without one? reply Jka9rhnDJos 3 hours agorootparentRemove the code from the repo, put it in another repo, probably. I don’t remember signing a CLA 7 years ago, but somehow they relicensed without me needing to agree. All my code was pulled out into a separate package&#x2F;plugin that is still MIT. reply jen20 14 hours agorootparentprevThey did not relicense.All HashiCorp have done is made their own future contributions subject to BSL, not relicensed any previous contribution, nor do they have the ability to do that without copyright assignment of each and every contribution, which they do not have (specifically I have never signed a copyright assignment, and nor has at least one other of the top ten contributors of all time).Nothing about MPLv2 prevents inclusion in a commercial product provided the attribution and file-based copyleft provisions are followed. reply pxc 12 hours agorootparent> All HashiCorp have done is made their own future contributions subject to BSL, not relicensed any previous contribution,There&#x27;s are only 2 .go files left in the hashicorp&#x2F;terraform repo on GitHub which still have MPL-2.0 in their license headers, so either there are virtually no such contributions left in Terraform or they have in fact attempted to relicense code.This looks like relicensing to me: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;hashicorp&#x2F;terraform&#x2F;commit&#x2F;53c34ff49cfbc1...Btw, no .go file that you still show up in `git blame` for has an MPL notice header. reply chris_wot 11 hours agorootparentThe LibreOffice project faced a similar dilemma and have carefully kept the old licenses in their files, and new license in new code in new files. reply asddubs 3 hours agorootparentwhat license did they change to&#x2F;from? reply jen20 12 hours agorootparentprevI will follow up on that, it was not the case even quite recently. If they really have rewritten all code, then great - I have no problem with this! reply pxc 12 hours agorootparentReplacing code whose license you don&#x27;t want is definitely a fair-and-square way to manage a project and change the overall terms under which you can distribute it. (As it happens, that tactic is often essential to efforts to open-source formerly proprietary projects, too.) reply therealpygon 6 hours agorootparent*Provided that the replacement is not simply a rewritten version of the same code that achieves the same result through overwhelmingly similar methodology. reply jolux 5 hours agorootparentThe function of code is explicitly not protected by copyright and the breadth of this exemption was clarified and expanded by Google vs Oracle. replyfoota 13 hours agorootparentprevIs that something you can do? I wouldn&#x27;t have thought there previous license would be compatible with the BSL, and so distributing the software under the BSL wouldn&#x27;t be possible? reply jaggederest 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s standard for BSD and MIT style licenses and similar to just require the copyright notice be retained in e.g. a LICENSE file or equivalent.A bunch of commercial software right now (cough I&#x27;m writing this on MacOS) uses BSD-licensed foundations. reply jen20 12 hours agorootparentMPLv2 is file-based copyleft, and there are no restrictions on including it in a commercial work provided that changes to MPLv2-licensed files are accessible per the terms.Indeed it’s something of a spiritual successor to CDDL which was designed precisely for that purpose (although reliable sources also say it was designed to be GPL-incompatible, so that is literally a he-said&#x2F;she-said case). reply fishnchips 14 hours agorootparentprevHow indeed. reply jen20 14 hours agorootparentDirectly answered by [1].[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37266016 reply fishnchips 12 hours agorootparentAnswered incorrectly. All the code is relicensed with BUSL header on each and every file. reply jeremyjh 11 hours agorootparentChanging the license in the repo does not change the license of files you have already distributed under the MPL. That would require them to revoke all those licenses, which they can&#x27;t do under the terms of that license that they&#x27;ve already agreed to. This entire thread and OpenTF, and maybe all of OSS itself would probably not exist if that were not the case.In the official repo I can still check out an older commit with the MPL on it, which means they are still distributing code under that license, but it wouldn&#x27;t matter if that were the case or not under the law.edit: In fact, software as a business ( and many other professions ) would not exist if license terms could be changed or revoked after distribution. License changes for new software to be distributed can change, sure. But short of a breach of contract as outlined in the license itself you cannot change a license you have granted. reply jacoblambda 9 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not what they mean. They went through every file in the repository and updated the license to BUSL from MPL.Unless they have approval from each contributor for a given file (or the contributor signed a CTA or CLA), they cannot re-license that particular file.It&#x27;s still MPL and only once all contributors approve or the MPL code is removed can it be re-licensed to an incompatible license.Of course if they had wanted to move to a compatible license, for a lot of FOSS licenses that is an option. Regardless of whether that is an option for the MPL, they are moving to an incompatible license and could not do this.----So their only options for files that they can&#x27;t convert to the BUSL from the MPL are:1. Keep contributions to those files under the MPL but require contributors to sign a CTA or CLA guaranteeing those contributions can later be relicensed.2. Move BUSL contributions out of the file and only keep the MPL contributions in that file until they&#x27;ve all been replaced.Doing otherwise is violating the MPL. reply jen20 12 hours agorootparentprevAgain, wrong. Whether that has been done is independent of whether that is permissible, based on copyright assignment. reply fishnchips 11 hours agorootparentAre you implying they had no right to do that? reply jacoblambda 8 hours agorootparentStrictly speaking it is on Hashicorp to prove that they had the right to re-license the code. Which would require listing all contributors and whether a given contributor gave written agreement to re-license the code or whether they had signed a CTA or CLA.To my knowledge they have not done that so anybody whose code is being used without permission could fight them on copyright infringement.And worth noting is that they don&#x27;t have a particularly small number of contributors. Terraform has over 1700 contributors and many of the other repos have over 1000 contributors or close to 1000 contributors (unsure of the overlap).If they only started requiring a CLA or CTA later into their development, they probably haven&#x27;t gotten permission from all the rights holders. replyrobertlagrant 15 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s support from companies who make money from Terraform being free, and at least one looked like a direct Terraform Cloud competitor that probably hurt Hashicorp&#x27;s chances of making Terraform profitable.It makes sense they&#x27;d do this, but we need to stop loving people who appear to give us things. They&#x27;re just making reasonable business decisions. reply prepend 14 hours agorootparentI prefer reasonable business decisions that support open source software over companies baiting and switching.If Hashicorp didn’t have a business plan that made money off terraform being OSS then the time for that was years ago.If you release as OSS then your competitors will use it to. This is predictable and all plans should account for it.This competition didn’t hurt Hashicorps chances of profitability, they were factored in from the beginning. reply pxc 12 hours agorootparent> This competition didn’t hurt Hashicorps chances of profitability, they were factored in from the beginning.They weren&#x27;t, actually.From a Hashicorp FAQ article (which is a transcript of a video interview which has since been delisted from YouTube) titled &#x27;Why is HashiCorp committed to open source?&#x27;:> Mitchell: [I]t&#x27;s always sort of been a default for me.

Them being irresponsible early on is negative for the community.Cynically, I believe they intentionally were stupid knowing that their tool would only become widely used if open source (who wants infrastructure as code locked into some proprietary thing). reply pxc 8 hours agorootparentOne of the things that comes through for me in that FAQ, Mitchell&#x27;s story about learning to code by reading and playing with open-source projects, and Armon&#x27;s assertion that this license change is continuous with the company&#x27;s original &#x27;open-source ethos&#x27; is that this has always really been more about &#x27;source availability&#x27; for them— I think they&#x27;re credible, in way.I still think of open-source in a traditional, historically informed way: &#x27;open-source&#x27; is about software freedom at bottom, even though its name and common arguments in its favor are more practical and self-interested.I get the impression that Mitchell Hashimoto never saw it that way, and certainly didn&#x27;t buy into the actual &#x27;open-source ethos&#x27; in the sense of the values of the people who decided the term and founded OSI, etc.A source-available license like BUSL probably would have been a better fit for HashiCorp from the start, or as near the start as possible. But I don&#x27;t know that &#x27;source-available&#x27; as a label could have driven adoption the same way in the early days, and it seems plausible to me that the founders might&#x27;ve realized that too. reply louzell 13 hours agorootparentprevI mean, businesses change? The founders didn&#x27;t have a crystal ball to see how every decision would play out.Reading through these comments, I&#x27;m reminded of a pop psychology book that I read that essentially said \"never try to take someone away, no matter how small, it is perceived as a much larger loss than it is\".If Hashicorp had started with this new license in the first place, do we really think they wouldn&#x27;t have had the business success that they&#x27;ve had? We&#x27;ll never know, but my guess is that a license that says \"competitors can&#x27;t copy us\" would seem totally reasonable to folks contributing, and irrelevant to customers that have a problem to solve. Someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong here, I want to understand this obviously passionate response.(Since I&#x27;ve commented a couple times on this let me also say I&#x27;m not a hashicorp employee nor know anyone there) reply hodgesrm 8 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;m reminded of a pop psychology book that I read that essentially said \"never try to take someone away, no matter how small, it is perceived as a much larger loss than it is\".That&#x27;s not just pop psychology.

I mean there is a reason why a lot of projects start out with a different license and only change to BSL once a certain level of popularity is achieved, right? reply rbanffy 8 hours agorootparentAs a possible contributor, and with all things being equal (which, really, never happens), I&#x27;d prefer a GPL-based product to have my time over a BSD&#x2F;MIT license, because I really want my work to remain free. A BSL-based product would have to be very important to me to make it worth for me to dedicate time to it.In reality, the usefulness of the product and friendliness towards developers is much more important. reply prepend 8 hours agorootparentprevDo you think crack dealers change their mind and suddenly discover they can’t make money off free crack?

Also important to mention another and probably a more important key member in the OpenTF initiative - Gruntwork, creators of Terragrunt and Terratest.

There&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, but I don&#x27;t like the mischaracterisation of HashiCorp as the baddies and this new entity as the goodies.

If you are looking for the most customized approach, the Linux Foundation (LF) is probably the most customizable as they have build hundreds of entities that many people may not think of being part of the LF... CNCF... GraphQL Foundation... R Consortium... OpenJS Foundation... Overture Maps Foundation... LF is really \"foundation as a service\" and they are best at ecosystem building from my biased perspective.There are other foundations out there with their own advantages...

And it’s not clear it’s a mistake yet.(I work for red hat but this is my personal opinion). reply richardfontana 15 hours agorootparentAlso FWIW Red Hat license policy (as implemented publicly through Fedora) disallows software under the Business Source License: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitlab.com&#x2F;fedora&#x2F;legal&#x2F;fedora-license-data&#x2F;-&#x2F;blob&#x2F;m...

Are you removing this functionality because it&#x27;s no longer FOSS or fears around the BSL verbiage? reply richardfontana 15 hours agorootparentSince Red Hat is at the earliest stages of grappling with this issue and I can&#x27;t speak for the teams involved I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything I can say, other than that our corporate policies on product licensing by default do not allow stuff under licenses like BUSL-1.1. The only case I am aware of offhand where Red Hat briefly had a &#x27;source available&#x27; license in a product concerned some code that was transferred from IBM to Red Hat (the source available component was third party with respect to both IBM and Red Hat; IBM does not or at least did not have the same restrictions on use of such licenses that Red Hat has).Just speaking personally, I&#x27;m happy to see this fork occurring and hope they succeed in joining CNCF. reply bonzini 15 hours agorootparentprev[not the parent]For sure it will not update to BUSL-licensed versions of Terraform as mentioned above, but I can&#x27;t say if it will stay on an older version, use OpenTF, use Ansible or something else. reply benterix 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, they clearly alienated themselves from the community, or a significant part of it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a mistake from a business perspective but early leaders of Red Hat were very careful to collaborate with the community. reply bayindirh 14 hours agorootparentI can say that, the scientific computing community has been affected deeply because of this move. They wanted to eliminate \"The Freeloaders\", but the collateral damage was enormous, and they either didn&#x27;t see or don&#x27;t want to see what they have done.The thing is, the big majority of these systems won&#x27;t flock to RedHat, and won&#x27;t continue to use CentOS. reply JeremyNT 14 hours agorootparentYeah a large portion of research computing standardized on Red Hat (see e.g. Scientific Linux). The stability is quite important when trying to run ancient&#x2F;niche scientific code that sometimes would only support (or even build on) Red Hat, and when you have a large number of nodes that need to be essentially bug-for-bug identical you want the package churn and update cycle to be kept to an absolute minimum.The licensing of real RHEL never could have made sense in the HPC space, and I&#x27;d be shocked if a meaningful number of deployments would be moved to purchase RHEL now.When I was a \"sysadmin\" in this space I always kind of personally preferred Debian, which has similar longevity to its release cycle, but it could never gain much traction.I hope at this current juncture the HPC community might rethink its investment in the RHAT ecosystem and give Debian a chance. reply pxc 10 hours agorootparent> a large portion of research computing standardized on Red Hat (see e.g. Scientific Linux).

For example, IBM has moved away from using CLAs for its open source projects, I believe mainly out of a desire to follow Red Hat&#x27;s example. I&#x27;m not aware of any use of copyright assignment by IBM projects. reply skrebbel 15 hours agorootparentprevYour comment dances around the point so avidly that it’s un-understandable to me.

What&#x27;s always been confusing to me about Hashicorp&#x27;s change and any subsequent relicense of OpenTF is that I know for a fact not everyone who contributed code to Terraform signed the CLA and allowed permission to relicense.I suspect if OpenTF tries to relicense to a more permissive license like Apache 2 (rather than less in the case of BSL) license we might see some fireworks. reply tedivm 16 hours agorootparentThe CNCF has made exceptions on their license policy before, specifically for MPL based software.

FWIW I would not hesitate to support such a request for a policy exception. reply bcantrill 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s great to hear. We at Oxide are huge fans of the MPLv2 and it&#x27;s our default license for everything; I think it&#x27;s reasonable that the default expectation for CNCF is Apache 2.0, but would love for MPLv2 to also be considered a first-class license! reply _msw_ 14 hours agorootparentprevIn my personal opinion, there&#x27;s no good reason to have a license policy at the CNCF, or any Linux Foundation directed fund, that makes using copyleft licenses so burdensome, especially when they are as \"weak\" as MPL 2.0 is.I know that there are Reasons.

Usually, I think they didn&#x27;t even actually change the licenses.In every case I can remember, the community-centric forks outpaced or altogether outlived them. Hudson is dead. OpenOffice is basically irrelevant. Oracle ZFS sees little interest and is not what anyone thinks of when they hear &#x27;ZFS&#x27;. But Jenkins, LibreOffice, and OpenZFS are all going strong many years later.This could end up being a really good thing for Terraform users, would-be contributors, and Terraform itself as a technology.

Just changing the release process or removing some community maintainers&#x27; commit bits or whatever could be enough.Maybe some of that was because seeing what was done to OpenSolaris made everyone else ready to jump right away as soon as they saw any shift at all in other projects, though. reply bcantrill 16 hours agorootparentTotally agreed -- and thank you for bringing up Hudson, which I have been concerned is being broadly forgotten! reply rbanffy 8 hours agorootparentI prefer to focus my imagination on picturing how angry Larry must have felt after becoming the owner of MySQL and learning that, even after spending a couple bullions on it, he still couldn&#x27;t kill the thing.And I always forget Hudson&#x27;s name, but not the product. reply eYrKEC2 13 hours agorootparentprevFirst time caller, long time listener:You have a blog too!

I ran Linux at home and used free software everywhere I could. I even eschewed Times New Roman in favor of Linux Libertine (then the font of the W in the Wikipedia logo!) for my school essays because I didn&#x27;t want to support the hegemony of a proprietary typeface.What I did understand about Sun was that they had been the caretakers (and sometimes creators) of some of the most important and beloved technology I&#x27;d ever used. I didn&#x27;t know anything about Solaris, Hudson, ZFS or SPARC, but I knew Sun for VirtualBox, OpenOffice, the MySQL database system that seemed to be everywhere in the open-source world, and the Java programming language I was writing in for school.I remember a sense that something precious had died with that buyout, even though I didn&#x27;t understand what led up to it. I worried a lot about OpenOffice, which I relied on and advocated to friends, and I practically cheered when I read about the formation of The Document Foundation and LibreOffice. reply cryptonector 15 hours agorootparentprevYes. Sun became all about extracting rents from vendor lock-in (SPARC, J2ME, SUN DS, etc.). But Sun couldn&#x27;t maintain that vendor lock-in, so Sun went under. Management just did not or would not see this, much less act on it. OpenSolaris was a good initiative for rebuilding mind-share, but it was a bit too little too late.But the biggest mistakes Sun made were made in 2002-2004, and they never recovered: - the Solaris on x86 \"cancellation\" (it was more putting it on hold, maybe, but the market took it as a cancellation) - not making a deal with Google for Google to use Solaris in their data centers - killing off Sun PS (professions services)The Solaris on x86 \"cancellation\" killed a lot of mind-share. No one wanted to get locked-in to SPARC.Making a deal with Google would have reinvigorated Solaris&#x27; mind-share at a critical time.IBM did the opposite of killing off its professional services division. IBM killed off their x86 systems division and beefed up its PS, and IBM went on to make a killing on PS.The vendor lock-in issues totally compounded these terrible decisions.After 2002 Sun was always on the back foot. reply znpy 13 hours agorootparent> not making a deal with Google for Google to use Solaris in their data centersWow i had no idea that had almost happened!Anyone care to elaborate further on that?I wonder what could have been, if later solaris was open sourced and google could push their improvements… maybe we’d all be running containers based on solaris zones, and would have solaris on our smartphones?

Their value is that you don&#x27;t have to implement these nice integrations yourself in e.g. Jenkins.So replace Spacelift with Jenkins.

Also important to mention another and probably a more important key member in the OpenTF initiative - Gruntwork, creators of Terragrunt and Terratest.

None of Spacelift is OSS, for example.I’m not claiming it’s not the same monetization model, but with endless talk from these companies about the commitment to OSS and the virtues of OSS and the benefits HashiCorp has and would continue to receive by keeping their code OSS - it’s just ironic to see most of these companies have no open source code and aren’t actually willing to commit to an OSS model. reply stephenr 5 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m familiar with the other companies&#x2F;their tools but I assume they&#x27;re all somewhat nebulous to terraform - did they not try to contribute back to hashicorp terraform?In the TF scenario specifically it seems like it would have been smarter for hashicorp to open the core oss project to some outside contributors more directly (potentially moving to a different \"ownership\" on GH).Maybe they&#x27;ll relent and throw support behind the new project.

Simply don&#x27;t even consider them. reply bornfreddy 13 hours agorootparentprevThank you for correcting me!Two sources (mariadb and fossa.com) claim that by BSL any production use requires a different (commercial) licence, while HashiCorp&#x27;s explanation [0] indeed tells that there is no change except for those providing competitive offerings (I&#x27;ll take their word for it). Which seems... more than fair? Not sure what the uproar is about either, if anything, I understand (and support) HashiCorp. Too bad about the split though.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hashicorp.com&#x2F;license-faq reply BarryMilo 13 hours agorootparentThe uproar is that people and coompanies contributed to the project without compensation, and are just now being told Hashicorp has altered the deal... unilaterally.I for one would not have built my infra on non-free software, and I will certainly avoid it now. reply znpy 12 hours agorootparent> unilaterallyPosting again because this is also misleading: if you sign a DCO (developer certificate of agreement) and CLA (contributor license agreement) you are almost often (it not always) signing away the copyright of your work.In doing so, the receiving party is legitimised to to anything, including changing the license of all sources (including your contribution).If that’s not okay with you then you should not sign that CLAs. If you signed stuff without reading them… it’s your fault.I’ll said this in the past and I’ll say this again: this whole scenario could have been prevented by using a free software license like the AGPL. Which is what Grafana Labs did, and last time I checked Grafana (the company) is doing just fine. reply Jka9rhnDJos 2 hours agorootparentThis all reeks of “Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.” Encourage the community contribute and use your project, help them setup and become integrated with custom extensions and plugins, then rip the rug out from under them and make them pay or else destroy their business.I don’t remember ever being asked to sign a CLA back in 2016 when I contributed. But they moved my code out to a plugin which was kept MIT. That code was there in the core product for 5+ years while they were building their business. My contributions helped them build their business, and in turn, I used their contributions to help the companies I was working for.They broke the covenant of OSS: You make your source open and MIT license it, you are giving it to the community to let them do what they will. That’s what the license says. But, in turn, you get hundreds of thousands of people contributing back, for free. Hashi puts in to it, the community puts in to it, and we all make a great tool. We send back bug fixes and write training blogs, etc., and they don’t tell us what to do with the project because they’re getting a lot out of the community anyways.Hundreds of millions of people every day depend on OpenSSL, but how many people have contributed to maintaining it? How much of the web we use every day depends on ffmpeg, yet I don’t know anyone who has contributed to that project. Many tens of thousands haved blogged and promoted Terraform (et. al.) for free? Many thousands more gave talks and training, without any compensation from Hashicorp. The naysayers act like Hashicorp has provided everything to the OSS community and gotten nothing back.- Terraform is written in Golang and utilizes gRPC to communicate between plugins and core. What if Google decided to re-license Go and gRPC and say that Terraform couldn’t use it because it was a competitor to Cloud Deployment Manager or that Nomad and Consul are competitors to GKE? It’s all up to the license holders to decide who’s a competitor and tell them they can’t do that anymore. - Hashicorp uses Lets Encrypt for their certificate authority for their website. Have they contributed back to that project, either monetarily or in dev time? Or do they just get free certificates for all their websites automatically provisioned from a public certificate authority supported and managed by other companies?AGPL has nothing to do with it. Hashicorp wants all the contributions and bug fixes and blog posts and talks and marketing and promotion and support and training, for free, and also wants to be the only one to benefit. They should have never MIT licensed the code 8 years. reply BarryMilo 8 hours agorootparentprevLegalized yes, legitimized, certainly not. This is not a copyright issue, this is a loyalty issue: Betraying the people who helped you get where you are is the kind of move a company makes when they no longer care to be perceived as ethical. This is not an important factor for everyone, but it&#x27;s usually a pretty big deal in the open source world. reply znpy 12 hours agorootparentprevAre you sure the MPL is free software?Last time I checked, debian had to provide a forked version of firefox and thunderbird because their license (the MPL) wasn’t free enough. reply xorcist 12 hours agorootparentYes, the MPL is free software.The FSF explicitly says so on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;licenses&#x2F;license-list.html and the Mozilla project developed the license with the intent of it being used in other free software projects. The important difference is in its limited grant on patents.The reason Debian avoids distributing Firefox is not because of copyright licenses but because Mozilla vigorously protects their trademarks, including \"Firefox\" and the various logotypes. You are not allowed to distribute them without permission, which Debian largely wants to avoid to have in order to not set a precedent which would impact further distribution of Debian and its derivatives.Mozilla does this to avoid the risk of third parties offering Firefox with spyware-like modifications. One might ask why Debian itself do not seem to suffer the same problems. It seems like a problem mostly on proprietary software distribution platforms in practice, but it&#x27;s certainly a possibility. reply eitland 12 hours agorootparentprevThat was not about the license of the code I think.The code for IceWeasel is still MPL, only they have changed the artworks and names that are trademarked or otherwise protected by Mozilla. reply kpgalligan2 11 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m amazed and a bit dismayed by the general vibe in the comments.I&#x27;ll preface this with I don&#x27;t know anything about Terraform, OpenTF, HashiCorp, etc. I couldn&#x27;t even guess what Terraform is. I&#x27;m in mobile dev. However, I work on open source a lot and think about sustainability and revenue streams quite a bit.I read the manifesto. I saw the \"revert the license or we&#x27;ll fork\". What I didn&#x27;t see is any form of trying to work with HashiCorp on their goals. It seems like very considerable resources have been pulled together to fork, but I didn&#x27;t see the part where anything remotely like that level of effort and resources was on offer to HashiCorp to rethink the plan and come up with a better answer.As I understand it (which is based off of some comments. See above about not knowing anything about this), a good chunk of the resources are actually from competitors. If true, it takes a lot of the sting out of the \"HashiCorp are jerks\" argument. I mean, I&#x27;m not saying they&#x27;re not, but it&#x27;s more like, \"HashiCorp changed the license so they could push back on competition, so the competition forked the code\". I don&#x27;t really expect \"right and wrong\" from companies, or open source for that matter. But the spin and vibe feel a little misdirected.I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong. Building up a community who contributes, then doing a rug pull, sucks. However, the \"company does a risky thing and builds this awesome tool, then a bunch of others fast follow and exploit it\" has become very common, and it is going to be a bad thing in the long run. You can say \"We believe that the essential building blocks of the modern Internet, such as Linux, Kubernetes, and Terraform need to be truly open source\", but to be fair, Terraform was not an essential building block until somebody built it.As much as license rug-pulls damage user&#x2F;community investment, fast-follow competition and the threat of forking will ensure far less investment in the very kind of open source everybody wants.There is a financial sustainability problem involved in \"big open source\", and we are seeing the changes. In many ways, it simply has to happen. Going forward, I do hope new products like this start with a license that works rather than changing, as that is obviously not appreciated, but many devs reflexively avoid that kind of arrangement, even if it costs nothing to use.Anyway, just thinking out loud. Hashicorp might be run psychopaths. I have no idea. In a general sense, though, the whole industry is going to need some new models. If it&#x27;s just \"fully open source or nothing!\", there&#x27;s a whole class of tools that won&#x27;t exist. Building things is risky and expensive. I don&#x27;t want to go back to when everything was closed source and needed a license, but open source without a reasonably protectable revenue model will definitely limit what gets built and why. And as we like to say, \"if you&#x27;re not the customer, maybe you&#x27;re the product\", or something like that :) reply fishnchips 11 hours agorootparent> offer to HashiCorpNot sure about others but at Spacelift we tried to partner with Hashi, especially that ours is a higher level platform that connects various tools (eg.

My attempts to submit Pull Requests for much wanted features (fully working documentation with new integration tests all passing) often took months-a year to be accepted and merged.Hashicorp engineers were incentivized to work on features related to Hashicorp paid services, and Hashicorp competitors who would similarly benefit from a stronger Terraform codebase were disincentivized from potentially helping Hashicorp. reply tpmx 13 hours agoparentAgreed.

Will it pull from HashiCorps servers, or will it spin up its own plugin registry? If the latter, will the existing plugins be mirrored? reply fishnchips 18 hours agoparentNo immediate change with regards to how the plugins are handled. Longer term I think the entire plugin ecosystem could benefit from less centralized control, in the interest of all other projects that depend on it (eg. Pulumi, Crossplane etc). As OpenTF we are already working with other parties interested in keeping the ecosystem in good shape. But for now there&#x27;s no change necessary, since the TF registry seems itself to just be a lightweight proxy to GitHub Packages, they don&#x27;t seem to host anything themselves.(Marcin, co-founder of Spacelift, and one of the members of the OpenTF initiative) reply janosdebugs 18 hours agorootparentI think this should be addressed sooner rather than later. A lot of core plugins (e.g. AWS) are written by HashiCorp themselves and the license could be changed at any time, putting OpenTF users in danger of violating the license. Furthermore, to publish a provider one needs a HashiCorp account and agree to their Terms of Service. reply wlonkly 17 hours agorootparentI was under the impression that a lot of the cloud provider plugins were developed in close collaboration with, or even by, the cloud providers themselves.At a glance, three of the top four contributors to the AWS provider are from outside of Hashicorp, and two of those three are AWS employees. reply janosdebugs 17 hours agorootparentYou may be right on that one, but they still have copyright headers like this: # Copyright (c) HashiCorp, Inc. # SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0This is enforced by a GitHub Actions check on every PR. reply fishnchips 17 hours agorootparentprev> agree to their Terms of ServiceThanks for the insight.

Governance is always one of the harder problems when setting up a project. Maybe the CNCF could actually help already, given the high profile nature of Terraform?

Every open source project should make its contributors sign CLAs, and you should be wary of using one that doesn&#x27;t. Why? Because any single contributor can claim at any point in the future that the project is using their code illegally, and that you&#x2F;your company should pay them for using their proprietary IP for all of these years. Can you prove that you audited every single line in the project you used and were sure of its copyright status? A CLA ensures exactly that. There&#x27;s a reason why Linux Foundation, Apache, CNCF, Mozilla, heck even FSF all have strict CLA requirements.Relicensing is a completely separate conversation, and there are plenty of open source CLAs which don&#x27;t have that provision. reply unmole 17 hours agorootparent> Because any single contributor can claim at any point in the future that the project is using their code illegallySo, you&#x27;ve never heard of a Developer Certificate of Origin?

The DCO is just a statement and does not permit the receiving organization to distribute under incompatible licensing terms. reply paxys 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sure some organization can write a \"DCO\" which says the exact same thing.

I&#x27;m just talking about the theoretical impacts.

Did I not copy it elsewhere? Do I have the rights to give this to you, and you sign off on?’ It’s been a very successful model played out in the kernel and many other ecosystems. I’m generally not really supportive of having CLAs unless there’s a real strict business need.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opensource.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;20&#x2F;2&#x2F;open-source-projects-gov... reply caniszczyk 3 hours agorootparentFYI 99% of CNCF projects use DCO, only a handful still use CLA but we give projects a CHOICE in the matter.

Why underlying license is not enough? reply koolba 17 hours agorootparentIf there’s no intention of ever changing the license, then there is no need for a CLA.A CLA is required when the repo owner wants the ability to change the license down the road without contacting N contributors. reply n42 17 hours agorootparentyes, but it&#x27;s not always malicious. one example is to dual license the code. for example, Qt is available under GPL (LGPL?) and has a CLA that allows them to commercially license your contributions to businesses.a good CLA in this instance would guarantee you that your code cannot be relicensed exclusively away from GPL. the software is still free as in freedom, but the organization can fund itself by courting businesses that would not touch GPL software. reply lars_francke 17 hours agorootparentAnother example is OpenStreetMap which changed its license because we learned that the old one wasn&#x27;t adequate for the purpose intended.We have no idea how today&#x27;s licenses will be challenged in the future and I believe it&#x27;s a good practice to keep a door open to being able to change the license going forward.That it&#x27;s not done maliciously is a purpose for foundations which serve as trust anchors. reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentthat&#x27;s an interesting point, thanks.I&#x27;m still skeptical of a CLA for such a project since a ton (currently all) of the copyright is held by Hashicorp meaning they would have to consent to the future license change as well, regardless of the CLA or foundation membership. In general I think that makes a point for a CLA, but in this case I don&#x27;t think it does. reply riku_iki 14 hours agorootparentprev> Qt is available under GPL (LGPL?) and has a CLA that allows them to commercially license your contributions to businesses.but that&#x27;s exactly the case which happened in case of Hashi, so CLA allowed them to continue working on commercial product only, with all 3p contributions being under their proprietary license. reply detaro 14 hours agorootparentQt&#x27;s situation is different, since they have contractual obligations to continue releasing under (L)GPL - failure to do so allows the KDE Project to release Qt under MIT. reply jen20 17 hours agorootparentprevA CLA is not required for that. A copyright assignment is. A CLA is not necessarily a copyright assignment, and a copyright assignment is not necessarily a CLA. reply fishnchips 18 hours agoparentprevIdeally we would want to let people contribute freely without the need to sign anything extra. However, for the exact process we will defer to the Linux Foundation &#x2F; CNCF. The ultimate goal is to ensure that a rug pull like this is never allowed to happen again.(Marcin here, co-founder of Spacelift, one of the members of the OpenTF initiative) reply janosdebugs 18 hours agoparentprevIf they aim for making it a CNCF project, it may very well be a simple inbound=outbound licensing (everyone keeps their copyrights). The CNCF gives projects two options: DCO or CLA, where the CLA is a very simple formality. It being a foundation and not a for-profit company already makes licensing shenanigans unlikely. reply arusahni 18 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;ve already got more FTEs on this than Amazon seemingly put on OpenSearch. reply paxys 18 hours agorootparentCompanies saying \"we will let some FTEs contribute to this project along with their regular work\" is very different from Amazon paying a dedicated team to work on it full time. reply fishnchips 18 hours agorootparentMarcin here, co-founder of Spacelift, one of the members of the OpenTF initiativeWe provided a dedicated team on a temporary basis. Once the project is in the foundation, we will make a financial contribution, with which dedicated developers will be funded.

Game Merch Blog Support Friday Facts #373 - Factorio: Space Age Posted by kovarex, Earendel on 2023-08-25 Hello, long time no see! Today we are going to talk about the expansion which is called Factorio: Space Age. (Click here for static image version) What is Factorio: Space Age?kovarex Factorio: Space Age continues the player's journey after launching rockets into space. Discover new worlds with unique challenges, exploit their novel resources for advanced technological gains, and manage your fleet of interplanetary space platforms. Vanilla Factorio ends by launching the rocket into space, so I always expected it to be quite obvious what we are going to do next. Honestly the space platform related gameplay was actually planned a very long time ago, and we had shown a little bit in FFF-74. We had a similar kind of story with the Spidertron. Its concept was teased for the first time in FFF-120, just to be quietly abandoned and then revived 4 years later. But as you might or might not know, the name 'WUBE' is an abbreviation of Wszystko będzie, which means something like \"Everything will be done eventually\". We didn't abandon the plan, we just realized it would be way too ambitious to try to fit it into the 1.0 Factorio release, so it was eventually just postponed to the expansion. In retrospect, it was clearly a good idea. The main structure Instead of sending one rocket to space, you have to send many, because you need to use them to transport materials to build big space platforms in orbit. The rocket is cheaper in Space Age to not make it drag forever, but you still are expected to build bigger in preparation of what is to come. The space platforms are used on their own to generate space science, but mainly, they are eventually used to travel to different planets, and for automated interplanetary logistics. We decided to go with the approach of having a small number of predefined planets, which represent your progression through the game. The expansion contains 4 additional planets. Each of which has its own unique theme, resource, challenges and gameplay mechanics. Most of them also have different military targets. Every planet leads to production of specific science packs and its technologies. The order in which you exploit the planets is an impactful strategic choice. The rewards Since we have a lot of new challenges, we also had to balance the set of rewards you get for each stage of the game. We have a set of cool new things in the expansion, but the player is quite omnipotent at the end of the vanila playthrough so we had to make some tough decisions. Since the goal was to make the overall expansion experience as good as possible, we have rebalanced the tech tree. This means, that with Space Age enabled, some items that are available in vanilla are unlocked later on some planet. This specifically applies to artillery, cliff explosives (this is the masochist part of me speaking), Spidertron, best tier of modules, and some personal equipment upgrades. Based on testing, these changes made the choice of where and when to go even more meaningful. On the other hand, space will be available sooner and there will be some nice additions available directly on Nauvis (the vanilla planet). This implies that technically, you could just take your vanilla base, activate the expansion, and continue playing. But the best way to experience it will be to play with Space Age from start to finish. Version 2.0 is not just about the expansion In the previous news about the expansion FFF-367, we declared that the content will be technically a mod taking advantage of the updated engine. What this means is that a lot of the improvements will be for all players, regardless of them having the expansion or not. Examples of things that will be in the 2.0 update are: the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and many more. It will all be covered in more details in future FFFs. The good news and the bad newskovarex Lets start with the (probably) bad news. Since we know where we are and what is the goal, we can start to approximate the date of releasing the expansion, which is planned to be about one year from now. It is still a long time, but at least it is getting more specific. Current state In the previous post FFF-367, we declared a 7 step plan, where we were at step 4. Now we are at the end of step 5, and have started some things from step 6 already. It has been playable from start to finish for more than a year. This means that we have already made several improvement iterations based on the playthroughs behind us. We are doing 3 types of testing which were all very useful: Just playing the game on our own and contemplating how it feels. Office LAN party, which is also a great way to test multiplayer. Individual testers. We had a few outside testers who played it from start to finish and gave us detailed feedback. The feedback led us to make different kinds of changes, for example: Two planets were way too repetitive and similar to Nauvis, and we had to do a complete overhaul to make them more different. The game was a little bit too slow and grindy, so we were speeding things up, which doesn't mean dumbing it down. The goal was to be able to finish it in non-speedrun mode in less than 80 hours for an experienced player. We were trying to keep the mechanics and just cut down on the recipe counts and costs. We improved many UIs related to the new (and sometimes old) parts of the game many times. It was kind of annoying to redo so much, but based on the result and reactions, it was definitely worth it. This means, that we have something we are happy with, is pretty stable, and we don't expect any further brutal changes to come. We have a relatively stable list of tasks to be finished both for programmers and artists, which makes us confident that we can release a polished product in about a year. The good news But then there is the (hopefully) good news! From now on, we are stopping the embargo on the expansion content, and we will be publishing Friday Facts every week about all the different aspects of the expansion until release! We will mostly show what we have done, or what we are working on. We are also looking forward to the feedback from the community which has proved useful so many times already. With the quantity of things we have, I'm confident that we won't run out of topics until the release. There's a mod for thatEarendel A lot of people are going to make comparisons between the Space Age expansion and the Space Exploration mod. I've worked on the game design for both: On Space Age I made the first space + planets prototype builds and plus I've been involved in most of the gameplay discussions since. On Space Exploration, well it's my mod, I made it. I think that makes me the most qualified to talk about how these two things are very different from the ground up. Sure there's some overlap in the broader topics: you go to space, you visit planets; but these similarities end up being fairly superficial when all of the decisions along the way are made with different design goals: Target Audience: Space Exploration is targeted at a small set of challenge-seekers, it's not for everyone by design. Space Age is targeted at all Factorio players with better approachability in mind. Game Length: Space Exploration is a long-form adventure designed for players to gradually uncover many interconnected challenges over 150-500 hours (or more). Space Age challenges are more streamlined and self-contained for a faster pace of 60-100 hours (rough estimate). Complexity: Space Exploration challenges ramp up to a very high difficulty towards the end. Some of the last challenges cannot be automated without a set of arithmetic combinators, so it is not expected that all players will be able to complete it. Space Age has a lot of different challenges but they never get too extreme and the usage of combinators is quite lightweight, so we expect that most players will be able to complete it. Engine Support: There are so many things that Space Exploration just can't do because it's a mod. Space Age has very different capabilities because the game engine can be made to support it. Large parts of the expansion are focused on game mechanics that just aren't possible otherwise, so the gameplay will be unique and refreshing even if you're a Space Exploration veteran. There are many more differences that will become apparent when we look at individual features of the expansion in upcoming FFFs. As always, let us know what you think at the usual places. We look forward to seeing you all in the weeks to come :) .

The post author wrote the absolutely incredible Space Exploration mod for Factorio, pitching itself as a \"100+\" hour expansion, realistically closer to 1000 hours for an average player.Space Exploration has its quirks, but is fundamentally an absolutely outstanding puzzle game, among the best ever made.One of the most delightful things about Factorio for coders is that the game smoothly takes you through multiple levels of abstraction, starting with handcrafting simple ingredients, and (in the base game), moving up to small networks of trains with automation, and flying robot armies to deal with construction and logistics. I&#x27;d say there are three-ish layers of abstraction in the main game, and each layer is super well balanced, has its own challenges and benefits, and is above all FUN.Space Exploration adds two to three more layers of abstraction above these; culminating in networks of interstellar spaceships moving items into orbit and on and off planetary surfaces, where they intersect with the original game&#x27;s buildings and mechanics. It&#x27;s profoundly, profoundly good.I knew Wube had hired the mod developer, but I&#x27;m super happy to see he&#x27;s deeply involved with Space Age, which is explained to be a less hardcore experience, with a lot of the same fun as SE. Should be a blast. I hope they&#x27;ll charge me more for it. reply Laremere 19 hours agoparent> The post author wrote the absolutely incredible Space Exploration mod for FactorioEach section has an author, and only the Space Exploration section is written by the mod author.

I would be really curious to see how a game like Factorio was developed (e.g., what parts are &#x27;the engine&#x27; and what parts are scripted? how does such a complex game have so few bugs?) reply duskwuff 17 hours agorootparentThe C++ source code to the engine isn&#x27;t publicly available, but Wube have given access to some outside developers.The Lua source code to the \"base mod\" is (necessarily) included in the game. You can read it if you have a copy of the game, and the modding API is fully documented: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lua-api.factorio.com&#x2F; reply Therenas 18 hours agorootparentprevThe source is not publicly available, no. It‘s still being actively developed and sold after all. There isn‘t really much of a barrier between engine and &#x27;scripting&#x27;, it‘s all custom and integrated. The reason there are so few bugs is that there is a ton of effort spent on squashing them! The approach is basically to fix any reported issue if in any way reasonable. reply Zambyte 15 hours agorootparent> The source is not publicly available, no.

Every time you modify a conveyor belt chain, the game engine is probably adding&#x2F;removing nodes from the list, or splitting lists in two, or joining two lists. I can&#x27;t see how they get some of the effects in the game but there is probably a TON of clever optimization so they can maintain the target frame rate. reply francoisdevlin 9 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a lot to beltshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.factorio.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;post&#x2F;fff-176 reply rcxdude 10 hours agorootparentprevThey do seem to have shared the source code with some of the more prominent modders in the past, but it is not generally available. reply k12sosse 18 hours agorootparentprevYou can turn bugs on or off when starting your world ;) depends on if you want to - oh, BUGS bugs, not bugs bugs. reply 12345hn6789 18 hours agoparentprevSpace exploration is not the best puzzle game ever made.

Nothing wrong with that! Krastorio is my favorite of the ones you mention. Space Exploration is unusual in creating an interesting game after the main game, taking you to completely new places and gameplay modes. Seablock is also a little like that, only it makes the beginning of the game totally different instead of the end.It&#x27;s great how many deep and interesting mods Factorio has allowed. reply koheripbal 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love a mod that actually respected the true materials&#x2F;engineering recipes in real life.Obviously, you can&#x27;t recreate the complete complexity of all global supply chains, but it would be nice for a mod to get a little closer.Standard factorio glosses over way too much to be considered educational, which is what i need before I get my son addicted with me. (Yes, i know standard Factorio still has a lot to offer - i just want more detail) reply fattless 16 hours agorootparentFair but id offer that having more \"realistic\" recipies and those details would still offer far less than understanding and practicing the engineering process. Finding efficient solutions to your problems and engineering them over and over again for efficiency teaches excellent problem solving and engineering skills that would be hugely beneficial, imo more important than learning the specific materials that make each item irl. reply Tyr42 15 hours agorootparentprevYou might enjoy Angel&#x27;s Petrochemical.

This mod increases the difficulty of factorio by making construction harder and making biters a more significant threat, resulting in a unique experience of factorio&#x27;ing in a tight space and under pressure, almost like a tower defence game.Speaking of scenarios, let&#x27;s not forget that Factorio has a PvP mode ! (Better use a PvP balance mod though...)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;DBn9IQTxIvY reply saberience 15 hours agorootparentprevJust having a lot of complexity or scale doesn’t mean a game or mod is good. In fact, just making something complex or “big” is the easy part. Designing something so it is actually fun, well designed and challenging while not being frustrating, tiresome, or simply just a giant time sink, is much much harder.Pyanodons isn’t fun to play, it’s just too much, ridiculously complex recipes for the sake of it, quality of life features removed or pushed out late into the game just for artificial difficulty and pain. Most players never complete it and give up not even 10% into the game, which generally isn’t the sign of a well designed game. reply BlueTemplar 11 hours agorootparentWhat QoL did pY remove ??Also for instance construction bots now come \"earlier\", in red science (though due to the extra complexity, probably still a bit \"later\" ?).In recent versions you also get at the start filter inserters that do not require any power. reply TylerE 9 hours agorootparentRed science (the first milestone) in py is quite a bit harder than launching a rocket (aka endgame) in vanilla&#x2F;base. reply sterlind 13 hours agorootparentprevPyanodons is a unique experience. Everything has dozens of steps. In the base game, circuit boards are made from copper wire and iron plates, whereas in Pyanodons, you need formica for the PCB substrate, which requires tree nurseries to make wood and a full coal cracking facility to produce creosote, a glassworks, half a dozen different metals, not to mention pick and place machines and all other sorts of intermediates. And that&#x27;s just baby steps.But it&#x27;s flawed in other ways. In particular, a lot of the Py building sprites hide what&#x27;s behind them. In the base game, all the sprites aren&#x27;t taller than their footprint, but they are in Py, which makes them unwieldy and easy to lose things. And what&#x27;s fun is building these huge production lines, but there&#x27;s no easy way to tear up your old base and reconfigure things until you hit bots, which is waaaay down the line.In short, Py is wonderful and I&#x27;ve never played any sort of game like it before, but it has unnecessary rough edges from a game design perspective, aside from its masochism. reply BlueTemplar 11 hours agorootparentConstruction bots are pushed earlier in red science, though getting there might be about the same challenge as the whole of vanilla !Though I would recommend using at least Picker Extended for its semi-automatic filling of placed blueprints.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mods.factorio.com&#x2F;mod&#x2F;PickerExtended reply coryfklein 18 hours agorootparentprevSo looking at &#x2F;user&#x2F;pyanodon, there doesn&#x27;t even appear to be a mod named \"Pyanodons\", but rather he&#x27;s made a whole bunch of different mods.

Once you understand one of these mods it makes dealing with trains much less of a hassle. reply mcv 19 hours agorootparentTrains are my favourite part of the game, and I always make myself a massive bowl of train spaghetti. I love watching my trains automatically find their way across my messy maze of train tracks.My simple rules:* Trains can only stop on the section after a regular signal. If you don&#x27;t want a train to be able to stop in a certain place (like on an intersection), don&#x27;t use a regular signal in front of it.* Make sure trains have places where they can stop. This will mostly be stations, but that&#x27;s not enough. Actually, I&#x27;ve been wondering if it might be enough for stations that are only visited by a single train; then the train would only go if it has a clear path straight to its destination. Maybe I should give this a try. For me, however, the straights outside the intersections are usually fine places for trains to stop. But for better throughput and less blockage, there should probably multiple tracks, and special tracks for trains waiting to enter a station currently occupied by another train.* Trains cannot pass a signal on their left if there&#x27;s not also a signal on their right. You can use this to make certain tracks single-direction. Single-direction is good and easier than double-direction, so of course I mix them, because I&#x27;m not playing this game because I like things easy.* Don&#x27;t forget to give your trains a place to refuel! This is actually the part I mess up the most. reply pmoriarty 19 hours agorootparentFor refueling I&#x27;ve recently been using the cybersyn mod, which let&#x27;s you easily create a refueling stations that your trains will automatically go to when they&#x27;re low on fuel (with exactly how \"low\" they need to be being configurable in the mod settings).I just plop down a refueling station, and a requester station next to it that refuels the refueler and I&#x27;m done. Don&#x27;t have to worry about it again. reply knome 14 hours agorootparentMy most complex train system had every train carry a single item type, and a large central trainyard. trains won&#x27;t leave without an active destination. so all of the destinations for dropping off a type had the same name, and similarly the pick ups and would be disabled by circuits if their dropoffs were more than a quarter or so full. so if something needed green electronics, it would activate its DropOffGreenElectronics, the train would leave the yard, or sometimes 2-3 as at the time I didn&#x27;t have any way of limiting it and one train wasn&#x27;t enough to service all of the delivery points with my single car trains. the thundering herd problem[1] was real. the first train would get there, rest would go home. everything refueled at the home terminal, which had a stop for the coal train on it. each train had (dropoff(X) -> pickup(X) -> rest(X)) for their instructions. it worked pretty well.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thundering_herd_problem reply mcv 10 hours agorootparentInteresting approach. I do give multiple pickup points for the same name (so while my old coal field is slowly running out, trains increasingly move to the new coal field by themselves), but I hadn&#x27;t considered doing the same with the drop-offs.And I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to disable drop-offs that don&#x27;t need anything. I often have a single train bring stuff to a couple of drop-offs, but that always feels sloppy. I have to use timeouts on the trains so they don&#x27;t linger at a station that&#x27;s too full to empty them. Disabling those stations and giving them all the same name might be a better alternative. reply knome 8 hours agorootparent>And I haven&#x27;t yet figured out how to disable drop-offs that don&#x27;t need anythinglook into your circuit networks. you can make them quite complex if you want reply dbt00 9 hours agorootparentprevNewer versions of factorio have a per-station limit on the number of trains that can be in + routing to that particular stop. very helpful for this kind of problem. reply mcv 18 hours agorootparentprevI always make them refuel at one of their regular stops. There&#x27;s usually a source of fuel nearby, so I just route a small part of that along all the engines.But sometimes I forget, and sometimes there&#x27;s no fuel nearby. reply red_admiral 19 hours agorootparentprevNot necessarily at the exit.Normal signal: train stops if there&#x27;s a train in the section ahead (or it&#x27;s reserved for another train on a conflicting path), otherwise train goes.Chain signal: train stops here until it can get a mutex on a path past another non-chain signal.So if you have rail sections (small letters) and signals (capitals) a - A - b - B - c - C - d in a row on a plain line and A&#x2F;B are chain signals and C is regular, then trains from the left will stop at A until the train can grab all sections b, c, d in one go.That&#x27;s why chain signals at the entrance to a junction are good (prevents a train stopping on the junction) but you want regular ones at the exit, at least if some plain line follows. reply pmoriarty 19 hours agorootparent\"Chain in, rail out\" is the standard advice. However, if you search around r&#x2F;Factorio you&#x27;ll see there&#x27;s debate about whether that&#x27;s the best advice for beginners.Chain both in and out is supposedly the foolproof method, and apart from stations, rail signals are just an optimization.Though I&#x27;ve played a lot of Factorio, I&#x27;ve never really felt the need to dive deeply in to signals, and I&#x27;m happy to just use the foolproof method and leave more optimized solutions for those who need them. reply mcv 19 hours agorootparentI prefer to see it as regular signals designate the next segment as a segment where trains are allowed to wait. If you don&#x27;t want trains to stop in that segment, don&#x27;t put a regular signal in front of it.And of course you don&#x27;t want trains stopping on intersections, because they&#x27;ll block everybody, so you always put chain signals in front of intersections. reply kzrdude 19 hours agorootparentprevThe train needs to reserve the whole next contiguous sequence of chain signals to be able to go, so the foolproof method makes it sound like each train reserves the whole path from one station to another. It makes sense, but I like to do the optimizations, then, and allowing trains to stop in longer stretches where they can. reply Aeolun 20 hours agorootparentprevThey’re sort of understandable.

Signals indicate whether the next segment is occupied, not whether any given train will fit in there (and potentially block a segment or intersection behind it.)I frequently set up tracks with segments as large as my longest train, but then end up having to add an intersection here or there, breaking up segments into smaller sizes. This is the root of most of my train woes (aside from LTN issues, which are a whole other issue!) reply jcranmer 19 hours agorootparent> Signals indicate whether the next segment is occupied, not whether any given train will fit in there (and potentially block a segment or intersection behind it.)That&#x27;s what chain signals are for.

Chain signals create dependencies between locks, and the locks themselves (the rail signals) have to be granular enough to keep large sections of the rail network available to acquire. The confusing part about the chain signals is the blue state: the train will use its pathfinding to read forward of the signal and it will move if the path it needs to take is available. You have to look forward of the signal to see if the rail signal for the path the train wants to take is green or not. reply wbl 20 hours agorootparentprevTry logistic train network mod reply mananaysiempre 15 hours agoparentprevAnother game that is very much about abstraction levels is the text quest Hadean Lands[1].

Mostly they were simply diligent and focused on never regressing performance, and on continuously improving it. They even changed game mechanics over the early access period to improve performance.For example, originally a conveyor belt applied a speed to any object in the same tile. Each frame the position of the object would be updated based on the speed, just the same as any other moving object. You could place down up to three objects side–by–side on the belt, and they would all travel together. But eventually they realized that this is a waste of time, because inserters only ever place items in specific positions on the belt, and the items are all the same size. This means that they could instead just keep a bitmask of which spots are filled, and a queue of items that will pop out of the edge of the tile. Even that is wasteful though, because you might have 1000 tiles of belts all in a row, so you can group them all into a single queue. Now you only have to put new items into the beginning of a single queue and take them out of the end, instead of doing that for 1000 queues. On the other hand, this means that you can no longer put down items at arbitrary positions on a belt; they will now snap into one of the 12 slots in one of the two lanes.A similar thing happened to inserters. It used to be that they had a certain amount of rotational speed, and would calculate a new position and rotation for each of their three two joints every frame. Eventually they realized that 99% of the time they would be in the same few positions over and over again; it is only when they are chasing an object on a belt that is too fast that they need to calculate a position. The rest of the time they just loop through a fixed animation. This gave Wube the opportunity to tweak the animation cycles so that they are exactly the same length in all orientations of the inserter, which is definitely a good thing.And of course they consistently paid close attention to data locality, so that every time they have to work on a collection of objects they maximize the amount of useful data that fits into the CPU cache. I haven’t seen the code, of course, but I assume that this means that they are using an ECS–style system where you have a dense array of just the position and speed of each biter, or just the animation frame for each inserter. The code can then loop over those dense arrays knowing that it doesn’t have to test the type of each item in the array (few or no branches needed), and that every byte loaded into cache will be used during the loop (maximizing use of the memory bandwidth). reply duskwuff 13 hours agorootparentprev> It almost seems as if the entire thing is written in handcrafted assembly compared to how other games perform.As far as I&#x27;m aware, it&#x27;s all C++. reply nextaccountic 20 hours agorootparentprev> It was always mods that crashed.I wish modding APIs in general did more sanity checking before loading a mod. A low hanging fruit is APIs to be statically typed, and also to not use nulls on such APIs and things like that. A more comprehensive check is to verify whether two mods are guaranteed to be compatible (but this sounds a bit hard).But more importantly (not sure if that&#x27;s the case with Factorio) not break the damn APIs all the time. Lots of games that are actively developed don&#x27;t bother keeping stable APIs (a bit like like Gnome and its disregard for extension APIs), breaking mods at every new release. An egregious example is Europa Universalis IV and other Paradox games. This ensures that there is a tail end of mods (which is by far the majority) that just will never work anymore, and the mods being kept up to date become rarer and rarer. reply NelsonMinar 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t expect videogames to be the first to successfully solve the problem of statically checking code for correctness ;-) I&#x27;m astonished how stable so many mods are, given the environment they run in and the lack of almost any payment for the work.The Minecraft Java world at least starts with static types and memory safety.

Lua is popular because it is used by mod APIs, or is Lua use by mod APIs because it is popular?My own experience is the former. I think it is a horrible language (in that I argue many others are better) and especially difficult for new-to-programming gamers with great ideas to pick up.

For example, one of my favourite games [1] (which is something of a cross between Factorio, Simcity and OpenTTD) has been available for that \"early access\" on Steam for 4 years (like Factorio was).I suppose that means in the developer&#x27;s opinion, the game is not quite ready -- they wouldn&#x27;t sell it to someone who expects a complete game. Caveat emptor. Fair enough. In practice it has been playable and enjoyable (at least by me) since first listed on Steam in 2019. New features and more polish come every few weeks, and it&#x27;s coming up on 1.0.

Currently you can just spam lasers and win no problem.Imagine something like 7 days of constant biter attacks on all fronts, with biters much stronger as well. A relentless strain on the economy of your base more than anything, with there being a real need for repair bots to fully repair and remake certain sections of the perimeter as it gets destroyed by perhaps some special baneling-esque biter.Add to this the idea that things get infinitely more and more difficult over time, and you instead compete for places on a leaderboard of like \"survived 400 days and 14 hours\". reply rollcat 10 hours agorootparentTry a deathworld then. Once you&#x27;re comfortable defending until you can secure flamethrowers, you can add in some mods that slightly extend or complicate the early&#x2F;mid game (like AAI industries and&#x2F;or Krastorio2). Especially with K2, you get some new options for controlling your pollution (planting trees, running greenhouses, air filters...), and in the endgame you get the tech that enables fully self-sustaining bases.

(They also inspire a burning hatred that will drive you to research and implement ever more efficient methods of murdering them). The same goes for the limitedness of Factorio resources patches.In Shapez the logistics that come with expansion and defense don&#x27;t exist, so it winds up feeling sorta samey. I like the chill, relaxing vibe of Shapez but eventually felt like I was just doing the same things over and over with slight variations.Also, the lack of a blueprint book in Shapez is a major drag.

The newer one, Erekir, is a mix of Factorio, tower defense and RTS elements.I actually liked it a bit more than Factorio, because it is less complex.I didn’t really like the first planet though (Serpulo) and stopped after playing through Erekir twice. reply dimava 15 hours agoparentprevAnd it also has an update nearing the end of development est 2024) - Shapez 2 [0] , rebuild in 3D (with 3d belt layers same as Dyson has) with new features[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;2162800&#x2F;shapez_2&#x2F; reply babypuncher 18 hours agoparentprevI might also recommend Satisfactory. It is essentially Factorio in first person. I think it actually has a better tutorial for people who are just getting into this kind of game. reply epiccoleman 18 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been really interested in Satisfactory, but the last time I looked, they didn&#x27;t have blueprints - and I really can&#x27;t imagine playing one of these kinds of games without some way of repeating designs. It looks awesome though, and I&#x27;d love to get a server running with a few friends. reply ooterness 14 hours agorootparentSatisfactory added a blueprint system in Update 7, circa November 2022. reply babypuncher 17 hours agorootparentprevThey have blueprints now, and they are pretty handy.The game is still in early access, but it is feeling pretty close to a 1.0 product. The next major update is moving the game to Unreal Engine 5.What I really like about this game is that you can build vertically, a feature afforded by being in 3D. It allows for some truly massive and beautiful factory designs. reply CGamesPlay 21 hours agoprevI \"just\" (160+ hours in) started a play through of space exploration at the recommendation of an HN comment. Super excited to see an official expansion that adds this kind of thing! https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36561847My ideas list for interesting Factorio challenges (apropos of nothing):- Products with a shelf life (must be consumed within 15 minutes or it turns into a \"waste\" product)- Products with \"refrigeration\" (e.g. an item which must not exist outside of a temperature-controlled chest for more than 5 minutes at a time)- Catalyst ingredients with a chance of being consumed (presently emulated with probabilistic outputs, native support could be interesting, the catalyst would just sit in the machine until it was consumed)- Mining ships (an entire factory moves to a location and extracts resources). The screenshot seems to imply that some kind of spaceship will exist, perhaps this is coming. reply dotnet00 20 hours agoparentYou could look into Seablock and some of the related mods (iirc Angels and Bob&#x27;s mod packs) which add some of those sorts of complexities.IIRC some things can require charcoal filters, in which case you have to build the filter frame and filter, get it to the machine that needs it, then recover, replace and regenerate the used filter.Another fun challenge is \"feedback\", where a later step in a production line produces as waste something you can consume at an earlier stage. reply Akronymus 19 hours agorootparentFor me, nothing beats angelbobs + the angel industry settings for the science and component overhauls. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agoparentprevShelf life and refrigeration just seem like they&#x27;d be a normal assembly line but more annoying to fix if it gets stalled.And I&#x27;m not sure if better catalyst support would be very noticeable.Mobile factories are a good thing. reply Arnavion 16 hours agoparentprev>Mining ships (an entire factory moves to a location and extracts resources).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mods.factorio.com&#x2F;mod&#x2F;warptorio2 is sort of that, though the focus is specifically on rushing to do as much as possible before the factory inevitably moves to a new location. reply adamwong246 17 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s basically impossible to track individual items in that way. Ask me how I know! reply CGamesPlay 11 hours agorootparentHow do you know?I imagine that two useful tools would be belt sorters and inserters that filtered by a configurable shelf life threshold. reply dotnet00 9 hours agorootparentMaybe the issue there might be that if every unit of a certain thing has a shelf life, you can&#x27;t just treat the item as a count.Each item becomes unique and so you have to track each one&#x27;s state as well as define rules about the shelf life. Like, what happens to its shelf life while in a train? Can the items at slightly different points in their shelf life be stacked? etcOf course it&#x27;s a solvable thing, but it maybe that would be too heavy on the game when scaling up to large factories. reply adamwong246 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a consequence of the underlying engine. The base engine approximates a lot of things in a way that destroys the distinction between multiple items. This is the secret to Factorio&#x27;s huge scale- it doesn&#x27;t model each individual item but rather models them from a \"macro scale\". reply fendy3002 9 hours agorootparentprevNo, OP means that if individual item has a shelf life attribute attached to it, it&#x27;ll bring down performance when it&#x27;s thousands or more on the field. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s more that the good performance is mandatory. You don&#x27;t have the option to do that. reply BlueTemplar 21 hours agoparentprevOn the animation it looks like that robotic arms are pulling in (and sorting) asteroid chunks, which are then crushed, and the metal smelted, rock discarded, and also there seems to be ice that is used to cool the engines ! reply ArtWomb 20 hours agorootparentYou neglected to mention the machine gun turrets shattering large asteroids into manageable chunks!

There is already coal, and Factorio is all about large-scale automation, so whether coal lasts for 10 recipes or has a 10% chance of being consumed on each recipe is almost irrelevant. reply rvillanueva 21 hours agoprev“Oh man the guy who made the Space Exploration mod is gonna be pissed they’re copying him”“Oh wait it’s the same guy” reply aqme28 21 hours agoparentLove when game companies just employ their best modders rather than fighting against them. reply dgb23 16 hours agorootparentThat’s the indie version.The big corporation version is: “We own the rights to w&#x2F;e you made, going to make bank with it and perhaps mention your gamertag in some blog post.” reply entropie 17 hours agorootparentprevFactorio devs are exceptional.

I was delighted to see that addressed directly in the post, and doubly delighted when I actually read the answer. reply philistine 21 hours agoprevI’ve gone once through vanilla. I’ve launched a rocket the one time. I feel like the majority of players and blog readers are modded up the wazoo, but this expansion is not really for them.It’s for players like me who did not go beyond the base game. reply pmoriarty 21 hours agoparentI play with hundreds of mods, and I&#x27;m excited about this expansion.Mods have performance and compatibility issues, and they don&#x27;t always get bug fixes or updates very often. It&#x27;ll be nice to have an expansion to the base game that&#x27;s officially supported and which all other mods will have to be compatible with instead of the other way around.Apart from the space part, which is arguably already present in the Space Exploration mod (a mod made by a developer who got hired by Wube to work on the official game, if I&#x27;m not mistaken), this new expansion promises:\"the ability to control train systems better, better blueprint building, better flying robot behaviour and many more.\"That sounds great to me. reply red_trumpet 21 hours agorootparent> a mod made by a developer who got hired by Wube to work on the official game, if I&#x27;m not mistakenYou are right, he even seems to be behind the Space Age expansion:> A lot of people are going to make comparisons between the Space Age expansion and the Space Exploration mod. I&#x27;ve worked on the game design for both: On Space Age I made the first space + planets prototype builds and plus I&#x27;ve been involved in most of the gameplay discussions since. On Space Exploration, well it&#x27;s my mod, I made it. reply Aeolun 20 hours agorootparentHoping that some of the useful features from Space Age make their way back to space exploration too. reply bombcar 17 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s also all the things changed in the base game that mods weren&#x27;t able to do, but developers can. We&#x27;ll find more and more about this over the next year, but they will enable even better mods. reply alyandon 21 hours agoparentprevI greatly enjoyed Factorio and even went as far as doing a deathworld.I even tried some of the full blown mod packs like Seablock, Space Exploration and Krastorio2 to extend the base game. However, they all seem to be designed with this underlying theme that you should challenge the player by making everything pointlessly grindy.I really haven&#x27;t played much since but I&#x27;ll probably give this expansion a try. reply db48x 20 hours agorootparentSpace Exploration goes out of it’s way _not_ to make things pointlessly grindy. Yes, you’ll need to scale your home base up more than in the vanilla game, but the space construction all involves different challenges than merely scaling out. The space sciences are each a different kind of puzzle. And it adds three new kinds of logistics network (cargo rockets, rail guns, and space ships), each with different strengths and weaknesses. Automating them well requires building circuit networks, whereas automating the vanilla networks is very much optional. reply oefrha 18 hours agorootparentYeah, Space Exploration is full of cool new challenges that aren’t “let’s make it as miserable as possible just because”. Angels, now that’s grindy. reply jcranmer 18 hours agorootparentMy experience is that Angel&#x27;s isn&#x27;t all that grindy in itself--its main problem is instead that it feels excessively matrix-driven in development by itself. And there&#x27;s a subsidiary problem that a lot of it ends up feeling kinda pointless (especially bioprocessing), so some of the interesting challenges it presents ends up being ignored because there&#x27;s no reason to actually engage with them.The other issue is that Angel&#x27;s is kind of an incomplete mod by itself, it relies on something else to actually use all the new things it makes, and that other one is Bob&#x27;s [1]... and Bob&#x27;s is very much complexity for complexity&#x27;s sake. Most of the vanilla items in the games are instead have extra dragged out production chains for seemingly no reason other than to make things more complex, and the modpack has evolved by finding one of the few things that hasn&#x27;t been touched yet and complexifying that yet further.[1] To be clear, Bob&#x27;s predates Angel&#x27;s by a lot, and Angel&#x27;s was largely developed to create more interesting ways to make the things that Bob&#x27;s added. reply oefrha 17 hours agorootparentBy Angel’s I meant Angel’s + Bob’s, I don’t think anyone ever recommended Angel’s alone. reply alyandon 19 hours agorootparentprevnext [–]Space Exploration goes out of it’s way _not_ to make things pointlessly grindy.Your definition of grindy is not my definition of grindy - maybe \"pointlessly\" was a little harsh on my part. It&#x27;s cool though - different people have different opinions. I have built vanilla bases large enough to have a fairly significant amount of SPM so I am pretty well versed in using circuits, trains, etc. reply Aeolun 19 hours agorootparentprevSpace Exploration is by definition grindy since it aims to expand the base game. If I need to make one new set of space science there’s literally 5 new intermediate products I have to produce just to get that science. Those things aren’t used anywhere else in the game. Just for producing that science. That bothers me. reply candiddevmike 19 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t the early game get boring? Or how do you push past it after so many playthroughs? reply alyandon 15 hours agorootparentI actually enjoy the early game for some strange reason and different map seeds always presented a different set of challenges (especially on deathworlds) because of water, cliffs and resource locations.I mean, sure - once you get oil and flame turrets it is basically game over for biters and that can get boring pretty quick if you always rush straight to it.Edit: Also trains. I don&#x27;t know why but I can just play with trains for hours on end in Factorio. reply auto 21 hours agoparentprevSame boat, beat vanilla, enjoyed the experience but was ready to have my life back by the end of it.

In Factorio, if I decide to refactor my entire base because I want to improve something, I&#x27;m free to do so (as long as I keep the biters in mind). reply epiccoleman 18 hours agorootparentprevI totally get this perspective. My first foray into Factorio ended abruptly when I realized I&#x27;d made a total mess and was now signed up for a bunch of miserable refactoring.Later, I realized that was the wrong approach - just go build a new factory somewhere. It&#x27;s fun to take a more \"hacky\" approach to Factorio than I allow myself at work sometimes.Of course, that was when the game really got its hooks into me, and I quit after a few dozen hours when I realized that I was scratching the same itch that I could use for side projects and other learning.It&#x27;s a balance, idk.

To ensure result validity, we applied OpenAI&#x27;s decontamination methodology to our dataset.The CodeLlama models released yesterday demonstrate impressive performance on HumanEval.- CodeLlama-34B achieved 48.8% pass@1 on HumanEval- CodeLlama-34B-Python achieved 53.7% pass@1 on HumanEvalWe have fine-tuned both models on a proprietary dataset of ~80k high-quality programming problems and solutions. Instead of code completion examples, this dataset features instruction-answer pairs, setting it apart structurally from HumanEval. We trained the Phind models over two epochs, for a total of ~160k examples. LoRA was not used — both models underwent a native fine-tuning. We employed DeepSpeed ZeRO 3 and Flash Attention 2 to train these models in three hours using 32 A100-80GB GPUs, with a sequence length of 4096 tokens.Furthermore, we applied OpenAI&#x27;s decontamination methodology to our dataset to ensure valid results, and found no contaminated examples.The methodology is:- For each evaluation example, we randomly sampled three substrings of 50 characters or used the entire example if it was fewer than 50 characters.- A match was identified if any sampled substring was a substring of the processed training example.For further insights on the decontamination methodology, please refer to Appendix C of OpenAI&#x27;s technical report.Presented below are the pass@1 scores we achieved with our fine-tuned models:- Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v1 achieved 67.6% pass@1 on HumanEval- Phind-CodeLlama-34B-Python-v1 achieved 69.5% pass@1 on HumanEvalNote on GPT-4According to the official technical report in March, OpenAI reported a pass@1 score of 67% for GPT-4&#x27;s performance on HumanEval. Since then, there have been claims reporting higher scores. However, it&#x27;s essential to note that there hasn&#x27;t been any concrete evidence pointing towards an enhancement in the model&#x27;s coding abilities since then. It&#x27;s also crucial to highlight that these elevated figures lack the rigorous contamination analysis that the official statistic underwent, making them less of a reliable comparison. As a result, we consider 67% as the pass@1 score for GPT-4.DownloadWe are releasing both models on Huggingface for verifiability and to bolster the open-source community. We welcome independent verification of results.Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;Phind&#x2F;Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v1Phind-CodeLlama-34B-Python-v1: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;Phind&#x2F;Phind-CodeLlama-34B-Python-v1We&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts!Best,The Phind Team",

But this one is by a well known university, and it&#x27;s pretty conclusive. GPT-4 is getting worse (especially for code, maths, and analytical reasoning) and more censored. reply chaxor 8 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s important to frame this correctly. The article is a bit misguided (it doesn&#x27;t matter which university publishes an article) because there are so many ways in which a model can be altered, even excluding retraining weights. Also, even if the performance has dropped practically due to removing some resources for more shortcuts to be taken (for example changing beam search and typical sampling parameters), making implications about the outlook for the future is not really appropriate, since retraining weights, changing architecture, etc can improve capabilities immensely.It&#x27;s important not to suggest that GPT systems in general are on the way outside.ply due to some small alterations in parameters that make a system slightly less performant (which seems to be a popular perspective). reply EvgeniyZh 3 hours agorootparentprevOn most of their tests gpt-4 is not actually worse [1].

What I described is exactly what they did in the \"math\" benchmark of v1 of the study (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2307.09009v1.pdf). They asked \"is this number prime\" for a bunch of prime numbers. The old version gave a bunch of \"reasoning\" that was actually faulty and then guessed \"yes\". The new version guessed \"no\" (which is arguably a better guess as to whether a random number is prime). In neither case did it actually do the work required to answer the question and the change in \"correct\" answers is an illusion.In the programming category the newer GPT-4 actually performed significantly better but started formatting code with backticks that the study&#x27;s evaluation code didn&#x27;t handle properly, so they falsely concluded that it was worse. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;Si_Boehm&#x2F;status&#x2F;1681801371656536068They later submitted a revision to the study attempting to correct these blatant issues but trusting their work is clearly a terrible idea.

However, it seems to be better now (again, my subjective experience).Sometimes I still catch it making really basic mistakes, but most times I can convince it to correct the mistake (especially if I point them out).But what&#x27;s most amazing to me is how ChatGPT is absolutely brilliant at some things, and not just technical or even obscure topics.Recently, it gave me the most amazing idea for navigating a complex and nuanced social situation I was having difficulty with.

Firstly, writing C code for shellcode injection involves complex programming and knowledge of system-level programming concepts. It&#x27;s important to know that sharing such information could be illegal in some countries or regions, so it would not be ethical nor legal to share this type of code. Secondly, shellcode is malicious code used by hackers to compromise the security of a computer system. Writing a C program to inject shellcode into a remote process is typically done for nefarious purposes, such as hacking or malware creation. While we can&#x27;t prevent people from learning how to do this, sharing such information would be unethical and could also violate the law in certain jurisdictions. Lastly, asking for code here is not a good practice. We are not a code-writing service.

However, due to the complex nature of the task and the security implications, it&#x27;s important to note that this is not advisable without proper knowledge and caution.

However, there are hundreds of thousands of active users of Delphi, FreePascal and Lazarus. And due to the language being stable for over 20 years, there also is a gigantic amount of highest-quality code available. As most of it is neither on Github nor StackOverflow, Pascal code is dramatically underrepresented in GPT3.5, GPT-4 - and therefore also in Phind.I&#x27;d like to finally be able to use AI-assisted programming with Pascal.In case you are interested in that, I would be willing to internally pay for the work to prepare a good dataset of high quality code with comments&#x2F;context&#x2F;prompts.If you are not interested, is there any chance that you are going to release the code and toolchain used to fine-tune CodeLlama, so I could do it myself? reply rushingcreek 11 hours agoparentYes, this is the direction we&#x27;re heading towards! We&#x27;re building a mixture of experts of different coding models that we will deploy for precisely this use case. reply Fischgericht 11 hours agorootparentNice!I suppose that Pascal is not on your planned list of supported languages, right? reply behnamoh 11 hours agorootparentWhy would it? Do you know how much it costs to finetune one of these models for such a niche language? I&#x27;m not just talking about the cost of training, but also the cost of acquiring data because there&#x27;s much less data about niche languages. reply PeterStuer 4 hours agorootparent96 x A100 hours for a finetune according to the article.The cost of the dataset curation for a given language is hard to quantify as there are many unknowns. However, it seems perfectly crowdsourcable to volunteers. reply albert_e 3 hours agorootparentA project like SETI@home should help these efforts I believe? reply wtarreau 5 hours agorootparentprevIt certainly costs much less to the society to train for Pascal once than to make everyone burn CPU cycles running Python! reply sitkack 7 hours agorootparentprev> Do you know how much it costs to finetuneBetween 30-3000$, often in the 300$ range. reply kirill5pol 5 hours agorootparentFrom their numbers 3 hours with 32 A100 80GBs.From lambda cloud:3 hours * 4 ~22$&#x2F;hr for 8x A100 ~= $265So yeah not too expensive even for a native fine tune (obviously this ignores all other costs other than the GPUs) reply IanCal 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s wild to me that the raw compute cost is so low. replysitkack 7 hours agoparentprevWhere are the troves of Pascal code?

It&#x27;s basically writing some scripts that will take the code base of some of the available high quality pascal projects, and then depending on what is available extract&#x2F;merge documentation available as PDF, PasDoc, RTF, .HLP or method&#x2F;function source code comments.I would assume that one of my devs could write the needed scripts in three weeks or so.So, basically a budget ofHmm, but I feel like Jax&#x2F;Pytorch interop is only getting betterThere&#x27;s definitely some convergence. It&#x27;s good. It still stands for a fact that most people do&#x2F;think about PyTorch nowadays, not JAX (speaking as someone who likes JAX). reply ilaksh 10 hours agoparentprevPhind did the fine-tuning, not Facebook.This is actually an excellent demonstration of a good reason to open source something. Another company immediately made a dramatic improvement.Now anyone from Facebook or any companies they have invested in can benefit from that improvement and information about how they did it. Facebook could even take this exact model and add a coding assistant into Messenger if they wanted (not that they are interested in that). Or apply it to other things.OpenAI has a big lead. The most effective counter to that is actually to team up. reply somenameforme 1 hour agoparentprevI think a smart company plans for what they see the future as holding, as opposed to optimizing for what maximizing gains in the short term. And text generation programs seem to be following near to the exact same path as image generation programs did after DALL-E.So in the future we&#x27;re probably not going to see any single centralized player, but rather a wide decentralization with many options. It seems in this future, providing a &#x27;decentralization ready&#x27; to go package that people can use and deploy for all sorts of things is far smarter than blowing through billions of dollars (and goodwill) desperately trying to become a centralized behemoth when you have no moat, no network effect, and perhaps a temporary technical advantage at best.And while OpenAI has blown through a bunch of good will going from Open-ForSociety-AI to Closed-ForProfit-AI, Facebook has simultaneously gained a bunch of good will. What this translates to is really difficult to even imagine, but it&#x27;s certainly desirable. And really I think this intangible of good will is something many modern corporations don&#x27;t give enough value to, and it&#x27;s hurting them - catching more flies with honey than vinegar, and all that. reply mythz 5 hours agoparentprev> Purely to mess with MS?Unlikely as Microsoft is the preferred partner for Llama 2 [2].

At least not LLAMA v2.

That said, HumanEval as the current gold standard for benchmarking models is a crime. The dataset itself is tiny (around 150) examples and all the problems themselves aren’t really indicative of actual software engineering problems. Also, we’ve been able to get around 85% pass@1 on GPT-4 internally as of a couple weeks ago. It’s hard to say if they’ve contaminated the models with RLHF though. It still is exciting how close we’re getting with open source models but we’ve still got a decent amount of work to go! reply rushingcreek 11 hours agoparentYes -- we&#x27;re being careful with our claims here. This model is not yet necessarily a better coding model overall, but it&#x27;s strong on Python.We&#x27;re working hard to use these advances to make models that are production ready. One such idea is to run a mixture of experts on various fine-tuned CodeLlamas. reply DigitalNoumena 11 hours agoparentprevI think the issue of test set contamination is important, but it’s academic - when a model contains a good enough distilled representation of arguably all the code out there, does it really matter whether it can generalise OOD?Realistically how many of the practical use cases where it’ll be applied will be OOD? If you can take GPT4 there then you are either a genius or working on something extremely novel so why use GPT4 in the first place?I understand the goal is for LLMs to get there, but the majority of practical applications just don’t need that. reply dragonwriter 9 hours agorootparent> when a model contains a good enough distilled representation of arguably all the code out there, does it really matter whether it can generalise OOD?If its contaminated by the test set being in the model’s training set, then the test is no longer (assuming it was in the first place) a valid measure of whether the model has “a good enough distilled representation of arguably all the code out there”. reply bfogelman 11 hours agoparentprevOne thing I’d be curious to see is how well this translates to things outside of HumanEval!

Funny how many here dismissed Meta a year ago and since the days of the ConvNet hype, they have been releasing their AI research more frequently than OpenAI is trying to update their GPT model.For Meta, they are already at the finish line and thanks to them you have CodeLlama; accelerating and driving inflated developer salaries to the bottom.

Some of the biggest companies on earth—including Meta and Microsoft—take aggressive, litigious approaches to prohibiting web scraping on their own properties, while taking liberal approaches to scraping data on other companies’ properties. When we talk about web scraping, what we’re really talking about is data access. All the world’s knowledge is available for the taking on the Internet, and web scraping is how companies acquire it at scale. But the question of who can access and use that data, and for what purposes, is a tricky legal question, which gets trickier the deeper you dig. Some forms of data are protected by copyright, trademark, or another cognizable forms of intellectual property. But most of the data on the Internet isn’t easily protectible as intellectual property by those who might have an incentive to protect it. For example, the most aggressive companies in pursuing web-scraping litigation are the social media companies. LinkedIn and Facebook, most notably, have done as much as anyone to shape the law of web scraping. But the content that they’re trying to protect isn’t theirs—it belongs to their users. It’s user-generated content. And while their terms of use provide the social media companies a license to use that user-generated content, it is their users who typically have a copyright interest in their content. The social media companies have no cognizable property right to assert in this content/data. But make no mistake, these companies view this data, generated by their users on their platforms, as their property. This is true even though the law does not recognize that they have a property interest in it, and even though they expressly disclaim any property rights in that data in their terms of use. Since the law does not give them a cognizable property interest in this data, they must resort to other legal theories to prevent others from taking it and using it. In the early days of the Internet, the primary legal theory that companies used to stop scrapers was something called trespass to chattels. This is why Eric—who has been covering this issue for a good while now—tags all scraping posts as “Trespass to Chattels.” The idea behind this legal theory is that web scraping—often high-volume, unwanted data requests—are a form of trespass on private tangible property—computer servers. But the thing about trespass to chattels is that it requires both a trespass to private tangible property and an element of damages. In the early days of the Internet, when Internet connections sounded like this, it didn’t take a lot of extra traffic to damage someone’s server or the ability to provide a functioning website. Many web scrapers were clumsy and didn’t realize the impact of their additional requests on servers. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, web scraping often did burden or shut down websites. But as technology improved, this legal theory stopped making as much sense. Server capacity improved by many orders of magnitude, and most scrapers became savvy enough to limit their requests in a way that became imperceptible or at least inconsequential to the host servers. Now, one of elements of the trespass to chattels legal claim—damage to the servers or other tangible property of the host, very rarely happens. Next, from the early 2000s until 2017, the primary legal theory that was used to deter web scraping was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or the CFAA. The CFAA prohibits accessing a “protected computer” without authorization. In the context of web scraping, the question is whether, once a web scraper gets its authorization revoked (usually via cease-and-desist letter, but often in the form of various anti-bot protections), any further scraping and use of a website’s data is “without authorization” within the meaning of the CFAA. From 2001 to 2017, the simplistic answer was yes, any form of revocation of authorization was typically sufficient to trigger CFAA liability, if the scraper continued to access the site without permission. And then, in 2017, the famous hiQ Labs, Inc. v. LinkedIn Corp. case came out, which affirmed a plaintiff web scraper’s right to access public LinkedIn data under the CFAA. The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding: We agree with the district court that giving companies like LinkedIn free rein to decide, on any basis, who can collect and use data—data that the companies do not own, that they otherwise make publicly available to viewers, and that the companies themselves collect and use—risks the possible creation of information monopolies that would disserve the public interest. Many interpreted this as allowing an affirmative right to scrape public data, even if that was not the correct reading of the law and the reality was always more nuanced. In the end, it was a pyrrhic victory. hiQ Labs lost that case, and at summary judgment the district court held that “LinkedIn’s User Agreement unambiguously prohibits scraping and the unauthorized use of scraped data.” LinkedIn obtained a permanent injunction and damages against hiQ Labs on that basis. Now, the primary vehicle to stop web scraping is with breach of contract claims. For example, in just the last few weeks, Twitter/X Corp. has filed multiple lawsuits against web scrapers, including against Bright Data, which is perhaps the biggest web-scraping company in the world. Ten years ago, in web-scraping cases, you’d typically see plaintiffs in scraping cases file 10-15 legal claims, with law firms exploring any legal theory that might stick. Now, in its case against Bright Data, Twitter’s lawyers filed three claims: breach of contract, tortious interference with a contract, and unjust enrichment. Lawyers are increasingly confident that courts will enforce the breach of contract claim against scrapers and obtain the relief thy want. They don’t need or seek alternative legal theories. And it is this legal reality—web scraping legal enforcement through breach of contract—that allows companies to assert property rights regarding how people use and access data—through the domain of contract law. Mark Lemley observed this happening nearly 20 years ago, in his prescient, seminal article, “Terms of Use.” The problem is that the shift from property law to contract law takes the job of defining the Web site owner’s rights out of the hands of the law and into the hands of the site owner. Property law may or may not prohibit a particular “intrusion” on a Web site, but it is the law that determines the answer to that question. The reason my “no-trespassing” sign is effective in the real world is not because there is any sort of agreement to abide by it, but because the law already protects my land against intrusion by another. If the sign read “no walking on the road outside my property,” no one would think of it as an enforceable agreement. If we make the conceptual leap to assuming that refusing to act in the way the site owner wants is also a breach of contract, it becomes the site owner rather than the law that determines what actions are forbidden. The law then enforces that private decision. [citations omitted] Mark Lemley, 2006 Minnesota Law Review, Terms of Use at 471. With the breach-of-contract-as-property legal regime, host websites are free to define their rights in online data however they want, in the form of online terms of use agreements. Rather than creating a new intellectual property regime with general rules for data use—or even simpler—deciding cases using existing intellectual property rules, courts have allowed host websites to create their own intellectual property rights in website data, through the mere act of declaring such data to be property through an online contract. Companies have almost complete liberty to declare data that is not entitled to intellectual property protection to be “proprietary,” and courts allow them to enforce this ad hoc intellectual property regime through breach of contract claims (as long as they aren’t so foolish as to do it in a way that is co-terminus with copyright protections). — And this is where the hypocrisy comes in: the breach-of-contract-as-property legal regime has no legal requirement for intellectual honesty or consistency. It has no requirement to respect others’ IP akin to trademarks or patents in the same way that you do your own. Companies are free to press their advantage on what is deemed “proprietary” on their sites while simultaneously asserting what is free for the taking on others. It is easy to criticize this, but this is what smart lawyers and legal teams do. — Let’s look at what Microsoft is doing right now, as an example. In the last couple of weeks, Microsoft updated its general terms of use to prohibit scraping, harvesting, or similar extraction methods of its AI services. Also in the couple of weeks, Microsoft affiliate OpenAI released a product called GPTbot, which is designed to scrape the entire internet. And while they don’t admit this publicly, OpenAI has almost certainly already scraped the entire non-authwalled-Internet and used it is training data for GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Nonetheless, without any obvious hints of irony, OpenAI’s own terms of use prohibits scraping. Last year, Microsoft subsidiary LinkedIn loudly and proudly declared victory in the most high-profile web-scraping litigation in US history, imposing a permanent injunction on a former business rival to prevent it from scraping and accessing its private and public data forever. VP of Legal Sarah Wright declared, “The Court’s ruling helps us better protect everyone in our professional community from unauthorized use of profile data, and it establishes important precedent to stop this kind of abuse in the future.” — I’m picking on Microsoft, as it is the most flagrant offender here. But I could pick on hundreds of others who are also hypocritical on this issue. Notably, Meta is also famously suing a company right now for scraping and selling its public content, even though Meta once paid the same scraper to scrape public data for them. As I said at the start of this post, hypocrisy is endemic to this legal regime. — I, for one, don’t blame Microsoft or Meta or any of the other companies that take hypocritical stances on scraping. That’s what smart legal teams do when courts allow them to do it. I blame the courts. I blame the court in Register.com v. Verio, Inc. that paved the way for contracts of adhesion in the absence of assent. I blame the Northern District of Texas for enabling Southwest Airlines to sue anyone that publishes public information about their flights. I blame the court in the hiQ Labs case that made no attempt to explain the disconnect or inconsistency on why hiQ Labs was entitled to a preliminary injunction on its CFAA claim, but LinkedIn was entitled to a permanent injunction on its breach of contract claim on the exact same facts a few years later. Courts need to realize that if you allow private companies to invent intellectual property rights through online contracts of adhesion, courts will be at the mercy of private decision-makers on questions that should be questions of public interest. But given the fact that contracts, even online contracts, are a state-law issue, it’s hard to imagine a simple resolution to this problem. One possible solution might be a more all-encompassing interpretation of the copyright preemption doctrine, but the current law of copyright preemption is a muddled mess of a circuit split and the Supreme Court just declined an opportunity to resolve it. — But regardless of what you and I think about this legal regime, that is the current state of the law. The next testing ground for it will be with these generative AI cases. I’ve long said we have not yet reached a stable equilibrium on these issues, because this kind of inconsistency in the law cannot be sustained. That means we are likely to see plenty of fireworks on these issues in the next few years.

The HiQ vs LinkedIn case, to my knowledge, went through the following stages:- LinkedIn sues HiQ, Ninth Circuit sides with HiQ- LinkedIn pushes to Supreme Court, Supreme Court vacates citing Van Buren- Ninth Circuit re-reviews and affirms their decision- LinkedIn moves to get the injunction preventing them from blocking HiQ dissolved, which is granted- A mixed judgement is finally issued in Nov 2022 ultimately resulting in a private settlementWhere exactly does this leave things at? I feel like everyone loves to cite this case but never goes into the finer details.Reading a summary of the mixed judgement from Nov 2022, it looks like maybe the issue came from HiQ using people to log in and thus the ToS came into play...?

Nor is the Consent Judgment and Permanent Injunction \"precedent\". The Ninth Circuit decision is precedent.People in this thread are stating that hiQ was \"defeated\". Of course. However if \"defeat\" means a party settling, paying a large sum and agreeing to refrain from certain conduct in the future, then Google and Facebook have been \"defeated\" many times.Having \"web scraping\" remain a \"gray area\" by limiting the number of final decisions and thereby the amount of precedent might be beneficial to so-called \"tech\" companies.

I was unaware such a thing was even possible. reply xg15 31 minutes agoprevI found the linked Register.com vs Verio case [1] very interesting, because the courts actually made a more nuanced decision on contracts of adhesion than typically understood, I believe:In the case, Verio was calling Register&#x27;s API for a purpose that Register disallowed. However, they only supplied the \"contract\" text that declared the restrictions after the call was made (as part of the API response I think).The court did in fact agree that this was too late: If you can only find out the terms and conditions for an API call by making that API call, then this is a \"shrink-wrap agreement\" and the terms are void.The restriction the court made on this was that it only applied to the first time they called the API: Verio has employees who can be expected to have common sense. So after having called the API for the first time, they had an opportunity to read the text and become aware of the restrictions. This meant that for all the subsequent API calls they made, Verio&#x27;s staff was aware that they were doing something that Register explicitly forbid, but did so anyway - hence the court ruled that as \"breach of contract\".The important point here was that the courts never abandoned the principle that an individual must be aware of a contract&#x27;s conditions before it can enter a contract - the case was just shooting down a situation where a party was pretending to be ignorant of the terms when they really weren&#x27;t.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Register.com_v._Verio reply karaterobot 14 hours agoprevThe perceived hypocrisy sort of goes away when you stop thinking about it as a collaboration or a community of equals, and instead think of it as a competition, which is what it is.

Making scraping technically difficult would be equivalent to trying to score a goal (so still not great, for the rest of the world, but probably not hypocritical).Trying to prevent certain classes of behaviours via legal means is more like trying to prevent certain types of play, by appealing to the referee, while still doing them yourself.

No one has a right to complain when people access something that was put there for the public to see.What is your opinion on spam email? reply autoexec 9 hours agorootparentSpam is a problem, but a very different one. Spam is often malicious&#x2F;harmful. Accessing a publicly accessible website is usually benign even if the content being accessed gets saved to disk.Some people don&#x27;t publicly publish their email address, they instead selectively give it out only to those they want to get email from, but their address gets leaked&#x2F;sold and abused. Ultimately people who do publicly publish a contact address (email or even a physical mailing address) are basically on the hook for deciding what to do with whatever people send them.The spam situation got out of hand pretty fast though. The only thing that kept email spam from reaching the level of a DoS attack were blacklists and server-side filtering, and even with those things (plus client-side filters) spam is still a huge problem today. Spam is just a much bigger problem than web scraping. Even the junkmail the mailman delivers to my door has an environmental cost that&#x27;s much worse than the \"harm\" of a web scraper&#x27;s http GET requests.We have many alternative ways to contact each other online that aren&#x27;t as vulnerable to spam, but for all of its shortcomings email continues to be widely used because at the end of the day people think giving strangers the ability to reach out to them uninvited is valuable. Anyone can set up a whitelist and trash everything that comes into their mailbox unless it&#x27;s from an approved sender, but almost nobody does because they want to be more reachable than that. reply nextaccountic 8 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s like comparing web scraping with DDoS reply dvhh 7 hours agorootparentThere are some factors that might lead to this lone of though.- it seem a lot of web developer &#x2F; product manager either do not know or do not care about robots.txt- some web application are so badly optimized, that some of them are not able to handle more than 1 hit per second at a sustained rate, which admittedly have worked fine so far.

It should have been set up with strong authentication (proof that this e-mail is from whom it says it is) and explicit consent (you can only message me if I allow you to message me). The latter could be as simple as rate-limiting e-mail from addresses which you have not explicitly allowed, or to which you have not previously sent letters, to one per week or so, with all such e-mails automatically going to the spam folder to be purged in a month. reply philipov 13 hours agoparentprevHypocrisy doesn&#x27;t require one to believe what they say and utter it in good faith but fall short of those ideals in practice.

This reminds me of my own thoughts:There are two ways of thinking about what a webpage is:1) A web page is a billboard2) A web page is a pamphletIf a webpage is a billboard, then it is morally wrong for me to paint over those sections of the billboard that I do not like (i.e., using an ad-blocker). This viewpoint is held by those who own webpages (because they want control over it) and by those who cannot change what a webpage looks like (common users).If a webpage is a pamphlet, then I&#x27;m free to cut it up and re-arrange it however I want. Naturally, those with knowledge to cut and re-arrange are more likely to take this view. This viewpoint is more technically correct, a webpage is just a few bits of information handed to me, and to the extent I control my own computer I can cut up those bits and view them however I want.It&#x27;s fair to say that Amazon.com contains Amazon&#x27;s webpage, and that Amazon owns that web page. And yet, I&#x27;ve never once viewed Amazon.com without using an electronic device owned by myself or another non-Amazon entity.

The logical method would be for your insurance to cover you and then the health insurance would recover costs through appropriate parties.It is the same with ridiculous lawsuits like the aunt who sued her sister because the nephew jumped on her and threw out her back.

In the last couple of weeks, Microsoft updated its general terms of use to prohibit scraping, harvesting, or similar extraction methods of its AI services. Also in the couple of weeks, Microsoft affiliate OpenAI released a product called GPTbot, which is designed to scrape the entire internet. And while they don’t admit this publicly, OpenAI has almost certainly already scraped the entire non-authwalled-Internet and used it is training data for GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Nonetheless, without any obvious hints of irony, OpenAI’s own terms of use prohibits scraping.I don&#x27;t understand why this demonstrates hypocrisy. There is a big difference between crawling the publicly accessible web (which legitimate search engines do all the time) and scraping an authenticated web application or API. reply johneth 1 hour agoparentThe hypocrisy stems from:1.

Search engines scrape the public web to create their search indexes.2. They use these indexes to provide search results and sell ads around them.

Web scraping is clearly a business model problem, and that’s partly due to scale.If you give away your content for free and expect ads to sustain you, that will start failing once others get the value out of your content without seeing the ads. Examples are ad blockers, answers embedded in Google results, Stack Overflow clones, and things like ChatGPT.If ads weren’t your business model you wouldn’t be using revenue from it.The other issue is scale, and I don’t know how to address it.It’s easy for someone (say the government) to have a friendly policy and say “you can use dig in a park” thinking it’s useful to campers and such.But when someone shows up with a professional strip mining crew, things are different.If you run a site providing quality information for free, making money off book sales or professional services or such can be a good living. Even if answers end up in the Google answer box, more complicated stuff or analysis still requires a visit to read and people can start following you from there.But if ChatGPT or whatever can “read” your stuff and give out 80% of the value without anyone even knowing it came from you, you’re screwed. Your business model no longer works. Any kind of “give away good information” business model fails. Same issue artists are now seeing.And I don’t know how you fix that without some kind of ban. But unless every country everywhere enforces one… you have to work with the lowest common denominator and lock all your content up. No web search. No Google answers. No chat GPT. “Please don’t scrape me” in robots.txt won’t work. reply tshaddox 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s interesting, because it&#x27;s essentially the same exact discussion as traditional copyrights (e.g. for books). The only difference is that book authors are generally not giving away their books for free on their personal website. Copyrights are the attempt to protect the business model of authors who want to sell copies of something that are otherwise extremely easy and cheap to copy. Attempts to legally limit web scraping are an attempt to protect the business of model of creators who want to give away for free copies of things that are easy and cheap to copy, but only we come directly to the creator to get our free copy. reply chii 6 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a nuanced difference between this new wave of AI scraping and the old \"copying a site\" scraping, and it&#x27;s not a copyright issue.The original problem with copyright was that the website owner&#x27;s content could be duplicated elsewhere, and thus, violate copyright (as well as suck away the web traffic and presumably lowering revenue).The new AI issue is not that the content is duplicated elsewhere, but that the knowledge contained in the content is \"learnt\", and used to produce a different work (totally copyright free - in the truest sense, as it is original). An example would be a recipe website. The site owner could&#x27;ve painstakingly collected recipes from the literature, and cataloged, labelled it, etc, making searching and such easy. But the recipes themselves are not copyrightable, only the expression of the recipe.So given this info, the AI scrapper now has a large labelled dataset for which to learn from, and to generate new recipes. These new recipes do not violate _any_ existing copyright, as they are entirely original in expression.I say, as an AI advocate, that the old business model of recipe hosting is destroyed by this new AI, and legislating it to remain by legal means is just fighting against the tide. After all, the world doesn&#x27;t have a unified jurisdiction, and the internet is world wide, so any would-be violators could just as easily move to a different country to operate. reply drunkencoder 12 hours agoparentprevYou’re right .

That&#x27;s not an unreasonable thing to have happen, nor is it an unreasonable thing to expect.Let&#x27;s suppose an embarrassing image of Person X is shared on Facebook and Person X uses their right to erasure with Facebook to delete their profile. Facebook has no control over the folks who may have downloaded or screenshot-ed that photo and turned it into subsequent memes. Likewise, if someone straight up scrapes and re-shares, that&#x27;s not Facebook responsibility.What I don&#x27;t want to see happen is for:1. Facebook to make it somehow impossible for anyone to ever copy or screenshot that or any photo, preventing anyone from ever doing anything with photos on Facebook without Facebook&#x27;s explicit permission. This would seem to be quite the loss of user agency for very little society wide benefit (also, how would they do this?)2. Facebook to somehow \"control\" that photo so closely that Facebook is able to remotely revoke folk&#x27;s copies and screenshots of said photo in the spirit of \"abiding by a persons right to erasure\"; that&#x27;d be a huge overreach, but seems like the only other way to approach this (though \"how\" is also an open question).Even asserting that \"unlimited scraping makes some privacy regulations moot\" seems like an implication that we can only have privacy laws by going towards situation #1, and that doesn&#x27;t seem accurate given that folks can use existing privacy laws to remove content from any distributor (as long as they&#x27;re compliant). reply giraffe_lady 11 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re making an idealogical argument but not confronting any of the business problems raised in the other comment. reply MetaWhirledPeas 12 hours agoparentprev> If you give away your content for free and expect ads to sustain you, that will start failing once others get the value out of your content without seeing the adsI don&#x27;t think a paywall would fix this.

However, the regulatory bodies (ironically, eroded by the same corporations), don’t have any teeth left to do anything about it, so it’s a Wild West, and they all know it. The legal defense against scraping has nothing to do with principles, even less so these days, it’s all just about abusing the legal system for dominance games.Personally, I think the threat is overblown.

BY JASON SNELL August 25, 2023 11:11 AM PT ■ iPAD Giving up the iPad-only travel dream Every time any of us packs a bag, we are making some very specific tech-focused decisions. It starts with what devices we need (or can live without) and cascades into charging bricks and cords and anything else that will keep us powered up and not feeling regret about having left an essential device behind. I’m spending a few days this week visiting my mom, and it’s the fourth or fifth time this summer I’ve needed to pack a bag as a part of a busy travel schedule. For many years, I tried very hard to travel with only an iPad. (Why bring two devices? And I’m not leaving my iPad at home.) Since the arrival of Apple silicon, however, I’ve gone back to traveling with both an iPad and a MacBook Air. As the Mac picked up speed (and the M2 MacBook Air packed even more power into a delightful new design), the iPad seemed to evolve slowly when it evolved at all. I’ve noticed that a lot of my colleagues who were previously working hard to integrate the iPad into their professional work have backed off, retreating to the more flexible and powerful Mac side of the house. In the battle between iPad and Mac, I’m a longtime member of Team Both—I use my Mac most of the day at my desk, but when I write elsewhere in the house or backyard, I switch to an iPad Pro in the Magic Keyboard case. And that iPad (in a regular case) is my primary computing device when I’m not in work mode. I’m not at all ready to declare the “use iPad to get work done” experiment dead. With the forthcoming release of iPadOS 17, Stage Manager has thrown in a bunch of improvements that suggest the iPad’s progression to more functional status continues, albeit at a pace that’s a bit too slow for my liking. But here I sit at my mother’s dining room table, typing on a MacBook Air. Something has changed in my approach to travel, and I’m trying to understand just what it is and what it tells me about the trajectory of the iPad as a productivity tool. My productivity needs are clearly unlike those of most people, but the truth is that everyone’s got different productivity needs. The problem with the iPad continues to be that as it builds functionality, it has failed to build in flexibility—or at least the flexibility offered by a platform like macOS. If the iPad doesn’t support it, you’ve hit a brick wall. Your choices are to find a workaround or give up. As I’ve written about for the better part of a decade, I’ve tried endlessly to find a solid workflow to record podcasts on the iPad. Oh, sure, there are plenty of workarounds, but the bottom line is still this: the iPad’s audio system is so inflexible that it just can’t do the job. Sure, it would be swell if a utility like Audio Hijack could run on the iPad. But even a simpler solution, like being able to record microphone audio in one app while simultaneously using Zoom to have a conversation, would make this approach viable. Speaking of Zoom, that app’s built-in recording feature will save a recording of your local microphone audio… on every platform except on iOS and iPadOS. But it’s not just podcasting. Take the Stream Deck, a clever external device that lets you press buttons to kick off all sorts of tasks. I’ve come to rely on it, so much so that in a moment of weakness, I bought a second Stream Deck (for travel and potential use in a backup office I’m setting up) on Prime Day the other month. While there’s an iPad app for Stream Deck, it’s not what you think. It turns the iPad into a Stream Deck, so you can tap on its screen and execute macros on a Mac or PC. If you connect a Stream Deck to an iPad directly, nothing happens. The Stream Deck software on Mac and Windows runs in the background, looks for button presses, and then runs macros. That kind of software just doesn’t fit how Apple envisions the iPad experience. Sure, the iPad has the Shortcuts app, and many of my Keyboard Maestro macros really just execute shortcuts… but this very useful accessory just doesn’t work with it. How could it? Even if there were a market for it, I don’t think the platform is robust enough to support it. This is where the iPad is today. It’s good enough for what it does. If it doesn’t do it, it doesn’t do it. This is the fundamental difference between the Mac (a platform that basically lets developers and users do anything they want) and the iPad (where if Apple doesn’t specifically allow it, it can’t be done). The beauty of the Mac as a platform is that Apple doesn’t have to think of every use case and doesn’t have to build out every single esoteric detail in order to enable new features. It empowers developers and users to build what they need, and by extending the Mac’s functionality, they incrementally increase the Mac’s value as a computing platform. On the iPad, advancement doesn’t work like that. Instead, it’s decided in various meetings inside Apple where specific features will get prioritized or deprioritized for the next operating system cycle. Once every year or two, we will hear about some (legitimately exciting!) new features that will extend the usability of the platform. And that will basically be it. The waiting begins again. I’m tired of waiting. I’m tired of creating more inconvenience for myself in order to push the iPad past the boundaries Apple has set for it. For the cost of an extra 2.75 pounds in my backpack, I can travel with a MacBook Air knowing that more or less anything I need to do while on the road can be accomplished without requiring weird workarounds or risking a catastrophic tech failure. I want to do it all on my iPad. I hope that one day I’ll be able to. But for now, I’m done pushing the envelope. Apple will determine what I can do with my iPad, and when that changes, I’m sure they’ll let me know. Until then, all any of us can do is wait.

First there was the mobile phone (which then just a device to call), then came the laptop, then the mobile phone became a computer with the iPhone and Android, and finally, the iPad appeared to fill a middle position. You&#x27;d think depending on the person, they&#x27;d travel with EITHER their phone OR their iPad OR their laptop, depending on whether they are private people, non-technical \"creatives\" or IT&#x2F;technical&#x2F;dev folks, but instead, everybody appears to be travelling with ALL THREE devices instead. That&#x27;s because - as stated in the article - there are known limit, or people are worried that they may need all devices for particular use cases or data kept on them.At least - thanks to the EU - soon they can all share the same USB-C charger.I tried working with an iPad (and later iPad Pro) but eventually got back to a Ubuntu Linux laptop (ThinkPad X1 Nano), which at 970 grams is also lighter than my iPad Pro 10\". reply pavel_lishin 9 hours agoparent> You&#x27;d think depending on the person, they&#x27;d travel with EITHER their phone OR their iPad OR their laptop, depending on whether they are private people, non-technical \"creatives\" or IT&#x2F;technical&#x2F;dev folks, but instead, everybody appears to be travelling with ALL THREE devices insteadI can&#x27;t answer a call or text my family with my laptop while I&#x27;m on the go. I can&#x27;t plug my macbook into a car to use maps or play music. I can&#x27;t use my macbook on the beach to take a picture of my child playing in the surf. I can&#x27;t really use my phone to type out anything shorter than a quick text.(Caveat, for the pedants: yes, I could do all those things, but with terrible inconvenience.) reply eggy 20 minutes agorootparentI have an Asus ROG Zephyrus Duo as my main home and travel computer. I am upgrading my Samsung Ultra Note 20 to a Samsung Fold 5. I can work off of my Note now, and leave the Asus laptop at the place I am staying. I spent 6 months in Saudi Arabia working this way. You can run MS 365 and Dex on the phone. I use the Note to annotate photos in the field and to annotate during Zoom calls. I&#x27;ve typed proposals, spreadsheets, and more just on the phone. Because I do CAD, physics sims, and rendering, I can&#x27;t lose the laptop, but for everything else, I could get away with the phone. I think the Fold 5 will make it even more capable for what I use it for. I still have a 2015 iPad Pro, a 2011 27 in. iMac, but I&#x27;ve left the Apple ecosystem for a while now. Android, Windows, and Linux for me mainly in that order. reply mvdtnz 5 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it&#x27;s an American thing but I don&#x27;t think I know a single person who owns or uses an ipad, with the exception of rich parents who use them exclusively to distract children. I certainly don&#x27;t notice a lot of ipad users in airports or trains. reply bemusedthrow75 1 hour agorootparentI’m in the UK. Yesterday I watched an eighty-plus year old woman settle her similarly elderly, physically-impaired husband into his seat on the train then get out her iPad to write an email.On my journey home in a more crowded train I saw half a dozen iPads just from where I was sitting. They are extremely useful devices for train journeys. reply pbhjpbhj 49 minutes agorootparentOnly Apple iPads or are you using the term generically? I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re in London or another major city?Similar to the parent I only ever see iPads in two places, the hands of rich kids in restaurants, and in primary schools. reply GraemeMeyer 15 minutes agorootparentIn the UK you basically only see iPads (95%+). Android tablets aren’t common reply tzhenghao 29 minutes agorootparentprevThese days my parents based in Asia use the two iPads I gifted them almost exclusively. They watch YouTube videos, Netflix, Facetime the kids and browse the web on them. The only time my dad boots up my old college MacBook is when he has to do important document editing - never more than once every month. To my surprise, he&#x27;s even using the iPadOS Files app extensively. We&#x27;re just not the target market. reply fouc 4 hours agorootparentprevI notice it more on airplanes when people want to watch their own movies.I would also say that about 1&#x2F;3 of people that work primarily from their laptop, and travel a lot (no easy access to a desktop monitor), will probably have an iPad as a second display as well. reply mr_tombuben 1 hour agorootparentprevI use an iPad exclusively at home on a couch&#x2F;in bed. It&#x27;s really great for low effort media consumption&#x2F;web browsing, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine bringing it with me somewhere instead of just taking a laptop. Even for media consumption on a train or airplane, I prefer a laptop because of it being easier to prop up in a cramped space. reply nottorp 44 minutes agorootparentYep. I have an iPad (cheap, not pro) on my nightstand.I take the laptop when traveling because who knows what I&#x27;ll need it for. reply ErneX 2 hours agorootparentprevI see plenty of them around (Spain). reply camillomiller 4 hours agorootparentprevI think it’s generational. In Berlin I see plenty of students that now actively use it while studying in cafés for example. reply fouc 4 hours agorootparentYeah it&#x27;s amazing how many iPads + Apple Pencils students have these days. I notice this in Thailand universities as well. reply jdshaffer 3 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m seeing an increase in college students in Japan with iPads and Apple Pencils. And most of the visiting students from other countries have them for sure. reply mkaszkowiak 2 hours agorootparentpreviPads are often used by students for note taking, they seem to excel in this niche reply Razengan 2 hours agorootparentprevI have plenty of American friends who (including their kids) use iPads all the time, almost everywhere. reply IggleSniggle 8 hours agorootparentprevI had my \"single device for everything\" experience with the original Galaxy Note. I would plug in a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and use it as a computer (it required a special OTG USB to HDMI adapter). It connected to my car. It had a big enough screen to be a mobile Tv. It was fun for sketching with the included pressure sensitive pencil. I had a game-controller that it could click into, making it into a handheld game machine. And it had a graphics chip that gave it more graphics ability than comparable mobile computing devices of the time. It even had a cool thing where it could emulate and magnetic credit card swipe, making it compatible with credit card readers that didn&#x27;t yet support tap-to-pay! Truly a miracle device.Yet for all that, I replaced it with a Moto X just 2 years later, and it&#x27;s the Moto X that I really miss, with its superior voice control and its preference to remain in my pocket, and the little dimple in its wooden back. reply emodendroket 7 hours agorootparentDo-it-all devices tend to not really satisfy in anything. I got a Lenovo Yoga that was meant to be “convertible” between laptop and tablet and I never really did use it anywhere near as much as the technically much less powerful iPad Air I bought after. reply imhoguy 13 minutes agorootparentI keep old Yoga 13 in a drawer. I think it happened still too early for its time - too heavy as tablet, fans, small screen vs form factor, font hinting quite bad in vertical mode, Windows8 clunky interface, battery...I think today&#x27;s Macbook Air M2 with 360deg hinges, touch and some iPad like UI-mode would be a holy grail for the article author. reply PeterisP 1 hour agorootparentprev> I can&#x27;t answer a call or text my family with my laptop while I&#x27;m on the goThat&#x27;s interesting, for me, any texting (usually via whatsapp or signal) is far, far more convenient on the laptop than on the phone, so far that if I expect a longer response, I&#x27;ll rather find a place to sit and pull out the laptop than try to type all of it on the phone; and for calling people also videocalls on laptop are more convenient for me than the phone, so again, if it&#x27;s more than a one-minute conversation, I&#x27;ll rather put down the phone and call them through the laptop. reply makeitdouble 9 hours agorootparentprevParent&#x27;s point still stands as in a decent ecosystem you&#x27;d get down to at most two.For instance a phone and a Surface Pro covers 100% of the use cases, there&#x27;s no gap for a 3rd device. For some this gets down to one device with a Galaxy Fold and DEX.People might have different preferences and&#x2F;or be locked in the Apple ecosystem anyway, but we have working products showing things done differently (\"think different\" was such a good copy) reply nicbou 8 hours agorootparentThe iPad is a much better tablet than the Surface. The art and note apps are incomparably better. The ebook reader apps too.iPad OS is limited, but it&#x27;s fine for reading, writing and sketching. It&#x27;s good to do that on a separate device that is not connected to work stuff. I can bring my iPad in the bedroom because it&#x27;s just a fancy book.Windows is also far too needy for this sort of device. I returned my Surface after a day because of updates, notifications, tracking and a complete lack of respect for the user. My iPad is such a calm device by comparison. reply makeitdouble 7 hours agorootparentIt comes down what you actually want to do. My time spent on the iPad was defined by what I couldn&#x27;t do, and it was extremely frustrating, I ended up not doing it instead of go getting the laptop from across the house.Windows is not refined nor optimized for tablet use by any measure, but it actually does the job, instead of showing a cute and extremely refined middle finger half the time.The breaking point for me was the reader apps, where I&#x27;d have a file and just no way to read it, short of taking 10 min on a desktop to somewhat convert it to what the iPad can handle (see below). Since they&#x27;re also in a pissing match with Amazon, the reading experience is just subpar. What&#x27;s the point of a simple and elegant interface if I&#x27;m still babysitting what&#x27;s going in there and have to constantly think about work-arounds that also end up clunky and broken ?> Art and note appsAdobe suite, ClipStudio etc. are all there, in their actual, professional, full-blown version, and not some compromised \"on the go\" version. Same for One-note, obsidian etc., there&#x27;s no lack of them on Windows while it was a fresh market on the iPad.> ebook reader appsI think iBooks is the only reader you don&#x27;t get (is there a web version ? I have no idea).Granted I buy most of my books on kindle, the in-browser reader works well enough (in the end, I&#x27;m full screen turning pages, so makes no difference). I&#x27;d argue getting the read the book straight from the page I bought them is pretty great.I didn&#x27;t bother with the android subsystem version but it would be an option if there is any limitation on the web part. I also have a bunch of old ebooks and scans from way before there were stores, and of course they were better handled by the windows apps (at some point I was using CloudReader on iOS, and it just disappeared). reply numpad0 0 minutes agorootparent> > Art and note apps> Adobe suite, ClipStudio etc. are all there, in their actual, professional, full-blown versionSpeaking of those, does the Pencil still feel somewhat half baked for Apple? The display front panels on iPads aren&#x27;t \"optimized\" for pens, like, given rigidity and texturing for front panels. I don&#x27;t own the iPad kit nor am I a digital artist, but the Pencil as a physical object almost feels like poking acrylic panel with laundry hangars, and most third party feeling among all third party pens. and I didn&#x27;t understand how they could sell it as a serious thing. kaba0 57 minutes agorootparentprevFor what it’s worth, you can have ishell installed, put the file you want to convert into its drive, download almost any x86 binary to convert it, and you can use it, all from your ipad.Sure, not the most convenient way, but there is no replacing something like pandoc. reply emodendroket 6 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know about anyone else but my expectations are not for my iPad to be suitable for serious development work or whatever. I want to read books and magazines, surf the Web, and watch videos. And for that it’s arguably better than a laptop. At least I find myself using it for those things much more. reply nradov 5 hours agorootparentRight, but the inability to do serious software development is an arbitrary limit imposed by Apple. The hardware is quite capable, but the vendor has decided that we need to use multiple different devices. It&#x27;s their platform and they can do what they like with it, but as a customer those artificial limitations rankle. reply emodendroket 4 hours agorootparentThey’d have to do something more than just throw XCode on it for it to be in any way usable without full on keyboard and mouse, which would cut against what they’re trying to do. So there is some justification beyond just market segmentation. reply diffeomorphism 3 hours agorootparentWhy? Having xcode usable just with (their 350€+) keyboard seems perfectly acceptable. reply emodendroket 3 hours agorootparentFor the same reason they deliberately made iphone apps look bad -- they want applications designed to work with the device to make it a good experience and not applications designed for something else shoehorned in. I see some real wisdom in this approach considering how poor some of the alternative experiences are. Ultimately why would you buy it if it&#x27;s just an inferior laptop with a touchscreen that you can detach? reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparent> Ultimately why would you buy it if it&#x27;s just an inferior laptop with a touchscreen that you can detach?Right now it’s inferior not-a-laptop with a touchscreen that you can detach and people still buy it. replynicbou 6 hours agorootparentprev> Adobe suite, ClipStudio etc. are all there, in their actual, professional, full-blown version, and not some compromised \"on the go\" versionThis is what made me sell the Surface. I wanted to replace a paper notebook I bring everywhere. What I got was tiny buttons, menus, and a save dialog every time I wanted to close the app. My drawings were not drawings in a sketchbook, but files I had to manually sort and access on a filesystem.After spending a whole day installing updates and turning off ads and tracking, I couldn&#x27;t just unwind and doodle. The Surface constantly reminded me that I was operating a computer, not drawing.> ebooksThe in-browser reader is not a replacement for an offline book reader. This tablet is offline most of the time.> obsidianI want to write and doodle, not edit markdown files. Otherwise I&#x27;d have no use for a tablet. This tablet replaces a paper notebook. reply 8note 5 hours agorootparentMy surface is a whiteboarding tool.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.microsoft.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;sketchpal&#x2F;9MVT92NRF5...Does a pretty good job reply ricardobayes 3 hours agorootparentprevThe other competitors have just as much tracking, just windows makes it more transparent to opt in (to some of it), so it&#x27;s more visible. reply TheCoelacanth 7 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s just software, though. In a decent ecosystem you would be able to run any software you want on any device you want. reply emodendroket 6 hours agorootparentOftentimes being able to run whatever you want makes it harder to provide a cohesive, consistent experience that’s pleasant to use. Look at X vs. Mac or even Windows to see what I mean. The inconsistency of that experience has imo been a major factor holding back desktop Linux (notably, locked-down Linux-derived environments seem to do fine). reply ImPostingOnHN 0 minutes agorootparentthe two aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive, apple can give the consistent experience and also have an \"okay, you&#x27;re the owner of this device, you make the rules, not Steve Jobs\" setting that isn&#x27;t as beautiful but also doesn&#x27;t try to boss around the user gizajob 3 hours agorootparentprevYou forget that vast swathes of us are never going to risk buying a Microsoft&#x2F;Windows device ever again. They blew it too many times with BSOD &#x2F; updates kicking in during work &#x2F; viruses &#x2F; whatever horror this week. reply hahajk 9 hours agorootparentprevMore importantly for an airplane, you can&#x27;t watch Netflix (or most streaming movies) offline on a laptop. Though I&#x27;ve never used a Surface, maybe you can do that with some kind of mobile app that runs on a hybrid thing. reply orthoxerox 2 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s what files are for. reply raverbashing 1 hour agorootparentAh but the new generation doesn&#x27;t know what a \"file dialog\" is. I wish I was kidding reply j45 8 hours agorootparentprevNetflix seems to provide an app for Windows Laptops to watch titles offline.Chromebooks here too.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.netflix.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;node&#x2F;54816MacOS is absent, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not too far off using an Google Chromebook emulator with Google Play Store in UTM if it&#x27;s a must. reply WWLink 5 hours agorootparentthe M1&#x2F;M2 macs should be able to just run the iOS app. Not sure if it allows storing stuff. Or if netflix lets you run the ios app on a mac (probably not lol) reply fouc 4 hours agorootparentUnfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem like Netflix has allowed their app to show up in under the \"iPhone & iPad Apps\" section in the MacOS app store. reply j45 8 hours agorootparentprevScreen Mirroring is possible, but it has to be a little creative.iPad is super handy but I&#x27;m not sure a laptop has turn by turn nav, maybe it could via an emulator. reply ytjohn 7 hours agorootparentLong before mobile smart phones, truckers were using apps like copilot gps on their offline laptop for just this. I used to have it on a laptop for install work I did. In fact, I continued using it in areas with no cell coverage. Another app I used was Microsoft Streets and Trips. In 2006, they added a GPS version that did turn by turn nav.That said, the point still stands. I did some searching, and Streets and Trips are discontinued. Copilot was bought by Trimble and AFAIK, you can only get the mobile app versions (they still have offline support). I think their truck fleet software will still run on laptops, but are sold as part of a bulk purchase.I did find MapFactor, which I&#x27;ve never used, as being something that will work on Windows and Linux (via wine) and it provides real-time GPS navigation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mapfactor.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;navigation-software-st... reply zx8080 8 hours agorootparentprev> maybe it could via an emulatorAs a programmer with serious mobile experience I fully understand it. But it sound a bit crazy that a powerful and more superior (and open! In both hard and sometimes soft - if with an opensource OS) platform need so _emulate_ an embedded one (mobile, usually at least partially proprietary one) to provide turn-by-turn nav: what appears to be a first-order need of anyone in the modern world. reply PaulHoule 7 hours agorootparentI used to have a pink netbook that ran Microsoft Streets and Trips that I used together with a Bluetooth GPS. I had a power adapter that plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car and also a line in cable for the stereo. I could play music with Windows Media Player and have turn-by-turn directions work flawlessly. It was particularly good for road trips with a navigator in the passenger&#x27;s seat as it had a great user interface for managing large numbers of points of interest and making routes that hit multiple points. It was the best satnav I ever had.I remember the time I was heading south from Syracuse in an area notorious for state police speedtraps when I had pulled alongsides a greyhound and my son had logged into the WiFi on board the bus. The bus driver got pissed at us and got up to 95 mph to shake us. I gave up first but I figured he&#x27;d have a lot more to lose from getting a ticket than I would. reply selestify 3 hours agorootparentWhy would the bus driver know or care that you’re using their WiFi? reply HWR_14 1 hour agorootparentThe bus driver probably didn&#x27;t know or care about the wifi, just this car that kept strangely in pace with him. Maybe the driver thought OP was going to intentionally get in an accident for some insurance scam. reply dntrkv 4 hours agorootparentprevMost laptops don&#x27;t have GPS or accelerometer &#x2F; gyroscope. Would be useless for turn-by-turn without those. reply callalex 2 hours agorootparentBluetooth and USB positioning radios are dirt cheap and run on ancient stable standards. reply vetinari 43 minutes agorootparentIf your laptop has 3G (or better) radio, it has also positioning bundled in.However, although the devices might run on ancient stable standard, but that does not mean, that operating system is not playing silly games there. If you had an app that talked to them via serial port, you could throw it away once Microsoft introduced GNSS subsystem. reply nine_k 7 hours agorootparentprevNavigation from Google us not free.You can run OSM in navigation mode, I suppose. reply crazygringo 9 hours agoparentprev> You&#x27;d think depending on the person, they&#x27;d travel with EITHER their phone OR their iPad OR their laptopBut why would you think that?I don&#x27;t want to have to pull out my laptop (or even iPad) for phone calls or to check a quick e-mail.Obviously there are types of real serious work that can only be done on a laptop.And then I&#x27;m bringing the iPad to read books on, which takes up a lot less space than if the books were physical. It&#x27;s far nicer reading on the iPad than the other devices. It&#x27;s also far easier to position the way I want on my tray table for a movie.I have zero complaints. My phone doesn&#x27;t take space away from anything else, and my laptop+iPad together are slimmer and weigh less than a single laptop did in the pre-Air days. And much less when you consider I no longer bring physical books&#x2F;magazines. reply ChrisMarshallNY 7 hours agorootparent> a single laptop did in the pre-Air days.I used to travel with the first Apple Luggable[0] (and extra lead&#x2F;acid batteries).Times have changed.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Macintosh_Portable reply JohnBooty 7 hours agoparentprevnext [–]You&#x27;d think depending on the person, they&#x27;d travel with EITHER their phone OR their iPad OR their laptopYou&#x27;re missing a few major scenarios.- The iPad works as a second monitor for a Mac laptop. Great for creative&#x2F;tech people.- If people are traveling for work, they are bringing their work laptop which may have corporate lockdown&#x2F;spyware software installed. Therefore using their work laptop for entertainment might not be possible or optimal.

It necessarily has a smaller screen, no separate keyboard, and only has a decent battery life because it sleeps most of the time. It can have serious peak performance, but has a hard time sustaining it (ask Ingress players).An iPad (or another tablet if you feel fancy) is a two-hands device with a good, easy to use touchscreen, and software built around it. It&#x27;s a natural choice for a graphic artist, for instance. An iPad has a more tolerable onscreen keyboard than a phone. Also its screen is large enough to enjoy movies, etc, so it&#x27;s a convenient visual media consumption device, more so than a phone.

By the time the EU decided on their USB-C dictum, Apple -- a co-inventor and standards participant of USB-C -- had switched their laptops fully to USB-C, their desktops to USB-C, and half their pad line to USB-C, with the rest coming not long after. Most people fully expected the 14 to be USB-C just because it was starting to be silly, and by the 15 it would be ridiculous if they still had lightning.Apple was already switching. Which is exactly why the EU could go ahead and faced little resistance. The EU deserves zero credit.And FWIW, the EU in 2010 dictated that all smartphones use micro-USB. Apple provided an adapter as they moved their entire line to lightning, thankfully, as micro-USB was a garbage connector in every way. reply Dylan16807 6 hours agorootparentI doubt they would have switched on the same timeframe. They dragged their feet for so long and they also fought against this regulation.And they saw it coming, so doing prep work doesn&#x27;t show they wanted to change.A big part of the reason people thought Apple would change is because everyone knew these rules were coming.Also I don&#x27;t think micro-USB ever got mandated, and 2010 was before lightning even existed.And given the pin burnout problems I&#x27;m not even sure if micro USB is worse than lightning with USB 2.0 reply llm_nerd 5 hours agorootparentApple moving the iPhone to USB-C was incredibly obvious, even if you ignore the recurring noise about the EU.

The iPad started switching in 2018. Thunderbolt 3 & 4, created by Apple and Intel use USB-C.And yes, the EU dictum before was a voluntary agreement, and Apple provided an adapter and then went from the bad 30-pin to the much better lightning.

Also nice to hold a document one is working on in landscape so that it looks like it&#x27;s on paper, yet remains interactive. Yeah I get it&#x27;s kind of hamstrung and annoyingly clunky in a way that you&#x27;d think apple could resolve, but still think as a device it&#x27;s pretty remarkable, and still got loads of potential for getting better, somehow.I think I&#x27;m going to try laying out my next book using Affinity Publisher - I used the Mac version to lay out the last one so hope I can do the same while finding benefits for doing so with my little paddy.One other side benefit is that the iPad somehow seems incongruous - with a laptop out in public you&#x27;re \"working\" yet with an iPad you&#x27;re somehow perceptually not.Plus, iPad coupled with Library Genesis is awesome.

Strange though, how the iPad is ostensibly a much better device given the touchscreen and keyboard (and now pencil) and yet remains somehow less useful than a MacBook.

I don&#x27;t know what creative solutions you&#x27;re talking about but unless we&#x27;re talking about things making art with limited colors and resolutions which is only necessary because that&#x27;s what the customer has, there is not much point in limiting oneself artificially unless you are truly stuck otherwise or are doing it for its own sake on some sort of metaphysical quest reply gizajob 2 hours agorootparentIn the case of music and recording, often times better and more creative records were made by people having to devise complicated solutions to having technology with huge limitations - a famous example being that Sgt Pepper by the Beatles was made using tape machines that were limited to four tracks. Hence those involved had to think deeply and be inspired to find solutions to “defeat the machine” (in the words of Paul McCartney). Compare this to the state of affairs today where people are virtually “gods” in terms of power - the number of audio tracks, sounds, editing capabilities of someone using Logic is essentially unlimited, and yet music hasn’t responded very much to the technology because now the machine is incredible and powerful to the point where it basically cannot be defeated - almost nobody can even come close to utilising the power and capabilities offered. We haven’t had an explosion of novel forms and a wealth of newness, people just use them to clone what was produced in the past but cheaper and more quickly. The horizon of the canvas of a DAW is really too huge to ever get to the end of, and it’s almost overwhelming for most artists to rise to the challenge of, so they just stick with the limitations and live an easier life. There’s been no great flourishing of 21st century music with the emergence of this power, we’re mostly stuck in forms and genres created in the 20th century.There’s also an analogous situation in hip-hop with the very limited SP-1200 and MPC 60 samplers. They don’t do much but what they do, they do well, so it’s up to producers to work to that and try to transcend it. Having an unlimited workspace in the computer to replicate the same doesn’t lead to better hip hop.So you’re right to invoke metaphysics, because the machines have a kind of ontology, same as the mode of life of the artists using them. It doesn’t have to be a metaphysical quest, but there can be better and more interesting ways of creating on limited tools, particularly if you’ve used them for a long time. Some writers such as Jean Baudrillard stuck with typewriters as a writing tool long after the introduction of the desktop computer (he died in 2007) because he found it was simpler and better, less distracting, more focussed on the word and him. You could invoke the same “omfg you could be pasting in hyperlinks and doing referencing and surfing at the same time you’re just doing it for your own sake!” toward someone like that, but actually it’s not for its own sake, he only needs to think and produce text and it’s the perfect tool for that, the computer is only ever pretending to be a typewriter and comes with a load of noise and headache alongside. reply iraqmtpizza 1 hour agorootparentDid Beethoven make his best stuff after he went deaf (genuinely curious; I&#x27;m inherently Beethskeptical after being Toccata-Fugue-D-minor-pilled)?

Oh and you could draw on it!The original iPad did NONE OF THAT. However, the current iPad does have a slick magnetic keyboard, a usb-c port, and you can draw on it with the apple pencil. Plus I think there are many more apps developed for iOS than there are for Windows - especially involving tablet use cases.So I don&#x27;t think the Surface Pro is really needed anymore. I&#x27;m not sure Microsoft is even interested in continuing to make them in the long run (but I may be wrong!)The other thing - I keep saying this: MS isn&#x27;t interested in consumers. They just aren&#x27;t. Their primary interest is selling Office 365, Azure 365, AD hosting, etc to businesses.

The regulators won, at least for now. VIGGY BALAGOPALAKRISHNAN AUG 25, 2023 8 1 Share Every few decades, major shifts happen that change how an industry fundamentally operates, and who the new winners and losers are. We are in the midst of one such shift in the digital advertising industry. This has been driven by three critical changes in the ecosystem, all privacy-related: Apple announced the App Tracking Transparency framework in 2021 Google is deprecating third party cookies in 2024 A slew of privacy legislation is either already in place (like the California Privacy Rights Act, EU General Data Protection Regulation) or is about to be in place (like the EU Digital Services Act) While the effects of these changes have been felt by the advertising industry globally, the EU in particular has been at war with behavioral advertising for a few years now. And winning. In the past three weeks, there have been significant announcements from Meta, Snap and TikTok about upcoming changes to their products in the EU. It’s probably fair to say these changes mark the end of an era for behavioral advertising in the EU, and the platforms have made peace with that. In this piece, we’ll dive into: How the advertising ecosystem runs (or used to run) Privacy interventions and impact on behavioral advertising EU’s war on behavioral advertising and why platforms are conceding Possible future paths Thanks for reading Unpacked! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Subscribe How the advertising ecosystem runs (or used to run) Let’s start with some simple concepts. An ad shown to you can be contextual or behavioral (sometimes both). A contextual ad is something that is shown alongside organic results (non-ads) in the context of whatever you are doing. For example, if you are on a food delivery app like DoorDash and you see an ad for a restaurant alongside organic results, that is a contextual ad. In that case, your identity doesn’t really matter. DoorDash knows your location and what you’re looking for, and therefore shows you a relevant ad. Knowing your identity and interests does help improve relevance of these ads but it’s secondary to the context itself. A behavioral ad is something that’s shown to you because of your past behavior. For example, you might have visited an office chair brand’s page on Instagram and therefore you get served ads for another office chair brand; that’s exactly what happened to me with the ad on the right. This can either be based on direct behavior (like the office chair example), or inferred behavior - people like you that looked for chairs also looked for monitors. One step further, people that looked at chairs are also likely to work from home more and therefore open to a lunch service. All of those are potential ads that can be shown to you. Contextual ad on DoorDash (left) vs Behavioral ad on Instagram Stories (right) A subset of products, most often search products, are perfect for contextual ads - Google Maps, Google Search, DoorDash, Yelp, Thumbtack, TripAdvisor, Zocdoc to name a few. The user has high intent to do something specific. However, most high intent products are low-medium frequency. You are not looking for plumbers every day on Thumbtack and you are not looking to order food delivery every hour of the day on DoorDash, and therefore the amount of contextual ad inventory is lower - highly effectively but lower in volume. On the other hand, social media platforms where users spend hours doomscrolling have a large volume of non-contextual inventory. Random ads are annoying and ineffective, and therefore the most effective way to monetize this inventory is through behavioral ads. Unsurprisingly, behavioral ads require a lot of data, and specifically data about you. Before ~2018 (when EU’s GDPR kicked in), there was essentially free flow of data about you, collected through a long list of highly effective AdTech mechanisms. Some notable examples: Every iOS or Android phone had a unique “mobile advertising ID” assigned to it (and by association, to you). This ID was accessible to all apps on your device, i.e. your Uber app and your Google Maps app both knew you are mobile advertising ID 123, and could easily cross-identify you across apps. Most browsers (except Safari and Firefox) supported “third party cookies”, which is essentially a piece of data that one site could place on your browser and another site could access. There would be a “cookie ID” associated with you and you could be easily cross-identified across websites. Note that these identifiers, for all practical purposes, were permanent. You could go deep inside your settings and reset these IDs but most people never do that. This resulted in a couple of second order effects: Companies that are “data brokers” started purchasing data from several different data providers and building “profiles” about you; for example, app 1 could tell the broker that you bought an expensive piece of furniture, website 2 could tell them you have an account with a high end bank, and the data broker could put that together and categorize you as “high propensity of spend” person; note that when I say “you”, that refers to your identifiers (mobile advertising ID or third party cookie ID) As more and more data became available, the profiles had more fidelity to them and identification became more sophisticated; for example, if app 1 had your mobile advertising ID and website 2 had your Chrome third party cookie ID, a data broker or an ad platform could compare your your IP addresses and know it is the same person. Take this one step further. A data broker could also use a third data source and find an email associated with your IDs. One more step further, they could buy your address from a utility or telecom company and find your address. This might sound far-fetched but it’s not - device graphs are a very commonly used data product in the AdTech stack today, and telecom companies are notorious for selling your data. If you need a more entertaining take, check out John Oliver’s episode on data brokers. Attribution / measurement of advertising campaigns became more and more precise; through a combination of technical mechanisms, an advertiser could say you first saw an ad on Facebook, then an ad on Google Search, then a display ad on NYTimes, and eventually bought an item from their website, so each of those three advertising platforms get shared credit While this sounds privacy invasive (and it is), this resulted in a highly efficient advertising ecosystem. Advertisers knew exactly which users they were targeting and since they had all these extra behavioral signals to know how likely a user was to engage, they were willing to pay higher cost per impressions (CPM) for ad inventory, thereby generating more revenue for a media publisher. Precise attribution / measurement turbo charged this further. However, you can see how this was becoming the wild west - highly effective advertising no doubt but also an uncontrolled orgy of data acquired with non-existent or questionable user consent. This rightfully raised concerns about data consolidation in the hands of both data brokers and large technology companies, and an intervention was inevitable. It was less a matter of if and more a matter of when. Privacy interventions and impact on behavioral advertising Let’s dive into each of the three privacy interventions that arose in an attempt to tame the wild west. First, Apple introduced the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. It sounds jargon-y but the change is relatively simple. Prior to ATT, every app by default had access to your advertising ID, i.e. it was opt-in by default. This meant you could easily be tracked across apps, and therefore shown effective behavioral ads. For example, you installed the Strava app to track your runs, you are now on Facebook, and you are shown an ad for Strava Premium. After ATT, the access to this identifier became opt-out by default, i.e. an app had to show you a pretty aggressive prompt to get access to your identifier and you explicitly needed to say yes. The average opt-in rate ended up close to ~34% (with a lot of caveats). Apple’s tracking consent prompt We won’t go into much detail here but this prompt was launched by Apple in the guise of embracing privacy - a smart chess move. The consensus opinion today is that this was an opportunistic move from Apple, which no doubt improves privacy but also heavily hurts Apple’s competitors as they prop up their own ads business. The impact was that user identity was available much less often. Note here that for behavioral advertising to happen in the Strava-Facebook example, there is not one but two apps that needs to have received opt-in from you, i.e. the addressable market does not drop to 34%, it drops to 34% * 34% = ~12%. Therefore, cross-app behavioral advertising on iOS is no longer effective at scale. Second, Google announced that they will deprecate third-party cookies in 2024. The consensus opinion is that the change helps Google achieve a dual purpose: appease regulators who are breathing down their neck for potential anti-trust behavior in AdTech, while taking control back from what’s now a fairly bloated advertising tech stack. Google’s new mechanisms post third-party cookies will still allow cross-site retargeting but in a more private way where all information is stored on-device within the browser, i.e. there are no more cross-site “cookie IDs” assigned to you. While the new mechanism preserves some of the status quo, cross-site behavioral advertising is going to have much less fidelity and therefore effectiveness. Which brings us to the third intervention - privacy regulations. The most aggressive of these is EU’s GDPR, which went into effect in 2018. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) went into effect in 2020. While the progression has been gradual, the reason these laws matter for advertising companies today more that ever is because the laws take aim at the only remaining and mission critical advertising mechanism - behavioral advertising within companies’ own apps (i.e. you do a bunch of different things inside the Facebook app and Facebook gets to use that data to show you behavioral ads within the app). EU’s war on behavioral advertising and why platforms are conceding A primary feature that makes the California laws (arguably the strictest privacy law in the US) less aggressive than EU’s GDPR is that it does not require explicit opt-ins and only requires platforms to provide opt-outs. For example, the 2020 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires companies that are considered “data sellers” under the law to provide explicit opt-outs on web pages, but the default is still opt-in. EU’s GDPR takes this up another notch and requires explicit opt-in / consent for behavioral advertising. This consent needs to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous. For example, Meta cannot gate content behind a behavioral advertising consent prompt. So, the simplistic inference from this is that Meta needs to get explicit consent for all behavioral understanding, including the last remaining mechanism - showing ads within their own platform. If Meta is forced to do this, the opt in will likely be small (the Apple opt in rates were ~34%) and this majorly shrinks Meta’s addressable advertising market in the EU. To not meet that fate, Meta made a creative legal argument: GDPR requires any company to have one of six legal bases if the company needs to process personal data. Paraphrasing, these are - consent, necessity to fulfill a contract, necessity for legal compliance, necessity to protect vital interests of the user, necessity to perform a public interest task, and necessity for legitimate interests pursued by the company Of these six, Meta held the stance that they were processing personal data using “legitimate interests” (the last of the six) as the legal basis, and therefore does not need to show an explicit opt-in prompt Last month, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority provided their enforcement decision that Meta’s use of “legitimate interests” as the legal basis is not valid. Paraphrasing the enforcement decision: Based on several past court rulings, Meta must prove that legitimate interest “cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by other means less restrictive of the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects” Based on another past court ruling, despite the face that Meta provides a free service, the user of that network cannot reasonably expect that the operator of the social network will process that user’s personal data, without his or her consent, for the purposes of personalized advertising Four days after the Norwegian Data Protection Authority’s ruling, Meta announced that they will be changing their legal basis from “legitimate interests” to “consent”. In practice, what this means is that Meta is conceding that behavioral advertising within their own app in the EU can no longer be opt-in by default. While Apple’s changes significantly cut down the ability to advertise cross-app, Meta was holding on to hope that it would be able to preserve all in-app behavioral advertising (including in the EU), and the writing is now on the wall. Snap, TikTok followed suit shortly after with their own announcements that non-personalized versions of their products will soon be available to users. A total of 19 platforms that are in scope are likely to follow suit. Possible future paths It is still to be seen what percent of users opt into behavioral advertising. If the Apple opt-in rates are any indication, it may get to the ~34% rate seen there but it may also go higher if platforms are allowed to be creative about opt-in language and user interfaces. It is hard to say what exactly the long-term effects of ending the opt-in-by-default regime for behavioral advertising in the EU will be, but here are some educated guesses: Explicit preferences instead of inferred interests - Meta has made some progress towards letting users provide inputs to the feed algorithm. I would expect the creation of more explicit preferences / interests that users explicitly select. While it has worked to a smaller extent for some products like Reddit, it is likely that the quality of content provided by just preferences will be nowhere close to the relevance of a system that is constantly ingesting data and inferring interests. Non-personalized feeds: TikTok has announced that they will create a non-personalized feed that is based on what’s popular in your region. Most social feed-based platforms will also (re)introduce simplistic ranking options like chronological. I am not bullish any of these will create an engaging user experience. Degraded user experience, leading to more opt-in: My (potentially contentious) take is that opted out users will see a significantly degraded experience and eventually decide to provide platforms consent to personalize. The platforms will likely use this mechanism to receive content for all personalization (including behavioral advertising) - it’s unclear if there are any regulatory constraints that force them to not bundle consent for user experience personalization and behavioral advertising. I don’t expect the consent rate to go anywhere close to status quo but I think it will be a meaningful bump to what’s seen with Apple’s opt in rates. Experiments with subscriptions: Twitter launched Twitter Verified a few months back, and Meta is experimenting with a similar concept. I am not bullish that a majority (or even a minority) of users will be willing to pay for social media products after years of being conditioned to getting these products for free. De-prioritization of EU markets: If platforms are not able to effectively monetize the EU market, it is likely that they will start de-prioritizing investments for the EU market, which is a real risk of an aggressive regulatory regime. I don’t expect them to stop supporting EU markets but every new feature built is an investment, and companies will start heavily questioning if they are willing to do any extra work for this market. For example, if there’s additional work to make a feature comply with GDPR, that might not be worth it anymore. We have seen other equivalent situations of this - several apps have a much better experience on iOS than Android because iOS apps monetize better. Conclusion The advertising market exploded over the last several decades due to availability of essentially infinite user data, which brought both large efficiencies in advertising and major privacy risks. Regulation was necessary. Great regulation is about finding the balance between promoting innovation / letting new businesses emerge that move society forward, and having guardrails so people are protected. Did the EU go too far? I personally think they did, and if that is true, the effects will start showing in a 5-10 year horizon and course correction will follow. Until then, this is the new reality of behavioral advertising in the EU. The regulators and legislators came all guns blazing, and they won. Thanks for reading Unpacked!

It says, \"Only use data you need for the operation of your business. If you collect any other data, you have to ask users for consent. Consent has to be informed, and it must be as easy to say no as it is to say yes\"> Why is this not the case?Because the companies think that tracking you and selling your data on theopen market is their god-given right.And the standard is literally already there: it&#x27;s called GDPR. reply dgb23 7 minutes agorootparentI’m not attacking the law.

Behavioral advertising is related because it requires tracking, and tracking requires the consent and understanding of users in the EU. There was (is) a huge dependence on US software in Europe, that&#x27;s probably why there was some reluctance at the start in enforcing it.

It&#x27;s an implicit bargain for most people, not an explicit one.For me, advertising crossed that line a long time ago.

I work in the industry and this article is very even handed but still a bit off.We don&#x27;t really have have a term for \"behavioral\" advertising. So a lot of things are being lumped together that don&#x27;t necessarily fit.For example, Facebook USED to be highly valued because of the amount of \"targeting\" (again, we don&#x27;t use the term \"behavioral\") data they had. When you went to tell FB what you liked and didn&#x27;t like they used that. They also kept that valuable data under lock and key - they have no interest in sharing it.Things are a bit different now. Since they and everyone else switched to an endless \"doomscrolling\" experience, all that data is worthless. No one keeps their likes up to date, no one engages with content. So there&#x27;s really not that much targeting (\"behavioral\") data out of FB anymore. So native ads are less effective, but people look at much more.\"Data brokerages\" are pretty niche. They don&#x27;t exist to the extent that people think they do. And the data they provide is often absolute garbage. Users switch phones, emails, numbers way too often to actually get anything resembling a permanent \"lock\". Marketing data ages FAST. Do you go to a store and find they have an address that is like 4 moves old? That&#x27;s kind of the quality of brokerage data - it&#x27;s good for filling in gaps, but is not nearly as valuable as first-party data.So part of what you are seeing is not necessarily advertisers responding to upcoming EU regulations, but organic changes in what sort of advertising is even effective anymore. Third party cookies are not as useful as they used to be, and they cut into the big advertisers&#x27; monopolies on user data. So they are being phased out anyway.> Attribution &#x2F; measurement of advertising campaigns became more and more preciseThis is the exact opposite of what is happening in the industry. There are so many different data sources that all conflict that data quality is often very dire in most large organizations. So there is a ton of fraud and snake oil used to justify advertising budgets.However, where the author hits the nail on the head I think are future outcomes: EU markets are being deprioritized (it doesn&#x27;t hurt that economically, consumer wealth in Europe is falling like a rock).

These laws apply to all EU based companies while non-EU companies have the clear option to opt out of them, which many do. If you want to do business within the EU, then you need to respect citizen privacy. Though I do agree that they should eat their own medicine, but here in the EU, we do tend to view private corporations as less worthy of our data than our own governments.That being said.

There was a mental model that you can&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s going to resonate with a person until you have their life under a microscope. This the \"surveillance capitalism\" take.There&#x27;s a view, perhaps not universally shared, that humans may not actually be as complicated as all that. That if you have a person play a short game, engage in a chat session a few minutes long, swipe on people they find interesting, or even just pay careful attention to how much of a video someone watches -- that discerning their personality and interests is challenging but totally viable.Let&#x27;s remember: the Cambridge Analytica debacle didn&#x27;t stem from a full dump of someone&#x27;s private Facebook history - it was mainly personality tests that were very quick to complete. It turned out that such a quick & casual test is mostly sufficient signal to be actionable re: how they were likely to vote and how to influence that vote.In this mode, we&#x27;ll see the rise of superapps that have rich ways of engaging and rich telemetry to discern your interests without having to \"snoop\" on you.

The consumer expects entertaining and unbiased information and the advertiser expects the consumer to buy something.One example how this conflict plays out: The youtuber Colin Furze tells people about Surfshark, a VPN solution. The way he does is funny (being in a bathtub with a shark mascot and his dark grey tie on), but I am not sure whether this is enlightening and useful information,Because of this conflict I think there will always be some tension. One example is that one extension for Youtube marks these parts as advertisement and enables skipping it. And sometimes I feel the need to skip it. When thinking about it, it is because I don&#x27;t want to listen to it and try to separate the information I am after from advertisement I am not willing to listen to it.So I still think that the pull model is the best way.

The fundamental idea of advertising is certainly a win-win sort of deal: informing people of products and services they may not be aware of.But most advertising is not that.

But YouTube, TikTok, etc have all seen great success in organic&#x2F;viral campaigns (Old Spice comes to mind).To answer your question - how might a superapp make advertisement \"good\" would probably be not only showing you an ad that you&#x27;re likely to commercially engage (to purchase the good&#x2F;service) based on your observed interests but also where the ad itself is something you&#x27;re likely to find interesting&#x2F;educational&#x2F;amusing and not annoying, because in the latter case you&#x27;ll like&#x2F;comment&#x2F;reshare to percolate it \"for free\" and amplify their campaign.

That doesn&#x27;t really count as \"privacy-preserving\" in my book, but I understand what you&#x27;re saying. reply Barraketh 13 hours agoprevSo one issue that this article glosses over is how contextual advertising interacts with attribution.Essentially, as an advertiser, in order to do effective contextual advertisement, you need to have some idea of how ads perform in a particular context - on a particular web page or app. So what you would really like to say is that \"people who saw our ad on X were Y% more likely to visit or website, or buy our product\". However, in order to actually measure that, when a user comes to your website you need to know which of your ads they&#x27;ve seen. Traditionally, you&#x27;d just serve the ad from your domain and set a cookie, but now you can&#x27;t do that.This is more relevant to brand advertising than \"click here and buy product X\" (direct response), but I think that the people saying \"oh, just use contextual advertising\" are underestimating the extent to which GDPR makes contextual advertising difficult. reply JohnFen 13 hours agoparent> However, in order to actually measure that, when a user comes to your website you need to know which of your ads they&#x27;ve seen.That may be the case, but so what? If an industry can&#x27;t function without abusing people, I would argue that it shouldn&#x27;t function.But this doesn&#x27;t mean the industry can&#x27;t function. It just means that advertising becomes less efficient (i.e., more expensive). Which is fine -- if it&#x27;s more expensive to operate in a manner that approaches being ethical, I don&#x27;t see that as a real problem. reply Barraketh 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s just that the word \"abuse\" is doing a lot of work in that statement. I&#x27;ve still never seen any example of any person being actually damaged by the \"tracking\", so calling it \"abuse\" feels pretty harsh. reply JohnFen 12 hours agorootparentI think \"abuse\" is a fair term, but I acknowledge that it&#x27;s emotionally loaded.

Advertising ideally works as match making by connecting buyers to sellers where the seller is unaware of the buyer. (i.e. the unknown unknown problem). Companies usually collect advertisements and place them on limited ad slots.2. In earlier, physical, forms of advertising such as newspapers, TV, Retail Stores etc, the same ad used to be shown to everyone so ad slots were fewer, much more expensive, and typically only big businesses could afford them.3. In Digital ads where ads can be personalised to users, there are now a lot more ad slots and small businesses could effectively reach out to niche buyers who otherwise wouldn&#x27;t be aware of them. The ads are thus cheaper as their budget is better focused on the right users.4. Digital ads are broadly of 2 types: Intent ads, where the user submits their intent (Eg: Google search, Amazon, Maps etc) or Discovery ads, where the user is typically not present for any single intent (Eg: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube etc)5. Discovery based ads in particular can help open up completely new behaviours (in an ideal world) where the seller wasn&#x27;t aware of the buyer&#x27;s product but found it very useful (i.e. The unknown unknown problem)6. Both Intent and discovery ads can be harmful to the user. Intent ads basically charge a tax to prioritise their results (i.e. rent seeking: pay more to jump the queue). Discover ads degrade the user experience (i.e They could&#x27;ve shown you something more interesting but decided to show you something less interesting to you and received money for it from a 3rd party).Some opinions below:1. Making digital ads more like physical ads (Eg: By removing personalisation) will probably benefit big businesses by increasing ad prices and making it harder to match sellers to buyers. It&#x27;s often small businesses who have a niche which increase competition in a market (The Innovators Dilemma)2. In the EU&#x27;s case, the ads can be personalised, just not based on behaviour but on context. So this will probably still increases prices but still not change digital ads fundamentally (i.e. they can still be personalised somewhat to the user) at least for now. reply di4na 13 hours agoparentNote that you have an unshown assumption here.That none of the participants lie and that you can infer niche effectively from the data. And that the ad can deliver the behaviour changeThe ads are only cheaper if they actually find the niche people and change the behaviour. Otherwise you spent money for nothing.The problem is that we have pretty good hunch from a bundle of clues that the data and org that validate these assumptions are lying.We also have pretty good bundle of clues from the consumers that the ads are not hitting their niche pretty well.So... We have an industry that breach privacy and lie, for a purported benefit based on seemingly false assumptions.Maybe the results are not achieved. reply ppsreejith 13 hours agorootparent1. Modern digital ads can be very well measured. At least the ones focused on direct conversion and not branding. Advertisers can measure the impact of their spending independently and the results can be seen fairly quickly. (Again, not brand advertising).2. Advertisement match-making isn&#x27;t perfect (which is why I wrote \"in an ideal world\"). There is some time and signal buffer till we get enough signal to show the right ad to the user (if ever). The intentions of the ad platform also have to be taken into consideration (Often not the case for Big Tech but even here).3. Advertisements do have negative consequences. We can also target drugs, cults, gambling etc more effectively as well. Often the law has to play catch-up with the more controversial categories. Advertisers can also dupe&#x2F;defraud buyers with false&#x2F;misleading advertisements. reply Krasnol 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ve missed the main negative part: the attack on our attention and mindfulness.I really hope that the results of neurologic research won&#x27;t take much longer to put an end to this disgusting behavior, which attacks central parts of the consciousness of every victim.(Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Thomas_Metzinger) reply ponderings 5 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s about margins.

Everything below is out. Then we have a market with advertisement budgets ranging from 1 to 85 euro per box. These expensive boxes make a hell of a lot of noise! The customer is left choosing between the 80+ and the 60-70 euro screamers.And then, then they go to AliExpress and buy it for 8 euro from someone who wants out and you&#x27;ve made us all look stupid.And now a moment of silence for the thousands who failed to want paperclips regardless of systemic encouragement. reply spookie 12 hours agoparentprev> In earlier, physical, forms of advertising such as newspapers, TV, Retail Stores etc, the same ad used to be shown to everyone so ad slots were fewer, much more expensive, and typically only big businesses could afford them.Well, my local newspaper shows ads for family businesses, and they don&#x27;t pay that much for it.

Yes, the encryption model theoretically remains secure, but 1) Signal now uploads your contact list to their servers and claims it is secured by Intel’s secure enclave, but multiple vulnerabilities have been found in that, and 2) if targeted, most users are defenseless against a malicious update. Meanwhile, WhatsApp, which is heavily used by EU citizens, claims end-to-end encryption, but it leaks metadata and also chat content is leaked through the automated backups that most users don’t disable.The only question is to what extent Five Eyes members besides the US get access to all that.

I&#x27;m pretty sure I am a hugely interesting target for many, many companies, but I am simply not interested in them (and never will) because other companies have much better products&#x2F;services (many of which I already use).I am assuming, of course, that the only reason they&#x27;re interested in targeting ads to me, is to influence me to make a buying decision that I wouldn&#x27;t do otherwise, and not just because I wasn&#x27;t aware of the product&#x2F;service. Because if it wasn&#x27;t for influencing me making a buying decision, why would they spend the money to show me an ad?That&#x27;s why I always try to ignore (and block) ads as much as possible, even though that&#x27;s not always possible (e.g. street ads). Yet, I am still being bombarded with non-stop ads and I have no question that I&#x27;m being negatively influenced by them, especially in those areas I know very little about (e.g. cleaning products) or am susceptible to being influenced against my own interests (e.g. fast food or other crappy, addictive food products).In my experience, the success rate of my own research (when looking for a product&#x2F;service) or even word-of-mouth recommendations has far, far outweighed the success rate of all the ad campaigns I&#x27;ve ever been a target of, from my own perspective (not from the companies&#x27; perspectives, of course).So it&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t see any value in advertising, which I don&#x27;t (unless you&#x27;re the advertiser), it&#x27;s that I think it&#x27;s actively damaging to society (due to leading people to make bad buying decisions) and the economy in general (due to increased inefficiency). reply ppsreejith 2 hours agorootparentThanks, this does mirror my experience in many ways so I&#x27;ll try to reply to each of your points.

It's just as fast now. You, however, may not be as fast. Just saying. Psygnosis / Dominic Szablewski 99 WITH There have been a lot of Wipeout games released since the 1995 original, including Wipeout HD and the Omega Collection, but only the original has the distinction of having its Windows port source code leaked by (since defunct) archive Forest of Illusion. Dominic Szablewski grabbed that code before it disappeared and set about creating a version that’s not just a port. He rewrote the game’s rendering, physics, sound, and generally “everything everywhere.” He documented the project, put his code on GitHub, and has some version of a justification. “So let's just pretend that the leak was intentional, a rewrite of the source falls under fair use and the whole thing is abandonware anyway,” Szablewski writes. Most of the code seemed to come from Wipeout ATI 3D Rage Edition, a “lackluster port for Windows” that was bundled with ATI GPUs, Szablewski wrote. It is a mess. There are fragments of code versions from DOS, PlayStation, Windows 95, and Windows 98, with lots of things shakily patched in, including some kludgey 25-to-30 frames-per-second physics calculations in moving from European PAL to North American NTSC. The result was bad geometry, sluggish performance, and even goofed text rendering. Not that he doesn’t have sympathy. “The code may not be pretty, but the result justifies it all,” he wrote. The PSX launch title braved unseen hardware and 3D models and physics and holds up today. But this pack-in version “is some caffeine-induced nightmare code written under immense time pressure. The 5000 lines of if else that handles the menu state is a striking witness to this insanity.” Advertisement The menu seems so simple, you'd never guess it was once 5,000 lines of code. Psygnosis / Dominic Szablewski Cruising along, hearing someone in a British voice mutter \"Missile\" at me, as if he was shopping for one at Tesco. Psygnosis / Dominic Szablewski The first-person view in Wipeout is like a little difficulty boost. Psygnosis / Dominic Szablewski Your author will not be completing this game for full review, as it is both nearly 30 years old and also he is bad at it. Psygnosis / Dominic Szablewski Previous Slide Next Slide As he digs into the specifics of his work, Szablewski takes the reader on a tour of PSX dev kits and how they handled Z-levels, how to translate yesterday’s triangles to today’s OpenGL, breaking the 30 FPS cap on a game that explicitly forbade that, and more. He takes the code from 40,699 lines to 7,731 and notably loved an excuse to work in C. “I had an absolute blast cleaning up this mess!” Szablewski’s Wipeout rewrite can be compiled for Windows, Linux, Mac, and WASM (Web Assembly). You can even play it in your browser on his server (please be gentle). I spent some time in it this morning, and let me tell you: I am not ready for anti-gravity racing in the year 2052. It was a struggle to even get to fourth place, but those struggles were due entirely to skill, not system. The web version feels buttery smooth, even when you’re continually clunking into walls. I had misremembered this game as having a lot more to it, but it’s all feel: the trance/prog music, the physics, the controls, and the sense that you’re always just slightly out of control. What about Sony and their legions of lawyers? Szablewski writes that Sony has “demonstrated a lack of interest in the original” Wipeout, so he doesn’t expect to hear much. “If anyone at Sony is reading this, please consider that you have (in my opinion) two equally good options: either let it be, or shut this thing down and get a real remaster going. I’d love to help!” READER COMMENTS 99 WITH KEVIN PURDY Kevin is a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, covering a variety of technology topics and reviewing products.

Author is way too modest to point out that it’s a stunning achievement. reply _a_a_a_ 16 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m sorry, 6,000 FPS? How is that possible? reply squeaky-clean 16 hours agorootparentIt means it&#x27;s calculating 6000 frames per second, but all of them don&#x27;t need to make it to the screen. On a 60hz screen, every 100th frame calculated would actually be displayed. (If we assume a perfect 6000fps, the video shows fluctuations between 4000fps-7000fps.If you just mean how can it be so high in general? Old, well optimized, games run really well on faster modern hardware. I remember getting over 1,000 fps in Guild Wars 1 on a GTX 1060 when looking at an area with no monsters&#x2F;NPCs.edit( this paragraph doesn&#x27;t apply here) ~~The PS1 also doesn&#x27;t have floating point math, mostly everything is done in fixed point with integer math which is obscenely fast compared to floating point (it could also simulate an FPU if the precision is absolutely necessary but that&#x27;s not suitable for realtime)~~Just read further down the article that they converted it to float. I guess the game is just super optimized. I would have thought fixed point savings factored in here. reply _a_a_a_ 16 hours agorootparent> all of them don&#x27;t need to make it to the screenah gotcha, thanks. The bandwidth would have to be terabytes&#x2F;sec. Come to think of it, pretty dumb of me to think they did. reply squeaky-clean 16 hours agorootparentNah, most people would probably not think of unseen frames being generated unless you&#x27;re into studying your graphics performance.It also technically does make a difference in some games. Even if the frames don&#x27;t make it to the screen, if your mouse polls at 1000hz then you can get more precise input tracking by rendering up to 1000fps. It&#x27;s something only really noticeable to professional gamers. But pro CSGO players are positive they can feel an improvement when running at fps more than double their monitor rate. reply kmeisthax 15 hours agorootparentAlso keep in mind that games don&#x27;t run at a constant FPS. The \"FPS\" stat that we talk about is an average of the time each frame took to process and render, 1&#x2F;x. But we can also talk about deviation from that average, which is where you get \"1% low\" and \"0.1% low\" stats. If your 1%s or 0.1%s dip below your monitor refresh rate, that becomes microstutter, which is way more noticeable than a reduction in the average frame time.Wanting to have FPS at 2x your monitor&#x27;s refresh rate will[0] provide a significant safety margin against frames that take too long to render. I will also point out that this 2x rule came into the community before we had adaptive sync, so the alternative would be turning off vsync in the vain hope that microstutter would get lost in the tearing.For the record, \"microstutter\" wasn&#x27;t really a common thing people talked about until fairly recently, so I&#x27;m kind of applying today&#x27;s more scientific analysis of game performance to things that back then were largely superstitions that happened to work.[0] Assuming a fast CPU and GPU drivers worth using reply squeaky-clean 7 hours agorootparentVery true, I didn&#x27;t want to go too deep in one comment, but I tried to mention that the video of the modded Wipeout is fluctuating between 4000fps and 6000fps, but that doesn&#x27;t cover the fact that 5999 frames may have been calculated in 0.1s and 1 frame took 0.9sI actually tried increasing the input handling resolution of a game of mine by running the input polling and physics system 4x for each actual rendered frame. I thought it would be a great idea, you can get more precise input and physics without also calculating batching, draw calls, or sending anything to the GPU.Only problem was that because the actual game logic and physics in my game was so simple, the visual frame would take about 5ms to calculate&#x2F;render, and then the 4 non-visual frames would take about 0.2ms each to calculate. So even with a 1000hz mouse it was running the non-visual series of frames faster than the mouse would update, and then stalling for 5ms while the visual frame rendered. reply syntheweave 5 hours agorootparentWhen trying to run one system at a higher rate than the other(whether it&#x27;s render, physics, input) the principles of DSP come into play: you&#x27;re running a bunch of things that can be coordinated together for maximum smoothness if you define the sample rates to be consistent and interpolate the sampled data appropriately. If you can run something very fast but you don&#x27;t define a set pace, you don&#x27;t have a theoretically sound starting point, and that&#x27;s where a lot of game timing systems(from basically every era of gaming) fall over and accidentally drop information or add timing artifacts.So, like you, I made a system with a target physics refresh that was above render, but I did it with the goal of visually smooth operation - and therefore, I derived a frame pace from time-from-bootup, and guided the physics refresh not around the direct multiple of vsync, but \"how many frames do I need to issue to keep pace with real time as defined by the system clock\". Doing this naively creates disturbing rubberbanding effects, since the pace naturally oscillates, but adding a low-pass filter to reduce jitter and a \"dropped frames\" adjustment produced motion with a very satisfying quality.I&#x27;m forgetting precisely what I did with the input, on the other hand, but I think I determined that \"as fast as possible\" was still an improvement because the way I was issuing frames was reducing the amount of aliasing of deadlines on the margin.It&#x27;s an area where you can definitely get pretty sophisticated. Many emulators for older systems now are emulating ahead, displaying that result, and then rolling back emulation state to create a configurable negative input latency. reply squeaky-clean 4 hours agorootparentFunny you mention DSP, that&#x27;s a hobby of mine (for music) and I&#x27;ve never really connected DSP fundamentals and FPS outside of animation keyframes.Your system sounds a lot like the current industry standard for deterministic physics engines if the input was processed without regards to the physics or rendering speed (you just need to run the physics at a fixed tickrate and it&#x27;s deterministic). Did you wait for the real time that physics should be occurring at? Most of those don&#x27;t actually run the physics ticks in realtime, basically if you&#x27;re not rendering them you can process a bunch of them in a row and just simulate the clock stepping forward. For physics decoupling I normally just use Unity&#x27;s built in interpolation system which does it that way, but I was trying to get fancy here. The issue in my case is because it depends on external input the physics processing would need to occur at specific real times. And unless I can know the time of the next frame in advance, that&#x27;s difficult and not entirely possible (I didn&#x27;t want to enforce vsync). It would have been fun to go down that rabbithole but at that point I decided to take the easy path and tie input polling to the render rate.And then like 6 months later Unity released the new Input system which can be completely decoupled from any kind of framerate and just gives you realtime input timing values if you want. reply spookie 11 hours agorootparentprevVery much true, just wanted to add something. In the before times, games would be running on pure forward renderers. Which, in turn, would mitigate many of the the frame timing inconsistencies of the more complex pipelines of today! Some still do that, of course. With the exception that we aren&#x27;t relying in fixed function hw anymore! reply ufjfjjfjfj 14 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t it a waste of computing power to produce 6000 fps and only use a fraction of them reply ComputerGuru 13 hours agorootparentYes, but in practice, no. These games are usually coded as a loop that runs with full CPU as fast as it can (unless capped, which the old one wasn’t), using as much cpu as is available. In that case, the fps is a side effect of how long the loop takes to run each pass (which is what happened here) - i.e. you don’t determine the fps, the fps is a result of how complicated or (in)efficient your code is. So going from running at 30 fps because it was so poorly coded and made such inefficient use of the cpu to running at 6000 fps because it now completes each loop pass that much faster, the cpu usage is actually the same.Now if your code is so optimized that it can run at 6000 fps, at that point you can say “gee, I don’t need this many updates a second, let me cap it to x frames per second.” But how do you do that? The GPU is grabbing finished frames out of the buffer at its own pace, whether you are generating them at 6k&#x2F;sec or just 5&#x2F;sec. To cap your cpu consumption you would usually say “we need a new frame every 0.015s to always have a new frame ready for the GPU so that the screen updates sixty times a second, so if we finish a frame in 0.001s instead, sleep (effectively yielding cpu consumption to other processes) for 0.01 seconds after we run through the loop” - but while that may work for some things, there are other stuff that need to happen “in real-time” such as reloading the audio buffer (to avoid pauses or corrupted&#x2F;garbled audio), etc and you also can’t rely on the system to actually wake you before 0.015s even though you asked it to wake you after just 0.01s to be extra safe.Tl;dr, yes, once your code is running at 6k fps, then capping it to reduce consumption is an option, but running at 6k fps doesn’t actually increase cpu vs inefficiently running at 30fps. reply johncoatesdev 12 hours agorootparentYou can get a callback when a frame is going to get drawn and only render then. That way you don&#x27;t render needless frames.Your logic loop that controls the game state can be set to an optimal tick rate so it&#x27;s not just maxing out a core.The audio buffers I&#x27;ve worked with have also supported callbacks so they can remain optimally filled. reply veave 11 hours agorootparentprevThat is so absolutely false. Any game you run if you don&#x27;t cap fps it uses 100% of your gpu and potentially your cpu. As soon as you cap the framerate to 60 fps it starts behaving normally. reply ComputerGuru 8 hours agorootparentI said as much, though. Read again. I had a caveat about when you start limiting your frame rate. reply naikrovek 9 hours agorootparentprev\"rendered\" and \"sent to the screen\" are very different.there are nuances about all of this which make both of you correct in different situations. reply leptons 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s possible that going far above \"6000fps\" might be necessary someday for holographic&#x2F;3D displays that need to render the scene from hundreds or thousands of different viewpoints for one single frame.Say you need to render a scene from 1000 different angles for a 3D display, just to get to a 60hz refresh rate you would need to render the scene 60,000 times. reply somat 7 hours agorootparentprevI think this was just a case of optimized code runs really fast, but sometimes the game will decouple the physics simulation from the graphics, I have seen this done in both directions, racing games where you want the physics to run faster than the graphics for a nice smooth car control, and building games where you want the physics to run slower than the graphics, mainly because you have so much physics you can not calculate it all every frame. reply squeaky-clean 7 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not intended to run at 6000fps. That&#x27;s just how quickly it will run without any form of limiter. You can use your GPU settings to limit the framerate, or many games have a built in frame-limiter. reply throwaway14356 14 hours agorootparentprevyou need about the same impossible accuracy to play this. im only half joking, if you want to improve you will need to somehow respond more accurately. Seeing someone play it well is mind blowing if you know how hard it gets. reply lunchdetail 16 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re talking about the speed of the internal engine, not the display. So the display could still only be showing 60 frames to the user each second (or 120, or anything) but the internal engine is running at 6000fps.Plenty (maybe nearly all?) of games do this because modern engines decouple the engine speed from the display speed. In older systems where you knew the engine was only going to run for a specific game on specific hardware (e.g. a SNES or GameCube or PlayStation), and you knew you were always going to be targeting 30fps, no more no less, you could pretty safely assume the game would _always_ run at 30fps and could use a \"frame\" as a unit of time. So if you want some in-game action like a melee attack to take 1 second, you could just count 30 frames and you would know it was 1 second long. But if somehow this game was later run at 60fps, that same attack would now only take .5 seconds, since there were twice as many frames in a second now.So if you took a game like this meant for 30fps and ran it at 60, everything would just run twice as fast. You wouldn&#x27;t actually be able to play the original game at anything higher than the original frame rate.What they&#x27;re saying here is that they decoupled the two, where originally they were coupled. So now the game can run at high fps and feel smoother than the original lower fps rate, but the gameplay is still at the original intended speed. reply bityard 15 hours agorootparentInteresting twist: Wipeout XL&#x2F;2097 for PC was a terrifically bad port, and the game speed was proportional to how fast your video card could draw the 3D scene, just as you describe.There was a patch at some point to fix this, but honestly just easier to load the game up in a PSX emulator these days. reply mmastrac 16 hours agorootparentprevThe code was probably hyper-optimized for decade+ old hardware. reply db48x 16 hours agorootparentNo, it wasn’t hyper–optimized, it just doesn’t draw many triangles or use many light sources. There is simply a lot less for the renderer to do than in a modern game. reply efields 17 hours agoprev> The 5000 lines of if else that handles the menu state is a striking witness to this insanity.> He takes the code from 40,699 lines to 7,731 and notably loved an excuse to work in C. “I had an absolute blast cleaning up this mess!”I&#x27;t just marvelous to learn what kind of crap coding makes it to production. It&#x27;s a huge boost to my self-esteem. reply rgoulter 17 hours agoparentThe risk of &#x27;bad&#x27; code is that it might be hard to make the change you want. I would believe that spaghetti code is more likely to have bugs than &#x27;well designed&#x27; code.When code is fresh in your mind, there&#x27;s more tolerance for how disorganised the code can be and still be easy to change.If your shipping method is \"one shot\".. time spent cleaning it has a chance to provide value; but time spent adding features is very likely adds value. -- Probably if the code is very clean, then at least some time would have been better spent adding features. reply taeric 17 hours agorootparentYou aren&#x27;t wrong, but a lot of the risk of \"good code\" nowadays is that there is more of it. An added risk is a lot of \"good code\" is leaning heavily on practices that are not good for performance.I don&#x27;t want to push for lax testing standards. And I generally prefer modern build practices for programming. It is hard to take a lot of criticism of gaming code seriously, though, as games were shipped at what feels like a higher success throughput than most business software. reply Pannoniae 14 hours agorootparent\"Bad\" code also has way less abstractions. It&#x27;s ridiculously easy to change something (unless it&#x27;s really spaghetti&#x2F;everything is intertwined)\"Good\" and modern code often has many abstractions. In some cases, that gives ultimate flexibility, but in some cases, if you are fighting the abstraction or the framework, it will make it almost impossible to change. reply ldjkfkdsjnv 13 hours agorootparentI was going to post this, abstractions almost never work out well as the code base changes reply gopher_space 14 hours agorootparentprevThe IRS isn’t going to get involved if your physics don’t match reality. Defining and creating your own data means you get to skip most of the headaches in business software development. reply taeric 11 hours agorootparentNot a small point, but I think it is more than IRS concerns that have caused web bloat. Gmail taking seconds to respond to keyboard is definitely not explained away with business logic being hard. Is it? reply fidotron 16 hours agoparentprevIn games it happens quite a bit.The great debate is always \"will I want to change this tiny thing here without impacting everything else?\" vs DRY. Studio cultures differ, but I would say at least half resort to hard coding things like positions of every item manually given the excuse they might want to shift something by a bit later (in a hurry, crunching etc.) without side effects.Thankfully the emergence of more standard tooling and engines has pushed this to being more of an art resource concern, but it does lead to things like being told that taking a game that assumes a 16:9 1080P display and making it more flexible will take multiple years of person time.Personally I cannot stand this tendency, but do get why they do it. reply hinkley 16 hours agorootparentYou can get pretty close to the end of a project before you really understand what it was you were trying to do.

You scream at the original programmer (who was probably yourself) for being an utter idiot and doing it badly. Then you rewrite it better.Then you go to the next function, and realize it doesn&#x27;t even need the previous function at all, so you get mad at yourself and delete all that wonderful code you just wrote.Then you try a new way: instead of inside out (start at the internal functions) you start at the top - you find where the code handles some particular task, and you drill down deep into it, throwing away useless code left and right and rewrite the thing better. (Your advantage being you know exactly what it needs to do, unlike your previous self who did not know that since he was still developing it.)You also use a tool that finds dead code - in particular functions that are never called by anything. reply bityard 16 hours agorootparentBreaking big problems down into small ones is part of the process, yes, but only once you are well-versed in the problem space. The guy who rewrote this:1. Is proficient in C.2. Understands Playstation architecture and development better than the original programmers of the game. (Although Psygnosis had far less time and hindsight on their side.)3. Is apparently quite familiar with 3D game programming and techniques in general, and how&#x2F;when to use them.4. Already had experience reverse-engineering parts of the game previously.5. Had the free time to undertake a project of this scale.So it&#x27;s not something any random dev can just snap their fingers and decide to do. It&#x27;s a case study on the intersection of experience, preparation, and luck. reply morelisp 14 hours agorootparentOn the other hand I think ars&#x27;s point is good advice: The way you do the work is, by doing the work.So many people I work with these days are constantly looking for tricks, or secrets, magic tools, or whatever they seem to think I&#x27;m doing to consistently outpace them, just to avoid writing code (&#x2F; reading code &#x2F; thinking through code). They take 2-10x longer and their result is invariably worse. When you ask why they do it, they answer \"you&#x27;d have to do so much refactoring\", \"the algorithm would be hard to implement\", \"I&#x27;d have to replace dependency X\", and so on as a list of things that actually aren&#x27;t so hard or time-consuming if you sit down and just do the work. But my only \"trick\" is that I write the code.Just sit down and do it! I&#x27;m reminded of Harlan Ellison, commenting on why he wrote in public,I do it because I think particularly in this country people are so distanced from literature, the way it’s taught in schools, that they think that people who write are magicians on a mountaintop somewhere. And I think that’s one of the reasons why there’s so much illiteracy in this country. So by doing it in public, I show people it’s a job.Wipeout was asses in chairs writing code. This cleanup is an ass in a chair writing code. Yes soft skills are important blah blah.

The author got some important packages to use those.The author could just inline is-odd, it&#x27;s a single line after all, but then he would lose the bragging rights of having a package with 500k weekly downloads.This is how left-pad got included into create-react-app (or something like that) in the past. It was a 3rd or 4th level dependency of something that was actually useful.The problem here is people and packages not really vetting their 3rd-4th level dependencies.

Basically it keeps everything that&#x27;s open-source in Darwin (save for XNU), and re-implements what that&#x27;s proprietary with tailor made free software, on top of a FreeBSD kernel.Since many layers, frameworks and APIs from macOS are reused (even for the GUI which is written in Objective-C and uses the actual Cocoa APIs), the goal is to achieve compatibility with both macOS and FreeBSD apps. And yes, it natively runs Mach-O binaries in the kernel, no emulation layer.\"ravynOS is explicitly trying to be compatible with Mac software at a source and eventually a binary level, without losing support for FreeBSD&#x2F;X11 software, and to implement a very similar experience on the desktop and at the command line. For example, on ravynOS you can type open -a MyApp image.jpg and have image.jpg open in MyApp. You will find things in (mostly) the same directories as a Mac, like ~&#x2F;Library or &#x2F;System&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Fonts.\"Most other projects are just vanilla FreeBSD or Linux with a macOS theme. reply swozey 14 hours agoprevAbout 20 years ago I was an openbsd and freebsd admin, webhosting mostly.

It fills me with a sense of control and tranquility that just isn&#x27;t there in more complex setups. reply swozey 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a great point. Would you consider yourself a minimalist in general? I think I&#x27;m the opposite. I&#x27;m one of those people who installs every (secure and vetted) plugin&#x2F;extension&#x2F;app that makes my life&#x2F;work \"easier.\" I have a ridiculous amount of vscode&#x2F;intellij&#x2F;obsidian plugins that I use. I&#x27;m sure if I used emacs&#x2F;vim it&#x27;d be the same.Just as an example that&#x27;s super frowned upon, I install about 5-10 various packages like jq, htop, net-utils, bash, httpie, things like that into each oci container I build. I also have the exact same customized ~&#x2F;.bashrc with aliases and a motd that tells me the distro and outdated packages and what not in all of the oci containers I build. Also a custom ~&#x2F;.nanorc with syntax highlighting so I don&#x27;t have to constantly write nano -l (everyone will hate me for using nano, I know).I have to troubleshoot containers a lot. This example I&#x27;m posting here went from a 150Mb container to 203 with my \"debug\" packages. And each time I exec into one I get a nice little motd that makes fixing things so much faster for me. A 203Mb container has absolutely no effect on my autoscaling infrastructure. We watch for anomalies and immediately scale up and have the oci images cached on the clusters. I used to make these little 30mb scratch go containers that had literally nothing but the app. It was so annoying having to troubleshoot them and the benefit seemed so not worth it. Not having bash installed is absolutely horrendous. Being forced to use sh. I can&#x27;t use arrow keys to move the cursor or up and down to go through history. I think ctrl-r doesnt even work.I would get absolutely screamed at by the greybeard genius nix admins I used to work with. But I make the infra standards now..

I like it because it is comfortable in a way I don&#x27;t find in linux or windows. I think this is because I understand it. A situation I never feel on windows. you are sitting on so much complexity, it is fine when you are in the happy path where things are working, But I start to get nervous when pondering not only how much I don&#x27;t know about windows but on how much I can not know. Linux is much better, but still has too many moving parts.I don&#x27;t think of openbsd as a minimal system, in fact it is almost the opposite openbsd crams more into it&#x27;s base distribution than most linux distos. But the openbsd services tend to be small and well behaved and well documented., I am a bit biased but I tend to think of openbsd as the best bsd for desktop use. It is not the fastest, it does not have the best filesystems, but damn if everything does not come together in a really comfortable package. reply mekster 5 hours agoparentprevThe fact BSD can&#x27;t run Docker with its vast ecosystem is already a show stopper.Also having little glitches by tiny differences in shell handling make your already tuned Linux dotfiles incompatible that adds to the annoyances.And then I don&#x27;t really get anything over Linux. pf is good but I&#x27;m just mostly using ufw and not running a router in the cloud that requires more than port handling.Ubuntu supports zfs in a very seamless way that I just don&#x27;t find a reason to use BSD anymore unfortunately.

I am not sure why I would use FreeBSD although I recall the community being very helpful. reply _jal 13 hours agoparentprevI run FreeBSD for my home storage server, have for almost a decade now. I&#x27;ve also used it for various other things here and there, but that&#x27;s my major personal use.The best thing about it is that it is boring, completely predictable outside of hardware faults, and dependable. If you know how to competently manage it, which isn&#x27;t hard, it is a rock.Also nice is that FreeBSD isn&#x27;t involved in vendor tugs-of-war that result in the constant stream of bullshit changes* - the network config format doesn&#x27;t change every version, people aren&#x27;t playing political games with init, etc. All of which mean far fewer goofy make-work surprises.And the quality of their releases is still very high. I consider them one of top open source projects, period, in terms of qualities others should emulate for better results.As with anything, it isn&#x27;t for everything. If you need the latest version of whatever is trendy this month, you should run Linux.

That was about, if not over 10 years ago. I also don&#x27;t think it matters. Change is not a bad thing, and that change is not as hectic or constant as you seem to imply.If you really want a Linux distro that hasn&#x27;t changed at all in the past 30 years, Slackware might be your bets bet, but I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;having not changed in the past 30 years&#x27; really makes sense as a metric.Personally, I&#x27;m a fan of Alpine and Void Linux, and I also run NetBSD.

I find the icons available for *nix far superior and interesting. The problem is finding out the good stuff, because its hard with the current signal vs noise ratio. I actually dislike the current macOS icon sets, far too colorful and saturated. reply dlivingston 14 hours agorootparentWhich icon sets do you find superior, in particular?Note that parent meant the UI holistically, and not just icon sets.AFAIK, this way of thinking about the design of the entire system, and not just in discrete segments is largely unique to macOS. I think it is because Apple has a design language they try to enforce as rigorously as possible, even onto 3rd party developers, which gives the OS & all applications on it a very uniform and consistent feeling.Windows is the worst. Microsoft has a design language, but they barely encourage it even among their own apps (Settings vs. Control Panel as one example).I will make a strong claim: I don&#x27;t think any O.S. developer takes design truly seriously besides Apple. Definitely not Microsoft, partially Google with Android, and certainly not most *nix distros (with the possible rare exception like System76&#x27;s Pop!_OS). reply dijit 14 hours agorootparentMost linux desktop environments (notable exception of Gnome3 though it applies for Gnome2) seem to favour old school UX design which, incidentally, I happen to find nicer than “pretty”.I personally really like the Adwaita icon sets much more than windows and at least on-par with MacOS, though MacOS has the advantage of being rendered only on extremely high DPI screens. So most people only have that experienfe reply jwells89 13 hours agorootparentFor whatever it&#x27;s worth, macOS&#x2F;OS X has had very high resolution icons well before high DPI displays were commonly available. Even 10.0 which was released in 2001 supported 128x128 icons, which was 4x larger than what other popular desktops were capable of at the time and enabled far greater levels of detail, even if most users wouldn&#x27;t be seeing that detail most of the time. reply dijit 2 hours agorootparentThats actually true with Adwaita also. :D replyrpastuszak 16 hours agoparentprevHeh my dream was a real-time generative overlay on top of Dwarf Fortress ASCII art.(That was before the Steam version ofc.) reply michaelbrave 15 hours agoparentprevHonestly probably not that hard, could train a model&#x2F;lora with about 30 images, so gather more than 30 good looking icons, train a model and then take the time to prompt and generate all the icons you need.

Aside from GNOME (which is iPadOS, not macOS) and its prettier cousin Pantheon, It&#x27;s just Win9X clones and tiling WMs as far as the eye can see.That might not seem like a big deal, but if the goal is to get as many people switched away from commercial operating systems as possible there needs to be a healthy range of conventions&#x2F;workflows represented by meaningfully different DEs so more users find one they can slip on like a comfy pair of shoes.

NeXT also implemented app directories, where all the contents of an app, its resources and libraries and so on, are in a folder with a special magic name... another idea nicked from Acorn.(Risc OS apps are called !Name; NeXTstep ones are called Name.app.)Acorn Risc OS was also the first OS to have integrated, always-on font antialiasing, next seen in NeXTstep, and the first to have full-window drag.Source: a retrospective meetup of the surviving developers, which I moderated.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=P_SDL0IwbCc&t=2s reply superq 16 hours agorootparentsomewhat related to the directories:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macdisk.com&#x2F;macforken.php reply lproven 4 minutes agorootparentNot really... that&#x27;s a Classic MacOS thing, not anything in NeXTstep, OpenStep or OS X, although OS X respects and preserves them.Perhaps the closer correspondence is file metadata. For all that Risc OS is based on Acorn MOS, an OS that&#x27;s as old or older than MS-DOS, it stores richer metadata: for instance, files have a Creator Type which is 3 hex digits.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_RISC_OS_filetypesThis can&#x27;t be stored on DOS filesystems. So, just like Classic MacOS files with their 2 forks, to keep Risc OS files on DOS media without damaging them, they must be packed inside a Zip file or something like that -- and using a RiscOS (or MacOS) native Zip program that stores, and recreates, the metadata.(Linux used to do something vaguely similar with the `umsdos` filesystem.)DOS&#x2F;Windows PC owners, who think the universe revolves around them, never could get the hang of this. reply spookie 12 hours agorootparentprevOh, interesting! reply azinman2 17 hours agoparentprevIt’s a pretty clear rip of macOS, from the aqua-inspired UI, finder at base, to the layout of the directories. reply danjoredd 14 hours agorootparentI mean, the directories are laid out in the same way because MacOS runs on top of BSD.

For the last 15 years professionally.Four \"recognized\" members of BSD family are FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and DragonflyBSD. Each of them pursue different goals - FreeBSD stability, OpenBSD security, NetBSD portability, DragonflyBSD no idea, never tried it. All of them have similar (make) but different way of building (poudriere &#x2F; dpb) and managing (pkg &#x2F; pkg_) packages, similar (rc) but different way of managing system services (rc.d&#x2F; &#x2F; rc.conf.local), similar (ifconfig) but different (rc.conf&#x27;s ifconfig_if &#x2F; hostname.if) way of setting network interfaces, similar but different ways of containerization and virtualization (jails, chroot, vmm, bhyve) etc.I have reasons why I would choose FreeBSD over OpenBSD for storage server (ZFS), or vice versa for router &#x2F; firewall (rdomains, pf, bgpd, ospfd, iked &#x2F; ipsec etc.)I don&#x27;t have a slightest idea why would I choose HelloSystem or HardenedBSD for my laptop instead of FreeBSD. reply rollcat 14 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t have a slightest idea why would I choose HelloSystem or HardenedBSD for my laptop instead of FreeBSD.I haven&#x27;t actually tried HelloSystem on real hardware as a daily driver, but I can clearly see why people would find it valuable (at least according to their stated goals).The reasons are the same as why you&#x27;d choose Ubuntu over Slackware: the base install is intended as a fully functional desktop OS. Focus on the OOB experience, vertical integration, accessibility, polish, simplicity, etc. Even if you&#x27;re a power user, there is still value to having all of these things: your energy is probably better spent on something more useful than figuring why basic, random stuff isn&#x27;t working. (Assuming HelloSystem delivers on their stated goals!)It is true that these are all \"merely\" downstream projects, but I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss them on these grounds alone.

I&#x27;ve been down that road with a ThinkPad T410 and all 3 of the major ones. OpenBSD wouldn&#x27;t support my network card, FreeBSD was easiest but I remember X11 would lag, resorting in having to turn off some hardware accel stuff (thanks to their helpful forum), NetBSD experience was brief but I simply felt like I was in no mans land, maybe i was wrong...Mouse gestures wouldn&#x27;t work, I think some media buttons, all these annoying little things I had to hunt down and tweak myself. Mind you again, this was on a damn Thinkpad, what better laptop to run FreeBSD!That&#x27;s probably the use case for what HelloSystem is for, a BSD you don&#x27;t have to muck around with on a laptop. But I knew damn well when I was 20 I wasn&#x27;t going to swallow my pride and install some kiddieBSD, at that rate I&#x27;d say why BSD at all and go back to Ubuntu where everything is safe. I did and have no regrets lol.I don&#x27;t remember where, but someone once said FreeBSD is best for computers that you don&#x27;t have to look at.

By Thomas Germain PublishedYesterday Comments (13) Photo: zimmytws / Shutterstock.com (Shutterstock) Many students have no choice about working with the College Board, the company that administers the SAT test and Advanced Placement exams. Part of that relationship involves a long history of privacy issues. Tests by Gizmodo found if you use some of the handy tools promoted by College Board’s website, the organization sends details about your SAT scores, GPA, and other data to Facebook, TikTok, and a variety of companies. Gizmodo observed the College Board’s website sharing data with Facebook and TikTok when a user fills in information about their GPA and SAT scores. When this reporter used the College Board’s search filtering tools to find colleges that might accept a student with a C+ grade-point average and a SAT score of 420 out of 1600, the site let the social media companies know. Whether a student is acing their tests or struggling, Facebook and TikTok get the details. The College Board shares this data via “pixels,” invisible tracking technology used to facilitate targeted advertising on platforms such as Facebook and TikTok. The data is shared along with unique user IDs to identify the students, along with other information about how you use the College Board’s site. Organizations use pixels and other tools to share data so they can send targeted ads to people who use their apps and websites on other platforms, such as Google, Facebook, and TikTok. “We do not share SAT scores or GPAs with Facebook or TikTok, and any other third parties using pixel or cookies,” said a College Board spokesperson. “In fact, we do not send any personally identifiable information (PII) through our pixels on the site. In addition, we do not use SAT scores or GPAs for any targeting.” After receiving this comment, Gizmodo shared a screenshot of the College Board sending GPAs and SAT scores to TikTok using a pixel. The spokesperson then acknowledged that the College Board’s website actually does share this data. “Pixels are simply a means to measure the effectiveness of College Board advertising,” the spokesperson said. “If a student uses the college search tool on CB.org, the student can add a GPA and SAT score range to the search filters. Those values are passed in the pixel, not because we configured the pixel that way but because that’s how the pixel works.” The spokesperson stressed that no personally identifiable information is shared using pixels or cookies. Our tests didn’t show the College Board sharing information like names or phones numbers, which fall in the category of personal info. However, pixels and cookies typically contain unique stings of letters and numbers meant to identify and track users. For years, experts have argued and demonstrated this poses privacy risks and is far from anonymous. This kind of data sharing is common on the internet. For example, Gizmodo found 28,000 apps sending TikTok data in March, a number that likely under-counts the company’s actual data harvesting empire. In December, 2022, an investigation found Amazon, FBI.gov, and 70,000 other websites sending user data to Twitter, the company now known as X. However, many privacy advocates have argued the College Board and companies which handle data about students and minors should be held to a higher standard—especially when many of these services are all but mandatory in the American education system. The College Board has a long and troubled history when it comes to student privacy. In 2018 and 2019, the organization was caught selling data about students, including the names of SAT test takers, for as little as 47 cents a piece. An investigation in 2020 by this reporter found similar data sharing practices, in which the College Board told Google, Facebook, and numerous other companies about nearly everything you did on the company’s website. At the time, this violated explicit commitments the College Board made to users, including the “Student Privacy Pledge,” a voluntary commitment between education technology companies. By signing the pledge, the College Board promised not to “use or disclose student information collected through an educational/school service (whether personal information or otherwise) for behavioral targeting of advertisements to students.” Since then, the College Board appears to have scrubbed references to the Student Privacy Pledge from its website and is no longer listed as a signatory. The College Board Spokesperson said the company uses student data, with permission, to help students access and succeed in college. “Transparency is among our key data privacy principles,” the spokesperson said, providing a link to the company’s privacy policy. If you want to attain higher education in the United States, the College Board is hard to avoid. The organization writes and administers the SAT test and Advance Placement (AP) exams, which students take to earn college credit and bolster applications. The College Board also runs standardized tests taken by children as young as kindergartners, and essentially writes the curriculum in some school districts. The College Board, as powerful as a governmental institution in some regards, is a non-profit. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t profitable for the people who run it. According to tax forms, 14 of the College Board’s 17 executives made more than $300,000 in 2021. Together, CEO David Coleman and President Jeremy Singer made $1,782,254. TikTok’s ad library shows that the College Board ran a number of ads on the platform in fall of 2022, but TikTok doesn’t disclose whether or not these ads were targeted at students using data collected from pixels.

The college crows that they&#x27;re don&#x27;t provide PII, but the whole point of tracking pixels is that those services already know precisely who you are.

For a large sum of money, you can scrape the most comprehensive database on people in the western world. It will give the buyer information on what you look like, when you were born (and whether or not you&#x27;re dead), what banks you have accounts with, how many cars you own, where you live, what property you own, who you&#x27;re married to, who your children are (where they live, if they&#x27;re old enough and you run clears on them), social media accounts, and other info.But it&#x27;s not the US government and Five Eyes spying on you - it&#x27;s a private corporation... What no one mentions is that these countries have very lucrative contracts with Reuters to maintain this database for their use.The police also use it to find information on you if they feel they need to really get into your business. And companies use it to check that you&#x27;re the \"right fit\" before hiring you. Banks use it before giving out loans to make sure you are who you say you are... I&#x27;ve even heard stories of some landlords using it to make sure their tenants are the \"right kind of person\".If you want more info on tools like these, and how to thwart them, look up \"The Privacy, Security, & OSINT Show\" by Michael Bazzell. reply aio2 21 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s interesting was that back in 2019, they gave access to students&#x27; data for 47¢ per name.

They&#x27;re ostensibly a nonprofit that has a captive audience in the form of basically every US high school student who&#x27;s even considering college.The fact that they&#x27;re advertising anything at all is just as concerning to me as the data they use to target those ads. reply hgsgm 20 hours agoparentEveryone advertises.

The spokesperson assumed they were being accused of abusing their position of running the SAT by actually sending real SAT scores directly to Facebook, so they responded accordingly.Instead they were abusing their position of trust to get students to enter the scores again themselves and sending that. Still not great, but not a lie on the spokesperson&#x27;s part, just a misunderstanding of what was meant. reply peyton 20 hours agorootparentThey lied. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentNo, they didn&#x27;t, they responded to the question they thought they were being asked. The form fields on their college search page weren&#x27;t even in their working memory at the time.This is a case of the College Board negligently failing to recognize these fields as sensitive data, not a case of them outright lying.

There is far too much security \"surface area\" for a workable technical solution without re-engineering the entire ecosystem.That legislation is of course unlikely because political parties, think tanks, governments, and propagandists all want to gather as much information as possible for their own purposes.Literally every single financial, political, and social incentive points toward maximization of surveillance everywhere. I feel like it&#x27;s pretty hopeless without something very bad happening and causing a huge grassroots movement that can&#x27;t easily be ignored. reply hgsgm 20 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s accurate but deceptive. CB does not send PII. Your SAT scores or estimates thereof are your private data, but not Personally IdentifyingFacebook and TikTok already have the PII!

Companies use third party data to correlate outside activity to Google.The government has used it to deter radicalization and to redirect people with opioid issues. You can compare online behaviors with say health insurance claims and lifestyle factors and score likelihood of events. Once that correlation is done, you can target ads to influence behavior. reply soulofmischief 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m still enraged even after framing this as \"it&#x27;s just search parameters, all search parameters are tracked\".

HN does not send your HN handle information to any third party. That said, your posts and comments include certain metadata, including your HN handle and a link to account metadata as per the privacy policy. This data is public and may be accessed by third parties. reply chaps 20 hours agorootparentHow is this even remotely the same thing? For one, HN doesn&#x27;t use pixels to communicate directly with tiktok, Facebook, etc. And what does publicly accessible data have to do with this? reply nerdponx 20 hours agorootparentprev1. Search queries are not metadata.2. Why is sharing metadata with unknown arbitrary 3rd parties OK? Not all metadata is or should be public. reply Spooky23 13 hours agorootparentMy point, poorly made, is that the statements made by companies sharing this data don’t mean what they appear to at first reading.Even in the silly HN example, you can analyze referrer data and build profiles of people, without any cooperation on HNs part. reply asu_thomas 21 hours agoparentprev> It would be comical if it weren&#x27;t so dystopianDystopian?

    "originBody": "About Blog Customers Pricing Enterprise Changelog Docs Sign in Get Started August 25th, 2023 Email Authentication: A Developer's Guide Learn the importance of SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and BIMI in ensuring email delivery. Jonni Lundy Proper email authentication can be the difference between reaching the human or the spam folder, but it is often overlooked or misunderstood. Think of your emails as a startup getting into a competitive accelerator program. SPF (Receiving Applications) Competitive startup programs will receive 10's of thousands of applications. Their first step is to see which of these applications can be thrown out without being considered. SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is similar. It's the first triage of the emails coming to an inbox, checking to make sure that each email should even be considered for delivery. The DNS record for SPF declares a list of origins (servers) that are allowed to send email for this domain, and the inbox will confirm that the message they received matches one of them. If a server isn't on the list, it's like an application being tossed out because it wasn't fully filled or the business idea is illegal. Every domain or subdomain can only have one SPF policy, and policies on the root/apex domain (domain.com) are not applied to subdomains (sub.domain.com). Your SPF policy, specified in a TXT record, probably looks like this: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:amazonses.com ~all v=spf1: The version of SPF include:_spf.google.com: Allows Google servers to send emails on your domain include:amazonses.com: Allows AWS servers to send emails on your domain ~all: The policy which tells the server what to do if the SPF check fails When a mailbox receives a message from you, it will look at the Return-Path in the email header and expects it to map back to one of the origins specified in the record. DKIM (Application Vetting) If the application passes that initial check, then the vetting process begins to make sure all the claims the applicants made are true. DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) plays a similar role to confirm the legitimacy of the message by adding a signature on each message that verifies the email sender is who they say they are. DKIM is set with a private/public key pairing. You set a public key in your DNS records (usually a CNAME or TXT record) Each email you send includes a DKIM signature When an inbox receives your message, it compares the signature with the public record to confirm a pair Especially as your company becomes more well known, there are more incentives for hackers to send an email as if it is from you. The DKIM, like a strong login password, is an essential way to prove who you are by providing information only you know. It is common to have multiple DKIM records, usually one or more per email provider. DMARC (Selection Policy) What if an applicant fails one of these steps? How should their application be handled? DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) is the selection policy. It sets rules for what happens if an applicant lies on an application (DKIM) vs. not demonstrate enough traction (SPF). For email, DMARC establishes your policy as a sender for what should happen to your messages if they fail DKIM or SPF. You would likely have one DMARC policy set for your entire domain, including subdomains, in a TXT record that looks like this: v=DMARC1;p=quarantine;pct=100;rua=mailto:dmarc@domain.com v: The version of DMARC p: What the mailbox should do (policy) if SPF or DKIM fails (none, quarantine, reject) pct: The percentage of failed messages that should be affected by the policy. rua: A valid inbox where the providers should send their DMARC reports Implementing DMARC, particularly with a policy of quarantine or reject, enhances your domain's reputation. This is because inbox providers can rely on your commitment to prevent the delivery of suspicious messages, thereby improving their user experience within the inbox. Check out our full guide on how to set up DMARC. BIMI (Exclusive Access) Making it into a startup accelerator is an amazing feat, but if you want to be exceptional, you need to gain the attention of the industry leaders and pioneers. There are no hacks or shortcuts to this, you simply need to prove yourself. BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) is this kind of access in the inbox. It sets you apart from all the others by showcasing your brand and legitimacy to your users in the inbox by displaying your logo and, in some cases, a verified checkmark. With over 347 billion emails sent every day, this is an exceptional way to stand out. Obtaining BIMI is exclusive because of the long, hard process it takes to complete the verification. Here are a few things you need: DMARC: The DMARC policy must be at quarantine or reject and at 100% Trademarked Logo: The logo you want to showcase must be trademarked VMC: The certificate which verifies your identity, domain, and trademark v=BIMI1; l=https://vmc.digicert.com/00-00.svg; a=https://vmc.digicert.com/00-00.pem; v: The version of BIMI l: The location of the SVG logo a: The location of the Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) Check out our full guide on how to set up BIMI. Delivery is the Goal The good news is that SPF and DKIM are handled for you when using Resend. All you need to do is add a domain and we take care of the rest. Ultimately, inbox providers aim to only show the emails their users want to see, and spoofed or compromised emails are not on the list. Without these protocols, they can't tell you from a spammer. Assure them you're legit, and they'll prioritize your emails.

It’s for developers because they used a startup accelerator analogy? I didn’t see anything particularly differentiated from the equivalent SendGrid&#x2F;Mailgun&#x2F;etc blogs that come up.This is probably the best demo for understanding SPF&#x2F;DKIM&#x2F;DMARC that I’ve come across (I am not affiliated): https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.learndmarc.com&#x2F;If you really want to understand DMARC check it out. reply jmholla 5 hours agoparentI heavily agree. The analogy was distracting at best, confusing at worst. Just explaining what each feature does is perfectly grokkable. We all know what email is. reply PreInternet01 16 hours agoprevNote that this is about the use case &#x27;authenticating whether the given mail server is authorized to send mail for the given domain&#x27;, not the use cases &#x27;authenticating whether the given user of this mailbox actually sent this email&#x27; or &#x27;authenticating whether the given message is spam or not&#x27;, which is probably the reason you clicked on this article :).The former use case is pretty much solved (in that you can safely ignore email from servers&#x2F;domains that don&#x27;t follow best practices), the latter (combining the 2, since they&#x27;re pretty similar, really) is not, even given recent advances in AI (OpenAI cannot tell you if a message is spam, sorry, unless your prompt engineering skills are much better than mine). reply hashstring 14 hours agoparent> OpenAI cannot tell you if a message is spam, sorry, unless your prompt engineering skills are much better than mine.Sometimes an e-mail message itself does not even contain enough information to accurately classify it as spam or phish. To a degree, spam is subjective. And classifying a phish may not be trivial at all (e.g. message may include legit marketing links, open redirects and server side logic to serve certain pages only to targets, etc.). reply heipei 2 hours agorootparentThank you for that comment, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something many people really understood. The same is true for phishing websites. So much depends on the context and incomplete background information. Is a website that asks you to put in your username and password bad? Well, it depends on what the website does with that information in the background. I&#x27;ve seen very suspicious websites asking for user information which were, in the end, just sites set up by marketing departments of the larger company who were unaware of the dangerous precedent they were setting. reply bruce343434 13 hours agorootparentprevYup, when I order something I get really annoyed that I get an email for every fart that the delivery driver lets out. I&#x27;ll hear the doorbell, I don&#x27;t need 500 anticipatory emails. It&#x27;s not a scam, not a phish, and it&#x27;s 100% factual and \"informative\". But still junk. reply akho 4 hours agorootparentIt isn&#x27;t spam though (being a part of a real commercial relationship, and having a working unsubscribe link), and marking it as such poisons your spam filter. reply thijsvandien 5 hours agoparentprevTo further emphasize the point that a mail server being authorized often isn&#x27;t worth much, or can be counterproductive even: shocking numbers of SMTP providers don&#x27;t verify anything beyond the login. As a result, each and every one who manages to get an account can send legitimate looking messages for whatever domain allowing that host, e.g. another tenant. Microsoft and Google do perform sender address checks, as well as TransIP that I know of. Apart from them, though...For reference: in Postfix this can be configured with smtpd_sender_restrictions. reply Systemmanic 14 hours agoprevI liked the look of this:>BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) is this kind of access in the inbox. It sets you apart from all the others by showcasing your brand and legitimacy to your users in the inbox by displaying your logo and, in some cases, a verified checkmark.Until I looked at the cost of a Verified Mark Certificate (1-year plan):>$1,499.00 USD [1]Yikes.Small money for big players, but small businesses with valid brands not so much.[1]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;order.digicert.com&#x2F;step1&#x2F;vmc_basic reply donmcronald 12 hours agoparent$1500 USD &#x2F; year for something that collides with the logo functionality of Gravatar if the user isn&#x27;t hovering over the logo?We used to emphasize domains and everyone understood them. Then the large tech companies de-emphasized domains to the point where people stopped understanding them. Now big tech is going to sell domain validation back to us at a premium? Wow! What innovation.I know there&#x27;s trademark verification too, but I&#x27;ve never met a normal person that could tell you a difference between a Gravatar logo like the one I see in my mail client and a VMC logo like the one I see in the screenshots, so what good is showing a trademarked logo? Also, most small businesses I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t even have trademarks, so they&#x27;ll be completely excluded from this system.I wonder if this is going to turn out like code signing certificates where they&#x27;re super expensive for small developers, so they get excluded, but they&#x27;re totally attainable for scammers and scumbags, so there&#x27;s plenty of malware and garbage signed by certificates from fly-by-night companies.Does BIMI help you pass spam filters like EV code signing certificates help you bypass SmartScreen? I can&#x27;t be the only one that thinks all these things feel like a scam.One thing I&#x27;m certain of based on what we see with SSL certificates. Government agencies will be racing to light money on fire buying them. Every year I watch my taxes get spent on overpriced DigiCert OV certificates and it enrages me. For all intents and purposes, all certificates are identical to normal users. It doesn&#x27;t matter if DigiCert is taking my DNA for validation, all my mom sees is the lock icon. Nothing else matters. reply technion 8 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m pretty annoyed by BIMI.We only just had Lets Encrypt shutdown the EV nonsense from the CA industry, and BIMI, which is only currently able to be signed by two super expensive providers, is their comeback.Aside from the fact it&#x27;s just unnecessary, I&#x27;m seeing a range of various \"domain security checks\" services now test for BIMI, meaning lack of BIMI is something I&#x27;m already seeing showing up on low rate \"penetration tests\".Note it&#x27;s not even supported on Office 365, meaning all those business customers you&#x27;re aiming for won&#x27;t see it. reply upofadown 14 hours agoprevThis is new:>BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) is this kind of access in the inbox. It sets you apart from all the others by showcasing your brand and legitimacy to your users in the inbox by displaying your logo and, in some cases, a verified checkmark.Apparently this can help me promote my brand. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a brand so I fear that this would be used to promote the brands of others at my expense. reply hashstring 14 hours agoprevAnyone willing to share opinions on BIMI?I’m wondering if it is worth it for most medium-large organization or if this is specifically worth it if you are doing a lot of commerce and sending e-mails to customers etc.Furthermore, (stating the obvious) DKIM, SPF and DMARC are also implemented by malicious parties and only authenticate that the server was allowed to send using a particular domain name. BIMI seems to require a VMC (Verified Mark Certificate). Is this verified and is it effective in preventing unauthorized parties from BIMI verifying their domains using stolen brand logo’s etc.Also, is Microsoft Outlook (still) not supporting&#x2F;adopting BIMI? reply brightball 13 hours agoparentHappy to.BIMI is worthless. It&#x27;s a carrot to get your marketing department on board with setting up DMARC because they are the most likely to push back due to fears of the project affecting their email deliverability. You have to fully deploy DMARC to setup BIMI.Now, BIMI and the costs to \"verify\" your mark is pushed by exactly the same people who tried to sell you extended validation SSL that would turn your browser address bar green when you visited a site that had gone through this verification.Just like with EV SSL, BIMI has no positive impact on user security. They&#x27;re just as likely to open &#x2F; not open an email with BIMI as they are to visit a site with or without EV SSL. In some cases, it&#x27;s actually worse.The only benefit to BIMI is it gives you another place for the marketing department to stick the logo so they&#x27;ll stop fighting the DMARC rollout. That&#x27;s it. Otherwise it&#x27;s total waste of money and time.Wrote about it here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brightball.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;enterprise-challenges-wi... reply layer8 14 hours agoparentprevAs an end user, this is gimmicky to me, and I wouldn’t want to use an email client that causes the respective emails to appear more prominent by showing their BIMI logo. It would be similarly annoying as emojis in the subject line. reply Avamander 13 hours agorootparentA lot of mail clients do display it though. Plus it does help the average user differentiate between rnicrosoft.com and microsoft.com, I&#x27;d guess. reply crote 10 hours agoparentprevBIMI looks to be exactly as broken as EV, in that it assumes that company names and logos are unique - which they are not. It also suffers from the vast majority of legitimate emails not having it.The only people who benefit from BIMI are the ones selling the quite expensive certificates. reply albertgoeswoof 13 hours agoparentprevHere’s what we wrote about BIMI. Some selected excerpts:> To ensure that logos are actually truly representative of the brand involved, and more cynically, to make money and penalize small senders, an optional Verified Mark Certificate can be added to the DNS records, which some mailboxes will validate before showing the logo.> Unfortunately VMC certificates cost upwards of $1000 USD to purchase. Which puts them out of reach for casual or small senders (of which we are big supporters here at MailPace), and undermines the BIMI effort overall.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mailpace.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;what-is-bimi&#x2F; reply starfox64_ 13 hours agoparentprevI think it&#x27;s a good initiative, it&#x27;s obviously there for CAs to make a buck but it&#x27;s finally a way to arguably curb phishing emails that rely on similar domain names or IDN characters all the while making your brand identity more prominent.It seems to also have learned from one of Extended Certificate&#x27;s shortcomings by relying on trademark instead of company name. I actually wish something similar was created to replace EV certificates as it&#x27;s easier than ever to perform phishing attacks now that everyone and their grandmas has a DV certificate on their site (which is a good thing). reply crote 10 hours agorootparentTrademarks still aren&#x27;t 100% unique, though. For example, Apple Records is easily confused with Apple Music - both have a similar name, and both use an apple as logo. It is better, but not foolproof. reply torgard 8 hours agorootparentYes, but Apple Records aren&#x27;t going to be phishing Apple Music customers.Phishers won&#x27;t be applying for trademarks to impersonate Apple. reply pnpnp 5 hours agorootparentWhy not? reply Avamander 1 hour agorootparentExpensive, you&#x27;ll leave a paper trail, get shut down rather quickly. There&#x27;s little to no profit that can be made like that. reply hashstring 6 minutes agorootparentRegistering a domain and hosting a phishing website usually comes at a small price (around 10$) which is just 1% of the VMC (I just learned that).“Expensive” is very subjective, I think it highly depends on the financial standard of the actor and the expected value.In the case of Apple: if it is expected to aid in phishing an interesting iCloud user, or scamming 100 users for 10$, then I expect that there will be actors that will pay this initial cost to make more later on.I agree that the classic mass-mail LQ phish actors would probably not go here, but the same holds for smaller organizations. With the current price-tag, end users then still have to trust non-BIMI and BIMI verified e-mails daily.That seems to leave plenty room for phishing. Also, if VMC prices drop, it will also attract more phish actors.Though I see your point, I do not think that a financial bar is effectively combatting phishing.I do not know how valid the paper trail concern is; I haven’t gone through the VMC procedure(s).chedabob 13 hours agoparentprevWhile there&#x27;s multiple competing standards I&#x27;m ignoring it. At least with MTA-STS and DANE you didn&#x27;t have to fork out $1000+ to support both.There was also this which showed up a month after Google started their rollout of the BIMI checkmark: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;chrisplummer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1664075886545575941 reply Avamander 13 hours agorootparentMTA-STS and DANE are not fulfilling an even remotely similar purpose.Plus nobody significant really follows&#x2F;uses DANE, because how shit DNSSEC is. reply jeroenhd 12 hours agoparentprevBIMI solves various problems DMARC&#x2F;DKIM&#x2F;SPF still leave open. In that sense, I applaud the initiative.The $1000 certificate makes it unusable for anyone but the most annoying marketeers, though. Any EV certificate would&#x27;ve worked to serve the \"business verified by a trusted third party\" requirement, but CAs being CAs, they had to invent a new certificate for business reasons.The process is further complicated by leaving it open to recipient servers whether or not they actually trust you after buying the special certificate. This does make sense for the small number of companies actually using BIMI, but it does hurt the scalability of the solution. reply Avamander 13 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s helpful to raise the priority on fixing DMARC in an organization.It is annoyingly expensive, but I&#x27;m expecting it to change with additional CAs entering the market. Very \"EV\" vibes though, but it is literally for that, so.End users might also appreciate something nicer than autogenerated one-letter icons. Matter of taste.It also makes phish stand out more than usual, if the user has grown accustomed. We&#x27;ll see its efficacy long-term though, too early to say. reply thereald0tt 13 hours agoprevCan someone tell me what is it that resend provides over their wrapper (AWS) that makes them this famous? reply 3dbrows 9 hours agoprevDoes Resend use AWS SES under the hood? reply pembrook 8 hours agoparentFrom what I can tell, yes. reply charamis 14 hours agoprevI’m trying to setup my own domain for my email address since yesterday and this really hit the spot. reply jeroenhd 12 hours agoparentOne additional (non-security) feature that this guide missed is a reverse PTR record for your server&#x27;s IP address. You&#x27;ll have to set this on the side where you get your IP address from rather than in your own DNS, but lacking it will get your email classified as spam even if you implement all the other protocols. Basically, when your mail server says \"EHLO mail.chamaris.tld\", the other side will try to validate that the IP address you&#x27;re connecting from actually points to mail.chamaris.tld.Furthermore, you need to pick a host that takes action when their IP addresses appear on blacklists. Microsoft, particularly, uses UCEPROTECT as a blacklist source, and that particular company will blacklist and entire ASN if they receive too much spam from a particular IP address block (that doesn&#x27;t get resolved in time). reply charamis 10 hours agorootparentGlad you&#x27;re pointing it out. I still have problems, indeed, having my emails flagged as spam when sent to outlook.com. On gmail.com they go straight to the inbox.If I understand correctly though, I should have to set a reverse PTR record in the case of setting up my own mail server, right? And I should configure it on the mailserver&#x27;s side, correct? That&#x27;s not my case though, I&#x27;m just using a custom domain with the MX records pointing to the mail service that I&#x27;m using.I&#x27;ll just wait a few days cause the domain is new and I guess that&#x27;s the reason outlook.com flags it. reply nicolast 2 hours agorootparentprevExactly: a non-blacklisted IP with good reputation, correct mailname and valid PTR record is the foundation, ideally augmented with SPF. I&#x27;ve been running an e-mail service without DKIM and DMARC for many years without any delivery issues, only adding those very recently. reply Avamander 1 hour agorootparentIdeally? No. SPF (or DKIM) is pretty much mandatory for delivering mail. reply Avamander 11 hours agorootparentprev> Microsoft, particularly, uses UCEPROTECT as a blacklist source, and that particular company will blacklist and entire ASN if they receive too much spam from a particular IP address block (that doesn&#x27;t get resolved in time)They absolutely do not use that crap. reply zenorocha 13 hours agoparentprevSo happy to see this was useful! reply stuckinaloop 13 hours agoprevHey Resend team!
