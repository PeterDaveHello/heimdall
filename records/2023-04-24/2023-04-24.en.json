The $1 billion, 1.7 million-square-foot site will house 13 buildings and draw its power from rooftop and ground solar panels, as well as an on-site solar plant when completed in 2025, according to a press release.Using the same factory blueprint as its other Lego factories, the full plant is slated to open in the second half of 2025.Dive Insight:The carbon-neutral facility is part of Lego\u2019s goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 37% by 2032.\u201cWe are working hard to reduce emissions at the Lego Group and are really excited about our plans to build this solar plant as we push towards a better world for our children to inherit,\u201d COO Carsten Rasmussen said in a statement.The site will employ more than 1,700 people in molding, processing and packing machinery once completed. However, Lego is currently recruiting up to 500 people for a temporary packing facility it plans to open in the first half of 2024.The Virginia facility will be Lego\u2019s second plant in North America. In August, Lego invested $500 million to expand its first facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The sites add to Lego\u2019s manufacturing plants in Denmark, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and China. It\u2019s also planning to open its first carbon-neutral site in Vietnam.The Virginia location will bring the toy manufacturer closer to major markets, shorten its supply chain and respond quickly to consumer demands, according to the release.\u201cOur new factory in the U.S. and expanded capacity at our existing site in Mexico means we will be able to best support long-term growth in the Americas,\u201d Rasmussen said in a statement in June. \u201cWe are fortunate to find a location where we can begin construction quickly and create temporary capacity in under two years.\u201dIn January, Lego said it was moving its Americas office from Enfield, Connecticut to Boston, Massachusetts by 2026. The move would support the company\u2019s goals to bring Lego to more kids in the U.S. and the Americas region, Skip Kodak, president of the LEGO Group in the Americas, said in a statement.\u201cBoston is ranked one of the best cities in the world to attract and retain talent.

        "hn_content": "Lego plans to build its first US factory in Virginia, creating around 1,400 jobs. LEGO Group had significant financial hardships 20, 25 years ago before it made many changes in strategy and operations, leading to its current success. The new plant will be carbon neutral via on-site Solar. Lego operates multiple 1B+ factories around the world, and it is the largest manufacturer of tiny little toy car wheels using a few grams of rubber. Lego will invest around $400 million in the new production site, which will be located near Richmond.Lego has opened a new manufacturing facility in the US, which will enable the company to manufacture more Lego products locally, reducing shipping-related carbon output. The new facility, in Ohio, will produce small plastic toy tires, the company reports. A number of readers suggest that Mexican labour issues, alongside cheaper energy and a better-trained and larger manufacturing workforce in the US make the location an attractive production base. However, others argue high US labour costs are compensated for through the brand's pricing, which they suggest is now more geared towards being a luxury product.- LEGO sets are often criticized for being expensive, but basic sets are still available with loose bricks that can be purchased.\n- LEGO Classic line has small sets with themed special parts starting at under 20 GBP/25 USD.\n- The price per piece of LEGO varies greatly by set and category.\n- Prices of LEGO sets have actually remained constant over the last couple of decades.\n- Virginia has a significant amount of solar energy despite not being particularly sunny, and LEGO's new factory in Virginia is 100% carbon neutral via on-site solar energy.\n- LEGO is first and foremost a marketing machine and has historically been successful with its Star Wars franchise.\n- The plastic cost for LEGO is relatively low compared to other plastic products.\n- Every kWh of solar is a kWh of gas not burnt, but this is becoming less true in areas with a lot of solar, such as California.\n- The issue with exporting California's surplus solar energy is complicated and involves grid oversaturation problems.Lego announces plans to build a new $1billion factory in the United States. Concerns are raised by consumers about recent quality problems with Lego products. California Independent System Operator (CISO) has not had a single hour without gas-produced electricity, even in the height of summer with low demand. The comments section includes sarcastic debates about Lego manufacturing and US labor practices, with some expressing concern about the treatment of American employees. Some readers express delight that manufacturing jobs are coming back to the US. Brazil already has multiple 1200-mile HVDC lines in operation.Lego toy bricks have generated much interest, with discussions about salaries and benefits, cleaning up Lego pieces, using Lego as adult toys, and a new solar plant project by the company. The adult market for Lego bricks has expanded significantly. The brand deals with other IPs like Marvel and movie adaptations have helped extend sales to younger age groups. The company has moved away from family-run-inheritance model, and now focuses more on the adult market. Despite the high cost of franchise sets, there's still a loyal following of customers for premium Lego products.Lego has seen a drastic ramp-up in sales in recent years, especially with licensed sets like Friends, Seinfeld, and The Office, and their \"Adults Welcome\" campaign. Lego's quality, design chops, durability, and friction-free experience makes it worth the premium price. Raw material cost is not a good proxy for the end user value of finished goods, as demonstrated by the example of the iPhone. Lego's dominant, established brand, and licensing of expensive creative IPs, also contribute to their success.- Lego is the only toy brand licensed to make popular IP-based products, such as Marvel and DC comics, and Star Wars.\n- Lego has elevated itself to the status of a platform, without being software or hardware.\n- Lego's kits are designed with parts specifically made for the set, extensive documentation, and high-quality manufacturing.\n- Lego's premium pricing is justified by the quality of its manufacturing, tight tolerances, and high-quality tooling.\n- Lego's environmental impact is being addressed, with plans to switch to plastic derived from plant sources within a decade.\n- Lego's unique set designs are capitalizing on pop-culture references but at the expense of encouraging creativity with general building blocks. However, some recently launched Lego sets incorporate creativity with storytelling and extra components to inspire creativity.- A parent has a child who enjoys building blocks and Legos.\n- No new or significant developments in the tech industry are being discussed in this text.\n- The post does not provide any context or relevance to the tech-savvy community.",

        "hn_content": "YouTube algorithm receives praise for curating enjoyable content for users. Some users have found the recommended videos to be too flashy or overproduced in the past but have noticed significant improvements recently. Users credit the algorithm for suggesting high-quality educational content and filtering out clickbait garbage. Some users have shared tips for managing their viewing history and removing unwanted video suggestions. Some have called for the removal of YouTube shorts, a feature causing addiction in some users, and for the option to disable it. Ad-blockers and extensions that remove clickbait thumbnails are recommended.Users on Hacker News discuss the volume of Indian music videos, movie trailers, and clips on YouTube, with some users calling it \"video garbage\" and others noting that the popularity of such content may be due to lower quality recording devices and an incentive to make money. Several users also criticize YouTube's algorithm, saying it lacks a way to explore videos chronologically or broaden users' horizons and tends to filter bubble users, although some note that they appreciate the \"New to You\" and \"recently shown on home page\" features. The discussion also touches on user experience issues with TikTok.1. The YouTube algorithm is both impressive and flawed, causing unnecessary repetition and making content inaccessible.\n2. Some users suggest using the Subscriptions list instead of relying solely on recommendations.\n3. Some users want a button to refresh recommendations or regulate how many times a video is recommended.\n4. YouTube is a vital source of diverse, informational, entertaining content but may face the risk of shutdown in the future.\n5. The YouTube algorithm relies heavily on recently watched videos, causing users to feel overwhelmed with too much content on one topic.\n6. Users worry that YouTube may one day have to lock content behind a login-wall and lose its accessibility.\n7. Some users make a conscious effort to avoid watching certain content to curate their recommendations.\n8. YouTube sometimes recommends irrelevant content but has also shown improvement in suggesting niche channels.\n9. There is a trend of YouTube recommending small channels with low views.YouTube users discuss their opinions on the platform's algorithm for recommending videos. Some users find the algorithm helpful and enjoy discovering new content, while others dislike the limited granularity of the recommendations and believe it is biased towards shorter videos. Additionally, a few users mention using extensions or strategies to personalize their YouTube experience further, such as blocking all recommendations or only watching videos from their subscriptions feed.Many users agree that YouTube Premium is worth the investment, as it provides quality content and allows for ad-free watching. The platform also has a vast amount of educational content available for free, making it an excellent resource for learning. While some express concern over the algorithm's tendency to recommend viral videos rather than educational content, others point out that there are plenty of high-quality channels on the platform that offer informative content. The availability of such edutainment-style material has the potential to generate interest in science and even encourage people to expand their STEM skills and knowledge. Some have even argued that Gen Z has had the opportunity to spend their entire youth learning everything there is to know about their passion for free; however, others argue that not all kids have the motivation or mindset to take advantage of the resource.The post discusses the influence of YouTube on learning in children and young adults, with some arguing that educational YouTube channels and videos can impart deep understanding of various subjects, while others believe that YouTube merely provides mindless entertainment masquerading as informative or educational content. Some commenters share personal experiences of using YouTube as a learning tool to cultivate skills in programming and physics, while others express concern about kids getting locked in mindless consumption of YouTube content. Overall, the post emphasizes the importance of understanding what content young people value and using that knowledge to promote learning through YouTube.An individual expresses frustration with YouTube's addictive and viral content leading to the rot of children's brains. Others concur and offer suggestions for informative and beneficial channels such as Kurzgesagt and 3Blue1Brown. Parental influence is discussed in regards to nurturing versus nature. One individual shares a success story of their child's academic improvement with gentle encouragement at home. Another individual shares that their family member enjoys creating content and watching home-based business walkthroughs on YouTube. Overall, the discussion highlights the potential benefits and drawbacks of YouTube and how parental guidance and the content watched can impact a child's development.Some individuals find it challenging to push older family members to engage in YouTube content. Certain members feel that AI-generated content will hit dopamine circuits better than human-generated content ever could. Some feel that youth have a significant advantage because of YouTube access for learning everything there is to know about their passions for free. However, some feel that such access does not ensure learning anything useful, and most people may waste their time. Moreover, comprehensive resources to become professionally competent remain gatekept until one enters the industry, and video content does not substitute for it.People believe that YouTube is an excellent resource for learning and professional development, particularly for Gen Z who grew up with it. Many free courses and tutorials are readily available on various topics. YouTube Music is also praised for its inclusion of user uploads that commercial streaming services don't have. However, some criticize the platform for promoting low-quality amateur content and the danger of constant passive entertainment, particularly for children. A few alternatives to typical streaming services are suggested, such as the Criterion Collection and Mubi.YouTube is a valuable source of unstructured learning and motivation outside of structured processes. Canceling Spotify for YouTube premium has led to mixed experiences, with criticism of YT music's soft censorship. Gen Z should not rely solely on YouTube for professional competence without rigorous formal training. University education remains essential for lifelong networks and overall quality training. YouTube is convenient but not a replacement for interactive learning with experts and is not always a reliable source of information. YouTube has a valuable archive of old programming from the analogue age. The quality of comments on YouTube has significantly improved in recent years, but negative opinions are often shadow-banned.- YouTube comment filtering goes into a queue for moderation, allowing YouTubers to approve, delete, or ban comments and users from their channels.\n- Some larger YouTubers may not be able to moderate every comment, leading to effectively shadowbanning comments.\n- The quality of comments on YouTube has improved dramatically in the last five years, although spam bots and empty praise comments still persist.\n- Niche channels with thoughtful content used to have good comment sections, but now suffer from spam and vacuous praise. \n- Bots sometimes impersonate video creators and push crypto scams. \n- Overall, there is a mix of wholesome comments and obvious scams.",

        "hn_content": "The Tech Times reports on a Medium article about the \"dark side\" of the Mac App Store. A Hacker News user questions how Apple's processes could let spam apps through, despite other apps being rejected for tiny details. It's suggested that App Review is not consistently nitpicky, but rather randomly nitpicky. According to Apple, over 500 dedicated experts worldwide review over 100K apps per week, but this could leave a maximum of only 12 minutes for each app. Inconsistencies from reviewers and lack of resources are also present. Some Hackers suggest that reviewers are bad at their jobs, or developers use tactics to get through the system.The comments are discussing the issue of Apple's app review process, highlighting its shortcomings and calling for a more nuanced approach that accounts for the diversity of apps and users. In some cases, the current process is deemed inadequate, with apps slipping through the cracks or reviewers failing to conduct thorough evaluations. Others argue that the cost of thorough reviews is prohibitive, and that a more balanced approach is needed. It is suggested that different types of apps and users should be subject to different levels of scrutiny, with games and professional applications perhaps requiring more review. The nature of the problem is complex, and there does not appear to be a perfect solution.The article discusses the issues with Apple's app search criteria and how the search results undermine publisher trademarks. Apple's customer service response to the issue is also criticized for being unhelpful. The comments section brings up points about the security of desktops versus phones and the necessity of app review for the safety of consumers. The debate turns to side-loading and how it could be a potential solution.The article discusses the security of desktops and phones for storing sensitive data, with different opinions presented in the comments. Some argue that phones are more secure due to built-in security features and easier backups, while others argue that desktops and laptops can be secured with proper measures in place. There is also a discussion on the security of third-party apps and how they may pose a risk to users' data. Overall, the article raises the question of where the best place is to store sensitive information and how both desktops and phones can be made more secure.The app store review process is inconsistent, allowing for spam and shovelware. Apple struggles with maintaining high standards while boasting 2 million apps, far more than their normal product strategy. The costs of thoroughly reviewing each app would be astronomical, but the estimate for Apple's cut for app sales and subscriptions is 85 billion dollars. Some speculate that the lack of sideloading and the 30% cut justify Apple's human review and curation services. However, the automated system likely justifies it, with rare manual escalation for \"suspicious activity.\" The decisions may deliberately be stochastic to stop human bias. Bribery is a plausible explanation for some apps slipping through the cracks.Developers are abusing Apple's Developer Agreements by spamming multiple accounts and creating a \"cartel-style environment\" that creates unfair competition for other developers. The scamming strategy involves using automated systems that handle everything, including retries if an app was banned. The Apple App Store is a rich target because it makes serious money. The App Store review process is in need of a change, and competition is coming soon to the EU. Separately, it costs $100 per year for a developer account, but it is not a significant barrier to most developers.The Mac App Store is filled with scam apps and shady developers, even in categories like OpenAI and ChatGPT. The prevalence of garbage apps is due to the platform incentivizing developers to seek passive income. The review process does not catch scams effectively, and even legitimate apps suffer from high rates of false positives. Apple's initial vision for iOS and macOS was web-based apps, but the company changed course due to the desire for a 30% cut through the App Store. Developers are becoming disillusioned with Mac App Store due to the signal-to-noise ratio, while Linux boasts a plethora of quality software.- Apple's upcoming sideloading capability in iOS 17 is causing speculation about restrictions on API access.\n- The EU law requires gatekeepers to allow free access to hardware and software features, but it is unclear whether this includes all APIs and entitlement systems.\n- Some developers want sideloading to bypass Apple's restrictive App Store policies, while end-users want more choice.\n- Apple users may be at risk of scams due to low-quality app reviews and copycat apps.\n- It remains to be seen whether Apple will address these concerns.Developers are producing scam apps and preying on users in the Mac App Store, taking advantage of the gold rush in generative AI, with sketchy deals and review exploits. OpenAI hasn't released an official ChatGPT mobile app yet, as third-party versions proliferate in a market where there is demand, and even if there is exploitation or spamming, there could still be nothing wrong with simple OpenAI-powered apps. However, some of the apps disable exit buttons, take on review fraud or unreliable branding, and show how opaque the process of app store screening and review can be.",
        "hn_summary": "- The Mac App Store has been criticized for its inconsistent app review process, allowing for spam and shady developers to thrive.\n- The review process needs to be overhauled, possibly with different levels of scrutiny for different types of apps and users.\n- There are concerns about the security of consumer data on both desktops and phones, and whether the best place to store sensitive information is on either platform."

The comments section includes suggestions for asking for feedback, the importance of taking criticism well, and alternative ways of gauging team satisfaction. One commenter suggested asking, \"How are you feeling about X, 0-10?\" followed up by \"What would get you to a 10?\" to get team members to express their desires for improvement in a constructive way. Another commenter warned \"strong ideas loosely held\" type people to be careful when becoming managers, as they may hold onto ideas permanently.The post discusses the importance of honest communication in the workplace and how asking for feedback can provide valuable insights. However, being defensive and asking for overly vague or confrontational feedback can lead to problems. The comment section features many personal experiences of miscommunication and faux positivity in the workplace causing issues with morale and team dynamics. The advice given is that remaining on the critical path is not always the best approach and sometimes open communication and compromise is necessary. The post applies to both managers and line employees.The Tech Times published a post featuring a conversation between managers discussing what they wish they knew before becoming managers. Some of the key points include recognizing the importance of delegation, learning not to get too upset when giving feedback, and recognizing that management is a separate set of skills from being an individual contributor. The article also discusses the importance of strong communication, empathy, and earning respect from your team. There is a comment section with additional insights from readers, including the potential limitations of Twitter likes as a source of validation.Tips on managing new team members who might be struggling:\n- Talk to them and try to understand what's going on before making any judgments\n- Don't make it confrontational; have a casual discussion over coffee to understand challenges and productivity targets\n- Consider the full set of responsibilities, culture clash, and learning curve for new team members\n- Prepare for difficult conversations by understanding different perspectives\n- Experienced engineers should try management and back out if it's not for them\n- The managerial role can be unpleasant with different philosophies/styles of managementThe text content does not provide any meaningful information or context related to cutting-edge tech news or developments.

In recent years it\u2019s been getting a good name, with many of my tech peers encouraging me to try it, some of the \u201cgreats\u201d, like Steve Jobs endorsing it, and all manner of reddit anecdata about how it (or psilocybin) had changed their lives for the better, and renewed therapeutic research interests being approved for the drug.I had dabbled a bit before with psilocybin, and don\u2019t think it changed my life in any real manner other than showing me what mental illness is. I was mostly non-functional, wrapped up in blankets in my bed after eating three grams of the stuff, moving between fits of laughter and heavy bouts of anxiety while having my heart race at a million bpm the whole while. Coming back down to earth, puking all over the place, and remembering what my name was again, was the best part as it meant it was now all over.So, enter LSD. I had a reasonable idea of what I might expect, having done psilocybin once or twice before. I went on a small retreat with a few friends, and we shared a few tabs. About 160 \u00b5g later and it was similar to psilocybin: see-sawing between euphoria and dread, heart rate turned to 11, but now with cool visual effects.About six hours later, and it would be over. For most people.It turns out that if you\u2019re very unlucky, you\u2019ll have strong negative side effects that may fuck you up for the rest of your life.That\u2019s me. I was very unlucky.Before we go further, have a look at the image below:Have you ever seen this? Take a look around you right now, maybe in a dark corner, or on a flat-colored wall. Look carefully. Do you see it?Maybe you don\u2019t, or maybe it\u2019s not so animated. Do you maybe see something like this instead, on a \u2018cream colored\u2019 wall?Maybe you see it now. Or maybe you don\u2019t. It\u2019s kinda like TV static, and the \u201cdots\u201d may be monochrome or colored, \u201cmoving\u201d fast or slow or not at all. You might find it more noticeable in the dark, or in the bright. Or maybe only if you focus on it. Or, you might just not have it and that\u2019s fine too.This is called Visual Snow. I\u2019ve polled many people I know who have and haven\u2019t tried drugs. On both sides, some have had it \u201csince forever,\u201d and others have no idea what I\u2019m talking about. For those I know who do have it, it\u2019s pretty delicate and doesn\u2019t really cause problems. It\u2019s unclear what visual snow exactly is, and what causes it.Halfway through my trip, about 4 hours in, visual snow started appearing on everything.It ramped up slowly, and at it\u2019s final form it was crisp, sharp, colorful, full of motion, and a total distraction. All of the time. Always. Everywhere. I was panicking and just asking everybody:\u201cDo you all see this too ?!\u201d\u201cOh yeah, I have that. Don\u2019t worry, you learn to live with it.\u201d\u201cLEARN TO LIVE WITH IT?! No way! WTF!\u201dOn top of that, the loudest tinnitus you could imagine. I have a rather quiet tinnitus that I\u2019ve had since forever, and it really only bothers me at night. This was a second tone, high pitched, loud, and with some ringing in it. Closing my eyes left me with afterimages, and trying to read in the dark would basically blind me for real.So let\u2019s sum up. There were a number of ways I was fucked up:First, the visual snow. Frightening and painted over everything.Loud tinnitus.I couldn\u2019t drink coffee anymore. I like coffee. But even a few sips would cause me to get very jittery and terrified over nothing in particular.\u201cDepersonalization.\u201d I felt like I was experiencing life through a movie-theatre screen, and I was \u201ctrapped behind it\u201d and unable to escape.Continuous anxiety about literally nothing. I felt like a student who didn\u2019t do their homework, and was dreading their teacher calling on them - for 24 hours a day.Being really \u201csuggestible.\u201d I could think about things and they would appear as hallucinations in the corners of my vision. I could tell they weren\u2019t real though, so it wasn\u2019t exactly psychosis.Oh yeah, I had to continue to hold down a job: coding, working with people, and pretending that I wasn\u2019t brain-damaged and terrified.All of this added up to serious anxiety (read: right proper suicide and estate planning). I was pretty much convinced that I was going blind and deaf, that my life was over, and that one tiny tiny piece of paper can just fuck someone over permanently. Trying to find solace on the internet, I learned that this entire umbrella of problems was called \u201cHPPD\u201d, Hallucinogen Persisting Perception disorder.I also learned that it might never go away for some, but you might have a good shot if you cold-turkey quit all recreational drugs. So I quit everything, including alcohol and caffeine.I\u2019m happy to say that today is roughly a year since that happened, and I\u2019m basically 100% recovered. It took months, with good days and bad days, and now I\u2019m just left with delicate visual snow that I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve had since I was a kid, and is mostly ignorable unless I\u2019m looking for it. Every other issue is gone, and I enjoy coffee on the regular again (and alcohol on the very occasional basis). I\u2019ve quit every other recreational drug, and have given them all away, so I\u2019ll be staying far away.It\u2019s unclear how things turned out this way, but I think it\u2019s certain that LSD has very real and unpredictable risks for some people. Reading reddit anecdata about how LSD has changed people\u2019s lives for the better - and the army of comments that dogpile on, agreeing - makes me upset at their naiveity and harmful promotion, and I wish to just post this entire story right underneath them and scream from the rooftops about how a single dose can ruin you. If anything, I got lucky with my bad luck, and fully recovered. Some don\u2019t, and have issues for the rest of their lives.And I didn\u2019t even learn anything cool from the trip. Fuck you, Jobs.",

        "hn_content": "Discussion on the potential negative effects of LSD by users and their concerns on the lack of attention on the risks associated with its use. The conversation went into detail on how the experience can lead to destabilization and worst long-lasting emotional effects. Despite the potential risks, some users promote the use of LSD but recommend keeping the dose low to stay in the fun domain. Many users share similar experiences and vividly recall the feelings of dread and futility under the influence of LSD.Individuals discuss feeling a sense of dread linked to childhood fever dreams or psychedelic experiences. Some speculate that the sensation may result from the trauma of childbirth, neurological processes, or a universal experience during development. Others consider the risks of psychedelic use, expressing support for careful procedures and regulation to reap its benefits, while also acknowledging the dangers of psychedelic excess. Despite the worry about the psychological \"nutty\" effects, some highlight the unique qualities of pain and how limited one's perception can be.The article explores the dangers of taking psychedelics and the need for proper environments and preparedness. Some individuals have negative experiences, while others find benefits in the right setting. The importance of set and setting, low doses, good trip sitters, and \u201ctrip killers\u201d are emphasized to mitigate risk. Legalizing drugs would lead to better education and the ability to make informed decisions. Marijuana and THC can have negative effects, resulting in panic attacks or psychological and physical health concerns. Ultimately, individuals should make informed decisions, and preparedness is necessary for the safe use of mind-altering drugs.Marijuana variations in THC levels affect the intensity of the experience; labels and education help users control the buzz. Legalization has helped users access more precise dosages and smokeless options. Different strains have varying effects, but classification into sativa/indica may not be accurate. Edibles are the closest to having regulated doses. People can control intake by taking smaller doses of MJ just like with alcohol. Easing into initial stages of consumption avoids the \"whitey\" experience that hits hard. Too much THC in edibles can be dangerous. Even for users who've had bad experiences, being high may not be for everyone.A person shares their negative experience with LSD, describing strong hallucinations, time distortion, and loss of motor control, leading to panic and fear. Readers offer their perspectives on drug experiences, dosages, and the importance of set and setting. The conversation touches on the variety of LSD-like psychedelics that exist, the potential benefits of psychedelics for treating trauma and PTSD, and the need for quality control and regulation in the drug industry. The post highlights the fact that individuals may have different reactions to drugs and emphasizes the importance of caution and responsibility when experimenting with mind-altering substances.An online discussion about the positive and negative effects of psychedelic drugs, such as mushrooms and LSD, took place on Hacker News. Some users shared their personal experiences, such as living in isolation in the Catskills with mushrooms and the negative effects of LSD on their mental health. Others debate the risks and benefits of these substances and advocate for caution when using them. The discussion also highlighted the potential harm in promoting these drugs as entirely harmless, despite possible side effects when taken improperly. The thread touched on the need for personal responsibility and respecting the complexity of these substances.The post discusses the potential risks and effects of taking LSD. The author emphasizes the importance of being aware of possible complications and researching how psychedelics may interact with other drugs or pre-existing conditions. Readers share their own experiences with LSD, some positive and some negative, and discuss the balance between potential risks and rewards. The author argues against relying solely on anecdotal evidence and emphasizes the need for accurate statistics on the effects of psychedelics.  Overall, the post highlights the complexity and potential consequences of experimenting with LSD.An article on Reddit prompts discussion on the effects of LSD, and whether the risks outweigh the benefits. Some claim that there is a popular misconception that LSD promotes some sort of transformative or therapeutic effect. Others argue that there are true benefits to psychedelic substances, such as marijuana, despite exaggerations of efficacy claims. Despite limited scientific research, some readers claim that they have always had experiences of visual snow, or \"Eigengrau.\" Ultimately, the article seeks to provide nuanced views on the controversial and disputed benefits of psychedelic substances.People are discussing their experiences with visual noise and tinnitus after taking psychedelics such as LSD and shrooms. Some believe that using these drugs can \"reset\" the mind and have positive long-term effects, while others warn of potential risks, particularly for those with existing mental health issues. Many suggest taking caution when trying psychedelics and starting with smaller, safe doses in a controlled environment. One user notes that visual noise and tinnitus are essentially perception noise and may be connected to the resetting of \"noise filters\" in the brain. Overall, the discussion highlights the varied and complex effects of psychedelics on the mind and body.Taking LSD or psilocybin while on SSRI antidepressants may lead to serotonin syndrome. Some supplements like St. John's wort and ginseng can also trigger this condition. Psychedelics can cause profound experiences, but their real purpose and origin remain unknown. Datura metel, a psychoactive plant, has mysterious Asian origins. A high dose of psilocybin taken alone at home is risky. Long-term side effects of drugs on parts of the brain can occur. People should test their drugs before taking them. Taking drugs is an uncontrolled scientific experiment, and gradual intake is recommended. There is pressure to use psychedelics, and some may feel excluded if they refuse to use them. All drugs have risks, and people should weigh their pros and cons before using them.Taking a limitless pill isn't beneficial due to its side-effects like tolerance, dependence, and burnout. Doctors typically start patients on low doses and titrate up to avoid such issues. Different drugs have different effects; for example, tripping on magic mushrooms may cause an individual to lose their focus and become unproductive, but microdosing can help one connect with others and increase creativity. However, it's essential to consider the risk associated with it. Lastly, the effects of psychedelics differ from person-to-person and dose to dose.A user's account of experiencing tinnitus after taking a high dose of LSD sparks discussion about the importance of set and setting. Some users express sympathy but suggest that the individual should have known better. Others draw comparisons to alcohol or personal experiences with other substances. The post highlights the potential risks and importance of responsible drug use, and raises awareness about potential effects that may not be widely documented.",

        "hn_content": "A recent study suggests that bilingualism does not offer significant cognitive advantages. However, some commenters argue that the study misses the point because the cultural enrichment provided by learning another language is more impactful than any cognitive differences. Learning a language exposes you to the culture and understanding of its people, and language and culture are inseparable. Some commenters also note that the study focuses exclusively on adult bilingualism, which may not accurately reflect the benefits of being raised in a bilingual environment. Popular beliefs about bilingualism and cognitive abilities may not be entirely accurate.A debate on whether bilingual children have an advantage over monolingual children in executive functioning has been ongoing. A recent study aimed to debunk this urban legend, stating that bilingualism does not confer significant cognitive advantages. The study also noted that learning a second language as an adult or adolescent makes learning additional languages more accessible. Multilingualism can broaden horizons by opening up new opportunities for knowledge and experiences, including engagement with different cultures. However, being bilingual doesn't necessarily provide doors to work perspective.A discussion is ongoing about the cognitive advantages of being bilingual or multilingual. Some people argue that speaking multiple languages is an advantage in terms of free time and income, while others feel that it adds unnecessary cognitive load. However, an academic paper suggests that if being bilingual has any benefit over and above broader social gains, it should manifest as a cognitive advantage in the general bilingual population. The paper has surprised many, as some argue that knowing another language enhances one's understanding of one's own language and can improve cognition, especially in verbal thinking.Readers discuss the benefits of speaking multiple languages, including increased access to media, the ability to connect with people, and a deeper understanding of cultural nuances. Some commenters note that knowing more languages can be helpful in the business world or when traveling abroad. However, the linked study suggests that being multilingual might not confer any cognitive advantages in terms of performing executive tasks.Learning multiple languages can provide unique perspectives and cognitive benefits, but some may find it difficult to switch between languages when trying to express ideas. However, many activities can be useful and entertaining, rather than solely studying languages. Some people find language diversification keeps them sharp, while others may experience a cognitive load from constantly switching languages. Personal experiences vary widely, with some finding language benefits outweigh any difficulties.Learning multiple languages can become easier once you learn to stick to one language at a time, according to commenters on a tech forum discussing language acquisition. Some commenters suggest that studying versus growing up in a multilingual environment may result in different challenges for speakers. Mixing words between studied languages seems to be more common than mixing words from one's native tongue into multiple languages. Language proficiency may also depend on how often the language is used, with some commenters experiencing language erosion after long periods of disuse. Ultimately, learning multiple languages can be both enjoyable and practical, but fluency requires consistent effort and immersion.The post explores the topic of bilingualism and how it affects cognitive abilities. There are mixed views on the subject, with some arguing that speaking multiple languages improves cognitive ability, while others argue that it adds unnecessary cognitive load. The discussion includes personal experiences of being multilingual, learning a second language, and the challenges that come with it. It also includes recommendations for language-learning resources, such as the Assimil Dutch course. Learning different languages challenges assumptions and strengthens the ability to distinguish concepts more clearly. The study discusses acquired languages and how it ignores multiple languages learned in childhood.A thread about the benefits and drawbacks of speaking multiple languages took place on Hacker News. One of the contributors pointed out a study that contradicts the one presented initially, which suggests a negative correlation between bilingualism and poverty. Another post cited research that indicates bilingual people are better at detecting manipulative speech. More specifically, several comments reflected on the effects of strokes on multilingual individuals. Finally, several people debated the value of learning a second language and whether it is worth the investment, while others were more drawn to the subject for personal reasons.Several commenters on a forum discussed the usefulness of learning different languages. German is not particularly useful globally, but it is still spoken in several countries; many Germans also do not speak fluent English. Cantonese is spoken in the US and could be learned for fun, but Mandarin is more useful for business or travel. In contrast, Spanish is spoken in an entire continent and has similarities to other Latin languages. Access to quality public education was also touched upon. A PDF for a study on cognitive advantages of bilingualism was shared.An observational study on bilingualism does not fully capture the differences between bilingual and non-bilingual people. Bilingualism adds cognitive advantage but not exactly an advantage for the general public. Learning a second language is a pragmatic choice and not about some vaguely suggestive idea of increased cognition but directly about what learning that language will offer. Bilingualism is not going to make you better at general problem solving but will come in handy on occasion in that you will see the problem from a perspective. Learning multiple languages from a very early age seems to result in the languages being a single language from the perspective of the speaker, and second and third languages are very different things between those that learned them from the start and those that learn them later in life.Learning a programming language is different from understanding its underlying mechanics, and while having knowledge of related languages helps, it may still be challenging to learn a new language. Linguistics and computer science study what languages have in common, but knowledge of these fields does not necessarily make learning new languages easier. Being bilingual does not always offer cognitive advantages. Having a theoretical understanding of a language does not guarantee proficiency in communication. While studying foundational/fundamental language may be beneficial, it does not necessarily help in everyday communication where function over form matters.Learning linguistics may be useful in studying multiple languages, as it helps identify commonalities between them. Humanities should not only assert its value in utilitarian terms because several benefits come from studying it. Being multilingual can unlock different personalities and disrupt mental inertia. Moreover, people somehow shift personalities when speaking another language while some become warmer and more affectionate. However, bilingualism has varying degrees of benefits depending on differences between the languages. Speaking multiple languages can also aid in finding commonalities across different cultures. Finally, people believe some myths about education because of social desirability bias.A study investigating the cognitive advantages of bilingualism found that bilingual individuals are not generally smarter than their monolingual peers, leading to questioning of the assumption that bilingualism bestows cognitive benefits. The study, with a sample size of over 11,000, found that the matched control groups showed no significant difference in cognitive ability between bilingual and monolingual individuals. While bilingualism is not deemed to confer cognitive benefits by the study, it is suggested that voluntary bilingualism provides practical advantages in the work environment and living in a multicultural society. Critics pointed out issues with the study's methodology and selection of control groups.A discussion on whether speaking multiple languages correlates with intelligence or socioeconomic status. Some argue that bilingualism can give access to knowledge in different domains, but others point out that learning languages can be a result of immigration or family influence. The benefits of knowing multiple languages may include the ability to understand and communicate with more people, enjoy more cultural productions, and distinguish between the words and their meanings. Overall, speaking another language is a social advantage that can increase opportunities in life.Participants on an online forum discuss the nuances of language and the benefits of being bilingual, including increased access to knowledge and understanding original texts. Some bring up the role of British colonialism in English language propagation, while others note that English has been influenced by French and other languages over time. The conversation spans multiple languages and countries, highlighting the global nature of language and its importance in communication and access to information.

The study also found that the \"biomolecular corona,\" which forms around the surface of particles, is critical in determining if they can pass through the BBB. Modeling showed that cholesterol molecules enhance uptake while the protein model inhibits it.Scientists have used computer models and animal experiments to study the transfer of plastic nanoparticles through the blood-brain barrier. Polystyrene was used as the modelling material, with the team finding that plastic with a thin cholesterol corona easily entered the barrier but couldn't exit it and access neural tissue. The study highlighted the role of the corona in the transfer and found that protein coronae affected the thermodynamics of particle diffusion into the barrier. The researchers also found that 0.293-micron PS particles could cross the gastrointestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier within two hours, according to animal tests.Researchers at Medical University of Vienna have developed models to show that polystyrene (PS) plastic particles are able to enter/cross the blood-brain barrier depending on their specific surface corona, an outer layer of proteins and other biomolecules that can accumulate on the surface of plastic particles when they are exposed to biological fluids. They found that in vivo mouse models showed accumulations of signals of nanometer-sized PS particles in brain tissues as early as 2 hr after exposure. The type of corona can significantly impact toxicity, hence future research is needed to fully understand the health implications and toxic mechanisms of MNP (micro- and nanoplastics).A study published in the journal Nanomaterials reveals that micro- and nanoplastics can breach the blood-brain barrier (BBB), where they can accumulate in the brain and potentially cause toxic effects. The study found that biomolecular corona, which is a coating that forms on the surface of nanoparticles in contact with bodily fluids, can mediate the interaction of plastics with the BBB. The study used molecular dynamics simulations to show how polystyrene nanoparticles diffuse across a model blood-brain barrier, and fluorescent nanoplastics were found in mouse brains just two hours after administration.",

        "hn_content": "Micro and nano plastics have been found to breach the blood-brain barrier in mice, according to a study published in the MDPI journal. This has raised concerns about the potential negative health impacts on humans, but the science has not yet shown the extent of the potential harm. Views on the findings were mixed, with some advocating for the Precautionary Principle while waiting for science to catch up, while others express concern about the misapplication of it. Some recommendations have been suggested to address the issue, such as regular blood or plasma donation or developing methods to remove micro and nanoplastics from the body.A study has shown that nanoplastics can breach the blood-brain barrier when ingested, but it is unclear how much of this occurs in humans with exposure to microplastics. Removal seems difficult, but reduction in plastic use could help with health and environmental issues. While microplastics can now be found in tissues of all major organs of donated human cadavers, the severity of the impact to human health still needs more research to conclude. The study looks at how smaller nanoparticles from larger microplastics break off and into the brain.Nanoplastic particles can cross the gastrointestinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier in a short time, with 0.293 \u00b5m sized particles able to penetrate the BBB. The most important question is whether they are cleared over time, or if they are bioaccumulative like heavy metals, and if there is a way to clear them from the body. The size of the particles may be a critical factor in their ability to penetrate the BBB. More research is needed to determine the effect of these plastics on brain function, and their interaction with brain tissues. There is a serious argument to be made to ban synthetic textiles, a significant source of microplastics, in areas where they can be replaced with cotton. Personal action can have an effect on reducing the ingestion of microplastics, with plastic water bottles containing about two orders of magnitude more microplastics than regular tap water.Microplastics can enter the body in trace amounts from everyday plastics breakdown. Governments should fund a UBI with Pigovian taxes to address the increasing number of negative externalities, including plastics. It is possible to gradually reduce plastic use and find alternatives. Scientists are researching the presence of microplastics in the brain of mice. Animal testing is necessary for medical interventions, and lab animals are kept in regulated conditions. The experiment doesn't further anything about plastics in human brains and is considered pointless and cruel by some. Grad students and lead researchers in the field aren't paid as well as corporate jobs.A grad student asks about their potential income, to which someone responds with average stipend figures. The discussion then shifts to a recent study finding microplastics in human blood, and the ethics of animal testing. No new or exciting tech developments were mentioned. Overall, the post provides insight into the lives of grad students and ethical considerations in scientific research.",

        "hn_content": "A user on Hacker News has shared a frustration with the pricing and usability of PagerDuty and other on-call management tools. They have created their own alternative, All Quiet, which focuses on easy integration and incident escalation policies. Other users have also criticized PagerDuty's poor implementation of calendar management, cross-regional scheduling, and vacation time. The comments suggest that the purchase of such tools is often a top-down affair, with user ergonomics not prioritized. The post provides insights into the challenges and desires of on-call management tool users and highlights potential opportunities for better solutions.PagerDuty has largely solved the problem of ensuring the right people receive alerts relating to outages but is expensive thanks to its redundancy offerings involving multiple providers. Companies often don't properly consider the budgets and timescales needed for tools like these prior to purchasing. Pagerduty's UI is described as garbage and its uptime requirement for reliability is close to 100%. Alternative to PagerDuty: Heii On-Call, but financial incentives may require more robust integration services. PagerDuty is built on AWS for all functionality.- Many SAAS companies like Auth0, Okta, and Datadog only operate in a single region in AWS, leaving customers vulnerable to global outages.\n- A fire drill feature as part of on-call rotation can help prevent misconfigurations that lead to missed alerts.\n- Uptime Kuma is a promising open-source alternative to PagerDuty, with a polished user experience, frequent updates, PostgreSQL and Docker monitoring, and a long list of notification services supported.\n- Grafana OnCall is another OSS alternative with cloud offerings and self-hosting capabilities.\n- PagerDuty's notification settings customizable, but users would like more granular control for escalating alerts.\n- All Quiet notifications are app-only and do not have other channels like call and text, which some users find unreliable.\n- Design choices with notification channels seem more about development priority than actual feature benefits.Comments on the reliability and notification methods of PagerDuty, with a focus on phone call notifications being the most reliable. Some users express frustration with PagerDuty's pricing model and share alternative solutions. Several comments discuss issues with PagerDuty's interface and reliability, with some users expressing a desire for more competition in the space. Some users share negative experiences with PagerDuty's sales and account management practices.All Quiet, a new alternative to PagerDuty, has been launched with a focus on easy escalation level management and empowering teams to take responsibility for their software. The app-only notification system is designed to be more affordable than PagerDuty, which is said to charge \"minibar rates\" for metric data storage. One user reported a bill of up to $8k due to \"forceful\" yearly contracts to purchase unnecessary seats. Some users expressed interest in options for other forms of notification and smarter escalations, while others praised the app's simplicity and differentiation from competitors.- A Pagerduty clone built on AWS can reach a maximum availability of 99.99%\n- All Quiet's availability is unknown because it's not published\n- A frustrated user is developing their own solution as an alternative to Pager Duty, but it may not offer all the same features\n- Someone questions another's unhelpful comment about the project\n- YC Summer 2023 applications are now open.",
