    "originBody": "Home Lives of Philosophers Daniel Dennett (1942-2024) By Dustin Sigsbee . April 19, 2024 at 10:59 am 38 Daniel Dennett, professor emeritus of philosophy at Tufts University, well-known for his work in philosophy of mind and a wide range of other philosophical areas, has died. Professor Dennett wrote extensively about issues related to philosophy of mind and cognitive science, especially consciousness. He is also recognized as having made significant contributions to the concept of intentionality and debates on free will. Some of Professor Dennett’s books include Content and Consciousness (1969), Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and Psychology (1981), The Intentional Stance (1987), Consciousness Explained (1992), Darwin’s Dangerous Idea (1995), Breaking the Spell (2006), and From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds (2017). He published a memoir last year entitled I’ve Been Thinking. There are also several books about him and his ideas. You can learn more about his work here. Professor Dennett held a position at Tufts University for nearly all his career. Prior to this, he held a position at the University of California, Irvine from 1965 to 1971. He also held visiting positions at Oxford, Harvard, Pittsburgh, and other institutions during his time at Tufts University. Professor Dennett was awarded his PhD from the University of Oxford in 1965 and his undergraduate degree in philosophy from Harvard University in 1963. Professor Dennett is the recipient of several awards and prizes including the Jean Nicod Prize, the Mind and Brain Prize, and the Erasmus Prize. He also held a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences. An outspoken atheist, Professor Dennett was dubbed one of the “Four Horsemen of New Atheism”. He was also a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, an honored Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism, and was named Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Organization. He died this morning from complications of interstitial lung disease.* The following interview with Professor Dennett was recorded last year: (via Eric Schliesser) Related: “Philosophers: Stop Being Self-Indulgent and Start Being Like Daniel Dennett, says Daniel Dennett“. (Other DN posts on Dennett can be found here.) *This was added after the initial publication of the post. Source: New York Times.

I agree with folks like Andrew Brook and Don Ross that Dennett (on whom I have written) built a full philosophical system. His last interview must have been a YouTube chat with Jordan Peterson, just days ago. Looking back now, I am even more annoyed that Peterson (on whom I have also written) spoke so much and listened so little… R.I.P., mister Dennett. 46 Reply Quill Reply to Marc Champagne 18 hours ago What a total waste of a final moment for a great philosopher 54 Reply Oktober Reply to Quill 17 hours ago Not shameful to get your ideas out to an audience that might not otherwise hear them. 26 Reply Quill Reply to Oktober 17 hours ago He didn’t though, as Marc points out. 8 Reply Bob Reply to Quill 15 hours ago Dennett would be amused. 4 Reply Jack Abaza Reply to Marc Champagne 16 hours ago He was my favourite philosopher.

I still teach “Where Am I?” at least once a year. RIP. 14 Reply David Wallace 16 hours ago Over and above his individual contributions, which were many and towering, Daniel Dennett exemplified what it means to do philosophy in a way that engages critically but constructively with science and with scientists. He once wrote that “There is no philosophy-free science; there is only science whose philosophical baggage was taken on board without examination”, but he recognized more clearly than almost anyone in philosophy how transformed its own deepest questions were by modern science, most of all by the theory of evolution. These are lessons that have penetrated deeply into areas of philosophy far from Dennett’s own home territory: his work has had a great influence on modern philosophy of physics, for instance. (He has been one of the greatest inspirations and exemplars for my own work.) He was one of the greatest philosophers of the last century, and one of the very few who have had a transformative influence far beyond academic philosophy. This is a devastating loss. 35 Reply Quill Kukla 16 hours ago Ok when I first heard this news a couple of hours ago, I said that I didn’t have anything interesting to say, I was just sad. But now that I’ve had a couple of hours to process I do want to share a story. I have many wonderful Daniel Dennett stories but this one is my favorite. Dan took an interest in me when I was finishing undergraduate. Because I was full of chutzpa and had no sense of professional norms, I sent him a paper of mine out of the blue and asked him if it would be possible to come do an MA with him. He wrote back and explained to me that the MA program at Tufts was really for people who weren’t quite ready for a PhD program and told me that instead I should go to the best PhD program I could and then come to a postdoc with him later, a generous offer that I ended up never taking up for complicated reasons. Five and a half years after that, I was on the full-on philosophy job market for the first time. I applied for a job at Tufts, and sent in a writing sample. He was not on the search committee but apparently got excited that I had applied and read my application. The paper I submitted was on Rousseau, which incidentally could not be farther from his areas. Apparently in three places in the essay I mistyped “freedom” as “freeedom.” Dan spontaneously wrote like this 1500 word essay entitled “On Kukla’s Distinction between ‘Freedom’ and ‘Freeedom'”, giving this huge elaborate and absolutely hilarious close interpretation of my purported distinction between the two concepts. He sent it to me via snail mail, printed out, with a lovely note saying that he hoped it would work out for me to come to Tufts. It did not, in the end, but it was the most charming and funny and thoughtful and attentive thing that a senior philosopher has ever done for me. I have no idea how somebody as busy as Daniel Dennett could possibly have found the time to do this, for no reason other than to playfully engage with me and demonstrate that he took me, a 24 year old “girl” who was nobody and who was not even his student, seriously. 100 Reply McFarland Duncan Reply to Quill Kukla 15 hours ago Wonderful story 6 Reply Mick D Coleman Reply to McFarland Duncan 10 hours ago When you talk about yourself as “nobody”, you discredit yourself and anyone who saw your potential. 1 Reply Lucy Weir 16 hours ago Attitude is spirit! Your spirit lives on in the attitudes of curiosity, meticulous research, and generous sharing. Thank you, Dan. 4 Reply M.B.Ranjbar 15 hours ago It is very sad that the world of science and philosophy lost a great person like Daniel Dennet. His views on brain function were innovative and interesting. I read several of his books that were also translated to Persian. They were excellent, especially “From Bacteria to Bach and back”. 3 Reply Simon DeDeo 15 hours ago Academia survives in part because there are wonderful scholars (thoughtful, intense, creative) who happen to be wonderful human beings (kind, open to cold-calls, gentle with people at an earlier stage of emotional development). Dan was certainly one of these people. But he was also something more, which perhaps accounts for the fact that I was in tears this morning when I heard the news. For many of us, Dan was a companion from adolescence well before we ever — if we did — meet him in person. I ended up in cognitive science in part because of the voice I encountered, in his pages, at the age of 14. So losing him feels like losing a part of one’s self. Dan was continually, radically, accessible. In a funny, odd way, he was the Anglo-American Zizek — making sense of past confusions in a way that the intelligent amateur could use to enrich their world. Without Dan, we’d have been immeasurably poorer not just as scholars, but also for the scholars who wouldn’t exist but for his exoteric work. 15 Reply Michael Lynch 14 hours ago Dan was hugely influential on me as a philosopher and writer. We first met when I was a graduate student and while I didn’t see him regularly, we kept up a long-running discussion over the years about intentionality, consciousness, AI, truth and sailing–the last because that was something we both enjoyed. He taught me how to both write serious philosophy and speak to a wider audience at the same time, and he cheered me on at my first philosophy talk at Tufts and at my first big-stage TED talk. (His presence made me way more nervous than having Steven Spielberg and Al Gore sitting in front of me). I consider him one of the best, and the world will be less bright without him in it. 11 Reply UOJ 14 hours ago Dan was the ultimate intellectual and a super mensch. He will be sorely missed! 1 Reply Ilkka Pättiniemi 14 hours ago Dennett, I believe, was the last great verificationist. The world of philosophy is the worse for his loss. We need more like him, not less. 3 Reply john sundman 13 hours ago In 2003 I wrote an long essay for Salon on the then state of ‘artificial intelligence’ in general, and the Loebner chatbot Turing test competition in particular. In the course of my research I spoke with Dan Dennett by phone and email about his initial support of, and later repudiation of the Loebner competition. I found some of what he had to say unconvincing, and in my essay I poked fun at him. A few years later Douglas Hofstadter — another person I had met only through email and telephone — was to be in town to give a lecture in one of Dennett’s evening seminars at Tufts, and he invited me to attend his lecture and then join him and Dennett and a few others for dinner. I accepted, but I was extremely nervous. After all, these people were famous intellectuals and I was just some guy who wrote a story for Salon. Hofstadter brought a copy of my essay to the dinner, and kept reading from all the parts where I had made fun of Dennett. Dennett, for his part, was an extremely good sport about it all, and it ended up being a thoroughly enjoyable outing. When the check came, Dennett insisted on paying for my meal. I blogged about the whole experience in my post ‘Mindful of Philosophy,’ which has a lot more background on Dennett, the turning test, the Loebner competition, the dinner party, and all that. He was a true gentleman and I feel lucky to have met him. 6 Reply Jack Abaza 12 hours ago Philosophy has just lost one of its most powerful voices and heroes. Daniel Dennett was a member of the critically endangered species of polymath, a talent that is becoming less and less common while social media, artificial intelligence, religious dogma, and restrictive government policies creep in to make us, humans, more and more thoughtless, lucrative, and tax-worthy. He was a genius of rare abilities to the extreme, a philosopher who neuroscientists considered one of their own. A person of this sort is born, perhaps, once every few centuries, and we didn’t appreciate how lucky we were to have lived alongside him. Now, Daniel C. Dennett is joining the long line of philosophy’s greatest thinkers who are forever etched in our thoughts and memories. If the theists are right, and God exists, then it won’t bode well for the theists who insultingly write on his X (Twitter) profile that he’s now at God’s mercy. Rather, it’s the other way around: that deity will have to watch out if he knows what’s good for him. Heaven is under new management, and God just got a demotion for two thousand years of such incompetently sloppy work. I imagine him rolling up his sleeve, as he storms into God’s office, saying “Move aside, oaf! It’s going to literally take a genius to unravel the mess you made since time immemorial!” As a titan who towers among the giants of philosophy, of old and new, and whose legendary eccentricity, exceptional brilliance, and peerlessly witty humour were too much for one discipline to handle, a great void, vast like a supermassive black hole at the epicenter of a galaxy with an insatiable hunger to devour all in its path, has emerged abruptly. I know that, if he were here, he’d tell us to get our acts together and continue what he started. There is so much to be done in philosophy, and Dennett gave it his all, fighting the dogma, intolerance, and cruelties of religions, and the myriad forms of ignorance taking up the anodyne appearances of “theories” in various disciplines. Don’t let instrumentalism die. The best way to honour our fallen champion is by rallying by his memory and legacies and finishing what he started. If there is a theism-versus-atheism debate, bring up his name. If there is some mumbo-jumbo about free will or consciousness, bring up his name; dilute the idea of unconstrained free will; reduce consciousness to a series of memes! Cite his name in your articles and books, and keep citing him. Let’s build on his theories and make instrumentalism a dominant perspective, not only in philosophy but in society at large. No matter what anyone says, Dennett didn’t “die”; he merely took on another form as our collective thoughts. He is now bigger than ever; theists will never be able to shake him off. And the best way to keep him alive is by building on his legacy. Tonight, I toast to a legendary man whose accomplishments would require too many volumes to list and explain here. Long live Daniel Dennett (1942– ) and instrumentalism! 1 Reply Anderson Brown 12 hours ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCcdmoHktOU 0 Reply Matthew Murphy 10 hours ago We will not fully understand the magnitude of this loss for a long time.

This loss feels very personal even though I didn’t know him at all. Perhaps RIP wouldn’t make much sense given he was one of the four Horsemen, but his body of work will live on considerably longer. 1 Reply Rob Wilson 8 hours ago Dan Dennett is very high on my list of favourite people in philosophy. Here are some personal vignettes that indicate why. Dan gave a talk at Cornell while I was a grad student there around the time that “Real Patterns” was published in J.Phil, a paper much of the faculty was skeptical about. The talk was “Two Black Boxes” and the commentary I gave on it in the Discussion Club was the first talk I gave in the USA. Dan was very generous and encouraging through the visit, in contrast to the general competitiveness, mean-spiritedness, and hierarchy that permeated philosophy of mind at the time. As a newly-minted PhD, I would see Dan at conferences, such as the Society for Philosophy and Psychology and the APA. At one of these, he taught me not humility but humiliation. Not the phenomenon, but game: name a book you haven’t read but you should have, as indicated by how many others playing have read it—the more who have, the higher your score. (It derives from David Lodge’s Changing Places, but, alas, at that time, that was one of those books I hadn’t read but should have.). 5-6 of us played it at a bar, crammed into a booth, with Dan taking delight in leading the way. I remember him exclaiming “No!” when I produced both Quine’s Word and Object and Wittgenstein’s Philosophical Investigations. One story this prompted from Dan was his recounting finding himself, as an undergraduate at Harvard, in one of Quine’s classes, where the philosophy graduate students seemed “wickedly smart”—it turns out that that class included a number of people who quickly became superstars in philosophy, the most notably of whom was David Lewis. Dan noted that he wasn’t sure if he belonged in that group, but thankfully he went on to work with Gilbert Ryle at Oxford, writing a D.Phil. that became Content and Consciousness. Dan was one in a cast of stellar keynotes at a conference on metarepresentation that another Dan, Dan Sperber, organised in Vancouver in 1997. I got a last-minute invite after someone else dropped out, giving a talk that meshed together some early extended cognition thinking a la wide computation with some evolutionary psychology bashing. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby were amongst the illuminati in the audience, which made that all the more nerve-racking. I remember walking away from my talk with Dan literally giving me an enthusiastic “two-thumbs up” from the corner of the front row. In more recent years, amongst the various Dennett-fests that were organised was one in Poland, more-than-coinciding with a book tour for From Bach to Bacteria (I think) and its translation into Polish. I accepted an invitation to speak at the otherwise spacetime awkward conference—I was in the process of moving from Canada to Australia—primarily to pay my respects to Dan, not having seen him for some years. The highlight was a happenstance breakfast with him alone for an hour on one of the mornings before the day got under way. It was an opportunity to talk more about the importance of his early support for Ruth Millikan (e.g., see the preface to Language, Thought, and Other Biological Categories), for junior scholars, and to make it clear how he had made a positive difference to my own pathway in philosophy. Vale Dan! 5 Reply",

Along with Hofstader, his ideas were foundational to hacker culture. What a time to go, where there has been a kind of cog.sci winter for the last 20 years, but the last year of LLMs has forced philosophy of mind back into the public consciousness. Though largely today under the guise of \"AI Safety\" and \"alignment,\" Dennet's articulations form the tools we're going to be using to reason about ethics as they relate to these things we think of as minds - and regarding how we relate to these things that increasingly resemble other minds. Without too much lionizing (even though he has, however, just died), it would be hard to say that new ideas in philosophy as a whole have had more impact in a lifetime or more than that. A lot of very clever people disagreed strongly with him. However, since not one of them could deny they were shaped by the forces they opposed, those controversies became the shape of his own huge and formidable influence. I'm sure he would want to be remembered for something else, and I have the sense sentimentality was not his thing at all, but his popularization the term \"deepity,\" was in the character of many of his ideas, where once you had been exposed to one, it yielded a perspective you could afterwards not unsee. I hope an afterlife may provide some of the surprise and delight he brought to so many in this one. reply seydor 13 hours agoparentAI safety is moralism of the boring kind, not even some new moral philosophy.

May his memory be eternal. reply pmarreck 15 hours agorootparentprevI think it would. Even if he was wrong about it, it's important to air the thinking around it regardless of belief. The proposition, for example, that consciousness is basically an illusion without empirical basis, one would have to take up as belief, I guess (paradoxically), since to most of us, that would seem like gaslighting (i.e., \"if your conclusion is that Descartes was wrong and that we can't even know we are conscious, then I beg to differ\") reply mensetmanusman 8 hours agorootparentI think that I think, therefore I think I am. reply samatman 15 hours agoparentprev> Along with Hofstadter, his ideas were foundational to hacker culture. Dennett was an influential thinker, probably more so than Hofstadter overall, but I can't agree with this assessment. For one thing, he became widely known after Consciousness Explained, in 1992, which is simply too late to be foundational to hacker culture, which was well and truly founded by then. I won't broaden my case here, lest anything I say be interpreted as speaking ill of the dead. I'm certain he was a major influence for many who post here, yourself included, and I don't intend to detract from that. reply PaulDavisThe1st 15 hours agorootparentMaybe you discovered Dennett after 1992, but he was a well-known and widely published philosopher long before. \"Elbow Room: the varieties of free will worth wanting\" was a landmark work and was published in 1984. \"The Minds I\" (w/Hofstadter) was, relatively speaking, a hugely popular work published in 1981. In 1993, the cover of \"Dennett and his critics\" began > Daniel Dennett is arguably one of the most influential yet radical philosophers in America today. Doesn't sound much like someone who \"became widely known\" after a book published in 1992. reply ska 12 hours agorootparentYou both have a point. Hacker culture was well established by the 70s, so still a decade before Dennett's earlier works. I do think its true that some of his work has resonated with many people who also resonate with \"hacker culture\". reply PaulDavisThe1st 11 hours agorootparentHacker culture was not well established by the 70s, simply because so few people worked with computers in that decade. You can certainly trace its roots back to at least 1970, but it really did not become established then. What most people identify as \"hacker culture\" today arose in tandem with (a) relatively affordable \"personal\" computers (b) modem-based communication. The rise of these two things is more or less entirely cotemporal with the most productive phase of Dennett's career. reply BlueTemplar 8 hours agorootparentDidn't a bunch of hackers start up as phreakers ? reply samatman 9 hours agorootparentprevThe book Hackers was first published in 1984 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Compute... Jargon file was published as The Hacker's Dictionary in 1983 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File I consider this definitive evidence that the foundational period of hacker culture was before these books were published. I'm not sure what the point of trying to shift that period forward so as to include Dennett's works is. It's neither true nor necessary. reply PaulDavisThe1st 7 hours agorootparentShifting it forward? His first three books were published in 81, 84 and 86. I agree with you that the foundational period slightly predates these, but I don't consider the foundational period to be the same as when \"hacker culture was established\". I began to encounter it myself starting in about 1979 via CoEvolution Quarterly/Whole Earth Review, but it was still very, very much evolving and continued to do so in very noticeable ways as I started programming in 1984. I tend to consider the general use of IP as probably one of the main signifiers of hacker culture being established, and that was far from common in the 75-85 period (though growing rapidly). reply biofox 10 hours agorootparentprevI'd argue hacker culture goes back much further than the 70s, e.g., with MIT hacks during the 1930s and 40s (see Feynman) and in Cambridge UK, as well as the early HAM radio enthusiasts in the 1900s... reply PaulDavisThe1st 7 hours agorootparentThere are certainly antecedents and ancestors for hacker culture long before the 1970s, but in the post I was replying to, the term used was \"hacker culture was established\", and I would argue that none of these early anticipatory elements represented the \"establishment\" of a new culture. reply Retric 6 hours agorootparentIt’s the same culture made by the same people entering and leaving across that full period. Hacker culture is really a continuation of the same ad hock machinist culture dating back to the Industrial Revolution. It jumped to computers from the days of analog computers. You can trace things flowing all over the place with say MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club being often sited as an early example. But it’s really just refinements of the same basic culture, and computers is one of the few places it survived unlike say pinball. reply beacon294 6 hours agorootparentI think about this a lot with reference to the mechanics institute in San Francisco. Who were these mechanics and why did they have a 4 story institute still home to a chess club and private library? Certainly not a direct crossover to a modern car mechanic, even a \"hacker\" type car mechanic wouldn't stereotypically also be thinking along the philosophy of hacker culture, although I am sure some do. reply Upvoter33 4 hours agorootparentprevAgree.

Echoing your endorsement of Brainstorms — I expect/hope this will be his enduring legacy! Death touches us all, but I totally agree, it especially hurts me to see these AI pioneers passing away right when so many groundbreaking cognitive science discoveries are being made. Especially in the cases of Dennett’s “opposition” like Lenat (and soon Chomsky…) where they die appearing “disproven” or “outmoded” by LLMs in the eyes of Silicon Valley celebrities like Hinton and Friedman. Oh well, I’m sure their time on their earth has prepared them for a little bit of criticism and uncertainty, a-la Schopenhauer’s “Only with time, however, will the period of my real influence begin, and I trust that it will be a long one.” Luckily, Dennett is under no such cloud, and he died more or less a hero in my eyes; certainly among the most influential Connectionist philosophers (+ Dreyfus & Clark?), who seemed very helpful in re-legitimizing ML. I, for one, don’t think it would be odd to see philosophers like Dennett and Hofstadter in a Turing Award announcement someday… reply Optimal_Persona 14 hours agoparentprevWhat do you mean by \"cog.sci winter of the last 20 years\"? The research of Dr. Bruce Perry, Bessel van der Kolk and others into the effects of trauma on brain development, behavior and social functioning has had a profound impact on the understanding of cognition, the mind-body continuum, and the treatment of human suffering in this time frame. https://earlylearningnation.com/2023/02/author-bruce-perry-a... reply stevofolife 14 hours agorootparentI think what he means is that many of the seminal work related to cognitive science were produced back then. For example, Chomsky, Minsky, John Searle, David Chalmers and many more. Things still move during winter, just not as much. reply scoofy 15 hours agoprevMy background is in Analytic Philosophy, so I'm fairly familiar with Dennett. His rise to prominence during the early 2000's seemed appropriate given the huge shift in American religious belief. Though, I still certainly understand that folks can be exasperated by that movement, I just don't think that you can experience a 30% drop in religious affiliation, in a single generation, without annoying people.[1] I read his book Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon, which I found really interesting in that I'd never thought about religion as a concept being an evolutionary adaptive (or \"hijacking\") feature. I found it fascinating, though not profound. That said, I think some of the best philosophical work is just that.

That's an interesting point. I think there's also a cost to that-- philosophy lugs around a lot of pre-scientific baggage that is poorly specified but historically important. Free will comes to mind, especially within the Christian history of resolving the apparent contradiction of horrific natural/manmade evils existing in the face of an omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent god. There are of course other historical contexts to notions of free will. But when philosophers talk about any of these in places where laypeople here them, it seems like those historical contexts are gone and they end up strongly implying a general purpose free will that is neither well-specified or in some cases even coherent. It would be like a bunch of programmers debating \"functions,\" with one meaning functional programming, another meaning any programming language where functions are a first-class citizen, and yet another meaning the set of all keywords \"function\" or \"FUNCTION\" in any programming language in history.

Relativity overturned those Newtonian assumptions on which Kant depended, although he might say we nevertheless have to experience time as constant and space in three dimensions, regardless of how those things turn out to \"really\" work, since that's the only way we can do it. So it's no longer obvious that time and space are just given absolutely, and due to that, they no longer make for a comfortable starting point for philosophical assumptions. If nature itself is different, then we might not even be experiencing it that way in the first place. More tentatively, I think our advancing understanding of how brains and machines embody concepts, our understanding of the differences of biological creatures combined with new physics, is suggestive at a bare minimum that reality could be experienced differently, and/or that we can understand how we experience these things empirically with better knowledge about brains, instead of asserting that everything is governed at the outset by this or that philosophical assumption. reply mcguire 14 hours agorootparent\"Relativity overturned those Newtonian assumptions on which Kant depended, although he might say we nevertheless have to experience time as constant and space in three dimensions, regardless of how those things turn out to \"really\" work, since that's the only way we can do it.\" I think you are more wrong than right here. My understanding (informed by Onora O'neill, Dan Bonevac, and various Stanford Encyclopedia entries :-)) is that Kant does not specifically depend on Newtonian assumptions but that human perceptions have to be mediated by time and space. Instead of overturning Kant, relativity and QM put even more distance between what we, as mortal, physical beings, can perceive versus whatever is really going on in the world. Kant's project was to discover, given all of that, what anyone can say about things like ethics. He even goes so far to say that what he is trying to do is universal and he would like it to apply to other forms of intelligent beings. reply glenstein 13 hours agorootparent> is that Kant does not specifically depend on Newtonian assumptions but that human perceptions have to be mediated by time and space I understand the point about mediation, and I tried to speak to it directly in the portion you quoted. You are exactly right about the way Kant uses that in his argument. It's flexible enough that it can be understood as resilient, I think. I tried show how science can nevertheless speak to it in several ways. One is the convenient equivalence between Kant's necessary conditions and nature as we understood it at the time. That equivalence makes it easier to be comfortable positing time and space as we understand them as necessary conditions that are prior to nature. It would be harder (but not impossible!) to entertain if there was daylight between what we believed our faculties to be and what we believed the natural world to be, if what was \"necessary\" was something different than what we thought we experienced (such as, say, a singular loaf of unified spacetime). An implication of Kant's view, as I understood him, was that we should be ready to believe it's different anyway, but nevertheless, it's easier to swallow when it perfectly aligns with how we thing the world really is. Second, for a different way of stating a similar point, if time and space are non-newtonian in some important way, we may have to understand that that is what we experience in the first instance, and we would have to wrestle with the fact that our intuitions may attest to a variety of possible underlying necessary conditions. (Wittgenstein has been mentioned in this thread, so for a paraphrase of something he supposedly said, in reply to a student noting that it looks like the sun goes around the earth: \"What would it look like if the earth went around the sun?\" So it may be with the nature of our faculties.) Third, as we gain deeper understanding of brain functions of ourselves and other creatures, we may have inroads to how certain of our conscious experiences depend on conceptual abstractions or models. And if so, it transforms it into an open empirical question rather than one where we are simply stuck presuming necessary conditions. Kant might insist that that is all already through the lense of our faculties such as they are, but we, with more information, would be increasingly comfortable just not entertaining them as we get increasingly robust empirical understandings of conscious experience. None of these is a \"defeater\" argument by itself and there's a lot that can be talked about here of course, but I think given 21st century science, if Kant were trying to present his vision for the first time we might find it more challenging to reconcile with what we know of the natural world. reply dontupvoteme 13 hours agorootparentprev>Relativity overturned those Newtonian assumptions Only in *very* specific situations which are extremely extremely extremely unrelated and WELL out of both practical and theoretical bound to the human perception of reality.

Just because someone had the idea first, doesn't mean that work is the source of the idea going forward. I think it's pretty clear that Wittgenstein's truth tables are those that guided the development of computer science. >In a manuscript of 1893, in the context of his study of the truth-functional analysis of propositions and proofs and his continuing efforts at defining and understanding the nature of logical inference, and against the background of his mathematical work in matrix theory in algebra, Charles Peirce presented a truth table which displayed in matrix form the definition of his most fundamental connective, that of illation, which is equivalent to the truth-functional definition of material implication. Peirce’s matrix is exactly equivalent to that for material implication discovered by Shosky that is attributable to Bertrand Russell and has been dated as originating in 1912. Thus, Peirce’s table of 1893 may be considered to be the earliest known instance of a truth table device in the familiar form which is attributable to an identifiable author, and antedates not only the tables of Post, Wittgenstein, and Łukasiewicz of 1920-22, but Russell’s table of 1912 and also Peirce’s previously identified tables for trivalent logic tracable to 1902. PDF of Anellis's paper: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1108/1108.2429.pdf >But even if that conclusion is challenged, it is now clear that Russell understood and used the truth-table technique and the truth-table device. By 1910, Russell had already demonstrated a well-documented understanding of the truth-table technique in his work on Principia Mathematica. Now, it would seem that by 1912, and surely by 1914, Russell understood, and used, the truth-table device. Of course, the combination of logical conception and logical engineering by Russell in his use of truth tables is the culmination of work by Boole and Frege, who were closely studied by Russell. Wittgenstein and Post still deserve recognition for realizing the value and power of the truth-table device. But Russell also deserves some recognition on this topic, as part of this pantheon of logicians. >In this paper I have shown that neither the truth-table technique nor the truth-table device was \"invented\" by Wittgenstein or Post in 1921-22. The truth-table technique may originally be a product of Philo's mind, but it was clearly in use by Boole, Frege, and Whitehead and Russell. The truth-table device is found in use by Wittgenstein in 1912, perhaps with some collaboration from Russell. Russell used the truth-table technique at Harvard in 1914 and in London in 1918.

Computer science is the most recent, which came in large part from philosophy departments. Before that was psychology. Alchemy is exactly a framework-free type of empiricism. The point of philosophy, and philosophy that happens in other sciences, is that we live inside of a model, and we interact with that model, and change the model while we are doing empirical research using the rules of the model. This is a type of reflexive framework development, where metaphysical ideas become obvious physics as people propose changes to the standard model we use.

One can know some of the characteristics of preference utilitarianism as an ethical model, for example. But in this conversation, perhaps the most important gap is epistemology. You feel confident you know what knowledge is and isn't and how one can arrive at it -- did you arrive at that understanding by directly observing what is and is not knowledge in an objective external universe? What does it mean to know, or even for a belief to be \"justified\"? Since you brought up Kant, and then re-canted (rimshot), Kant had the analytic vs synthetic distinction on propositions, where synthetic propositions are those which depend on how their meaning relates to the world -- i.e. can be true or false depending on what's true about the world. Math, logic, etc are analytic truths; we don't validate that e.g. arithmetic works the way we know it does by doing \"experiments\" and \"empirical observations\" of operations with large cardinality sets of physical objects. reply lisper 15 hours agorootparent> Is it directly observable whether a belief is \"knowledge\", such that the efficacy of a method can be known by \"empirical observation\"?

What can I say? You are simply wrong about that. Ethics are instincts produced by evolution. Like all instincts, they exist because they have survival value: genes that build brains with instincts about ethics reproduce better (in certain environmental niches) than genes that don't. Ethics are every bit as amenable to scientific inquiry as any other natural phenomenon. > we don't validate that e.g. arithmetic works the way we know it does by doing \"experiments\" and \"empirical observations\" of operations with large cardinality sets of physical objects Of course we do, because there are different ways of doing arithmetic. Some of them are better models of the world than others, and so those are the ones that we tend to think of as \"the way\" of doing arithmetic. But the only thing that makes standard arithmetic special is that it corresponds to the way that (parts of) the world work. reply jll29 14 hours agorootparent> You are simply wrong about that. Ethics are instincts produced by evolution. Like all instincts, they exist because they have survival value That sounds like a rather cheap version of evolution (and - not wanting to offend you, but in my view you sound rather too convinced that you have figured it all out for your own good). The way you map moral values on survival smells like Skinner's cheap way to explain language in terms of behavioral stimulus-response pairs: not an adequate explanation.

Sure. Science is not a magic bullet. It can steer you astray. But in the long run it works better than any available alternative methodology. reply abeppu 15 hours agorootparentprev> Ethics are instincts produced by evolution. I would also clarify: We have instincts about ethics. This does not imply that ethics are instincts, any more than having instincts about geometry implies that geometry is instincts or having instincts about physical quantities implies that measure theory is instincts. reply abeppu 15 hours agorootparentprev> Just look around you. You have computers, GPS, mRNA vaccines, etc. etc. etc. Those things were not produced by philosophers. You're clearly not getting this. Yes, you can see the products of scientific progress. That's not the same as seeing the absence of knowledge produced by anyone else. And one would expect that truths revealed about the physical world we live in should of course be the ones that give rise to physical artifacts you can point at. > Ethics are instincts produced by evolution. ... and yet, our ethical beliefs are not biologically determined, but change as a function of culture, and at least in part through the work of philosophers. Our beliefs about the importance of freedom, equality, fairness (or what those mean) change dramatically over decades, far too quick for genetics to have any contribution to the change. Re arithmetic, \"the integers are closed under addition\" is still something one can know without making any observations of the world, even if standard addition were somehow not useful in making predictions about the physical world. Further, by arguing that the importance of mathematical knowledge is only its relationship to making predictions about physical reality, you are once again begging the question. reply lisper 15 hours agorootparent> That's not the same as seeing the absence of knowledge produced by anyone else.

A lot of your physical characteristics aren't biologically determined. That doesn't put them beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. > \"the integers are closed under addition\" is still something one can know without making any observations of the world Really?

Am I? What is it that made you decide to write \"the integers are closed under addition\" if not some prediction on the effect that writing those words rather than some other words (like, say, \"pandas are partial to purple parkas\") would have on physical reality? reply abeppu 14 hours agorootparent> But that's not what you asked, and it's not what I claimed. I didn't say that philosophy is entirely devoid of value, only that a lot of it is. You claimed you can empirically observe \"that the most effective method for expanding human knowledge is science\", which I think requires you to observe the efficacy of all methods of expanding human knowledge. Regarding ethics, empirically gathering what people's ethical opinions are is surveying. This is distinct from knowledge about ethical systems. For example, preference utilitarianism sets the stage for social choice theory, in which theorems tell us about the properties and weaknesses of systems for groups of agents to collectively make choices (Arrow's theorem, Harsanyi's theorem etc). > Really? How do you know what the word \"integer\" means without making any observations of the world?

It's possible that someone might invent a more effective method (but I believe there is actually good reason to believe that this is not possible, but that's a tangent). > preference utilitarianism sets the stage for social choice theory, in which theorems tell us about the properties and weaknesses of systems for groups of agents to collectively make choices (Arrow's theorem, Harsanyi's theorem etc). Sure. So? Arrow's theorem is a great example. It's a theorem. It's math. It's not what is generally done under the rubric of \"philosophy\". > this does not mean that true properties of addition are \"empirical\" truths proceeding from science Yes it does. What is the \"true\" value of (say) 11 + 27? It could be 38, but it could also be 1 (mod 12) or 13 (mod 24) any of which might be the \"true\" value depending on the application. reply card_zero 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, The demarcation problem is distinguishing science from non-science. Karl Popper theorizes that falsifiability is what makes the difference. But there's nothing falsifiable about that theory! What would you test? If you accept that there are meaningful theories outside of science, this works out fine. If you don't, you'll struggle to say what science is. reply mannykannot 13 hours agorootparentDefinitions are hardly a problem just for science (if they are a problem - science seems to doing OK regardless), and I feel they are particularly difficult for those with a strong commitment to the view that ethics must somehow be grounded in something irrefutably true. In fact, I vaguely suspect that Wittgenstein's later position with respect to the rule-following paradox was that seeking such grounding is a doomed pursuit, and he somewhat famously contended that philosophy was not concerned with problems, only linguistic puzzles. Perhaps rather paradoxically (at least if you see Popper as a champion of science over philosophy), Popper (who, in addition to his work on the philosophy of science, also wrote \"The Open Society and its Enemies\") felt that Wittgenstein was utterly wrong to deny that there are real philosophical problems. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#RuleFollPri... https://ditext.com/wordpress/2019/06/26/puzzles-vs-problems-... reply card_zero 12 hours agorootparentThank you, I knew there would be relevant Popper quotes about philosophy being meaningful, and I was trying the keyword \"transempirical\" without success.

Here's my guess: the same thing that causes them to not be able to juggle: a lack of practice (and in the case of philosophy: a teacher who isn't also hallucinating). As for why I consider such things important: I believe they are intimately related to why humans are continuously involved in wars and various other sub-optimal activities, which are easily[1] explained away with stories.

I'm tempted to head off to write a \"if philosophers were programming languages\" post now. reply CamperBob2 16 hours agorootparentWhat the heck, I've got more hacker karma than the Digital Dalai Lama. I'll take -4 for the team and ask the English language for its own interpretation [1]: \"In the high-stakes world of technology, where the choice of a programming language can either pave the way to efficiency or lead you into the depths of debugging hell, imagine if programming languages were as enigmatic and complex as the philosophers of yore. Here’s how I envision this quirky universe. Plato: HTML Plato’s ideal forms find their match in HTML. Much like Plato’s theory, where objects in the physical realm are mere shadows of their perfect forms, HTML is but the scaffolding of web content, giving structure but relying on the more material CSS and JavaScript to breathe life into its skeletal outlines. HTML, the philosopher of the web, contemplates the essence of web structure in a cave of its own making, illuminated by the flickering screens of web developers trying to decode the shadows of their CSS frameworks. Aristotle: Python Aristotle, known for his logic and systematic approach to the physical world, would be Python. Just as Aristotle classified flora and fauna, Python organizes data with lists, tuples, and dictionaries, making it ideal for developers who seek clarity and readability. Python’s philosophy is simple yet profound, mirroring Aristotle’s quest for understanding through empirical observation and not-so-metaphysical methods. Descartes: C++ \"I think, therefore I am,\" proclaimed Descartes, and so would any program written in C++. C++, with its complex syntax and powerful capabilities, reflects Descartes’ dualism. It can create almost metaphysical experiences in virtual realities but can also cause existential crises with its pointers and memory leaks, leading programmers to doubt everything, especially their choice of language. Nietzsche: Assembly Nietzsche, the philosopher of power, will to manifest, and the übermensch, resonates with Assembly language. Not for the faint-hearted, Assembly is for those who dare to manipulate the very fabric of hardware. Like Nietzsche’s writing, Assembly is tough to decipher, powerful in its capacity, and not commonly understood by the masses, often leaving one to ponder in solitude about the eternal recurrence of debugging sessions. Kant: Java Kant, who was all about rules and categorical imperatives, fits perfectly with Java. Java’s platform-independent mantra—write once, run anywhere—is a stern dictate akin to Kant’s moral imperatives. Both philosopher and language demand strict adherence to their defined structures and frameworks, leaving little room for moral or syntactic error. Sartre: JavaScript Existentialist par excellence, Sartre’s notion of existence precedes essence is the lived reality of every JavaScript framework. Just when you think you understand the essence of the JavaScript ecosystem, a new library or framework pops into existence, challenging the very core of your understanding. Sartre’s philosophy of radical freedom and existential angst mirrors the liberty and chaos of JavaScript’s untyped, loosely structured syntax. Hegel: Haskell Hegel’s dialectical method moves through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis, much like how Haskell approaches problems with its pure functional programming paradigm. It encourages developers to think in terms of transformations of data, often leading to a synthesis of solutions that are as elegant as they are abstract, reflective of Hegel’s complex philosophical constructs. In this whimsical world where philosophers are programming languages, choosing the right one could well depend on whether you prefer the existential dread of debugging Sartre's JavaScript at 3 AM or contemplating the Platonic forms of your HTML content. In either case, the philosophical underpinnings of your chosen language might just lead to as many questions about the nature of reality as lines of code.\" 1: https://chat.openai.com/share/584f78d7-6a9e-438d-ab87-02cebd... reply sdwr 15 hours agorootparentSartre and Hegel are pretty solid, the rest feel tenuous at best reply CamperBob2 15 hours agorootparentI don't know, pretty hard to argue with Nietzsche's pairing with assembly.

I've always been bad with names. reply andybak 17 hours agorootparentOK. Names aside I'm not sure how much you know about Wittgenstein. I'm far from an expert but - he did largely refute the Tractatus later in life but reasons that are probably the opposite of what you're implying. If anything his later works attempts to be less rigorous because he reached the conclusion that attempting rigour in language was deeply flawed. Like I said - I'm no expert and I've never read Wittgenstein first hand - but I do struggle when people casually dismiss the work of thousands of smart, sincere people over thousands of years. reply lisper 16 hours agorootparent> I'm not sure how much you know about Wittgenstein. Not much. But I don't have to know much to make my case here. All I have to do is point to the Tractatus, which really is manifest nonsense, and point out that publishing this bit of manifest nonsense didn't seem to hurt Wittgenstein's career much. Tractatus is not the only example of this sort of thing, just the one that sticks out in my mind as the most blatant. And this is not to say that Wittgenstein, or philosophy in general, never produced anything of value. But the problem is that to find the value you have to wade through all this horse shit, so it's so much more effort than it needs to be. A stopped clock is right twice a day. That doesn't mean there is any value in consulting it to find out what time it is. reply keiferski 16 hours agorootparentCalling something \"manifest nonsense\" while not understanding it, or even attempting to understand it, seems like a clear example of \"manifest nonsense\" to me. reply lisper 14 hours agorootparentYou apparently failed to note this sibling comment: > Wittgenstein himself states that the Tractatus is nonsense in its closing pages. > My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless... reply keiferski 14 hours agorootparentSenseless and nonsense are not the same thing, and if you had read the book, you’d understand this. reply steppi 15 hours agorootparentprevWittgenstein himself states that the Tractatus is nonsense in its closing pages. My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) I think you may agree with the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus more than you realize. My understanding is that his main goal at that time was to show that many of the classic problems of metaphysics which plagued philosophers for centuries or more are literally just nonsense. He didn't write the Tractatus to convince regular people though, but to convince academic philosophers of his time. He earned his fame by being somewhat successful. Rather than making a logical argument for his point, I understand his aim as stimulating his audience to think things out for themselves by offering them carefully crafted nonsense that gave a fresh perspective. I think you just have no use for the Tractatus because you're not preoccupied with metaphysical questions. reply mcguire 14 hours agorootparentprevYou do realize you are doing philosophy at this moment, right? reply lisper 14 hours agorootparentSure, but this is just a casual conversation. The problem is not with philosophy per se, the problem is with the academic field, which assigns (IMHO) outsized importance to undersized ideas. reply andybak 10 hours agorootparentChildren often ask questions such as \"Why is there something rather then nothing?\" or \"What happened before time?\".

What makes you think that these questions are beyond the scope of scientific inquiry? reply andybak 1 hour agorootparentIf science is tackling these questions then it's most likely doing so by making non-falsifiable claims. And at that point it's doing philosophy rather than science. And if you want to disagree with the definition of science that I'm using here then that's OK. But at that point, you're also doing philosophy. And all of this is fine because there's nothing wrong with doing philosophy. It's not just a word for \"the stuff I don't like\". reply samatman 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, as Kant put it: \"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent\". reply vehemenz 16 hours agorootparentprevWhen you say \"actually scientists\" and \"boundaries of human knowledge,\" you seem to be taking for granted naive views about metaphysical realism, scientific realism, and truth that are not trivial to defend, even for experienced philosophers. If you want to relegate philosophy to obfuscation and trivialities, a good starting place would be to demonstrate that you've made it past the undergraduate, foot stomping \"science\" phase that, honestly, not enough \"actual\" scientists seem to have made it past, bringing us mystical nonsense such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. reply lisper 16 hours agorootparent> you seem to be taking for granted naive views about metaphysical realism, scientific realism, and truth that are not trivial to defend, even for experienced philosophers. No, I'm not taking these things for granted.

Science works in ways that no other method does. > mystical nonsense such as the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics It's not mystical nonsense, it's a logical consequence of the mathematics of quantum mechanics.

What the many-worlds interpretation is, is philosophy. It's thinking about what could be that would be explanatory, in the absence of being able to test it; just as atomic theory was philosophy before it was experimentally shown... and it's still philosophy to think about what has actually been shown, since it was not long after it was \"shown\" that indivisible atoms became divisible into fundamental particles, that they in turn turned out not to be fundamental either. reply vehemenz 10 hours agorootparentTo be clear, I never suggested the many-worlds interpretation isn't philosophy, but I still think it's mystical nonsense (as most indulgent metaphysical speculation is). reply dragonwriter 15 hours agorootparentprev> It's not mystical nonsense, it's a logical consequence of the mathematics of quantum mechanics.

Most people would agree that the sun emits light in all directions, but there is no way to prove it with concrete evidence. The only thing you can prove with concrete evidence is that the sun emits light in the direction of objects in our solar system that we can see. We infer that the sun emits light in all directions because that is the best explanation that accounts for the data that we have. Many-worlds is the same. We can't demonstrate their existence, we infer it from the current-best explanation that accounts for the data that we have. reply mcguire 15 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that the best current interpretation of quantum mechanics is that there is no interpretation and that you just have to do the math. reply lisper 14 hours agorootparentYes, that's right. But if you want to assign any meaning to the math, and in particular if you want to adopt an ontology where you exist, then the math leaves you no alternative than to conclude that parallel universes also exist (unless you resort to special pleading like the Copenhagen interpretation). reply vehemenz 10 hours agorootparentprevI mean, just doing the math and being agnostic about the strengths of different interpretations seems to be an interpretation. Maybe it's more of an epistemic position than a metaphysical one, but it still kinda counts. reply AnimalMuppet 15 hours agorootparentprev> current-best explanation Many-worlds is by far not accepted to be the \"current-best explanation\". It's a candidate. It's not clear it's right. reply lisper 15 hours agorootparentSorry, I wasn't clear. The current-best explanation is not many worlds, it's the mathematical formalism of QM. Many-worlds is a logical consequence of that. reply AnimalMuppet 12 hours agorootparentMany worlds is one possible interpretation of the logical consequences of that. It's not nearly as definite or clear-cut as you're making it sound. reply lisper 12 hours agorootparentIt seems pretty clear cut to me.

The first half of his career, centered on the Tractatus, even today is regarded as more or less on the right track as relates to how we use language to make the kinds of propositions found in the natural sciences (see modern philosopher A.C. Grayling's intro to his book where he says as much), but is less than a comprehensive view of the totality of meaning that it originally aspired to be. And if anything, his latter career would be more pertinent, not less, as he spent it perhaps as the 20th century's most powerful advocate for the idea that philosophy spends too much time uselessly bewitching people with language. He was literally an engineering bro frustrated with pointless vagaries, known for flying into rages against what he regarded as frivolous philosophical nonsense. He might be the one guy from the 20th century who would most agree with you about the excesses of pointless language. reply xpe 12 hours agorootparentprevLet’s make this testable. Tell me what percentage of technical people, defined however you like, generally view philosophy as a waste of time. (This could even be a thought experiment for now.) Of these people how many of them come to their conclusion based on careful reasoning? Based on broad knowledge of philosophy? My prior expectation would be that these numbers are very low. I would expect that people who dismiss philosophy do so from a position of relative ignorance. This is not blame; the broader context matters: educational curricula, teaching quality, life experience, curiosity, competing interests, etc. Let’s put the shoe on the other foot. How much applied computer science is worth reading? If you put a typical example of it in front of me (the code professionals write for example), I’m probably going think it is a hot mess. It becomes more bearable if I interpret it as a sequence of economically and culturally constrained suboptimal decisions. The same goes for philosophy. reply lisper 12 hours agorootparent> I would expect that people who dismiss philosophy do so from a position of relative ignorance. That's entirely possible. It's even possible that my assessment is based on ignorance. I am certainly not an expert in the philosophical literature, and even more certainly not an expert in it recently. The last time I looked seriously at the philosophical literature at all was decades ago and maybe things have changed. But I am an expert in science, and computer science in particular (I have a Ph.D.) and so I can say with some authority that the philosophy literature that I looked at back in the day exhibited a profound ignorance of basic results in CS and math, and also a pretty profound lack of common sense. I found a lot of papers that were tackling non-problems that were based on false assumptions, the moral equivalent of fake proofs that 1=0 where the object of the game is to spot the flaw in the reasoning. And spotting the flaw in the reasoning wasn't even challenging. It was just obvious. It also seems to me that a lot of what is nowadays called philosophy is just pretty transparent cover for religious apologetics. Now, as you say, I could be wrong. I'm not an expert. If I'm wrong, I welcome being enlightened. But if you want to take that on I think you will find that I am not completely clueless. I suggest you start with citing an example other than Dennett or Maudlin of someone you think is doing good work in philosophy nowadays. reply BlueTemplar 1 hour agorootparentShouldn't you be aware that mathematics and computer \"science\" are closer to philosophy than actual (empirical) sciences ? Yours sounds more like the now very tired \"two cultures\" argument, sounds like you are discussing more the sociology side of things than anything ? (Would you throw out the baby of science with the bathwater of non-replicating papers ?) And wasn't Wittgenstein (et al.) the one that specifically recentered philosophy around the questions of language, trying to prune the accumulated historical bullshit that philosophy has a much harder difficulty to get rid of than (empirical) sciences ? reply klodolph 17 hours agorootparentprevCould you elaborate on how Kant does work that seems to be little more than the obfuscation of trivial or false ideas? reply lisper 17 hours agorootparentSorry, I made a mistake. I meant Wittgenstein, not Kant, who wrote one of the premier works of philosophical nonsense: the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus [1]. I believe that Wittgenstein himself once admitted that it was basically intended to be a practical joke kind of like the Sokal affair [2], but I can't find the reference right now. But some people seem to still take it seriously. The biggest problem in classical philosophy is that there were fundamental things they simply didn't know. In particular, anything written before 1936 doesn't have the benefit of Turing's results on universal computation, and so it suffers from all kinds of misconceptions about human exceptionalism. These mistakes are understandable, but nonetheless the products of ignorance, and should be of little more than historical interest today. But AFAICT contemporary philosophers still take them seriously. [1] https://www.wittgensteinproject.org/w/index.php?title=Tracta... [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair reply raddan 17 hours agorootparentI would love to see a reference to the claim that Wittgenstein regarded Tractatus as a joke. I took an analytic philosophy course as an undergrad that featured Wittgenstein prominently, and that prof certainly did not regard it unseriously. Anyone whose job it is to uncover the truth ought to be ant least a little curious about what we know and how we know it, and perhaps more importantly, whether there are true things that we can never know. These are mostly not scientific questions, but thinking about them helps us understand why science settled on the particular set of axioms that it did (eg, that there really is a world that exists independently of humans and their conception of it). reply lisper 16 hours agorootparent> I would love to see a reference to the claim that Wittgenstein regarded Tractatus as a joke. Apparently I was wrong about that too. According to another comment in this thread [1], he disavowed the work later, but intended it to be serious when he wrote it. It has always seemed like self-evident nonsense to me though. [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40089100 reply d0odk 17 hours agorootparentprevSomeone who is discrediting all of philosophy shouldn't confuse Wittgenstein and Kant. Further, Wittgenstein disavowed Tractatus as a failed project and completely revised his approach to philosophy. His most important and influential works came afterwards. reply glenstein 16 hours agorootparentHe disavowed is as comprehensive account of linguistic meaning, but I don't think he regarded it as false or meaningless, only that the full breadth of ways language conveyed meaning was wider than the account given in Tractatus. reply lisper 16 hours agorootparentprev> Someone who is discrediting all of philosophy shouldn't confuse Wittgenstein and Kant. Getting the names confused is not the same as getting the people confused. My poster child for philosophical nonsense has always been the Tractatus. I just somehow got it into my head that it was written by Kant, not Wittgenstein (I've always been bad at remembering names) and I didn't bother to check because I was writing an HN comment and not a paper for publication. reply d0odk 16 hours agorootparentOkay, but you initially criticized Wittgenstein, the philosopher, not Tractatus, the work. Wittgenstein himself would agree that Tractatus is deeply flawed. He wrote his more influential works later, and they went in a completely different philosophical direction. You're criticizing a philosopher as \"pooh-pooh-able\" for a work that he personally disavowed and does not represent the positions he is best known for. reply lisper 16 hours agorootparentI was intending to criticize the field, and in a shot-from-the-hip in a moment of some passion chose Wittgenstein as my example. > Wittgenstein himself would agree that Tractatus is deeply flawed. So I am vindicated. I'm not actually criticizing Wittgenstein for writing Tractatus; there's nothing wrong with writing nonsense. Lewis Carroll was a master. The problem is writing nonsense and not recognizing it as nonsense. I'm criticizing the field of philosophy for elevating Wittgenstein to iconic status after having written such manifest nonsense without recognizing that it is manifest nonsense. That is an indictment of the field, not the man. BTW, the reason that this is a touchy subject with me is that I did my masters thesis (in 1987) on the subject of intentionality [1] in AI. After wading through dozens of inscrutible papers I came to realize that the whole topic was basically bullshit [2], and that the problem had been completely solved by Bertrand Russell in 1905 [3], but no one seemed to have noticed. Even today the vast majority of philosophers (AFAIK) think this is still an open topic. And BTW, Russell's solution is beautiful and easy to understand. Frankly, I think it has been ignored because it is easy to understand.

He considered it dogmatic, but not nonsensical by any stretch. reply d0odk 13 hours agorootparentMy gripe is that the commenter above cites early Wittgenstein as an example of the failure of philosophy as a whole, while ignoring (or perhaps being unaware) that later Wittgenstein is what is philosophical \"canon\". I'll concede there is some debate about how Wittgenstein's views evolved over his life and the extent to which he repudiated his earlier work. But I think you're going a bit far by characterizing what I said as \"confidently wrong history,\" if that's directed at what I wrote. reply glenstein 6 hours agorootparentI'm actually quite agreeable to idea the that much of philosophy is incoherent nonsense. I would have completely gone to bat for this commenter if they said Heidegger was such an example. Or Searle for that matter. I can even see the case for Kant. And they all have their defenders, just not me. But even for someone as sympathetic to that argument as I am, I don't see any version of Wittgenstein's reflections on the Tractatus as agreeing it to be nonsense much less a paradigmatic example of it. It's not just a matter of the later Wittgenstein being the \"good\" stuff. The Tractatus built on the work of Frege and was incredibly dense in its logical expressions, and half the challenge is keeping up with him, because he did philosophy from the perspective of an engineer, knowledgeable in logical and mathematical notation. It's one of the essential works of philosophy from the 20th century. reply Vecr 9 hours agorootparentprevDo you still have your master's thesis? reply lisper 9 hours agorootparenthttps://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/1d7...

Late Wittgenstein is Philosophical Investigations. There are also good texts on philosophy of language that excerpt from the major authors (including Wittgenstein) without requiring you to read the entirety of their books. reply lisper 11 hours agorootparentNope, not a joke. Just the same mistake I made originally. I guess I have conflated Kant and Wittgenstein in my mind even more thoroughly than I thought. My bad. I've gotten pretty overwhelmed with all the activity in this thread, and I'm trying to get some actual work done in between responses so I'm a little distracted. reply vehemenz 17 hours agorootparentprevI think your critique of philosophy would land better if you picked an easier target. The primary metaphor of the Tractatus (pulling up the ladder) often goes over people's heads. reply dsubburam 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you make of Wittgenstein's \"no private language\" argument?[1] I am not a professional philosopher, but I understand that that argument is offered as proof that \"language is essentially social\" (see article cited below), and so of some import. [1] https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/private-language/ reply lisper 17 hours agorootparentHe's not wrong, but the right way to make this argument is in terms of Shannon's information theory. You don't need to resort to philosophical mumbo jumbo, as Wittgenstein did. And Wittgenstein actually had no excuse because Shannon published while Wittgenstein was still alive. This is the difference between the Wittgensteins and the Dennetts and Maudlins of the world. Wittgenstein just seems to be profoundly ignorant of science and how it applies to philosophical questions, while Dennett and Maudlin are really scientists first and philosophers second. Their work is chock full of references to actual scientific studies. Maudlin probably knows more about quantum physics than many physicists. reply glenstein 15 hours agorootparent>Wittgenstein just seems to be profoundly ignorant of science and how it applies to philosophical questions ??? If anything his criticism of his own work was that it was excessively represented language as being the kind of language used by the natural sciences, which was a narrow slice of the full breadth of possible ways language can be used to convey meaning. The very thing that makes his career so fascinating is that he was purely an engineering bro, who cared more about math and logic, and he brought that perspective into philosophy, and challenged philosophy as being nonsense when measured against the standards of the hard sciences. That's essentially what the Tractatus is, and also the reason why it was retrospectively regarded as dogmatic. Shannon's information theory is brilliant, but born out of an interest in formalisms related information transmission, and while it can be treated like it's in conversation with theories of semantic meaning, I don't think it was ever considered a specific repudiation of any particular approach. There was a whole century's worth of \"ordinary language\" philosophy in the anglo world guilty of much graver offenses in regarding uncritical assumptions about ordinary language as some kind of conceptual or informational bedrock, and the ways you apply Shannon to any of that, while I think you can, are non-obvious. > And Wittgenstein actually had no excuse because Shannon published while Wittgenstein was still alive. Tractatus came out something like 20 years before information theory, and by the time it was published he had already taken his late career \"turn\" to self criticism, but again, I don't think anyone treated Shannon like it was any specific commentary on his philosophy, the topics are rather remote and while they can \"speak to\" one another in a sense, a lot depends on how you build out your conceptual bridge between the two topics. reply wizzwizz4 16 hours agorootparentprevInformation-theoretical arguments are powerful, but they're not the only worthwhile approaches. You can't use an information-theoretic argument to teach someone information theory, and they'll find it easier to grok the consequences of information theory if they have other concepts to relate it to. Having multiple different routes to a given understanding is useful. Wittgenstein was studying the nature of language, something closer to mathematics than to physics. And he came up with these ideas no later than 1933: Shannon only published his work on information theory in 1948. That Wittgenstein's later work was validated by advances in science over a decade later suggests that \"philosophical mumbo jumbo\" does not characterise it well. Indeed, perhaps there's something to learn from it. reply pdonis 17 hours agorootparentprev> I meant Wittgenstein, not Kant I think Kant would have been another justifiable example. I found Bertrand Russell's commentary on Kant to be apt: \"Hume, with his criticism of the concept of causality, awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers--so at least he says, but the awakening was only temporary, and he soon invented a soporific which enabled him to sleep again.\" reply lisper 17 hours agorootparent> I think Kant would have been another justifiable example.

The recall caps a tumultuous week for Tesla. The company laid off more than 10% of its workforce on Monday, and lost two of its highest-ranking executives. A few days later, Tesla asked shareholders to re-vote on CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation package that was struck down by a judge earlier this year. Reports of problems with the Cybertruck’s accelerator pedal started popping up in the last few weeks. Tesla even reportedly paused deliveries of the truck while it sorted out the issue. Musk said in a post on X that Tesla was “being very cautious” and the company reported to NHTSA that it was not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the problem. The company has now confirmed to NHTSA that the pedal can dislodge, making it possible for it to slide up and get caught in the trim around the footwell. Tesla said it first received a notice of one of these accelerator pedal incidents from a customer on March 31, and then a second one on April 3. After performing a series of tests, it decided on April 12 to issue a recall after determining that “[a]n unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,” and that “[r]esidual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.” Tesla says it will replace or rework the accelerator pedal on all existing Cybertrucks. It also told NHTSA that it has started building Cybertrucks with a new accelerator pedal, and that it’s fixing the vehicles that are in transit or sitting at delivery centers. While the Cybertruck only first started shipping late last year, this is not the vehicle’s first recall. But the initial one was minor: Earlier this year, Tesla recalled the software on all of its vehicles because the font sizes of its warning lights were too small. The company unveiled the truck back in 2019.

After performing a series of tests, it decided on April 12 to issue a recall after determining that an “[a]n unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,” and that “[r]esidual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.” How do you have so little quality control and insight into your manufacturing process that someone on your own production line can introduce a new step to your truck manufacturing process that no one noticed? I guess when analysts said the incumbent auto manufacturers would have a large advantage over Tesla in manufacturing, this is what they meant? Because this looks like a very unprofessional error to have made for a company that has done well up until now. reply ChuckMcM 17 hours agoparentI don't think it is an unprofessional error, there are many reasons that changes get introduced on the manufacturing line which benefit production speed and/or reduce errors. What they missed was the after action surveillance and analysis. In a different organization such a change would go in, and at the same time kick off an engineering investigation to verify that it doesn't make anything worse. If that analysis comes up clean, there is no change. If it finds a problem though, then the change is reverted/changed to something else. In regular car companies you see things like \"We're recalling all cars between VINxxxx and VINyyyy\" which basically delineate that time between when the change was made and the time the analysis suggesting it wasn't a good thing. If its a minor thing there won't be a recall, just a bit of extra \"warranty work\" at the next service opportunity which the dealer does. reply ChuckMcM 16 hours agorootparentAs a followup to this, in this Techcrunch article[1] it says that all 3,878 Cybertrucks shipped to date have been recalled. That isn't a lot of cars. Apart from what it says about sales of the Cybertruck, that suggests they haven't had enough customer miles on these things yet to flesh out the more subtle issues. [1] https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/19/tesla-cybertruck-throttle-... reply slowhadoken 14 hours agorootparentAlso isn’t a recall is a good thing for consumers? It means Tesla is fixing an error, not ignoring it. reply ChuckMcM 14 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, its good they are proactively fixing things, this particular issue with uncontrolled acceleration was particularly dangerous. In the US, consumer liability laws make these fixes mandatory but it is always better when a manufacturer voluntarily recalls a product than when it is ordered to by some oversight agency. reply ilovetux 13 hours agorootparentWould this not classify as reactive since it is happening 3 weeks after hearing about it from a customer? reply filoleg 12 hours agorootparentProactive, in this case, means “before they are legally required to.” If they waited until NHTSA performed their investigation and made a recall request (which is how the heavy majority of the recalls in the US are performed), that would be reactive. reply chrisjj 25 minutes agorootparent> Proactive, in this case, means “before they are legally required to.” Actually not. \"creating or controlling a situation rather than just responding to it after it has happened.\" reply sonicanatidae 11 hours agorootparentprevYes and no. Yes, because recalls are a good thing, because the manuf. has acknowledged the issue and is trying to address it. No, because what glue sniffing idiot thought glue would be the best option, instead of just riveting the damn thing down, and never worrying about the pretty little piece of garbage coming loose and sticking the accel pedal down. reply bennyhill 13 hours agorootparentprevSeems pretty scary to me that the supposed error causing uncontrolled acceleration is a little soap near interior matts. I guess I've been called a pig for not being extremely reckless with the cars I've owned. reply wongarsu 13 hours agorootparentSoap in the glue joint between the accelerator pedal and its cover. You won't cause this by cleaning your car with soap reply rcpt 13 hours agorootparentprevYes I would love it if Honda would admit that the transmission on the Odyssey is bonkers but seems like they'll claim it's WAI until a lawsuit happens reply KennyBlanken 14 hours agorootparentprevFor a halo vehicle that's typical volume. There are numerous car companies with those sorts of sales numbers on a particular model and they don't have these issues, mostly because they aren't stupid enough to make their own stuff. Rolls Royce doesn't make their own gas pedal; they go to a company that makes them. Nearly every problem Tesla has can be attributed to Musk's insistence that he knows better than an industry that is extremely cutthroat and has learned lessons from a century of being in business. He has been propped up by customers and VCs who think that means the auto industry is \"stodgy\", when really they didn't understand all the reasons things are done the way they are. It's like the fresh college grad who comes onto the SW eng team having made some clever app while he was a sophomore...and says \"oh you're doing it all wrong\" to senior engineers. One major mistake Musk made is confusing \"big five\" (GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, VAG) ambivalence toward electric cars with incompetence. In Ford's case that is fairly accurate - the Mach E is an engineering embarrassment, the Lightning less so, probably because there is enormous organizational pressure to not fuck up in the product line that is their bread and butter. VAG has demonstrated great competency at EVs (Porsche and Audi mostly) at the high end of the market...and once GM really gets its Ultium platform going, Tesla is well and truly fucked if they intend to keep making cars instead of just shifting to being an 'electric gas station' company...but they're on their heels there too, having slept while CCS surpassed their charging standard years ago. reply ethbr1 13 hours agorootparentI don't think anyone thinks traditional auto is incompetent at manufacturing. I think lots of people have their doubts about the strategic product vision of big auto executives, who traditionally have tactically chased short-term profit margins with tunnel vision that would make GE cringe. reply ajross 13 hours agorootparentprev> There are numerous car companies with those sorts of sales numbers on a particular model and they don't have these issues Recalls are absolutely routine in this industry, though. This sounds like a semantic argument hiding behind \"these issues\" as being somehow different from \"those\" issues? reply Sohcahtoa82 15 hours agorootparentprev> Apart from what it says about sales of the Cybertruck, What? It says nothing about Cybertruck sales and everything about how slow they've been to ramp up production. Tesla has a well-known history of being slow to put a new model into production. I find it odd that you would assume less than 4,000 Cybertrucks have been sold because of lack of interest. reply asadotzler 10 hours agorootparentMusk said last November they had capacity then for 125,000 trucks a year. Are you saying he lied to us? reply tw04 9 hours agorootparentprev> What they missed was the after action surveillance and analysis. Isn’t that literally an unprofessional error? The big three already have this as standard operating procedure. Tesla still seems to be treating building cars like devops: move fast and break things, but don’t worry about the break things part until it’s bad enough that end users start complaining in a public forum. reply chrisjj 29 minutes agorootparentprev> I don't think it is an unprofessional error, there are many reasons that changes get introduced on the manufacturing line which benefit production speed and/or reduce errors. I think you missed \"unapproved\". reply 11thEarlOfMar 17 hours agorootparentprevMoreover, from what I've seen, this is an isolated manufacturing escape. Given the perspective of the rapid growth in capacity, with 3 factories coming online in 5 years and 2 million+ total capacity, wouldn't we expect to see more escapes, even from a top performing auto company? reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparentIf rapid expansion is resulting in an increase in defects, whatever the cause, then the expansion itself is far too rapid and needs to be considered a fault. reply ChuckMcM 17 hours agorootparentI'd agree with this. I was at Intel early on and as they expanded they were very careful about exactly replicating fabs because they didn't want an increase in defects. For most (all?) manufacturers bringing a new factory online that didn't produce exactly the same level of quality would be red flag to re-evaluate how they brought on new capacity. reply valianteffort 17 hours agorootparentprevDefects are inherent to anything involving human labor. You can't expect workers on 12hr shifts to have consistent high quality of throughput. It has nothing to do with expansion and more to do with people just getting lazy or negligent throughout the day. reply Draiken 16 hours agorootparent> You can't expect workers on 12hr shifts to have consistent high quality of throughput. Nor should we. We should expect the company to prioritize safety and hire more people to avoid such mistakes. Or even if you want to keep that awful 12h shift practice, at the very least have good procedures and quality control to ensure failures from those \"lazy\" workers don't leave the factory. reply FloatArtifact 8 hours agorootparentUmm manufacturing, think of healthcare. It's not uncommon for inpatient nursing to do 12-hour shifts and doctors do seven of days/nights of 12-hour shifts. reply FiberBundle 16 hours agorootparentprevMaybe not let people work 12 hour shifts? This isn't the 19th century. reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparentSome people like 12 hour shifts? You make more money and your commuting expense per hour of work goes down. The alternative is that someone who wants to make more money takes a second job somewhere else. Then they're working 16 hours a day and have two commutes. What does 16 hours of work and 6 hours of sleep do for quality? reply asa400 14 hours agorootparentA bunch of people think they're good at working 12 hour shifts. Almost none of them are. There is an absolute mountain of fatigue research that bears this out. Truck drivers and pilots are legally prohibited from working more than a certain amount of hours in a given period because if their performance suffers, people die. Personally, I'd prefer the same apply to whoever happens to be installing the accelerator pedal on my car. Sure, you can let people work as many hours as they possibly want, you're just making a decision that someone other than those workers and the companies that employ them is going to pay the externalities for all of their quality deficiencies. We have hour restrictions because people can't consent to being killed by a tired truck driver. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparent> There is an absolute mountain of fatigue research that bears this out. Any kind of sound research is going to conclude that a physically fit and healthy person has more endurance than a sickly and out of shape person. The former can work more hours than the latter in actual fact. > Truck drivers and pilots are legally prohibited from working more than a certain amount of hours in a given period because if their performance suffers, people die. Truck drivers and pilots are legally prohibited from working more than a certain number of hours because some of them are sickly and out of shape, if those ones were to work 12 hour shifts then people would die, and that provides a convenient excuse for their lobbyists to demand rules that reduce the labor supply. reply asa400 13 hours agorootparentIt's a truism to say healthy people are healthier than unhealthy people. Of course they are. The point isn't that healthy people can work more than unhealthy people, it's that all people - even healthy people, even young people, even experts - have a much lower tolerance for stress and fatigue than they think they do, and their performance at the limit degrades quickly. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThe issue is that the limit is in a different place for different people. One person's performance is degraded by hour 6 as much as another's is by hour 10, so it makes no sense to limit them both to 8 hours -- the first presumably shouldn't even be working 6. There is also the question of where to stop. Suppose that the average person's performance is degraded by 5% after 4 hours. Should everyone stop after 4 hours then? They're not at peak performance anymore. But 95% is often good enough. And maybe 90% is good enough. Maybe 80% is good enough. Maybe 75% is good enough and one person is at 75% after 8 hours. Maybe only 90% is good enough but it's a different kind of work and then the same person is still at 90% after 14 hours. Maybe you're at 85% after 8 hours but get back to 90% with a cup of coffee. There is no one size fits all. reply gopher_space 14 hours agorootparentprevHave you ever worked a 12 hour shift? Ever worked 4 10s? You know how you’re mentally checked out of a job after 4 to 6 hours? That doesn’t get better after 8. A 12 hour shift means you’re in a bit of a mental fog half the day. reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentIt depends what kind of work it is, and what kind of shape you're in.

If you're making e.g. textiles, and being tired means you occasionally produce something that gets tossed out by quality control, this is not obviously a danger to anyone so it's just a cost trade off in wasted material vs. benefits of operating the factory for longer hours. Many types of emergency response or on-call work. You just got off an 8 hour shift when an emergency happens. The cost of mistakes you make from being tired can be less than the cost of waiting 16 hours before responding to the emergency or leaving it to someone unqualified. Generically anything where the cost of occasional mistakes is low or they can be detected before they have a major impact. But also, the point is that different people have different levels of endurance.

You can't change the market rate for that kind of labor by magic; employers are operating in a competitive market. You can get more money by working more hours. reply jjav 14 hours agorootparent> employers are operating in a competitive market Let's see; Musk is demanding that the board give him a 56B pay package. Tesla seems to have about 130K employees. They could afford to give every employee a 400K raise and Musk still gets a fortune from the left over money. So money doesn't seem to be very tight there, it's just that greed demands that a single person gets it all. reply FiberBundle 13 hours agorootparentThe shareholders would pay for Musk's pay package by having their shares diluted. It's not as if Tesla has to provide any money for that, so it's not really comparable to giving employees a raise. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparentMoney is money. In theory they could dilute the shareholders by issuing new shares into the market and use the money to pay employees more. But this fails to identify what magic is to be used to cause them to want to do that. Employers (and employees) generally have a pretty good idea what the market price is for a particular job. If they have to fill 100 positions and offering $25/hour causes them to get 100 qualified applicants who accept the position, they could offer $35/hour, but this is like saying that the employees could accept $15/hour when another employer is offering $25. Some explanation is required for why they would. reply jjav 12 hours agorootparentprev> so it's not really comparable to giving employees a raise Employees can (and most often are) paid in those company shares as well, so no difference. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentprevTesla is a public company. If the board doesn't think Elon Musk is worth that amount of money, they don't have to pay it to him, and have the incentive not to -- the shareholders would get to keep the money instead. But maybe he is worth that amount of money; he's a one-man marketing machine and owns a major social media company that can influence the public perception of the company. That could very well be worth that amount of money to the company over a period of years -- and it isn't a single year's compensation. So then we're back to it being a competitive market. If the company gets e.g. $60B in value from having Elon Musk, and he knows this and demands $56B, the company can either pay the market price or have a net loss of $4B relative to the alternative. And then have even less money to pay employees. Or maybe he isn't worth that much and if the shareholders give it to him then it's costing the company money. But then that's maladaptive and the company will lose business to some other company that pays its executives less and uses the money to lower the price of their cars and gain a competitive advantage while still paying the market rate for other types of labor. Either way it doesn't change the market price for those other types of labor, which are much easier to estimate than the value of certain unusual executives. reply jjav 11 hours agorootparent> If the board doesn't think Elon Musk is worth that amount of money, they don't have to pay it to him Well, if you're following that drama, that is how it is supposed to work and how the Delaware judge said it needs to work. So, now Musk just want to move the incorporation to TX, where he can order the board to pay him whatever he wants without oversight. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparentThe compensation package was approved by the shareholders, not just the board, but then the judge didn't like the disclosures for the shareholder vote and invalidated it. Musk obviously didn't like that and is now behaving in the usual way, but whatever. He's going to put it up for another vote and the shareholders are going to approve it again or they won't. reply jajko 16 hours agorootparentprevBut we talk about Musk, who is absolutely clear how he views workers and at this point we know how he treats them too (and himself, which is a textbook example of unhealthy obsessive behavior among other unhealthy stuff coming from high performing broken mind).

The workaround shouldn't have happened, but is only one of countless ways this would have inevitably happened anyway. Glue has a lot of failure modes. Correct application can't be reliably tested non-destructively. Product variances are often very hard to detect. Degradation with age and physical use can't be reliably forecast. Three pins on the back of that appearance plate that push into starlock style fasteners in the pedal are cheaper than the appropriate glue, faster to install than glue, more reliable, trivially verified, impossible to misalign, and that's why it's a common solution that auto manufacturers use in this exact application.

Troubleshoot and find brakes not releasing. further troubleshoot and find it is due to pressure not getting to brakes(configuration is such that brakes come on if there is loss of hydraulic pressure). Replace hydraulic line, machine is working. Remove contaminate from line, no one know what it is. Assembly pointing fingers and saying sabotage. I walk around the assembly area, I find that paint decided to use packing peanuts to mask holes that the hydraulic fitting go in instead of masking tape as directed.

We could have fixed this, but if you do not say anything it might be a while before someone on the dev team notices.\" reply JohnFen 17 hours agorootparentI think that devs often underestimate just how difficult it is for users to report problems. The most common problems are that the users feel ignored, like they're being a burden on the devs, or scolded (for not reporting it correctly, for \"not holding it right\", etc.). It's even common for there not to be an easy way to report such problems (\"use Discord\", \"sign up for an account on this website and report there\", etc.) Even as a dev, I resist doing it because of how unpleasant it can be. If I can come up with a workaround without having to report the issue, that's what I'll tend to do. And if I have to talk to tech support rather than the devs? That's simply not going to happen unless I'm trapped into using the product. We still haven't cracked this problem as an industry. reply rurp 16 hours agorootparentTo make things worse the largest consumer tech companies, like Google and Apple, have a well deserved reputation for caring very little about customer feedback. It's a normal thing to lookup how to fix an annoyance or regression, finding hundreds of people posting about the same complaint, without ever getting any sort of response or reaction from the company. Heck the only support Google offers for many products is a community forum that their own employees never post on, and I assume few even look at.

This is a Support task, not a Dev task. Support should be working the tickets and reporting unsolvable issues with the code, so the Devs can address. You've been dealing with bad support teams, because your experience is not how support is supposed to work. Also, we Ops folks truly appreciate undocumented work arounds by the Devs. We love spending hours pouring over a given system, trying 107 different versions of some framework, causing lots of downtime, and working nights/weekends, just to learn that some UNDOCUMENTED cludge fucking bullshit is what's actually causing the issue.

With open source, you're usually reporting to devs. With commercial software, usually to tech support or to nobody. > You've been dealing with bad support teams, because your experience is not how support is supposed to work. Yes, I know -- but it is how the majority of support actually is, if there is even support available at all. In a whole lot of cases, there is none. I'm talking about software meant for consumer use. Software for business use is much better on these issues, although you still do find them.

Then you'll get a report 6 months later that \"[big critically important feature] is not working\" and you'll look into it and support has adopted a process that essentially disables that feature or they have a workaround for a bug that was fixed 4 years ago and because they never entered the conversation at that time they still do the workaround. We had a big kerfluffle around our OTA update system at one point because they did a big round of updates and \"none of them worked.\" And then I dug into the system logs for each of those components and 95% of what they claimed didn't work actually did. But meanwhile you've got product managers and other people wading into the conversation to try to tell you to fix something that isn't actually the problem. We're never truly going to get away from this until we stop excluding people from the conversation about product problems. I'm just sitting here hoping we adopt a quality management system of some sort before the company's product implodes. reply JohnMakin 16 hours agorootparentThere was a poorly implemented customer support system that I worked with once that due to the way the app worked, support could run a query that would essentially scan the entire database, predictably it'd hit a proxy timeout. So what happened instead was they would open 10+ tabs doing the exact same query hoping one would get lucky and succeed, and we had to figure out why our database was getting ddos'd. Trying to explain that they were actually making the issue worse with the workaround was very painful, saying stuff like \"well what did you change, it was working fine for months.\" reply IshKebab 17 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried thinking of the reasons? I can think of several: * There's probably a small chance it actually would get fixed, and therefore a decent probability that reporting it would be a waste of their time. * They needed a solution sooner than reporting it and waiting for fix to maybe eventually appear. Once the workaround was in place there was no need for a fix. * Sometimes the people running projects you use can be hostile, which makes reporting stuff very unappealing and even stressful. Much better to avoid interacting with them if at all possible. * They didn't know who to report it to, or how to report it. * They simply didn't have time to report it. reply 77pt77 14 hours agorootparentprev> Why did you not just mention this was not working right and you are working around it?

We zero in on situations like that and pretend that it's the worker's fault for making the wrong call, but we ignore that if they didn't make the right calls a thousand times before, nothing would ever get done. In this case, if pedal cover is a friction fit and can slide off and get jammed in between panels, this doesn't sound like an assembly mistake but a pretty major design error, right?

Plastics are extremely highly-engineered and well-understood (which is why they're everywhere now). Wood can be the same, but by default is not, especially in mass-production contexts where performance can vary dramatically between individual pieces of wood, which is one of many reasons you don't see it used in these contexts.

No single person on the production line should have the ability to make unauthorized changes to the procedures being used in production.

Soap is a common method for getting rubber pads onto metal pedals in the aftermarket world. Dish soap dries out and becomes less slippery, unlike lithium grease or other options. It is possible it was carried over from an appropriate and approved installation method for top hinged pedals, where pressing down will push the rubber pad’s grove deeper into the metal shoe and not cause removal. For bottom hinged pedals, preferred for performance cars, I wouldn’t recommend that at all. One off possibility is that this is NUMI knowledge making its way to Tesla ownership. I don’t disagree with the takeaway though. If they were trying to Toyota Method/Six Sigma this assembly line properly, they’d have reviewed and approved the change as part of a periodic process and it wouldn’t have been “unapproved” and probably would not be the process they used. Adding to my “it could have happened to any manufacturer” my EV Porsche comes with a NEMA 14-50 plug/pigtale that was previously only approved for use in 16 Amp EVSEs. The wire says 16A only (10 or 12ga wire is in use). However, they kept using these on 40 amp capable EVSEs. Over the years many 14-50 outlets and these plugs have melted. Through that time Porsche blamed low quality outlets and recommended an industrial model, but the plugs then melted instead of the outlet. Only this year did they issue a recall. This is extremely similar to an issue that happened with Tesla’s EVSE plug adapters. Porsche managed to make the same exact mistake years later despite that being an easy situation to reference. https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCMN-23V841-8821.pdf https://www.tesla.com/support/adapter-recall reply jsight 15 hours agorootparent> One off possibility is that this is NUMI knowledge making its way to Tesla ownership.

Even a mature operation like Toyota and Ford can blunder. reply fuzzfactor 13 hours agorootparentFor me it was a situation where I've never heard of another case, so I guess highly anecdotal, but can see how it might have applied to millions of regular old Ford ICE cars that were on the road. At one end of the accelerator linkage is the \"user interface\" (gas pedal) and at the other end it's the entire V8 engine. Where the linkage connects directly to the throttle using optimized leverage and failure-mitigating springs that can overcome a number of foreseeable failure scenarios. Which had gradually been improved since the Model T and through the entire Space Age. Runaway acceleration wasn't a problem with the pedal. Engine was running properly too. And the linkage was perfect. Well the engine is heavy and is not bolted directly to the frame of the car, instead it uses motor mounts, which consist of a metal plate which bolts to the motor, and an opposite plate that bolts to the frame, separated by a thick hard rubber shock absorbing pad. Motor mounts are doing some of their isolation duty when you see an idling engine under the hood shimmying a little while the fenders and hood are nicely stationary. Anyway it took years to figure out because it happened so seldom, and the cause & effect were so widely separated in time, but one day while navigating a jeep trail the engine had bottomed out, and that must have been the time one of the motor mounts separated, while the engine was momentarily forced an inch or more away from its normal position. Nothing ever seemed any different, but every once in while when I would accelerate from a stop, the pedal would drop almost to the floor and it would really take off until I got my foot under the pedal and pulled it back. Turns out the torque was occasionally capable of twisting the engine in the direction away from the broken mount, enough to be pulling on the linkage, opening the throttle further, and resulting in more torque. Might have had something to do with the octane of the gasoline in use. I guess at either end of the linkage you want the rubber to be bonded to the metal a lot better than you might think at first. reply asddubs 16 hours agoparentprevI'm kind of uneasy about this being possible at all.

And instead just stated that millions of Tesla cars were recalled, the default assumption being they were recalled to a service dealership instead of an OTA update at home. The oil lobbyists and Tesla haters absolutely don't want the phrase 'software' in any of the media headlines or HN titles relating to Tesla software recalls and vehemently argued against it. The media grants their wishes. It's hardly surprising that Tesla fans are not demanding that the word recall not be used for this car hardware issue, even they're more rational and less delusional about car recall phrasing than Tesla haters who seem to be agenda driven to create negative perception about Tesla, and the media happily accommodates them all the time. reply FireBeyond 18 hours agorootparentThis spin on things is hilarious. It wasn’t the “Tesla haters” screaming “don’t mention our precious software! It’s just a recall!”, it was the Tesla fans. “How can it be a recall if it can be fixed without my car going anywhere? The media just wants to make Tesla look bad! This isn’t a recall because Tesla can update it OTA, something the dinosaurs can’t!” (Which ignores that while Tesla can update more than most other manufacturers, my car gets regular OTA updates too.) Meanwhile Lincoln sent me a “fix” for a recall that involved neither software or my car moving an inch. “We identified an issue in your vehicles user guide that could lead to improper seat operation. Please place this piece of paper between pages 168 and 169 of your guide.” That was a recall, too. reply ripjaygn 17 hours agorootparentThis was the article headline from NYPost(yay oil lobby funding anti-EV right wing media posted on HN): \"Latest recall at Elon Musk’s Tesla affecting 2.2M vehicles over warning lights\" The recall over \"warning lights\" turned out be a font size increase in the UI on the screen. I guess it's a light because pixels glow. This was CNN's headline: \"Tesla recalls nearly all 2 million of its vehicles on US roads\" CNN doesn't like Tesla as well. Do you think NYPost or the CNN shouldn't have added 'software' in the headline, perhaps before the word recall? Why or why not? Not even saying it should be 'over-the-air software recall'. It can't be a space issue, NYPost found the space to add \"Elon Musk\" to the headline to fuel extra negativity and the CNN's headline is short. reply klyrs 13 hours agorootparent> yay oil lobby funding anti-EV right wing media posted on HN But we must blame the left whenever the right eats itself!

So they demonize Tesla and EVs and the left has joined them since a few years, to my disgust. I used to be a die hard liberal, I only lately realized that liberal media and many liberals don't care two hoots about climate change. I used to defend them all the time. They've been publishing hit pieces and even fake news about Tesla just because they don't like Musk. They lost the moral high ground about fake news. Those are heavily upvoted on liberal social media like HN and Reddit. I don't like what Musk has been doing lately but I do care about the environment and don't hate Tesla and SpaceX like people on here. I was going to buy an EV even at a price premium but now I don't care. I'll buy a gas guzzler like the rest. I am too old for climate change to affect me and it turns out the young ones don't care enough about it themselves. I used to be very liberal but seeing how Tesla is maligned on HN and Reddit changed me. I don't think I will vote red but I will never vote blue from now on. And then more liberals will wonder why the vote is so close come November. reply FireBeyond 10 hours agorootparent> I used to be a die hard liberal I have such skepticism on these things. I don't think you alter your fundamental world view on things like human rights, the environment and such because of \"liberal media\". I think exposure to viewpoints that either validate your biases or contradict your worldview strengthen your position, and rarely change it. In short, I am always skeptical about \"I used to be a liberal, but...\" (and for clarity, \"I used to be conservative, but...\") - it's almost exclusively a weird argument to authority. \"I know, I understand, I got you. But I saw the light.\" No, you were probably always conservative, deep down. This can also differ if you're talking exclusively the political parties, who generally fall under \"all suck\" in my view. reply FireBeyond 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is a straw man that you have concocted that says that \"Tesla haters\" (and I will own my bias here, despite being the target audience[1] for Tesla, I am a fan neither of the vehicles or the CEO) who are in the software industry are pressing for these recalls to be called out as recalls and not \"just a software update\". Some of these are \"recalls that can be fixed with software, often OTA\". They're still recalls, no matter how you spin it. Because they affect safety. Maybe in a minor way, in an edge case, in some cases, but nonetheless, despite your sarcastic pouting of \"I guess it's a light because pixels glow\". Just like it's a recall when Lincoln says \"insert this page into your owner's handbook\", or Toyota says \"affix this sticker at the bottom of p 232\". > Do you think NYPost or the CNN shouldn't have added 'software' in the headline, perhaps before the word recall? I, personally could not care less whether the word software appears or does not appear in the headline. I care that it's called a recall. I'm sorry that that hurts some Tesla fans feelings in that they think it makes things sound less safer. OTA updates for safety issues were still a safety issue. And I have zero sympathy when I listen, as I have here on HN, to same fans insisting that its a conspiracy to insist on it, while pretzeling themselves into saying that my user manual examples are still recalls \"because I still had to do something about them, while their issue was fixed in their sleep\".

I think Tesla's are overrated for their price - the Model S has (I haven't been in one in 18 months, to be clear) luxury euro pricing for a build quality that is in many cases worse than an econobox Hyundai or Mazda. I lean on the dash in my Audi and it doesn't bow or flex or creak or make me worried that some plastic is about to break. It did in the S. My butt fell asleep after a few hours in a Tesla passenger seat. \"Do not use a car wash if the vehicle will be in direct sunlight\". Windshields not glued on, at all. Entire brakes missing. Different tires on all four wheels. These aren't teething issues, Tesla is more than two decades old at this point. And doubly so when your CEO gives interviews that have him saying with a straight face, \"At this point, I know more about manufacturing than any person living on the planet.\" reply root_axis 13 hours agorootparentprevA recall is a recall.

Many of the headlines call out the reasons, I see no persecution of Tesla in the way you describe. There is an easy way for Tesla to avoid all of this though, and it’s to design their vehicles better in the first place.

Tesla is slipping and there seems to be some who are more sensitive to that being discussed than others. reply jsight 15 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, software recalls are just a scam by big post office. /s (more seriously, software updates trigger a required mailed notification, even if the work has already been done. physical recalls do not trigger the same requirement) reply ripjaygn 20 hours agorootparentprevYou're saying tech news and the articles that make HN's front page make a lot of tech people wrongly assume that Tesla is way worse with recalls than other car companies? Like we are seeing all over the comments here. Looks like \"a lot of Tesla fans\" are right then.

The OTA is the crucial point because as a customer you just don’t care that you wake up one day and your tesla starts displaying PARK instead of an icon after a „recall”. With other vehicles you gotta schedule service and leave it there. reply croes 13 hours agorootparentMy point is that other manufacturers' recalls could also be simple software updates but without OTA you need to visit a garage. So just because Tesla could fix most of their problem oer OTA doesn't mean other manufacturers have more severe malfunctions, just a more complicated way of fixing it. And OTA is nice until someone finds an unfixable bug and changes your brake setting per malicious OTA. As a customer, I do care if someone can change important systems in my car without me noticing or being able to prevent it. reply ripjaygn 11 hours agorootparentIf it's a software update that only a service center can fix then few folks are going to take their time out to do that expeditiously, like with hardware recalls.

Later, a different team member would pull that into an InDesign plugin where we could easily read what styles had been applied to the text in quill, and style that using the styling in InDesign. This was used when the front desk person would enter in a legal notice for a newspaper, and the production team would be the ones who would get that into InDesign for printing. The quill delta format that it uses made this process so much easier than if we were to have been given HTML like most other editors output / save.

It's easy to integrate, the json delta format works decently well, and is pretty straightforward, but one thing I find myself doing whenever I use it is asking myself, \"Should I just be using prosemirror?\". I find Quill to be a great stopgap solution for when I need editing and I need it quick, but in the back of my mind I'm always mentally adding that I'll need a migration plan should that specific feature ever grow in requirements. reply eropple 13 hours agoparentI've been looking at ProseMirror (mostly through tiptap2, which seems to wrangle it effectively) but taking the jump is daunting. I'd be interested in others' experiences. reply notresidenter 13 hours agorootparentTiptap is a great wrapper around ProseMirror, and if you need to dig deep, TipTap lets you do that but the documentation, for both TipTap and PM isn't as good as it could be and the conceptual model for PM is _hard_ to pick up on the go. I've spent several days on it to get close to what we spec-ed, granted, that's probably a tenth of what I would've spent if I had to build it from scratch, but definitely an investment, because getting all the little interactive details and the way that the custom inline/block elements should work just as the user expects is _hard_. Overall, it's the only tool I found that makes it as easy as possible to create a good writing/editing experience but it's a hard easy. reply wgj 13 hours agorootparentprevI've used prosemirror enough to have written custom nodes, commands, and custom code around its collaboration model. I got good results with all of this and I don't know any other platform that could have matched it. The docs are thoughtful. There's an up-front learning curve to understand the architecture. When doing highly customized things, I referred to the source when needed. For standard rich text, there are a lot of options. Prosemirror shines when you want to build on it as a platform. reply pier25 9 hours agorootparentprevI spent weeks back in 2020 fighting with PM trying to customize behaviors such as bullet points etc. At the time the documentation was sparse and for me progress was extremely hard.

We started using Quill 1.x around 2016, I initially liked it a lot. Jason proactively reached out to me when I first tweeted about considering Quill, and he was helpful when I had questions about the implementation. Fast forward to 2019, we were running into some bugs, Quill 1.x was in maintenance mode, and 2.0 was effectively undocumented [1]. I reached out to Jason on Twitter [2] to get a sense for the timeline, and he basically told me to get lost. (Also his company Slab now blocks me on Twitter, though I imagine he just meant to block me from his personal account.) Everyone has stressful days, especially when building a startup, so maybe that was just a bad time for me to reach out. My best guess is that they were focused on their own company (fair!) and barely had the time to maintain Quill for their own internal usage, let alone release it as open source. If that's the case, I wish they'd been upfront about it. 5 years later, Quill v2 is finally live. I'm glad to see Slab is still around, and I hope they have the bandwidth to publicly maintain Quill going forward. But if you're thinking about using this in production, I would push on what their commitment is to supporting it, and have a plan for if they stop responding. (Jason, if you're on this thread, no hard feelings, water under the bridge. Feel free to ignore or chime in with your own perspective.)

Which is frustrating because that’s what a RTE library (vs roll your own) is supposed to be. Not sure about v2, but the v1 code is just not very well architected. There are basic features we’ve held off on implementing for fear that it will lead to a million little bugs. The Delta format is the best thing about Quill by far.

I've deployed it in multiple applications with a lot of success. reply b33j0r 15 hours agorootparentWhat a journey. Used it in production when I just needed arbitrary richtext documents in whole. Customizing has been harder than anyone would like. I became an event sourcing aficionado, initially to support parchment’s delta format. It’s a solid idea, but also required (unless you do backend diffs, which I tried too). My vanity test: I can’t believe how hard it still is to make a TODO checklist with indented levels. I try like every 18 months, surveying the plugin ecosystem. It never works well, so far. Editor.js isn’t a one-stop rtf editor, but that was the first thing I noticed “just working.” That said, I’m upgrading an old prototype to quill v2 today. reply ulrischa 14 hours agorootparentI really like to hear about experience with Editor.js. It looks like the most modern editor but seems complicated. Is this true? reply lukasb 5 hours agoprevCan anyone compare to Lexical? reply kabes 4 hours agoparentLexical is more of a framework comparable to prosemirror. Learning curve is therefore higher, but IMO way more flexible and better designed than quill. reply pmlnr 13 hours agoprevIs anyone aware of a word processor, text editor, whatever, that can handle HTML definition lists natively? reply crabmusket 9 hours agoparentI'd really like a WYSIWYG editor that's designed to produce HTML documents.

HTML has great prose features, but it seems like there's nothing in between Microsoft Word and \"now you're building a website\". reply oneeyedpigeon 1 hour agorootparentI guess one of the many Markdown editors is what you're looking for, then you just need to add a build step at the end. Unless you need any of the 'document' features of html that aren't in md, of course. reply bachmeier 11 minutes agorootparentI don't think so. They were pretty specific: \"I'd really like a WYSIWYG editor\". reply netghost 11 hours agoparentprevProbably prosemirror. I don't know that it's built in by default, but it's well within prosemirror's model, so it shouldn't require a large investment to use. That said, prosemirror's got a pretty steep learning curve. reply bhl 58 minutes agorootparentNothing is built into ProseMirror except for the text span. For a definition list, you’d probably want two node types: a definition list, and a definition list item.

However, elsewhere they say \"Quill exposes its own document model, a powerful abstraction over the DOM, allowing for extension and customization. The upper limit on the formats and content Quill can support is unlimited. Users have already used it to add embedded slide decks, interactive checklists, and 3D models.\" I wish they had a page covering what it takes to create a custom content type for the Quill DOM. reply claytongulick 13 hours agorootparentI developed a project that went deep into quill and its capabilities. It's relatively straightforward to develop little widgets that can plug into the renderer. I did it for several classes of healthcare information, with \"smart links\" with embedded icons for things like appointments, medications, etc... Even better, I was able to use vanilla web components for the markup that got embedded, and quill was able to use it just fine. Was a huge success and worked great. reply toddmorey 11 hours agorootparentThat's awesome news!

A friend of mine works at Microsoft and they have never heard of this project. • Is it that they know one person at Microsoft, any random employee among +221k, who uses the editor? • Or is it that one of the developers works at Microsoft? (which, unless they are Satya Nadella, shouldn’t matter) • Or is it that their (not so anonymous) telemetry tells them that someone is using the editor from a Microsoft-owned IP address? • Or are the company logos simply there to mislead potential new users into thinking those companies actually trust the developer(s)? reply eropple 14 hours agoparentQuill's an extremely well-known JavaScript rich text editing control, not an \"app\". Were you confused by the example at the top of the landing page? Your friend might not have heard of it, but I'd be more surprised if Microsoft didn't have significant projects using it because it's so well-established. And having large adopters of an open-source library featured on the landing page is not unusual.

[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders eggdaft 0 minutes agoI’ve applied a few times, considering stopping applying. What I’m more concerned about is (a) everyone seems to be incredibly young, I’m not, and (b) being a solo founder means you’re almost certain not to be accepted. Are these correct? Is it worth bothering with? reply bschmidt1 12 hours agoprevRe: \"won't get in\" How do I balance this encouraging advice with everything I've heard online about YC basically being a post-Ivy League thing? Seems like there's basically a 0% chance a random person would get into YC. And often those who did get in went to Stanford, Harvard, etc. and don't even have a product - sometimes they don't even know what they're going to build yet. I wrote the idea of VC stuff off long ago. My wife and I have a profitable business here in SF that would be perfect as a startup, but the concept of raising funds to expand literally hasn't even crossed our minds because it seems so geared toward post-grads - like something only Stanford and Harvard people get access to after they graduate. Not only that, we're profitable, and can even articulate a realistic vision about how it becomes the next $100M household name, but the numbers I've read online that most VCs want to see are not realistic - or if we were hitting those numbers I wouldn't even need a VC, we would be able to fund our own expansion. So we're just doing it on our own. reply jacobwg 12 hours agoparentI mean, I didn't even graduate college :P > So we're just doing it on our own. IMO if you can become a $100M household name without VC, that's absolutely the way to do it. Even if you do take the VC path, YC for me was a massive boost in network, knowledge, and resources that I didn't have before, but it's also not the only way to acquire those things. You can even find that YC knowledge online, e.g. https://www.startupschool.org/. That said, if anyone's even considering applying to YC, I'd recommend it, at a minimum it's a forcing function to think more deeply about your idea or business when assembling the application. reply bdjsiqoocwk 11 hours agorootparent> I mean, I didn't even graduate college :P Yes, but did you go to one of those colleges where dropping out is even better than graduating? Because most of us didn't even get the chance to drop out of one of those. reply llamaimperative 11 hours agorootparentI'm a YC founder and I dropped out of not-one-of-those colleges (RPI). My cofounder dropped out of high school. Why not just give it a shot? Find the powerful parts of your story (I'm sure they exist) and share them! We applied, as GP advocates for, mostly to sharpen our thinking. Just the application process would've been worth the time, even if we had gotten declined immediately. The interview 10x'd that value, then the YC batch itself was another multiple on top of that. reply _delirium 5 hours agorootparentI would definitely count RPI as one of \"those\" colleges! I guess everyone has a different list, but for me, RPI is in the same category as Rose-Hulman, Olin, Harvey Mudd, etc. Perhaps not Ivy League level in the sense of being a household name, but still known among people in the field. reply tobinfricke 4 hours agorootparentThe \"Ivy League\" consists of precisely these eight schools: Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale. Honestly I feel like some of these are negative indicators when it comes to engineering cred. Meanwhile, stellar engineering schools like Caltech, Stanford, and MIT are in a league of their own. This comment is mostly to complain that using \"Ivy League\" as a shorthand for prestigious engineering schools is inaccurate. reply jacobwg 10 hours agorootparentprevNot that I'm aware of, no, just the local state school. My impression of the YC application process was that it was way more holistic than just educational background. reply threeseed 10 hours agorootparentYC approval process is pretty much this: - Do I even understand your idea. - Have you talked to customers. - Am I impressed in your use of time. - Do I believe that your team is capable of delivering. - Is it a good idea. Most people can't get past the first two but obsess over the last two. reply chaostheory 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is a really good point because the vast majority of YC members (97-99%) either graduated or dropped out from Ivy League level schools, or really highly rated state schools. (Dropouts are also a very small minority.) There are YC members who didn’t come from prestigious schools, but they are outliers. Maybe it’s changed the last 4 years? That’s when I stopped tracking it. reply dang 3 hours agorootparentThat's definitely not true. Where did you get these numbers? reply chaostheory 1 hour agorootparentI had a side project that was meant to be an “IMDB of everything”. For my initial focus, I targeted YC, its companies and members. This involved looking at a lot of LinkedIn profiles and recording their alma mater because I wanted to give credit to organizations as well and not just individuals. That’s how I came to that conclusion. The result surprised me as well but it also makes sense. Investors would be more eager to invest if the founders were already part of some of their networks. People from these schools also tend to be more inclined to be higher achievers than other places on average. The only time where there was more educational diversity was probably only during the 1st two years of YC. Has it changed in recent years? I would rather be wrong on this one. reply Rapzid 12 hours agoparentprevThe LinkedIn page for a lot of these companies showing you \"Where they studied\" can be a bit intimidating. Chockablock with Stanford and Ivy League. I was filling out the Co-Founder matching service application and it has a required text area for education. The placeholder text examples? Standford MS in Comp Sci, NYU BS in Physics. As a college dropout with \"some college\" but a 14+ year career in systems/software engineering roles, that was quite discouraging. reply dang 12 hours agorootparentI'm with you and wish that we were more careful with this sort of signaling risk. However, there are tons of college dropouts and uncredentialed software people who make it in to YC. What I'm basically trying to tell everyone, and hoping to convince a few, is: don't listen to any of this, just do it. reply Rapzid 12 hours agorootparentI'm also with you! Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps as a data point. Gates, Jobs, and Zuck all famously dropped out of college of course. It's an interesting and tricky social dynamic matching within and between these somewhat distinct groups. reply dgfitz 10 hours agorootparentSo did Elizabeth Holmes. reply hindsightbias 8 hours agorootparentprev> Gates, Jobs, and Zuck Harvard, Reed, Harvard. Any drop out from any of those has hurdled more than 98% of the general college corps. Or at least that would be a rational assumption by the VC cadre that is probably in the top 0.1% and an Ivy League grad. reply Rapzid 7 hours agorootparentPeople are commenting on this but failing to stake out a real point. Is the point that just having been accepted to those schools is a strong signal? I would concede that it could be, sure. But a lot of people drop out of Ivy league schools and simply flame out. Many would consider dropping out of those schools after a few semesters as failure. And many companies still require degrees; a few semesters at Harvard won't cut it. I guess my point is that college dropouts are also successful at creating startups. Two have started the two most valuable companies in the world. reply brandall10 17 minutes agorootparentI'd argue getting accepted is almost the entire signal. These people dropped out to chase extremely lucrative business opportunities - that they created as a student, likely aided by structural/networking support inside that institution - due to timing risk. One could argue they not only got into a highly prestigious institution, but they quickly leapfrogged everyone there. That's the opposite of flaming out. reply bdjsiqoocwk 11 hours agorootparentprevDidn't they ask drop out from Harvard or something? It's a bit disingenuous to say that. reply tempusalaria 11 hours agorootparentSteve Jobs went to an obscure private school called Reed which seems to be something he became obsessed with due to LSD. Zuck and Gates both dropped out of Harvard after founding their companies. reply alephnerd 10 hours agorootparentReed is a great liberal arts college. Very intense and quirky academic culture, and being in Portland OR lends to an amazing college town vibe. Sometimes I wish I went there instead of my Alma mater. reply dimmke 10 hours agorootparentprevJust curious, I was filling out my profile and it says Education History required. Normally that means college experience. I only did one year at a local community college. Should I just put that? My cofounder is attending a well respected school though. reply dang 9 hours agorootparentSure why not? If I were you I'd try not to worry too much about what will/won't seem good—what YC is pattern-matching for is usually quite different than what people assume. reply jasperstory 11 hours agorootparentprevJust finished W24 batch with no Ivy/FAANG background. Everyone I met in our batch was very friendly, curious, and razor-sharp. Many people have credentialed backgrounds, many people do not. I generally buy YC’s justification that many of the smartest people happen to go to Stanford/Ivy which is why they are over-represented. reply bschmidt1 9 hours agorootparent> the smartest people happen to go to Stanford There's no way this is even possible, let alone true. This might be a hot take but if you're under the age of 25, it's likely that you know very few things total. And the things you do know, you're just not going to have a master level of understanding of in your 20s yet nor the drive to focus on it the way it needs, especially with other social pressures at play. What is extremely high in your 20s is your ambition - your loftiness of ideas and goals and your expectations of yourself - these can land you exceptional jobs, opportunities, and get you to a great starting point, but that's not the same as intelligence and ability. For manual labor work, there's a definite peak - college age and the years just after. But for knowledge work, math, programming, business, politics, etc. being older is almost always an asset - you get better at things, you get smarter, your networks grow, you become an adult among the children and are far more aware of timing and can predict and speak on things with more accuracy. You simply know more. Besides that, I don't think raw intelligence is selection criteria for a good founder anyway. It has a lot more to do with your particular situation - how well you're situated to pull it off, which can mean many things. In terms of personal qualities it probably has more to do with determination and obsession (work ethic) than intelligence, especially these days where information is so cheap and available. reply jasperstory 9 hours agorootparentAh sorry for clarity I didn't mean \"currently attend\", and agree \"smartest\" here was probably excessively casual. I think there's different benefits at different ages, and agree on importance of determination and obsession. A good market is the only thing that might be more useful. reply bbarnett 2 hours agorootparentprevThere is a lot of variance in how words are used, so I'm not going to say you're wrong here. However, my usage of the following words deviate from yours: * intelligence - raw intellect, having absolutely nothing to do with anything ever learned * smarts - synonym for raw intellect, but often more on the 'crafty' side of raw intellect * ability - short for 'capabilities', and is a merge of 'intelligence' and 'learned information'. Information is useless without intellect, and intellect is vastly reduced in capability without learned information. Ability is a metric for these two conjoined. 'Skilled' fits here too. So from where I sit, you never get \"smarter\" as you age. You do however grow your abilities, you may become \"wise\", and skilled. By the way, agree 100% with the context of what you're saying. And just passing on term usage from another geolocation. reply dgfitz 9 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think you can make that argument in good faith: “many of the smartest people happen to go to Stanford/Ivy”. I think you _can_ say that many smart people go to Stanford/Ivy. reply sokoloff 51 minutes agorootparentIn the usage above “many of” I read to mean “smart people are significantly over-represented” at those places rather than anything stronger. reply lispybanana 6 hours agorootparentprevDiscouraging, sure, but now the real question: did you apply anyway? :) I hope you did! reply alephnerd 12 hours agoparentprev> YC basically being a post-Ivy League thing I have a lot of friends of mine who are decade+ YoE first time founders who have done very very well in YC. Lots of Enterprise SaaS companies have went thru YC and done very well - you just don't hear about them as much because Direct Enterprise Sales doesn't require as much marketing. There are similar B2C successes by older founders and non-Ivy/Ivy Tier founders. > we're profitable, and can even articulate a realistic vision about how it becomes the next $100M household name You could easily pitch a Seed or Pre-Seed round depending on the numbers and location right now. I guarantee you that you are a 2nd or 3rd degree connect with plenty of VCs.

ZS started in the mid-2000s, work on Rubrik started in the 2013 time period). One notable mid-late state Enterprise firm I've been following is Vanta. Others have been very successful acquihires (eg. Squeen becoming a core part of the Security BU at Datadog). Salt Security is a good product as well, but will most likely be acquihired. Usually, most enterprise companies choose to be acquired because even though the pot of gold at IPO is amazing, it is annoying to work on the same product for 10-15 years (though occasionally you do have startups just being stupid at strategy - looking at you Lacework smh, coulda acquihired Wiz or Orca 4-5 years ago). reply llamaimperative 11 hours agorootparentprevConsumer != mainstream reply 999900000999 12 hours agoparentprevI had ambitions of cranking out an MVP and pitching it to VCs in my late 20s. After a year of solid rejection ( including YC not even responding), I gave up. You end up spending alot of time trying to pitch your work. I've had a few idea guys expect me to build MVPs for free with an offer of like 1% or something silly like that. Never any pay, poorly thought out concepts. I've accepted I'm never going to be rich, it's easier this way. reply apsurd 12 hours agorootparentThe filters are self-fulfilling. For twenty-somethings ideas are easy and all opportunity is in front. Might as well swing for the fences and yes people do hit home runs. At this stage, debating the actual statistics is misguided use of energy. Because justifying a reason not to play still means you're not playing. And the older you get the more gray this calculus is. There's more reasons not to do something. We put the filters on ourselves. This isn't a moral argument. No one really knows how the statistics will land, we can only back analyze them. Yes it's statistically very unlikely you're going to get funded. So you stopped trying. Maybe your ideas really weren't very good.

Otherwise the way to get to them is via accelerators like YC. And the way to get into accelerators with no credentials is to launch something and get some traction. It doesn’t even need to be a lot of traction. Just having users who use your product regularly puts you near the top of the pile. reply sosodev 12 hours agorootparentprevYou can still be rich. Tech culture, or rather modern capitalism, tells us that businesses need to raise a bunch of money, capture a bunch of users, and then squeeze them for all they'll take. It fails us in two very distinct ways. It encourages us to think that is the only viable option and it's unethical. Primarily because it requires the perception of customers (and often employees) as a means to an end (not humans). However, the possibility for ethical, sustainable business models is still very real. I tend to believe we're going to see another wave of those soon as people figure out that it's actually easier to make a living that way. reply queuebert 8 hours agorootparent> the possibility for ethical, sustainable business models is still very real.

The difficult part for us software folk is learning to apply that model to software. Customers in the world of software generally don’t know what they want. I think the low hanging fruit here is to copy products from the unethical companies and beat them at caring for the customers. The real value is probably in new product models that can only exist given an ethical perspective. Perhaps reviving the mostly dead pay once use forever model of software would work well. That model requires abandoning DRM which the unethical companies will never do. reply necovek 4 hours agorootparentCustomers for other trades similarly \"don't know what they want\", unless it's \"fix this for me\". The main difference in the software world is that you can potentially build things \"once\" (or rather, keep building it forever) for a huge global market, which means that it's hard to know when something is good enough.

There are different roles founders hire for under the \"founding engineer\" umbrella. There is your fresh out of bootcamp \"founding engineer\" brought on during pre-seed or seed stages to help bash out POCs and mocks used to sell the vision. Then there is the \"founding engineer\" they bring in post money and customer commitments to actually deliver the MVP and help build out a professional engineering program. I'm in the later category and those roles can pay very well for early stage startups. reply tibbar 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you actually get 1% at seed stage and the company goes through a \"few rounds\" of funding (and subsequently exits), you're doing great. You've basically won a small lottery and have an excellent chance of being a millionaire. The problem with startup equity is that this is a very rare scenario, and most of the other scenarios aren't so good. If the company doesn't exit, your equity is worthless. If they exit at a value below your strike price, and you exercised your options, you could end up in debt. Lots of ways for this to end badly. reply tempusalaria 25 minutes agorootparentThat’s my point. Even in massive outlier upside cases getting a 1% equity deal at seed is not really worth more than just being a standard FAANG worker. And that requires many rounds of funding an and dilution and an exit. It’s worth remembering exits are very hard right now and founders have far more liquidity options. There have been multiple unicorns I’m aware of in the past 5 years with founders taking 8 figures in secondary and employees getting nothing. Now those unicorns have worthless equity for employees and the founders are on the beach. reply RowanH 12 hours agoparentprev> My wife and I have a profitable business here in SF that would be perfect as a startup Keep doing what you're doing. Being VC funded shouldn't be the holy grail - the holy grail is having a business you enjoy doing, that's making you the life you want. For some the life you want is pitching, raising, getting the kudos of the big numbers, onto the next raise etc. For some the life you want is the complete opposite and bootstrapping it. For some it's just all about the technical aspect, coding the next crazy thing. There's no wrong or right answer in how you get to the 'happy place'. You know in your heart of hearts what drives you, and what you'll be happy doing. Me : I'd been with the money men for a period of years and it's super stressful, board reporting, projections, market analysis etc. Now I've got my little B2B SaaS startup that's blended a life long passion with my software chops, and our clients love us, we get to work with the absolutely best people in our industry, we're making a difference in their lives, and they in turn pay us money. It's hard, rewarding, graft. At the end of the week when the money lands in stripe (for me..) there's nothing artificial, there's no projections, there's no-one to pay back, it's a 100% value exchange of 'heres my(our) hardwork, here's a product and you're giving me money for it'. Sure - could I potentially have gone the VC route (maybe!). Would it be different, hell yes. Would I (probably) earn more ultimately 5 years down the line (sure?). That 5 years would be very, very different... reply bschmidt1 10 hours agorootparentI really appreciate this comment. Service offered / payment received is irreplaceably wholesome and satisfying :) especially when they come back as repeat customers or become regular clients. Repeat business and gradual growth gives us both an exciting feeling about the future that I never quite felt at a startup. I've found too often a venture-backed startup is really a lifestyle business in disguise for the founders, not really about serving customers, so it's hard to truly get excited about them anymore. Where running a business that solves a problem for paying customers feels more like changing the world: > we're making a difference in their lives, and they in turn pay us money We've felt this too in our community, it's the real meaning of \"Make something people want\" (and why we haven't had a day off in like 62 days or something lol). It's strange to refer to our business as a \"startup\", but it is one, moreso than most VC-funded ones and I bet we have more customers, higher revenues, and a better growth outlook than the average local seed-funded startup. For us, a loan or VC route would just let us expand nationally right now to other major cities, instead of focusing first on the Bay Area and expanding nationally over the next several years which feels inevitable. The amount a VC might pressure us to go in the wrong direction is another worry, and because it's just capital we'd need (not advice), they might just get in the way and throw off timing or team structure. Thanks for your comment! I needed the reminder of how rewarding it is compared to conventional employment as today has been exceptionally hectic! reply RowanH 8 hours agorootparentYou're welcome ! Best wishes for your business :) reply bschmidt1 7 hours agorootparentYou too! reply rachofsunshine 10 hours agoparentprevThere are a lot of legitimate criticisms to be made of YC and of VCs in general (please do not take this as me going \"there is nothing wrong in the VC world at all\", because I absolutely do not believe that!), but I don't think excessive academic elitism is one of them. If anything, I think they're quite a bit better about avoiding that elitism than the average you'll find among organizations of comparable wealth and power (compare top law firms, leadership of more traditional companies, politicians, etc). This isn't my strongest opinion - I've never done any proper formal study of the question - but your impressions contradict my own experience living in that world. I used to be part of the leadership team for a YC company. Here's where the four YC founders I know off the top of my head went to school: SUNY, Oxford, Epitech, Tufts. Only Oxford among those is truly elite, though the other three are good schools. The one who went to Oxford (Harj Taggar) is a bit of an odd one out here, since they were a partner with YC itself first before founding the company that I know them from. Granted, three of these were founders many years ago, so perhaps this has changed, but one (the Tufts alum) got funding only about a year ago. I looked up a few other founders that are second- or third-degree connections and found the same: a handful of truly elite schools, a peak in A-tier-but-not-truly-elite schools, and a handful of no-name schools like my own alma mater. I expect that that's a reasonably representative distribution of where you find extremely smart people, and especially smart+motivated ones. As for this bit: >> And often those who did get in went to Stanford, Harvard, etc. and don't even have a product - sometimes they don't even know what they're going to build yet. YC is pretty explicit that they try to pick founders, not ideas, most of the time. That approach is all over the Startup School videos, for example; they don't exactly make a secret of it. >> but the numbers I've read online that most VCs want to see are not realistic - or if we were hitting those numbers I wouldn't even need a VC, we would be able to fund our own expansion. Growth demands, both realistic and unrealistic, are a much fairer criticism IMO. They're the primary reason I haven't sought VC funding personally (from YC or otherwise). Out of curiosity, I'd love to know more about what you're doing - I checked your HN profile but it didn't have a link or anything. reply april192024 7 hours agorootparent>>> \"YC is pretty explicit that they try to pick founders, not ideas, most of the time. That approach is all over the Startup School videos, for example; they don't exactly make a secret of it.\" If Y Combinator truly prioritizes founders over ideas, as indicated in their Startup School videos, repeated rejections might suggest a fundamental mismatch. If you haven't been accepted after one or two tries, it may be a signal that you're not the type of founder they're looking to fund. People do not change that much usually. reply dang 7 hours agorootparentIt's exactly the other way around. You'd be right if YC were perfect at assessing founders every time, but of course they're not. Applying repeatedly gives you a chance to prove that they got you wrong the first time (and the second, and the third, and so on, if need be). Not only does this work, it's the majority case (I just double checked this). Most founders that YC funds are repeat applicants. Applying repeatedly demonstrates persistence, which is one of the qualities YC looks for. Better still, if you can show continued progress since your previous application, that demonstrates resourcefulness, another core quality. Repeated applications can move the needle on what sort of founder YC thinks you are. Especially if you were a borderline call the last time—keeping going, and applying again, is a way to get on the other side of the line. reply april192024 3 hours agorootparentYC frequently heralds persistence as the most reliable indicator of future success. However, a closer look at their selection practices reveals a profound contradiction. Despite their public endorsement of this trait, YC often rejects applicants who demonstrate true persistence by reapplying after initial failures. In contrast, they appear to favor individuals with prestigious academic or corporate backgrounds—those who might be perceived as career opportunists lacking deep commitment to their ventures—over genuinely dedicated founders. This pattern not only questions the sincerity of YC's stated values but also suggests a broader inconsistency. If such a discrepancy exists in their evaluation of persistence, one can reasonably doubt the authenticity of other virtues YC promotes. This insight casts a shadow over the overall integrity of their selection criteria, hinting that what YC publicizes may not always align with their actual priorities. reply dang 3 hours agorootparentPersistence is important but I don't think anyone said it was \"the most reliable indicator\". It's possible to be persistent at something that isn't working and isn't going to work (I know; I've done it). That's not useful, so persistence is far from sufficient. It is necessary though. If there's a most-reliable-indicator at all, it would be something like what pg called 'relentless resourcefulness'. The includes persistence and a lot of other things as well. reply vlod 12 hours agoparentprevWhen the startup I co-founders applied to Techstars, we had to fill in the lean canvas diagram and it makes you think and write down a whole bunch of stuff that we were lacking. channels in, user-acquisition strategies etc. That process was super worth it.

There are a lot of ways the world has operated that are not fair or optimal. It would be a logical fallacy - an appeal to tradition - to use that as an argument against the way things could be, or according to OP the way things should be (are intended to be). Investing is a regulated activity that affects the economy and individuals, so I think it's at least worth exploring things like nepotism and exclusivity when it comes to the flow of capital.

There's nothing wrong with a business that grows slowly, pays you a salary, and remains profitable. I've walked a similar path and, while I'll never be a multi-millionaire, I'm very comfortable and have more than I need. Small, stable, businesses that offer good secure jobs are the backbone of the economy. All that said, there are investors out there who are interested in folk like you and me. A track record of success, coupled with potential, and immediate returns is attractive. VC investors are ultimately investing in people, not businesses. The idea matters to some extent, but its more of a pitch in the person or team. This is partly why college is so predominately material. In the folk \"starting out\" there's little else to look at. (Always have your first date on a famous college campus, then you can forever drop \"we met at harvard\" into the conversation.) To be honest, VC investing isn't for me at this stage in my life, and it may or may not be a good fit for you. For many it's a great fit though, and in some ways their \"first good job\".

Just my 2c as a long-time follower.

I've met some founders who went with Tribe8 (edit: Team8) or Sequoia Surge due to YC messaging issues and the (imo incorrect) perception that it's B2C or SMB B2B SaaS oriented.

And being a somewhat exclusive post-academic institution is not a bad image or message IMO. Maybe there are more pros than cons in terms of curation (of content, of founders). Really didn't see it as a \"everyone should apply!\" kinda place, thought the messaging was intentionally \"here's the latest out of Stanford\" which I'm fine with. reply dang 12 hours agorootparentYou're right about HN - pg always used to say he wanted it to look 'bookish'. But not for academic reasons. He's just a bibliophile and a massive reader. When it comes to YC, however, I'm way closer to the \"everyone should apply\" end of the spectrum. Or rather: everyone who thinks they might like to start a high-growth startup. One of YC's biggest impacts has been in growing the number of startups that get created in the first place. It's not so much about picking founders out of a limited pool, it's about the much larger set of potential founders who can maybe get bumped out of the \"I could never do that track\" into the adjacent \"maybe give it a try track\"...which can lead to life-changing places. pg's essays have been one of the biggest such bumping devices. I would like HN to be that too. (While remaining interesting in all the other ways it can be.) reply bschmidt1 12 hours agorootparentBookish, yeah, the look has aged well. My intuition was that there are more overly-confident types who think they want to be a founder rather than those not confident enough to do it, but after reading some comments here maybe my intuition was off.

Anyone who says ideas are worth nothing is flat out wrong. reply dang 8 hours agorootparentI think the claim is rather that idea is not the high-order bit in an early-stage startup funding decision; founders are. There's no success without eventually finding a good idea, especially since 'successful in the end' is practically the definition of 'good idea', or close enough to be inseparable. So it's not so much \"ideas don't matter\" as \"starting ideas don't matter\", as long as you're the type of founder who can excecute on an idea, change it as needed, and drop it when necessary. reply andrewstuart 7 hours agorootparentA great idea is incredibly valuable. In fact the idea is the key to great success. However, it is true that without great execution, timing and luck, a great idea will go nowhere.

Few banks support it yet, but some do. It needs consumer-facing support. The Fed just does the back end. There's a big security problem with consumer side payments - these are irrevocable no-holds transfers, like cash. Figure out how to handle that.

As for the 'uncredentialed' thing, there are a ton of forces at play and I'm sure there will be more credentialed folks applying due to financial and access reasons. I'm an uncredentialed person (state SUNY school) who got flown out for an interview for YC Winter 2020. I didn't get selected due to my proposal itself and shortcomings within it, not due to a lack of any credentials. I enjoyed the experience and learned a bit about it. I may apply again at some point for another venture I'm working on. reply juped 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is just an empirical question, right? What are the proportions of credentialed elites among all applicants and successful applicants? If this number is surprising, it would mean a lot more to people than any amount of insistence. reply choppaface 4 hours agorootparentprevNobody thinks YC is only for HYPS grads anymore now that Gary Tan has closely associated needless violence and excessively divisive tropes with YC e.g. https://techbrosf.weebly.com/ All in the name of business dominance of course. reply sillysaurusx 11 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately the rust game engine idea (as much as it kills me to say this) is a perfect example of not YC material. Every VC, whether early stage or late stage, must fund companies that have a chance of growing by 5% every week. It’s remarkably hard to start anything that can maintain that growth. https://paulgraham.com/growth.html is worth internalizing. But there’s a second caveat here: YC invests in people, not in ideas. From pg himself: https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/the-reddits > Their idea was bad though. And since we thought then that we were funding ideas rather than founders, we rejected them. But we felt bad about it. Jessica was sad that we'd rejected the muffins. And it seemed wrong to me to turn down the people we'd been inspired to start YC to fund. So it might be worth applying with a particularly bad idea. Or at least it used to be; I have no idea whether YC ever encourages strong founders with a bad idea to re-apply with a better one, or if you get any feedback from the partners that they almost accepted you but rejected because of the idea. (One of my neat memories as a 19yo is getting a thoughtful email from pg saying we almost made it to the interview with an idea that was essentially “blackboard sucks; make better school software,\" but the biggest factors against us were my age and the fact that selling to schools was about as hard as selling to governments back in 2008.) reply Animats 11 hours agorootparentI know that. I just threw that in because I've been doing game work in Rust and the graphics stack suffers from too few devs. Better school software is worth another go-round, now that we have large language models. Somebody already emailed me offering to fund the MoneyNow idea. That's a bad idea for another reason. The big problem with money transfer is fraud. PayPal is mostly a fraud-management service. Money transfer and user interface are the easy part. reply sillysaurusx 11 hours agorootparentI’d be very curious to see what you’d choose to work on if you were forced to pick something with the highest probability of growing at 5% per week minimum. I suspect you have a few ideas, but it becomes a different sort of question when you imagine yourself committing to one for the next 10 years. Which idea could you see yourself throwing all of your effort into growing each week till you’re today+10 years old? reply dang 11 hours agorootparent> the highest probability of growing at 5% per week minimum I don't think this is a helpful frame, because you can't know this in advance, and I'd hate for anybody to read something like this, feel \"I have no idea what could grow 5% per week minimum\", and close the page on getting started. No one knows this in advance. What YC teaches is to start by making something a few people actually want, no matter how small it is or seems, and then iterate. It's much more important, for example, to work on something you're personally interested in than something you've persuaded yourself has a chance at growing \"5% per week minimum\". reply sillysaurusx 10 hours agorootparentThat’s a good point. Thank you. Happy one-decade anniversary, by the way. I just noticed https://www.ycombinator.com/blog/meet-the-people-taking-over... was almost exactly 10 years ago. The trouble with your frame is that you can’t know what people actually want until you try to get them to use what you’ve built. There’s a sort of chicken and egg problem here: you have to think of an idea first, before you build anything. \"Choose what people actually want\" begs the question. It’s probably true that it’s better to work on something that you personally believe in (in the https://paulgraham.com/earnest.html sense), because you’re more likely to find ways to grow it. It’s hard to be earnest about an idea that only interests you because it might grow at 5% per week. But pg chose Viaweb, and he couldn’t have known ahead of time that anybody would actually want it, since it was the first webapp. Nobody even understood how to try it out, since this was the era of desktop software. All he had was a hunch that lots of people would soon want websites for their businesses. So which frame would you choose, if you had to decide today? Suppose you and Scott were trapped in a room, and the door unlocks only after you pick something to build together. How would you decide, other than \"X seems most likely to be something that people will actually want\"? (Which is similar to \"has a chance of growing at 5% per week,\" just phrased a little differently. pg originally thought museums would want websites; if he’d asked himself whether it might morph into an idea that could grow at 5% per week, he probably would’ve realized museums didn’t actually want that.) reply dgfitz 9 hours agorootparentI think your premise is flawed: > The trouble with your frame is that you can’t know what people actually want until you try to get them to use what you’ve built. I would argue that if you’re building something in a vacuum, you’re wasting your time. You should find your customers first. Find their pain points in their industry. See how those could be fixed. reply dang 10 hours agorootparentprevI would work on what I was most passionate about. Which btw is also the advice that pg and Jessica (specifically Jessica in this case) gave at their last YC talk, and you can't get more YC than that. reply sillysaurusx 10 hours agorootparentDid they? It’s surprising because your description can’t possibly be a recipe for generating startup ideas. pg was most passionate about lisp. There must be more to it than what you said. I try not to dismiss ideas out of hand, but this seems like bad advice for someone explicitly trying to become wealthy. It’s great advice for YC to be giving, because it would maximize YC’s returns over decades: if everyone works on what they’re most passionate about, YC would get a flood of applications from exactly the type of people most likely to be effective founders. But for every passionate founder that chooses to build Stripe, there are dozens who would choose to work on programming languages, or game engines. “Passion project\" is practically synonymous with an artist not intending to make money. Even if today you were most passionate about spreadsheets, would you really choose to build skysheet again? It’s impossible to imagine pg writing \"If I wanted to start a startup, I would work on what I was most passionate about, since it’s the most likely way I’d succeed.\" The sentence seems mistaken, so pg must have said something more precise. reply dang 6 hours agorootparentI was probably too concise. What I mean is that if I had to choose between two different ideas for what people want, I would pick the one I was more interested in, even if it seemed smaller at first, over one that had a better cover story but which I was bored by. And yes this is what Jessica said, advising a particular founder who had grown weary of what he was working on. I think the basic philosophy is that your starting point is not so important—you can get anywhere from anywhere, as long as you are (in pg's phrase) relentlessly resourceful. Given that starting point isn't so important, you're better off starting with something you have a lot of energy for. You're going to need it. Of course I would work on Skysheet again! When did spreadsheets stop being the most important thing in programming? reply sungho_ 7 hours agorootparentprevNo advice has a 100% success rate. The existence of failure cases doesn't inherently make the advice bad. The advice to pursue your passion as a startup idea is still relatively good advice. It's the best way to avoid the most trite and cliché ideas. I don't know what someone passionate about spreadsheets would create, but it would be more unexpected than building a generic AI writing app. Whether it succeeds or fails. reply eddd-ddde 7 hours agoparentprevUnrelated, but they _charge_ you for transferring money???

I've been building startups for a long time, and have applied to YC several times, mainly with the same idea (although I've always listed 4-5 other ideas I'm interested in as well). I have always gotten rejected, and while that was disappointing, I 100% understood that getting into YC was the exception rather than the rule, as YC had a smaller acceptance percentage than Harvard. After a few batches of these rejections, I decided to take a break from applying and instead build up my startup experience more by working at growth-stage startups, and just in general started focusing on my career as well. Fast forward a few years, and about a year ago YC reaches out to me (via automated email) saying they had identified me as being in the top X% on the Cofounder matching platform, and encouraged me to apply to their next batch cycle. I was reluctant to do so -- I hadn't been thinking too deeply about any new startup ideas in the past few months (so I'd most likely have to apply with a previous startup I had built), but after encouragement from friends and family I decided to take a chance anyways and apply once again. I went all out on the application -- I reached out to some YC friends and mentors to get their recommendations, and had them help me edit and perfect my application as well. I even traveled for a month to San Francisco, just so I could absorb more of the ecosystem, network with as many entrepreneurs as possible, and help give back to the community if I could. I submitted my application, waited for the fateful \"interview email\" day, and when that day came -- I got the standard \"...we're sorry, we're not going to move forward with your application\". I'll admit -- getting that email stung. I know looking back there were a lot of things I could have done better (e.g. not applying with the same idea as previous applications, among other things), and just like when I applied years ago, I knew that the chances of getting to the interview stage were slim to none. But yet somehow, that rejection hurt more than any of the others. reply sevagh 11 hours agoparentSorry to hear that experience. I've come to discount any form of flattery in intro emails.

The written applications forces you to articulate your ideas in a concise yet easy to understand way. And as much as YC doesn't recommend this, the mock YC interviews we did with alums was one of those most beneficial things that happened to us. Because so rarely will you get the opportunity to ask dozens of other YC founders to grill your business, and have 80%+ of them say yes.

What are the current fundraising terms you guys see for YC startups because the timing looks dicey for this cycle? NVDA just tanked 10% today and with it a whole bunch of AI valuations.

But from my perspective (FWIW) it's all sort of optimizing for the wrong thing. If you want to do a startup, YC is such a force multiplier that none of these details matter in the end. I do know that one reason the YC deal is far larger than it used to be is to give founders resilience against market ups and downs.

No requirement to intend to stay in the US – many foreign teams heading back, but many more haven chosen to stay in SF on O1 and other visas (YC helps with this).

A good example is Nubank, which is a cayman corp that does most of it's business in LatAm. The reason a company like this should not be a delaware c-corp is so that, in case of an acquisition of the companies assets, the holding company doesn't have to pay usa taxes (which is reasonable, since the company didn't have usa operations to begin with).

If you noticed any of these phrases in what I wrote: \"lack of credentials\", \"needn't look impressive\", \"doesn't look like\", \"nothing else\", \"out of nowhere\", \"you're already yourself\"...that's why I put all those in there.

As they always point out - like here in (2) - \"YC looks for good potential founders\" it must have been me (or us back then), not the project. reply outop 12 hours agoprevIt would be nice to be told roughly what the process is before having to 'sign up'. reply dang 12 hours agoparentYou're already signed up, because you can use your HN account to log in. (All YC accounts are HN accounts and vice versa.) The process is that you fill out a form and make a 1 minute video* and click 'submit'. (* I know...I hated the video thing too... but it gives a sense of what someone is like that doesn't come through in text, and you just talk for a minute about what you care about. nothing fancy.) (edit: also, if you're the type of founder that my post is trying to reach - the video is very much in your interest. Other people can see potential in you that you don't see in yourself, even after just a minute. Especially because the people reviewing applications have massive amounts of experience with this.) reply kxrm 10 hours agorootparentI just went through the application because of your post. I don't have a lot to bring to the table so hopes are not high but what's the worst that could happen? They say no. Anyway, I got hung up on the video, I definitely have no idea what to say, so I saved the application for later and will come back to it. Perhaps my plan for the video should be to read what I wrote in the plan fire it off and forget I did this. :) But yea, as someone who has issues with presenting to others visually in this way, the video requirement is really hard. I'll do it because this is all to see what happens, but definitely not confident on that part of things. reply dang 9 hours agorootparentI'm definitely on the side of everyone who hates the video thing but all you have to do is talk for a minute about what you're working on. You're not being evaluated on any of the things that \"video\" normally implies—quite the opposite. For example coming across as an \"influencer\" would be a bad idea, and coming across as an awkward introvert probably helps you and certainly won't hurt. But don't try to \"come across\" in any way at all—just talk about what you're working on or interested in. For people who feel the way that you and I both do, whoever watches your video as part of reviewing your YC application is probably going to see you an order of magnitude more positively than you see yourself. Self-evaluation of video is painful. reply mlhpdx 10 hours agorootparentprevSerious question: Does YC recognize and remediate the unconscious bias that comes with looking at said videos? It seems like it may be comforting, but potentially counter-productive. reply kxrm 10 hours agorootparentSo back in the day when Skype was still new tech and I worked for small remote company we did interviews over the phone. It was absolutely wonderful for eliminating bias. We had a very diverse cross section of employees from many backgrounds doing very good work for us. I kind of miss those days now that Zoom is everywhere and it's an expectation that you present yourself on video for others. I get why a sales job might want to make sure you keep up appearances but just writing code, I really hate turning on video. No one I know wants to acknowledge that we aren't solving bias with video though. I am glad you brought this up though. I believe it's true. reply ssroovy 11 hours agorootparentprevVideo is fine(it's just a minute), but why LinkedIn URL is required(not optional)? LinkedIn is about education, career, and networking.

Thanks for the reminder. reply dang 12 hours agoparentThat's the spirit :) But I can't count the number of times I've heard about YC saying 'we don't think it's a great idea, but we like the founders'. YC funds founders, that's the whole deal. It's hard for many people to believe this because it sounds too simple and it's counterintuitive in all kinds of ways. reply wizcaps 11 hours agoprevRe the “won’t get in” point.. We applied a few years ago. I won’t lie, I was sad and disappointed we didn’t get in, but even more so because our application was just ignored. Left a very bad taste in our mouths. I won’t again spend days on an application to have it be ignored. Since then, we have been grinding away at the same business and it’s now making 7 figures, giving us the perfect life of a 20% YoY growth business with no VCs breathing down our necks trying to 10x that growth rate. Not taking VC money was the best thing we ever did, albeit inadvertently. So sure, you won’t get in (statistically), but it could be the best thing you ever don’t do! reply tptacek 10 hours agoparentI spent most of the last 20 years in bootstrapped companies, helping grow two of them into 8 figures (which, when you don't have a board, is pretty neat). Bootstrapping is where my heart is, and almost all of the best memories of my career are from times when those kinds of companies were at the knife's edge of maybe having some kind of market fit and maybe just starting to have an identity and maybe just getting up on their legs. If that's your happy place --- again: it is mine! --- probably don't apply to YC. I'm at a company now (Fly.io, W20) that simply would not make sense without funding (we rack hardware all over the world). I've advised close friends through other startups that might could have worked without funding, but worked better with it. I've seen the before/after on YC, years into the life of some companies (Fly.io started in 2016) and the win was significant. It depends on what you're trying to do. But like, pretty obviously, the point Dan is trying to make here is that there are lots of people negotiating against themselves, talking themselves out of taking the swing. And I'm not all that great at business or whatever, but one thing I think I've learned is that overriding the instinct not to take swings, succumbing to the urge to avoid potential nociception, it's a pretty important tool in the toolbox of entrepreneurship. There are good reasons not to apply to YC, but \"they will probably reject me\" is maybe not one of them, unless your time is very scarce, in which case you probably already know why you're not applying to YC. reply nubela 1 hour agorootparentYou don't need YC to raise funds. reply dang 9 hours agoparentprev> our application was just ignored The only way that would happen is a bug. YC always responds to applicants. Rejections usually aren't personalized because that can't scale—but not hearing back at all should never happen. If you want me to look into what might have happened there, I'd be willing to try if you email hn@ycombinator.com. Congratulations on your success in any case!

Has anyone with the similar profile gotten into YC? and if so how did you make it work with all the legal blockades of h1b? reply dang 9 hours agoparentI'm no expert but I've been hanging around YC for a long time and have the consistent impression that when it comes to visa issues, something can nearly always be done. If I were you I'd just apply and mention in the form that you'll need help with this. If it's the kind of application YC would fund, they're not going to turn you down for this reason. reply anilmr 9 hours agorootparentthank you, I will take your advice and apply! reply dang 9 hours agorootparentGood luck! reply ganeshkrishnan 9 hours agoparentprevit's not their problem. If you have issues or any issues or they smell any issues, you will be rejected. Too many people take VC/YC personally but try to put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself if your startup would be worth it. Your answer will be their answer reply dang 9 hours agorootparentI couldn't disagree more! If anyone is feeling this way, please re-read my text at the top because the whole point is to convince you that YC might be a lot more interested than you'd assume. Look at it this way: if there's even a small chance that an application could lead to a major startup, would it make any sense for YC to reject it because of visa reasons (or similar)? Absolutely not. That would be how startup investors fail. On the contrary what would make sense is to fund it and then help get the obstacles overcome. This is a no-brainer and is one of the big ways that YC helps founders—not just about visa issues, but lots of other things - legal issues, cap table issues, prior investor issues, cofounder conflicts, god knows what else. reply ganeshkrishnan 8 hours agorootparentUnfortunately dang we will always be yin and yang (founders and vc/yc). If I have a thousand applications lying on my desk, my first task would be to remove everyone that has even the slightest issue. There is absolutely no way you would know who is going to be successful so your job is not to find the winners but get rid of the losers. Unfortunately VCs have a power over startups. Any startups they touch will have higher chance to succeed. And when the winds are strong even the chickens can fly so it's not that you choose the right startups, its just that the startups YC chooses become right. Not saying you are wrong but let's just agree to disagree ;) reply dang 8 hours agorootparent> your job is not to find the winners but get rid of the losers As I understand it, that's exactly backwards. The fatal mistake is not funding losers, it's missing winners. Certainly that's true of YC but it's well known among investors generally.

Back cover copy An Introduction to Programming by the Inventor of C++ Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, Third Edition, will help anyone who is willing to work hard learn the fundamental principles of programming and develop the practical skills needed for programming in the real world. Previous editions have been used successfully by many thousands of students. This revised and updated edition Assumes that your aim is to eventually write programs that are good enough for others to use and maintain Focuses on fundamental concepts and techniques, rather than on obscure language-technical details Is an introduction to programming in general, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, rather than just an introduction to a programming language Covers both contemporary high-level techniques and the lower-level techniques needed for efficient use of hardware Will give you a solid foundation for writing useful, correct, type-safe, maintainable, and efficient code Is primarily designed for people who have never programmed before, but even seasoned programmers have found previous editions useful as an introduction to more effective concepts and techniques Covers a wide range of essential concepts, design and programming techniques, language features, and libraries Uses contemporary C++ (C++20 and C++23) Covers the design and use of both built-in types and user-defi ned types, complete with input, output, computation, and simple graphics/GUI Offers an introduction to the C++ standard library containers and algorithms ABOUT THE AUTHOR Bjarne Stroustrup is the designer and original implementer of C++, as well as the author of The C++ Programming Language and A Tour of C++, and many popular and academic publications. He is a professor of Computer Science at Columbia University in New York City. Dr. Stroustrup is a member of the US National Academy of Engineering, and an IEEE, ACM, and CHM fellow. He received the 2018 Charles Stark Draper Prize, the IEEE Computer Society's 2018 Computer Pioneer Award, and the 2017 IET Faraday Medal. informit.com/aw informit.com/series/indepth stroustrup.com/Programming Pearson, Addison-Wesley ISBN 978-0-13-830868-1 PPP3 \"Programming: Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd Edition)\", aka PPP3, is an introduction to programming for people who have never programmed before. It will also be useful for people who have programmed a bit and want to improve their style and technique - or simply learn modern C++. It is designed for classroom use, but written with an eye on self study. Ealier versions of this book have been used as the basis for first programming classes for electrical engineering, computer engineering, and computer science students at Texas A&M University and in many other places. People who have seen PPP2 will notice that PPP3 is about half its size. What I have done to keep the weight down is to strengthen the foundational chapters usually covered in a one-semester course, utilizing key parts of C++20 and C+23, and re-basing the Graphics/GUI chapter code on Qt for portability (e.g., to browsers and phones). placed the more specialized chapers (known as \"broadening the view\" in PPP2) on the Web for people to use as needed. See below. eliminate the pure reference material. You now can find more and more up-to-date material on the web, e.g. cppreference.com. The supporting material for PPP2 is available as ever (lecture slides, code, etc.). Here are some PPP3 samples Preface. What the book promises, and what it does not promise. Table of Contents. Chapter 0: Notes to the Reader. Some notes on the approach taken by the book. Chapter 10: A Display Model. A sample chapter. If you are a real novice, don't read this chapter quite yet. I post it to show teachers and more experienced readers where the book gets to in the 5th week or so (assuming two chapters a week). Also, to show off a little bit of contemporary C++. Supporting information Links to C++ implementations and Software Development Environments (and a little advice on getting started). How to use modules? including an explanation of how to build module PPP using PPP_support.h. module PPP for when you can use modules. header \"PPP.h\" for the easiest use of modules std and PPP. header \"PPPheaders.h\" for when you have to fall back to using header files. GUI support including PPP3's Graphics/GUI user interface library (from chapters 10-14). To run this code you need to install Qt. Note The User Manual.

Writing this on a debian machine, and trying \"g++ --std=c++23 -fmodules-ts\" does not work, and from https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/23 looks like the \"paper\" for this is P2465R3, for which clang++ 17 has \"partial support\". I apt installed clang++17, and it still didn't work, complaining \"module 'std' not found\" I understand that \"import std;\" is a very new feature and not \"finalized\" or whatever, but this book is supposed to be for beginners to C++; I wonder how the average beginner would react to that? (I found the same thing a year or two ago when reading \"Tour of C++\") reply adrian_b 4 hours agoparentThe current gcc documentation (13.2.1) says: \"_Standard Library Header Units_ The Standard Library is not provided as importable header units. If you want to import such units, you must explicitly build them first. If you do not do this with care, you may have multiple declarations, which the module machinery must merge--compiler resource usage can be affected by how you partition header files into header units.\" So for now any \"import\" can work only if one writes appropriate module files first. Nevertheless, I do not expect that the updating of the standard C++ library of gcc will take a long time, so later this new book will become directly usable as it is. For someone who already knows older C++ and just wants to update their knowledge, writing the corresponding module files can be a good learning experience in itself. reply randomname93857 9 hours agoparentprevwould this help with your problem with modules, it's referenced on the book's page: https://www.stroustrup.com/module_use.html ? reply humanrebar 11 hours agoparentprevAt this point, it's not realistic to maintain interesting C++ programs without a build system. That being said, I expect the specific g++ example you provide will end up working with some special casing in the compiler, at least eventually, when someone submits patches to GCC to get it to work. But mostly, it's not realistic to directly wire up calls to g++ anymore outside of research examples. Note that other compiled languages use systems like gobuild, cargo, Maven, etc. instead of fiddling with gccgo, rustc, javac, etc. directly. https://www.kitware.com/import-std-in-cmake-3-30/ reply billforsternz 9 hours agorootparentI think your point is orthogonal to OP's point. I agree with him, the first chapter of a book about a programming language should include hello world and it should ruthlessly minimise barriers to the broadest range of possible readers being able to try that out. They can then supplement their reading with active experimentation, a vital step.

A far greater sin, especially in the eyes of Stroustrup, is disabling exceptions reply justin66 12 hours agorootparentprevHe's name-dropped CopperSpice in some of his speeches, so he's certainly aware that it's not universally adored. reply pjmlp 18 hours agoparentprevFor the better, with Qt there is QtCreator. reply spacechild1 17 hours agorootparentNot sure what you are trying to say here. Qt, the library, and QtCreator, the IDE, are completely separate products. You can use QtCreator without Qt and vice versa. Now, I'm pretty sure you know that, hence my confusion... reply Kranar 14 hours agorootparentQt Creator makes working with Qt a heck of a lot easier in a way that working with Visual Studio or vim does not. It comes with an integrated Qt form designer, Quick Designer for QML, supports Qt's moc syntax out of the box, integrated support for Qt Test Integration, native support for Qt Assistant and documentation and integration with Qt's internationalization tools. The idea that \"QtCreator\" is some totally independent IDE that just coincidentally happens to have the letters Qt at the beginning in the same way that Java and JavaScript are independent of one another, but otherwise has no relationship to Qt the library is just patently absurd HN pedantry. reply spacechild1 8 hours agorootparent> that just coincidentally happens to have the letters Qt at the beginning That's not what I was trying to say. I just thought it's worth pointing out that QtCreator is really a general-purpose C++ IDE. (It's my favourite C++ IDE, btw.) reply Kranar 8 hours agorootparentIt can be a general-purpose C++ IDE and also very tightly coupled to Qt at the same time. Visual Studio is also a general-purpose C++ IDE and yet I don't think anyone would say it's independent of Windows. reply earthnail 17 hours agorootparentprevQtCreator helps with the learning curve as it‘s a very accessible IDE.

I'm wondering if that's because it's cross platform or that there's more code out there using SFML that these models got trained on? SFML seems relatively recent compared to Qt or even FLTK, so it seems kind of odd that there would be more SFML training data. It also seems odd that all 4 were in agreement here that SFML should be used for graphics in a C++ program. reply forgotpwd16 16 hours agorootparentSFML is a graphical library but not a GUI framework/toolkit that Qt/FLTK are. reply swatcoder 16 hours agorootparentprevSFML is more accessible for lightweight/exploratory/educational use, and so I wouldn't be surprised if it appears more often in training data associated with those simple \"let's learn\" sized projects. reply chuckadams 17 hours agoprevKnow what I like about Stroustrup's code? \"using namespace std;\". The typical convention of sticking std:: in front of std::every std::last std::bloody std::thing drives me std::insane. reply HarHarVeryFunny 16 hours agoparentIt depends ... You should NEVER have \"using namespace\" (for any namespace) in a header file, since that is how you create name clashes, which is what the namespaces are there to avoid. I don't personally like \"using namespace std;\" even in implementations, since I think it makes code less readable, and the contents of std:: is so large, and growing, that I'd again prefer to just avoid the possibility of name clashes. We write code once, but read it many times, so shorter names (incl. namespaces) seems like a poor efficiency choice. reply Kranar 14 hours agorootparent>We write code once, but read it many times, so shorter names (incl. namespaces) seems like a poor efficiency choice. I think it's fascinating how different people can interpret this so differently. I feel like it's precisely because we read code so much more than we write it that we should prefer using names that get to the point, instead of having so much noise and repetitive boilerplate. Reading a soup of std::this, std::that, std::foo, std::bar is so difficult to parse through. Especially if you're like me and you sound things out in your head, which I recently learned is not how everyone reads. The only justification for writing all those std::'s is because compilers can't disambiguate names from their context, but you're not going to find a human who comes across a use of vector, or sort(...) and throw their hands up in confusion wondering what was meant. >We write code once, but read it many times, so shorter names (incl. namespaces) seems like a poor efficiency choice. This to me seems like a cargo cult justification, where you've heard the argument that descriptive names are helpful for readability, so we should name our variables in a way that conveys their intention as opposed to 1 letter names or obfuscated abbreviations, but instead of genuinely understanding the principle behind the rule, you think the rule is simply that it's better to have long names over short names. Descriptive names that can be used to disambiguate variables from one another on the basis of their purpose... yes, please do that. Writing long names just so that they are long, especially by giving everything a shared prefix like std::... no, that's a misunderstanding of the justification behind the rule. It's similar to that saying along the lines of when a principle becomes a metric, it ceases to be a useful principle. reply HarHarVeryFunny 12 hours agorootparent> This to me seems like a cargo cult justification, where you've heard the argument ... Well, no, I've been a professional programmer since 1982, and a hobbyist one both before then and to this day. I might be wrong, but these are the lessons I've learnt over the decades working on a variety of projects of different size and durations ... Of course consise code is nice, and while you're in the heat of development it's easy to pretty much memorize an entire codebase, even a large one, but it's when you have to come back to it years later, and barely even recognize the code as your own, that you'll be happy it's self-documenting. Now, on a large team that \"future self\" may just be the new hire, or the guy who replaces you when you quit ... reply Kranar 12 hours agorootparentI am not saying you are cargo cult programming, but being a cargo cult programmer has nothing to do with seniority. There are plenty of people who have been programming for decades who blindly follow rules because that's how they learned things, that's what they were taught is good practice, and they never bothered to question it, reflect on it, and they go along with it because of cultural reasons rather than because they have a genuine understanding of the principles. >I might be wrong, but these are the lessons I've learnt over the decades working on a variety of projects of different size and durations ... But what lesson did you learn? That long names are better than short names, which is what I called cargo cult programming and an instance of mixing up the metric for the principle? Or did you instead learn that descriptive names are better than non-descriptive names? If it's that long names are better than short names, then by all means continue using std:: everywhere. If instead it's that descriptive names that communicate purpose or intention or actual information are better than non-descriptive names, then having a bunch of std:: everywhere doesn't do much of anything to help readability, it just adds noise. Now people can and do justify the use of std:: but I've never heard it on the basis of making code more readable. There is nothing self documenting about a bunch of names that all share a common prefix. And this doesn't even touch on how ironic it is that std is itself non-descriptive jargon that is an abbreviation of standard, but I am almost certain that if everyone had to liter their codebase with standard:: everywhere, no one would think twice about what the right thing to do is. reply HarHarVeryFunny 11 hours agorootparent> But what lesson did you learn?

I am also principled in critiquing an argument and never critiquing a person. I said that the advice you gave is a form of cargo culting, but I also said in the very first sentence that \"I am not saying you are cargo cult programming\". I don't think there is anything wrong with getting into the subtleties of whether the advice is what you originally said it was, which is that longer names are better than shorter names, or whether the advice you learned was that descriptive names are better than non-descriptive names. I think the subtlety between those two statements is not being appreciated and without a clear distinction other people may read that advice and take away the wrong conclusion. Take care. reply HarHarVeryFunny 8 hours agorootparent> which is that longer names are better than shorter names, or whether the advice you learned was that descriptive names are better than non-descriptive names Are you even a developer? In the programming world \"longer names\" is universally understood (except apparently by you) to mean \"longer due to being more descriptive\". NOBODY thinks that making identifier names longer just for the hell of it beneficial. It's as if a chess player is describing to you the importance of controlling the center of the board, and you are wondering out load if they mean controlling it by clamping it to the table. Perhaps you think suggestions like this make you sound smart. They don't. reply Kranar 8 hours agorootparentWhich is why that advice confuses the metric for the principle. This is your exact quote: \"We write code once, but read it many times, so shorter names (incl. namespaces) seems like a poor efficiency choice.\" And the point being made is that there are cases where shorter names are actually more readable than longer names and one of those cases is when every name shares a common prefix. By prefixing everything with something common code becomes more uniform, and names become less distinctive and consequently less readable because it's harder to identify and differentiate sections of code. Code ends up looking like a soup of std::s everywhere. It would be like a chess player who only tries to control the center because someone told them that controlling the center is important, but then repeatedly loses to the King's Indian Defense [1] because they never took the time to fundamentally understand why the center is important and so they don't realize how the King's Indian Defense is used precisely to destabilize the center of the board with sharp angles of attack. They just blindly apply what they hear... and let me tell you there are plenty of mediocre chess players who do just that. In almost any field from programming to chess to sports, you can find guidelines and good rules of thumb and I do not want to discourage people from knowing those rules because having heuristics certainly improves productivity. But don't ever let those rules become dogma; at some point it's worth understanding what the principles behind those rules are, when do they apply and when don't they apply. >Are you even a developer? Note that you keep trying to make this discussion personal whereas I have kept this discussion about the topic and the argument. I would respectfully ask you to do the same, let's discuss the topic and avoid making this personal. It's irrelevant how long you've been programming for or how long I've been programming for or even if I am a programmer at all. Trying to justify arguments on the basis of who you are or who I am is a poor way to go about engineering best practices. What matters is whether your points can be justified.

If code I write today has a class called bubble_sorter, and then one day, the C++ standard library decides to add std::bubble_sorter, then: 1. If I had \"using namespace std;\" then all of my code is suddenly broken. 2. If I didn't have it, I'm fine. Also, and this is just personal preference, but I simply like to be able to clearly distinguish when my code is calling into the standard library. Typing in that short \"std::\" reminds me that I am calling into someone else's code. reply wakawaka28 8 hours agorootparent>If I had \"using namespace std;\" then all of my code is suddenly broken. If this happened and if you included that specific header, you would get a simple compiler error due to ambiguous methods. Then you can simply add a namespace somewhere and move on. I know sometimes this can involve a lot of changes (if we're talking about other `using namespace ...` usage) but in general you're not gonna have problems. If you're really worried about this, you can move the statement closer to where you need it. This is very helpful for dense code that you normally want to be verbose. reply culi 16 hours agorootparentprevConversely, We write code once, but read it many times, so longer names seems like a poor efficiency choice. reply HarHarVeryFunny 16 hours agorootparentWhat's the logic of that though? Longer more descriptive names (self-documenting code) help readability, not hinder it. Certainly time to enter code (which is increasingly going to be automated) should be the last consideration - if we're considering full software lifecycle then coding probably takes up some small single-digit percentage of the time we're interacting with the code. reply nuancebydefault 14 hours agorootparentLonger names are harder to read. Think about any math formula. Does energy=mass * math::powerf(speed_of_light, 2) read more fluently? Context matters. Make sure the context is ways clear and code is written there where it belongs. Then names can be shorter while being readable. reply HarHarVeryFunny 12 hours agorootparentI'm not sure that's a great example. Of course e = mc^2 is so iconic and well known that most people know it, and will probably even perceive it as a whole. Once you recognize it then no need to explain what e, m and c are. However, most code is not that obvious, and in the real world you're probably not looking at one mystery line of code who's function becomes obvious by context - you are more likely looking at entire functions or blocks of code, maybe without comments, trying to figure out what is going on. Try inheriting 10K of mostly undocumented code, and then you'd probably be a lot more grateful that the original author used descriptive names and comments, even though he knew what it all meant when he wrote it. reply zengid 15 hours agoparentprevI hear that once c++ modules lands this shouldn't be controversial anymore, right? reply winwang 16 hours agoparentprevYep, although I do like not having clashing names.

C, Lisp, Rust, Python, Ada, Go, Java, C#, ... They all require you to qualify conflicting names if some other characteristics (for instance the number or types of arguments) don't provide enough information, or outright don't permit it (C, since it has no notion of name spaces). Can you point to the \"every other language[s]\" which have solved this problem? reply Kranar 6 hours agorootparentMost languages you mention let you import the individual names that you want, and you can resolve potential clashes at the point of import. In C++ you basically ```#include``` a file and with it comes a flood of names that are often times unpredictable. reply Jtsummers 4 hours agorootparentC++ has had namespaces for a very long time (since the beginning? not sure, I wasn't using computers when it was created), just like those other languages. The name collision issue that it has is the same as them. And with those C++ namespaces you can do `using some_namespace::some_specific_name;`. Which resolves the issue just like in those other languages. reply chuckadams 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's certainly not every other language, but Unison has a novel approach to solving the problem of name clashes: function names are just local aliases for a content hash of the function's AST. Compiling involves replacing function names with those hashes, and putting the names back is a matter of pretty-printing. I'm sure there's an arsenal of footguns lurking in Unison's system, but for sure it opens up interesting opportunities (distributed code becomes \"grab this function out of cache\"). reply Jtsummers 12 hours agorootparentDoes that actually solve name clashes? If I have two functions compiled at the same time: def foo(n): return n + 2 def foo(n): return n * 2 foo(3) # which one is called? (I don't know Unison syntax so using Python for the example) It's still a name clash at compile time. reply chuckadams 12 hours agorootparentTBH I've only dipped my toe into Unison, but I don't believe it would let you re-bind the same identifier in the same scope in the same compilation unit. It's more that `foo(3)` becomes a call to the hashed version `#e0ca5f(3)` forevermore. Once a function has been compiled, it doesn't care what the names of any functions it uses are afterward, until you explicitly recompile them to use the new names. So it really has more to do with preventing versioning conflicts ... others can explain it much better than me, sorry. reply tylerchurch 9 hours agorootparentprevIf C++ was JavaScript you would do: import {vector} from 'std'; Which I think is a reasonable compromise, you're only bringing vector into scope rather than all of the standard library. reply Jtsummers 4 hours agorootparentC++: using std::vector; https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/namespace#Using-d... reply pif 17 hours agoparentprevYou learned to program on Windows, didn't you? reply chuckadams 13 hours agorootparentI learned on C on Unix.

No, I haven't tried any of those either. No, I'm not going to. Turning specifically to Rust, I don't use it for scripting because it's not what I look for in a scripting language. It's compiled; I look for a language that doesn't have that extra step. It has the borrow checker; I don't write scripting code that needs that level of discipline and care. In fact, most of my scripting is of the form \"pick some bits out of a text file\". For that, Perl is my tool of choice. Sure, other languages have regexes.

The other quite annoying thing is that the docs are extremely badly organised so Google rarely points you directly at what you want. Instead you get stuff like w3schools which is trash, but much better organised. Also annoying that the docs still don't include types. I would use Typescript (via Deno), Go or Rust instead.

I once heard that the C++ language contains 4 components: the first catalog is \"C\", the second is for OOP, the third is for productivity and flexibility such as stl and templates, and the last one is for special cases such as volatile, asm, etc. He then recommends to use catalog 1 with care, and avoid scenarios that one has to use catalog 4. Does that make sense? reply Night_Thastus 18 hours agorootparentI started off writing C++ this way, basically writing it like it was C89. This is fine if you do not plan to share your work with others, but it's not well-written C++. It will bite you later on. It's best to learn the C++ way of doing things. It will save you so much time and headache. Don't use character arrays, use strings. Don't use C arrays, use std::vector or std::array. Don't write your own lists or sets, use std::list/set or std::unordered_list/set. Don't use strcat when std::string operator + exists. Etc. I personally rarely use smart pointers or make_shared/make_unique these days. I just don't need pointers. Most of the time allocation can be done without them, and when I need to pass things around I use references. There are exceptions for C APIs for cross-platform/cross-compiler work, of course. And sometimes library code needs it, ofc. The STL andare your friend. They solve so many problems in a very elegant way. Learning them should be a priority. I'd go easy on the OOP elements unless you know OOP programming very well. Just using classes as containers for data and functions is more than fine for C++ most of the time. Writing your own templates can be a bit of a footgun until you understand them. Feel free to put that off awhile. Don't mess with volatile and asm unless you are 100% sure that what you're doing needs it. Also: Be cautious with use of auto. A bit here and there is fine, but too much and code can become unreadable. C++ is a typed language for a reason. reply hedora 18 hours agorootparentIn particular, you don't need volatile unless you're writing hardware device drivers. If you're doing that, then you also need to understand the semantics of the memory mappings of the I/O pages you're writing. You also need to know about bus ordering and request coalescing guarantees for PCIe (or AXI, or whatever your embedded system uses). If that paragraph doesn't make any sense, and you think you need volatile then there are basically two possibilities: You're writing a Java program (which uses that keyword for something else), or you need std::atomic (or __sync_* for C) instead. reply gpderetta 18 hours agorootparent> (or __sync_* for C) Actually even C has _Atomic these days! reply HarHarVeryFunny 17 hours agorootparentprev> Be cautious with use of auto. A bit here and there is fine, but too much and code can become unreadable. Yes, although one place where \"auto\" should almost always be used is to declare iterators (not that one should be needing them so much nowadays), and I think harmless for range-based for loops \"for (auto i : v)\" although as you say there's definitely a convenience/readability trade off. reply HarHarVeryFunny 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, roughly so. 1) The major part of C to avoid is raw pointers and malloc, and generally anything where C++ has a more modern alternative. Don't use C datastructures (pointers, strings, arrays) where C++ replacements exist (smart pointers, std:string, std::array and std::vector, etc), or use C libraries where C++ replacements exist (e.g. C++ std::string vs C's string.h). Of course you can't avoid all of C, since the syntax of C++ is an extension of C. 2) I wouldn't characterize what C++ adds to C as OOP. OOP is a design methodology, whereas the main addition C++ gives you is classes which are better thought of just as powerful and convenient type of data structure. The core feature of classes you always want to use are constructors and destructors. Any initialization of the class's data members should be done in the constructor (don't leave things uninitialized), and any final cleanup (releasing memory or locks, closing files, etc) should be put in the destructor so that it always happens (even if your program throws exceptions). Don't feel that just because classes support subclassing, polymorphism (virtual methods), etc, that you should be using them. They are there in case you need them, but if in doubt don't. 3a) The STL is just the standard library for C++. You should always be using STL data structures (std::string, std::list, std::vector, std::map, etc) when applicable - not just \"for productivity\". 3b) Templates (template classes, constructors/methods, functions) are not needed for most everyday use of C++. They are there for library writers, and on occasion for writing your own class and libraries. Think of them a bit like class inheritence - they are there in case you need them, but not something you should be reaching for unless there is no better way. 4) C++ has a LOT of stuff (esp. libraries) that might be considered as \"for special case use only\". A rookie mistake might be to think that C++ has all this stuff - I should be using it! In general you should ignore the obscure stuff, and only use it when some special circumstance requires it. reply tialaramex 16 hours agorootparentAlthough Microsoft refers to their implementation of the standard library as the STL (and this is convenient naming, since one of its most important maintainers is STL, Stephan T. Lavavej) actually the STL and the C++ standard library aren't the same thing. The Standard Template Library is Alexander Stepanov's generic programming achieved via the relatively new (at the time) C++ Templates feature. At this point (the late 1980s through early 1990s) Generic Programming is an obscure academic idea, it's not how normal software works. Stepanov is persuaded to present his library to WG21 (\"the committee\") in 1993 and their work is eventually standardised as C++ 98 a few years later. The most important part of the STL is the algorithms, generic algorithms are an amazing idea. The collections, eh, they're nothing to write home about, there are a dozen takes on the iterator problem with different trade-offs, but this idea of generic algorithms unlocks so much power and that's why lots of languages grew generics or for new languages had them on day one. reply HarHarVeryFunny 15 hours agorootparentSure, but that's really more of a historical perspective. The STL is still there as part of the standard library, although basically just the containers portion. It's been so long since I used the original standalone (SGI) version of the STL, that I can't even recall exactly what was in it other than containers and iterators (any algorithms?). reply hedora 18 hours agorootparentprevThese days, OO programing is mostly frowned upon. OO added the idea of implementation inheritance to interfaces, and that's mostly a bad idea. Newer languages and modern C++ favor composition instead. You define interfaces that provide some well-defined capability, and then you write things that wrap the interfaces to provide additional functionality. In C++ you can use templates to do this without any runtime overhead. In C, you can either use preprocessor macros (ouch) or you can build your own vtables. The vtable approach adds virtual method invocations all over the place, so it's not zero cost. The C++ approach actually isn't zero-cost either: You can end up having many copies of the same template logic, which blows up your instruction cache. One of the big innovations of swift was to avoid that. As far as I know, Rust macros and \"go generate\" produce binaries that are closer to the C++ approach. Anyway, especially for emulators, you should look into getting good with C++ template meta programming, or just learn rust and then use its implementation of generics. Both approaches will let the compiler inline the heck out of stuff that ends up in the inner loop. In particular, clang + gcc are both good at constant propagation. One problem with jumping straight from C to rust is that you basically have to already be able to write stable C++ code in order to get it to compile at all. The borrow checker moves subtle but common C++ errors from runtime to compile time. If you have a lot of experience with C already, the jump might be OK. (edit: I should add that C++ isn't standing still, and there are lots of cool efforts to backport the good ideas from Rust to it. Systems language competition is a good thing, and they're my two favorite languages!) reply jcelerier 17 hours agorootparent> You can end up having many copies of the same template logic, which blows up your instruction cache. linkers have been able to perform identical-code-folding optimizations for a few decades now reply Jtsummers 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ Without having to squint, 12 of those languages are easily categorized as OO languages. Given the mindshare of those 12 languages, I don't think it makes sense to say that \"OO programming is mostly frowned upon.\" [emphasis added] Maybe it's frowned upon by some, maybe even many, but if it's mostly frowned upon then a lot of people must hate their work. reply bmoxb 15 hours agorootparentThey are, if I'm understanding correctly, referring to what may be considered the 'traditional' OOP style (Animal, which has various properties and behaviours, is extended by Dog, which has its own properties and behaviours, maybe overriding those of Animal) vs a style where inheritance is use primarily to define and implement interfaces (i.e., an expected set of behaviours with no implementation included in the base class). In other words, the different ways a language supporting OOP may be used rather than what the language supports in and of itself. reply m_nyongesa 16 hours agorootparentprevDo you have a recommended link to a book or tutorial that teaches one how to do composition rather than inheritance in C++ (the way you are describing)? Thank you in advance! reply AnimalMuppet 16 hours agorootparentprev> These days, OO programing is mostly frowned upon. Only in certain circles. For the software world as a whole, \"mostly\" is rather an overstatement. (For that matter, for the software world as a whole, \"mostly\" is an overstatement no matter what claim follows the \"mostly\".) > OO added the idea of implementation inheritance to interfaces, and that's mostly a bad idea. There is more than one flavor of OO. Not all of them support implementation inheritance. You're using a feature of a sub-part to complain about the whole. (In fairness, though, this is a thread about C++...) Current best practice is \"prefer composition over inheritance\". There are places, though, where inheritance is the correct answer. When you hit those places, use it. Where it's not, don't use it. reply Thorrez 19 hours agoparentprevI get a 404 reply Jtsummers 19 hours agorootparentFrom https://www.icce.rug.nl/ I got https://fbb-git.gitlab.io/cppannotations/, which does work. reply repelsteeltje 19 hours agorootparentLink works for me (firefox 125), but only if I use http (port 80), port 443 get me 404 not found as well. reply Jtsummers 19 hours agorootparentAh, you're right.

If you want to work on your \"hairy c++ application\" you'll benefit from understanding how \"modern c++\" it is (and what your toolchain supports). Meyer's effective books are good with two caveats: first, they are really meant to improve practice for people who are already working in the language (e.g. don't do it that way, and here's why). Second, the older ones are now dated and some advice need updating to work with newer language spec.

There is no other option in the foreseeable future as the investment needed to rewrite (if you can find the people) is in the $100's of billions. So you will need to know C++ if we want to be the cutting edge and need extreme performance. On the other hand, if you don't need these \"hard-core\" features then any language will do. In fact, most of these have Python or other language interfaces so you don't need to know much C++. reply tialaramex 17 hours agorootparent> So you will need to know C++ if we want to be the cutting edge and need extreme performance. I would suggest a better phrasing might be that you should learn C++ if you want to cling to existing software in the state it is today, certain that history ended yesterday and the future is just the same forever from here on. You won't get \"extreme performance\" from C++ because it is buried under the weight of decades of compatibility hacks. reply CyberDildonics 16 hours agorootparentI don't even know what you are trying to say here. C++ is great to program in and has a fantastic eco system of tools and libraries. It is something you can safely base a business around. You won't get \"extreme performance\" from C++ because it is buried under the weight of decades of compatibility hacks. This doesn't even make sense. What is an example of something that can't be fast because it is done in C++? What \"compatibility hacks\" are slowing programs down? This does not sound like something someone with experience in C++ would say. reply tialaramex 10 hours agorootparent> This doesn't even make sense. What is an example of something that can't be fast because it is done in C++? What \"compatibility hacks\" are slowing programs down? Let's look at two very different perf leaks in ISO C++. Firstly move assignment which is right at the heart of the language. Initially C++ doesn't have move semantics at all, which is a problem because in a bunch of cases that's key to \"extreme performance\". So in the \"lost decade\" period between C++ 03 and C++ 11 considerable work was done to figure out a way to unlock this, but of course C++ insisted on backwards compatibility with the code written for C++ 98 with no such semantic. The result is that the actual move semantic people wanted can't quite be done, this is now called \"destructive move\" and proponents of the compatible option C++ 11 and later had claim it's equivalent to the move they delivered, plus delete. But that's... disingenuous. The C++ 11 move is actually (move + create), so to build \"destructive move\", when that's what you need, you must write (move + create) + destroy. Sometimes the compiler can see what's happening here and emit the same machine code you'd get in a language with native move semantics, but sometimes it has no way to figure this out, and you're emitting move + create + destroy, which is markedly slower as well as of course being more error prone. Secondly right up at the surface, where we can feel the rain, and appropriately something Bjarne Stroustrup (author of the book we're talking about here) has noticed himself, the provided growable array, std::vector lacks the bifurcated reservation. Vec::reserve_exact isn't enough, you need Vec::reserve as well for good performance with a growable array API, but C++ doesn't provide this, it provides only Vec::reserve_exact under the name \"reserve\" and there's no room to offer both in the compatible API, which means as a user/ application programmer this fundamental type is a small perf leak. Bjarne shrugs this off, oh well, just don't use the reserve API to get performance benefits. But everybody else can do so, this choice means C++ is leaving it on the table for somebody else with a better growable array type. Finally though, I want to look at a beacon over the horizon, where \"extreme performance\" really is something they're thinking about. Iterator Loops (sometimes \"Chunk Loops\") are a technique where the language lets you directly express in your definition of a loop how it can be performed in a SIMD-fashion, so e.g. you write the code to search an N byte buffer for the byte you're looking for, but then revisit that loop and also write code for searching N=M*16 bytes, using 16 bytes at once. This lets you write, in a high level language, code which will be easy for a compiler to SIMD accelerate without fragile idiom recognition. C++ of course does not provide Iterator Loops and instead you'd reach for manual inline assembler in these cases today. reply _gabe_ 4 hours agorootparentIn addition to what CyberDildonics already said, C++ is also an (almost) superset of C. You can also inline assembly. If you find particular hot loops that need to be optimized at any point while profiling, it’s trivial to drop down levels of the stack to get the extreme performance you may need. There is no FFI needed in C++ to drop down a level. There is no barrier at all. You can write your code directly for the CPU, inline it into your code, and fine tune it as much as you want. I don’t know how that wouldn’t qualify as extreme performance. reply CyberDildonics 10 hours agorootparentprevWho is filling your head with all this? I have never seen any program slow down over a move, because you should be moving enough data that copying a pointer doesn't matter anyway. This is trivial stuff. Show me in an actual program somewhere that shows what you're talking about. Vec::reserve_exact isn't enough, you need Vec::reserve Reserve reserves the amount that you give it. This isn't hard or complicated. What exactly do you think it should do differently, and how hard would it be to write your own? Vector is a simple data structure. Anything you don't like about it isn't a language limitation. this fundamental type is a small perf leak Show me a program that illustrates what you are talking about. I want to look at a beacon over the horizon, You can do this with intrinsics or libraries that use intrinsics. the language lets you directly express in your definition of a loop This isn't a performance limitation it's a convenience you want integrated into the language. There is one that does this, it's called ISPC. Is that what you use? This seems to me like you've gone down some sort of anti C++ rabbit hole where people who don't know what they're doing get worked up about things that don't matter. Meanwhile in the standard library there is actually the unordered_map design which is stifled by algorithmic complexity requirements, but people use flat maps to get around that. reply slekker 16 hours agorootparentprevA more extreme version of this would be COBOL right? Even if people stopped writing C++ today the amount of code that's already written will last many lifetimes. reply tialaramex 16 hours agorootparentSure, I do not advise people to go learn COBOL either. In fact, I never learned COBOL, they were writing COBOL at the first place I \"worked\" as a teenager† and it was clearly not the future. † in the UK there was a discrepancy between what happens to the sort of teenager who exhibits talent and interest in an area like writing software, who is sent to just watch adults doing that and mostly doesn't do any actual work themselves as \"Work Shadowing\", versus those whose direction seems more... manual who are expected to actually go do stuff in the same period, supervised by adults of course, but still very much doing the actual work, \"Work Experience\". This seems very obviously unfair, although of course as the teenager who wasn't expected to actually do much I wasn't complaining at the time... reply boppo1 10 hours agorootparentWhat is the future? reply jandrewrogers 15 hours agoparentprevThere are still some high-performance software domains where (modern) C++ is unambiguously the best tool for the job. Database engines are a good example of this, they pervasively break the compiler's understanding of object lifetimes which requires flexibility in the language that C++ can explicitly express in an ergonomic way. No one learns all of C++, you just need to learn the bits that are useful for the kinds of applications you write. If, for example, you are building database kernels then you are unlikely to use any of the STL containers (even std::array and std::vector are infrequent) in most of the code. However, you will need to know how to manually fix-up object lifetimes using semi-obscure language features you would never need to know about for most server apps. If you stay within a relatively narrow application domain, the useful parts of C++ for that domain crystallize pretty readily in my experience, which is much easier to learn. reply spacechild1 17 hours agoparentprevI started because I became interested in graphics and audio programming.

    "originBody": "Tips on how to structure your home directory Published on 2023-09-04. Modified on 2023-09-07. Someone wrote me an email and asked if I could share some tips on how to structure the $HOME directory, so here we go. Structuring or organizing directories is not much different from structuring or organizing other stuff and it really comes down to what makes the most sense to you - at least as long as you're only dealing with your own directories. As soon as you're dealing with an organization, things can very quickly get out of hand. The main purpose behind any kind of organizing is efficiency. That really is the keyword. You need to be able to easily and quickly find what you're looking for and just as easily and quickly be able to store what needs to be stored. Over the years I have changed my directory structure for my home directory a couple of times, but not so for about the last 10+ years because I have settled on something that works really well for me. I don't like clutter and I try to keep things simple. If I need some kind of rule book in order to remember how to store my files in my home directory, then this is a clear sign that something has gone wrong. In my home directory I have all the basic hidden stuff which is a part of any modern Unix operating system such as .config, .aliases, .profile, .gnupg, .mozilla, etc. Though I would prefer that all applications would respect the XDG_CONFIG_HOME, which defaults to $HOME/.config, I don't mess with that and generally don't care too much about that. In the past I kept my $HOME in Git - the right way ;), which is a really great way to organize dotfiles. Today I still put all my dotfiles in Git because I like to keep a history of changes, but I only leave those dotfiles in place which work identically across the different systems I use. The setup specific dotfiles is kept in a \"dotfiles\" directory and I then use symlinks (more about that in a little while). Regarding normal files and directories I primarily use two methods of organizing, namely \"category\" and \"dates\". This is my basic directory structure: bin data edata mnt usr/dotfiles Besides from the above, I just leave the Desktop and Downloads directories, which different applications seem to want to shove down the throat of everybody. In the past I \"fought\" against those, because I generally don't use them and I don't like them, but life is just too short to mess with crap like that. Update 2023-09-04: You can set directories such as Desktop, Downloads and others with the user-dirs.dirs - settings for XDG user dirs, which most applications should respect (thanks Hugo for pointing this out!) In the bin directory I keep my shell scripts and personal binary executables (not stuff installed via the package manager). The mnt directory I use for different mount points, like when I mount an SD card, a USB disk, some of the shared storage I use in my homelab. It looks something like this: mnt \\foo \\bar \\baz I never auto mount, but generally use shell scripts for mounting. So if I have a USB disk I call \"foo\", I have a shell script called mfoo. It doesn't matter how the \"foo\" disk gets recognized by the system, the shell script will make sure that the disk gets mounted at mnt/foo each time, and if the disk is encrypted, it will prompt me for the passphrase, if I don't use a key. The usr/dotfiles directory is kept in Git together with generic dotfiles that work identically across all systems, like .aliases. I use symlinks to the relevant files in the dotfiles directory. It looks something like this: $ ls -l ~/usr/dotfiles/config/i3 freebsd-config linux-config $ ls -l ~/.config/i3 config -> /home/foo/usr/dotfiles/config/i3/linux-config linux-config is then a specific configuration file for i3 which I only use on my Linux systems. This might be because the shortcut I use to run Firefox, starts Firefox in a AppArmor controlled Firejail, which doesn't exist on FreeBSD. On FreeBSD I might use Capsicum to get a similar experience. Just as an example. I have a couple of other subdirectories in the $HOME/usr directory besides the dotfiles directory, but those are not really relevant to mention in detail for this article (a directory for some outdated shell scripts, some wallpapers, etc.) NOTE: Configuration files (dotfiles) can be managed in many different ways. I have changed my approach a couple of times throughout the years. My preferred method is to keep my $HOME in Git. If you only run a single system or similar systems I can highly recommend the method I describe in the tutorial I have linked to. But remember this, don't just follow what other people tell you to do, find the way that makes you the most productive, the way that is best wired to \"fit your brain, your way of thinking\" and then simply change that if you later find a more productive way. The data and edata directories are the two main directories where I keep all my stuff. These two directories are ZFS datasets that run on a mirrored pool of disks that are separate from my root installation. I run both FreeBSD and several different Linux distributions on my main workstation and these each run on their own set of disks. All of this could be setup in other ways too, but I prefer this setup. I can easily mount both data and edata from both FreeBSD and Linux. The difference between data and edata is that edata is a ZFS native encrypted dataset. By utilizing ZFS I regularly use snapshots and ZFS send and receive for easy backup to network storage. This can be done even without decrypting the encrypted dataset. You could ask what the point is of having both an encryptet dataset and an unencryptet dataset, why not just put everything into the encryptet dataset? The fact is that I would rather not have anything encryptet at all. Encryption is great for privacy, but it is an absolute horrible layer of complexity to put on top of an already complex layer of a filesystem and ZFS encryption is not without its bugs, see issues 13533 and 14330. TIP: I highly recommend that you ALWAYS backup all your important data to multiple different storage solutions and locations - it's okay to be paranoid about important data. Actually, you SHOULD be paranoid about important data. I learned this the really hard way - a long time ago - when I had just finished writing a 200+ A4 pages book and then lost everything because of a silly mistake and had to start all over and write the book again! It is impossible to describe that very special feeling that arises when you have just realized what just happened! Noooooooooooooo! Pleeeeeeaseeeeee NOOOOOOOOOOO! (utter despair and disbelief - LOL). So, today I not only use ZFS send and receive, but I also copy data to other filesystems all together, using rsync. For encryption I utilize both ZFS native encryption, GELI (for my main FreeBSD root disks) and LUKS (for my main Linux root disks) and I also not only follow the 3-2-1 backup rule, but add further copies to multiple systems. That way, even if some bug is found that might cause a problem for me, I have a high degree of being able to get my files without having to mess with the problem. I do NOT use cloud storage for anything important. I rather keep local copies at places like family, friends or in a safety deposit box (unfortunately, safety deposit boxes are currently being removed from the banks in Denmark). In the data directory I have a few subdirectories: books notes source The books directory contains books I have written or I am working on. The source directory contains source code for various projects I work on. The notes directory contains a huge amount of personal notes on everything from health to politics to computer related subjects. I write everything in pure text, mainly in Markdown or just without any special markup. Everything is structured according to category or subject and it looks like this (short version): data/notes/ astronomy business electronics health it language ... Each main subject also has a subdirectory called files which I use for stuff I find online related to the subject. Files in the files directory can be images, text, audio and video. If I only have a few files, I just dump them all in the files directory, but if I have a lot, I organize them further by putting them in the relevant categories. Within each category of directory I might also keep a hidden subdirectory called .outdated. I use this hidden directory to put stuff away that is, well, outdated, but might still come in handy. It then looks something like this: $ tree . └── data └── notes └── it └── operating-systems ├── freebsd │ ├── .outdated │ ├── files │ │ ├── audio │ │ ├── images │ │ ├── text │ │ │ └── why-we-migrated-away-from-y-at-foo.pdf │ │ └── video │ │ └── how-we-setup-y-at-z.mp4 │ ├── how-to-do-x.md │ └── how-to-setup-y.md ├── linux └── openbsd I always keep an exported shell variable that contains the location of my notes. That way I can easily link to any other document or external file from within my notes and use Vim to open the file (if it's a text document) by pressing gf or use Vim's build in ability to execute a shell command from within the document. I use that to view PDF files or play a video, etc. In my notes I might have a Markdown link to a PDF file which looks like this: This is the [foo document]($NOTES/it/operating-systems/freebsd/files/text/foo.pdf) relevant for information about foo. When you have setup a default application for reading PDF files, then from within Vim you can just place the cursor on the filename and then press gx and Vim will open up the PDF file in the relevant PDF reader. Or you can copy and paste the path to the file and then open it with your PDF reader by typing ! from within Vim (I generally use MuPDF or zathura for reading PDF documents): :!mupdf $NOTES/it/operating-systems/freebsd/files/text/foo.pdf This works for other applications as well, such as opening video with mpv or images with something like feh. NOTE: Hyphen vs underscore in filenames and directory names? Originally, when I stopped using Windows back in about 1998, I was used to using spaces between words in filenames and directories. As I progressed into the world of Linux and BSD, I changed all spaces to underscores, but since I have done (and still do) a lot of web development I eventually settled on hyphens. I not only think it looks better, but the fact is that search engines interpret hyphens in file and directory names as spaces between words. Underscores are usually not recognized, and as such, their presence can negatively affect search engine optimization. Even though files in my home directory are my private files and not something I put out on the web, I have just settled on using hyphens everywhere. Filename \"foo_bar_baz\" becomes \"foobarbaz\" on a search engine, whereas \"foo-bar-baz\" becomes \"foo bar baz\". As mentioned, I also keep an encrypted directory called edata. I do that because I believe that it's important to encrypt private stuff in case your computer gets stolen. TIP: Remember that if you use encryption for anything which other family members might need to be able to access in case you pass away, you need to make sure that they know how to do that! The edata directory is organized in a similar fashion with \"categories\" being the main structure. documents \\letters \\foo \\bar \\receipts \\media \\family \\audio \\photos \\2022 \\2023 \\video \\2022 \\2023 \\foo \\photos \\2022 \\2023 \\video \\2023 \\projects \\foo \\documents \\email \\letters \\media \\photos \\2023 \\bar \\baz Subdirectories within documents and projects are further subdivided by categories depending on the relevant context. TIP: I have one basic rule which I implement regarding naming files and directories. The rule is this: I need to be able to easily determine what something is just by looking at the name. If you stumble upon a file that you don't know what is just by looking at the name of the file, open the file immediately and see what it is and then rename it to something that makes better sense the next time you happen to look at the filename. If you keep leaving files and directories in a mess, it quickly becomes very difficult to fix later. I personally use long and descriptive file names whenever it's needed to keep me from having to open the file in order to determine what the file is about. I have many times seen a mess like this in someones directory (I believe we have all been there at some point LOL): document.pdf document2.pdf document3.pdf Document.pdf document-new.pdf new-new-document.pdf new-new-new-document.pdf old-document.pdf ... If you're new to working with files and directories, you will most likely change your structure and setup more than once - don't worry about it, that's normal, it means you're evolving and improving your setup :) Last, but not least, I don't keep old data lying around forever. When I am sure something isn't useful any longer, I delete it.",

The files created by the installer, which are handled by the package manager. I can consult my package manager for files created by a specific package: pacman -Ql package_name. 2. The files created after installation (user preferences, plugins). The program should follow the XDG specification. reply sevagh 18 hours agorootparentI don't worry about where my distro package manager installs files.

(Although I admit some apps use the data directory which brings it up to 2) reply SAI_Peregrinus 19 hours agorootparentXDG isn't enforced, it's voluntary. So there will always be lots of applications not following it. reply wutwutwat 19 hours agorootparentprevI’m pretty sure that those package manager dirs you listed as being bad on Mac are in the same place on Linux (.yarn, .mix, etc). I believe they all honor some sort of ENV to set this for your system. XDG is not a thing on Windows either afaik. Is a convention on one operating system something other operating systems should be faulted for not following? Because if so, one could easily use the same argument to bash on Linux and Mac for not respecting “Program Files” folder, or Linux and Windows for not putting apps in the “/Applications” directory. If every operating system did things the same way, they’d be the same operating system. Differing conventions is exactly the point of having them in the first place, offering choice to the user. FWIW, I’ve personally seen XDG respected on macOS, because my .exports file defines `export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=\"${HOME}/.config\"` and my `~/.config` dir contains configurations for `neofetch`, `gh`, `yt-dlp`, and `btop`, all available via homebrew. The key thing imo is that the use or lack of use is up to the application developer, and not strictly enforced by the operating system, and looks to have absolutely nothing to do with the OS at all honestly. Do more Linux developers converge onto a shared common config directory? Maybe. But they don’t have to, as seen with your examples, so it not being “a thing over there” (which my example proves is false anyway) has nothing to do with “over there” at all, as it’s an app developer’s decision and case by case. reply kqr 18 hours agorootparent> XDG is not a thing on Windows either afaik.

GP is saying they should follow XDG on Linux not do it anywhere else! reply Macha 16 hours agorootparentThough if you're a CLI app on OS X, maybe consider it (especially if XDG_CONFIG_HOME _is_ defined), seems more common than the native OS X location for this type of app. reply s1gsegv 18 hours agorootparentprevI guess the ire towards macOS-created apps comes from the fact that you can write macOS things that work on Linux without doing the “proper” things for the platform. Windows is SO different that you have to do real porting work. When something requires a minimal amount of porting effort to do 100% perfectly, or zero effort to do 99% it seems a lot of apps go for that 99%. For my part writing cross platform apps I never actually realized there was a standard for arranging dotfiles so I wouldn’t have even realized I was leaving something out. XDG was one of those things I was vaguely aware existed and figured had something to do with the house of cards that is Linux desktop environments. reply cesarb 20 hours agoparentprevIMO, the GOPATH itself is a terrible design. It makes you mix together things from unrelated projects in the same directory structure, instead of each project having its own independent directory structure, like on every other programming language. The GOPATH design goes so much against the way I organize my projects, that it's the main reason I have never got interested into learning Go. Perhaps this design makes more sense for those who prefer to keep several unrelated projects together in a single monorepo, but that's not my preference. reply softirq 20 hours agorootparentGOPATH actually made me realize that the ~/src/$host/$owner/$repo organization structure makes a ton of sense for every project and as long as you organize all of your languages into this one tree, everything just works. reply sureglymop 20 hours agorootparentCan you expand on this a bit please? What does $host mean? Why would I need that for a purely local project that is only created for my own use? And what about grouping projects? E.g. \"personal\", \"work\", etc. And where in the structure are languages? Is that the overarching directory? reply bheadmaster 19 hours agorootparent> What does $host mean? In Go parlance, it would be the remote host where the repository is hosted, e.g. github.com, dev.azure.com, golang.org, etc. > Why would I need that for a purely local project that is only created for my own use? If nobody else is using your purely local project, and you're sure nobody will ever use it until the end of time, then I guess you could just use \"~/src/$HOSTNAME/$USERNAME/$PROJECTNAME\". Otherwise, it would be wise to setup a remote repository ahead of time. Go has a strong opinion that, in this day and age of distributed computing, projects should be online-first, so they can be easily used as dependencies. One of the nice consequences of this opinion is that Go dependencies can just be specified in the import statement - e.g. using grpc dependency is just: import \"google.golang.org/grpc\" No need for pom.xml, requirements.txt, cmake.txt, or any other kind of dependency configuration. It just works (unless it doesn't, like with private repositories, in which case it requires some exotic configurations in ~/.gitconfig or ~/.netrc, but that's a whole other can of worms - for most public repositories I've used it works flawlessly). > And what about grouping projects? E.g. \"personal\", \"work\", etc. Assuming you only use one repository hosting service and have one username, all your personal projects would be under \"~/src/$PERSONAL_HOSTING_SERVICE/$USERNAME/\", and your work would be under \"~/src/$WORK_HOSTING_SERVICE/$WORK_ENTITY/\" or something like this. > And where in the structure are languages? It isn't. That's either a bug or a feature. If it's a bug, you could just do the whole thing by language, e.g. \"~/src/go/\", \"~/src/java/\", etc. reply cesarb 19 hours agorootparent> No need for pom.xml, requirements.txt, cmake.txt, or any other kind of dependency configuration. It just works. ...until the project decides to switch to another hosting provider. Which has happened more than once in the past; it used to be common to host projects in Sourceforge, for a while Google Code was common, now many projects are on GitHub, and it won't surprise me at all when another forge becomes the popular one. Individually, projects might switch between being self-hosted (in their own domain name) and hosted on a shared forge (using the forge's domain name). IMO, it's a bad design. It forces the project's repository's location to become the project's official \"name\", that is, it mixes up location and naming. It's better to have an indirection layer to map the project name to the project location, like most other languages do. reply Macha 16 hours agorootparent> ...until the project decides to switch to another hosting provider Or decides their github username looks better with an upper case letter (https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/issues/570).

In my case it's mostly true but it's still icky and ugly to see a crowded home dir. reply bshacklett 18 hours agorootparentprevI can’t tell if this is sarcasm or not. $HOME is the one directory which belongs to the user. In some cases, it might even be encrypted with a user-owned key. I can’t imagine being comfortable putting my files anywhere _outside_ of the home directory. That feels like going back to the DOS / Win3.x days where hard drives were the wild west. reply mturmon 18 hours agorootparentI follow the above advice. My personal stuff is in $HOME/$MY_FIRSTNAME. I can organize this directory any way I want to, e.g. by project, time, purpose, whatever. It’s my stuff. The stuff in $HOME is then more “the computer’s stuff.” (E.g., on MacOS, Photos, Desktop, Downloads - that’s where the computer dumps that stuff.) The other place is where I put things. This turns out to work quite well. It allows me to be unconcerned when some application wants to put something in $HOME. reply eternauta3k 15 hours agorootparentExactly, or simply \"$HOME/a\" for less typing. reply Linux-Fan 18 hours agorootparentprevTo me its a sane choice on my own single-user machine. I used to create a top level `/data` directory to put my stuff into (before Android was widespread :) ). Nowdays, my data resides in `/data/main`. This scheme has served me well for more than 10a and through various OS migrations (Windows -> Ubuntu -> Debian). I don't want to have all this `.cache` and similar stuff to take up my expensive backup storage, nor do I want to waste time cleaning up after all the applications that create/expect files in `$HOME` or think this a sensible place to put executable files. I don't want arbitrary applications (heard of tracker?) to start indexing my files and waste CPU on that etc. Also I don't believe in /home being portable across multiple Linux distributions because e.g. different application versions might require config files to be migrated. Hence I opt for `/data` that can safely be shared across multiple systems because it contains actual data and not some OS-related state files. On multi-user systems, the `/data` approach doesn't scale. There, I prefer to do just as boomboomsubban writes: I create a subdirectory in $HOME (usually, I call it `wd`, the \"working directory\") and treat that like my local `/data/main`. For large/temporary files (e.g. application downloads etc.) I add a `$HOME/large` directory to keep the `wd` reasonably small in such cases such that I can again include it in backups without having to worry about the size. YMMV reply bmacho 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's not sarcasm. It's a pro tip which makes your life easier. Also $HOME is a system directory, and it belongs to your operating system (.bashrc and such), also to your DE, also about every program and standard that I am aware of claims it for itself to use (freedesktop and such). reply chasil 18 hours agorootparentprevMy ORACLE_HOME is in /home/oracle.

Or absolutely moronic things like ~/.config/VSCod*/*Cache* -- really, cache in config? reply jmbwell 20 hours agoparentprevI wish more developers would seek out and embrace libraries for saving things in sensible locations. Python has one called “platformdirs” that takes the guesswork out of where to save things automatically for the user’s platform. I have no doubt all the other major environments have something similar.

My home directory is nearly empty, because all the files I work with are in OwnCloud (so the real question is: what is the directory structure in OwnCloud). Local Git repositories are on a completely separate partition. Since KeepassXC now handles SSH keys, the keys from .ssh are now in the Keepass-file, which is on OwnCloud. That was a huge simplification, and now there is nothing in my home directory that I really care much about. reply mingus88 20 hours agoparentThe only thing that matters to me is portability when I switch systems, and aware of work vs personal environments I need to be able to login and run a single command to sync to have the appropriate set of files for whatever /linux/work/personal/desktop/server I am on For example, I never want certain environment variables to be exported to work systems, like my home vault endpoint or certain tokens. I recently switched to home-manager from the NixOS project and it looks very promising. The Nix language is complicated but the abstraction to define all these different types of environments is exactly what I need, and git branches manage the work/personal split of file content reply kevindamm 21 hours agoparentprevI still put my .vimrc and .bashrc/.zshrc there. reply kebman 20 hours agoprevI think it's a nice idea, but don't like the media structure into family and so on. Looks like he's going to have a ton of problems with duplicates and then edited duplicates down the line, which can easily be mixed up, and then you lose your edits and so on. Pictures are better sorted with EXIF keywords. So, metadata stored in the picture itself, perhaps even in the MIME type. Thus, if a picture is family related, just tag it #family, or #personx and so on. This is why I store them in the same folder on a per-date basis. The rest is keywords edited with programs such as Adobe Bridge and so on. As for document file name structure, text files and the like, I've used both `Date then Descrpition.txt` or `Keyword Title or Description and then Date.txt` with the date obviously being an ISO date such that `YYYY-MM-DD-hhmm` with `-hhmm` being optional, also for sorting reasons. Sometimes I like sorting on \"topics\" i.e. keywords or titles, but other times, such as in logs, I like the date first because it's more essential to know when you logged something, and not necessarily the topic. You should think the date is superfluous since it's also stored in the system. However, my experience that when you move around a file, the date eventually changes, and certainly if you make a mistake along the way. Meanwhile a filename date doesn't change. Also it helps with list sorting where applicable. reply philsnow 16 hours agoparentMedia-specific content-addressed stores (ideally as overlays which refer to but don't change your directory structure or file organization) seem to be the way to go with this. I think photoprism and photostructure don't really care about your directory structure or organization, but paperless(-ngx, or whatever is the most current iteration) is \"notorious\" for being opinionated about organization / not wanting to respect your organization. I used camlistore/perkeep for photos for a while, but google photos has an absolutely killer feature of knowing who is in every picture, even accounting for age: although two of my boys who are 8 years apart look really similar at similar ages, it knows who is who. I don't know if it uses facial analysis or photo metadata or what, but it has never mistaken one for the other. I don't have a reasonable way of getting that tag information out of google photos (even though I'm paying for the service). It might be time to revisit this, though.. I don't recall whether photostructure / photoprism try to do facial recognition, but even if they don't already, I bet they'll soon be roughly on par with google photos (or good enough that I can stop depending on google for this). That's documents and photos / videos, what about music? For better or for worse, It's been at least a ~decade since I tried keeping my own music collection as files. Are there things these days like paperless / photoprism, a library system for music that has deeper integration with the content than just \"files on disk\"? reply kebman 12 hours agorootparentDepends a bit on the use case. For personal photos, mobile photos and the like, I use Google Photo as well. But it just isn't suitable for professional storage or sorting IMHO, tho the face recognition is certainly neat. The best I've came across was FotoStation, but it's many years since I worked with those sorta things. reply vbezhenar 19 hours agoprevFor me the way I use is as follows: Capital names for GUI things, lowercase names for CLI things. I'd prefer ~/documents, etc, but GUI people insist on capitalizing, so whatever. Very rarely I have to mix those, so it's not a big problem. ~/dotfiles is my dotfiles directory with git. I create ~/.zshrc -> dotfiles/zshrc, etc. I don't use any software to manage that, I just create symlinks. In the past I've used ~/.dotfiles but I think that making it visible makes more sense. ~/projects is my projects directory. ~/projects/test is throwaway test projects to check things out, etc. ~/projects/my is my personal projects. ~/projects/company is projects for company I'm working for. I'm kind of freelancer and sometimes work for different companies, so separation is necessary. ~/tmp is my throwaway directory for everything. I have shell function mkcdtmp which creates ~/tmp/240419 (current date) and cds into it. It's a wonderful way. I rarely clean it, because I prefer to buy big discs and keep trash around, somewhat organized. If I need something from yesterday or past month, I know where to find it. That's the most important thing I did for organizing my temp work which is plenty. Of course I can create ~/tmp/whatever if needed, it's all trash stuff. Well, that's all, I guess. I don't use ~/Desktop. I rarely use ~/Documents, still need to find a way to organize it. Also I dump my short notes and stuff to my github repo which builds a personal website. I tried various notes software but ordinary website with markdown turned out the best way for me. I never was able to organize my work in a very structured way, it's always piles of trash moving around which eventually turn into something usable, so instead of fighting myself I decided to make that trash organized. Essentially my computer is disposable. Everything in ~/projects is in git. Everything in ~/tmp is not very important and more like a cache or discarded work. I'm trying to organize things in a way so restoring it from the clean state wouldn't take much time.

And each project has a month + day prefix. Sometimes I want long term projects to pop up on top, so I prefix them with 0000 (or only make the day 00). It is simple, works on any OS. Although on Linux I do have some helper scripts. And it is very easy to quickly make a directory and move files from downloads into this directory. Keeping the nesting only one level deep helps for the discoverability. (versus the YYYY/MM/DD pattern which uses an extra month level) reply julianeon 13 hours agoparentI do something similar for relevant folders, where I organize by time. I have a top level dir where I usually have what I'm working on at the moment - think \"this day\" or \"this week\". When it's time to archive it, outside that time window, I created a folder, using this format, for example for today: 041924 I move all the files I created on that day into there. As a person with a typical human lifespan, I see no need to use a \"2024\" string - I don't think I'll live to see 2100, and anything before 2000 isn't relevant. \"24\" is just fine. And that's it. Time keeps rolling on, so the number of 'archive' folders keeps increasing, but they're small in size and easy to locate. This works really well when you're creating not-that-unique standard files every day, btw, which is my use case. reply quesera 11 hours agorootparent> 041924 I can accept YY instead of YYYY, but surely YYMMDD is preferable due to sort order. reply julianeon 11 hours agorootparentThe advantage of 041924 is that, when changing directories from the terminal, you can type 0419 and tab the rest of the way (99% of the time the only completion is 24).

There's no portable filesystem metadata, and while a few kinds of media files have facilities for internal metadata (e.g. EXIF and ID3), most don't. A file name is the only non-content that is easy to keep associated with any kind of file. The syntax is definitely an imperfect compromise, but most of the things I use this for have titles that frequently contain spaces (books, papers, music, etc.) so quoting would be necessary anyway, and I made myself a Python package to help with escaping and do other utility tasks like normalizing ISBNs. reply Karellen 20 hours agorootparentprevA lot of filesystems don't store file creation dates.

As I progressed into the world of Linux and BSD, I changed all spaces to underscores, but since I have done (and still do) a lot of web development I eventually settled on hyphens. I not only think it looks better, but the fact is that search engines interpret hyphens in file and directory names as spaces between words. Underscores are usually not recognized, and as such, their presence can negatively affect search engine optimization. Even though files in my home directory are my private files and not something I put out on the web, I have just settled on using hyphens everywhere. I couldn't agree more. It's so practice to use hyphens when navigating on terminal that i think it should be a standard. It's even better than pressingevery time to select an underscored filename orfor spaces.

I don't want to deal with symlink management and such, and it's an easy way to say \"These five manually selected dotfiles get saved\". I have a separate Vorta profile just for them. I have projects folders for each category of project, and each project gets a folder. Anything programming related, gets a git repo. I used to have my top level folders by category, documents, code, etc, and that was a miserable idea. I much prefer sorting by project. Any folder can have an \"Archive\" dir for old stuff. I also have a Collected folder, for stuff that's I just found online and saved, sorted by category. Stuff like RasPi os images and sound fonts go there. It's like downloads but less ephemeral. Then I have the one that people might not like... TheRuins. Whenever I do a clean reinstall of an OS, which used to be every few years, my old home dir would go there. I don't want to just use a new home dir, because for one thing it's probably 95% stuff I don't actually need, and also it might have files for some old version of some app that might break the new one. Stuff I actually DO want, I can manually move along into my new home dir out of the old Ruins. The rest can just stay until I eventually need more space and move it into an SSD. All of my media files live in a folder synced with SyncThing, as do a lot of other things. Stuff I really want to keep gets replicated to my phone and tablet, as well as actually being backed up. Finally everything gets backed up with Vorta. It's deduplication is amazing when you often move stuff around in a Ruins folder.

For more... interesting network scenarios, it can be helpful to construct some variable, say, $HOSTABI, that includes tokens for both hardware and OS. $ echo $HOSTABI x86_64-ubu-2204 Which can then be used inside architecture-influenced variables like ARCH, LIBRARY_PATH / LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, as well as inside the user's own installation system (makefiles, etc) used for anything the user compiled. Great for just installing some new hw/sw combo, mount home, cd into \"~/src\" or equivalent and run \"make install\", and just get all your own code recompiled and installed for your new architecture. This is a microcosm of what sysadmins on heterogeneous networks do, mostly for different hardware architectures, although this was a much more common situation in earlier years than more recently where Linux has taken over even more of the corporate/research world. I've found it pretty useful even at home, where I'm using my one home directory across my systems' different installations of Linux with different library requirements (although I should probably sell that SGI Onyx/RE - IRIX not Linux - that Wing Commander III was rendered on).

For other \"tier 2\" things I either know where they are due to long habit (most stuff doesn't move or it's obvious which folder e.g. a PDF will be in) or I use a combination of `M-x locate` and `M-x grep` which works pretty well. Re: concerns about \"where apps store stuff\" I mostly don't care because everything I care about is in Dropbox. If it's something I use a lot, its config is symlinked in wherever the app expects it to be - otherwise everything is a few `dired` commands away. (On macOS `M-x locate` can be configured to use the builtin `mdfind` which works very well for finding things IME. I think it's what drives Spotlight.) At some point I may set up 'recoll' and all that but so far I haven't needed it so I haven't paid the complexity tax of trying to configure that across Windows/macOS/Linux vs. good old locate/grep FWIW because I limit myself to a \"standard\" set of apps (Emacs, browser, VLC, PDF/image viewer) the above setup works pretty much the same across Windows/macOS/Linux, so most of the time I don't have to care that much which system I'm typing into reply weinzierl 20 hours agoprevI wish every OS had a space that is only and truly my space.

[0] https://github.com/andsens/homeshick reply subuwm 18 hours agoprevIt seems to me that directories are a fundamentally flawed system or organizing files. A natural way to start a directory structure is by basing it on the type of file (i e. games, music, pictures etc) but that will quickly fall apart after you want your files of different \"types\" relating to X to be under the same directory. So now you can either create some symlink mess, include the wrong \"type\" of file in your directory tree, or restructure. The problem with restructuring is that it's a lot of work and the end result is not really worth it. What tends to happen (at least for me) is overly deep directory structures (and/or too much branching) that are tedious to navigate, and in the end have the same problem. Another option is to just bite the bullet and create a X subdir for each of your main directories that have relevant files for X which is what I do. But that really sucks and I wish there was a better alternative that actually worked with existing programs which assume a directory based organization. There are some alternatives that work on top of existing filesystems e.g. tag based systems but I haven't tried them yet and I suspect they have their own headaches. reply carlinm 15 hours agoprevI've got my own little structure: # projects I work on code/ dotfiles/ # main obsidian.md repo that everything I learn dumps into omega/ # public repos for local code spelunking, these remain untouched repos/ It's just organically evolved, borrowing from this and that. reply otterpro 19 hours agoprevI also have similar data structure for dotfiles...

A small bonus the two-level cache-like global attachment dir is essentially a nicely balanced tree, meaning if I decide (experimented than dropped since of no use for me) to index my files for instance with Recoll (Xapian comfy wrapper) the indexing is typically faster than in a classic curated taxonomy. reply shmerl 16 hours agoprevLooks like there is some progress with $HOME/.mozilla to be more XDG base directory compliant. reply calvinmorrison 21 hours agoprevcalvin@bison:~/work$ tree -dhead . ├── 2022 │ ├── 04 │ │ ├── 19 https://git.ceux.org/today.git/about/ so i open my shell, it drops me into ~/t/, which is symlinked to ~/work/YYYY/DD/MM. my GTK file picker is also setup to automatically give me the last 3 days on the bookmark bar.

    "originBody": "The Digital Antiquarian April 19, 2024 • 26 comments The Curse of Monkey Island Share Tweet Pin Mail SMS Fair Warning: this article contains plot spoilers for Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge and The Curse of Monkey Island. No puzzle spoilers, however… The ending of 1991’s Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge is as shocking in its way as that of the infamous last episode of the classic television series St. Elsewhere. Just as the lovable wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood is about to finally dispatch his arch-nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck, the latter tears off his mask to reveal that he is in reality Guybrush’s older brother, looking rather irritated but hardly evil or undead. Guybrush, it seems, is just an ordinary suburban kid who has wandered away from his family to play make-believe inside a storage room at Big Whoop Amusement Park, LeChuck the family member who has been dispatched to find him. An irate janitor appears on the scene: “Hey, kids! You’re not supposed to be in here!” And so the brothers make their way out to rejoin their worried parents, and another set of Middle American lives goes on. The ending served partially as Ron Gilbert’s homage to one of his games’ inspirations, the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland. In more practical terms, however, it steered the burgeoning Monkey Island franchise straight into a cul de sac with no obvious escape. Gilbert soon left LucasArts to found Humongous Entertainment, where he would use the SCUMM graphic-adventure engine he had helped to invent to make educational games for youngsters, even as LucasArts would continue to evolve the same technology to make more adventure games of their own. It’s hard not to imagine Gilbert cackling over his shoulder like LeChuck himself as he walks out the door, confident that he has sequel-proofed Monkey Island for all time: “Let’s see you write your way out of that ending!” For a surprisingly long time, LucasArts really did seem nonplussed by the trap Gilbert had sprung on them. A third Monkey Island game was nowhere to be seen, not even after the first two became icons of their genre. Still, it is a law of the games industry that sequels to hit games will out, sooner or later and one way or another. In late 1995, LucasArts’s management decided to make a third Monkey Island at last, trick ending be damned. Why they chose to do so at this particular juncture isn’t entirely clear. Perhaps they could already sense an incipient softening of the adventure market — a downturn that would become all too obvious over the next eighteen months or so — and wanted the security of such an established name as this one if they were to invest big bucks in another adventure project. Or perhaps they just thought they had waited long enough. Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley. Whatever their reasoning in beginning the project, they chose for the gnarly task of finding a way out of the trap laid by Ron Gilbert an in-house artist and a programmer, a pair of good friends who had been employed at LucasArts for years and were itching to move into a design role. Larry Ahern had been hired to help draw Monkey Island 2 and had gone on to work on most of LucasArts’s adventure games since, while Jonathan Ackley had programmed large parts of Day of the Tentacle and The Dig. Knowing of their design aspirations, management came to them one day to ask if they’d like to become co-leads on a prospective Monkey Island 3. It was an extraordinary amount of faith to place in such unproven hands, but it would not prove to have been misplaced. “We were too green to suggest anything else [than Monkey Island 3], especially an original concept,” admits Ahern, “and were too dumb to worry about all the responsibility of updating a classic game series.” He and Ackley brainstormed together in a room for two months, hashing out the shape of a game. After they emerged early in 1996 with their design bible for The Curse of Monkey Island in hand, production got underway in earnest. Ahern and Ackley escaped from Ron Gilbert’s trap about as nimbly as anyone could have — which is to say, not very nimbly at all. At the end of Monkey Island 2, they announced, Guybrush had actually been “hexed” by LeChuck into believing he was just a little boy in an amusement park.[1]An Easter egg at the very end of Monkey Island 2 did actually foreshadow this ending. In the words of commenter Guillermo Crespi: “If you wait long enough once the credits roll over the Amusement Park background, you’re shown a small scene with Elaine, and she says, ‘I wonder what’s keeping Guybrush? I hope LeChuck hasn’t cast some horrible SPELL over him or anything.'” This may very well have been added by someone at LucasArts as a last-minute escape hatch, possibly without Ron Gilbert’s knowledge. By the beginning of the third game, he would have snapped back to his senses, abandoning mundane hallucination again for a fantastical piratey reality. A team that peaked at 50 people labored over The Curse of Monkey Island for eighteen months. That period was one of dramatic change in the industry, when phrases like “multimedia” and “interactive movie” were consigned to the kitschy past and first-person shooters and real-time strategies came to dominate the sales charts. Having committed to the project, LucasArts felt they had no choice but to stick with the old-school pixel art that had always marked their adventure games, even though it too was fast becoming passé in this newly 3D world. By way of compensation, this latest LucasArts pixel art was to be more luscious than anything that had come out of the studio before, taking advantage of a revamped SCUMM engine that ran at a resolution of 640 X 480 instead of 320 X 200. The end result is, in the opinion of this critic at least, the loveliest single game in terms of pure visuals that LucasArts ever produced. Computer graphics and animation, at LucasArts and elsewhere, had advanced enormously between Monkey Island 2 and The Curse of Monkey Island. With 1993’s Day of the Tentacle and Sam and Max Hit the Road, LucasArts’s animators had begun producing work that could withstand comparison to that of role models like Chuck Jones and Don Bluth without being laughed out of the room. (Indeed, Jones reportedly tried to hire Larry Ahern and some of his colleagues away from LucasArts after seeing Day of the Tentacle.) The Curse of Monkey Island marked the fruition of that process, showing LucasArts to have become a world-class animation studio in its own right, one that could not just withstand but welcome comparison with any and all peers who worked with more traditional, linear forms of media. “We were looking at Disney feature animation as our quality bar,” says Ahern. That said, the challenge of producing a game that still looked like Monkey Island despite all the new technical affordances should not be underestimated. The danger of the increased resolution was always that the finished results could veer into a sort of photo-realism, losing the ramshackle charm that had always been such a big part of Monkey Island‘s appeal. This LucasArts managed to avoid; in the words of The Animation World Network, a trade organization that was impressed enough by the project to come out and do a feature on it, Guybrush was drawn as “a pencil-necked beanpole with a flounce of eighteenth-century hair and a nose as vertical as the face of Half Dome.” The gangling frames and exaggerated movements of Guybrush and many of the other characters were inspired by Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas. Yet the characters aren’t grotesques; The Curse of Monkey Island aims to be lovable, and it hits the mark. For this game is written as well as drawn in the spirit of the original Secret of Monkey Island, abandoning the jarring mean-spiritedness that dogs the second game in the series even long before you get to that ending, a change in tone that has always left me a lot less positively disposed toward it than most people seem to be. The three principal characters here are once again Guybrush, LeChuck, and their mutual love interest, the spirited and fetching Elaine. This was the first Monkey Island game to feature voice acting from the outset, as telling a testament as any to the technological gulf that lies between the second and third entries in the series. The performances are superb — especially Guybrush, who sounds exactly like I want him to, all gawky innocence and dogged determination. (His voice actor Dominic Armato would return for every single Monkey Island game that followed, as well as circling back to give Guybrush a voice in the remastered versions of the first two games. I, for one, wouldn’t have it any other way.) The opening sees Guybrush adrift on the open ocean in, of all forms of conveyance, a floating bumper car, for reasons that aren’t initially clear beyond the thematic connection to that amusement park at the end of Monkey Island 2. He floats smack-dab into the middle of a sea battle between LeChuck and Elaine; the former is trying to abduct the latter to make her his bride, while the latter is doing her level best to maintain her single status. Stuff happens, LeChuck seems to get blown up, and Guybrush and Elaine wind up on Plunder Island, a retirement community for aging pirates that’s incidentally also inhabited by El Pollo Diablo, the giant demon chicken. (“He’s hatching a diabolical scheme”; “He’s establishing a new pecking order”; “He’s going to buck buck buck the system”; “He’s crossing the road to freedom”; etc.) Guybrush proposes to Elaine using a diamond ring he stole from the hold of LeChuck’s ship, only to find that there’s a voodoo curse laid on it. Elaine gets turned into a solid-gold statue (d’oh!), which Guybrush leaves standing on the beach while he tries to figure out what to do about the situation. Sure enough, some opportunistic pirates — is there any other kind? — sail away with it. (Double d’oh!) Guybrush is left to scour Plunder Island for a ship, a crew, and a map that will let him follow them to Blood Island, where there is conveniently supposed to be another diamond ring that can reverse the curse. The vicious chickens of Plunder Island. “Larry and I thought we were so clever when we came up with the idea of having a tropical island covered with feral chickens,” says Jonathan Ackley. “Then I took a vacation to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It seems that when Kauai was hit by Hurricane Iniki, it blew open all the chicken coops. Everywhere I went on the island I was surrounded by feral chickens.” From the shopping list of quest items to the plinking steelband soundtrack that undergirds the proceedings, all of this is a dead ringer for The Secret of Monkey Island; this third game is certainly not interested in breaking any new ground in setting, story, or genre. But when it’s done this well, who cares? There is a vocal segment of Monkey Island fans who reject this game on principle, who say that any Monkey Island game without the name of Ron Gilbert first on its credits list is no Monkey Island game at all. For my own part, I tend to believe that, if we didn’t know that Gilbert didn’t work on this game, we’d have trouble detecting that fact from the finished product. It nails that mixture of whimsy, cleverness, and sweetness that has made The Secret of Monkey Island arguably the most beloved point-and-click adventure game of all time. During the latter 1990s, when most computers games were still made by and for a fairly homogeneous cohort of young men, too much ludic humor tried to get by on transgression rather than wit; this was a time of in-groups punching — usually punching down — on out-groups. I’m happy to say that The Curse of Monkey Island‘s humor is nothing like that. At the very beginning, when Guybrush is floating in that bumper car, he scribbles in his journal about all the things he wishes he had. “If only I could have a small drink of freshwater, I might have the strength to sail on.” A bottle of water drifts past while Guybrush’s eyes are riveted to the page. “If I could reach land, I might find water and some food. Fruit maybe, something to fight off the scurvy and help me get my strength back. Maybe some bananas.” And a crate of bananas drifts by in the foreground. “Oh, why do I torture myself like this? I might as well wish for some chicken and a big mug of grog, for all the good it will do me.” Cue the clucking chicken perched on top of a barrel. Now, you might say that this isn’t exactly sophisticated humor, and you’d be right. But it’s an inclusive sort of joke that absolutely everyone is guaranteed to understand, from children to the elderly, whilst also being a gag that I defy anyone not to at least smirk at. Monkey Island is funny without ever being the slightest bit cruel — a combination that’s rarer in games of its era than it ought to be. Which isn’t to say that this game is without in-jokes. They’re everywhere, and the things they reference are far from unexpected. Star Trek gets a shout-out in literally the first line of the script as Guybrush writes in his “captain’s log,” while, appropriately enough given the studio that made this game, whole chunks of dialogue are re-contextualized extracts from the Star Wars movies. The middle of the game is an extended riff on/parody of that other, very different franchise that springs to mind when gamers think about pirates — the one started by Sid Meier, that’s known as simply Pirates!. Here as there, you have to sail your ship around the Caribbean engaging in battles with other sea dogs. But instead of dueling the opposing captains with your trusty cutlass when you board their vessels, here you challenge them to a round of insult sword-fighting instead. (Pirate: “You’re the ugliest monster ever created!” Guybrush: “If you don’t count all the ones you’ve dated!”) One of the game’s best gags is an interactive musical number you perform with your piratey crew, feeding them appropriate rhymes. “As far as I know, nobody had ever done interactive singing before,” says Jonathan Ackley. “I think it was an original idea and I still laugh when I see it.” Sadly, the song was cut from the game’s foreign localizations as a bridge too far from its native English, even for LucasArts’s superb translators. It shouldn’t work, but somehow it does. In fact, this may just be my favorite section of the entire game. Partly it succeeds because it’s just so well done; the action-based minigame of ship-to-ship combat that precedes each round of insult sword-fighting is, in marked contrast to those in LucasArts’s previous adventure Full Throttle, very playable in its own right, being perfectly pitched in difficulty, fun without ever becoming frustrating. But another key to this section’s success is that you don’t have to know Pirates! for it to make you laugh; it’s just that, if you do, you’ll laugh that little bit more. All of the in-jokes operate the same way. Pirates! veterans will feel right at home with the ship-combat minigame. It was originally more complicated. “When I first started the ship-combat section,” says programmer Chris Purvis, “I had a little readout that told how many cannons you had, when they were ready to fire, and a damage printout for when you or the computer ships got hit. We decided it was too un-adventure-gamey to leave it that way.” Not to be outdone, a member of the testing team proposed implementing multiplayer ship combat as “the greatest Easter egg of all time for any game.” Needless to say, it didn’t happen. The puzzle design makes for an interesting study. After 1993, the year of Day of the Tentacle and Sam and Max Hit the Road, LucasArts hit a bumpy patch in this department in my opinion. Both Full Throttle and The Dig, their only adventures between those games and this one, are badly flawed efforts when it comes to their puzzles, adhering to the letter but not the spirit of Ron Gilbert’s old “Why Adventure Games Suck” manifesto. And Grim Fandango, the adventure that immediately followed this one, fares if anything even worse in that regard. I’m pleased if somewhat perplexed to be able to say, then, that The Curse of Monkey Island mostly gets its puzzles right. There are two difficulty levels here, an innovation borrowed from Monkey Island 2. Although the puzzles at the “Mega-Monkey” level are pretty darn convoluted — one sequence involving a restaurant and a pirate’s tooth springs especially to mind as having one more layer of complexity that it really needs to — they are never completely beyond the pale. It might not be a totally crazy idea to play The Curse of Monkey Island twice, once at the easy level and once at the Mega-Monkey level, with a few weeks or months in between your playthroughs. There are very few adventure games for which I would make such a recommendation in our current era of entertainment saturation, but I think it’s a reasonable one in this case. This game is stuffed so full of jokes both overt and subtle that it can be hard to take the whole thing in in just one pass. Your first excursion will give you the lay of the land, so to speak, so you know roughly what you’re trying to accomplish when you tackle the more complicated version. Regardless of how you approach it, The Curse of Monkey Island is a big, generous adventure game by any standard. I daresay that the part that takes place on Plunder Island alone is just about as long as the entirety of The Secret of Monkey Island. After that comes the Pirates! homage, to serve as a nice change of pace at the perfect time. And then there’s another whole island of almost equal size to the first to explore. After all that comes the bravura climax, where LeChuck makes his inevitable return; in a rather cheeky move, this ending too takes place in an amusement park, with Guybrush once again transformed into a child. Whatever else you can say about their way of escaping Ron Gilbert’s trap, you can’t accuse Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley of simply hand-waving it away. If I was determined to find something to complain about, I might say that the back half of The Curse of the Monkey Island isn’t quite as strong as the front half. Blood Island is implemented a little more sparsely than Plunder Island, and the big climax in particular feels a little rushed and truncated, doubtless the result of a production budget and schedule that just couldn’t be stretched any further if the game was to ship in time for the 1997 Christmas season. Still, these are venial sins; commercial game development is always the art of the possible, usually at the expense of the ideal. When all is said and done, The Curse of Monkey Island might just be my favorite LucasArts adventure, although it faces some stiff competition from The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle. Any points that it loses to Secret for its lack of originality in the broad strokes, it makes up for in size, in variety, and in sheer gorgeousness. Although I have no firm sales figures to point to, all indications are that The Curse of Monkey Island was a commercial success in its day, the last LucasArts adventure about which that statement can be made. I would guess from anecdotal evidence that it sold several hundred thousand copies, enough to convince the company to go back to the Monkey Island well one more time in 2000. Alas, the fourth game would be far less successful, both artistically and commercially. These things alone are enough to give Curse a valedictory quality today. But there’s more: it was also the very last LucasArts game to use the SCUMM engine, as well as the last to rely primarily on pixel art. The world-class cartoon-animation studio that the company’s adventure division had become was wound down after this game’s release, and Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley were never given a chance to lead a project such as this one again, despite having acquitted themselves so well here. That was regrettable, but not incomprehensible. Economics weren’t working in the adventure genre’s favor in the late 1990s. A game like The Curse of Monkey Island was more expensive to make per hour of play time it provided than any other kind of game you could imagine; all of this game’s content was bespoke content, every interaction a unique one that had to be written and story-boarded and drawn and painted and animated and voiced from scratch. The only way that adventure games — at least adventures with AAA production values like this one — could have remained an appealing option for gaming executives would have been if they had sold in truly massive numbers. And this they emphatically were not doing. Yes, The Curse of Monkey Island did reasonably well for itself — but a game like Jedi Knight probably did close to an order of magnitude better, whilst probably costing considerably less to make. The business logic wasn’t overly complicated. The big animation studios which LucasArts liked to see as their peers could get away with it because their potential market was everyone with a television or everyone who could afford to buy a $5 movie ticket; LucasArts, on the other hand, was limited to those people who owned fairly capable, modern home computers, who liked to solve crazily convoluted puzzles, and who were willing and able to drop $40 or $50 for ten hours or so of entertainment. The numbers just didn’t add up. In a sense, then, the surprise isn’t that LucasArts made no more games like this one, but rather that they allowed this game to be finished at all. Jonathan Ackley recalls his reaction when he saw Half-Life for the first time: “Well… that’s kind of it for adventure games as a mainstream, AAA genre.” More to their credit than otherwise, the executives at LucasArts didn’t summarily abandon the adventure genre, but rather tried their darnedest to find a way to make the economics work, by embracing 3D modelling to reduce production costs and deploying a new interface that would be a more natural fit with the tens of millions of game consoles that were out there, thus broadening their potential customer base enormously. We’ll get to the noble if flawed efforts that resulted from these initiatives in due course. For today, though, we raise our glasses to The Curse of Monkey Island, the last and perhaps the best go-round for SCUMM. If you haven’t played it yet, by all means, give it a shot. And even if you have, remember what I told you earlier: this is a game that can easily bear replaying. Its wit, sweetness, and beauty remain undiminished more than a quarter of a century after its conception. The Curse of Monkey Island: The Graphic Novel (I’ve cheerfully stolen this progression from the old Prima strategy guide to the game…) Our story begins with our hero, Guybrush Threepwood, lost at sea and pining for his love Elaine. He soon discovers her in the midst of a pitched battle… …with his old enemy and rival for her fair hand, the zombie pirate LeChuck. Guybrush is captured by LeChuck… …but manages to escape, sending LeChuck’s ship to the bottom in the process. Thinking LeChuck finally disposed of, Guybrush proposes to Elaine, using a diamond ring he found in the zombie pirate’s treasure hold… …only to discover it is cursed. Elaine is less than pleased… …and is even more ticked off when she is turned into a gold statue. Guybrush sets off to discover a way to break the curse — and to rescue Elaine, since her statue is promptly stolen. His old friend the voodoo lady tells him he will need a ship, a crew, and a map to Blood Island, where he can find a second diamond ring that will reverse the evil magic of the first. He meets many interesting and irritating people, including some barbers… …a restaurateur… …and a cabana boy, before he is finally able to set sail for Blood Island. After some harrowing sea battles and a fierce storm… …his ship is washed ashore on Blood Island. Meanwhile LeChuck has been revived… …and has commanded his minions to scour the Caribbean in search of Guybrush. Unaware of this, Guybrush explores Blood Island, where he meets a patrician bartender… …the ghost of a Southern belle… …a vegan cannibal… …and a Welsh ferryman. He finally outsmarts Andre, King of the Smugglers, to get the diamond that will restore Elaine. Unfortunately, as soon as Elaine is uncursed, the two are captured by LeChuck and taken to the Carnival of the Damned on Monkey Island. LeChuck turns Guybrush into a little boy and attempts to escape with Elaine on his hellish roller coaster. But Guybrush’s quick thinking saves the day, and he sails off with his new bride into the sunset. Did you enjoy this article? If so, please think about pitching in to help me make many more like it.

In the words of commenter Guillermo Crespi: “If you wait long enough once the credits roll over the Amusement Park background, you’re shown a small scene with Elaine, and she says, ‘I wonder what’s keeping Guybrush? I hope LeChuck hasn’t cast some horrible SPELL over him or anything.'” This may very well have been added by someone at LucasArts as a last-minute escape hatch, possibly without Ron Gilbert’s knowledge. previous post This Week on The Analog Antiquarian 26 responses Keith April 19, 2024 I loved this game so much when it came out. A long-awaited sequel that didn’t disappoint, and this article was a wonderful reminder. Thanks! > Still, it is a law of the games industry that sequels to hit games will out Not sure that’s the intended wording. > Dan Bluth Don > Grim Fandango, the adventure that immediately followed this one, fairs if anything even worse fares Reply Jimmy Maher April 19, 2024 Thanks! (The first was as intended…) Reply Derek April 19, 2024 First off: The Curse of Monkey Island has the best soundtrack of any adventure game and I will die on this hill. The end of the game was definitely truncated. There was a whole cutscene at the juncture between Part V and VI that was storyboarded but not animated (explaining how Guybrush ended up on the Rollercoaster of Death, and giving Elaine more to do), as well as another musical number (Google “Plank of Love lyrics”). I recall Chuck Jordan’s blog grumbling about unrealistic crunch-time deadlines at LucasArts, so Even aside from that problem, I find Parts V and VI more frustrating than the Antiquarian does. Part V is where the game feels the need to answer the questions left over from MI2, after dodging them for so long, and while I love the phrase “Carnival of the Damned”, I don’t care for the carnival itself. It feels like most of the exuberant energy of the earlier parts of the game drains away at this point. But those earlier sections are marvelous. For a lot of the game’s creators, working on a new Monkey Island game was their dream job, and their joy at doing it comes across in their work. They had a knack for taking a funny idea and spinning it out as far as it would go, while keeping it feeling fresh: the proliferating chickens, the ridiculous songs, or my favorite, the Plunder Island Naturalist Society plaques. I don’t think the series ever recaptured this feeling. Later games in the series all have funny moments, but they didn’t make me burst out laughing like the unseen fight in the governor’s mansion in SMI, the Phatt Island Library card catalogue in MI2, or the snake crossing in CMI. (You may claim it’s nostalgia for games I experienced earlier in life, except I encountered the MI games in an extremely unconventional order). In fact, I’ll court even more controversy and say this is the one point in the Monkey Island series where all LucasArts’ trademark traits are present. SMI has that same exuberant spirit, and unlike any of its sequels, it carries it through from beginning to end. But its technical imitations meant it couldn’t express that sensibility in its artwork the way later LucasArts comedies did. MI2 was the first game to have that cartoon sensibility in its art, but despite some riotously funny gags, its mean streak means it doesn’t have the same overall élan. The early parts of CMI have it all. It lasted only a moment, less than the length of one game, but what a glorious moment it was. Reply Derek April 19, 2024 Edit: “I recall Chuck Jordan’s blog grumbling about unrealistic crunch-time deadlines from his time at LucasArts, so I don’t doubt that the Christmas deadline was the reason for the trucation.” Reply Marco April 19, 2024 General agreement from me on everything said so far. I make no secret that I’m not the biggest fan of LucasArts, but this is the game of theirs I like best. It does go odd and abrupt at the end, but the beautiful rendering and design of the early sections more than makes up for it. Special shoutout for two characters: Murray, as Guybrush’s on-again, off-again sidekick; and lemonade chiseller turned gun salesman Kenny (voiced, I now see, by Gary Coleman). Reply Jack Brounstein April 19, 2024 Two quick typos: * “a member of the testing team proposed implementing multiplayer ship combat as an ‘the greatest Easter egg of all time for any game.’ ” has a superfluous “an” immediately before the quote * “Doh” is more properly spelled “d’oh”—there’s some dispute about this, but that’s the spelling the Simpsons team uses (at least, when they’re not calling the sound just “annoyed grunt”). Reply Jimmy Maher April 19, 2024 Thanks! Reply Alex Smith April 19, 2024 “ the spirited and fetching lady pirate Elaine” While Elaine may have a little larceny in her heart, she is not a pirate. She is the governor of the Tri-Island area. “ (Pirate: “Now I know what filth and stupidity really are!” Guybrush: “I’m glad to hear you attended your family reunion.”)” That is a Secret of Monkey Island insult. Curse of Monkey Island added the wrinkle that the taunt and comeback must rhyme. “Annoyed grunt” is spelled “d’oh,” with an apostrophe, not “doh.” Reply Jimmy Maher April 19, 2024 Thanks! Reply Sniffnoy April 19, 2024 > While Elaine may have a little larceny in her heart, she is not a pirate. I dunno, she seems to be portrayed as a pirate sometimes… is there really nothing in the games calling her a pirate? I thought there was in the first game, at least. Reply Alex Smith April 19, 2024 She is not portrayed as a pirate in the first three games at all. I can’t speak for the later games, but any such portrayal in those would not inform Curse. She is certainly not called a pirate in the first game. In fact, the only reference to Elaine and piracy in Secret of Monkey Island is that she has recently banned pirates from her mansion because of the whole LeChuck incident that turned him into a zombie (he fell in love with her, she told him to drop dead, so he did). Reply arcanetrivia April 20, 2024 True, she’s not made out to be a pirate at least until the end of Escape from Monkey Island, where she pleads with, uh, someone else (spoilers to say who? do we care about spoilers in a 24-year-old game?) to take over the governorship of Mêlée Island so she can go off adventuring with Guybrush. In Tales of Monkey Island she can be affected by the Pox that, by the game’s own stated narrative rules, only afflicts pirates per se (this is actually made a plot point of, when someone Guybrush thinks might be affected, isn’t), so one might think, she’s become a pirate, or is at least pirate-adjacent. But in any case, up to the beginning of Curse, I wouldn’t call her a pirate. Reply Guillermo Crespi April 19, 2024 Hi Jimmy! Here’s a little bit of info you’re probably aware of, but in case it’s useful, here goes: In all fairness, it wasn’t entirely Ahern and Ackley’s idea to go the “Guybrush has been hexed” route. That path (obscure and undefined as it was) was already set at the end of MI2. If you wait long enough once credits roll over the Amusement Park background you’re shown a small scene with Elaine standing next to the Inky Island hole Guybrush had fell into, and she says: “I wonder what’s keeping Guybrush? I hope LeChuck hasn’t cast some horrible SPELL over him or anything” (CAPS not mine, they’re in the original game) I’ve always taken that awkward line as someone’s attempt to leave some sort of trail that would lead them out of that narrative dead-end (like Spock whispering the word “remember” to McCoy’s ear before walking into his death – which wouldn’t last long). I can’t imagine Gilbert being too happy with it (as it seemed to go against the shock and ambiguity of what we had just seen), though I can’t either imagine that line being included without his approval. Maybe someone persuaded him to leave a little something that could help them write themselves out of that corner, should the need arise? In any case, Ahern and Ackley took that SPELL idea and kinda went along with it in their game. Reply Jimmy Maher April 20, 2024 That does put a slightly different spin on things. I had no idea it was there. I added a footnote to the article. Thanks! Reply Mateus Fedozzi April 19, 2024 I was going to say you were too kind on the game, but your writing exhales such unusual sweetness this time, making it so very clear this is a game you truly loves to this day, that I am left with nothing really relevant to say besides the fact that the world became a sadder place without a LucasArts around. Reply Patrick Ingram April 19, 2024 For a long time, I felt that this game – while very good – was a bit of a disappointment by going back to the two islands setup of the first game instead of the second game’s more open structure. In general, I find LeChuck’s Revenge to be the best of the first three games, though I admit that Maher and I obviously have very different tastes for humor. This retrospective seems to foreshadow that Maher doesn’t like Grim Fandango. That’s a shame, not that I expected anything different. Reply arcanetrivia April 20, 2024 For myself (I’m not Jimmy heh) I do like Grim Fandango, but even setting aside its very frustrating linear-access inventory, I was stymied by its puzzles in some places in a way that I wasn’t the first time I played Curse of Monkey Island. As far as “solvability” I think there’s more knocks to be made against GF than against Curse, even in Mega-Monkey mode. Reply Christian April 19, 2024 I thought it was 256 colours, not thousands Reply Jimmy Maher April 20, 2024 Right you are. Thanks! Reply Andrew McCarthy April 19, 2024 Great article! A couple corrections: “By way of compensation, this latest LucasArts pixel art was to be more luscious than anything that had come out of the studio before, taking advantage of a revamped SCUMM engine that could now display thousands of colors at once at a resolution of 640 X 480. (How strange to think that this technology had been born on a 16-color Commodore 64!)” Even with CMI, SCUMM still ran in 256 colors. The leap to high color wouldn’t happen until Grim Fandango; this was one of GF lead programmer Bret Mogilefsky’s reasons for designing a new engine, in fact. “The world-class cartoon-animation studio that the company’s adventure division had become was wound down after this game’s release, and Larry Ahern and Jonathan Ackley were never given a chance to lead a project such as this one again, despite having acquitted themselves so well here.” As Larry Ahern has mentioned in his video interview with Daniel Albu, they did work on a game idea called Vanishing Act for a while. But it didn’t get very far, and when Jonathan Ackley left the company Ahern decided to switch to working on an abortive Full Throttle sequel instead. (Not to be confused with the other cancelled Full Throttle sequel known as “Hell on Wheels”, lad by Sean Clark, which unlike the first was announced to the public before being cancelled.) Reply Kaitain April 20, 2024 I’m with you on “LeChuck’s Revenge”. It was a huge disappointment to me, and I agree about the mean-spiritedness of the whole thing. When I played “Monkey Island” I felt like the authors were on my side, and wanted me to have fun. In MI2 I felt that they wanted me to feel like a loser throughout. Lots of irritating puzzles (including that bloody hynotized monkey wrench idiocy), Elaine making the player (as Guybrush) feel like a creepy stalker, and that clever-yet-awful ending. I liked “Curse” a LOT more. It’s always seemed weird to me that its creators seemed to grasp the spirit of the original game a lot more than the people who actually made the original game did in the sequel. Reply Ignacio April 20, 2024 Great article, thanks! Minor typo: But IT when it’s done this well, who cares? Reply Jimmy Maher April 20, 2024 Thanks! Reply stepped pyramids April 20, 2024 Great article, and it really was a lovely game. It’s “venial” (forgivable) sins, rather than “venal” (susceptible to bribery). Reply Jimmy Maher April 20, 2024 Thanks! Reply Alex April 20, 2024 I was a small kid when I played MI2 for the first time. I had to use a walkthrough and ask my brother for help, but I loved it the first time and I loved it time and time again. It has a very special place in my heart. That being said, even as a child the ending got me confused, but I just shrugged my shoulders. However, there is a really nice easteregg when you wait after everyone left the screen. Eventually, a long list of suggestions will pop up telling you what to do after beating the game. Basically, you are told to turn off the screen and do something creative. Along with the nice music playing in the background this always left me with a good feeling and made the ending worthwile. Now, I remember the big news when MI3 came out many years later. I don´t know when I played it, but I remember that I liked it, but it never moved me in any kind of way that the second one did. And this didn´t change until l today. If I´m being honest, I think that Part 2 is the only one I really connect with. But I´m happy for everyone that saw something in Part 1 or Part 3 that I didn´t :) Part 4: Yeah, you really could sense that someone tried to emulate the spirit ot the franchise without really understanding it´s essence. I was so disappointed that I quit just about three hours into the game. Reply Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

For some reason I never quite understood, it wasn’t that well received when it came out. My stance on this one hasn’t changed in 27 years and I firmly believe it is the pinnacle of the genre : incredible art, hilarious, crazy but somehow logical puzzles, great music, and above all extraordinarily well written. Very very few games had me laugh in front of my computer. And don’t forget the brilliant voice acting. I’ve just bought the latest title in the series but haven’t played it yet - I somehow fear it won’t be able to match COMI. I will also be introducing my kids to this incredible work of art - they will never hear about this from their friends at school, and I feel this is typically the kind of thing I can and probably should share as a parent. Lucas folks, thanks for making this game. reply probably_wrong 11 hours agoparentI think the reason CoMI wasn't well received was a combination of adventure games being on the way out (so not a great sale for casual gamers) and Ron Gilbert not being involved in it (so not a great pitch for fans either). But I have to agree that some of my favorite Monkey Island jokes came from this game, and I appreciate their attempt at \"straightening\" the ending of MI2. As for the latest MI... it is my hot take that I would have been better off not playing it. It's competently made and has some good innovations for the point-and-click genre, but not even the characters seem like they want to be there. Then again, it has good ratings so other opinions exist. reply endgame 8 hours agorootparentCoMI felt to me like a game made by Monkey Island fans, rather than coming from an original place. I don't mean that it's a fangame, but that SoMI 1 and 2 had been out long enough that people had played them, gone into the industry, and worked on CoMI with an idea of \"what a Monkey Island game 'should' be like\". When I played it I felt there were a lot of structural similarities to previous games (let's do insult swordfighting again) and obligatory call-outs (like Stan). reply taeric 7 hours agoparentprevI don't remember it being poorly received. Just a lot more excitement over 3d games, at the time. Also multiplayer games were on the rise. reply pshc 15 hours agoprev> It nails that mixture of whimsy, cleverness, and sweetness that has made The Secret of Monkey Island arguably the most beloved point-and-click adventure game of all time. > During the latter 1990s, when most computers games were still made by and for a fairly homogeneous cohort of young men, too much ludic humor tried to get by on transgression rather than wit; this was a time of in-groups punching — usually punching down — on out-groups. I’m happy to say that The Curse of Monkey Island‘s humor is nothing like that. Well said. Game has aged beautifully. reply Gormo 13 hours agoparentIs that really true, though? I can't think of any significant examples of games from the '80s or '90s that involved \"in-groups punching... on out-groups\", unless the out-groups in question were space aliens, nazis, fantasy monsters, hostile AIs, or the like.

There was actually quite a bit of dislike for all of the above, and they were seen at the time as the exception rather that the norm.

Even when she needs to be saved, when you get there, she already saved herself (in MI 1 or 2, I don’t remember). reply Gormo 13 hours agorootparentThe adventure game market wasn't quite so male-dominated, especially where Sierra was concerned, with a large number of female game designers, and multiple influential games with well-developed female protagonists 1-2 years before even the original Monkey Island came out. reply dylan-m 14 hours agorootparentprevI adored this in Return to Monkey Island, as well. Elaine and Guybrush just have a … functional relationship. They love and support each other and they get along well.

I found it refreshing. reply Tarsul 13 hours agorootparentactually, I found their relationship in Return to Monkey Island really weird. In that Elaine forgives basically everything that Guybrush does, even in the last act.

I've been going back and playing point & click adventures like Grim Fandango and Broke Age. IMO that genre didn't age well. So many interactions are counterintuitive and I inevitably feel like I have to read a guide in order to proceed with the narrative. reply atribecalledqst 6 hours agoparentPoint and click games (and puzzle-based interactive fiction games while we're at it) tend to lose me right around the halfway point. The puzzles start to get more difficult and I just can't figure out how to solve them. Could just be a matter of patience, I tend to give up after 1-2 hours at most if I just find myself rotating between locations not knowing what to do next. But I think the genre's reputation for being obtuse is pretty well-deserved. Broken Age was actually interesting for me, because it's the game I got closest to finishing without a walkthrough. I only needed to consult one once, for the last puzzle that you encounter in the game. Consulting a walkthrough generally ruins the game for me so once I use one once, my patience threshold for using it again drops significantly. At that point how much I enjoy a game depends on how much I like the characters, story, etc. Grim Fandango is one of those I still look back fondly for that reason, even though it lost me WAY earlier than halfway. ----- Somewhat of a tangent, but I've always wondered if this genre of games is good for development of mathematical thinking. Like, in an adventure game you usually know the broad strokes of what you need to do, but you need to solve lots of puzzles to get there. Something I've always struggled with in math is the ability to think laterally, think of analogues, lemmas, auxiliary problems, etc. that can help prove a theorem. It's always felt to me like the two struggles are different forms of the same issue with my cognition. reply solardev 13 hours agoparentprevEven back then, excessive \"pixel hunting\" was a frequent complaint of the genre. You basically just had to click around randomly and try different inventory item permutations by trial and error until something happens. On the other hand, modern Games like Baldur's Gate 3, while not really an adventure game, gives you so many different ways of solving each puzzle or encounter. It's never pre scripted to only one solution, but you can really use your imagination. Relevant tropes: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PixelHunt https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoonLogicPuzzle reply Agingcoder 12 hours agorootparentI was a huge adventure game fan back in the 90s, and I also completed BG3 a few months ago ( it took me a solid 6 months to finish the game ). Quite frankly, I truly think there are no puzzles whatsoever in bg3. Very very very occasionally you need object X to satisfy character Y, but that’s about it. I think this is partly due to the game changing directions based on what you do ( so you can’t get stuck and therefore there’s no puzzle solving !) , but I never had the same feeling I had with monkey island, fate of Atlantis etc. reply solardev 12 hours agorootparentMaybe they're not strictly \"puzzles\" in the traditional LucasArts or Myst sense, but maybe more like \"problems\". That is, you have a lot of agency as a player in determining the outcome of your quests, companions, world events, etc., and you're not tied into any one way of achieving those. Given a quest, it's never just \"gather X, put them together in Y fashion, then use them to Z\". There's almost always a way to talk your way to a different solution, or use violence, or subterfuge, or a spell, or shapeshifting, or jumping/flying over the location, etc. I wasn't arguing that BG3 is a puzzle/adventure game (sorry if that was unclear), but that it doesn't suffer from that \"only one esoteric and preposterous solution\" that 90s-era adventure games often had (looking at you, Sierra Entertainment especially, with puzzles like needing to stick a banana into a jetpack to stop a killer robot: https://spacequest.fandom.com/wiki/W-D40#Game_Involvement... and that was the only way to proceed). By contrast, in BG3 you can beat the game in many different ways, leading to completely different outcomes (and playtimes). I did a physics-based playthrough that mostly just shoved and threw people around and off cliffs, with no idea who they were or what they wanted from me, but the game gave me the freedom to do that. It's also possible to do a mostly peaceful playthrough with a lot of talking (yawn). The Owlbear cave is a good example (no spoilers... but there's a lot of different outcomes for the mother and child owlbear, depending on your party makeup and actions etc.) Games these days are a lot better at giving you different ways to solve a situation (or the entire game), not just following a strictly linear puzzle/narrative/questline. It's like the opposite of the \"Moon Logic Puzzle\" trope. reply Agingcoder 12 hours agorootparentAh ! I had indeed misunderstood you, thanks a lot for the clarification. We definitely agree. I thoroughly enjoyed bg3, and remember feeling no resistance because things would play out the way I wanted them to happen. Apart from the occasional fighting parts, I’ve wondered quite a bit about what makes bg3 a challenge - and I still don’t have the answer, probably because there’s little to no challenge in bg3. I’ve decided though that the game is not about the technical challenge ( or any challenge for that matter ) but about the fact that you can freely bend the story to your wishes , and do things the way you want, and the problems you solve are the ones that, to some extent, you choose to create / address - what you call ‘problems’ and I agree with you. This makes the game structurally different from COMI ( which is about solving puzzles so about meeting some kind of challenge ), but neither more nor less enjoyable- they’re just different games. reply t_mann 10 hours agoparentprevI think the mistake here was using guides. I used guides when I first played them and I remember feeling similar about them. I replayed some games again over the years, without guides, after enough time had passed so that I couldn't remember much anymore - it was a completely different experience, and much more enjoyable.

Though many are not well-structured to avoid spoilers when you drop into the middle of them. I don't do a ton of adventure gaming, but I have gone through most of the episodic Sam & Max games. I estimate about 1 walkthrough consult per 2 games overall, and about a 50/50 split between \"oh crap I should have gotten that myself\" and \"oh, I was never going to get that\" results (with the occasional \"oh I was right and I just didn't click on the right thing or notice the tiny little widget\" that really makes me glad I just looked).

The exaggerated art style didn't mesh with that of the first two games. The art style of the first two is of course whimsical, but it's within the realm of photorealism. MI3, however, leans heavily into the Chuck Jones style of cartoons, with huge heads and spindly bodies, against super-exaggerated backgrounds where not a single straight corner can be seen. It's not just that Guybrush looks completely different in MI3 — he's certainly not a tall, lanky fellow in MI1-2 (though in the \"remastered\" versions LucasArts retconned his look) — he feels like an entirely new and different character. The world also feels like a different universe entirely. It's a different island, sure, but it just doesn't feel like the dark and atmospheric environment of the first two games. There's overall a weird lack of continuity here, and the heritage of Day of the Tentacle is apparent. DotT is of course about as Chunk Jones-y as you can get, with a huge dab of the wacky art style of Ren & Stimpy and Animaniacs. MI3 feels designed by people who wanted to do their own thing. What's really weird and off-putting is the art style of MI6. I don't know what they were thinking.

    "title": "Enhancing Connectivity: Multipath TCP Comes to Linux",
    "originLink": "https://www.mptcp.dev/",
    "originBody": "Multipath TCP or MPTCP is an extension to the standard TCP and is described in RFC 8684. It allows a device to make use of multiple interfaces at once to send and receive TCP packets over a single MPTCP connection. MPTCP can aggregate the bandwidth of multiple interfaces or prefer the one with lowest latency, it also allows a fail-over if one path is down, and the traffic is seamlessly reinjected on other paths. Technically, when a new socket is created with the IPPROTO_MPTCP protocol (Linux-specific), a subflow (or path) is created. This subflow consists of a regular TCP connection that is used to transmit data through one interface. Additional subflows can be negotiated later between the hosts. For the remote host to be able to detect the use of MPTCP, a new field is added to the TCP option field of the underlying TCP subflow. This field contains, amongst other things, a MP_CAPABLE option that tells the other host to use MPTCP if it is supported. If the remote host or any middlebox in between does not support it, the returned SYN+ACK packet will not contain MPTCP options in the TCP option field. In that case, the connection will be “downgraded” to plain TCP, and it will continue with a single path. This behavior is made possible by two internal components: Path Manager: Manages subflows from creation to deletion, and also address announcements. Typically, it is the client side that initiates subflows, and the server side that announces additional addresses via the ADD_ADDR and REMOVE_ADDR options. graph LR; C_1(fa:fa-mobile) S_1((fa:fa-cloud)) C_1 -. \"Potential subflow\" -.- S_1 C_1S_1 C_1 ~~~|\"Subflows creation\"| C_1 S_1 ~~~|\"Addresses announcement\"| S_1 linkStyle 0 stroke:orange; linkStyle 1 stroke:green; As of Linux v5.19, there are two path managers, controlled by the net.mptcp.pm_type sysctl knob: the in-kernel one (type 0) where the same rules are applied for all the connections (see: ip mptcp) ; and the userspace one (type 1), controlled by a userspace daemon (i.e. mptcpd) where different rules can be applied for each connection. Packet Scheduler: In charge of selecting which available subflow(s) to use to send the next data packet. It can decide to maximize the use of the available bandwidth, only to pick the path with the lower latency, or any other policy depending on the configuration. graph LR; A_2(fa:fa-user) PS{PacketScheduler} I_21(subflow 1) I_22(subflow 2) A_2 == \"fa:fa-box fa:fa-box fa:fa-box\" ==> PS PS -- \"fa:fa-box fa:fa-box\" --> I_21 PS -- \"fa:fa-box\" --> I_22 PS ~~~|\"Packets distribution between subflows\"| PS As of Linux v6.8, there is only one packet scheduler, controlled by sysctl knobs in net.mptcp. Features As of Linux v6.10, major features of MPTCP include: Support of the IPPROTO_MPTCP protocol in socket() system calls. Fallback from MPTCP to TCP if the peer or a middlebox do not support MPTCP. Path management using either an in-kernel or userspace path manager. Socket options that are commonly used with TCP sockets. Debug features including MIB counters, diag support (used by the ss command), and tracepoints. See the ChangeLog for more details.

It made so much sense back then, when mobile apps were not that robust to networks changing, I assumed it's going to get adopted in no time due to how much of a ux improvement it would have been back in the day. It's incredibly depressing that this gained barely any traction in the last 10 years, and kernel options are appearing just recently, after everyone has wrapped they http calls in multiple retry handlers, and mobile operating systems have abstracted network connectivity to the point where it feels more like you are using zeromq rather than tcp. reply toast0 14 hours agoparentI wanted to like it, and Apple included it in iOS, but supporting it on real servers was going to be too hard... When I was deployed on FreeBSD with no load balancers, there weren't recent patches. And even if there were, I'd need to do some serious work to avoid advertising the private network ips as alternates... When I was on Linux behind a load balancer, it's too complex to get the streams to the right place. And the load balancer doesn't want to do it anyway. Processing two streams together involves a lot of complexity in a high throughput code path. It's a lot of risk, and you've got to reboot for changes. And then you do all that work and it only benefits iOS users, who tend to be on better networks anyway. reply DEADMINCE 2 hours agorootparent> iOS users, who tend to be on better networks anyway.

[1]https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/18780 reply RulerOf 8 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds like this would have taken off if it were added to various managed cloud load balancers based on what you're saying. The only question I have is if it opens up a different can of worms even if you've got a magic box terminating layer 7 for you or not. Never dug deep enough into mptcp myself to know. reply toast0 8 hours agorootparentI think it's a no brainer if it's no effort or small effort (set a socket option on the client, somehow)... but it's a big effort to support it in a large load balancing situation. If you balance your load balancers with ECMP, I don't know if you can get two client streams to the same mptcp terminating place. If you've optimized the heck out of your tcp flows, this throws a wrench in there, because the second stream is likely to get hashed into a different nic queue, and then you have communication between cpus to move forward on the logical stream. It would have been really handy though, and solve real issues with real users. Edit to add: it could also solve some issues on private networking / interserver networking I saw... although the contention would be a much bigger problem on higher bandwidth streams. On networks with link aggregation, while there are many paths from one host to another, usually path selection is by hashing the connection 5-tuple {src ip, dst ip, protocol, src port, dst port} so a long running tcp connection remains on the same path for the duration, if a path segment has high loss/corruption or is congested, MPTCP could help if you had an extra connection that hit a different path. Otherwise, you need to find the segment and get network operations to fix it; it's not easy to figure that out (i had to write a tool to sample and find port combinations with trouble and then a patch for mtr to run a trace with fixed ports) and then you still need to reconnect your affected tcp sockets unless you can get a quick response from net ops (sometimes they can check error stats once the right devices are pointed out to them, and then replacing a cable/fiber often helps, or disconnecting it during investigation can help the traffic flow across the redundant links) reply vitus 7 hours agorootparent> If you balance your load balancers with ECMP, I don't know if you can get two client streams to the same mptcp terminating place. At Google, we do something similar with QUIC and connection migration. Our mechanism for ensuring these hit the same backend is Maglev [0], where we use the QUIC connection ID for hashing purposes in software. (Our routers still mostly use ECMP based on the 5-tuple, so being able to consistently hash to the same backend across multiple LB instances is crucial.) > if a path segment has high loss/corruption or is congested, MPTCP could help if you had an extra connection that hit a different path. Incidentally, we also have a family of internal mechanisms that do this, although we don't rely on MPTCP. (We instead twiddle some other bits in the packet that we make sure our routers use for hashing, at least for RPCs between prod machines.) This inspired some of the connection migration work in our QUIC implementation [1], wherein we can migrate to a different ephemeral port if we detect issues with the current path.

How would i set up rules on firewall if I don't know how to distingush the connections? reply mlyle 12 hours agorootparentThere's two separate ideas here: * Where to send a frame to get to the other side of the connection * Whose connection this is. TCP combined the two, because we didn't have mobile clients or a lot of multihomed systems that would benefit from distinguishing them. Also, every octet in the header counted. In practice, this means we have to keep building a lot of infrastructure on top of TCP (or parallel to it, in datagram protocols) to handle retries and splitting flows well. In turn, these things are completely opaque to the network and it's difficult to write rules about them. Whereas if we had different packet fields for \"where am I sending this packet right now\" and \"whose flow does this belong to\"? we could write better firewall rules, have less infrastructure built on top of TCP, and have better typical application performance. reply zare_st 12 hours agorootparentprevBut the stuff that carries TCP is IP. That's why TCP can work seamlessly, because it uses identification from a previous layer. Consider I bind a server to an ID, and not IP:port, the operating system running it must know how to communicate that via IP, so there will be a corellation map somewhere and that map needs to be synchronized between all peers that wish to host the roaming server. Otherwise you're just switching port (16-bit) value to arbitrary 32-bit identifier. reply mlyle 12 hours agorootparentIf TCP didn't use L3 source and destination addresses to distinguish connections, it could be more easily taught to deal with: * Clients roaming between L3 addresses * Clients/servers with multiple L3 addresses reply alexey-salmin 1 hour agorootparentBut... it doesn't? TCP has no notion of IP address in the protocol, only the port. TCP with changing IPs can work e.g. on top of an ip-ip tunnel with applications not being aware at all. reply EvanAnderson 12 hours agorootparentprevThe protocol would have to handle binding the network to the transport. MPTCP and SCTP both handle that via registering and un-register network layer endpoints. This parallel universe TCP would be the same in that regard. (I did say I was oversimplifying... reply eptcyka 11 hours agorootparentprevHow do you even firewall such a protocol? reply alerighi 12 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that the TCP/IP model stops at level 4, and if we consider TCP a protocol of transport, it shouldn't do that. In the OSI model what you talk about is level 5, that is session, but in TCP/IP there is no such level, thus it must be handled by the application (e.g. trough a session cookie, in HTTP). reply wmf 8 hours agorootparentSlavish adherence to theoretical models is a recipe for failure. Even worse, the OSI model was developed in the 1970s before successful internetworks existed so it's not informed by experience; it's mostly made up. reply klysm 10 hours agorootparentprevI disagree. There’s no reason TCP couldn’t work like that. See QUIC for example reply suprjami 6 hours agoprevI work supporting, debugging, fixing the Linux network stack and drivers. I am amazed how little adoption this has seen.

Wouldn’t it make most sense for the kernel to do it transparently for every TCP connection so that it can make more global decisions about path aggregation / link preference? reply brenns10 15 hours agoparentMy understanding is that it was basically a condition enforced by the maintainers of the Linux TCP / networking subsystems. If you look at the initial upstreaming discussions[1], this was setup as a ground rule. If you look at the older multipath TCP implementation, prior to the upstreaming, it was intended to be fully transparent to the application, which I think makes more sense for the intent of the protocol. Sure, in many cases MPTCP may be better with application-guided logic, but having a standard system approach (e.g. establish sub-flows on an LTE connection for automatic failover, but don't send any data along those sub-flows) would have worked for 95% of cases. [1] https://lore.kernel.org/all/alpine.OSX.2.21.1707181728570.11... reply matttbe 1 hour agorootparentYes, that's correct. In the Linux kernel, it would not be possible to switch to MPTCP by default.

Either it would be passed correctly, or it would fall back to single-path TCP safely. Generally, so long as a middlebox passes through unknown options unmodified, and does not try to enforce that the TCP sequence space it sees is contiguous, MPTCP should work through that middlebox.

Also, if the ISP at home can do 10Gbps, 1Gbps, 300 Mbps whatever... I want to be able to use them with a single path, so there is no gain using multiple paths. Eventually, when I have cable+wifi connected at the same time, I use to force one of both, cannot see a reason to prefer using both at the same time. Maybe the latency thing? Never had that issue at home, but could understand that usage case \"just use the network segment with less latency to reach $thing\". reply matttbe 1 hour agorootparentSome ISPs in Europe are using MPTCP for people being too far from the street cabinets. Typically, for people in the countryside, with < 50 Mbps. Thanks to a transparent proxy installed in the home gateway, and servers in the ISP's network, they can combine both the fixed and cellular networks, and use the fixed one in priority. MPTCP can also be very interesting for mobility use-cases, even when one network is used at a time, e.g. switching from WiFi to cellular, or different cellular networks in the train, etc. reply apitman 15 hours agoprev [–] Is this something that middle boxes tend to support in practice? reply flounder3 14 hours agoparent [–] We found that most proxies/firewalls (90%+ ?

You aren't doing anything meaningful by giving me yet another fuzzy robot question machine. Just let me search the web. Queries in, web pages out. reply unsupp0rted 17 hours agoparentI just don't want to search the web. I have questions and I want answers- searching the web is an intermediate step, not the end solution. I have Question X and the answer isn't to surface \"Blog Post Y\"... it's the content of Blog Post Y I need, and only the subset of the content that answers my question, perhaps synthesized with the content of 5 other blog posts, a couple scientific papers and a recent press release. We're now in this temporary zone where \"just searching the web\" is still the optimal way to get answers, while search engine companies are piling into other stuff. But very shortly that other stuff will become our go-to. reply vector_spaces 17 hours agorootparentSometimes, often, I really just want to search the web. I just want to see what's out there! I have some vague ideas that I am trying to make more coherent and give sharper edges too, and I'm exploring the space those ideas fit into to see what others have done with them. Often I don't have a specific question in mind, and trying to frame my query as a coherent question will be limiting. As another poster commented, don't take away my agency by trying to predict my intent! Better yet, don't try to force intent on me. reply moshun 13 hours agorootparentArguably Google has been taking your agency away and predicting your intent for the last decade at a minimum.

Phind tries to ameliorate this a bit by providing a set of links where the summarized data comes from, but most people likely won't even click on these links. It's going to be rather demotivating when your site's traffic suddenly gets cut in half. reply ta1243 17 hours agorootparentIf you talk to a collegue and say \"what should I use to do X\", and they say \"use FooX\", because they read it in a book last year, is that unethical? Most of the top results in search engines are terrible, mainly because of the SEO spam We'll eventually reach that with AI of course, but for now we haven't. reply MadcapJake 16 hours agorootparentprevSearch is pretty horrible these days imo. My main fear with AI becoming our go-to information retrieval platform is how can we be sure that the answer is objective truth without any slant? Shouldn't there be an ethical obligation that a model should not only fact check but also provide alternative theories? We lost that somewhere in journalism but we could regain that if we prioritized that the thinking and deciding still needs to occur human-side. reply lelandfe 16 hours agorootparentGo try to ask any of these hosted LLM bots about sexual topics to find out how far from objectivity we are. I earned a stern warning after trying to write a dirty pun with ChatGPT Imagine trying to do research on sexually transmitted diseases, or trying to self-educate about sex. Unfortunately the limits put in place are quite coarse today. reply awill88 16 hours agorootparentprevAt this point, anybody here likely has had the privilege of being educated to prefer primary sources of information over secondary, tertiary, etc. The indexing feature that search engines for years provided was a side-effect and benefit of the internet’s success. There have always been challenges with this as it is not immediately clear what should be treated as “primary source” information — it takes time and skill — the user in this model is accountable for their own exploration and consumption of other peoples’ knowledge. AI seems to be purposefully at odds with that. So, for me, the distrust and avoidance is well-placed. That said, it’s a powerful tool that has a place in the world, but I hope it doesn’t come at a detriment to the colloquial understanding of what it means to “search the web” reply yegg 17 hours agoparentprevThis (DuckDuckGo AI Chat) is currently separate from search results, and in any case we plan to offer settings to turn off any AI search integrations, similarly for how we do for instant answers and ads. reply Zhyl 17 hours agorootparentI really like the way this has been added to the UI.

You are searching for answers, to get to which you'd have to dig through piles of web pages for an hour. Technology already exists to give you a direct answer in 95% of the time (with references), it just results in fewer ads shown to you, so search engines aren't interested in integrating it properly. reply flemishgun 17 hours agorootparentThis you-know-better-than-me mindset is why all technology is converging to garbage. I can't speak for OP, but for me, you are half correct: I am indeed ultimately searching for answers, but I want the piles of web pages for an hour, and that is how I will find my answer. I don't like it when systems remove my agency by believing they can correctly predict my intent. (They can't.) reply sodality2 17 hours agorootparentBut there is no agency being removed here. You are being given more options by adding a button to chat if you so desire. It’s very small and unobtrusive reply amlib 16 hours agorootparentAds, sponsoring and SEO spam were also very unobtrusive for a while. A few decades passed and we have to sift trough all the garbage to find anything relevant in our searches, it's very likely that search engines will push harder and harder for these AI assistants while making finding organic content and authoritative sources even harder, resulting in it being nearly impossible to do research by yourself rather then trough an AI that has god knows what bias and perhaps subtle ad driven bias into it. reply rchaud 11 hours agorootparentprevTake a look at a Google results page from 2009 and then from 2012 onwards. \"Unobtrusive\" is clearly a matter of opinion. reply sodality2 11 hours agorootparentSure, it’s subjective, but are you disagreeing that the new DDG chat button is unobtrusive? reply ein0p 17 hours agorootparentprevIn a lot of cases today’s AI systems can easily predict your intent once they accumulate enough context about you. Not in all, but when they predict incorrectly it’s easy to correct them using natural language. And nobody is removing the option of digging in the pile, it’s just that I don’t see why anyone would want to, in most cases. I certainly don’t - I got better things to do with my time. reply rchaud 11 hours agorootparentprevThere is an inverse relation between sites with ads, and sites that contain useful information that require time to look through. Open access journals, StackExchange, product support messageboards....none of these have ads. In fact, it's the sites peddling trivial BS that are chock to the brim with ads. reply kube-system 17 hours agoparentprevThis is an intermediary step to what will ultimately upend search: LLMs parsing web search results and giving you succinct results without you having to read them yourself. If you haven't tried Arc Search's \"Browse for Me\" feature, you should. It isn't perfect yet, but I think it's clear that's the direction of search in the future. reply apantel 8 hours agorootparentThe issue is LLM’s also generating the web results. Garbage in, garbage out. The real problem is maintaining the ability to find the ground of real knowledge. reply kube-system 8 hours agorootparentGarbage content on the web existed long before LLMs were the new hot thing on the street. There are ways to weight or even exclude results that are poor quality, and that'll still be necessary. reply dkersten 17 hours agoparentprevAgreed. Additionally, I don’t actually want to talk to my computer for most use cases. When I do, then I’ll use a dedicated service like ChatGPT, but for most other take, I really really don’t want a chat interface.

It's concerning in general to see so many companies throwing so much money at this without business models.

This move will increase operating costs by a considerable amount. Is the company sufficiently profitable that it can eat the loss or is this a gamble that culminates in a PE takeover? I get that duck duck go is in a tough position since LLM search is increasing popular among users, but without a business model that balances out this feels dubious. E.G this is the marketing campaign before everyone is going to be herded into the paid tier Privacy Pro? reply yegg 18 hours agorootparentYes, we are sufficiently profitable and have in fact been profitable for a decade. Our mission is to provide easy access to privacy, and offering things free where we can is key to doing that well.

It's quite expensive paying 10 bucks for search results only. reply salad-tycoon 17 hours agorootparentYeah but we’re getting t shirts. reply margalabargala 17 hours agorootparentprevHonestly I doubt it. Considering the speed at which models are improving, and more importantly, the speed at which models have begun improving per unit compute, I would bet that AI models at least as good as ChatGPT 3.5 will be free to use like this forever. Right now there is so much interest/demand, and so much money sloshing around to provide it, that it's easy to find. By the time the AI market cools off a little bit, I would expect that the cost to run a model meeting the current quality of ChatGPT 3.5 will be next-to-free. Will near-state-of-the-art models be free forever? Absolutely not. But state-of-the-art circa late 2022 models are probably the quality basement, and free models will be at least that good. reply thih9 18 hours agorootparentprevAs a user I dislike this kind of temporary free products. It feels dishonest and unreliable to me. reply maltalex 18 hours agorootparentIt's just a theory.

Sure they get some SERPS from them, but DDG abstracts in front of Bing's API using your query without passing your data. reply JAlexoid 18 hours agoparentprevThe privacy comes from the lack of tracking your interests and tailoring the search results to the preexisting interests. They just don't collect the private data in the first place. reply ricardo81 18 hours agorootparentThat's one way of looking at it. Another way is that your PII like your IP hitting a MS server and searches being returned for that searcher are heavily correlated. They can't serve results like https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ftsa&q=shops+near+me&ia=web and return shops within miles of me without passing that info on. IIRC they pass the /24 of your IP, but all the same, not much better. reply JAlexoid 18 hours agorootparentNo, your IP is not \"you\". It's most definitely not your PII, per se. It is PII when used in conjunction with other data(even under fairly strict GPDR rules). The party storing the IP must have means of associating that IP with you, not simply \"a city\". I mean... I can write an anonymous letter, drop it into the mailbox of my local post office and there will be a stamp of where and when that letter was mailed from. Is a post office stamp now my personal information? reply ricardo81 18 hours agorootparentEU law says your IP is PII. When you have the /24 of a searcher, and assets on X% of websites where that same IP accesses clicking through from a search, I mean, it's well known that this is not very private. And also doing xx searches a day. The idea of anonymity becomes a fantasy. reply yegg 18 hours agorootparentWe don't pass any parts of the IP to anyone. reply ricardo81 18 hours agorootparentSure, in the case of this specific tool. But the point of something being demonstrably 'private' is diminished based on your usage of the word in other contexts. And again, hitting Microsoft IPs. Microsoft have assets on many websites, so the correlation is trivial over time, no specific IP needed, no cookies needed. reply ricardo81 18 hours agoprevTried a few searches, no sources listed.

PVC cloth is less common, and I'd guess you'd qualify with a use case. (\"pvc cloth for sewing\"; it's often called \"vinyl\" instead). Anyway, it's an intentionally hard query. I tried \"tourism in mountain view, ca\" first.

    "originBody": "0 0 The Handbasket Posts I spoke with a Google worker fired for protesting a $1.2 billion contract with Israel I spoke with a Google worker fired for protesting a $1.2 billion contract with Israel \"It was a complete overreaction on their part to not only fire everyone who was and wasn't involved, but then also threaten everyone else in the company who would dare think to stand up against this...it feels like a very fascist environment.\" Marisa Kabas April 18, 2024 Quick note: I have a new piece out today on MSNBC.com about Asna Tabassum, the USC valedictorian whose commencement speech was cancelled, and the danger of silencing young voices. Read it here. Google employee protesters in New York on Tuesday (via No Tech For Apartheid) In an internal memo Wednesday, Google announced the firing of 28 employees in connection to a protest of Project Nimbus. The previous day inside Google offices in New York and California, a couple dozen employees staged a sit-in to bring awareness to the $1.2 billion Israeli government contract. It began in 2021 and provides cloud computing services to Israel—specifically, we’ve recently learned, to the Israeli Ministry of Defense—and though it has faced internal criticism since its inception, efforts against it have naturally intensified since October 7th. The memo from Google’s global head of security Chris Rackow was ominous. “If you’re one of the few who are tempted to think we’re going to overlook conduct that violates our policies,” he wrote to the company’s thousands of employees, “think again.” I was fortunate to speak with Hasan Ibraheem, one of the employees fired as part of the protest and an organizer with No Tech For Apartheid, Thursday afternoon by phone. It was shortly after news broke that more than 100 Columbia students had been arrested by police in riot gear for a pro-Palestine protest. Ibraheem is a Syria-born, West Virginia-raised 23-year-old who worked at Google for one year and eight months. It was his very first job out of college. I asked him about getting arrested, how he found out he got fired, and his personal connection to this cause. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Subscribe to The Handbasket MARISA KABAS, The Handbasket: How did you decide a sit-in was the best approach for this protest? And why now? HASAN IBRAHEEM, Former Google employee and No Tech For Apartheid organizer: That's a great question. This campaign has been going on for about three years now, ever since Project Nimbus was created. And throughout those three years, we had tried basically every avenue possible to try and get the executives to talk to us, at least have some sort of conversation with us, sent petitions. We've exhausted every avenue that we could think of possible. And during that time, we've been building up our supporters in Google—everyone who's become part of No Tech For Apartheid. And then we wanted to do the strongest action we could possibly do because we have been ignored for three years. They wouldn't even give a statement or a conversation with us. So we wanted to make it impossible for them to ignore us. KABAS: It's more than six months into the current war in Gaza and Israel. But you said this effort precedes it. Do you think the current war accelerated or intensified your efforts? IBRAHEEM: Definitely. With the current genocide that's happening in Gaza right now, more people were made aware. I joined No Tech For Apartheid only a few months ago. I wasn't even aware about Project Nimbus, and most of the people I talked to in Google weren't aware of it until a couple days ago. So, people are receptive to this once they're aware of the contract, want to make change. But yeah, it's unfortunate that it took a genocide for people to realize that Google is complicit in this. KABAS: Did you have any hesitation about organizing within your workplace? IBRAHEEM: At first I wasn't sure if organizing within the workspace was actually something that could lead to any real change. But I realized that it would be better for me to participate and make my voice heard, even if I didn't believe that the execs would drop the contract immediately. Some people need to take the first step in organizing, and whether that means risking their jobs or doing whatever, I wanted to be a part of that first group of people. KABAS: Can you tell me a little bit about what it was like being in the sit-in yesterday? What was that experience like? IBRAHEEM: We started at 12 p.m. and it was very quickly evident that the security did not want us there. They tried to get us to leave as soon as possible. They removed our banner that was hanging off the side that was visible from the stairs. And then an hour and a half in, the head of security was very visibly upset and told us “you need to leave right now.” And, as I'm sure you're aware, we were there for almost 10 hours. So an hour and a half in, him telling us that we needed to leave didn't result in anything until much later. It was a lot of waiting but we, the people who were there in New York, me and three other folks who were going to stay until arrest, we had each other and we were making speeches, we were doing chants, we were making our voices heard, making our voices as loud as possible so that we could reach as many people as possible. And lots of people came by and asked us what was going on. People were given flyers. And a lot of people were just concerned about the things that we were talking about. They expressed solidarity with us. There was a lot of support from Google employees. KABAS: And it was just you and three other people? IBRAHEEM: So in the very beginning, there were more. I think there were over 10 people sitting down. But at an hour and a half in when security told us that we needed to leave, we had different tiers of people who were willing to take risks—like risk of arrest or retaliation, which at this point seems like it wasn’t at all necessary since we all got retaliated against in the same exact way. But for the people who were doing the sit-in and didn't want to be arrested, they left as soon as security told them that they were going to escalate this issue and then it was just the four of us remaining until arrest. KABAS: So when you were finally arrested, what did security say to you? IBRAHEEM: Security said, “Alright, we've asked you to leave dozens of times now. And you can leave now, it won't be an issue, or we can have you arrested for trespassing.” And a couple of hours before we actually were arrested, they had put us—the people who were sitting down—they put us on administrative leave so that they could confiscate our badges. Because once you are put on administrative leave, you don't have any access to your corporate devices. You don't have any access to the building, and they just take your badges. So it was only at that point that they could really charge us with trespassing. Because before then, we were Google employees with active badges who had every right to be in that workplace. It took them until putting us on administrative leave that they could actually get the cops to come in. KABAS: That’s actually helpful context because I was wondering how they said you were on private property if you work there. So that was the way that they did it. IBRAHEEM: It looked like they were genuinely, the entire time, just trying to figure out what to do. I don't think that they had people do this ever—Google employees just refusing to leave as an act of protest. So they were struggling to figure out what the next steps would be to get us to leave. KABAS: When did you find out that you had been fired, and how did you find out? IBRAHEEM: We were arrested around 9:30 PM [Tuesday], then finally got released from the prison at like 2 AM that following day. So we were just there for four hours. And then 7 PM that day—so almost 24 hours after our arrest—I was having dinner with one of the people I was arrested with and they just look up from their phone and say “we’ve been fired.” And then I checked my email and sure enough, we both had received emails just saying “effective immediately termination,” or something along those lines. And then we very quickly found out that more people were fired, and then Google sent out that email saying, “hey guys, we fired 28 of you.” KABAS: If I understand correctly, some of the 28 people fired were not actually involved in the sit in. Is that right? IBRAHEEM: Yeah, this was retaliation, like completely indiscriminate—people who had just walked by just to say hello and maybe talk to us for a little bit. They were fired. People who aren't affiliated with No Tech For Apartheid at all, who just showed up and were interested in what was going on. And then security asked to see their badge and they were among the 28 fired. They had to reach out after the fact to tell us, hey, I was impacted by this. Like we had no reason to suspect that someone who wasn't affiliated with us or wasn't even wearing a shirt or anything related to our sit-in—we had no reason to think that they would be retaliated against. KABAS: That's baffling. Back to the memo sent out to everyone from Chris Rackow, one line really jumped out which is, “If you're one of the few who are tempted to think we're going to overlook conduct that violates our policies, think again.” How did you interpret that? Did you see that as a threat? IBRAHEEM: That's a threat. That is without a doubt a threat. They're just saying, “Hey, don't even dare to think that you can do what these people did.” KABAS: I think people define the effectiveness or the success of a protest in different ways. How would you define whether or not this protest is successful? IBRAHEEM: I believe it is successful right now, like just by the response that we've seen. We did not believe that this one protest was going to get Project Nimbus dropped. It was more that we believed that we wanted to encourage more people to stand up against this contract. We wanted to activate more tech workers, to let them know that there are people who are willing to stand up against their company's complicity in this genocide. So I think from the response we've seen, internally at Google, people supporting us and the people reaching out to join No Tech For Apartheid, I'd say this is a huge success. KABAS: Now that you're not able to protest from the inside because you're not working there anymore, what do you hope that people who remain at Google will do next? IBRAHEEM: I hope they organize—maybe not the same action, but I hope they do their best to make their voices heard, because a lot of these people are just hearing about this protest for the first time. And we've seen so much support for the people who have been arrested, for the people who have been fired, and we've seen a lot of pushback against the email that got sent out. And I think all of these things together are making people realize, what's going on at Google? And I truly believe people are gonna make their voices heard regardless of the threat that was made. KABAS: What was some of the internal pushback about the memo? IBRAHEEM: I mean, very, very reasonably, we were seeing just responses from people saying that like, it seemed threatening. That it seemed a bit much in response to Google employees just sitting-in, in their workspace peacefully, saying, “Hey, drop Project Nimbus or come talk to us about it. Have some sort of conversation with us.” It was a complete overreaction on Google's part to not only fire everyone who was and wasn't involved, but then also threaten everyone else in the company who would dare think to stand up against this. And people are taking notice that it feels like a very fascist environment. Banner in New York office (via No Tech For Apartheid) KABAS: I was looking back, and in the past, Google employees have resigned as a result of company retaliation against their activism and some, like you, have been fired. Why in this specific case do you think they took the more extreme action of going straight to firing you? IBRAHEEM: I think they're scared. I think Google is genuinely afraid of their workers standing up against this project. We know that we [No Tech For Apartheid] are a worker-led organization, even though many times they have tried to paint us as an external group that doesn't represent actual employees. But no, we are Google employees. That's why we all were fired. And Google understands the power that we have, and they are afraid that by more of us speaking up, that they will actually have to do something about it. KABAS: How can other tech workers support your efforts? IBRAHEEM: Share the story. Share as far as it can reach. Tell more people about what we're doing. Speak out against your own company if it is complicit in this genocide. A lot of tech companies are—Amazon is also in this [Project Nimbus] contract with Google and Israel. And we have Intel who is also complicit in this genocide. So if you're at one of these tech companies, stand up against them, and if you're not, share the story. And I think we'll have more ways to support our cause going forward. KABAS: What comes next for you? IBRAHEEM: That's a great question. I think 28 people right now are all trying to figure out what comes next. For me personally, I'm gonna continue to speak up against this as long as I can make my voice heard. Even if I'm not internally at Google, I've been going to Palestinian protests. I will continue to go to more protests. I'll go to protest against Google. I'll go to protest against anyone who's complicit in genocide—that's first and foremost. And then we can figure out about getting a new job later. KABAS: And I'm just curious, do you have a personal connection to Palestine? What got you really clued into this particular issue? I'm Syrian. I'm Muslim. But I'm human, and that should be enough for anyone to have a connection to Palestine. KABAS: What would be your message to the world right now? IBRAHEEM: Stand up and make your voices heard, even if it might be scary. Even if you might face retaliation. Even if you're alone—because people need it right now.

No, Google isn't \"fascist\" for firing you because you barricaded yourself in the CTO's office, intimidated and threatened fellow employees and live streamed the entire charade.

Literally the whole reason that I love democracy is it lets the people set the rules, then gets out of the way and lets people do their thing.

Somewhat true, but not relevant to the point at hand. The historical family was typically run in an autocratic fashion by the elders, without even a vague trace of democracy. For that matter, there are still plenty of places in the world where families are run that way. reply Red_Leaves_Flyy 7 hours agorootparent>The historical family Is this a serious comment or flame bait? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_family reply Turing_Machine 5 hours agorootparentI'm using the OP's term. If you don't like the term, take it up with that person. It's not \"flamebait\" in any case. Instead, perhaps you're disagreeing with my assertion that most families in the past were autocratic, and that in many cultures they still are. A link to a lengthy Wikipedia article does nothing to refute the claim. You're going to have to be more specific. Most historical families in Europe, India, and China were run by the elders on autocratic lines, and those constitute, and pretty much always have constituted, the majority of families on Earth (at least since the population boom brought on by the invention of agriculture). Indeed, in classical Roman civilization, the paterfamilias could kill any junior member of the family at any time, for any reason he chose. Your own article even mentions that.

How to get from our current situation A, to our democratic utopia B is of course not something that we can make justice to in a brief comment, but: Instead of thinking \"hire 2 people\", if you need support of more workers think: \"cooperative\" If instead of support from more workers what you need is capital investment for the public good, think of partial state-ownership in your enterprise (which would be a mean to ensure oversight and making sure that funds are not wasted...

Is that a safe working environment? How do you think an Israeli employee in that same office would have felt on the day of the protests? These protests don't happen in a vacuum.

I can imagine much more concerning shit than people sitting and holding signs. reply ALittleLight 11 hours agorootparentIt's not about feeling like your safety is threatened physically or that you will be hurt or killed. I agree \"threatened\" or \"safety\" language is slightly out of place - but I'm not sure what the right alternative is. The issue is, imagine you disagree with these protesters. Do you feel comfortable saying \"Actually, I support Israel because X, Y, and Z. This isn't really a genocide, blah blah blah.\" I think most people would not feel comfortable disagreeing with a small crowd loudly protesting. Nor should you feel comfortable, in my view, expressing that opinion at work. That opinion might make other people with contrasting opinions feel uncomfortable. It might make them hate you. Work isn't about opining on politics or current affairs, it's about, in Google's case, slightly altering your login form or cancelling products. Employees at work should focus on their jobs, or privately talk with people they are comfortable around - not really a problem if two friends and coworkers have a small political debate over lunch, more of a problem if there is a conversation imposed on unwilling participants. The issue is that some people violate this unspoken agreement and force their political fixations on everyone else. reply deanCommie 9 hours agorootparentOh no, won't someone think of the differing opinion ofpeople who support genocide. Look, I'm sorry that our age is polluted with too much information and people like to play devil's advocate. But history will not be ambiguous on this subject any more than it was on South African apartheid or Nazi Germany. What the political administration of Israel and it's military wing the IDF are doing in Palestine is indefensible. We can split hairs about the legal definition of genocide (because to some unless it reaches the German level of efficiency with literal extermination camps it does not count), but one can support the safety of Jewish people in the Levant without \"supporting Israel\" and arguing about semantic definition while tens of thousands of people die. It's unfortunate that like too many other subjects this is perceived as something that reasonable people can debate about in the west because of how deeply entrenched countries like the US are in supporting Israel at all costs, but it does not change the ethical reality on the ground. reply ALittleLight 9 hours agorootparent> /dev/null reply anal_reactor 11 minutes agorootparentLol \"apply water to the burnt area\" neilk 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, that is perfectly safe.

I feel you’re being deliberately obtuse on this. reply yencabulator 11 hours agorootparentAs far as I read, law enforcement was there just to remove the people from the premises, not to stop violent behavior. You do realize many protests involve just sitting in place until police drags you away, and that that's intentional? reply lp0_on_fire 10 hours agorootparentYou realize that breaking into a private office, being asked, and then told, to leave automatically escalates a situation? Obviously they want to get arrested because they’re out for attention. You realize there are many examples of these sit-ins lately end with protesters gluing themselves to the floor/road or damaging property, maybe toss some paint on priceless art when it happens to a museum? Or relieving themselves in place so that some poor underpaid janitor has to clean up? After the protesters smile for the camera of course. I find that pretty intimidating because if the spoiled rich brats looking for social media points are willing to do that to themselves what else are they willing to do? Is it totally unreasonable to assume one could be stupid and end up hitting someone? In the United State where gun crime is unfortunately high? The likelihood of this particular incident developing into that was probably pretty low but the point is that other people should not have to make that kind of mental calculus at work. They have a right not to be subjected to whatever hot button political cause is in vogue when they’re trying to go to work so they can feed themselves and their family.

Israel has placed civilians in a conflict zone to occupy land. This is not a controversial set of facts and I encourage you to follow it up. Israel is absolutely breaking international law: https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/03/un-human-rig... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement Israel has used civilians for military objectives in occupied land. The civilians comprise part of Israel's hostile, occupying force against the owners of the land, no?

GP, and you in turn, both contend that the employees are not under a democratic regime within the corporation. I understood that point the first time it was made, and I don't disagree with it, so I didn't really need you to explain it again to me. Democracy is a form of political organisation, and since GP brought it up to describe the relationship of the employee to the corporation, I infer that they assimilate the corporation to a polis. So what I am asking is what you would call the type of political organisation that describes the relationship of the employee to this \"polis\" ( the corporation). Feudalism? Monarchy? Theocracy? It's likely none of these three either, but then what describes it best? Edit: For what it's worth, your description of the corporation as a democracy, where the employees provide labour but are not consulted on decisions sounds like Athenian democracy where the employees play the role of the slaves.

Some unions may broaden this to protect the interests of the industry at large, but even that is because it’s considered related to the direct interests of the members.

This is not happening in a vacuum. It is ALSO unfortunately true that whenever the issue of Palestinian statehood becomes magnified some activists use this as an excuse to promote all sorts of classic anti-Jewish conspiracy theorists and start raging about Jewish people indiscriminately, not just the Apartheid system. (Much in the same way that some BLM protestors take things too far and start accusing all white people indiscriminately of racism). But it is happening. Since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_keffiyeh is inherently associated with Yasser Arafat, many uneducated people innocently incorrectly assume that it is inherently a piece of terrorist paraphernalia, and as a result feel unsafe just from it's mere presence at peaceful demonstrations. Likewise, \"from the river to the sea\" and chants like it also imply a jewish genocide for them, and make them feel unsafe. I personally believe that particular chant is more harmful than helpful, and I likewise cringe at people wearing keffiyeh's as a means of solidarity. I don't care about what people THINK it means, it is perceived by those whose opinions they must change the most (unengaged moderates) as a symbol of terrorism for justifiable reasons. (Much like the Nazi Swastika's original hindu origins don't matter anymore in any context outside of India, sorry) So. It's complex. It's nuanced. I don't know what happened. But I wouldn't assume that just because someone \"felt threatened\" by this protest that the protestors actually did anything indefensible. Others have already touched upon the point that \"vandalism\" can be defined however any party wishes it to be. My 4 year old drawing in chalk on a sidewalk could be considered vandalism, if someone wanted to. In Google's case, using scotch tape to attach a sign to a door and lightly scuffing some of the paint as a result, could be considered \"vandalism\" for the purpose of an HR-justifiable firing. This is no different than \"assault\" legally being any physical contact. Tapping someone on the shoulder could be \"assault\" if it's deemed aggressive and unwanted.

The belief that Israel should remain, legally, a Jewish supremacist state, where only Jewish sovereignty is recognized. I disagree strongly with both of these notions. reply deanCommie 5 hours agorootparentprevTo me, Zionism is more than just the belief that Jewish people are entitled to a state of their own in the Levant. Because if at this point you say that you DON'T believe that you are also saying that you don't care about what happens to the millions of them that live there now, or believe that that the displaced Palestinians themselves are entitled to some form of restitution against their oppressors. Unfortunately we have to deal with the reality on the ground and the reality of Jewish people in the UN partition plan. Reparations must be made and expansion must be rolled back (all settlers out of west bank) but at the end of the day any future must involve either A) a state for Jewish people and a state for Palestinian people or B) A completely united state with full equality for all people. To me Zionism is the belief that the Jewish people have an inherent RIGHT to an ethnic-orientated state in the Levant based on historical (biblical) tradition. There are many ethnic groups in the world without a homeland, and the crimes against humanity against Jews in WW2 did not necessitate such a state there, if it involved displacing others, which it did. So I'm Anti-Zionist in the sense that I am against religion-based geopolicy, I am against any inherent \"greater\" reason for a Jewish state. I am a humanist who believes in the right for safety and prosperity for Jewish and Palestenian people. I am not interested in any solutions where either does not grant the other's humanity or right to safety and prosperity. Beyond that they need to AGGRESSIVELY self-police one another.

My opinion (I can’t come up with anything else that matches the facts): The military leadership on both sides of this conflict should be tried and convicted for war crimes, including genocide. The conflict is happening because the military wings of both governments are trying to consolidate power and secure funding/resources. The Israeli and Palestinian civilians (and Israeli conscripts — they still have a draft) are the victims here.

Those who flagged it aren't in that category. reply elAhmo 19 hours agoparentprevPurpose of flagging it to not have a discussion about this as it sheds a light about what is happening. reply ryandrake 18 hours agorootparentIf you browse HN's recent history, you'll find that nearly every single \"Google/Israel\" related article that gained any traction has gotten flagged by readers. People are clearly abusing \"flag\" as a mega-downvote to bury discussions they don't want to see happening. Pretty sad. I don't have a strong opinion on this topic, but I don't think this is appropriate behavior here. HN's \"flamewar detector\" should be enough to quickly move these stories off the front page if they get too hot. Why also flag? reply thegrim33 15 hours agorootparentNo, I flag them because, like this thread, 99% of comments are just political/social warfare and has nothing to do with technology. It's just an extension of the culture war. You can go on Reddit or Facebook or basically anywhere else on the internet to do your cultural warfare. Can we have a single place left where we don't fall into that pit? reply ambrozk 4 hours agorootparentOf course the protest is about technology -- it's about the provision of technology to governments who use that technology for war. Why wouldn't you expect the employees of these companies have a position on that? Like a lot of people here, I have family who died in the Holocaust. It is highly likely that the camps they moved through were using tech supplied by IBM. Would it have been \"culture warring\" for tech employees circa 1938, to publicize the human rights abuses being enabled by their companies? Because that's what the people who support these protesters think is going on here. reply dunekid 14 hours agorootparentprevHave you missed the memo that HN discussion need not be strictly about technology.

You see this in the \"free speech zones\" and other nonsense. But it's also just simply obvious and freely admitted. They were protesting inside Google buildings, which gives lee-way for their arrest and firing. Both sides are calculating that arrest and firing helps their cause. reply paxys 18 hours agorootparentThere are political protests that happen in a free democratic society and protests that happen in a multi-trillion dollar capitalist corporation. I have no idea why people think they should or will be treated the same. The Google constitution does not give employees the right to free speech or the right to stage public protests. reply ambrozk 4 hours agorootparentThis is textbook civil disobedience. They believed they could not quietly aid an ongoing injustice, so they loudly protested in the full knowledge they would be punished. This is how protest is supposed to work. reply rstat1 16 hours agorootparentprevNo but the US one does, and its the only one that matters in this particular case. reply scheme271 12 hours agorootparentThe US constitution applies to the US government. For a while, there were questions as to which parts and how much of it applied to state governments. The constitution doesn't really apply to private individuals and organizations, which is why a company can do things like ban neo-nazis from their platforms. reply coredog64 10 hours agorootparentWhile it’s technically correct that the First Amendment only applies to the US government, it is also true that Americans are (or were) understood to have broad free speech rights that included all facets of life. Were that not the case, the Hollywood blacklisting of known or suspected Communists would be a nothing-burger and not a cause célèbre. reply otterley 7 hours agorootparentNobody at the time called Hollywood blacklisting a First Amendment violation. In fact, the First Amendment offered pretty weak protections for content once deemed pretty subversive, yet considered banal today, until the 1969 Brandenberg Supreme Court decision. For example, in the 1920s you could be criminally prosecuted for openly sympathizing with the Communist party and that was deemed just fine. See Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927). It shouldn’t be lost on anyone knowledgeable of legal history that every conservative who relies on modern “free speech” principles to insulate themselves from liability for disseminating bullshit to achieve their political gains has a “liberal activist court” to thank for the privilege. reply cbHXBY1D 18 hours agoparentprevMaybe because the article is an interview with someone at the NYC sit-in? reply doctaj 8 hours agoparentprevPeople wouldn’t usually get fired for hanging out in someone’s office.

I'm saying that statements of fact require support. reply mandmandam 16 hours agorootparentOk, but why question only the \"statement of fact\" made in response to the \"statement of fact\" that \"they locked themselves in the CTO's office and this is why they were fired?\" Why value a random HN stranger's account over the account of an employee who sacrificed a lucrative career to bring attention to this? Is it perhaps because you ideologically agree with one \"statement of fact\" over the other? Or is it more self interested? reply Vegenoid 12 hours agorootparentThis person did not bring up the lack of proof for the claim unprompted, they responded to somebody asking about the truth of the statement: > So is this a lie?

On a personal level, I do not believe that the magnitude of a person's sacrifice empowers their beliefs with any particular level of truth, accuracy, or moral imperative. The magnitude of a person's sacrifice is, in my mind, a statement only and strictly on the depths of their conviction and willingness to sacrifice. History is replete with examples of people who have sacrificed much for reasons good, bad, or just plain weird to our eyes. reply paxys 14 hours agorootparentprevDo you have any evidence that Google's version is incorrect or incomplete?

    "title": "Valkey Gaining Momentum Over Redis",
    "originLink": "https://devops.com/valkey-is-rapidly-overtaking-redis/",
    "originBody": "Valkey is Rapidly Overtaking Redis By: Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols on April 19, 2024 In March, Redis announced that it was dumping the open source BSD 3-clause license for its Redis in-memory key-value database, instead adopting a “source-available” Redis Source Available License (RSALv2) and Server Side Public License (SSPLv1). That made both developers and users unhappy. So as open source people do, members of the community forked the code into Valkey with the support of The Linux Foundation. This move has proved much more popular than expected. Madelyn Olson, an Amazon Web Services (AWS) software engineer and a Valkey maintainer, announced at the Open Source Summit in Seattle the availability of the first release, Valkey 7.2.5 GA. This release is based on the last open source version of Redis, 7.2.4. That’s good news, but it’s not big news. That’s what we expect from forks. Rather, the important news is the immediate support for Valkey. AWS, Ericsson, Google Cloud, Oracle and Verizon had all said they were supporting the fork. Now Alibaba Cloud, Aiven, Heroku and Percona are backing Valkey as well. I’ve seen many forks take off and overcome their parent projects – LibreOffice over OpenOffice comes to mind — but I’ve never seen one where so many Fortune 500 businesses spun on their heels to drop one project for another. Olson said in her keynote speech, “These companies are planning to continue or even increase their contributions. Their support is needed for the long-term health and viability of the project. The community is thankful for their support, which will help keep the project open and keep our developers moving at the pace that our users demand.” The Valkey fork’s maintainers have the technical chops needed to fulfill those business needs. As Olson pointed out, its technical leadership committee has 26 years of experience and over 1,000 commits to the open source project. Indeed, Tencent’s Binbin Zhu, a committee member, alone contributed almost a quarter of the open source Redis commits. This response is not what Redis had in mind. At the time of the fork, Redis CEO Rowan Trollope didn’t seem too worried. “The major cloud service providers have all benefited commercially from the Redis open source project, so it’s not surprising that they are launching a fork within a foundation,” he wrote. And he added, “Innovation has been and always will be the differentiating factor between the success of Redis and any alternative solution.” With so many top maintainers now at Valkey, that assertion may be hard to pull off. As Heroku’s CTO Gail Frederick said during the conference, “With this group of experienced contributors and broad industry backing, Valkey is continuing the open source model that’s been transformative for developers everywhere.” So many top Redis (the software) customers shifting to Valkey presents Redis (the company) with serious challenges. After all, Redis was the most popular database on AWS and by DB-Engine’s latest count, it’s the most popular key-value DBMS. It appears that many of those customers are now on their way to Valkey. Kyle Davis, an AWS senior developer advocate and former Redis employee, said, “AWS is committed to supporting open source Valkey for the long term. We are adding Valkey support to our ElastiCache and MemoryDB managed database services, which are built on open source Redis.” Karan Singh, Oracle’s Director of Data and AI Product Management, wrote that “Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Cache will continue supporting its current Redis 7.0-based service because the license changes don’t impact it.” However, Oracle is dropping the name Redis from its offering and is “working on integrating Valkey support into the OCI Cache service to ensure our unique in-memory database offerings on OCI continue to benefit from open source advancements, enhancing value for our customers.” Empirical data suggests users are also moving away from Redis. Peter Zaitsev, Percona CEO, noted that DB-Engine is already showing a drop of interest in Redis. Redis’s move attracted a lot of snarkiness. For example, Corey Quinn, chief cloud economist at The Duckbill Group, an AWS analyst firm, tweeted, “Good morning to everyone except the thieves at Redis. You didn’t build it; you stole it from the community. If you want it from the ones who built it, it’s called Valkey.” What we’re seeing here is not open source fans copping an attitude. It’s companies and developers alike making a major move away from Redis.

Full disclosure: This is my tool reply devsda 6 hours agoparentprev> Why shouldn't people support the fork? That's a valid question and to be fair to Redis, we should also ask ourselves what are the incentives for Redis (or any other commercial oss) to continue development of truly free and open-source Redis? If the answer is opensource ideals, it is not an honest or realistic answer. If the answer is they can always get paid through hosted offerings and product support, Redis folks are saying that's not a sustainable option because of cloud providers. Redis users fall into broad categories of individual developers, startups, medium level companies and enterprise scale companies. Individual users are unlikely to pay. Enterprise customers are big enough to have dedicated resources for support. It leaves startups and medium level companies. These users are leaving on-premise and moving to cloud providers and if there's a frictionless hosted solution by the provider itself they are likely to prefer that over paying Redis. There are always exceptions but I don't think this is far from reality. If the quip is, Redis should offer a better product, they cannot! Not when competing with cloud provider's own offerings. They will be always be at a disadvantage in terms of total cost(for marketplace products) and resources spent for development of the core product itself. I believe their license changes is about them trying to reduce the impact of cloud offerings. I don't know if there is a better approach for Redis and the community but as users of their product we are also responsible to provide a sustainable path for development and come up with a solution for this common problem. Otherwise, Redis will not be the only product to take this direction.

Why can’t Valkey be another one? reply xmprt 11 hours agoprevThe biggest mistake Redis Labs made was doing a rebrand at the exact same time as a license change. Usually you want rebrands to be loud and well known and license changes to be silent and ignored until it's too late and people have adopted the new license. In this case, they loudly announced that they're making an unpopular change and it gave everyone the will to switch. reply ok_dad 11 hours agoparentI’m amazed that they thought that they could do this and get away with it. Redis is almost a foundational tool for modern caching architectures. Every company I’ve ever worked at used redis like candy to cache stuff that wasn’t important enough for the reliable but expensive and slow data stores. Additionally, the main features 99% of people want and need have been in redis for a decade. Even a fork that only fixed security bugs will have done better than Redis Labs after this debacle. It’s like if the author of nano, the text editor, would try this license change. I suspect this will be much like the {open/libre}office changeover. Maybe soon ‘apt get redis’ and others will be aliased to Valkey. reply crabmusket 11 hours agorootparent> Even a fork that only fixed security bugs will have done better than Redis Labs after this debacle This describes Redict, not Valkey. I think it's actually great we have two forks, so they can focus on different things. reply willsmith72 9 hours agorootparentprevI'm curious about the impact of the licence change on the average company. Were you self-hosting redis in all your companies, or how were you using it? reply ok_dad 8 hours agorootparentI think that the uproar about license changes are less about actual license impact and more about the impact to the community and social framework that Redis has fostered as a project previously. People are switching because at this point they think they can’t trust Redis Labs not to do more dumb stuff later. Combine that with my previous assertion that redis is very important software at most companies, and the calculus leans in favor of using the fork because any further major license changes might necessitate it anyways, and it’s easier to do now than under the gun. It’s important to not do stuff that loses trust when you’re a company founded on a community. reply Spivak 5 hours agorootparentYeah, I'm willing to trust the Linux Foundation won't pull a stunt like this but I have zero faith that in 5 years there won't be another announcement that \" are no longer allowed to use it without paying.\" reply sdesol 6 hours agoparentprev> The biggest mistake Redis Labs made was doing a rebrand at the exact same time as a license change. I honestly don't think that was the issue. The issue, unlike Elastic vs Amazon is, this change affects a lot of big players like Google, Amazon, and Oracle. reply NewJazz 5 hours agorootparentElastic change affected amazon so much that they forked. I think the real difference is that Redis Labs never hired the majority of contributors. reply shepardrtc 10 hours agoprevSaw a presentation by them at this week's Open Source Summit. Seems like a lot of the major contributors to Redis have moved over to this project. And it seems like AWS is a major supporter of it. I suspect their Elasticache Redis will soon be Elasticache Valkey. reply andix 9 hours agoparentI would personally never contribute to a project with non-free license without getting paid. It's basically working for a company without pay. reply madeofpalk 8 hours agorootparentI would never contribute to commercially backed, freely licensed project unless I was being paid. Saying this as a developer who is paid for exactly that, not it any inside knowledge that points to ulterior motives, but just the idea of giving a company free labour is unsettling. reply sdesol 6 hours agorootparent> I would never contribute to commercially backed, freely licensed project unless I was being paid. Based on what I've seen, a lot of people contribute to VC/commercially backed projects for resume/career growth reasons. reply cratermoon 6 hours agorootparentIt's fair to say that in the early days of the FOSS movement, people were contributing for prestige and recognition. The commercialization into \"Open Source\" meant that work was appropriated for profit by organizations that weren't interested in either the \"free as in beer\" or \"free as in freedom\" aspects. Naturally people followed their mercenary lead and started to work on them for the financial benefits. reply anacrolix 7 hours agorootparentprevLike the Go project? reply objektif 8 hours agorootparentprevIt is almost same as transferring your hard earned money to the founders of the company. Of course it is unsettling. reply paxys 9 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is that an open source project you contribute to can become non-free from under you at any point. This pattern is becoming more and more common now. reply andix 9 hours agorootparentThis is only half true in my opinion. Only future versions will be non-free, all the contributions before the license change stay free and can be forked. Any project with a permissive license (BSD/MIT) can always be made into a commercial product. I could fork Valkey any minute, change the name and start selling it. reply wmf 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are ways to prevent that which in retrospect we should have paid more attention to. For example, (L)GPL with no CLA cannot be changed later. reply btilly 9 hours agorootparentIn retrospect, Redis Labs is about to learn a lesson that many have learned before. Community willingness to maintain popular software under the old license means that attempting to make free non-free will result in a fork taking over. As a prior example look at what happened a few years back when Oracle tried to make Hudson non-free. Now nobody has heard of Hudson, but everybody uses Jenkins. Which name was chosen for the sheer mockery value and reference to the then infamous https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4. There are people who think we need the legal protection of the GPL. But there are others who trust in community pressures to make the right thing happen. reply Macha 8 hours agorootparentWas Jenkins a Leeroy Jenkins reference? Seemed to be just continuing the butler theme from Hudson. reply andix 8 hours agorootparentprevA lot of younger folks probably never heard of XFree86 or OpenOffice.org. In a few years Terraform and now Redis might end up just like them. reply andix 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's the decade old philosophical fight about what to consider free software. GPL/GNU vs BSD. I think both opinions are fine, if you don't want your contributions to end up in a commercial product, you can't contribute to a project with BSD/MIT license. On the other hand most companies prefer to support projects with a permissive license over projects with copyleft (GPL). For many projects (except the big ones like GNU/Linux) copyleft seems to be more of a burden. reply skybrian 8 hours agorootparentprevantirez wanted to allow it, not prevent it: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39863371 reply paxys 11 hours agoprevGood. I hope Redis Labs dies a slow death for stealing the project from the community. reply kawsper 11 hours agoparentThere's something wrong at Redislabs, it took them over a year to get RESP3 rolled out into their hosted service, you'd expect a rollout of that to be a bit quicker when they're the owner of Redis. It affected us when upgrading Sidekiq to version 7, which dropped support for older Redis, and their Envoy proxy setup didn't support HELLO and RESP3: https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/issues/5594 reply mperham 10 hours agorootparentI was honestly shocked by this too, I never intended Sidekiq users to left in a lurch like this. It took them over three years from the RESP3 release before their service supported it. I figured any good SaaS should be dogfooding their own releases, but I guess not! reply saghm 9 hours agorootparentHaving not heard of any of this before now, I'm struggling to wrap my head around why this would be evidence that they're not good stewards of Redis-the-project (as opposed to their Redis service). If they had delayed the general release until their cloud could support it or tried to expedite their cloud release by moving resources over to the cloud services, I feel like that would be much more worrisome in terms of their stewardship of the project as a whole. If anything, it sounds like they basically chose to prioritize Redis in general over their own offering, which is exactly what I'd expect people in the community to want. reply pm90 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is a very common but wrong assumption. The OSS and Cloud divisions of most companies are very different beasts. The engineers that staff them are different, and their focus is different. This has often lead to issues where the company that creates the project doesn’t always have the capability to support it at scale. TBH, while I don’t support that kind of behavior, the cloud providers probably provide the best SaaS support for most OSS projects, just because of the operational capabilities they have created. reply skybrian 7 hours agoparentprevNothing was stolen. The license allows commercial forks. Also, nothing of value was lost. The new forks have all the source code. reply KronisLV 55 minutes agorootparent> Also, nothing of value was lost.

You may as well just start mentally teaching yourself to alias redis to valkey. reply tredre3 9 hours agorootparentThose numbers mean nothing because obviously a fork in its inception will have a burst of activity. Half of those changes are probably just renaming redis => valkey, too. Let's check the numbers in 6 months or a year for a truly meaningful figure about the health of each project. reply objektif 8 hours agorootparentBased on your logic “activity” may never be a good metric for usage. reply tredre3 7 hours agorootparentI don't know what gave you that idea? I'm fine with using the activity comparison to declare a winner. But valkey was created a few weeks ago, obviously it's going to have a burst of activity. However most forks die off rather quickly after the initial burst of enthusiasm. That one might be different, because it has corporate sponsors. So, in 6 months, do the exact same comparison (recent activity, # of recent contributors) and it'll be good enough for me. reply freeAgent 8 hours agorootparentprevAnd that’s also true insofar as it’ll never be a perfect measure and in some cases (such as comparing a mature project to a brand new fork), it’s a bad measure. reply wmf 9 hours agorootparentprevHow are we supposed to interpret these numbers?

I have the feeling that CEOs are mostly stupid people. reply renewiltord 9 hours agoprevIt's too dangerous to build a company around open source. You're trapped between AWS eating you or having to relicense and AWS eating you. Source-available from the beginning protects you from this. The problem with OSS stuff is that people are generally price-sensitive and you can't beat the platforms for this since they get the R&D for free. It's sort of how I don't hire junior people. When others have trained them up, I can just hire them for more. The other guys have to pay to train them so they hope to get some reward for that, but switching costs are low. I can just take pre-trained guys. And just like the pre-trained guys in this scenario, AWS can always offer a better deal. You need to moat your stuff in some way. Elastic License is ideal if you want to build a company around this. If you just want to make things for the good of mankind or whatever, you can use BSD/GPL/MIT/whatever, but you're doomed if you want to build a company around those licenses. Elastic made it by being quick to the jump. Others have followed. The only really successful model that's different has got to be Kong and RHEL and they've both been around a while. Kong's adoption is troubled because once you get successful, using their OSS thing is better than the enterprise because their pricing tiers go up. But they seem to have good enterprise sales team. Don't know about RHEL. But if I were starting a company around this stuff, I'd be very careful about having core tech be true OSS. Source-available yeah, but true OSS is too risky. reply kstrauser 7 hours agoparentAll well and good, except a lot of us here go out of our way not to build software on top of proprietary software.

The one thing I take as a bit of a potential bitter irony is that if Redis had had the level of support & contributions ValKey has, Redis Labs might have been able to keep doing what they were doing?

Interestingly there must have been a lot of people that wanted to get a transaction in the halving block, including fees and subsidy it resulted in a total reward of over 40 BTC for the pool that mined the block, ViaBTC. reply foota 9 hours agoparentWas the multiplier high enough for this block that it would have made sense to rent GPUs to mine it? reply px43 9 hours agorootparentNo, GPUs are literally millions of times less power performant than equivalent ASICs for sha256 mining. In the GPU days, mining was talked about in terms of megahashes per second, and ASIC miners these days are talked about in terms of terrahashes per second. reply ProllyInfamous 7 hours agorootparent>In the GPU days... Back in my earliest days, a CPU could mine bitcoin (it was just a check/enable box in the preferences). HODL, erryday, frens. reply bavell 6 hours agorootparentI remember when the first GPU kernels came out... exciting times! reply cdchn 7 hours agorootparentprevUnrealized gains are unrealized. reply ProllyInfamous 6 hours agorootparentAmen... I only vaguely recall something about a boating accident. reply px43 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah I was mining hundreds of BTC per day on an Athlon 2200. That was the low kilohash era. reply Heliodex 9 hours agorootparentprevI don't think so, partly because the total reward + fees was only 5-6x that of a typical block and partly because almost all blocks are now mined by pools that share block rewards among their members usually based on hash rate, so one would have to be in the pool that mined the block as well. Also the fact that GPUs are less efficient than using specific mining hardware/ASICs for most Proof of Work cryptocurrencies. reply sanswork 9 hours agorootparentprevNo reply fsckboy 8 hours agorootparentprevif it made sense to rent them on the chance of getting the reward, who who had them would rent them to you rather than pursuing the reward themselves? reply sanswork 8 hours agorootparentEven if it did make more sense in straight EV terms no one is running that calculation of you're in three business of renting GPUs you'd rent them out either way unless it was a really high probability of success. reply fsckboy 2 hours agorootparentand the high probability of success is exactly the case we are talking about. reply munchler 9 hours agoprevAny interest I might have in this is tempered by the fact that Bitcoin mining accounts for about 0.2% of global carbon emissions - roughly the same as the country of Greece. As long as Bitcoin is based on a proof-of-work process, I think the world would be better off without it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_bitco... reply Heliodex 9 hours agoparentI do believe there are many better proof systems available at the moment, and I thought its emissions would be higher than 0.2%. Though if fossil fuels account for the majority of global carbon emissions, and banks providing the majority of fossil fuel investments, banks should surely account for a much larger portion of global emissions. There is an argument to be made that Bitcoin could end up producing more carbon emissions if it already produces this much with a much lower transaction capacity than most banking systems. However, systems like the Lightning Networkbuild on top of Bitcoin by settling transactions before they ever reach the blockchain, slashing fees and bundling possibly hundreds or thousands of transactions into one, so the number of payments that actually occur could be much greater than it seems. reply kinakomochidayo 2 hours agorootparentLightning Network design is horrible, and it's literally impossible to onboard millions of users without increasing the L1 blocksize to an absurd amount. The world will likely move onto using rollups on other chains like Ethereum instead, which scale better, and pays gas to validators to get included into the blocks. Seems like the Bitcoin community is looking into rollups on Bitcoin, but it'll be impossible to get trustless Bitcoin on them, even with BitVM, without a hardfork. reply lowkey 7 hours agorootparentprevIgnoring banks for a moment, consider the US military which some claim protects the value of the dollar. According to The Atlantic, the US military alone counts for 5.5% of global carbon emissions. https://archive.is/DVWZs reply cdchn 7 hours agorootparentWhats the total market cap of the economic value protected by the US military? reply emporas 9 hours agoparentprevComputer chips do not need to use energy useful to humans, BTC and also deep learning algos just to name a few. Sam Altman should go to Saudis and plug GPUs directly as petroleum gets out of the ground, and then transfer the trained bits to any country he likes. Blockchain mining was a favorite for Icelanders who have in excess geothermal energy. Energy is expensive or not cheap, only on places in the world in which it is not abundant. Factories of robots (see Jeff Bezos), or computers mining numbers, or computers training statistics can be located anywhere we like.

What fraction of those are gaming PCs? Gaming laptops? Laptops with integrated graphics that really aren't meant for gaming? Let's say that your typical PC gamer uses 300W when playing video games. That's probably on the low end for a gaming PC, but an overestimate for any laptop. 300W * 24 * 365 * 60 million is about 160 billion kWh. That translates to, um, 33000 tons of CO2? So like 3 orders of magnitude smaller? I'm not even going to bother with the mobile game population because the power draw on those is like single-digit watts so even if there are 100x more players, the numbers are around the same order of magnitude.

If the currency WERE the commodity, and assuming a deflationary environment, working people would find they would have a decreasing share of the currency to begin with. In other words, the reason working people currently have enough money to buy BTC as an investment, is that they are using a non-deflationary currency. Also note that buying stocks is only marginally more difficult than opening a bank account, and investing in major index funds via ETFs is almost as good as a term deposit (with minimal long term risk of realising a loss UNLESS you are forced to access the money at some time relatively soon after purchasing). After you have created the account, buying more is easier than using a BTC ATM.

Imagine you take out a loan to buy a car. Tomorrow, hyperinflation happens and the currency has lost 99% of its value. You can now pay off your car with a can of beans.

There's I think supposed to only ever be 21 million bitcoin. Bitcoin rewards for mining halve every ~4 years. Eventually they will stop; there will be no new bitcoin. People will also lose bitcoin; this already happens. Famously, no one knows where ~1m bitcoin supposedly mined by Satoshi are, they are assumed to be permanently out of circulation. So not only is there a cap on maximum bitcoin, and over time less new bitcoin will be injected into circulation, existing bitcoin will also be removed from circulation over time. This presents a strong incentive to hold bitcoin instead of spending it, since scarce assets become more valuable with increased scarcity. If a bitcoin is likely to be worth more tomorrow than it is today, you're less likely to spend it. Which has the compound effect of reducing bitcoin in circulation further. This is why people say it's deflationary. reply hugs 9 hours agoparentprevSpending tiny amounts using Bitcoin's Lightning Network for digital (SaaS) services is something I'm exploring.

When something costs only a few cents (sats in Bitcoin-speak), the variability of the full price of one Bitcoin is minimal.

The purchasing power of a currency issued by a soevereign can only go to zero as a result of the collapse of sovereignty (ie. no more guns, or being outgunned).

That's clearly not the case. reply jpcfl 8 hours agorootparentIf I spend $2M to mine $2M of gold, and the value of that gold increases by 2x over the next 10 years, then I think I could stay in business. That would actually be a pretty solid business. The value of BTC has increased nearly ~200x in the last 10 years. I don't anticipate it will do this again, but I'm sure some of these miners think it will continue to grow at some rate (plus, they have already capitalized on the last 10yrs of growth). reply quesera 8 hours agorootparentThat doesn't make sense. If miners are break-even only after pricing in future valuation movement, then they would just buy BTC at SPOT. No need for all the capex, opex, uncertainty of hashing success, and time-limited acquisition of doing the work of mining. reply jpcfl 7 hours agorootparentThat wasn't my point. My point was that they could stay in business. My original point was that it was in the ballpark of $2M. Could be more, could be less, all depending on a number of variables--I believe one of those variable just doubled. I'm not sure what the cost is now, but back in 2012-ish when I briefly looked into mining, it cost about $1 in energy to mine $1 worth of BTC. I used your logic and decided it didn't make sense to invest in mining, so I didn't. I wish I had, or at least purchased some BTC, but I was a broke college student just looking to capitalize on the hardware I already owned, and I didn't really know a thing about investing (other than investing in a 6 pack of beer to meet girls at parties--my ROI was not great, BTW, so I don't recommend this strategy). reply quesera 7 hours agorootparentI sympathize! I considered running a miner in 2012, with the positive side effect of heating my office. Decided I didn't want to listen to the fan noise for negligible returns. > it cost about $1 in energy to mine $1 worth of BTC This is the crux of it (we may be saying the same thing!). There is no 1:1 relationship between mining cost and reward on a single block. If there was, no one would do it, because they do not win every block. And all blocks you compete on cost the same, win or lose, but of course the blocks you don't win, pay zero. There's a (very) roughly 1:1 relationship between a miner's overall cost and reward, averaged over many blocks. If reward increases (BTC price spikes), more competition comes online and your win frequency drops. So if the question is \"how much energy (cost) did it take to mine this specific $2MM block\", the answer is closer to \"The average block reward divided by the winning miner's win frequency\", which is e.g. 5% for one of the bigger miners (I did not check this block or this miner). This was a high reward block, so the real miner cost might have been more like $50K. Less for energy alone. But it's like the guy who buys a $10 lottery ticket every day. He needs to win a few hundred dollars per month to maintain the habit (gambling addiction notwithstanding!). Today he got lucky and won $700 on the $10 ticket. reply Ukv 6 hours agorootparentprev> every miner would have to win every block to stay in business To my understanding that'd be true if the energy cost was $2M per miner, but I think jpcfl was suggesting $2M total. i.e. that an individual miner would spend $100 on energy for a $100 expected return, which may be a 10% chance at $1000 or a 100% chance at $100. Could adjust $2M up slightly for whatever portion was done by crypto-mining malware or dabblers with higher expected energy costs than return, and down for the portion done by professional miners who will be expecting a slightly positive return even after factoring in other costs. reply latchkey 6 hours agorootparentprevSorry, that isn't how proof of work mining works. The key point to understand is the effect of difficulty on mining. reply vitiral 9 hours agorootparentprevWell, 2M of energy + opex at least reply whimsicalism 7 hours agorootparentprevwrong reply 1123581321 7 hours agoparentprevThe average electricity used per block mined is around 3 Gwh which costs in the $200-400k ballpark collectively (I know they seek cheaper electricity, but I'm unsure how cheap or what discounts they get.) (Approximated by Bitcoin's reported .5% share of global electricity consumption, which is around 25k Twh. A block is mined every ten minutes. Hopefully I didn't make any order-of-magnitude errors!) ViaBTC, the winning pool, has about 13% of the global hashing power so perhaps spent $40k plus their other expenses. reply RivieraKid 9 hours agoprevGiven some weak assumptions, it can be proven that Bitcoin can't beat the performance of S&P 500 in a long enough time horizon. The gist of it is this: Bitcoin can't perpetually grow faster than world wealth. If we assume, say, 3% inflation-adjusted growth in world wealth, it means that Bitcoin cannot perpetually make more than 3% annually. Stocks, bonds, real-estate don't have this constraint because they pay cash to investors. At some point in the future, Bitcoin will be down over the last decade while S&P 500 will be up significantly. Bitcoin holders will start to think - wait, why am I holding Bitcoin instead of S&P 500?

My estimate is that peak Bitcoin is anywhere between the current 0.3% and 1.5% (implied price $325k).

My government, as a NATO member, supported multiple US-led operations, targeting nations not related with NATO interests (such as eg. Iraq). Was I in agreement? No. Am I responsible for the actions of my government? Obviously. Living in a democracy is not cherry-picking what you want; is understanding that a majority may have a different opinion than you, and may even listen to you; Responsibility is shared in both the good parts and the bad parts. I understand this may be a shock to a US citizen, as it would be for me if I ever lived in a country where truth, facts and people interests matter little to nothing.

The rest of the crypto industry has moved on. It simply took to long for bitcoin to be used for anything outside of speculation.

Stuff like Lightning is cute on paper, but it really only stands to make you realize how horribly doomed the main currency is conceptually. L2 chains are where I stopped being interested in crypto. It's like reading the plaque of Ozymandias and thinking to yourself \"Ah, the desert.

This strikes me as a defective comparison: are there people who are trying to receive email spam, but are unable to do so due to international borders? The health of the internet in resisting censorship is well-documented, as you point out - and it has ramifications both desirable and otherwise. The innovation of blockchain tech is that it adds a mechanism for transmitting value in this censorship-resistant environment. reply shuckles 6 hours agorootparentPeople circumvent currency controls and financial regulation over the internet with gift cards, airline miles, WoW gold farms, and more. Bitcoin's notable quality is not technology; it's the social psychology which drew enough speculation that it covered for laundering black market financial transactions at unprecedented scale. Some of that illegal volume might be sympathetic oppressed citizens; my guess is the vast majority is old fashioned crime and terrorism. Notably, there is nothing technically notable about Bitcoin's censorship resistance. It's no more resistant than the internet itself. What's notable is the scale and efficiency at which it attracts clean money to wash dirty money, and none of that is about Proof of Work or Merkle DAGs. The argument I was responding to falls apart when you notice that The Pirate Bay, Libgen, and Scihub are all extremely resilient despite lacking all the Game Theory gobbledygook which BTC adds. reply nailer 7 hours agorootparentprevOddly enough if email had adopted proof of work (spam was the original incentive for PoW, originally called ‘hashcash’) spam would be less of a problem reply phantomathkg 8 hours agoparentprev> Nobody can stop it.

Simple answer: yes, they can. For example a state actor or a crazy billionare could spend enough money to launch a 51% attack. Indeed the theoretical attack requires only around 20% of mining power. Also, the next generation of people could choose another blockchain, Bitcoin turns irrelevant because another blockchain surpasses it in the audience. reply yownie 7 hours agorootparentIt would now requires more like a trillion and they would also have to KEEP spending or everyone could just switch chains at point. reply zooq_ai 7 hours agorootparentDelusional, The cost of energy to carry out 51% attack is a few millions / minute. reply cdchn 7 hours agorootparentDelusional is also thinking \"oh they'd just hard fork and roll back the transactions.\" And then they just keep doing it over and over again. reply bufferoverflow 7 hours agorootparentprevEven if you had the money, there's not enough hardware for sale to get 20% of mining power.

If BTC's marketcap is $1T and it'll only take $5B for a 51% attack, there can be some arbitrage opportunity for a large hedge fund determined enough. The only thing preventing this is the attacker must execute this flawlessly including attacking all the forks that may happen. reply ramchip 7 hours agorootparentThere's also a legal risk for private entities, as the conviction of Avraham Eisenberg showed recently, and I think a strong possibility that a successful attack would crash the valuation of BTC and make it impossible to recoup costs. reply jbverschoor 7 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not what a 51% attack can do. It doesn’t allow you to “steal” money reply monero-xmr 7 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is the government has to acquire the hardware.

I fully understand what \"the havening\" is, and this statement is grossly misleading. Yes, the mining rewards for each block were cut in half. That does not mean \"miners have just adopted a 50% pay cut for themselves\". A lower block reward means some combination of (a) transaction fees will go up, (b) mining competition goes down because it doesn't make as much sense to spend electricity on a smaller reward and (c) the overall deflationary economics built into Bitcoin mean while the rewards are nominally less, they are worth more. reply bytearray 7 hours agoparentprevWhat happens when the last coin is mined and there's no incentive for people to run the network of computers that validates transactions? It seems like at that point the value would go to zero. reply foldor 7 hours agorootparentMiners would still collect transaction fees. reply spenvo 7 hours agorootparentThis is the inevitable outcome. And yet it is (extremely) improbable that individuals will pay many many billions of dollars/year to move money around (which is what it takes to secure the network). The only way the network's security does not collapse is if bitcoin's value goes up faster than it declines over time (50% every four years (the halving)). No one does the basic napkin math on this and it drives me nuts. Unless the code changes, Bitcoin inevitably fails. reply nostrademons 6 hours agorootparentThe financial industry is 20% of US GDP, and its sole purpose is \"moving money around\" (including forward in time, which Bitcoin isn't all that good at, but Ethereum is pretty effective for).

You should have looked at the data to see what fees are being paid :-) Looking at the average over the last 10 days: bitcoin users have been paying about 1 BTC in fees per block, so 6 BTC of fees per hour, or $8M per day, or $3B per year (yes, billion with a B): https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/transaction-fees-... I can't locate a source that calculates exact fees spent over the last 12 months, but per the chart above it seems to be around $1B per year. reply brokenmachine 6 hours agorootparentprevSo some miners would decide to not mine anymore, and the difficulty would automatically lower? reply basementcat 7 hours agorootparentprevPresumably at that point the network would be entirely funded by transaction fees. reply throw0101c 6 hours agoparentprev> It's a rare combination of economic incentives and technology that keeps chugging.

And a system that nobody can actually use is not a useful or functional system. Approximately nobody has a receiver for this network today. The receivers won't fall out of the sky tomorrow if war breaks out. And even if everyone did have receivers, commercial satellites are highly regulated by most nations, likely will be targeted during any future major war, and there's no guarantee they won't be coopted for other uses by their host nations. Blockstream is a tiny company and doesn't even own or operate any of these satellites. You might as well just use viasat or iridium. reply cdchn 7 hours agorootparentprevNo Internet required - just a $500 \"Blockstream\" Satellite receiver device! reply kobalsky 6 hours agorootparentIIRC you could build your own kit with a software defined radio device. you just needed a recycled satellite dish and some other off the shelf components. reply kube-system 6 hours agorootparentIf people need to put in that much work, it won't be of much use to buy groceries with it, as the kid at the grocery store can't even spell SDR. If it were me, I'd spend my effort rebuilding terrestrial IP networks over copper instead. It would be more useful. reply cableshaft 7 hours agorootparentprevStocks and bonds and commodities and 401ks and CDs aren't useful in that scenario either, but it doesn't stop people from putting most of their money into those. reply kube-system 7 hours agorootparentBut they are backed up by SIPC/FDIC which is effectively backed up by the world's most powerful military. The US's financial power is strongly linked with their ability to project military power. reply cableshaft 7 hours agorootparentWhen the war has gotten so bad that there's no internet? That's what the parent was arguing (and yeah, sure, bitcoin can't really work that well without the internet). I've got a little precious metal in case of a SHTF situation, although I'm not sure how useful even that would be. People probably care more about food or fuel or maybe some pills than they do about bartering for silver or gold in that situation. Might be able to convince a few people to go for it, but still might be difficult. reply aforwardslash 6 hours agorootparentInternet is hands-down the most fragile communication backbone a country can have; you can easily blackhole a whole country (satellite included) by just propagating \"configuration\". Most physical communication can easily be disrupted by cutting cables or by dragging an anchor at the bottom of the ocean. In contrast, a vlf transmitter can cover the globe consuming the same power as an old tv set. Its not high bandwidth, but enough for teletype.

Are you kidding me? reply cdchn 7 hours agorootparentprevI think the US government/military is stronger than the Internet. Shit the Internet isn't even that strong. In a real \"collapse of the US government STHF situation\" you're going to want to invest in beans and bullets, not crypto. reply cableshaft 6 hours agorootparentI guess my point is our world is so intertwined with the internet that if it permanently goes away we're pretty much in a 'the next war will be fought with sticks and stones' situation anyway, so what does it matter how well the military can defend those bonds and fiat. Re:SHTF for sure, which is why it's not really worth considering, unless you're so sure it's going to happen and you're already accumulating those beans and bullets (also nothing is stopping you from doing that while also buying other things in case it doesn't happen, or takes a lot longer to happen than you predict). reply aforwardslash 6 hours agorootparentYour specific country not having internet is basically a configuration issue; you can achieve that with a great degree of accuracy without cutting a single cable and without disrupting service to anyone else. There are multiple examples of this in the past 15 years,ranging from active monitoring like China does to pontual disruptions like many goverments adopted during the arab spring. reply cableshaft 6 hours agorootparentI'm aware of governments (or other situations) leading to a temporary shut down of their internet, that's why I said permanently. If it's temporary or limited to a country, then bitcoin doesn't really suffer much from that either. The blockchain will continue elsewhere and can be synched back up for your region later, or if it's everywhere, then it will just stay in a frozen state until the internet is back. So you can go to a country where there's still internet (assuming you can, you might not be able to), or wait until the internet is back up. Hopefully you have other assets or goods to get you by in the meantime. Bitcoin is too volatile for it to make sense putting all of your wealth into it anyway. reply aforwardslash 6 hours agorootparentLets assume a state-sponsored threat model, with AS blackholing.

Then there is Delphi and C++ Builder. It beat me that having doubled down on COM since how Longhorn went down, and Windows team getting their way doing avoiding .NET to take over, they hardly managed to create nice tooling as the competition.

Ah, nowadays WIL is probably the best approach when having only to consume COM. https://github.com/microsoft/wil reply QuercusMax 15 hours agorootparentprevI remember ages ago when I was about 12, I got a copy of Turbo C++ for Windows 3.1 for my birthday. (I had only written in Basic before, and wanted to learn a \"real\" programming language. My dad was a Fortran programming physicist, and had heard that C++ was what everyone was using then-a-days.) I mostly wrote simple console programs, and it came with the Borland ObjectWindows library with a fun GUI builder, but there was a section in the manual talking about how to write directly using the Windows API. I didn't really understand any of what I was reading, but I typed in the whole basic sample complete with HWNDs and all that nonsense. I can't remember if I could even get it to compile, but the idea of an event-loop was beyond my comprehension as a 12yo. I'm sure if I went back it would make a lot more sense to me, but back in 1994 it seemed like dark magic, especially compared to the much simpler and more understandable OWL components. reply dgellow 16 hours agorootparentprevAlso, UTF-16 (or WTF-16 as defined by https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/#wtf-16) reply vineek 16 hours agoprevVery nice. In similar fashion, a few years back I set out to create Wuhoo. Wuhoo loosely stands for W indows U sing H eaders O nly. It is an attempt to create a single-header library (in the spirit of STB) for graphics related window management, compatible with both C and C++. It works on Windows, Linux and Mac. https://github.com/ViNeek/wuhoo reply JKCalhoun 20 hours agoprevI did a straight C++ app for MacOS but 1) I used SDL2 and 2) it was a full-screen game so no Cocoa UI needed. It was kind of fun though in a retro-computing way. (I'm a big fan of SDL now.) reply speps 19 hours agoparentThe linked project doesn't use any ObjC files at all. SDL2 has a bunch of Cocoa files[1] so you did use Cocoa even if unknowingly. [1] https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/tree/main/src/video/cocoa reply LeoNatan25 19 hours agorootparentThe linked project also uses Cocoa, and guess what, considering Cocoa itself is written in ObjC, the linked project also uses OBjC “unknowingly”. Considering CodaFi works for Apple now, he knows. Spoiler: he knew 11 years ago too. reply anamexis 18 hours agorootparentThe OP says it is Cocoa-less in the readme, is that not true? reply electroly 18 hours agorootparentIt's not. Open up any of the .c files and you'll see lots of references to Cocoa. One of the comments refers to Cocoa by name! This is using objc_msgSend to call into Cocoa. You'd have to squint your eyes pretty hard for the claim in the readme to be true. What it doesn't have is Objective-C code, which is different than not having Cocoa. reply cancerhacker 18 hours agorootparentcheck out the clang objc rewriter - basically c++front for objc. https://www.jviotti.com/2023/12/01/understanding-objective-c... reply astrange 15 hours agorootparentDoesn't work anymore, especially because it doesn't support ARC. reply JKCalhoun 11 hours agorootparentprevYeah, that's okay.

It is mostly for engine writers to plug into Metal, instead of dealing directly with Objective-C++. reply jonhohle 19 hours agoparentprevDon’t people do that all the time with Qt? reply userbinator 8 hours agoprevUses under 1.5 MB of memory at any one time (most of it is used for drawing the window). Unfortunately there is no screenshot and I have no access to a Mac at the moment, but if View.c is where things actually happen, that is a huge amount of memory just for a (resizeable?) window with a little filled rectangle in it. The memory usage of a trivial app like this should be measured in kilobytes. Comparing applications written in the same language across platforms is IMHO a good gauge of their relative efficiency. From what I've seen, Win32 and Linux (Xlib) are pretty close but Mac is clearly very \"think different\". I'm sure the liberal use of string constants here doesn't help either. Here's a related interesting comparison: https://zserge.com/posts/fenster/ reply magicmicah85 21 hours agoprevGood example of digging with a spoon as they stated was the original goal.

Got to try it out today then. reply cornstalks 15 hours agoprevIf you want to optimize this (and you enjoy pain), you can eliminate the dependency on objc/* headers and use compiler attributes and link sections to compile your code to the same(ish) assembly that Objective-C compiles to. I don't have a C example on hand, but here's a Rust example that's pretty easy to translate to C: https://github.com/objrs/objrs/blob/master/HOW_IT_WORKS.md reply quelsolaar 3 hours agoprevWe used the same technique to port our C applications to Apple platforms, but to do so we wrote an automated tool that created a C wrapper for any cocoa API we need. It works on all current Apple platforms we have tried it on iOS,iPadOS, and Apple Silicon Macs. Its open source: https://felixk15.github.io/posts/c_ocoa/ reply 9dev 20 hours agoprevAs someone with no experience in native application development, could someone explain to me why this is significant? I have a rough idea, but I would like to understand it properly. reply lsllc 19 hours agoparentIt's an exercise in recreating how an Objective-C app works in C from first-principles. For example, the creation of the AppDelegate (see CreateAppDelegate() in AppDelegate.c) is interesting because it shows how to create a class from NSObject and attach the applicationDidFinishLaunching: method along with it's implementation in C. I've used objc_msgSend() before from C (to access the pasteboard from a CLI app), but never implemented any ObjC classes using C! It's similar how you might attempt to build a C++ class from only C components by creating a vtable. reply williamcotton 20 hours agoparentprevMacOS apps are typically written in either Objective-C or Swift as these are the officially supported languages for the MacOS APIs. The code in this template is interfacing with the Objective-C runtime but with pure C. reply rankam 20 hours agorootparentDoes this mean that, theoretically, this could lead to the ability to build MacOS apps in higher languages that interoperate well with C such as Python? I know you can build MacOS apps with Python now, but does this potentially improve the experience? reply flohofwoe 18 hours agorootparentYou can already do this in the traditional way by building an ObjC shim which exposes a C API. The solution shown here just skips ObjC and talks directly to the ObjC runtime (which has a C API but is not as convenient to use as doing the same thing in ObjC or Swift). In a highly simplified way you can think of Objective-C as preprocessor which replaces the ObjC syntax sugar with C function calls into the ObjC runtime (it's not how it works in reality, but how it could work). reply jackjeff 14 hours agorootparentThat’s essentially what this project does. It creates the C code that the ObjC compiler would generate to “implement methods” or “send messages”. It’s somewhat doable by hand because Objc is a thin lawyer. Over 15 years ago I did stuff similar to this project to call some Objc code from a C++ app. Most of it was exposed to normal C APIs but one feature only available in AppKit. It was much simpler to do it this way than figure out how to make GCC or Objc like our C++ or any mess with bridging headers. I think the move to Swift has made that harder in some ways. But then again I don’t want to write C or C++ these days if I can avoid it. reply gwking 13 hours agorootparentprevIn fact, early objective-c was a preprocessor according to Wikipedia! reply detourdog 20 hours agorootparentprevThat is what objC scripting brige is for. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scriptingbridge reply jimbokun 19 hours agorootparentprevI believe RubyMotion does basically this: http://www.rubymotion.com It was fun building an app in this a few years ago, but was difficult to keep up with updates to MacOS breaking my code. reply CodeWriter23 18 hours agorootparentprevThere’s already PyCocoa and pretty sure *Cocoa exists for a variety of languages. reply ChrisMarshallNY 20 hours agorootparentprevThat has always been possible. Also, under the ObjC layer, is good ol' ANSI C (FreeBSD Unix). There's a number of apps that run on modern Macs, that were written in C, but it is unusual to see ones that leverage the GUI. That said, it's possible to walk from Boston to Portland (OR), but I'd rather take a plane. reply ryandrake 16 hours agorootparentI knew this was possible, but I had never actually seen it implemented before. And to think, the project is over 10 years old! When I first started programming Cocoa, I was always kind of miffed that the happy-path was: \"Use Objective-C and main() should just hand-off the reigns to NSApplicationMain()\". Kind of like the happy-path on Windows is \"WinMain plus a bunch of boilerplate crud\". It's always felt somehow vaguely \"correct\" to have main() be your actual application entry point and have it manage whatever main loop you need yourself. I see that this project doesn't actually quite get there either. It's the same kind of voodoo: boilerplate code, and then cmacs_void_msgSend(NSApp, sel_getUid(\"run\")); hands over the reigns. reply billforsternz 9 hours agorootparentI agree. I recall the Windows API and the official Hello World. I'm sure they could have got to the same place in a slightly reorganised way that kept main() as the starting point and interfaced with the event loop and the entire windowing system via some API calls that hid the cruddiest parts of the boilerplate crud (apt phrasing, thank you) away in headers and libraries. Then progressively reveal the details when they're really necessary for more elaborate applications. reply williamcotton 16 hours agorootparentprevIt has to hand over the reigns to the Objective-C runtime to allow for all the messages being passed between objects. I’m not sure you want to spend your time rewriting what NSApp is doing! reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentThe runtime knows how to do that already. -[NSApplication run] sets up the runloop to drain events among other things. reply astrange 15 hours agorootparentprevWhy would you want to manage your own runloop? It's both not interesting and possible to get wrong. reply adastra22 14 hours agorootparentSometimes there are conflicting things you need to do in the same main thread. reply thenipper 19 hours agorootparentprevYou know i took the train to Boston to PDX, it was really relaxing. Not quite walking but definitely a lot different then a plane... reply jonhohle 19 hours agorootparentprevIt has, but there was also Carbon until around the Intel transition. reply LeoNatan25 18 hours agorootparentFull Carbon was there until the 64bit transition officially, but much of it remained and still remains until now. For example, Apple only started using AppKit to draw menus in Sonoma; it was Carbon until now. reply ChrisMarshallNY 18 hours agorootparentI think it’s cool that a lot of NextStep stuff is still there (all those “NSXXX” calls). reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentWait until you see the NX* APIs ;) reply nxobject 11 hours agorootparentQuick!

Just do what you want. If it means using Obj-C or Swift for ease, do that. If it means integrating another language, do that. reply swatcoder 19 hours agoparentprev> why this is significant? Ultimately, because new people keep being born and missed the years where this was pretty common and haven't yet bumped into the corners where it still is. The repo and the SO discussion it was inspired by are themselves 11 years old and seem to be rooted in a new generation of iOS app developers starting to get more deeply curious about the system they're running on and how else it might be approached, which this person then ran with on MacOS. Apple invites people to get started in making software for their platforms using (what's meant to be) more accessible tooling like Objective-C, Interface Builder, Swift, SwiftUI, etc but there's of course a whole BSD-rooted operating system sitting there once those those developers start digging. It's no secret, but it's a discovery that some people need to make on their own. reply johnnyjeans 16 hours agorootparentThe funny thing is, Apple themselves seems to have forgotten about the whole BSD-rooted operating system. Anybody who ventures off the beaten path of developing software for a modern Mac will inevitably encounter a lot of cobwebs. One of my favorites: When Apple implemented app bundles, they never updated dyld's search paths to be aware of the app bundle directory structure, meaning you have to manually patch your rpaths. Not a huge deal, and one that's hidden from you if you only ever know xcode, but it's one of many very sloppy things I noticed coming from a strong Unix background to Mac. There's a lot of really weird incongruence where the deeper you go into the system, the more everything feels covered in dust and neglected. I was always sold on Macs having really great top-to-bottom integration and have all the polish and attention to detail you can expect out of a corporate Unix-like, but that's not what I found. It's more like a really shiny superstructure bolted on top of an ancient, rust-eaten BSD. Don't get me started on how a lot of the \"newer\" stuff at that low level tends to be some of the absolute worst takes on a concept. The \"App Sandbox\" might be the most disgusting, slap-dash design for process isolation I've ever seen bolted onto a kernel. I get Apple's target market is quite literally the opposite kind of user that I am. That being said, I always find it curious that people still tout Mac as this kind of \"Super Polished Desktop/Workstation Unix\" and often cite the Unix certification. It feels like the more you try to use a Mac like you would any other Unix machine, the more you have to fight it. Often it doesn't feel any different to trying to wrangle Windows with WSL. I had less hiccups and trip-ups learning Plan 9 than I did coming to terms with macOS. reply pjmlp 1 hour agorootparentNah, this was already like this at NeXT. The whole UNIX infrastructure was to get into the DoJ stuff that required POSIX compliance. Just like with Microsoft, the approach was to allow UNIX software to come into NeXTSTEP, not to be created in NeXTSTEP and then leave it for other UNIX vendors. All the relevant programs in NeXTSTEP used Objective-C, and even the drivers were written in Objective-C. Apple was clever marketing OS X to the Desktop Linux crowd, that actually only cared about a POSIX experience and not so much about Linux itself. Many of them helped Apple get out of red, into the company it is today. This is how Microsoft finally understood how bad they did with POSIX on Windows NT linage, and out of Project Astoria ashes, WSL was born. Had Microsoft actually kept POSIX subsystem up to date, and in parity with Win32 subsystem, and most likely Linux would never taken off, as everyone would have had their proper POSIX right there, without needing to look elsewhere. reply astrange 15 hours agorootparentprev> When Apple implemented app bundles, they never updated dyld's search paths to be aware of the app bundle directory structure, meaning you have to manually patch your rpaths. Typically things like this have binary compatibility reasons. (It wouldn't be because they forgot, actually I happen to know the same person has worked on dyld since the 90s.) > but it's one of many very sloppy things I noticed coming from a strong Unix background to Mac Funny thing to complain about. Sloppiness /is/ Unix design, that's intentional. It's called \"worse is better\". On the other hand, nobody uses Plan9 because it's too well-designed to actually work. reply johnnyjeans 2 hours agorootparent> Sloppiness /is/ Unix design, that's intentional. It's called \"worse is better\". That's missing the point. It's about simplicity through well designed abstraction. Unix was a runaway game engine that became Bell Lab's standard for talking to computers because it was vastly simpler than the poorly engineered MULTICS and friends. That's why it won. > On the other hand, nobody uses Plan9 I use Plan 9 every day. I'm replying to you from inside abaco. I run a tablet with it, have a whole network of machines (most of them virtual). I'm in the middle of a project to create a light fixture I can talk to in 9p. It's not the first DIY IoT thing I've made to control over a Plan 9 terminal. My grid also runs my email, my file servers, an LLM chatbot (though this is actually served from a Linux machine via Inferno tsk tsk.) The only reason I use anything else is due to my job requiring me to ship a product in C++ and OpenGL. For something that doesn't \"actually work\", I find that it actually works excellently. reply nxobject 11 hours agorootparentprevOh wow, employed since NeXT? (There needs to be an \"Apple/NeXT long-hauler oral history\" or something. Chris Espinosa, hired 1976, is still around...) reply mattl 9 hours agorootparentAvie Tevanian and Jon Rubenstein both have oral histories on the Computer History Museum website/YouTube. reply deergomoo 14 hours agorootparentprev> I always find it curious that people still tout Mac as this kind of \"Super Polished Desktop/Workstation Unix\" and often cite the Unix certification I've always understood people to mean that it's a polished desktop operating system (though that's becoming increasingly questionable these days) that also happens to run the same CLI stuff they're used to using on Linux servers. Pre-WSL just that was a pretty nice selling point by itself. reply saagarjha 15 hours agorootparentprevApp bundles have no fixed layout.

We wanted a cross-platform C++ layer and native Cocoa front end. Objective C++ wasn’t a thing then, and having built a plain C shim previously I didn’t want to repeat the experience. We built our own bridge by registering our C++ classes with the Obj-C runtime, generating selectors for all the methods so you could send messages to (carefully constructed) C++ objects using Obj-C syntax, or even subclass from C++ to Obj-C. It was a pretty neat trick, but would’ve been difficult to port to the Obj-C 2 runtime. reply flohofwoe 18 hours agoprevHere's something similar by Garrett Bass: https://github.com/garettbass/oc ...I also experimented a bit with parsing macOS system headers via clang-ast-dump and then code-generating C and Zig bindings but that didn't get far: https://github.com/floooh/objc-ast-experiments ...with a bit of effort and maybe using libclang instead of clang-ast-dump that's definitely feasible though. I guess a similar approach is used by the official C++ bindings for Metal: https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/ ...also shameless plug: the sokol headers allow to write simple macOS applications (just a Metal canvas in a window) in various non-Apple languages (currently C, C++, Zig, Rust, Odin, Nim): https://github.com/floooh/sokol ...I'm cheating though and use ObjC under the hood to talk to Cocoa and Metal ;) reply w10-1 17 hours agoprevDraw a line through this 12+-year-old effort from Robert Widmann and his 8-year-old exercise in type-lifting Swift [1] and ask yourself: what is he doing now at Apple?

Maybe I'm crazy. reply hgs3 11 hours agoprevIt would be nice to have something like this except for Metal. I'm unsure why Apple made Metal an Objective-C API when C + Core Foundation would suffice. One big advantage of a C API is it's easy to interop with other programming languages. reply AceJohnny2 11 hours agoparentApple is opinionated about which languages should be used on their platforms, and they enforce it with these kinds of decisions. For example, there was a time where Steve Jobs threatened to forbid iPhone apps not written in Obj-C, which would have destroyed the cross-platform ecosystem, at Apple's expense. Luckily, he was talked down from being that extreme. reply extraduder_ire 9 hours agorootparentIs there any way to enforce that in a way that can't be worked around with a shim? Demanding source code? Looking for signs of other languages in the binary and not allowing them in the appstore if detected? reply AceJohnny2 2 hours agorootparentI suppose the difficulty of proving that, short of demanding source code, helped prevent it from happening. reply slmjkdbtl 8 hours agoprevYou don't need a xcodeproj at all for a pure C macOS application (or do you need it 10 years ago?

This is using what are effectively FFI interfaces to the Objective-C runtime. There’s really no good reason to do this in production code that isn’t a language bridge. It’s not as efficient at runtime as writing the functionally equivalent Objective-C, because the ObjC compiler statically allocates class/method data structures, and it’s not as safe, because you’re bypassing ARC. reply codazoda 20 hours agoprev [–] No license typically means copyright with all rights reserved in the U.S. Perhaps you want to release this into the public domain (see SQLite)? reply actionfromafar 20 hours agoparent [–] I’d say the license is: “ Use it at your own risk, and don't blame me if anything bad happens.

Even if it wasn't quite fast enough to break the current schemes that NIST is standardizing, I (and I'm sure many others) would much prefer those problems to stay in exptime. reply vinnyvichy 7 hours agoparentEDIT: discussion of bug on stack exchange (pointed from Aaronson's blog (mentor of one of the guys who found the bug): https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial... Not only that Yilei annotated with the bug his paper(p37): \"Yilei (April 18) Here is the bug: the amplitude of |φ8.f ⟩ does not satisfy M/2 -periodicity. Another way of explaining the bug is: the support of |φ8.f ⟩ contains p1...pκ vectors. After domain extension, we should have got p1p2...pκ · p2...pκ vectors, but as the way |φ8.g⟩ is written, it only contains p1...pκ vectors. So the expression of |φ8.g⟩ is wrong.\" https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555.pdf reply kleiba 17 hours agoprevI find that this is a great reaction to someone finding a bug in your paper. No trying to cover it up, but straight-up admitting a mistake. Also, the fact that he leaves the paper out because it does contain novel ideas that might be useful for further research is cool. reply baby 15 hours agoparentI had a similar thing happened to a paper of mine at the start of my career. Someone found an issue and published a paper to attack my paper. I felt like shit for a long time and thought about retracting. But then decided that my paper actually contained a lot of cool stuff, and so published an update with text highlighted in ted throughout the paper talking about the attack and about the sections that became obsolete. In retrospect I’m really happy I did the right thing. It can be nerve wracking to publish something that ends up being wrong, but being transparent and not taking things personally, and understanding that whatever happened is still providing value to a lot of people, is the right path. reply boppo1 10 hours agoparentprevYeah, this is the best possible reaction. Dude is cool. reply mchusma 16 hours agoprevI love this, great work for science overall. This is exactly the type of approach/response one should take, and I hope he gets praise for doing the right thing. reply oersted 11 hours agoprevHis \"comic slides\" are fun :) https://eurocrypt.iacr.org/2017/slides/A04-constraint-hiding... reply mellosouls 18 hours agoprevContext, eg: Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems,123 comments https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39998396 and A quick post on Chen's algorithm, 95 comments https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40056640 reply m3kw9 16 hours agoprevI find it amazing someone can even read and follow all the formulas and find a bug reply hyperbovine 13 hours agoparentThey have spent thousands, if not tens of thousands, of hours building this skill set.

Undergrad at ENS in France (ranked 1st), PhD at Berkeley (3.97/4.0), postdoc at MIT under Scott Aaronson, and now full professor at Caltech. He literally wrote a book on the topic (Introduction to Quantum Cryptography). So, yeah. reply Cyph0n 9 hours agorootparentFor context, as far as I am aware, ENS is the most prestigious non-engineering institute in France and is known for its extreme rigor. And l’X is the top engineering institute. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9ri...
