    "originBody": "War Safety¬∂ In 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, waging a genocidal war against my country. Ukraine is being hit by all types of weapons (except nuclear) daily. Home Assistant helps me stay safe and notifies me about incoming threats. We hear the siren a few times a day. Life would completely stop if we went to the shelter every time the siren goes off. So, people adapt. In Ukraine, we tend to differentiate the levels of danger. When the siren goes off, practically everyone starts checking their phones: \"What is going on?\" We have various applications and Telegram channels for monitoring the type of danger, missile paths, and understanding whether we are in direct danger or can continue with our lives for another minute. This is what war in the 21st century looks like: you can practically monitor a missile or a drone that is trying to kill you right from your phone. This is like a Black Mirror episode in real life. üòÖ There are different kinds of air alarms with varying levels of danger: MiG-31K take off ‚Äì This can happen multiple times during the day. The MiG-31K can carry a very dangerous Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile. Although it happens rarely, you can't predict when the missile is attached and when it is not, so most people tolerate this level of danger. Suicide drones attack ‚Äì Usually carried out by Iranian Shahed 136 drones. Most of them get shot down, but they are still dangerous and scary. We call them \"mopeds\" or \"lawn-mowers\" because of the sound of their engine. Ballistic missile attack ‚Äì This can happen multiple times a day. Ballistic missiles, like the 9K720 Iskander, are extremely fast (2 km/s). You have only up to 10 minutes to hide somewhere. Usually, the fastest way is to hide behind two walls (corridor or a bathroom). Cruise missile attack ‚Äì Cruise missiles, like the Kalibr, are relatively slow and fly like a plane. Nevertheless, they can fly a long distance and easily reach any point in the country. Of course, the most dangerous type of attack is a combined one. This means all of the above are raining down on Ukrainian cities simultaneously. These usually happen overnight at 4:00 in the morning. The drones and cruise missiles are used to exhaust air defenses, followed by ballistic and/or hypersonic strikes. Monitoring Air Alerts¬∂ Home Assistant has a built-in Ukraine Alarm integration. It monitors the nation-wide system of air alarms and toggles safety sensors in HA. When there is any type of danger, I send a critical notification and announce the message on my smart speakers. Of course, the air siren goes off on the streets, roaring across the city, so everyone hears the danger is approaching. But I made an automation to send a critical notification and speak at home speakers, so I certainly wake up to check what is going on. id: air_siren_kyiv alias: 'Alert: Air Siren in Kyiv' description: Air Alert announcement when we are in Kyiv. Sends critical notifications and announces on speakers. trigger: - platform: state entity_id: binary_sensor.alerts_kyiv_air to: 'on' from: 'off' variables: title: Air Alert goes off! - platform: state entity_id: binary_sensor.alerts_kyiv_air to: 'off' from: 'on' variables: title: It is safe now! condition: - alias: Someone is in Kyiv condition: state entity_id: sensor.family_in_kyiv state: 'on' action: - service: script.announcement data: title: '{{ title }}' force_speak: true # Speaks even in DND mode notify_data: group: air-alerts push: sound: name: default critical: 1 volume: 0.75 Scraping Monitoring Channels¬∂ I already mentioned we have various Telegram channels for monitoring the situation during an attack. Those channels provide live updates on dangers, flight paths, and the type of attack. So often I found myself constantly checking my phone to understand whether I am in direct danger or can sleep for a few hours. I know it sounds crazy, and normal people would go straight to the nearby shelter, but this is life in Ukraine. You don't have to follow my reckless example. If you are in Ukraine, GO TO THE SHELTER! I decided to automate it. Instead of reading these channels myself, I delegate this task to HA. I use the HA Multiscrape custom integration for that. You may ask, \"why do you need a custom component when HA has a built-in scraping component?\" Yes, it does, but I need multiple sensors from a single scrape, and I need to work with lists of data. The built-in component has some limitations with that. Monitoring Imminent Danger¬∂ Cruise missiles are usually carried and launched by Tu-95 bombers. They fly to the missile launch sites for about 3 hours, launch their missiles, then it takes about 1-2 hours for missiles to fly to Kyiv. So there's some time to prepare a hideout (in my case, it's the bathroom), gather documents, and sleep for a few hours before the \"show\" begins. Notification about Tu-95 bombers taking off Usually, it happens in the evening and means tonight will be a massive missile attack. I have a sensor that checks the Telegram channels, scrapes the list of messages every 5 seconds, and checks if the latest message contains a specific set of words, like \"take off\" and \"plane\" and \"tu-95\". It also stores the latest message as an attribute. multiscrape: - name: War Monitor resource: https://t.me/s/war_monitor scan_interval: 5 list_separator: '|||' binary_sensor: - unique_id: imminent_attack_in_war_monitor name: Imminent Attack in War Monitor icon: mdi:airplane-clock device_class: safety select_list: '.js-message_text' value_template: >- {% set message = value.split(\"|||\")lastlower %} {{ \"–∑–ª—ñ—Ç\" in message and \"–±–æ—Ä—Ç—ñ–≤\" in message and \"—Ç—É-95\" in message }} attributes: - name: latest_message select_list: '.js-message_text' value_template: \"{{ value.split('|||')last }}\" So when the sensor turns on, it means the bombers are airborne and it's time to get ready. A notification is sent: alias: 'Alert: Imminent Attack by Strategic Bombers' description: Send a notification when Tu-95 strategic bombers take off from Russian airfields. This means an attack by cruise missiles is imminent. Prepare a hideout. trigger: - platform: state entity_id: - binary_sensor.imminent_attack_in_war_monitor - binary_sensor.imminent_attack_in_operinform from: 'off' to: 'on' action: - service: script.announcement data: service: notify.all speak: false notify: true title: 'Bombers take off üõ´' messages: - '{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.latest_message }}' Direct Danger Alert¬∂ This is the most interesting sensor, which notifies me right when there's a direct threat to my location. Notification about direct danger When an attack happens at night, you need to decide: Are you going to the shelter to get a sleepless night somewhere in a basement or in the subway? Or are you going to stay in bed as long as possible to get some sleep, because you need to go to work tomorrow? Every normal person would go to the shelter. But when you live in these conditions for some time, you try to calculate the risk: You need to get proper sleep to be able to work. The air defenses are titans; they do their job excellently. Flying threats are getting shot down regularly. In Kyiv, the risk of a direct hit or hit by debris is relatively tolerable: I guess like being hit by a car (this estimate is completely unscientific!). If you are unlucky to catch a direct hit ‚Äì you are dead anyway. There's very little chance to survive that. If the missile/drone gets shot down nearby, the shockwave will blow your windows. So what do you do? It's up to you, but most of the time, I decide to sleep in bed. When things get hot, I hide in a bathroom so that when something blows up nearby, I will be behind two walls from glass shards and shockwaves. I have a sensor that watches for specific keywords like \"Kyiv\" or a neighborhood name, for \"warning\" or \"be in a safe place\" or \"fast target\". multiscrape: - name: War Monitor resource: https://t.me/s/war_monitor scan_interval: 5 list_separator: '|||' binary_sensor: - unique_id: danger_in_war_monitor name: Danger in War Monitor icon: mdi:rocket-launch device_class: safety select_list: '.js-message_text' value_template: >- {% set message = value.split(\"|||\")lastlower %} {% set in_kyiv = \"–∫–∏—ó–≤\" in message or \"—Å–≤—è—Ç–æ—à–∏–Ω\" in message %} {% set danger_now = \"—É–≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ\" in message or \"—à–≤–∏–¥–∫—ñ—Å–Ω–∞ —Ü—ñ–ª—å\" in message or \"–ø–æ–¥–∞–ª—ñ –≤—ñ–¥ –∑–æ–≤–Ω—ñ—à–Ω—ñ—Ö —Å—Ç—ñ–Ω\" in message or \"–±–µ–∑–ø–µ—á–Ω–∏—Ö –º—ñ—Å—Ü—è—Ö\" in message %} {{ danger_now and in_kyiv }} attributes: - name: latest_message select_list: '.js-message_text' value_template: \"{{ value.split('|||')last }}\" When this sensor turns on, it means there's a direct danger to me and I should hide immediately.

If you are not at the point of accepting your fate, but have already given up on attempting to get to actual shelter, you can set this up and only hide from glass shrapnel for an hour when the cruise missiles and killer drones arrive instead of hiding for hours while they fly all over the country through the gaps of air defense. For anywhere closer to the frontline than Kyiv this is almost completely useless. Travel time of even non-hypersonic ballistics, hell, even of glide bombs is so short you'd be listening to your alarm and the sound of explosions almost simultaneously. reply import 8 hours agoparentprevMost of the stuff moved to UI already in home assistant and less than error prone compared the last reply yard2010 8 hours agoparentprevWelcome to the dystopian future timeline!

This might not be relied on to the extent people's lives depend on it, but if it's important enough to use, it's important enough to be sure. All of that said, it's easy enough for me to say when there isn't such a terrifying list of munitions raining down on my home when I'm trying to get some rest, so a simple step such as \"not updating from a known-good configuration\" might be enough. reply H8crilA 9 hours agoprevThe real question is why there isn't any official API that details the nature of the danger. You shouldn't have to scrape Telegram to figure out the type/speed of the air assault weapon, and the likely time on target. BTW, also check out Kropyva, it's like Uber for artillery strikes. Very helpful with deleting Russians. reply skjoldr 4 minutes agoparentThe chief reason is decentralization. Journalists who are updating these channels have their own sources in the Ukrainian air defense network as well as OSINTers who, for example, monitor Russian radio traffic using SDR, or even sometimes have people on the ground observing the take-off of planes in Russia and Belarus (horrifically dangerous, but there are ways to send this information somewhat safely; planes tend to be loud). If one of the journalists goes down for any reason, there will be other people writing updates. Each oblast also has their own channels where they announce attacks, some of them owned by the local administration, some by the emergency services. The air defenders themselves are a bit too busy to monitor and write this stuff; often, the best they can do is to write some short messages into a group chat or a Telegram bot before things go down, and even then, all parties involved have to balance providing an appropriate warning window with not letting the timing of this information to reveal the capabilities and locations of different kinds of Ukrainian observation stations. And this whole system has to be simple, since not every trained air defender is tech-savvy in general. Many don't know what an API even is. Many Ukrainians, too, wouldn't understand how to work with an API, but they can read the warnings in Telegram. Then there are the obvious security concerns, personal communications and group chat access can be vetted and it's hard to break the anonymity of Telegram channels from the outside to even be able to target their devices with cyberattacks. While an API must be open to the world, and thus it immediately becomes a target. It's a messy system but it works. Kropyva is not available to the general public and it's very far from the capabilities of similar NATO systems, its strength lies in the fact that it's an Android app that can be used on cheap tablets, so it doesn't rely on the military-industrial complex provided hardware, which is safer, but far more expensive. reply INTPenis 8 hours agoparentprevAny single API for this would be constantly attacked. They're distributing the attack surface by using other services. reply H8crilA 8 hours agorootparentLet's not exaggerate. There are APIs that distribute the list of oblasts (regions) that are deemed to be under attack (for example https://alerts.com.ua/). The only problem is that you don't know if the attack is expected in 10 minutes, or 6 hours, and this is something that the military intelligence has, and could share with a small amount of effort. They effectively already share it via people running those channels. Also, nothing stops you from redistributing the structured messages through multiple channels. reply withinboredom 7 hours agorootparentThe problem is that you let the enemy know the detail of your intel. Using compartmentalization, they can locate leaks and determine how you are getting the intel. As a military, you never want to give that away. Looking at WWII, the UK/US were able to decrypt messages daily from the Germans (thanks to Turing!), but they pretended they couldn't so the Germans wouldn't change their encryption scheme. reply sidewndr46 6 hours agorootparentThis is a significant mistelling of the history of the German \"Enigma\" device. Significant usage of Enigma was done during the war in a manner that was secure enough to prohibit interception. Turing's methods are brilliant as are the contributions of numerous other cryptographers. They relied on numerous operational failures of some branches of the military to be possible. So it was not from \"the Germans\", but from specific branches of the military that failed to follow already established best practices reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what you mean. They used daily weather reports to decrypt the enigma for that day, so I'm not sure how that is an operational failure. If you know part of the cleartext, it's possible to brute-force any encryption given enough time. https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/how-british-cryp... gives a pretty decent summary. reply H8crilA 4 hours agorootparentprevBut they already share it, just in a messy format. No need to philosophise. reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentI'm not philosophising, this was literally my job in the military and worked with a number of analysts who worked on this sort of thing. reply H8crilA 1 hour agorootparentI see, but this military does share this very information. reply withinboredom 1 hour agorootparentThey share enough information to be useful to the civilians but not enough information to show capabilities. If everything is automated, the enemy can subscribe to the automation and work out radar capabilities, response times, and accuracy. Those are all terrible things for an enemy to use and abuse. reply dewey 8 hours agorootparentprevNot sure outsourcing it to a Russia affiliated messaging app is the best choice then. reply kwhitefoot 2 hours agorootparentWhat would you choose? reply dewey 1 hour agorootparentNot an easy questions as it depends what's popular in the local market, you need to be where the users are even if you don't like it in cases like this. Telegram also has a great bot API, which makes it a harder sell to use alternatives (Signal, WhatsApp) or open technology like Matrix, where it's only useful for people that like to play around with technology and not regular people. reply ta1243 1 hour agoparentprev> it's like Uber for artillery strikes ... reply thefz 11 hours agoprevThe fact that this exists is at he same time chilling and inspiring. reply moffkalast 10 hours agoparentI didn't think I'd ever read a programming tutorial on string matching Tu-95 take-offs and Kalibr launches in anything but a fictional setting, holy shit it feels so surreal.

And the Syria disaster. reply moffkalast 8 hours agorootparentThe counterintuitive bit is that a lot of western support for Israel also comes from neo-nazis who see Zionism as a perfect way to effortlessly remove the Jewish population from their home country and move it to Israel, like it's some sort of faraway colonial gulag. reply tomNth 8 hours agorootparentneo-nazis like old-nazis were always anti-Zionism. reply dueyfinster 10 hours agoprevFascinating use of HomeAssistant.

Most of us needed to work though so some got UPS, EcoFlows, generators, solar systems, even DIY batteries if the budget is low. This year it's more of the same. reply Hamuko 9 hours agoparentprevI imagine UPS are necessary anyways in Ukraine since the power grid is getting constantly attacked. reply mfiro 9 hours agoprevUsing technology to improve lives is one thing, but using technology to survive missile attacks is just another level. Sometime I ask myself, will humans ever stop wars once and forever. reply EnigmaFlare 8 hours agoparentI don't think that would be stable. No war means losing the ability to fight which means eventually it'll be easy enough for just one small group to attack somebody much bigger but weaker. If war is solved by all attacked countries surrendering immediately so one aggressor rules the world, I'm sure factions would emerge within it who are competing for power again. Maybe a solution could come from some defensive technology permanently outperforming offensive technology? I think people would still find a way and the wars might be or begin by psychologically changing people's allegiances. reply kjkjadksj 6 hours agorootparentThe risk of war between sacramento and san fransisco is zero.

It's positioned far away. We could all get together for a cup of coffee and discuss this topic for ages. A more grounded and practical question would be: why didn't Biden stop the war? Now we're talking! One should expect lots of contradictory opinions, quite some hostility, a couple of MTG-like personalities with followers and of course this one specific comment downvoted to hell. But see, that's exactly the point: opinions vastly differ on the same subject depending on whether the situation is a hypothetical one far away or a physical reality. reply xyst 9 hours agoprevThat‚Äôs wild.

Then still expect to grind at work in a few hours or the following day. reply walterlw 5 hours agoparentIt is wild, has been since Feb 2022, it's also \"the new normal\" we really want to get out of. (Not desperately enough to give in tho). Also keep in mind that this is only one of the stressors associated with war. Others include hearing about civilian casualties every week, reading and hearing horror stories from people who escaped occupation or were liberated (e.g. Bucha, Kherson...), learning about friends and acquaintances falling in battle, military draft, uncertain, but likely dire future prospects and the list goes on. So yeah, days go like years. Don't repeat our mistakes and write to your representatives. reply nirui 10 hours agoprevIt's 2024, instead of riding our personal spaceships to habitat on Mars, we use Home Assistant software to alert us about incoming missile attacks. War is the single most unproductive activity humans can do. Sure, maybe Putin has his rationale, but spiting on a cake is never how one can secure the cake for themself, because guess what, others can also spit on it and then the cake is ruined. A greater leader knows that the only way to really solve a problem is to do something that adds (instead of removes) value, sadly some leaders never care to learn it. Rant aside, I want to ask a question: based on the article, it seemed that the system requires Telegram (thus Internet) and open source intel to work. Is it possible to make the system self-sustained? Is it physically possible to detect imminent attack based on soundwave/light signals? Because after the war started, Internet access maybe a difficult privilege. reply egorfine 7 hours agoparent> Is it physically possible to detect imminent attack Yes. Air defense does this pretty consistently. And then what? We (Ukrainians) have lost some components of the PATRIOT air defense system because we were out of interceptors.

Good point about telegram. As much local control as possible is desirable. Do the text to speech interfaces work offline with the chosen devices ? If so, I‚Äôll likely have a play. I have a project that might be able to help with your situation. A Raspberry Pi based sound localization system. It‚Äôs very accurate. Last weekend I localized an explosion (fireworks) to within 20m from the actual location with 4 recorders. two of which were 3km from each other. Unlike most ARUs (autonomous recording units) which are based on microcontrollers and need post processing to determine an event start time, the Pi system could be used as the basis for a real time localization system as the system times is sub microsecond accurate. With likely a small amount of new development and co-operation with your friends you could be alerted in real time when artillery or gunfire is getting close to you. Along with a map location of where it was fired from My license forbids government use (attaching consequences to the small developer unfriendly cyber resilience act that is stealing from small developers and giving to rich ones) but personal civilian use is just fine. https://github.com/hcfman/sbts-aru (PS. I agree on with the sentiments of the above authors about war. It‚Äôs sad that our governments instead of putting everything into driving to peace are spending our future climate change defence money on destruction and they are gunning for it with an insane appetite) reply palata 9 hours agoparentprev> War is the single most unproductive activity humans can do. Let's wait a few decades and see the results of global warming, shall we? reply toenail 9 hours agorootparentNot sure what you're trying to say. Global warming is a human activity, global warming is unproductive, global warming is caused by one human activity, that activity is unproductive? reply palata 8 hours agorootparentNot sure if you are writing this in good faith or not, but let me assume you are: The parent said \"War is the single most unproductive activity humans can do\", without giving much details about a metric (it is very productive if your business is to build weapons, but counter-productive if your business is to save lives). But assuming that the metric was something along the lines of \"doing good for society\", then global warming is a lot more counter-productive than wars. Global warming and wars are the result of human activities (in case that was not clear). So yeah, we would certainly save more human lives by keeping our wars (I mean, without nuking the whole planet) but working all together to reduce the impact of global warming. Meaning that IMHO, \"war is NOT the single most unproductive activity humans can do\". Not that it is good, quite obviously. Does that answer your question? reply mcfedr 9 hours agoparentprevSome of the telegram channels are government run, so it's not just open source intel Of course it would be possible to detect these things yourself, you would just need an extensive radar network covering 600k km2 of Ukraine, and as much of Russia as you can.

I said this already under a (now flagged and dead) comment, but it's worth repeating ‚Äî \"your\" (not your personally) one-sided propaganda and continuing support for Putin (if indirect) have made \"you\" lose whatever anti-war and pro-West opposition there was in Russia.

Install a favorable dictator? Oh, there's a lot between not doing anything at all and repeating the mistakes from Iranian days: - provide economic / humanitarian aid contingent on progress in democratic values and actually audit where the money goes. This ended being effective around 2010 when China began hitting the global stage though. - supporting countries or democratic, pro-Western parties/groups that are threatened by an aggressor (e.g. every former Soviet state) - when supposed \"allies\" end up funding our enemies (e.g. Saudi-Arabia, who not just financed Bin Laden and is the main ideological driver in fundamentalist madrasas (religious schools) all over the world, thus being the main contributor to Islamist terrorism), cut them off. Hell the Saudis butchered a journalist (a father of U.S. citizens) in an embassy and we didn't do shit. Instead, we allow Saudi-Arabia and Qatar to host fucking World Cups. What a bunch of bullshit. - aggressive, actually effective sanctions instead of just making the lives of a few oligarchs a tiny bit more difficult - increase our own security posture in terms of military and provide a credible retaliation threat towards any potential aggressor - invest into academic research on other countries. That one got shamefully disbanded after the collapse of the USSR and the shift towards prioritizing STEM over humanities - we now lack the academic capacity for actually understanding other countries or provide actual evidence-backed advice to politicians. Instead we got completely dependent on think tanks and consultancies. - respond in-kind to Russia and China banning Western activities: they effectively force pro-democracy organizations to close shop? Fine, no more Chinese police stations in Western countries. They engage in cyberwarfare? Fine, we cut them off from the Internet. They refuse to allow Western countries fair and equal access to their markets? Fine, we ban investments from China and force-divest existing investments, and raise tariffs on their exports. The last part is the easiest... over decades we believed in \"change by trade\", we hoped that they would become similar to us culturally. That worked in certain areas - McDonald's and Coca-Cola show that - but politically, we didn't give a slightest interest in both countries getting ever more authoritarian. And now it's biting us in our collective arses. reply 5e92cb50239222b 8 hours agorootparent> supporting countries or democratic, pro-Western parties/groups that are threatened by an aggressor (e.g. every former Soviet state) Every one? I am from one of those states, and most of them are even worse democracy-wise than Russia. The only thing we have over Russia is not going after neighbors' territories, and even that's debatable (see conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan vs Tajikistan). Your governments do overlook serious human rights violations, though, when it suits them. We had widespread protests in January 2022 that were brutally suppressed by the government, which ended up killing more than 300 protesters (that's according to official figures that are thought to be undercounted). No fucks given by Western propaganda or government talking heads because several European, US, and Canadian companies have massive investments in our oil, gas, and minerals industry. About six months ago Macron visited Astana to beg for uranium fuel after France got kicked off from Niger, and a group of political activists tried to seize the rare moment and did everything they could to meet him for a few minutes and talk about human rights violations in our country. You can probably guess the result of that endeavor. One of the major gas projects (managed by Shell IIRC) ends in 2030, and I have a strong suspicion \"human rights violations\" will become a permanent theme in our relations right after that moment. reply mschuster91 8 hours agorootparent> Every one? I am from one of those states, and most of them are even worse democracy-wise than Russia. I agree, and part of the cause is that us Western countries don't give a shit. We don't even give a shit about those countries right on our border like Ukraine or Bosnia. > No fucks given by Western propaganda or government talking heads because several European, US, and Canadian companies have massive investments in our oil, gas, and minerals industry.

All talk, no act. reply vladms 7 hours agorootparent> Western countries don't give a shit People talk too easily about countries as if they are a person. I have lived in the east, I have lived in the west: every actual person has problems, everybody thinks their problems should come first, too many people have the tendency to think \"outside influence\" is very strong and lots of people think they have \"the solution\" which is different than what their government does. At the end of the day I think the (boring) truth is that many countries end acting similarly to the average citizen. Including their fears, stupidities, insecurities and knowledge. Yes, \"the west of Europe\" does not care as much as some people think about \"the east of Europe\", same way \"the east of Europe\" does not care that much about I don't know, Yemen, Myanmar or Sudan (just to name places with horrible conflicts that nobody seems to care about, unless they delay their Amazon package by a couple of days...). reply 5e92cb50239222b 8 hours agorootparentprevEh, it wasn't as much a jab against France or Macron in particular, as just an example of the general policy. Pretty much all of Europe (and US, and Canada) behave in a similar way and see us as a well of natural resources to be scooped out dry and then thrown aside. Some people here call it a new form of colonialism. Every country follows their interests and that's fine, as long as we don't hear lectures about this or that thing while those same lecturers behave in a hypocritical way contrary to what they're saying. Edit: as opposed to China and Russia that pour serious money into large infrastructure projects like the new Silk Road. Russia has only started doing this recently, though. People have their reservations about those countries, but can't help but see the difference between e.g. China that builds railroads and power plants, and Western countries that only suck out money, paying tiny salaries to local workers and circumventing things like air pollution regulations. reply ajuc 9 hours agorootparentprevAccept Ukraine to NATO in 2008 and none of this would have happened.

Basically anything that Joe did, do the opposite. In 2014, when Joe was VP and lead person on Ukraine, I would not have refused to give lethal aid to Ukraine. And when Ukraine used our training to try to take back Crimea, I wouldn't have chastised the Ukraine government for trying to resist Putin. When Putin built up forces on Ukraine's border to restart hostilities in 2021/2022, I would not have cowardly evacuated all US personnel from the country. I would have surged more in to deter. When Putin restarted invasion in 2022, I would not have conditioned lethal aid on not shooting across border, tying Ukraine's hands. Instead, I would have conditioned it on attacking any military or military supporting targets anywhere in the theatre of war. Since Russia has defined the boundaries of this as well within their country, they only have themselves to blame for how deep these weapons would reach into Russia. Then we wouldn't have the ridiculous situation we just had where Putin was able to get his forces ready for the Kharkiv offensive in plain view, but Ukraine was not allowed by Joe to attack them until they actually started crossing the border. reply onethought 8 hours agorootparentprevOr ‚Äúwe should have stopped the US‚Äù? reply GordonS 8 hours agorootparentprevnext [21 more] [flagged] IsTom 8 hours agorootparentThere was a peace deal before (Minsk agreement).

This is not that much about US or Russia interests, but about Ukrainians and they are currently fighting the Russians for 2 years. Implying they have no choice or they are only manipulated seems more like propaganda (will let the reader decide for whom). Many east Europeans still have memories about what it meant to be under Russian influence and oh boy that was shitty... No need for propaganda there. US and Russia made aggression wars, but while they imagine they are \"world powers\" they don't seem to have a great track record unless the population in that country does not firmly oppose (just the most obvious examples: Afghanistan - couple of times each, Vietnam, Ukraine) reply JKCalhoun 7 hours agorootparentprev> I mean, imagine if Brazilian intelligence backed a coup in Mexico, then built several military bases, intelligence bases and black sites across the country, then used them against US interests.

A president that caved in to Russian pressure to back out of tighter economic relations with the EU saw massive protests in response, ordered to shoot protesters, killed over a hundred of them, and then fled the country when he understood that he would be facing criminal charges. Ukrainian parliament deposed him with votes 328-vs-0. Even members of his own party voted against him. The joint spy bases were established after Russia invaded Ukraine to monitor what's going on in the invaded parts of Ukraine. > I mean, imagine if Brazilian intelligence backed a coup in Mexico, then built several military bases, intelligence bases and black sites across the country, then used them against US interests. Would the US really put up with that? Should they? The hypocrisy is real. Imagine if the United States invaded Sonora and Baja California under the excuse that they're protecting Americans there, looted factories and other businesses, established concentration camps, tortured and executed anyone who resisted, forced millions to flee their homes as refugees and gave their property away to settlers from landlocked states of the US (\"I've always wanted to live by the ocean!\"), and started forcibly conscripting all Mexican males from Sonora and Baja California into fighting against the rest of Mexico. And imagine that you blamed Mexico and its allies like Brazil for propping up defenses along the remaining border.

Sometimes I wonder if I'm exceptionally (haha) talented as I personally find the impact of exceptions on flow control pretty easy to grasp. But based on my understanding of other advanced computer language concepts, which is pretty lacking in some regards, I come to the conclusion that it can't be too hard, and people make a lot of fuss about it for no particular reason. reply eyelidlessness 3 hours agorootparentIt‚Äôs largely difficult because either: - you‚Äôre working in a language that doesn‚Äôt have checked exceptions, so the set of potential errors and the set of potentially error-raising calls is infinite but unknowable - you‚Äôre working in a language that has checked exceptions, and you hate that it makes you do work, so you catch-rethrow runtime errors that recreate the first scenario - you‚Äôre working in a language that has checked exceptions, but someone else did the second scenario so you‚Äôre in the first scenario anyway reply groestl 3 hours agorootparentOther programmers tend to be bad at reliably cleaning up resources such as file handles, locks etc, so I need to inspect the whole invocation tree anyways to have an understanding of what runtime implications I've summoned by invoking other people's code. As for myself, I've lived through the hell that are checked exceptions in Java. You learn that compositionality and checked exceptions are at odds when you try to insert a remoting layer into an application that has grown without IOExceptions. Then you learn that it's actually not necessary to know the set of possible errors, just make sure that you're not a bad programmer as in my first paragraph, and everyone will be fine. This is also something that you can learn from Exceptional C++. reply fiddlerwoaroof 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I‚Äôve never understood the complaints about exceptions either: most of the time you want the exceptions to just bubble up anyway because, in that case, you only have to think about the contracts of the functions you interact with and not about the unusual states you might be in. Return-type or return-value based error handling has always seemed to me to be significantly worse. reply xboxnolifes 3 hours agorootparentprevThe unchecked exception example doesn't seem any different than using a dynamically typed language and reading return values, and exceptions seem to get significantly more hate than those. reply eyelidlessness 3 hours agorootparentBecause even in a dynamically typed language you can generally go look at what the function returns. You can‚Äôt look at what it throws without walking the entire call stack and inspecting the source code of the runtime. reply retrac 3 hours agorootparentprevFlow control involving recursion is already well into the weeds. Recursion and exceptions is probably a nightmare for someone not fond of ML or Lisp. reply groestl 1 hour agorootparentBut why? I don't get it. You call something. It can break. It will break. Treat it as such wrt to resources you've allocated. You can ignore error details here.

I prefer the Go or Rust style of handling it through return values. Briefly skimming the language, I'm not sure if there is anything that fixes that? I think this kind of model could be cool if your IDE could dynamically determine all uncaught exceptions for a function, and lets you jump to each possible place where the exception could be thrown. Not sure how you handle coupling though. This seems like it would result in an insanely volatile control flow graph. reply mbmjertan 7 hours agoparentThis is what IntelliJ does for Java. A problem is reported whenever you have a function that throws exceptions and isn‚Äôt caught in a caller anywhere in the project, and you can jump to implementation or calls easily. However, exceptions that a function can throw are part of the function signature in Java unless they extend RuntimeException (and in that case your program won‚Äôt compile if you throw an exception without adding it to the signature). While the circumstances in Java make it much easier for IDEs to report uncaught exceptions, it‚Äôs a solvable problem for non-runtime exceptions using static analysis. On the other hand, returning standardised Ok/Err-wrapped values seems like a simpler approach, both in terms of tooling support and developer convenience. reply DarkNova6 5 hours agorootparentI think once Java has finished up exception switch-case it will be a model followed by other languages.

I prefer the Go or Rust style of handling it through return values. There is literally (literally!) no difference at all between throwing and exception and returning it as a variable. Except for the fact that in the exception passing style you have to write the boilerplate by hand, instead of letting the compiler do it for you. Why anybody with a sane and functioning brain would want to do that by hand in 2024 I will never understand. reply ratscylla 5 hours agorootparentI think people like it because the control flow of a given program is more obvious when you write it that way. No one can \"throw Foo\" three libraries down from their caller as an \"API\". See https://go.dev/blog/errors-are-values reply psd1 5 hours agorootparentprevAs an implementation detail, exceptions are usually much more expensive than just popping the stack, as computation is needed for each frame you traverse. Having both throw and return is like regex: now you have two problems. reply tylerhou 3 hours agorootparentExceptions are less expensive in the unexceptional case. Consuming a Result value requires a branch to see whether it holds Error. That is not necessary if the function returns a value directly (and throws an exception on error). reply NBJack 3 hours agoparentprevIf go didn't naturally eat error context, I'd like it more. But in the time I've used it, it makes errors much, much more painful to root cause without a debugger. reply kibwen 12 hours agoprev> Now let's see an example with toss. This is used mostly for passing multiple values out of the function. You don't really need it, but it's cute. Not useful? You've implemented resumable generators! Of course, getting them to do anything except resume immediately might be... exciting. :P Just need to structure your entire codebase as an inside-out stack of `toss`es... reply int_19h 10 hours agoparentNot quite, since with resumable generators you can resume at any later point in the program, while here \"return\" must be lexically scoped to the handler (whereas in e.g. Python you can call next() wherever). This is really more like passing a callback through a side channel. \"toss\" is invoking said callback, and \"return\" is, well, returning from it. reply boromisp 9 hours agoparentprevIt's more like stack based event propagation. reply 1propionyl 12 hours agoparentprevExactly my first thought after reading that.

But I understand the Hurl docs. Are \"algebraic effects\" basically the \"toss\" keyword from Hurl? If so, how are \"algebraic effects\" stronger than the \"toss\" keyword? reply ctenb 5 hours agorootparentMore general than the toss keyword even. If you're interested in concrete examples, you might have a look at the koka documentation reply throw156754228 4 hours agorootparentAs mentioned in another comment here, the unwind is expensive. That is, searching back through the stack finding the original call site that triggered the exception. How do algebraic effects handle that performance hit? reply fwip 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can think of algebraic effects kind of like: From callsite Foo, I call out to a function with a known name, Bar, with one or more parameters. The runtime (or sufficiently smart compiler) searches upwards in scope, for a handler Baz that provides the function with that name. Baz's Bar is then called, with both the provided parameters, and, crucially, a function that is \"the rest of Foo.\" So, an implementation of Exception with effects would ignore the resume, and look something like: define_effect Exception { // only one function provided by Exception, but could have more throw(String) } define_handler printExceptions { throw(msg, resume_func): { println(msg) } } define_func getPage(url) { request = http.get(url) if not request.ok { throw(\"Could not download\") } return page } // main entrypoint withHandlers printExceptions { page = getPage(\"https://cheese.com\") println(page.text) } But you could also write an \"on error resume next\" handler for Exception. Exceptions thrown with this handler would be equivalent to toss. (in real life you'd probably write a different effect, rather than re-using the Exception/throw effect): define_handler onErrorResumeNext { throw(msg, resume_func): { println(msg) // YOLO, call it anyways withHandlers onErrorResumeNext { resume_func() } } } withHandlers onErrorResumeNext { page = getPage(\"https://cheese.com\") println(page.text) // Probably uninitialized - a better :P } Breaking away from the Exception example, two cool examples are: // Stream - potentially infinite and/or asynchronous iterables // basically just like python generators define_effect Stream { emit(item) } define_handler toList(accumulator) { emit(item, resume_func): { if item == nil { return accumulator } else { accumulator.append(item) withHandlers toList { resume_func() } } } } define_handler take(how_many) { emit(item, resume_func) { if how_many == 0 { emit nil } else { withHandlers take(how_many-1) { resume_func() } } } } define_func fib_stream() { a, b = 0, 1 loop { emit a a, b = b, a+b } } // Usage first_five = withHandlers toList { withHandlers take(5) { fib() } } println(\"The first five fibonacci numbers are\", first_five) And this one I'm just going to lift from the Unison documentation [1]: Each.toList do a = Each.range 0 5 -- beginning of resume_func f_A b = each [1, 2, 3] -- beginning of resume_func f_B guard (a < b) -- beginning of resume_func f_C (a, b) -- yields [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)] Note that this has the same semantics as: results = [] for (a = 0; a < 5 ; a++) { // for each a, call f_A(a) foreach b in [1, 2, 3] { // for each b, call f_B(b) if not a<b { continue } // if a<b, call f_C(a, b) results.append((a, b)) } } And it is possible to do this, because these resumable functions can be resumed an arbitrary number of times - it's up to the handler. They also can pass parameters back to the resume_func. Exceptions/hurl = exactly 0 resumptions toss = exactly 1 resumption effects = 0..many resumptions [1]: https://share.unison-lang.org/@unison/base/code/releases/3.5... reply tempodox 2 hours agoprevDid I get that right that you can catch what was hurled but not what was tossed?

It looks like you can inject additional behavior at runtime using this construct. Usually in object-oriented code you do dependency injection using services's constructors, but 'toss' allows to do it using \"toss handlers\"? reply tylerhou 3 hours agoparentCheck out Koka, a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù language with an algebraic effect system. https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why-handlers reply bradrn 8 hours agoparentprevThis is quite similar to the Common Lisp conditions system‚Ä¶ which I actually don‚Äôt know much about, but I do know that it lets you inject behaviour at runtime like this does. reply masklinn 8 hours agorootparentIt's a very restricted form of conditions, since it only allows resuming. A conditions system would subsume both `toss` and `hurl` (because you can have an unwinding restart), as well as provide more flexibility: the condition can provide multiple user-defined restarts and the handler can pick between them (statically or dynamically), as well as feed content back into the signalling function. For instance a classic CL restart is `use-value` which is the conventional name of restarts feeding a default value in case of missing or invalid item. So let's say that you have a hashmap type, on lookup failure it could trigger a condition with a `use-value` handler to feed it a default value (possibly dynamically constructed), or abort/unwind, it could also have a restart to insert-and-return the value (so would behave as a `defaultdict`/`putIfAbsent`) reply mjbrusso 7 hours agoparentprevThis is similar `Resume Next` in VB reply zbentley 3 hours agoprevWow, I hate this. But it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ oddly almost kinda elegant? In a very hard to mentally model way, but even so. Speaking more seriously than is perhaps warranted, I‚Äôd slightly prefer it if there were syntactically different ‚Äúcatch‚Äù constructs for resumable and nonresumable exceptions, which would remove syntactic ambiguity around whether ‚Äúreturn‚Äù was sending control flow back to the thrower of the nearest immediate exception or not. Also, the stdlib shouldn‚Äôt have chickened out with regular value-returning functions. Just because the dogfood gives you heartburn doesn‚Äôt mean you shouldn‚Äôt eat it :) reply ceving 8 hours agoprevIs it implemented using CPS conversion? reply jokethrowaway 3 hours agoprevNice thought experiment. I absolutely hate exceptions and I'd like a language without exception. They're the goto of our time. When we have Maybe/Option and Effect/Result, there is really no reason to throw exceptions and having to mentally track where that is being handled. I'm a bit worried about algebraic effects becoming more popular (and influencing frontend JS - which is already way too complex) because it's promoting throwing \"exceptions\" to control the flow.

    "originBody": "the dumphones blog home blog dumbphone finder how to turn your iPhone into a dumb phone. In this article I show you how to turn your iPhone into a dumb phone, using a handful of simple apps and settings. You don‚Äôt have to purchase a new device just to simplify your screen time! You can use your existing iPhone to enjoy many of the same benefits. Table of Contents introduction minimal homescreen launcher plain wallpapers (that hide your dock) grayscale-only display disable notifications bonus: delete your apps conclusion introduction So, you want to reduce your screentime, maybe embrace some digital minimalism, but you don‚Äôt want to go full-on dumbphone. Perhaps, like most people, you need a smartphone to fully engage with society (like with QR menus, the bane of the dumbphone life!). Fortunately, you can tweak your current iPhone to dumb it down and transform it from a dopamine-driven-slot-machine, into something a bit more tepid. It‚Äôs a great way to temper your screen time without requiring a new (dumb)phone. Follow along with this article to dumb-down your iPhone. This article will show you how to dumb down your iPhone, with tweaks like using a minimal homescreen launcher, choosing a plain wallpaper that hides your dock, enabling grayscale mode and disabling notifications. And of course, the final boss ‚Äî deleting your apps. Note: The tweaks here might make your phone less appealing, but you‚Äôll still have access to social media, emails, the internet, etc. Dumbing down your iPhone is a great way to dip your toes into a more digitally minimal lifestyle, but it‚Äôs not a replacement for a more limited device. I hope you‚Äôre excited to get started! Let‚Äôs dive in. minimal homescreen launcher The first thing I recommend is a minimal homescreen launcher ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full-screen widget you place on your homescreen which displays a plain list of selected apps (which you can customize). I use the Dumbify launcher and it works pretty well. There are a couple of similar launchers, like Blank Spaces and on point, but both have freemium models with expensive ‚Äòpremium‚Äô upgrades. Dumbify costs $4.99 USD upfront, but has no in-app purchases; it‚Äôs what I use and it‚Äôs great. The homescreen on my dumbed-down iPhone, using Dumbify. These homescreen launchers all behave the same ‚Äî they show a plain list of app names, rather than colorful app icons, which are (hopefully!) less engaging and less likely to distract you. The freemium apps can be a good way to play around and see if this is something you want to commit to, if you‚Äôre uncertain. Just be warned that they‚Äôre much more expensive to purchase vs. buying Dumbify once their trials run out. plain wallpapers (that hide your dock) A simple, plain wallpaper is another way to simplify your phone. This was a tough one for me! I love displaying pretty photos on my lockscreen, but I decided to go all-in on dumbing down my iPhone. Dumbify includes two wallpapers you can use which match the colors of the iOS dock, and I‚Äôve included them below. By matching with the dock, you can remove all your apps from your dock for an extremely spartan homescreen (like in my screenshot above). Dark Light Just tap and hold these photos to save them, crop them to fit your phone screen, and set one as your wallpaper. You should also make sure to disable automatic light/dark mode, since that adjusts the color of the dock. You can do that via Settings > Display & Brightness > Appearance/Automatic. Tip: for a completely bare homescreen, you can also turn off the little ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù badge on your homescreen under Settings > Home Screen & App Library > Search/Show On Home Screen Note: I‚Äôve also written about using different iPhone wallpapers for light and dark mode, which is the finishing-touch on a great minimal homescreen setup. grayscale-only display The first two suggestions in this article were neat, but not that drastic. This one is! Using an Accessibility setting, you can completely gray-out your iPhone‚Äôs screen, which I‚Äôve found has made a noticeable difference to how engaging it is. Doomscrolling on Instagram or TikTok is much less appealing without all the flashy colors! My iPhone with the grayscale filter enabled. Under Settings > Accessibility > Accessability Shortcuts, you can enable the Color Filters option. By default, this will let you enable grayscale mode by triple-clicking your iPhone‚Äôs power button. It also has the handy benefit of letting you switch back to color mode with another triple-click. If you‚Äôd prefer to set this directly (maybe you use the shortcut already), you can do that in Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Color Filters > Grayscale. disable notifications I left this one until (nearly) last since I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious. Disabling (most) of my notifications was one of the best things I ever did ‚Äî it‚Äôs astounding how many nuisance notifications come through on a given day. Social media pings, random promotions, spam emails ‚Äî constant interruptions for irrelevant things. Disabling them was cathartic and a huge relief (not surprising, since notifications stress us out). I do allow a handful of notifications through ‚Äî phone calls and text messages, as well as my banking apps. Everything else though? üôÖ‚ôÇ Apple fortunately makes it straightforward to manage your notifications via Settings > Notifications ‚Äî you can customize your notification preferences per-app, and if you‚Äôre on iOS 15 or later, you can also schedule a notification summary. bonus: delete your apps The bonus tip, the elephant in the room - your apps. You can make all the tweaks to your iPhone that you like, adjust this-and-that, but if you keep your addictive apps around, what‚Äôs the point? Different people find different apps addictive ‚Äî social media is, of course, a huge one, but the internet (ie: your browser app) can be just as addictive, as can YouTube, Slack and more. Sometimes even Strava sucks me in! Whatever apps you‚Äôre addicted to, just seeing their icons on your iPhone (or being able to search for them) can act as a cue, triggering a little dopamine-driven feedback loop in your brain which sends you spiralling into another doomscrolling session. As effective as little tweaks can be, sometimes the best intervention to break a bad habit is going straight for the cue (the app, in this case). There‚Äôs a handful of popular techniques you can try out ‚Äî from going cold-turkey and just deleting all your addictive apps, to trying out social-media-free weekends, to using the native iOS screen-time feature or more advanced apps like Opal and Jomo to regulate your usage of them. conclusion If you‚Äôve read this far, all the way to the end, then thank you. I have a challenge for you: Implement at least one of the things I‚Äôve covered in this article. Even just doing a little ‚Äúnotification audit‚Äù, where you go through your notification settings and disable them for unnecessary apps, can help you reduce interruptions. Likewise, social-media-free weekends can be a great way to cut back on addictive apps without having to completely give them up. I think it‚Äôs important to note though ‚Äî dumbing down your iPhone is a far cry from a panacea for smartphone addiction. You can turn your iPhone into a ‚Äòdumphone‚Äô all you like, but unless you also delete some apps, you‚Äôll still have access to all your vices ‚Äî social media, games and more (even if they‚Äôre now grayscale). Even if you‚Äôre brutal and uninstall everything, you still have the app store and browser beckoning. That‚Äôs not to say that these tweaks aren‚Äôt beneficial ‚Äî I think they are; I think they‚Äôre a great set of tweaks to nudge you away from overuse and mindless scrolling ‚Äî but don‚Äôt expect an overnight transformation. For that, you might need to take more drastic measures. ¬© 2024 The Dumphones Blog written with ‚ô• in üá¶üá∫",

Does that mean that Usenet and IRC also are considered social media? reply Karrot_Kream 43 minutes agorootparentYes definitely. Again, audience and interests are different, but they are social media. Funny (sadly?) enough as a teenager I discovered IRC and was absolutely addicted and for a good 1.5 years spent every minute I could on IRC. I would use IRC at the school library between classes, at community college, at family friends' houses, in my own house, etc. We were poor at home but despite that I literally used any possible internet connected terminal to connect to IRC (and its resilience as a protocol made that really easy.) I had poor impulse control at that age but I do remember IRC a lot, and not in the most healthy way. Also interestingly enough text-based social media (HN, Reddit, Bluesky, X) addict me way more than video based ones (like Tiktok, Youtube, or Instagram) do. I don't know if it's because it takes longer to digest the information through video than text but I do know that I have no problem with looking at pictures and videos and stopping for days/weeks, but once I get hooked on text it's really hard to stop. I even spent a year in middle school addicted to reading books though I had other things going on in my life at the time and books were a bit of an escape. I've had waves of HN addiction and definitely enjoy X and Bluesky because of the textual media of the experience. As an adult I mostly grew out of these addictions but I can still feel their pull on me. Luckily I have enough going on in my offline life that digital life takes a backseat. If you want to think of these in terms of \"algorithms\", then IRC and Usenet have a simple \"chronological\" algorithm to display posts while Reddit and HN use an \"upvote\" based engagement algorithm. X and more \"modern\" social networks may use more sophisticated algorithms but they're all just algorithms to return a sorted order of items. reply yjftsjthsd-h 3 hours agorootparentprevSure, HN is less bad, but that doesn't make it not social media. reply echelon_musk 9 hours agorootparentprevIs Safari a social media app? reply Hendrikto 5 hours agorootparentIt can be, depending on how you use it.

Btw, I remember that apps abused the system you mentioned or used it in a way which was annoying (e.g. a messenger not choosing my default beep for every new chat and instead using system default). reply Iulioh 9 hours agorootparent----- That‚Äôs still miles away from being able to filter or categorize notifications by regexps or keywords at least. ----- Well, you can do it with apps like FilterBox reply wruza 8 hours agorootparentHonestly, I‚Äôm torn between ‚Äúandroid power users can do so much‚Äù and ‚Äúa regular app can access notifications system-wide, wtf‚Äù. How does it work? reply jdietrich 7 hours agorootparentAndroid apps can request very powerful permissions, but those permissions are specific, explicit and revocable. There's a fundamental trade-off between power and risk, but I think the Android security model handles that trade-off quite well. https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overv... https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.per... reply geokon 6 hours agorootparentMy #1 issue is that I'd love to grant an app powerful permissions if I can ensure it doesn't have internet access. But default Android doesn't expose the network permission (which exists and is accessible in ROMs like LineageOS) Of course if this was exposed then people would start blocking the Google data vaccum - and that's bad for business reply idle_zealot 8 hours agorootparentprevThere's a permission with a scary warning that it needs to request and be granted to read your notifications. reply Iulioh 8 hours agorootparentYeah, same with stuff that can interact and register what is on the screen Like a few pokemon go add-ons that can read what's on your screen and be a overlay (to distinguish good pokemon from bad) reply benterix 6 hours agoparentprevThat's why I disabled all notifications, including the ones from taxi apps. When you think of it, they're completely unnecessary as you can track the moment of the car in (near) realtime anyway, so for these 3 minutes between ordering a car and it arriving I can live without any notifications. Also, for me the \"Your driver has arrived\" is not that useful anyway as I need a minute or two to actually reach the taxi starting from putting my shoes on etc., so even this notification is suboptimal. reply ninkendo 7 hours agoparentprevI‚Äôve never used an android phone so I‚Äôm curious‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt the categorization of such notifications totally up to the developer? I don‚Äôt see any other way it could work unless the OS is doing some ML on the notifications. If I‚Äôm an app developer I could just lie and say all my marketing trash notifications are actually time sensitive/important so that you‚Äôll still receive them. Apple has a similar thing and it‚Äôs only a soft policy (that an app reviewer would have to catch) that prevents developers from abusing it. If it really is up to the app developer to categorize their notifications so that you can disable categories, then it sounds like it‚Äôs just a simplified way of managing individual apps‚Äô notification preferences, no? (Not that that‚Äôs a bad thing, I wish iOS had this.) reply ignoramous 6 hours agorootparent> I‚Äôve never used an android phone so I‚Äôm curious‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt the categorization of such notifications totally up to the developer Yes, but any popular app will have implemented it. > If I‚Äôm an app developer I could just lie and say all my marketing trash notifications are actually time sensitive/important so that you‚Äôll still receive them In those cases, your users would come to distrust your app. I reckon, only a negligible percentage of 3b Android users ever turn any notification off. More likely that some have learnt to ignore them altogether (banner blindness); swipe left to dismiss those isn't exactly as hostile as cookie banners are. Or, worse uninstall your \"misbehaving\" app (some are annoyed by notifications). reply nmussy 6 hours agorootparentprevIt is up to the developers, and most of them play ball from what I've seen. What I can tell you from a user perspective is that if they don't categorize their notifications properly, I will at the very least block all their notifications, or uninstall and look for an alternative app if possible. Maybe a developer can weigh in on the incentives this behavior creates, in terms of lost engagement or userbase reply bruh2 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's up to app developers, and some of them indeed just straight up lie with their categorization. Moovit and all dating apps come to mind. They implemented _some_ categories, but none useful ‚Äì nothing that lets you separate wheat from the chaff reply kmlx 9 hours agoparentprevto disable spam notification from the uber app: account > settings > communication > push notifications > uncheck all one more: account > settings > privacy > offers and promos > allow personalised set to Off yes, apple needs to fix this. reply bobwaycott 8 hours agorootparentAnd in the Uber Eats app, it‚Äôs Account > Communication to disable all the annoying notifications. reply stanislavb 8 hours agoparentprevOh, how much I hate the Uber notifications. Thanks for the example. They are a perfect example of abusing the system. reply drivers99 4 hours agorootparentI used Uber once, then it woke me up with a notification in the middle of the following night. So I deleted it. I still have Lyft though, without problems. reply bayindirh 8 hours agoparentpreviOS actually has two kinds of notifications. Normal and time sensitive (urgent). It‚Äôs app developers which abuse the mechanism. It‚Äôs not one size fits all. reply voytec 7 hours agoparentprevIn the Uber app, click on person icon in top-right corner, go to \"Privacy and Data\" tab, open \"Privacy Center\" and you should be able to turn off ads and promos. reply e40 5 hours agoparentprevNot true about iOS. You can make a DnD profile and let any apps you want through the filter. I use this all the time. reply c-hendricks 5 hours agorootparentThat's not what they're talking about. On Android, notifications have a \"channel\". So you can disallow certain types of notifications while still allowing others through. reply gandalfgreybeer 5 hours agorootparentThis also applies to Apple's focus modes which he was mentioning. reply c-hendricks 4 hours agorootparentSo with Focus Modes, I can allow notifications about delivery from Uber Eats while disallowing notifications about random deals from Uber Eats? reply EasyMark 2 hours agorootparentno you can't, it's kind of all or nothing. reply gryn 5 hours agorootparentprevyou're misreading the comment. this a about filtering the kind of notification from a single app. notifications from a single app are split by category, and you can disable in the phone settings notifications from a single category will keeping the rest for a single app. (though this categorizing is done by the app dev not you, so the dev can mix annoying stuff with the useful) reply kjkjadksj 6 hours agoparentprevYou can always just use the webapps and have things like uber text you. reply thunky 6 hours agorootparentFor the \"dumb phone\" target audience this probably won't work. reply onethought 9 hours agoparentprevCan‚Äôt this be handled by switching off Lock Screen notifications but keeping time sensitive ones on? I take your core point but your specific example I think is handled by that. reply ssss11 9 hours agorootparentAre time sensitive notifications new? I‚Äôve never heard of them but the setting is there for me. Using Uber as the example if I turn off Lock Screen notifications and turn on time sensitive notifications then will I get no marketing notifications, and only notifications about my driver turning up? reply darren_ 9 hours agorootparent> if I turn off Lock Screen notifications and turn on time sensitive notifications then will I get no marketing notifications, and only notifications about my driver turning up? It's up to the app developer, they get to mark notifications as time sensitive or not. So if someone decides that because a coupon is expiring soon it's \"time sensitive\" to ping you about it, then they can mark it as such. Hypothetically Apple could frown on this in app review, but it isn't something app reviewers are likely to be able to reliably catch. reply Retric 5 hours agorootparentSame is true on Android. Uber lets you disable annoying notifications in App or through settings because otherwise fewer people would use it. reply boesboes 9 hours agorootparentprevBeen there for atleast 4 years iirc reply onethought 8 hours agorootparentprevI have my Uber set that way, and yes, I just get the driver stuff. Uber eats though, I can never seem to get right, and it tries to spam a lot more. So I still agree with the original point reply bobwaycott 8 hours agorootparentUber Eats is the worst. In the app, Account > Communication is where they have you auto opted-in to endless promotional garbage. reply walteweiss 5 hours agoprev [‚Äì] Seriously, HN? You want a dumb phone, go get yourself used iPhone X/SE or something, and never install anything, but only the essential stuff. Without all the gazillion of apps, it would work wonders even in 2024. You have issues with you wasting your life on something like Facebook? Don‚Äôt install it. Use browser when needed. Use private tab in Safari, and enter your password each time, so it‚Äôs all complicated now. (That‚Äôs how I use it, btw.) Same with any other addictives. Android users, I recommend you to get oLauncher from f-droid/gplay (or better oLauncherCF), and that‚Äôs enough already. Hide all the distractions, and Bob‚Äôs your uncle. I have my phones to be the bare minimum pocket computers for years now, and I‚Äôm surprised that topic still arises and is actual. Greyscale is bullshit, isn‚Äôt it? Has anyone used it seriously for over a couple of days? Even Night Shift is kinda bullshit, in a way. (Better to leave it on, though.) The way is to not use your phone in the night, if you can afford it. If there‚Äôs no nightly drone and missiles attacks from russia in your countries now. So that you need to watch out for Air Raid Alerts 24/7. And your life is at stake. If you‚Äôre not there, chances are you can afford to not touch your phone since the evening till the morning. Think of it. The essential thing isn‚Äôt inside your phone, it‚Äôs outside of it. It‚Äôs you. Work on yourself, and those distractions wouldn‚Äôt take you that easily, even when your phone is all flashy and colourful. I know, we all have that shared problem, but I thought it‚Äôs kinda resolved issue for over‚Äì for years. Since‚Äì idk, 2017? reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "Google Meet Introduces Adaptive Audio for Seamless Multi-Device Meetings",
    "originLink": "https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2024/05/google-meet-adaptive-audio.html",
    "originBody": "Updates This official feed from the Google Workspace team provides essential information about new features and improvements for Google Workspace customers. Introducing adaptive audio in Google Meet: creating ad-hoc meeting spaces with multiple laptops Wednesday, May 22, 2024 What‚Äôs changing In this hybrid work era, we hear from customers that finding a video conferencing room to join a meeting is often difficult. With ‚Äúadaptive audio,‚Äù you and your team can join Google Meet using multiple laptops in close proximity without awkward echos and audio feedback. This is a great benefit for organizations with not enough video conferencing rooms or without resources for dedicated conference room equipment. Adaptive audio in Meet will automatically detect the presence of multiple laptops in the room and synchronize the microphones and speakers for a seamless audio experience. This allows teams to create ad-hoc meeting spaces anywhere with just their laptops where everyone can be heard clearly, without the inconvenience of crowding around a single laptop. Most importantly, adaptive audio gives users the flexibility to join meetings when meeting rooms are not available, meeting room hardware is not working, or for smaller organizations, when there isn't dedicated video conferencing equipment in every room. This also gives organizations the ability to use non-typical meeting spaces such as lounges, cafes, and other impromptu locations. The microphone and speakers of each participant are used to ensure everyone can hear and be heard well. When multiple participants are joining a meeting from the same room, ‚Äúadaptive audio‚Äù is automatically activated. Google Meet notes audio is merged and participants are grouped together in the people panel. Getting started Admins: There is no admin control for this feature. End users: This feature will be ON by default and can be turned off by the user by going to Settings > Audio > Adaptive audio. Visit the Help Center to learn more about using adaptive audio in Google Meet. Rollout pace Rapid Release domains: Gradual rollout (up to 15 days for feature visibility) starting on May 22, 2024 Scheduled Release domains: Full rollout (1‚Äì3 days for feature visibility) starting on June 5, 2024 Availability Available for Google Workspace customers with the Gemini Enterprise, Gemini Business, Gemini Education, Gemini Education Premium, and the AI Meetings and Messaging add-on.

    "commentBody": "Google Meet rolls out multi-device adaptive audio merging (googleblog.com)173 points by tfsh 3 hours agohidepastfavorite111 comments crazygringo 45 minutes agoI just want to say that this is really actually kind of mind-blowing from an audio engineering perspective. Outputting audio from multiple laptops in the same room is easy. Perfectly syncing it is harder. Implementing echo cancellation across all of that is quite a bit trickier than regular single-device echo cancellation. But then treating all the laptop microphones as a kind of microphone array, having to deal with sync issues and phase issues and background noise issues... that's hard core. Kudos to the engineering team on this one. This is actually pretty amazing. reply nytesky 14 minutes agoparentTechnically very impressive, and meets a real need. My office is still running telecom hardware from a decade ago, all the wireless mics have dead batteries, and is reluctant to replace since so many meetings are completely virtual, so why have custom in office hardware. This essentially replaces that expensive proprietary hardware with a matrix of laptops, and essentially every user gets a mic. But it only works on laptops right, not phones? reply iandanforth 39 minutes agoparentprevDo you think they are using some kind of inaudible-to-humans signal to coordinate this or is the unmodified audio good enough? reply vineyardmike 36 minutes agorootparentUnmodified audio is good enough, but using some signaling sound would improve coordination. reply varispeed 25 minutes agoparentprevAlso imagine that 44.1kHz on one laptop will not equal 44.1kHz on another or one can run at 96kHz and others on 44.1kHz etc. that means everything has to be dynamically resampled in realtime whilst preserving quality and low latency. reply lelandfe 13 minutes agorootparentYou‚Äôre making me think about what they do with malfunctioning speakers and mics. My laptop‚Äôs left speaker is considerably louder than the right, and there can be bad sibilance with louder noises. They might want to treat such audio with suspicion when calculating the room. It reminds me of the Byzantine generals problem, though I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs ultimately quite dissimilar. reply paul7986 13 minutes agoparentprevEngineering team or some hard working dreamers who Google invited to do business with and stole their work https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18566929 That's a big part of the Silicon Valley playbook..stealing from the little guy...overall excited for chatGPT to crush Google as well looking forward to a future chatGPTt phone created alongside Microsoft (its branding should be chatGPT tho). reply jeffrallen 27 minutes agoparentprevIf you were doing this kind of multipath and array signal processing on RF signals, it would be covered by ITAR. And yet Google can ship it anywhere on the planet via HTTPS and webasm... Things that make you go hmm. reply nevir 2 hours agoprevMeet, to me, is the perfect balance of functionality and simplicity (as an end user). And features like this only make that more apparent. Zoom and Teams always frustrate me, even though they're what I use far more often. It's too bad that video conferencing is largely a game of who has the most boxes checked - IT admins and A/V folk are the ones that need to be convinced, and Meet just doesn't ...meet... their needs reply alkonaut 1 hour agoparentIt very rarely matters which product is \"better\" in any objective sense. If you are team that work with Teams, your meetings will be on teams. Teams could be much worse than Zoom or Meet, you wouldn't move your group from Teams for one meeting anyway. reply sixothree 26 minutes agorootparentWe work with a lot of external customers. Teams, GotoMeeting, GotoWebinar, Skype, Google Meet, Zoom. And honestly, they all suck. Getting logged in is always a problem. Setting my name permanently is literally always a problem (I have zero idea why). Viewing someone elses screen always stinks because the scaling is just not good. On top of that you can't compare Teams to Google Meet because literally every organization has theirs configured differently. For some organizations, I can use my phone for audio. For others I can only use my laptop. So it's never an Apples to Apples comparison. Sometimes you have access to chat history; other times if you reconnect you lose chat history. The differences inside a product go on and on. reply stavros 2 hours agoparentprevMeet frustrates me immensely because I can't just fullscreen someone sharing an HD screen onto my HD screen and get 1:1 pixels with an overlay of faces (like Zoom does). Instead, I have to either not be able to read small text, or awkwardly pan in the recently-added \"zoom\" view. reply blumomo 50 minutes agorootparentYou get near full screen watching a shared screen with Meets with these steps: 1. change Meets call layout to one video (presentation) only, disabling participant watching 2. press F11 to make browser go full screen 3. press Ctrl+Minus multiple times to decrease UI elements which makes the shared video near full screen reply stavros 44 minutes agorootparentI'll try that, thanks! reply pimlottc 25 minutes agorootparentprevIt is pretty frustrated how limited the layout options are. The best workaround is to open a second Meet window and join the meeting in \"companion mode\" [0]. Then you can at least position the windows how you like, with each focusing on a different thing. 0: https://support.google.com/meet/answer/11295507?hl=en reply CitrusFruits 1 hour agorootparentprevYeah I feel like with a couple UI tweaks or options Meet would be the best by far. It's just so much more convenient and accessible than the others. reply anon84873628 24 minutes agorootparentJust in case any Meet engineers are reading... It needs to let me put my self-view right under the webcam lens, so I can stare at myself and still be looking at the camera. reply stavros 1 hour agorootparentprevI definitely agree, needs no installation, things just work, quality is good, has nice features like push-to-talk, etc. It's great, there are just some tiny UX niggles that could be solved very easily but haven't been, yet. reply matsemann 38 minutes agorootparentIt's horrible slow on some computers/browser combos, which is my main gripe with it. Video quality is also much worse, but doesn't matter too much to me. And as with all Google stuff the UX is kinda weird and non-intuitive. What does all the different join options do? When should I use what? Why must all presentations be so small if I also want to see the presenter? Zoom is much better here. reply novok 2 hours agoparentprevMeet's GUI eats screen space and reduces the size of video feeds as a result with not being able to do anything about it. It took years for it to let you choose audio and video sources from the button itself like zoom has had forever and forced you to go into the setting panels and tap on 4 screens. Same with video feed layouts. I really dislike meet compared to zoom. Zoom also transmits much higher quality video and screen share feeds than meet does. This new feature is very impressive although, most echo cancellation is \"mute everyone except one speaker\" which leads to walkie-talkie style half-duplex talking, which really hurts normal communication flows. I wonder how they do it here. reply buro9 1 hour agoparentprevIf Meet did \"autorecord\" combined with \"autoshare recording with recipients\" (specifically including Google Group recipients)... then it would be perfect. As it is, we're gradually shifting more things to Zoom where that's either part basic functionality, or part easy to automate as things like Zapier are well integrated into the API. We only use Meet for team meetings now, and we did use Gong.io to solve the above... but Gong is pretty expensive just to allow those who were out that week to catch up on a recording when they're back and if they care to. reply samcheng 1 hour agorootparentHmm. We natively record and transcribe many meetings via Meet. Maybe it‚Äôs a function of the plan we‚Äôre on? I wouldn‚Äôt want ‚Äúautorecord‚Äù though - it‚Äôs better for culture and rapport to not feel like every conversation is ‚Äúon the record.‚Äù reply buro9 1 hour agorootparentWell I'd hope that's a property of a specific meeting and not all meetings, but team weeklies where those not present want to catch up, and the recording is only going to those regular attendees (members of a specific Google Group)... sure, that's a thing we would like to have. reply nicd 1 hour agorootparentNot sure what Gong's pricing is, but we evaluated a few different notetakers and settled on https://fireflies.ai/. $18 / month gets a recording and summary sent out to all invitees to the calendar invite, uploaded into Hubspot, etc. Very valuable for our sales calls. reply Szpadel 1 hour agoparentprevI used many video conferencing systems over the years and I meet is my favourite usually there is need to some third party extension/application that have usually does not support Linux or if Linux is supported, they explicitly ban Wayland/pipewire (I'm looking at you slack) but for need they stick to web standards therefore this works in any web browser you might have also it tends to not consume every CPU cycle you have (slack again) so you can do so something while you eg screen sharing reply dgellow 46 minutes agoparentprevMy Meet calls always end up pixelated, where Zoom looks perfect. That‚Äôs basically the only thing I care about after the audio quality, I often cannot read someone‚Äôs screen when shared via Meet. Zoom also feels lower latency but I never checked if that‚Äôs the case. Note sure if that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not in the US. reply cloudwalking 2 hours agoparentprevAgree, I find Meet is the simplest and works the best. I really appreciate the audio filtering -- don't ever hear colleague's typing or dogs barking or lawn mowing. reply mulderc 1 hour agoparentprevI have always had way more issues with meet than zoom. Guessing it is something about browser compatibility but participants regularly have issues with mics and cameras that I don‚Äôt see with zoom. reply contrarian1234 1 hour agoparentprevMeet requires a Google account to attend a video call while Zoom does not. So if your hosting a meeting with strangers, using Meet is not user friendly. At least personally I refuse to make a Google account bc it requires giving Google my phone number... But I know that's a bit of technoludditism in the current zeitgeist reply loosescrews 1 hour agorootparentThis is only true for meetings created with free gmail accounts. If use Google Workspace this limitation does not apply. reply behnamoh 44 minutes agorootparentThat's a shady tactic right there. reply jasonvorhe 21 minutes agorootparentWhat's so shady about that? It's not like they're advertising a feature to free Gmail users only to up sell them to workspace? reply whstl 1 hour agorootparentprevIs this new? I have definitely joined Meets calls from my personal laptop and I don't have a personal Google account. This includes my last job interview, and, well, I got the job. Perhaps it's meeting specific, or organization specific? reply varispeed 24 minutes agoparentprevThe organisation I worked at used Meet until someone from Microsoft convinced them to use Teams. Such a nightmare. Quality of meetings went downhill and employees were penalised for secretly using Meet for ad hoc meetings. reply bongodongobob 51 minutes agoparentprevAs an \"IT admin\", it's not that I need convincing. It's that the rest of Googles \"office\" products are absolute amateur hour and support is non-existent. reply jamesrr39 15 minutes agorootparent> the rest of Googles \"office\" products are absolute amateur hour Not quite sure about this. Gmail (both personal and company accounts) is IMO a great email client with loads of handy features, and I always felt Google Docs/Sheets/Slides/Drawings were well put together. Are they the best in class? I guess it depends what you are looking for. Could Drive be faster? Yes, that would be nice. But \"amateur hour\" sounds like we are simply using different products. reply nradov 1 hour agoparentprevThis isn't an area where simplicity wins. Zoom is targeted more towards professional use whereas Meet is more for casual or social use. It doesn't really support multiple displays, like I can't watch screen sharing on one display while moving the chat and video windows off to another display. Scaling options for screen sharing are inadequate and it doesn't even support real full screen display. Meet lacks advanced audio options that make it unusable for things like music lessons. Zoom has more third party integrations available. reply pquki4 1 hour agorootparentI think because Meet is fully browser based, some of the features like sharing audio with screen are only available via chrome or chromium based browsers -- definitely not on Firefox in my own testing. I don't know the exact reason for that, but it's kind of sad. reply ChuckMcM 50 minutes agorootparentWhich is why I don't use Meet. reply kccqzy 30 minutes agorootparentThat's exactly the reason I use Meet. I don't want native code execution; I want sandboxed JavaScript code execution. reply ChuckMcM 6 minutes agorootparentThat's fair. Everyone comes to these sorts of positions with a stack of values[1]. How that stack is ordered often determines one's choices. One of the interesting things for me from a technological perspective is whether or not we're converging on what the ideal set of features for a \"video phone\" would be. If there was a broad enough consensus on the core feature set I would hope an 'appliance' version would be available which would eliminate needing to use a general purpose processor (and all the risks that entails) for this sort of meeting. [1] From your response I infer that you value \"no native code\" and \"sandboxed javascript\" highly which guides you to the choice to use Meet, vs someone who might stack \"User Experience\" more highly than those two and end up at a different choice. reply moralestapia 33 minutes agoparentprevAgree that Meet is the superior experience. Unfortunately, it's only a matter of time until one their VPs decides to \"improve it\" with the usual imbecile ideas they come up with. >Google Meet now scans all your files so they can get shared automatically with all members on the meeting when it is appropriate to enrich the conversation. You cannot opt-out this feature. reply r00fus 2 hours agoparentprevMeet‚Äôs default audio noise cancellation is pathetic compared to Zoom. Initial Teams was also poor but has improved. My daughter‚Äôs school uses Zoom for her IEP where at least one attendee is remote that day. Not a fun experience. reply nh2 12 minutes agoprevI want a simpler feature: Auto-detect people not using headphones, and prevent them from speaking. Until they put some one. Ideally showing them some customisable scolding message. So far, any feedback / echo cancellation I've encountered just makes everybody's life miserable. Degradation to non-duplex voice (because all except the loudest speaker are attenuated down), \"seaside noise\" effect\", etc. This is the reason why a phone call over GSM or landline still often \"feels\" better than any HD video call with people on screens: Low-latency duplex audio. Most* of this goes away if you just wear headphones. Maybe this can be fixed by making the algorithm way more complicated, as the announced feature does. But I'd be surprised. [*]: \"Most\": 2 people with headphones sitting near each other still cause echoes for each other and other participants. Fixing that is truly novel, and needed even for headphone users. reply maliker 9 minutes agoparentAnd then there's another nag prompt if bluetooth headphones/mic are detected. The latency on those things can get horrendous, up to like 300 ms. reply pachico 1 hour agoprevGitLab offers a nice course about transitioning to remote work. One of the items in their guidelines about online meeting is not having hybrid meetings. This is, all those attending must attend from their own device rather than the meeting room one (see Jabra) precisely for the reasons this feature tries to address. reply Rastonbury 1 hour agoparentIt gets complicated when half a team is in the office taking the same call from their desks, easier for Gitlab because they are full remote reply unixhero 1 hour agorootparentThis does not complicate matters. reply emptysongglass 1 hour agorootparentIt does in ways you likely don't understand. At large enterprises with satellite offices, most of us don't want to sit at our desks and annoy our coworkers who are also in-office by taking calls at our desks. That leaves meeting rooms, which are at a premium. Full single device for everyone would mean either everyone loudly shouting at their desks from within their noise canceling headphones or the company giving everyone an office with a door. As even Google doesn't do this for their employees, this is the next best thing we can do to save the sanity of our coworkers and respect remote colleagues dialing in by including them in a shared room meeting. reply benterix 1 hour agoparentprevRules are meant to be broken. I've participated in many meetings where, for one reason or another, some participants couldn't join in person. Making it easier - for them and for us - is a technical challenge, and not something to be decided by an arbitrary rule. reply djtango 1 hour agorootparentRemote is extreme and is still not the norm. It is easier to baseline on things optimised for remote then relax than try to shoehorn in person into remote which is then doomed to fail. I worked for a company that was headquartered in London and had satellite offices in Spain and Germany. After we all went remote during the pandemic the EU offices said they felt so much more engaged with the rest of the company because they were no longer disadvantaged by default for not being in HQ and in person bad habits were penalizing them reply pquki4 1 hour agorootparent\"doomed to fail\" Its definitely doomed to fail if CEOs want you to think it's doomed. Your comment is handwavy with words like \"feel\" and \"bad habits\". There are real issues with remote work, but there are also ways to mitigate the downsides of it. It's easier for some people to just dismiss the idea entirely and pretend that in-office work is the better alternative without any problems. I have definitely seen that happen in my company and here. reply djtango 54 minutes agorootparentYes - my response was to the rejection that rules are to be broken. I have worked there fully remote jobs and the ones that did it best fully leaned into being remote. There is no hard or fast rule, I've been in a team social where I was the only person remote and it still felt relatively natural. I've done a fully remote follow a recipe and cook at home session which was also pretty fun. I've also been in places that do the bare minimum of what constitutes remote \"oh we use Zoom and screenshare\" and dictate to people where everyone is cam off. And the difference is night and day. I think that a little bit of cargo culting wrt remote etiquette is probably a net good thing because I posit many people still don't know what good looks like. reply _joel 1 hour agorootparentprev\"Remote is extreme\".

In the video conf world, where most problems are well solved, this is such an amazing feature to differentiate and be customer first! reply indymike 1 hour agoprevI just exited my startup and now work for a much bigger company. I'm going from a Google-based productivity stack to a Microsoft one, and so far Teams is the worst and best change. Google Meet was fantastic for \"just working\" especially for less sophisticated meeting guests. The only time Meet didn't work is when corporate IT departments at customers actively blocked Meet so their minions used the \"approved meeting solution\". As far as Teams vs. Meet, it seems like Teams is great when you are working with people that have climbed it's learning curve. Teams is also filled with UX paths where it takes one or two extra clicks (and thoughts) to do simple things like share a file. reply benterix 1 hour agoparent> As far as Teams vs. Meet, it seems like Teams is great when you are working with people that have climbed it's learning curve. Can you give one example? reply stackskipton 1 hour agorootparentI can give several. Most of them are not Meet specific but how Meets integrates with rest of Google Products. This is actually overall massive problem with Google Workspaces in general IMO. 1) You can call someone in Teams. Sure, Google Chat has \"Start Meeting now\" but it's very passive. I know some will see this as negative but ringing has massive advantages around UX. 2) Chat, Teams will persist chat after meeting ends. In fact, depending on how you hold the meeting, it might dump the contents into chat channel so it's preserved in more open manner. 3) You can have visible meetings. You can start a meeting in a Teams chat channel so everyone can see the meeting is going on. It creates that in the office feeling of two people working on a whiteboard nearby that if topic interests you, you can join in. 4) Sharing Documents, Add Word Document to meeting, everyone is granted permissions. Done. The fact so many Google Workspaces companies have Slack is just frustrating. You have these two products that barely talk. reply NayamAmarshe 53 minutes agoparentprev> I just exited my startup and now work for a much bigger company.

Too bad I'm not automatically Facebook friends with all my co-workers! reply foreigner 2 hours agoprevDo any of the video call services support full duplex audio? It feels so stifling to have to be perfectly silent while others are speaking, compared to the give and take of a normal conversation. reply crazygringo 40 minutes agoparentPretty sure literally all of them do, but generally only full duplex. Not triplex or quadruplex etc. In other words, if you're having a 1-1 video call, both of you have your audio working at all times. But as you go to 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 participants, it generally continues to be just max 2 simultaneous audio streams, determined by whoever has been the loudest recently. Unless you turn on special features like music mode etc. This is a feature, not a bug, because otherwise background noise and sounds would start adding up to become intolerable. (Why we usually try to intentionally stay on mute anyways, so we don't accidentally become even just that second audio stream.) reply stavros 2 hours agoparentprevYes, all of them. Wear headphones. reply Groxx 41 minutes agorootparentTo +1 this, yes, every single one AFAIK. What you're running into is almost certainly noise cancelling. It's turning off your incoming audio so it doesn't intrude on your microphone picking up your voice. Disabling or tweaking noise cancelling or audio modes (i.e. to \"headset\") on basically every meeting software will eventually get you a combination that doesn't do this. It's sometimes a bit hidden though, and many have chosen to just say \"everyone gets maximum noise cancelling\" rather than trying to guess based on your audio device(s) so it doesn't always do it automatically or obviously. reply stavros 33 minutes agorootparentMinor correction: it's echo cancelation, not noise canceling. reply simonbarker87 2 hours agoparentprevI feel like Zoom does the best job of the corporate offerings. Google Meet feels like the worst and most stifling. I was talking to someone who specialises in corporate communication at a conference last week and she confirmed my feeling above as well.

Discord is more like a LAN party. reply jpalomaki 2 hours agorootparentprevMight be also related to the delay in communications. There's the time the packets traverse the networks, but also delays due to buffering to accommodate poor connections. reply toast0 1 hour agorootparentTotal audio delay is from record buffering, sampling (typically 20 ms samples), encoding, packetization (1-5 samples per packet), time in transit, decode, jitter buffer, playout buffer. You could reduce sample size, and send fewer samples per packet to reduce total delay, but overhead goes way up (overhead is near 50% at 20ms samples, one per packet). In theory, you should be able to do something nice for people doing audio and video by including audio on the video packets, but it's not simple, so I think most conferences don't do it. reply pquki4 1 hour agoprevMy company has conference rooms that have specialized hardware for Microsoft Teams meetings. The audio really sucks -- everyone must project their voice for people joining online to hear. If someone speaks in a low voice, nothing can be heard on Teams even though it is clear enough for people in the room. I don't understand how we haven't solved this problem yet. The functionality here seems interesting, but I assume only works well if everyone or almost everyone brings a laptop. It probably won't work well for those situations where only one or two people take their laptops to an in-person meeting. reply anotheryou 35 minutes agoprevSurround sound from the speakers next :)? I however think (emulated) stereo sound and low latency would do wonders. Sadly this feature here will only introduce latency.

Then the phone could boost my voice from multiple mics and filter out background noise. reply andai 1 hour agoprevSounds imprrssive, but also overengineered? Don't headphones solve the same problem? Though I guess in a hybrid meeting they'd make it harder to hear the people in the room. (But you'd hear them through the laptop, normally?

It can happen on any service and it means the echo cancellation on their end got confused -- it's an adaptive algorithm but occasionally adapts wrong. Best way to fix it is to mute yourself for ~5 seconds and then unmute, which should reset their echo cancellation algorithm. If that doesn't fix it, then have both of you pause and not talk for ~5 seconds. This should absolutely reset it, as the echo cancellation algorithm has now definitively learned what silence is supposed to sound like. reply moomoo11 1 hour agoprevMeet is nice, but could the screen sharing view just please take 100% height/width?

The UI is extremely slick, and getting a comfortable setup is nicer (to me) than tmux or screen. Unfortunately, it's missing one key feature that keeps me from using it as a daily-driver: it doesn't appear to be possible to attach to an existing session by automatically creating a new tab or pane. iTerm2 has fantastic integration with tmux that allows it to directly create a new tmux tab for every native iTerm2 split or tab, and I was hoping to recreate that with Zellij, outside of iTerm2. It _is_ possible to open a new tab with the `new-tab` action (or whatever it's called), but unfortunately, there's no way to do that \"in the background\": one of your open sessions always switches to that new tab when it opens. I don't know if this is a limitation of the session/tab system, but when I dug through the source, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why this was happening. I did spend some time trying to contribute a flag to allow attaching to existing sessions with a new tab/pane, but the actual architecture in place back then made this very difficult to support without non-trivial refactoring (and at least at the time, Zellij wasn't accepting any major contributions that weren't directly aligned with the roadmap, which I respect: there's only enough time in the day to review random PRs). I check back periodically; if this is made possible at some point, I'd love to switch to it. reply resonious 17 hours agoparentI'm a Linux user so of course I think like this, but: why use the native terminal tabs?

I'm used to the keybindings, and the behavior for navigating tabs/splits/panes (across macOS, Windows, and Linux).

    "title": "Facial Recognition Error Leads to Wrongful Shoplifting Accusation in UK Store",
    "originLink": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-69055945",
    "originBody": "'I was misidentified as shoplifter by facial recognition tech' Published 19 hours ago Share By James Clayton BBC Newsnight Sara needed some chocolate - she had had one of those days - so wandered into a Home Bargains store. \"Within less than a minute, I'm approached by a store worker who comes up to me and says, 'You're a thief, you need to leave the store'.\" Sara - who wants to remain anonymous - was wrongly accused after being flagged by a facial-recognition system called Facewatch. She says after her bag was searched she was led out of the shop, and told she was banned from all stores using the technology. \"I was just crying and crying the entire journey home‚Ä¶ I thought, 'Oh, will my life be the same? I'm going to be looked at as a shoplifter when I've never stolen'.\" Facewatch later wrote to Sara and acknowledged it had made an error. Facewatch is used in numerous stores in the UK - including Budgens, Sports Direct and Costcutter - to identify shoplifters. The company declined to comment on Sara's case to the BBC, but did say its technology helped to prevent crime and protect frontline workers. Home Bargains, too, declined to comment. It's not just retailers who are turning to the technology. On a humid day in Bethnal Green, in east London, we joined the police as they positioned a modified white van on the high street. Cameras attached to its roof captured thousands of images of people's faces. If they matched people on a police watchlist, officers would speak to them and potentially arrest them. Unflattering references to the technology liken the process to a supermarket checkout - where your face becomes a bar code. Image caption, A police facial-recognition van's cameras can capture thousands of images On the day we were filming, the Metropolitan Police said they made six arrests with the assistance of the tech. That included two people who breached the terms of their sexual-harm prevention orders, a man wanted for grievous bodily harm and a person wanted for the assault of a police officer. Lindsey Chiswick, director of intelligence for the Met, told the BBC the tech's speed was extremely helpful. \"It takes less than a second for the technology to create a biometric image of a person's face, assess it against the bespoke watchlist and automatically delete it when there is no match.\" The BBC spoke to several people approached by the police who confirmed that they had been correctly identified by the system - 192 arrests have been made so far this year as a result of it. But civil liberty groups are worried that its accuracy is yet to be fully established, and point to cases such as Shaun Thompson's. Mr Thompson, who works for youth-advocacy group Streetfathers, didn't think much of it when he walked by a white van near London Bridge in February. Within a few seconds, though, he was approached by police and told he was a wanted man. \"That's when I got a nudge on the shoulder, saying at that time I'm wanted\". Image caption, Shaun Thompson says he was a victim of mistaken identity He was asked to give fingerprints and held for 20 minutes. He says he was let go only after handing over a copy of his passport. But it was a case of mistaken identity. \"It felt intrusive‚Ä¶ I was treated guilty until proven innocent,\" he says. The BBC understands the mistake might have been due to a family resemblance. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment. 'Digital line-up' Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, has filmed the police on numerous facial-recognition deployments. She was there the night Shaun Thompson was picked up by police. \"My experience, observing live facial recognition for many years, [is that] most members of the public don't really know what live facial recognition is,\" she says. She says that anyone's face who is scanned is effectively part of a digital police line-up. \"If they trigger a match alert, then the police will come in, possibly detain them and question them and ask them to prove their innocence.\" The use of facial recognition by the police is ramping up. Between 2020 and 2022 the Metropolitan Police used live facial recognition nine times. The following year the figure was 23. Already in 2024 it has been used 67 times, so the direction of travel is clear. Champions say that misidentifications are rare. The Metropolitan Police say that around one in every 33,000 people who walk by its cameras is misidentified. But the error count is much higher once someone is actually flagged. One in 40 alerts so far this year has been a false positive. Michael Birtwhistle, head of research at the Ada Lovelace Institute research group, believes the technology is so new that the laws have not yet caught up. \"I think it absolutely is a Wild West at the moment. That's what creates this legal uncertainty as to whether current uses are unlawful or not,\" he says. In Bethnal Green, although some people the BBC spoke to were worried about the use of the tech, a majority were supportive - if it helped to tackle crime. That leads to another question about the technology: will it help in the long run? As people get more used to seeing white vans parked on busy high streets, will people who know they are wanted by police simply get wise to the cameras and avoid them? Will shoplifters hide their faces? Ms Carlo says society needs to guard against facial recognition becoming normalised. \"Once the police can say this is OK, this is something that we can do routinely, why not put it into the fixed-camera networks?\" This is the dystopian future that civil-liberty campaigners are most afraid of - a China-style mass-surveillance state. Advocates dismiss such dire predictions as overblown. And it is also clear there are plenty among the public who are willing to put up with having their faces scanned - if it means safer streets.

Example Production Meeting Minutes Bibliography Simplicity Written by Max Luebbe Edited by Tim Harvey The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. C.A.R. Hoare, Turing Award lecture Software systems are inherently dynamic and unstable.38 A software system can only be perfectly stable if it exists in a vacuum. If we stop changing the codebase, we stop introducing bugs. If the underlying hardware or libraries never change, neither of these components will introduce bugs. If we freeze the current user base, we‚Äôll never have to scale the system. In fact, a good summary of the SRE approach to managing systems is: \"At the end of the day, our job is to keep agility and stability in balance in the system.\"39 System Stability Versus Agility It sometimes makes sense to sacrifice stability for the sake of agility. I‚Äôve often approached an unfamiliar problem domain by conducting what I call exploratory coding‚Äîsetting an explicit shelf life for whatever code I write with the understanding that I‚Äôll need to try and fail once in order to really understand the task I need to accomplish. Code that comes with an expiration date can be much more liberal with test coverage and release management because it will never be shipped to production or be seen by users. For the majority of production software systems, we want a balanced mix of stability and agility. SREs work to create procedures, practices, and tools that render software more reliable. At the same time, SREs ensure that this work has as little impact on developer agility as possible. In fact, SRE‚Äôs experience has found that reliable processes tend to actually increase developer agility: rapid, reliable production rollouts make changes in production easier to see. As a result, once a bug surfaces, it takes less time to find and fix that bug. Building reliability into development allows developers to focus their attention on what we really do care about‚Äîthe functionality and performance of their software and systems. The Virtue of Boring Unlike just about everything else in life, \"boring\" is actually a positive attribute when it comes to software! We don‚Äôt want our programs to be spontaneous and interesting; we want them to stick to the script and predictably accomplish their business goals. In the words of Google engineer Robert Muth, \"Unlike a detective story, the lack of excitement, suspense, and puzzles is actually a desirable property of source code.\" Surprises in production are the nemeses of SRE. As Fred Brooks suggests in his \"No Silver Bullet\" essay [Bro95], it is very important to consider the difference between essential complexity and accidental complexity. Essential complexity is the complexity inherent in a given situation that cannot be removed from a problem definition, whereas accidental complexity is more fluid and can be resolved with engineering effort. For example, writing a web server entails dealing with the essential complexity of serving web pages quickly. However, if we write a web server in Java, we may introduce accidental complexity when trying to minimize the performance impact of garbage collection. With an eye towards minimizing accidental complexity, SRE teams should: Push back when accidental complexity is introduced into the systems for which they are responsible Constantly strive to eliminate complexity in systems they onboard and for which they assume operational responsibility I Won‚Äôt Give Up My Code! Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their creations, confrontations over large-scale purges of the source tree are not uncommon. Some might protest, \"What if we need that code later?\" \"Why don‚Äôt we just comment the code out so we can easily add it again later?\" or \"Why don‚Äôt we gate the code with a flag instead of deleting it?\" These are all terrible suggestions. Source control systems make it easy to reverse changes, whereas hundreds of lines of commented code create distractions and confusion (especially as the source files continue to evolve), and code that is never executed, gated by a flag that is always disabled, is a metaphorical time bomb waiting to explode, as painfully experienced by Knight Capital, for example (see \"Order In the Matter of Knight Capital Americas LLC\" [Sec13]). At the risk of sounding extreme, when you consider a web service that‚Äôs expected to be available 24/7, to some extent, every new line of code written is a liability. SRE promotes practices that make it more likely that all code has an essential purpose, such as scrutinizing code to make sure that it actually drives business goals, routinely removing dead code, and building bloat detection into all levels of testing. The \"Negative Lines of Code\" Metric The term \"software bloat\" was coined to describe the tendency of software to become slower and bigger over time as a result of a constant stream of additional features. While bloated software seems intuitively undesirable, its negative aspects become even more clear when considered from the SRE perspective: every line of code changed or added to a project creates the potential for introducing new defects and bugs. A smaller project is easier to understand, easier to test, and frequently has fewer defects. Bearing this perspective in mind, we should perhaps entertain reservations when we have the urge to add new features to a project. Some of the most satisfying coding I‚Äôve ever done was deleting thousands of lines of code at a time when it was no longer useful. Minimal APIs French poet Antoine de Saint Exupery wrote, \"perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer more to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away\" [Sai39]. This principle is also applicable to the design and construction of software. APIs are a particularly clear expression of why this rule should be followed. Writing clear, minimal APIs is an essential aspect of managing simplicity in a software system. The fewer methods and arguments we provide to consumers of the API, the easier that API will be to understand, and the more effort we can devote to making those methods as good as they can possibly be. Again, a recurring theme appears: the conscious decision to not take on certain problems allows us to focus on our core problem and make the solutions we explicitly set out to create substantially better. In software, less is more! A small, simple API is usually also a hallmark of a well-understood problem. Modularity Expanding outward from APIs and single binaries, many of the rules of thumb that apply to object-oriented programming also apply to the design of distributed systems. The ability to make changes to parts of the system in isolation is essential to creating a supportable system. Specifically, loose coupling between binaries, or between binaries and configuration, is a simplicity pattern that simultaneously promotes developer agility and system stability. If a bug is discovered in one program that is a component of a larger system, that bug can be fixed and pushed to production independent of the rest of the system. While the modularity that APIs offer may seem straightforward, it is not so apparent that the notion of modularity also extends to how changes to APIs are introduced. Just a single change to an API can force developers to rebuild their entire system and run the risk of introducing new bugs. Versioning APIs allows developers to continue to use the version that their system depends upon while they upgrade to a newer version in a safe and considered way. The release cadence can vary throughout a system, instead of requiring a full production push of the entire system every time a feature is added or improved. As a system grows more complex, the separation of responsibility between APIs and between binaries becomes increasingly important. This is a direct analogy to object-oriented class design: just as it is understood that it is poor practice to write a \"grab bag\" class that contains unrelated functions, it is also poor practice to create and put into production a \"util\" or \"misc\" binary. A well-designed distributed system consists of collaborators, each of which has a clear and well-scoped purpose. The concept of modularity also applies to data formats. One of the central strengths and design goals of Google‚Äôs protocol buffers40 was to create a wire format that was backward and forward compatible. Release Simplicity Simple releases are generally better than complicated releases. It is much easier to measure and understand the impact of a single change rather than a batch of changes released simultaneously. If we release 100 unrelated changes to a system at the same time and performance gets worse, understanding which changes impacted performance, and how they did so, will take considerable effort or additional instrumentation. If the release is performed in smaller batches, we can move faster with more confidence because each code change can be understood in isolation in the larger system. This approach to releases can be compared to gradient descent in machine learning, in which we find an optimum solution by taking small steps at a time, and considering if each change results in an improvement or degradation. A Simple Conclusion This chapter has repeated one theme over and over: software simplicity is a prerequisite to reliability. We are not being lazy when we consider how we might simplify each step of a given task. Instead, we are clarifying what it is we actually want to accomplish and how we might most easily do so. Every time we say \"no\" to a feature, we are not restricting innovation; we are keeping the environment uncluttered of distractions so that focus remains squarely on innovation, and real engineering can proceed. 38This is often true of complex systems in general; see [Per99] and [Coo00]. 39Coined by my former manager, Johan Anderson, around the time I became an SRE. 40Protocol buffers, also referred to as \"protobufs,\" are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

Fair enough. But others are throwing the baby out with the bathwater: it‚Äôs a little silly to read comment after comment saying that the advice in TFA must be bad because Google does dumb/bad stuff on the regular. Companies aren‚Äôt homogenous. Even misguided companies may employ people who can teach others important things. Boeing is a perfect example of this. I would absolutely read an article proposing principles of engineering reliability from a Boeing eng/QA greybeard. Even as the rest of the company spiraled due to horrible leadership and management practices, many people in engineering and quality control did their damnedest to keep those failures from causing even more harm and loss of life. Those people probably have very valuable lessons to share about how to maintain what quality you can in a deeply hostile environment. reply dangus 2 hours agoparentI don‚Äôt see any validity to the alleged hypocrisy. End users making that criticism are confusing the products with the reliability practices. reply Tao3300 1 hour agorootparentIndeed, allegations of hypocrisy are a class of ad hominem. They don't necessarily weigh in on the validity. It just... feels good? I guess? People LOVE to feel like they caught a hypocrite. It's probably in the Top 5 most sought after dopamine kicks. reply burakemir 10 hours agoprevWhile the text touches on many points I would immediately sign, the paragraph starting with \"Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their creations, ...\" is really out of place. The cause of complexity is not emotional attachment, these are decisions being made. The decision to add feature after feature and punt on maintenance for example is something that has little to do with emotions. There is a lot of agency that engineers, SWE and SRE alike have in shaping how things are. However there can be good reasons to abandon simplicity. The real trouble here is not psychology but that as a profession we are really bad at measuring and estimating the effective cost of maintenance. Part of that is considering measures to improve simplicity and maintainability as cost that comes without gain and somehow less important than features, and then just accept giant rewrite a few years later. A continuous portion of upkeep would likely be more economical and real engineering has always included an aspect of economy - cost vs benefit. IMHO the loaded accusation of emotional attachment might be rooted in an \"us vs them\" attitude (SRE vs software engineering) that should have no place in a sober discussion on the value of simplicity and it diminishes an otherwise great text. reply CraigJPerry 10 hours agoparent>> Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their creations, confrontations over large-scale purges of the source tree are not uncommon. Some might protest, \"What if we need that code later?\" > the paragraph starting with \"Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their creations, ...\" is really out of place. FWIW I‚Äôve definitely encountered developers clinging to things when the business context has completely changed. I totally recognise the scenario in the original text. reply burakemir 10 hours agorootparentSure, but if we argue that these values and principles should be applicable, then it should also be possible to make an argument why and not blame the irrationality on emotions. It seems more likely that bounded rationality is at play here, where different parties only know part of the picture (and fail to bring these together and find out what would be best globally.) reply philosopher1234 2 hours agorootparentI don‚Äôt follow why we shouldn‚Äôt blame the irrationality on emotions. Emotions are massively important, and people do irrational things because of them all the time. Why pretend that‚Äôs not true? reply kortilla 1 hour agorootparentYou‚Äôre assuming the conclusion. What may appear to be irrational emotional behavior can be completely rational under a different set of information. reply burakemir 2 hours agorootparentprevThe question is not whether emotions can cause people to be irrational. They can! Not every case of irrational behavior is caused by emotions though. And when we are making an argument that people are acting against their own interests, it may help to ponder what makes them do so. All the more when we are claiming principles and values that should be accepted by everyone. \"If you don't believe me you are acting irrational / it's because you are emotionally attached\" does not seem to be an attitude that gets closer to real causes in a discussion on how to best seek simplicity, but rather a recipe for avoiding discussion or a \"thought-terminating cliche.\" There must be a better argument for convincing people to let go of code / clean up etc. reply oooyay 4 hours agoparentprevI'm a SRE and I disagree too, though, I think you're giving SREs too much credit in the category of our hegemony for an \"us vs them\" debate. Maybe at Google SWEs having relationships with their code based is a well studied thing. It could also just be someone's opinion that managed it's way unchallenged into the book. That's to say, Google SRE wasn't the best or last iteration of SRE. I personally think systems evolve the way you describe because of a system of incentives. There are more incentives for features than there exist for refactor and non top priority defect fixes. This comes from the people who hold power to shape incentives and they often do so with conflicting priorities and superficial understandings of the existing incentive structure. I'd also like to say that it's my own personal theory that systemic issues can only be caused by systemic forces. Individual mindsets cannot be to blame then; if a mindset has become systemic (example: SWEs overly attached to code and features) then your next question should be \"why?\". There's a system that enforces that, and if you don't look beyond personal obsession then you'll never find it. reply burakemir 57 minutes agorootparentI like this way of saying it. I don't think anything here is well studied at all. It is not like we are all fishing in the dark but the organizational structures that determine the conditions in which software development and operations happen are not well understood. I found Herb Simon's writings and his concept of bounded rationality very lucid. When we shift from \"reliability\" to \"safety\" we also need to shift from the individual to the system. reply intelVISA 4 hours agoparentprev> Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their creations Because engineers are human beings who often form an emotional attachment to their job security It's understandably very unwise to admit that Very Complex Solution that cost A Lot Of Money was A Bad Thing reply ozim 2 hours agorootparentUnfortunately complex solution we have accumulated over time is usually because business did not want to spend a bit more up front to come up with cleaner solution. In the same way business is also very reluctant to spend time/money on cleaning up stuff. I never ever had to make up complex stuff on my own. It always happens on its own. reply scott_w 6 hours agoparentprevI think the examples the paragraph gives more than backs up the statement. I‚Äôve met people who comment out code instead of deleting it (luckily not in a long time!) and I feel the authors speak from experience here. reply burakemir 2 hours agorootparentCurious what examples do you see there. I don't doubt the experience. When I draw analogies of my past experiences to present situations, that does not mean that my past experiences are the best way to convince people of what is the right thing to do. I still need to do the hard work of pointing out what it is that is in the common interest and why eg deleting stuff and simplifying is good. In such a discussion it won't help me to say people who disagree with me are generally just emotional, does it? Even if I may have encountered people with such emotional reactions. reply arccy 10 hours agoparentprevBut people do get attached to their creations, they don't want their things deprecated/removed, since to them it may feel like their thing is thrown away or wasted work down the drain. While they may not obviously state it as such, it can be the underlying reason driving their arguments (e.g. sunk cost fallacy). reply burakemir 10 hours agorootparentMaybe this is also about the desire to create, which of course is also common in engineering. It does not contradict my argument that the cost of maintenance and operations is being ignored eg when one creates things all the time and never removes stuff. And it should be possible to measure or estimate that cost. reply mrbungie 4 hours agoparentprevI think that is being transparent with what actually happens in the real world (engineers, at least in part, being human and emotional in their decisions), rather than just talking about impossible ideals (engineers thinking about tradeoffs in a purely objective matter). NIH, CV based development, preference for shiny/new things and a myriad of other \"engineer/organizational diseases\" exist, you know. And there are even SaaS/PaaS/XaaS marketing teams exploiting such human qualities when making software sales. reply jimmySixDOF 9 hours agoparentprevWhen containers got going there was a phrase used in devops to think of servers as \"cattle not pets\" for just this reason. reply kortilla 54 minutes agorootparentNo, that had nothing to do with emotional attachment. It‚Äôs a short phrase to remind people that they can‚Äôt make each device special with one-off because it needs to be repeated/destroyed all of the time. Separately, cattle vs pets is much older than containers. It got popular with ephemeral EC2 instances when people were first forced to grapple with lifetimes of VMs measured in hours and the ability to scale massively as needed. reply XorNot 6 hours agorootparentprevI never took that as dealing with emotional attachment, it was just a shorthand to express that at any moment you would kill cattle so don't do things you can't easily replicate. reply elktown 12 hours agoprevJust remember that what google writes in these kind of things is not universal. It's written from their very unusual circumstances. You can certainly pick nuggets that are more universal than others but, like in many other instances, too much unnecessary work is spent trying to imitate Google and others when it's not really needed. And no, you won't turn into Google over night, you will have time to adapt if fortune hits you. Some things are not even necessarily good advice at all, but rather a product of incentives within Google (and perhaps most tech corps) rewarding the aesthetics of \"innovation\". reply fmbb 12 hours agoparentI read the whole text (granted, a bit quickly) looking for weird or unnecessary advice but I cannot see any. This is a great text about considerations everyone operating software services should take to heart. It applies regardless of if you deploy a monolith or several smaller servers. If you are only one developer, it might apply in a smaller context. reply elktown 11 hours agorootparent\"If you are only one developer\" suggests zero interests in being nuanced. To be clear, this linked specifically to simplicity which I'm certainly in favor of emphasizing the importance of. But IME the exact opposite happens when people try to imitate Google overall in a smaller setting, where instead too much resources are spent on meta-issues instead of the product being developed. reply zbentley 3 hours agorootparentI think you‚Äôre arguing with someone who isn‚Äôt here. Nobody is endorsing the practices in TFA ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs Google‚Äù/in order to be like Google. Sure, people elsewhere make those claims all the time, and they‚Äôre wrong, but that‚Äôs not in evidence here that I can see. The article does seem to come pretty close to universally applicable good ideas. Not because of where its author works, but because of the content. reply elktown 2 hours agorootparent> Nobody is endorsing the practices in TFA ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs Google‚Äù/in order to be like Google. Sure, people elsewhere make those claims all the time, and they‚Äôre wrong, but that‚Äôs not in evidence here that I can see. I disagree, I think we can see this time and time a again. YMMV I guess. It's an encouragement to be vigilant for over-engineering when you don't need it because you're not google. I'm not saying that the content is bad, it's a worthy read. Just don't get overeager like the OOP craze phase where would attempt to bend everything into a maze of design pattern because people took whatever books they read way too far. Most of the chapters have YAGNI parts for smaller settings, but it's still worth knowing about what the next steps are. reply nvarsj 9 hours agoparentprevEven within Google, this is not universal. I doubt the majority of SREs at Google have even read the \"Google SRE book\". On the other hand, the book has some nuggets that make it worth reading. But it should be treated as a collection of essays from some very senior SREs rather than a manual. reply elktown 8 hours agorootparent> On the other hand, the book has some nuggets that make it worth reading Definitely! Mostly just a word of caution to not get overeager hoping to apply this everywhere, because \"here be dragons\". reply gnuser 1 hour agoprevAt the last ‚Äúreal‚Äù job I tried to help implement this as part of and later the manager of the ops team. It‚Äôs a great start, but in that case management wanted the idea of devops/sre but didn‚Äôt actually support it, and it really was a shit show. If you have a bad CTO and leadership on the board level, no amount of re-tooling will paper over their lack of support for the real principles. reply wouldbecouldbe 1 hour agoprev\"Why don‚Äôt we gate the code with a flag instead of deleting it?\" These are all terrible suggestions. Source control systems make it easy to reverse changes, whereas hundreds of lines of commented code create distractions and confusion.\" In most cases to delete code would be a good idea, but to say that source control systems make reverting easier. After a few months most developers will have forgot about those lines and at times uncommenting code & explaining it explicitly might be a better way to preserve knowledge then to rely on digging through GIT. reply lloydatkinson 1 hour agoparentFirst time I‚Äôm hearing that feature flags and commented out code are the same thing. reply wouldbecouldbe 1 hour agorootparentI've seen it be a company culture thing where every discussion was resolved with we'll put it behind a config/flag. It's an easy way to avoid hard choices. It's probably something like that the author refers to. reply userbinator 12 hours agoprevA lot of preaching but bears little resemblance to what Google is actually doing in reality. IMHO those who actually understand what \"simplicity\" means in software are only those who have tried to do anything in highly-resource-constrained environments. reply hiAndrewQuinn 12 hours agoparentA taxonomy of what we mean when we talk about \"resource-constrained\" might be helpful for those seeking to gain this knowledge. Limited CPU, RAM, etc are the obvious contenders - but then there's also \"resource-constrained\" as in \"I'm the solo dev of this project and have 5 hours in a good week to work on it\", or \"this runs in a weird place without Internet that I only get access to twice a year\". I've been in all of these situations, sometimes multiple at the same time, and they've been great forcing functions to find new paths towards simplicity. reply davidcbc 2 hours agoparentprev> bears little resemblance to what Google is actually doing in reality What is Google doing in reality? reply gtirloni 3 hours agoparentprevYou also have to keep in mind the scope and timeline of where these principles apply. I'm sure someone would be able to apply them to their own work most of the time but if you look at a company as a whole, unless someone at the top is really pushing for global simplicity, things are pretty messy most of the time. I'm just saying this because Google might be doing this in little islands, not as a company strategy. I don't really know and can only guess from the outside. reply kryptonomist 10 hours agoprevGlad to see those valuable principles written, even if it seems we are heading in the complete opposite. At least we can try to apply them on our side business.

Just stating that does not really add to the conversation reply stackskipton 46 minutes agorootparentNot OP but I'll give my take because I mostly agree. Because Google lives in a world few of us do. I'm SRE/DevOps and our lives are nothing like Google SREs. We have almost zero control over software that is chucked our way. Any attempt to try and control them fails with management telling us \"Just fucking ship it\". Finally, something I realized after working with various FAANG SRE types, they don't understand what bad development practices look like, they can't imagine it. reply maximinus_thrax 3 hours agorootparentprevBecause is just useless. I mean seriously, what valuable insight does anyone get from that? It's some sort of truism wrapped in a word sandwich, ready for linkedin lunatics to pat themselves on the back sharing it. Do you feel you've gained something by reading it? Is this a valuable piece of intelligence which would guide your future decisions? Will you bring this to the team during an argument to push your agenda? This feels like the same type of 'feel good' content which people read and then feel like they did something productive. But I would argue that every piece of insight coming for a mega corp, valuable inside the mega corp is actually dangerous outside when people take it as dogma and try to apply it. SRE in general is something which IMHO of working in the industry for decades has poisoned the industry with half assed cargo cult implementations. But it has Google branding, so it must be valuable, hits hard for the fanboys and obviously can and should be applied in every company and every context. I also find it ironic to see 'Simplicity' touted from the same people who let Kubernetes lose in the wild, but that's a different story for a different time reply zbentley 3 hours agorootparentI‚Äôve honestly never worked on software in an environment where the advice in the article wasn‚Äôt important to keep in mind. Personal projects, single digit employee count startups, growth stage, ancient and slow moving Perl monolith shops ‚Ä¶ they all needed to keep the principles of simplicity, boringness (boring.tech is a great reiteration of this) and continually self-auditing to reduce inherited complexity in mind. Whether or not Google interprets this advice in a sane way or whether they actually follow it are separate issues, but I think the advice is timely and (at least in my experience) important for many people to hear, regardless of where it‚Äôs author works. reply zbentley 32 minutes agorootparentEr, not boring.tech; boringtechnology.club is what I meant. reply gtirloni 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's circular reasoning (\"it's useless because it's useless\").

Google (not GCP) deleted ten years of my data without warning or notification or remorse or recourse even though I was doing nothing illegal. Amazon would never do something like it.

    "title": "Facial Recognition Error Leads to Wrongful Shoplifting Accusation and Ban",
    "originLink": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-69055945",
    "originBody": "'I was misidentified as shoplifter by facial recognition tech' 20 hours ago By James Clayton, BBC Newsnight Share BBC Sara needed some chocolate - she had had one of those days - so wandered into a Home Bargains store. \"Within less than a minute, I'm approached by a store worker who comes up to me and says, 'You're a thief, you need to leave the store'.\" Sara - who wants to remain anonymous - was wrongly accused after being flagged by a facial-recognition system called Facewatch. She says after her bag was searched she was led out of the shop, and told she was banned from all stores using the technology. \"I was just crying and crying the entire journey home‚Ä¶ I thought, 'Oh, will my life be the same? I'm going to be looked at as a shoplifter when I've never stolen'.\" Facewatch later wrote to Sara and acknowledged it had made an error. Facewatch is used in numerous stores in the UK - including Budgens, Sports Direct and Costcutter - to identify shoplifters. The company declined to comment on Sara's case to the BBC, but did say its technology helped to prevent crime and protect frontline workers. Home Bargains, too, declined to comment. It's not just retailers who are turning to the technology. On a humid day in Bethnal Green, in east London, we joined the police as they positioned a modified white van on the high street. Cameras attached to its roof captured thousands of images of people's faces. If they matched people on a police watchlist, officers would speak to them and potentially arrest them. Unflattering references to the technology liken the process to a supermarket checkout - where your face becomes a bar code. A police facial-recognition van's cameras can capture thousands of images On the day we were filming, the Metropolitan Police said they made six arrests with the assistance of the tech. That included two people who breached the terms of their sexual-harm prevention orders, a man wanted for grievous bodily harm and a person wanted for the assault of a police officer. Lindsey Chiswick, director of intelligence for the Met, told the BBC the tech's speed was extremely helpful. \"It takes less than a second for the technology to create a biometric image of a person's face, assess it against the bespoke watchlist and automatically delete it when there is no match.\" The BBC spoke to several people approached by the police who confirmed that they had been correctly identified by the system - 192 arrests have been made so far this year as a result of it. But civil liberty groups are worried that its accuracy is yet to be fully established, and point to cases such as Shaun Thompson's. Mr Thompson, who works for youth-advocacy group Streetfathers, didn't think much of it when he walked by a white van near London Bridge in February. Within a few seconds, though, he was approached by police and told he was a wanted man. \"That's when I got a nudge on the shoulder, saying at that time I'm wanted\". Shaun Thompson says he was a victim of mistaken identity He was asked to give fingerprints and held for 20 minutes. He says he was let go only after handing over a copy of his passport. But it was a case of mistaken identity. \"It felt intrusive‚Ä¶ I was treated guilty until proven innocent,\" he says. The BBC understands the mistake might have been due to a family resemblance. The Metropolitan Police declined to comment. 'Digital line-up' Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, has filmed the police on numerous facial-recognition deployments. She was there the night Shaun Thompson was picked up by police. \"My experience, observing live facial recognition for many years, [is that] most members of the public don't really know what live facial recognition is,\" she says. She says that anyone's face who is scanned is effectively part of a digital police line-up. \"If they trigger a match alert, then the police will come in, possibly detain them and question them and ask them to prove their innocence.\" The use of facial recognition by the police is ramping up. Between 2020 and 2022 the Metropolitan Police used live facial recognition nine times. The following year the figure was 23. Already in 2024 it has been used 67 times, so the direction of travel is clear. Champions say that misidentifications are rare. The Metropolitan Police say that around one in every 33,000 people who walk by its cameras is misidentified. But the error count is much higher once someone is actually flagged. One in 40 alerts so far this year has been a false positive. Michael Birtwhistle, head of research at the Ada Lovelace Institute research group, believes the technology is so new that the laws have not yet caught up. \"I think it absolutely is a Wild West at the moment. That's what creates this legal uncertainty as to whether current uses are unlawful or not,\" he says. In Bethnal Green, although some people the BBC spoke to were worried about the use of the tech, a majority were supportive - if it helped to tackle crime. That leads to another question about the technology: will it help in the long run? As people get more used to seeing white vans parked on busy high streets, will people who know they are wanted by police simply get wise to the cameras and avoid them? Will shoplifters hide their faces? Ms Carlo says society needs to guard against facial recognition becoming normalised. \"Once the police can say this is OK, this is something that we can do routinely, why not put it into the fixed-camera networks?\" This is the dystopian future that civil-liberty campaigners are most afraid of - a China-style mass-surveillance state. Advocates dismiss such dire predictions as overblown. And it is also clear there are plenty among the public who are willing to put up with having their faces scanned - if it means safer streets.

Being evicted from a store is necessarily a public act. Telling someone wrongly that they are a thief, in public, seems like libel. Since most people go to stores in their neighbourhood, this could easily happen in front of your friends, neighbours, parents of other kids at your school, fellow members of social clubs or worship clubs, etc. If this happened to me, I'd be going and seeing if I could get any lawyers to take this on a no-win no fee basis. It seems like businesses are increasingly failing to think through what their process will look like to real human beings. reply Latty 9 hours agoparentWhen I worked on analysis software for police & intelligence agencies, it quickly became clear that no matter how much you present something with clear \"this is a heuristic, it can give you leads\", a scary number of people will take it as \"this will tell you whodunit\" and just assume it's infallible. If people are going to treat these things like they are forensic evidence and not lead generation, then they shouldn't be legal. Some precedent that people need to check these things before acting on them would be very good. reply kreyenborgi 8 hours agorootparentFrom The flaws of policies requiring human oversight of government algorithms https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026736492... : human oversight policies provide a false sense of security in adopting algorithms and enable vendors and agencies to shirk accountability for algorithmic harms. And the better The Algorithm is, the less people check, and the more of its faults pass through. Having worked on systems that required human oversight, I've seen first-hand, and analyzed data on, how people click the \"LGTM\" button without reflecting. We even noticed how when we improved our predictor with expert input, so that it performed better according to experts who worked with it, it would perform worse when we benchmarked on the previously \"manually checked\" data set. Analysis showed that the manual checks had let through so many of the algorithm's faults, that when the algorithm improved, it got a worse score. See also https://predictive-optimization.cs.princeton.edu/ : We present seven flaws of predictive optimization. Our aim is to outline a set of objections inherent to predictive optimization that cannot be easily fixed using a design or engineering change. Taken together, these critical flaws undermine the legitimacy of applications of predictive optimization. 1. Good predictions may not lead to good decisions 2. It's hard to measure what we truly care about 3. The training data rarely matches the deployment setting 4. Social outcomes aren‚Äôt accurately predictable, with or without machine learning 5. Disparate performance between groups can‚Äôt be fixed by algorithmic interventions 6. Providing adequate contestability undercuts putative efficiency benefits 7. Predictive optimization doesn't account for strategic behavior reply Latty 6 hours agorootparentTrue, \"check\" was poor phrasing, because these things don't produce evidence, they produce alerts to guide investigation. It should be a given that these systems don't produce anything actionable, they are a guide for a user to look more closely, of course, that requires someone in the chain stops and says \"this isn't usable evidence\". reply ajb 9 hours agorootparentprevVery interesting - thanks for giving us the benefit of your experience. In the case of store workers, it's not obvious what other checking they could do. The only reasonable use I can see is for them to keep an eye on the person that has been flagged. But I expect that the entire purpose of this tech is to reduce the number of store guards they need to pay, so they are likely not to have the manpower. If the policy is 'don't let them in the store', I don't see how a store worker can avoid making false accusations. reply namaria 8 hours agorootparentThere's something fundamentally wrong with these probabilistic analysis tools being sold currently as \"artificial intelligence\".

Certainly, more transparency than \"we bought some facial recognition software, no, you can't see the code, that's a trade secret\". reply mcherm 5 hours agorootparentprevI can think of one possible regulation that I think would produce the proper behavior incentives. Require that the system intentionally produce false positives (selected at random) at approximately the same rate as the true positives. This means that the users of the system will be aware that any indication has only a 50% chance of being \"real\", and therefore can be used as an indicator to increase caution but NOT on it's own as a signal of guilt. reply exe34 40 minutes agorootparentWhy not just flip a coin then?

I certainly don't trust that the people purchasing these machines won't communicate to their staff that it's a flawless whodonit machine. That's because the step from \"potential leads\" to \"flawless machine\" is a relatively small leap easily hidden by throwing out bad stats and case studies about people caught red handed. Even if you say the machine is 80% accurate, a lot of people will happily accept harming the 20% on the chance they might be in the 80%. (Though, I'm willing to bet the false identification percentages are both not public and not kept up to date, if they are even known). reply btasker 9 hours agoparentprev> Telling someone wrongly that they are a thief, in public, seems like libel Slander. Libel is published, Slander is spoken. If they put a picture of her on a sheet that said \"shoplifter\" and posted in on the wall (or the net), it'd be libel. But, I don't think you'd win a case based on Slander either: * you'd still need to show it was published to a third party (though as you say, maybe you had friends present) * They can show that they reasonably believed it to be true (the system told them so). Their wording then becomes incredibly important - did they say \"you're a shoplifter\" or \"you've been identified by our shoplifter recognition system\" They might also try to argue that stopping shoplifting is in the public interest and that this was a statement of opinion related tot hat. I agree though, if this happened to me, I'd definitely be sending a letter or two to dissuade them from making a similar mistake in future (I think I'd also be trying my luck with Facewatch given that their system disseminated that \"information\") reply ajb 8 hours agorootparentYes, I'd forgotten that libel is published information. Although, given that this is third party tech, maybe Facewatch counts as the publisher. reply davidhbolton 6 hours agorootparentWouldn't there be a better outcome for those misidentified and publicly slandered and inconvenienced if they sued for stress?

Why not have a standard generous payout to anyone misidentified by the system. The payout would be funded by all parties involved, store, police, tech company. If the benefits really do outweigh the harms and the compensation is enough, I think most people would begin welcoming the program. If the system got gamed (people with a history of false positives seeking to be misidentified), fine, it would encourage the technology to improve and eliminate false positives. reply thfuran 7 hours agorootparentThe payout would have to be at least enough to both fund and cover the inconvenience of moving to a new neighborhood closer to stores you aren't yet banned from. Of course, that becomes impossible if the tech is widespread enough. reply calewis 6 hours agoparentprevIt doesn‚Äôt really work like that in the UK.

She‚Äôs not been named publicly, no lost earnings etc. I would like to think this sort of thing means we get better regulation, but who am I kidding. reply krisoft 8 hours agoprevI understand that my viewpoint differs from that of many here. I don‚Äôt see the problem with the live face detection. What I see as a problem is the process followed after the detection. Simply saying with any system like this there will be mistakes. The reaction should be designed such that we account for these mistakes. It sounds like the system as designed has at least three unhandled exceptions: - your system thinks I am someone who stole something but I am not that someone. (Mis-identification) - your system thinks I am someone who stole something, and I am that someone but I did not stole anything ever. (Mistake in the database) - your system thinks I am some who stole something, and I did, but I have already been properly punished for it. (Rehabilitation) If you just bar people from the shop automatically on a positive identification you are going to make the above mistakes on a massive scale. And because of the nature of these system if they made a mistake once with someone it is possible they will make the mistake again and again, so you better handle the exceptions in a gracefull and sensible maner. And shops will absolutely not do the right thing on their own. Because it is just so much cheaper to hassle the few who has fallen off from the happy path than build in the proper safeguards, so shops on their own will just decide to ‚Äúeat‚Äù the losses caused by persecuting innocents. And that is the part which is not right. That is where laws should come in and mandate proper procedural safeguards. What are the proper safeguards? I don‚Äôt know. I have ideas on how that could go, but this comment is already getting very long. What I am saying is that I think the correct solution is not ‚Äúno cctv with facial detection allowed‚Äù as many here seems to propose, but it is also not letting shops persecute innocent victims of the above exceptions. There is a third way with regulated and safeguarded procedures where I think we should be looking. reply bcrosby95 4 hours agoparentAin't no one gonna use the tech if they have to spend 30 minutes doing a background check after it flags someone. I also guarantee this is not how sales and marketing are pitching it. reply pc86 6 hours agoparentprevStrictly to your point about rehabilitation, that doesn't mean the store necessarily needs to let you shop there again. So unless there is a statutory requirement to the contrary stores would still get that information and presumably there would be a chain-specific SOP about whether or not that person was allowed on the property. reply lkramer 6 hours agorootparentThat is perhaps reasonable if it's one store, or even a chain, but the article spoke about this applying across multiple chains, whichever used this software. If we end up banning people for life from shopping in physical sto ed because they shoplifted once when they were young, we are creating a deeply disturbing society. reply lsaferite 6 hours agorootparentprevI think the danger in systems like this is in the article. They said the shopper was banned from all establishments running that system. So, even if the accused person is not accused of doing anything in that particular establishment, they are now capable of being globally banned. That should 100% be prohibited. reply data-ottawa 7 hours agoparentprevI'm guessing unless you go to the press these issues will never get resolved for you and you'll just be banned from random stores.

I spent 7 years as lead developer of one of the globally leading FR systems, and I've left the industry. It is fundamentally unsafe in the hands of ordinary people, ordinary people who are not scientifically and rationally discriminate in their day to day activities. Ordinary people treat FR like an AI Gawd, and the police are hopeless with it. The straw that broke my camel's back was learning of the wide spread practice of police asking crime victims \"what celebrity does the perpetrator look the most alike?\" And then the police would put that celebrity's photo into their FR system and start harassing people in their city that look like the celebrity. So, mind numbingly stupid, I got angry at clients doing this, got barred from talking to clients, and soon there after quit the industry. The industry believes it is \"not their problem\". reply EnigmaFlare 8 hours agoparentprevMaybe a solution is the cost of lawsuits from false positives vs the cost of theft from false negatives means shopkeepers or their insurance companies have to make a reasonable trade-off in how they use that information that keeps most people happy.

I remember being taken aback by the amount of street CCTV cameras back in the early '00s.

The vast, vast majority of CCTV systems in the UK, that are part of this ‚Äúculture‚Äù, are just store and private CCTV systems that police can get access to with a warrant, by going door to door. The same as in almost all western countries. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance_in_the_Unite... There‚Äôs almost no police CCTV network, and there‚Äôs no reality to the fantasy element of police being able to see you wherever you go in the UK in real time (with the exception of a few crowded high crime areas where tourists get robbed, ironically, and a few high violence and terrorism risk areas, public transport facilities and live road traffic cameras). There are some council-owned networks in high crime areas which are pretty contentious, and then there are these police facial recognition vans which are clearly offensive bullshit overreach. In particular a lot of visitors misunderstand the prevalence of cameras pointed at our roads, which are not live feed cameras at all but speed-triggered safety cameras. Basically it‚Äôs important to understand that the vast majority of cameras in the UK are people and businesses legally protecting their own shit, just like in the USA. One key cultural difference is ANPR. In America the general perception is that privacy includes where you go in your car, because you treat it as a portable living room. There‚Äôs never been that presumption here. ANPR systems probably can track cars in metropolitan areas and on some motorways, but live traffic cameras are unusual in most of the country. There is definitely a slightly less self-centred lean to the balance of individual rights compared to community safety compared to North America. But this is also part of why we don‚Äôt have to put up with anywhere near the same risk of violence or crime, even in areas that are significantly more densely populated.

Or a shopkeeper denying entry to a customer based on the likeness to a list of mugshots held under the counter. Those are faillible processes too.

But even a 99.9% or 100% confidence might be wrong so this isn't even an 80% chance - at best it's 80% times the statistical likelihood of this not being a false positive at 100% confidence, and that can never be a 100% chance.

This should apply even to past criminals. Such laws protect against racism and other forms of discrimination, and they help integrate convicts back into society, at the cost of \"commercial freedom\".

TFA says that it has a failure rate of 1:33,000. That's a \"do not ship\" rating for almost anything else. > immediately stopping you the only thing you have to do is pull out your ID? Someone I know was detained on the side of the M25 for an hour sorting things out after being pulled over. He presented the police with his ID and they decided it was a fake. His name was almost identical to someone who was wanted - his middle name and date-of-birth were different. The Police said that was common on fake IDs - just change a few small bits of information - and that they'd have to take him to the station where he could sort it. The only reason he didn't get taken in in the end is because the description of the wanted person noted that he had tattoos on his chest. On the side of the M25, at night, the only thing that stopped my mate being hauled into a London police station was taking his top off. Anecdotes don't make data, but the idea that a copper will simply accept ID despite a system saying \"this is your guy\" is incredibly naive and suggests you've not had to interact with them much. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparent> suggests you've not had to interact with them much.

Ah, that explains a point that I'd didn't bother to pull you up on. Carrying ID is not a routine thing here in the way that it is in some other countries (there have previously been attempts to introduce a national ID but they were staunchly opposed). So, it's not a given that you'll have ID on you to show them. Drivers probably have their driving license in their wallet, but even that's not guaranteed (because you don't have to have it on you when driving). The \"quality\" of police varies by force (and, of course, by officer). The Met, though, have had some pretty serious issues with misconduct (including sexual assault and murder) and are still working through the processes of identifying personnel who shouldn't be in uniform at all (the Met themselves found there were hundreds of officers who should have been sacked previously). They're working to fix things (or claim to be), but you probably don't want a force that's been described as \"institutionally racist, sexist and homophobic\" to be entrusted with something like this. > For anything where failure means death, sure.

She got out off Tesco as quick as she could.

    "title": "SpinRite's Diminished Relevance in the Era of SSDs and Advanced HDDs",
    "originLink": "https://computer.rip/2024-05-25-grc-spinrite.html",
    "originBody": ">>> 2024-05-25 grc spinrite (PDF) I feel like I used to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with suspect hard drives. I mean, like, back in high school. These days I almost never do, or on the occasion that I have storage trouble, it's a drive that has completely stopped responding at all and there's little to do besides replacing it. One time I had two NVMe drives in two different machines do this to me the same week. Bad luck or quantum phenomenon, who knows. What accounts for the paucity of \"HDD recovery\" in my adult years? Well, for one, no doubt HDD technology has improved over time and modern drives are simply more reliable. The well-aged HDDs I have running without trouble in multiple machines right now support this theory. But probably a bigger factor is my buying habits: back in high school I was probably getting most of the HDDs I used second-hand from the Free Geek thrift store. They were coming pre-populated with problems for my convenience. Besides, the whole storage industry has changed. What's probably more surprising about my situation is how many \"spinning rust\" HDDs I still own. Conventional magnetic storage only really makes sense in volume. These days I would call an 8TB HDD a small one. The drives that get physical abuse, say in laptops, are all solid state. And solid state drives... while there is no doubt performance degradation over their lifetimes, failure modes tend to be all-or-nothing. I was thinking about all of this as I ruminated on one of the \"holy grail\" tools of the late '00s: SpinRite, by Gibson Research Corporation. The notion that HDDs aren't losing data like they used to is supported by the dearth of data recovery tools on the modern shareware market. Well, maybe that's more symptomatic of the complete hollowing out of the independent software industry by the interests of capitalism, but let's try to dwell on the positive. Some SEO-spam blog post titled \"Best data recovery software of 2024\" still offers some classic software names like \"UnDeleteMyFiles Pro,\" but some items on the list are just backup tools, and options like Piriform Recuva and the open-source PhotoRec still rank prominently... as they did when I was in high school and my ongoing affection for Linkin Park was less embarrassing [1]. Back in The Day, freeware, shareware, and commercial (payware?) data recovery software proliferated. It was advertised in the back of magazines, the sidebar banner ads of websites, and even appeared in the electronics department of Fred Meyer's. You also saw a lot of advertisements for services that could perform more intensive methods, like swapping an HDD's controller for one from another unit of the same model. These are all still around today, just a whole lot less prominent. Have you ever seen an Instagram ad for UnDeleteMyFiles Pro? First, we should talk a bit about the idea of data recovery in general. There are essentially two distinct fields that we might call \"data recovery\": consumers or business users trying to recover their Important Files (say, accounting spreadsheets) from damaged or failed devices, and forensic analysts trying to recover Important Files (say, the other accounting spreadsheets) that have been deleted. There is naturally some overlap between these two ventures. Consumers sometimes accidentally delete their Important Files and want them back. Suspects sometimes intentionally damage storage devices to complicate forensics. But the two different fields use rather different techniques. Let's start by examining forensics, both to set up contrast to consumer data recovery and because I know a lot more about it. One of the quintessential techniques of file system forensics is \"file carving.\" A file carving tool examines an arbitrary sequence of bytes (say, from a disk image) and looks for the telltale signs of known file formats. For example, most common file formats have a fixed prefix of some kind. ZIP files start with 0x504B0304, the beginning of which is the ASCII \"PK\" for Phil Katz who designed the format. Some formats also have a fixed trailer, but many more have structure that can be used to infer the location of the end of the file. For example, in ZIP files the main header structure, the \"central directory,\" is actually a trailer found at the end of the file. If you can find the beginning and end of a file, and it's stored sequentially, you've now got the whole file. When the file is fragmented in the byte stream (commonly the case with disk images), the problem is a little tougher, but still you can find a lot of value. A surprising number of files are stored sequentially because they are small, some filetypes have internal structure that can be used to infer related blocks and their order, and even finding a single block of a file can be useful if it happens to contain a spreadsheet row starting \"facilitating payments to foreign officials\" or, I don't know, \"Fiat@\". You end up doing this kind of thing a lot because of a detail of file systems that all of my readers probably know. It's often articulated as something like \"when you delete a file, it's not deleted, just marked as having been deleted.\" That's not exactly wrong but it's also an oversimplification in a way that makes it more difficult to understand why that is the case. There's a whole level of indirection due to block allocation, updating the bitmap on every file delete is a relatively time-consuming process that offers little value, actually overwriting blocks would be even more time consuming with even less value, etc. Read Brian Carrier for the whole story. Actually, screw Brian Carrier, I've written before about the adjacent topic of secure erasure of computer media. My point is this: these forensic methods are performed on a fully functional storage device (or more likely an image of one), where \"recovery\" is necessary and possible because of the design of the file system. The storage device, as hardware, is not all that involved. Well, that's really an oversimplification, and points to an important consideration in modern data recovery: storage devices have gotten tremendously more complex, and that's especially true of SSDs. Even HDDs tend to have their own thoughts and feelings. They can have a great deal of internal logic dedicated to maintaining the disk surface, optimizing performance, working around physical defects on the surface, caching, encryption, etc. Pretty much all of this is proprietary to the manufacturer, undocumented, and largely a mystery to the person performing recovery. Thinking of the device as a \"sequence of bytes\" throws out a lot of what's really going on, but it's a necessary compromise. SSDs have gone even further. Flash storage is less durable than magnetic storage but also more flexible. It requires new optimizations to maximize life and facilitates optimizations for access time and speed. Some models of SSDs vary from each other only by their software configuration (this has long been suspected of some HDDs as well, but I have no particular insight into Western Digital color coding). Even worse for the forensic analyst, the TRIM command creates a whole new level of active management by the storage device: SSDs know which blocks are in use, allowing them to constantly remap blocks on the fly. It is impossible, without hardware reverse engineering techniques, to produce a true image of an SSD. You are always working with a \"view\" of the SSD mediated by its firmware. So let's compare and contrast forensic analysis to consumer data recovery. The problem for most consumers is sort of the opposite: they didn't delete the file. If they could get the sequence of bytes off the storage device, they could just access the file through the file system. The problem is that the storage device is refusing to produce bytes at all, or it's producing the wrong ones. Techniques like file carving are not entirely irrelevant to consumer data recovery because it's common for storage devices to fail only partially. There are different ways of referring to the physical geometry of HDDs, and besides, modern storage devices (HDDs and SSDs alike) abstract away their true geometry. Different file systems also use different terminology for their own internal system of mapping portions of the drive to logical objects. So while you'll find people say things like \"bad cluster\" and \"bad sector,\" I'm just going to talk about blocks. The block is the smallest elementary unit by which your file system interacts with the device. The size of a block is typically 512B for smaller devices and 4k for larger devices. A common failure mode for storage devices (although, it seems, not so much today) is the loss of a specific block: the platter is damaged, or some of the flash silicon fails, and a specific spot just won't read any more. The storage device can, and likely will, paper over this problem by moving the block to a different area in the storage medium. But, in the process, the contents of the block are probably lost. The new location just contains... whatever was there before [2]. Sometimes the bad block is in the middle of a file, and that sucks for that file. Sometimes the bad block is in the middle of a file system structure like the allocation table, and that sucks for all of the files. More complicated file systems tend to incorporate precautionary measures against this kind of thing, so the blast radius is mostly limited to single files. For example, NTFS keeps a second copy of the allocation table as a backup. Journaling can also provide a second source of allocation data when the table is damaged. Simpler file systems, like the venerable FAT, don't have any of these tricks. They are, after all, old and simple. But old age and simplicity gives FAT a \"lowest common denominator\" status that sees it widely used on removable devices. PhotoRec, while oriented towards the consumer data recovery application, is actually a file carving tool. It's no coincidence that it's called PhotoRec. Removable flash devices like SD cards have simple controllers and host simple file systems. They are, as a result, some of the most vulnerable devices to block failures that render intact files undiscoverable. What about the cases where file isn't intact, though? Where the block that has become damaged is part of the file that we want? What about cases where a damaged head leaves an HDD unable to read an entire surface? Well, the news isn't that great. Despite this being one of the most common types of consumer storage failure for a decade or more, and despite the enormous inventory of software that promises to help, your options are limited. A lot of the techniques that software packages used in these situations lack supporting research or are outright suspect. Let's start on solid ground, though, with the most obvious and probably safest option. One of the problems you quickly encounter when working with a damaged storage device is the file system and operating system. File systems don't like damaged storage devices, and operating systems don't like file systems that refuse to give up a file they say exists. So you try to copy files off of the bad device and onto a good one using your daily-driver file browser, and it hits a block that won't read and gets stuck. Maybe it hangs almost indefinitely, maybe you get an obscure error and the copy operation stops. Your software is working against you. One of the best options for data recovery from suspect devices is an open-source tool called ddrescue. ddrescue is very simple and substantially similar to dd. It has one critical trick up its sleeve: when reading a block fails, ddrescue retries a limited number of times and then moves on. With that little adaptation, you can recover all of the working blocks from a device and so likely recover all of the files but a few. Besides, just retrying a few times has value. Especially on magnetic devices, the result of reading the surface can be influenced by small perturbances. An unreadable sector might be readable every once in a while. This doesn't seem to happen as much with SSDs due to the dynamics of flash storage and preemptive correction of weak or ambiguous values, but I'm sure it still happens every once in a while. At the end of the day, though, this method still means accepting the loss of some data. Losing some data is better than losing all of it, but it might not be good enough. Isn't there anything we can do? HDDs used to be different. For one, they used to be bigger. But there's more to it than that. Older hard drives used stepper motors to position the head stack, and so head positioning was absolute but subject to some mechanical error. Although this was rarely the case on the consumer market, early hard drives were sometimes sold entirely uninitialized, without the timing marks the controller used to determine sector positions. You had to use a special tool to get the drive to write them [3]. It was common for older drives to come with a report (often printed on the label) of known bad sectors to be kept in mind when formatting. We now live in a different era. Head stacks are positioned by a magnetic coil based on servo feedback from the read head; mechanical error is virtually absent and positioning is no longer absolute but relative to the cylinder being read. Extensive low-level formatting is required but is handled completely internally by the controller. Controllers passively detect bad blocks and reallocate around them. Honestly, there's just not a lot you can do. There are too many levels of abstraction between even the ATA interface and the actual storage to do anything meaningful at the level of the magnetic surface. And all of this was pretty much true in the late '00s, even before SSDs took over. So what about SpinRite? SpinRite dates back to 1987 and is apparently still under development by its creator Steve Gibson. Gibson is an interesting figure, one of the \"Tech Personalities\" that contemporary media no longer creates (insert comment about decay in the interest of capitalism here). Think Robert Cringely or Leo Laporte, with whom Gibson happens to cohost a podcast. In my mind, Gibson is perhaps most notable for his work as an early security researcher, which had its misses but also had its hits. Through the whole thing he's run Gibson Research Corporation. GRC offers a variety of one-off web services, like a password generator (generated, erm, server-side) and something that displays the TLS fingerprint of a website you enter. There's a user-triggered port scanner called ShieldsUp, which might be interesting were it not for the fact that its port list seems limited to the Windows RPC mapper and some items of that type... things that were major concerns in the early '00s but rarely a practical problem today. It's full of some gems. Consider the password generator... What makes these perfect and safe? Every one is completely random (maximum entropy) without any pattern, and the cryptographically-strong pseudo random number generator we use guarantees that no similar strings will ever be produced again. Also, because this page will only allow itself to be displayed over a snoop-proof and proxy-proof high-security SSL connection, and it is marked as having expired back in 1999, this page which was custom generated just now for you will not be cached or visible to anyone else. ... The \"Techie Details\" section at the end describes exactly how these super-strong maximum-entropy passwords are generated (to satisfy the uber-geek inside you). You know I'm reading the Techie Details. They describe a straightforward approach using AES in CBC mode, fed by a counter and its own output. It's unremarkable except that just about any modern security professional would have paroxysms at the fact that he seems to have implemented it himself. Sure, there are better methods (like AES CTR), but this is the kind of thing where you shouldn't even really be using methods. \"I read it from /dev/urandom\" is a far more reassuring explanation than a block diagram of cryptographic primitives. /dev/urandom is a well-audited implementation, whatever is behind your block diagram is not. Besides, it's server side! My point is not so much to criticize Gibson's technical expertise, although I certainly think you could, but to say that he doesn't seem to have updated his website in some time. A lot of little details like references to WEP and the fact that the PDFs are Corel Ventura output support this theory. By association, I suspect that GRC's flagship product, SpinRite, doesn't get a lot of active maintenance either. Even back around 2007 when I first encountered SpinRite it was already a little questionable, and I remember a rough internet consensus of \"it likely doesn't do anything but it probably doesn't hurt to try.\" A little research finds that \"is SpinRite snake oil?\" threads date back to the Usenet era. It doesn't help that Steve Gibson's writing is pervaded by a certain sort of... hucksterism. A sort of ceaseless self-promotion that internet users associate mostly with travel influencers selling courses about how to make money as a travel influencer. But what does SpinRite even claim? After a charming disclaimer that GRC is opposed to software patents but nonetheless involved in \"extensive ongoing patent acquisition\" related to SpinRite, a document titled \"SpinRite: What's Under the Hood\" gives some details. It's undated but has metadata pointing at 1998. That's rather vintage I see several reasons to think that there have been few or no functional changes in SpinRite since that time. SpinRite is a bootable tool based on FreeDOS. It originated as an interleaving tool, which I won't really explain because it's quite irrelevant to modern storage devices and really just a historic detail of SpinRite. It also \"introduc[ed] the concept of non-destructive low-level reformatting,\" which I won't really explain because I don't know what it means, other than it seems to fall into the broad category of no one really knowing what \"low level formatting\" means. It's a particularly amusing example, because most modern software vendors use \"low level formatting\" to refer explicitly to a destructive process. SpinRite \"completely bypasses the system's motherboard BIOS software when used on any standard hard disk system.\" I assume this means that SpinRite directly issues ATA commands, which probably has some advantages, although the specific ones the document calls out seem specious. In reference to SpinRite's data recovery features, we read that \"The DynaStat system's statistical analysis capability frequently determines a sector's correct data even when the data could never be read correctly from the mass storage medium.\" This is what I remember as the key claim of SpinRite marketing over a decade ago: that SpinRite would attempt rereading a block a very large number of times and then determine on a bit-by-bit basis what the most likely value is. It seems reasonable on the surface, but it wouldn't make much sense with a drive with internal error correction. That's universal today but I'm not sure how long that's been true, presumably in the late '90s this was a better idea. That's probably the high point of this document's credibility. Everything from there gets more suspect. It claims that SpinRite has a proprietary system that models the internal line coding used by \"every existing proprietary\" hard drive, an unlikely claim in 1998 and an impossible one today without a massive reverse engineering effort. Consider also \"its second recovery strategy of deliberately wiggling the drive's heads.\" It seems to achieve this by issuing reads to cylinders on either side of the cylinder in question, but it's questionable if that would even work in principle on a modern drive. You must then consider the use of servo positioning on modern drives, which means that the head will likely oscillate around the target cylinder before settling on it anyway. This gives the flavor of the central problem with SpinRite: it claims to perform sophisticated analysis at a very low level of the drive's operation, but it claims to do that with hard drives that intentionally abstract away all of their low level details. A lot of the document reads, to modern eyes, like pure flimflam, written by someone who knew enough about HDDs to sound technical but not enough to really understand the implications of what they were saying. The thing is, though, this document is from '98 and the software was already a decade old at the time! The document does note that SpinRite 3.0 was a complete rewrite, but I suspect it was the last complete rewrite and probably carried a lot of its functionality over from the first two versions. I think that SpinRite probably does implement the functionality that it claims and that those features might have been of some value in the late '80s and much of the '90s. Then technology moved on and SpinRite became irrelevant. Probably the only thing that SpinRite does of any value on a modern drive is just rewriting the entire addressable area, which gives the controller an opportunity to detect bad blocks and remap them. That should also happen in the course of normal operation, though, and even tools dedicated to that purpose (like the open-source badblocks) are becoming rather questionable in comparison to the preemptive capabilities of modern HDDs. This type of bad-block-detecting rewrite pass is probably only useful in pathological cases on older devices, but it's also the only real claim of the vast majority of modern \"hard drive repair\" software. It seems a little mean-spirited to go after GRC for their old software, but they continue to promote it at a cost of $89. The FAQ tells us that \"SpinRite is every bit as necessary today as it ever was ‚Äî maybe even more so since people store so much valuable personal 'media' data on today's massive drives.\" I resent the implication of the scare-quoted \"media,\" Mr. Gibson, but what I do with my hard drives in my own home is none of your business. The FAQ tells us \"SpinRite is often credited with performing \"true miracles\" of data recovery,\" but is oddly silent on the topic of SSDs. Some dedicated Wikipedia editor rounded up a number of occasions on which Gibson said that SpinRite was of limited or no use with SSDs, and yet the GRC website currently includes the heading \"Amazingly effective for SSDs!\" There is no technical explanation offered for how SpinRite's exceptionally platter-centric features affect an SSD, nor mention of any new functionality targeting flash storage. Instead, there's just anecdotal claims that SpinRite made SSDs faster and a suggestion that the reader google a well-known behavior of flash storage for which SSD controllers have considerable mitigations. It is an odd detail of the GRC website that most of the new information about the product is provided in the form of video. Specifically, videos excerpted from recent episodes of Gibson and Laporte's podcast \"Security Now.\" Security Now is weekly, so I don't think that SpinRite promotional material makes up a large portion of it, but it does seem conspicuous that Gibson uses the podcast as a platform for 15 minute stories about how SpinRite worked miracles. These segments, and their mentions of how SpinRite is a very powerful tool that one shouldn't run on SSDs too often, absolutely reek of the promotional techniques behind Orgone accumulators, Hulda Clark's \"Zapper,\" and color therapy. It is, it seems, quack medicine for the hard drive. I don't think SpinRite started as a scam, but I sure think it ended as one. A lot of this was already apparent back in the late '00s, and I can't honestly say that bootleg copies of SpinRite every improved anything for me. So why did I love it so much? The animations! SpinRite's TUI was truly a work of art. Just watch it go!. [1] I recently bought the 20th anniversary vinyl box set of Meteora, which emphasizes that (1) 20 years have passed and (2) I am still a loser. [2] This kind of visible failure seems uncommon with SSDs, likely because SSD controllers tend to read out the flash in a critical, suspicious way and take preemptive action when the physical state is less than perfectly clear cut. In a common type of engineering irony, the fact that flash storage is less reliable than magnetic media requires aggressive management of the problem that makes the overall system more reliable. Or at least that's what I tell myself when another SSD has gone completely unresponsive. [3] Honestly this doesn't seem to have been typical with any hard drives by the microcomputer era, which makes perfect sense if you consider that these hard drives were sold with bad sector lists and therefore must have been factory tested. The whole \"low level formatting\" thing has been 70% a scam and 30% confusion with the very different technical tradition of magnetic diskettes, since probably 1990 at least.",

But still I have no idea whether or not it was legit info...? reply mindslight 19 minutes agoparentMy recollection of his networking utilities is similar. The raw sockets thing was obvious nonsense and demonstrated a fundamental inability to understand security (software/capabilities of remote parties are completely independent from your local environment - removing a feature from Windows that can facilitate attacks would not affect Windows's defensive vulnerabilities!). You'd meet plenty of types of these people in the 90's/00's, possessing security \"certifications\" but no actual mental model of how anything worked. I once had to suffer a university head of IT who was scared of individuals running Linux connected to the campus network because \"there was no company to sue\". Gibson's whole schtick felt like a snake oil salesman that got a cult following of a bunch of Windows noobs that found his simple utilities useful (perhaps SpinRite was one of these) and then extrapolated from that into believing the vacuous technobabble marketing. In the circles I ran in, \"Gibson\" and \"Shields Up!\" were more punchlines for jokes than anything else. The concurrent \"Hack the Gibson\" meme didn't help that either.

It would be more convincing if there were experiments testing the claimed benefits of using SpinRite, specifically around performance improvements caused by running a scan. Personally I think the claimed data recovery capabilities of SpinRite are less relevant these days due to file systems like ZFS that have scrubbing and data recovery built in. Distributed block and blob storage systems that clouds are built on have similar systems as well. I'd like to recommend Security Now, the podcast the the author of SpinRite, Steve Gibson, hosts. While at times Steve has a non-consensus take on things (other commenters have noted his preference for out-of-support versions of Windows), he is pretty good at explaining the technical details about the topics he covers. It's a good way to keep up with security news. Probably only the Security, Cryptography, Whatever podcast is better (more in-depth discussions of low level topics with experts), but it less consistently published. reply KennyBlanken 10 hours agoparentWhen someone makes extraordinary claims, it is their responsibility to prove those claims, not for others to disprove them. Further: there are numerous people who worked in the hard drive industry who say he's spouting bullshit with Spinrite. ZFS scrubbing is designed to counter issues that crop up with bit flips caused by extremely unlikely hardware errors and things like cosmic rays - which are extremely rare, but when you have petabyte scale storage, they actually become plausible risks. It has nothing to do with \"refreshing\" the data on-disk like Gibson claims, and it is only possible because it uses two layers of checksums to detect such bit-flips, comparing the file's checksum with the parity data used in the stripe (or the mirror.) That checksumming is integral to the filesystem. Spinrite doesn't have any similar function. It couldn't possibly \"correct\" data on a drive. The fact that you don't understand the difference between what amounts to a very dressed-up bad-block scan and ZFS scrubbing shows how under-qualified you are to be forming opinions on these subjects.

Scrubbing has multiple purposes. Sure cosmic rays, but it also helps detect poor cabling (if somehow that didn't throw checksum errors in regular use), wild writes and degrading media. Reading every sector with filesystem data is similar to a function of SpinRite that seems to read all sectors. Of course, SpinRite won't know if a good read holds bad data. But ZFS scrub doesn't read all sectors. According to claims, it sounds like SpinRite could issue uncorrected reads to a weak sector multiple times, run statistics and guess at the right value and write it back? That seems possibly useful, especially if the drive is likely to reallocate the sector when it's written to. Issuing writes to all sectors of a spinning disk can help the drive firmware with reallocating problematic sectors, although there's free tools to do that. reply MarkSweep 4 hours agorootparentprev> The fact that you don't understand the difference between what amounts to a very dressed-up bad-block scan and ZFS scrubbing shows how under-qualified you are to be forming opinions on these subjects.

A sort of ceaseless self-promotion that internet users associate mostly with travel influencers selling courses about how to make money as a travel influencer.\" Or substantive critical points about the software, e.g.: \"This gives the flavor of the central problem with SpinRite: it claims to perform sophisticated analysis at a very low level of the drive's operation, but it claims to do that with hard drives that intentionally abstract away all of their low level details.\" And I think it's fair to ask someone who is selling a piece of software for $89 to provide some backing for their claims beyond ones that would only pertain to largely-obsolete hardware. reply at_a_remove 13 hours agorootparentI think you are dead on.

[0]https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual... reply KennyBlanken 10 hours agoparentprevMy issue with Steve Gibson is that he spews technobabble, exploiting the delta between \"stuff people who work at drive manufacturers know\" and \"stuff computer users, even highly educated ones, know about how hard drives work\", in order to sell what basically amounts to a commercial version of badblocks with a bunch of fancy graphical animations. Spinrite kinda worked back in the days of MFM drives where they had to be low-level formatted with sector track information the controller then uses to figure out where the head is on the drive, and that sector information is refreshed during writes. But it was still quasi-snake oil, using a lot of mumbojumbo to say \"I just note the original value of a sector, write it a zillion times, and then move to the next. This causes the MFM controller to refresh the sector tracks.\" Yes, those drives did benefit from low-level formats done in the condition the drive would be operated in - with that particular controller, at that temperature range. He claimed that spinrite could detect not just whether a particular bit was a 0 or 1, but get the analog value directly from the drive by \"bypassing\" the BIOS to talk to the controller directly. And Spinrite used to have an ASCII \"graph showing these supposed values. Post MFM - IDE, SCSI, SATA, FC, etc - controllers are built-in to the drive, and low level formatting was handled by the drive's controller itself. The drive is sent a low-level format command. Gibson might have still had some claim to legitimacy left there. But then...drives shifted to using servo tracks written at the factory. The drive itself is physically incapable of doing anything to those servo tracks, and if you degauss the drive, you permanently destroy the drive because the servo tracks are wiped. The drive certainly doesn't expose via its IDE/SATA/SCSI interface any of the super-duper-low-level stuff he continued to claim to be accessing. He kept spewing the same nonsense...that his utility would boost the strength of the analog 'signal' on the drive by writing it a whole bunch. People who worked at drive manufacturers tried to work with Gibson because they were under the impression that he simply hadn't kept up with changes in hard drive technology, when the reality was (probably) that his product was snake oil and he knew it, or he was deluding himself. Example: https://radsoft.net/news/roundups/grc/20060123,00.shtml Any value Spinrite has is achieved via simply trying to read the same data over and over. If there's a failing block, the drive will remap it, and boom, your not-quite-fully-failed drive is \"working\" again. Huzzah! Except...you can do the exact same thing by simply running badblocks - free and open source - or if you're trying to recover data, use ddrescue or one of its variants, also all open source. It's basically a \"dd\" that doesn't give up - hoping that the drive might successfully read a particular area if you try enough. The better variants use a binary search to try and get every possible sector. I've used it, and it works well - I've had drives where I was able to get everything except well less than 1MB worth of data, if you gave it enough time to run. These days he's even claiming that Spinrite can improve SSD performance by repeatedly reading/writing data, which is absurd. All that is happening is Spinrite is a)wearing out the flash and b)maybe influencing what drive sectors are migrated to the SSD's SLC cache (most drives use an area of flash configured as SLC as a cache for reads/writes because it's significantly faster and more wear tolerant than areas configured as MLC, TLD, or QLC.) As a flash cell's electrical charge is reduced with each read, flash controllers automatically refresh a flash cell when necessary when a sector is read. reply ikiris 1 hour agorootparentThank you for being the voice of reason in this... mess of a thread reply jkhanlar 12 hours agoparentprev\"I feel\" are the first two words, therefore it is opinion article, the kind of opinion that does not stick to the facts, and rewards opinionated hivemind consent manufacturing.

I don't think of eBay as cheaper than amazon/b&h/etc, and the risk of a fake is just so much higher on eBay. reply PreInternet01 10 hours agoprevBefore talking about whether SpinRite was ever any good or not, it's good to consider the hard drives that were in use at the time it became popular. These early drives pretty much all came with a ST506 interface, as well as in MFM and RLL variants (there were also ESDI and SCSI drives, but since these were exclusively used on high-end systems, they're safe to ignore due to their rarity. The distinction between MFM and RLL can also be ignored, as RLL drives were really only differently-specced MFM drives that allowed the controller to do some rudimentary compression on the bitstream in order to expand usable capacity). The thing about the ST506 interface is that it was really, really simple: you (the disk controller) could seek to a track, the drive would tell you when that was done, then you could select a head, and the drive would tell you when the start of the track passed under that, and then you could read or write bits to the thus-selected cylinder. Again ignoring some finer points like precompensation and read recovery, you really only cared about three drive parameters: the number of tracks, the number of heads (multiplying these gave you the number of cylinders), plus how many bits you could approximately write to each cylinder. If you take a look at the OEM manual for the ST225 (a very popular ST506 drive at the time), the simplicity just jumps at you: https://archive.org/details/seagate-st-225-oem-manual-oct-85 You'll also notice, though, that there is no real mention of 'sectors' anywhere just yet. That's because that wasn't a drive concept, but something managed by the controller, which was responsible for dividing cylinders into sectors holding 512 bytes of user data. That division would mostly be timing-based, but to allow for error detection and recovery, the controller would add some metadata to each sector: typically, a sector number and simple checksum, which was sufficient to perform timing recovery and retry reads as required. After connecting a new drive to a given controller, the user would therefore need to run a 'low level format', typically by invoking some code in the controller card ROM BIOS, or by running a vendor-supplied utility: this would then go through all cylinders and write the metadata, including all-zero user data, for each sector. For some sectors, this would yield a write fault, and such sectors would be added to a bad sector list, resulting in a drive with a capacity slightly below that advertised. Another parameter used for this low-level format was the 'sector interleave': instead of dividing a cylinder into sectors 1-2-3-4-5 and so on, the controller would do something like 1-100-200-300-400-2-101-201-301-401-3, with the exact numbers depending on the capacity of the drive, obviously, but mostly the speed of the host system. Because PCs were really slow at the time, demanding tasks like 'reading 2 sectors sequentially' would result in a miss on the second sector, meaning having to wait for an entire disk rotation before trying again. By interleaving sectors, this miss could be avoided, greatly improving performance, but also hindering performance in case the selected interleave never or no longer (i.e. after an upgrade) matched the host speed. Now, let's turn to SpinRite. Its author, Steve Gibson, understood the relationship between disk, controller and BIOS really well, and cleverly improved on the default experience, which only provided destructive low-level formatting and virtually no diagnostics tools. By combining this understanding with a database of drive parameters and controller BIOS details (mainly: what is the address and calling convention of the per-sector read, write and format routines) and a fancy GUI, he provided some real value to early hard drive users. Initially setting up a drive with SpinRite required no obscure DEBUG commands or utilities, nor guessing of the optimal sector interleave: SpinRite would perform some tests to figure the latter out, and then perform the low-level format, with a progress bar and all, which was unheard of in vendor tooling. Even better, Gibson figured out how to do a non-destructive low-level format, and that was the true SpinRite superpower. Upgraded to a faster system and now stuck with a nonoptimal sector interleave? SpinRite could fix that for you! Did your drive degrade a bit (due to platters/heads getting out of alignment and/or the stepper motor wobbling), SpinRite could literally restore it to factory-fresh performance! So, fancy GUI and incredibly impressive marketing aside (which Gibson was really good at as well), the basic algorithm that gave SpinRite its legendary reputation was quite simple: invoke the controller BIOS to read all sectors for a few tracks into a ring buffer in RAM (employing as many retries as needed to recover the data if at all possible), re-order those sectors if changing the sector interleave, invoke the controller BIOS low-level format for the first half of these sectors (because you don't want to low-level format too close to data you haven't touched yet!), then write back the data. Rinse, repeat, with some clever handling of bad sectors and saving checkpoint data to an unused disk sector, so restarting the system during a SpinRite run rarily resulted in data loss. This worked really well for a long time, but broke down completely when disks stopped using ST506 and migrated to \"Integrated Drive Electronics\" (IDE) interfacing. When using IDE, the responsibility for managing \"sectors\" moves from the controller to the disk itself. This greatly simplified the controller-to-disk interface, as the former no longer needed to know about track or head counts: instead, the disk simply presented sequential sector numbers, LBAs. LBA-to-physical-sector mapping became a disk vendor responsibility, which it remains to this day in newer interfaces like SATA, SAS and NMVe. IDE did away with a number of things, including sector interleave, which due to the increase in host speeds was no longer relevant. But it also made it impossible to perform a 'low level format' type operation, since that was now fully a drive responsibility. Of course, the drive firmware might provide equivalent functionalty to the controller, but, especially in the early days of IDE, it definitely didn't do so. This meant that SpinRite's magic no longer worked on IDE drives. Sure: it could still attempt to read all your data (and with enough retries, that did allow for data recovery in some situations), then write it back (which might trigger a sector re-allocation in the IDE drive, but who knows), but that was about it. This did not stop Gibson from continuing to market it, and 'The Internet' from continuing to embrace it. There were rumors of SpinRite having special backdoor access to IDE controllers and such, but that was basically all nonsense. SpinRite was now `ddrescue` with some `chkdsk` and `smartmontools` thrown in, just with a much nicer user interface. So, SpinRite started out as an extremely useful tool that was worth its money, then degraded to a no-longer-magical shell of its former self that continued to be over-hyped, often passionately, for about a decade after the point it should have faded into obscurity. There is a lot of hazy discussion around these facts, but simply by looking at how the underlying tech evolved, the picture becomes pretty clear... reply cjk 14 hours agoprevI found myself agreeing with much of this article, but I have to say, I used SpinRite to great effect maybe 20 years ago on a drive that had the ‚Äúclick of death‚Äù.

You cant target particular flash cell on SSD, its impossible. There is FTL between you and raw flash. What you can do is force SSD to reinitialize whole flash with ATA Secure Erase or NVMe Secure Erase. You dont need to spend $80 on snake oil software pretending to do something else to do Secure Erase. reply mixmastamyk 1 hour agorootparentI used that word because they aren‚Äôt actually sectors, but it‚Äôs immaterial if it is a cell or the enclosing sector. They can be overwritten as a full block of course. Whether this actually resets the voltages might vary by drive, who knows‚Äîwould need to see hard data to properly verify. Without that data, both Gibson and critics are talking out their asses. Gibson is a known quantity and more reliable than internet nobodies however.

    "title": "Harnessing the Feynman Algorithm: A Brain's Natural Problem-Solving Process",
    "originLink": "https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_108_feynman_revisited/",
    "originBody": "Posted: 2024-05-26 The best description of my problem solving process is the Feynman algorithm, which is sometimes presented as a joke where the hidden subtext is ‚Äúbe smart‚Äù, but I disagree. The ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù is a surprisingly lucid description of how thinking works in the context of hard problems where the answer can‚Äôt simply be looked up or trivially broken down, iterated upon in a bottom-up fashion, or approached with similar methods. Feynman‚Äôs thinking algorithm is described like this: Write down the problem Think real hard Write down the solution (This algorithm may or may not have actually been used by Feynman, it‚Äôs as far as I can tell Murray Gell-Mann‚Äôs account of Feynman‚Äôs approach.) The trick is that there is no trick. This is how thinking works. It appears that when you feed your brain related information, without further active involvement, it starts to digest the information you‚Äôve fed it. Thinking is a background process. There‚Äôs no Sherlock Holmes-style string of brilliant deductions; the brain is a connection-making machine. If you feed it data points, it will find ways of connecting the dots. So to solve a problem, you start by feeding your mind the relevant information in a fairly literal sense. It‚Äôs a direct parallel to how you‚Äôd prompt a LLM. Just bring up all the things you think are relevant. Imagine if you were to task someone else with solving the problem, imagine what they might have use of knowing, really go over anything you think might be useful. It‚Äôs good to write that down in the simplest way possible. It should be very clear to you what question you are attempting to answer. What is written on paper is not the important thing, the act of assembling the question is the work! To answer the question, what you do next is to remove yourself from further inputs. As long as you keep feeding your brain with more data, the queries never resolve, and eventually the stuff you fed it first will fall out of the context window and amount to nothing. For this reason, it‚Äôs crucial to step away from the keyboard. Go for a walk, or sit down in a quiet place, take a shower; whatever you choose to do, just keep thinking about the problem. As you do this, all the background processing you kicked off earlier will begin to resolve. Not immediately, it may take a while‚Äîhours, sometimes days‚Äîbut as it does you get sudden insights into the problem domain. You may or may not immediately find a solution to the problem, but you‚Äôll often at least find a deeper understanding. The conclusions must be written down. Not only because these insights are fleeting and can be hard to recall, it also appears to act as a sort of feedback to the brain that the information is important, that it‚Äôs on the right track, to keep going. The perhaps most inspired period of my life was sometime in 2021, before I‚Äôd moved in with my girlfriend. What I‚Äôd inadvertently ended up doing was to arrange my life into something very similar to the algorithm above. I‚Äôd grind away and work on the search engine all week, filling my brain with all manner of information related to the work I was doing, and then I‚Äôd go visit her over the weekend, not bringing a computer. Without exception, by the time the weekend was over, I‚Äôd have several pages worth of new ideas written down in a notebook that I‚Äôd implement over the following week, rinse and repeat. I keep coming back to the gardening metaphor of thought. What you think today is the result of what you read yesterday. If you want to have relevant, interesting, useful thoughts; use your reading as a template. It will not only model the topics you are thinking about, but the very thoughts themselves. It‚Äôs as much pruning gossip and irrelevant noise as it is planting the interesting and insightful and well thought-out. Previous: Experiment in Java native calls 2024-05-16",

Writing out my explanation of the problem (its symptoms and my theories) to a colleague, even if I don't send it off, can spur me to come up with a new idea. Writing blog posts or an outline of such a blog post can help me spot gaps in my understanding and justifications. And writing down the solution, for myself two weeks ago as the intended audience, helps me internalize the important bits while filing away the minutiae for later reference. Publishing it on my blog also ensures that I spend enough time on the writeup that it is actually helpful for myself later, and not just a mess of notes. reply Sn0wCoder 3 hours agoparentI have often thought about writing a blog from my experiences, but after I write the thoughts down seem like common sense in nature or just plain ranting. Writing it down gets it off my chest / mind, but publishing has never happened. I do keep all the notes so I can revisit them. Often do this with emails too but I delete them if I do not send them after 48 hours. It has taught me to never send an angry email in the ‚Äòheat of the moment‚Äô and to reflect on the content as if I were to receive such an email. The best one I have is letting others fail, they are going to anyway. When put on a new project with a new team who has been working together for a while, they are NOT going to listen to you no matter how much experience you have even if you consider yourself a SME.

The mondane version being fending of rage. But other times, you just develop the answer to your question while writing the question down. On a similar thought, this is why coding is an inherent part of my way of dealing with problems. The rigour required to get a piece of code to work helps me understand concepts. So when learning things, I sometimes end up writing a piece of code to model the domain, just to help me understand it. reply j7ake 2 hours agoprevIn research, reaching the point of \"writing down the problem\" is already a huge accomplishment. What distinguishes the first-rate researchers and the second is their (1) ability to identify which problems are worth their finite time in solving, (2) defining the problem so that it is manageable but impactful, (3) using approaches other people in th field have not thought of to tackle the problem. reply shiomiru 2 hours agoprevI would also add a step 1.5: write down the wrong solution.

This is probably another case where the answer depends on the attitude towards LLMs and maybe technology overall. For me I think that this is largely how I use LLMs for programming. I use the aider program, add the relevant source files, explain what I want to do and the approach I want, and ask it to do it. It does routinely miss obvious things. But then it's also often fairly easy to ask it to correct itself. It depends on the nature and complexity of the problem though. But theoretically the LLM would have a couple of useful ideas or feedback if you really give it all of the context. But maybe defining the problem and the relevant information is the hard part. Perhaps having significantly larger context windows is a bigger deal than some people might realize. If the LLM or multimodal model has a very large context window and also enough computing resources to constantly or routinely decide what the goal is.. Then the other part would be having a large pool of potentially relevant information to select from in approaching the problem. But basically we might be able to skip the step where we select the relevant information and let the AI do that, if we have a large enough context window. Which might lead to the question, why did we even get out of bed. But that's another problem. I get the impression that diffusion transformers are a big deal.

Because of this drawback, LLMs are actually a decent model for this sort of process since we can observe how they operate. I'm not claiming they're actually intelligent like we are, but rather that they model the process of drawing connections and making associations close enough to how we think to the point where it's an useful analogy. reply mortify 3 hours agoparentprevThere are parallels. You feed an LLM context data and then tell it what to focus on so it can pull relevant data. Maybe the entire process isn't like feeding an LLM, but that step is. Relevance identification is an interesting part of the process. The LLM can do a decent job of making connections, but it doesn't know what is relevant. In the longer time frame of the thinking process, we constantly throw out data as irrelevant or identify previously unknown relevant data that needs to be added. It's a part of the process completely outside of the LLM. reply conradolandia 2 hours agorootparentBut we really don't know that, do we? reply the__alchemist 3 hours agoparentprevI think, if you adopt this mindset, acutely any process that involves precise instruction could be dismissed.

If you try to remember what you are trying to remember on the spot often you can't. Then you stop trying and all the sudden (and later) the answer comes to you. (One example: Happens often when trying to remember the name of an actor 'I know who that is' then later 'ok it was...') I think this is also related to why some people don't test well. A question in a test format or information requested formulated as a question (that need an immediate answer) doesn't work for many people with facts that are memorized. In fact extreme pressure can sometimes prevent recall just because of the anxiety alone that that produces. reply gist 3 hours agoprev\"To answer the question, what you do next is to remove yourself from further inputs.

As a relatable example, suppose you're taking an exam. There's a problem near the end that you don't know how to solve‚Äîand the reason is that you haven't studied that topic enough. No matter how smart (as in, fast at learning) you are, you need to practice with similar or related problems to solve that issue. But suppose you're outside of an exam environment and have time to look up the relevant material. I've known a PhD candidate in a non-mathematics field who had to find a mathematical solution to a certain research problem. That person is smart but still needed a few months to learn the mathematical fundamentals to understand and solve the problem. In contrast, someone with a math background could have solved this far more quickly. But that person would have taken at least some months to get up to speed on the research literature for the non-mathematics part of the research problem, in order to properly understand its constraints and bigger-picture significance. Lara Alcock's book \"How to Study as a Mathematics Major\" touches upon this topic more directly. She encourages readers not to be too intimidated if other students in a course seem really smart: much of the time, the reason is not due to an innate difference in smartness, but rather prior exposure by other students to concepts in the course. Students who seem to find the material effortless often have already studied many of the topics in another course or could even be retaking the course after a previous attempt. reply mortify 3 hours agoparentprevWhile thinking is somewhat of a background process, our brains don't just solve the mysteries of the universe while we eat a ham sandwich. We tell our brains which problems are of high importance and it focuses on them. If you've ever laid down to go to sleep and told yourself to wake up at 6:30 and it worked, you've witnessed an obvious application of this. The problem comes when we fail to point out the importance of a problem, or when we do so reflexively which means that we tell our brain that everything is important and it simply cannot process all of the requests. Setting your thinking requests before doing a non-thinking activity is a good way to start. Think about the problem consciously and then specifically ask for an answer to a question. Then go do something physical or mechanical: take a walk, sleep, mow the lawn, watch a non-challenging movie, etc. Be prepared to accept whatever result you get. A common response is: non enough information, but it should point you toward what that additional info looks like. reply mandmandam 3 hours agoparentprevThis is a very interesting question. When you plant a seed in a garden, there's many factors at play - is the season right? Is the climate right for that seed? Is the soil the right type? Are there pests or varmints roaming that might eat it prematurely? Etc. The garden of thought has analogous factors: Is this a question your brain actually cares about right now? Do you have the background knowledge necessary to work it out? Is your brain calm enough to process that question? Are there distractions or anxieties that disturb the process? That said, some people truly are stupid. I recently read John Cleese's autobiography, and he tells a story from when he was a Geography teacher... There was a lad who he was teaching countries and their capitals. Even when given direct attention, the kid simply wasn't able to name any capitals whatsoever. He would smile and nod, giving no indication of difficulties... But he couldn't recall the info even after being told it 8 seconds previously. This particular type of data slid off his brain. At the end of the term, the kid got one question right on the final exam, probably by accident. Cleese posted the paper in the teacher's room, attracting the comment from one teacher \"The sad thing about true stupidity is that you can do absolutely nothing about it\". Perhaps that kid had a genius for engines or something, but he was never going to be able to understand geopolitics. He lacked even the awareness to know that he was stupid (at least about countries and capitals). He would never have asked if he was stupid, because he was truly stupid. If your friend is ever curious about their intelligence, they're probably ok and can develop the skill of thinking like this. reply mortify 3 hours agorootparent>some people truly are stupid. This is a difficult fact to accept. We have all been told that people are generally equal, especially in intelligence, if given the same opportunities, but it becomes more clear in time that some problems are intractable to some people and no amount of training or exposure can change that. However, it's a better answer to the problem of why some people like Cleese's example do not absorb information. The alternative is to apply malice and laziness to them when it just isn't so. We all have these intelligence holes that gives some insight into the mechanism. Eg. I'm bad at remembering names. As in the example, if you tell me someone's name, I'm likely to forget it 5 minutes later. I just spent 3 years reading Douglas Hofstadter's book and had to look up his name to type it here. This seems to happen because I don't see an application to remembering the name. I'm never going to meet Doug and rarely will anyone need to be told about the book, so why remember it? There's definitely a parallel to state capitals in that example. reply kreeben 2 hours agorootparentWell said about not realizing it's important therefore names get down prioritized.

The solution (and the shortcomings in that solution and in the original problem statement) are the seed clearing the dirt. As you write, think, and write again, the plant grows and takes form until the time is right for the flower to bloom. Then the bloom slowly dies, unnoticed by the majority (beautiful in their place, but with no generalizable characteristics), or as the work becomes common knowledge and is integrated into better and more complex solutions to bigger and harder problems. The most beautiful flowers are mass produced for public consumption ($e=mc^2$, and the like), but those are rather few and far between. reply swayvil 1 hour agorootparentOr.

    "originLink": "https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2012/05/16/majorana-demonstrator/",
    "originBody": "The helicity, or handedness, of neutrinos has only been observed in two states, left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. Whether these are really the only two neutrino handedness states depends on whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles. In a cavern almost a mile underground in the Black Hills, an experiment called the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR, 40 kilograms of pure germanium crystals enclosed in deep-freeze cryostat modules, will soon set out to answer one of the most persistent and momentous questions in physics: are neutrinos their own antiparticles? If the answer is yes, it will require rewriting the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions, our basic understanding of the physical world. ‚ÄúThe best way to learn whether neutrinos are their own antiparticles would be to observe a certain kind of radioactive decay, called neutrinoless double-beta decay. It has never been detected conclusively, and if it occurs at all, it‚Äôs exceedingly rare,‚Äù says Alan Poon of the Nuclear Science Division at the U.S. Department of Energy‚Äôs Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). Poon is the current executive-committee chair of the MAJORANA Collaboration, which is comprised of more than 100 researchers from 19 institutions in the United States, Canada, Russia, and Japan, and whose efforts are focused on the experiment now under construction at the Davis Campus of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. Beta decay, single and double Ordinary beta decay is a common kind of radioactivity: an atomic nucleus changes into a different kind of element, a neighbor on the periodic table with lower mass, by emitting a beta particle ‚Äì an electron or positron ‚Äì plus a neutrino or an antineutrino. For example, carbon-14 transforms to nitrogen-14 when one of its neutrons turns into a proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino. It was beta decay that led to the proposal that there must be a particle like the neutrino, since an electron alone could not account for all the energy lost in the decay. Carbon 14 decays to nitrogen 14 by emitting an electron and an antineutrino, while changing one of its neutrons to a proton and transforming the nucleus one place higher in the periodic table ‚Äì a common kind of single beta decay. In a rare double-beta decay, for example when germanium 76 changes to selenium 76, two neutrons change to protons while emitting two electrons and two antineutrinos, transforming the nucleus two places higher in the periodic table. (Click on image for best resolution.) ‚ÄúDouble-beta decay is also possible and has been observed in a dozen different isotopes since 1986,‚Äù says Poon. ‚ÄúBut it happens at a really low rate, and not too many nuclei can do it.‚Äù The only conclusive double-beta decays seen so far involve two neutrons that change into two protons while emitting two electrons and two antineutrinos. It‚Äôs an uncommon situation, in which single beta decay is blocked because the decaying isotope‚Äôs immediate neighbor has a nucleus that‚Äôs too heavy, but the nucleus of the neighbor two places away on the periodic table does have lower mass ‚Äì even though its atomic number is two places higher. Getting there requires double-beta decay. One of the relatively few nuclei that can transform by double-beta decay is germanium-76 (76Ge), an isotope that accounts for less than eight percent of naturally occurring germanium. Germanium-76 can‚Äôt change to its neighbor, arsenic-76, but it can change to selenium-76, two places higher on the periodic table. Many reference works refer to germanium-76 as stable, but double-beta decays of 76Ge have been observed since the 1990s, and its half-life has recently been estimated at 1.3 x 1021 years, or roughly one and a third sextillion years. That‚Äôs 100 trillion times the age of the universe. Not quite stable. How do you detect such a rare event? If you watch a single germanium-76 atom for one and a third sextillion years, the chances are 50-50 you‚Äôll see it decay. On the other hand, if you watch one and a third sextillion germanium-76 atoms for just one year, the chances are 50-50 that you‚Äôll catch at least one of them decaying. In essence, that‚Äôs what MAJORANA proposes to do. The full MAJORANA concept calls for a metric ton or so of germanium diode detectors, enriched to 86 percent 76Ge. Over the course of a year, a detector that size has a good chance of catching double-beta decays, although most will be accompanied by a pair of antineutrinos. Searching for an absence of neutrinos Identifying neutrinoless double-beta decays depends crucially on getting rid of background from cosmic rays and natural radioactivity in the surroundings. That‚Äôs the purpose of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR: to show that achieving a low enough background is indeed possible. A mile of rock overhead is an effective shield against most cosmic ray debris, but radioactivity from the environment, including from impurities in the experiment‚Äôs own components, is harder to avoid. Individual detectors made of pure germanium are assembled in strings and remotely loaded into the lead- and copper-shielded MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR. Jason Detwiler of the Nuclear Science Division, who has been involved with the MAJORANA project since 2005, says, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre spending a lot of time modeling every one of the DEMONSTRATOR‚Äôs thousands of individual parts, to make sure we can achieve the lowest backgrounds of any experiment of this kind ever ‚Äì a hundred times lower.‚Äù The MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR will be shielded with multiple layers of copper and lead against radioactive elements in the surrounding rock, and the detector will be built from ultrapure materials. Copper components are being formed underground in special facilities at SURF, to remove natural radioactivity and prevent contamination from cosmic rays. Equally important is the detector‚Äôs ability to distinguish the background from double-beta decays inside the detector itself. Pure germanium is ideal for this purpose, both as a source of double-beta decays and, says Detwiler, as a detector that ‚Äúcan register the signal of nuclear decays cleanly, beautifully, and in high resolution.‚Äù Nuclear decays and other events create charge carriers that drift toward the collecting electrode on the surface of the germanium diode. The way the carriers drift ‚Äì their ‚Äúpulse shape‚Äù ‚Äì will clearly distinguish background events from a neutrinoless double-beta decay. Why Majorana So far the only known particles that are their own antiparticles are all bosons, particles that often carry force or mediate interactions, such as the photon, the pi-zero, or the Z. Ettore Majorana, a brilliant Italian theoretician who had a brief career in the 1920s and 30s but vanished mysteriously at the age of 32, was the first to propose that some fermions, particles of matter, might also be their own antiparticles. That these hypothetical particles are today known as Majorana fermions is due to Enrico Fermi. Majorana considered his work ‚Äúbanal‚Äù and was famously blas√© about promoting it. Earlier Fermi had urged him to write up his ideas about a neutral particle with the mass of the proton, but he didn‚Äôt bother, and the credit (and a Nobel Prize) went to James Chadwick for the discovery of the neutron. When it came to Majorana‚Äôs theory that fermions could be their own antiparticles, Enrico Fermi took no chances: he wrote the paper himself and signed Majorana‚Äôs name to it. Majorana suffered increasing depression and in 1938 boarded a ferry from Palermo to Naples. He never arrived. Speculation has ranged from suicide, to escape to Argentina, to retreat to a monastery. Although matter and antimatter annihilate when they meet, no one has yet suggested that Ettore Majorana met his anti-Majorana on the fateful voyage. ‚ÄúBerkeley Lab developed germanium detectors decades ago, so we have a history of strength and expertise in design and manufacture,‚Äù Detwiler says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working with a U.S.-based commercial vendor to turn germanium-76, enriched at an isotope separation facility in Russia, into working detectors. We‚Äôll mount them with low-noise electronics developed here.‚Äù The first pure germanium in the DEMONSTRATOR will be a natural mix of isotopes, setting a baseline for response to background events. Eventually 30 kilograms of the detector‚Äôs 40-kilogram total will be enriched to 86-percent germanium-76, narrowing the chance that background signals could compete with the discovery of an actual neutrinoless double-beta decay event. Such an event would be easy to identify, because the energy of its two electrons would add to precisely 2.039 million electron volts (2.039 MeV), and none would be shared with antineutrinos. With a low enough background, MAJORANA will be able to easily separate the sharp spike of a 2.039 MeV two-electron event from a broad smear of energies shared among four different particles. Rewriting the Standard Model Mass is essential to oscillation among the three neutrino flavors, but no one knows the precise mass of any of the flavors or why it‚Äôs so small. Neutrinoless double-beta decay offers a unique window on that question. If MAJORANA can go beyond showing that neutrinoless double-beta decay exists to showing how often it occurs, it may be able to establish the mass scale of neutrinos directly. The key is their handedness, or helicity (which refers to how their linear momentum and quantum spin are aligned). If neutrinos and antineutrinos are two distinct particles, each could be either right-handed or left-handed, for a total of four quantum states. If neutrinos and antineutrinos are just one particle, however, it has only two states of handedness. In fact only two states, left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos, have ever been observed. A diagram of neutrinoless double-beta decay shows a right-handed antineutrino emitted when a neutron decays (also emitting an electron). The antineutrino flips its handedness and is absorbed by a second neutron, which also decays (and emits a second electron). Only a single antiparticle/particle is involved. How fast it can flip its handedness depends on its mass: the more massive, the easier the flip, and the more often this kind of decay will occur. In neutrinoless double-beta decay, a single particle would be emitted as one neutron changes to a proton. This right-handed antineutrino would be absorbed as a left-handed neutrino by a second neutron, causing it too to change to a proton. Two electrons account for the total difference in energy between the nuclei. But there‚Äôs a catch, says Poon. ‚ÄúThe fascinating thing about neutrinoless double-beta decay is that it would violate one of the basic principles of the Standard Model, in which all interactions supposedly conserve lepton number. Electrons and neutrinos are both leptons, so if an interaction produces two electrons, that‚Äôs a plus two. In the usual kind of double‚Äìbeta decay, two antineutrinos are also emitted ‚Äì antiparticles with minus lepton numbers, which is a minus two. Lepton number is conserved at zero.‚Äù Not so with neutrinoless double-beta decay, however, which raises the lepton number from zero to two. ‚ÄúThe Standard Model leaves many outstanding questions, and we know it needs revision,‚Äù Poon says, ‚Äúbut we cannot write a new theory until we know if neutrinos are their own antiparticles, or how we‚Äôre going to accommodate the loss of lepton number conservation if they are, and a number of other questions, including neutrino mass.‚Äù In the race to answer these questions, the MAJORANA Collaboration is competing with another important germanium experiment, the GERDA experiment at the underground Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy. But it‚Äôs a competition with a twist: ‚ÄúGERDA has a different shielding concept, using liquid argon and water, and between us we‚Äôll find out which has the lower background,‚Äù says Poon. ‚ÄúWe may join forces to build the final one-ton detector.‚Äù Germanium-76 is not the only element that can undergo double-beta decay. Other detectors use isotopes of tellurium, xenon, neodymium, or other elements. Poon says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to establish that any instance of neutrinoless double-beta decay really reflects the property of the neutrino. If the process is seen in more than one element, that‚Äôs very strong evidence that the neutrino is indeed its own antiparticle.‚Äù ### Berkeley Lab members of the MAJORANA Collaboration include Yuen-Dat Chan, Jason Detwiler, James Loach, Ryan Martin, Alan Poon, and Kai Vetter of the Nuclear Science Division, and Mark Amman, Paul Barton, Paul Luke, and Harold Yaver of the Engineering Division.

In \"ordinary\" beta decay, the (anti)neutrino takes part of the decay energy and hence the energy spectrum of the electron emitted is \"blurry\". \"ordinary double beta\" would imply the same, both of the (seen) emitted electrons should show an energy spectrum. If at least some of these double-betas were neutrinoless, the two electrons would take the entire decay energy. If you observe a lot of double-beta, you should therefore see the \"smooth\" ordinary (non-neutrinoless) spectrum ... with an excess at the top end (neutrinoless). Is that correct? I.e. we're basically trying to measure enough double beta to get an energy distribution spectrum, and then hope/expect to see a \"majorana peak\" at the top end? reply mmastrac 19 hours agoprevThe article takes about 66% of its content before it actually explains why \"Majorana\" -- from the theoretician Ettore Majorana: > So far the only known particles that are their own antiparticles are all bosons, particles that often carry force or mediate interactions, such as the photon, the pi-zero, or the Z.

Demonstration of neutrino less double beta decay would prove majorana conjectures and point to fractures in the ‚Äústandard model of physics‚Äù meaning new fundamental particles would be needed. In my opinion whoever measures the CvB (cosmic neutrino background) will be more compelling because it isn‚Äôt a nullification result, it‚Äôs a result that would tell us far more about the Big Bang than we know now. Neutrinos are hard to measure, have been the source of a lot of Nobel prizes! Disclaimer: I use to work at lbl reply dphidt 5 hours agorootparentIf there's a prior in the community, my impression (as a neutrino physicist) is that if anything it's more toward Majorana than not, in the absence of evidence either way. It is surely nicer from a theory perspective, with a (seesaw) mechanism to help explain the very light neutrino masses, and lepton number violation that helps in the case for leptogenesis as an explanation for the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry, etc. One way I think about it is that it's pretty interesting either way: Majorana demands physics beyond the Standard Model, while Dirac would seem to suggest that lepton number is more than an accidental symmetry of the Standard Model, implying some unknown quantum number. Meanwhile, many experimental searches for neutrinoless double beta decay go on, with many new/clever ideas to carve through the quite large allowed parameter space. reply jessriedel 16 hours agorootparentprevThe CvB is the holy grail.

You're pretty much using the same tech, and the pre-requisite is simple \"sunshine\". But wind is more complex. If you want to generate a lot, then you need space (to build a tower), height (higher is better) and size (bigger is MUCH better.) And wind. But if you just need a little, say 3kw, then you're not looking for the best possible outcome, you're looking for local outcome. Most of us are location bound. I want to generate energy here - because I use it here. There are constraints (noise, size, height etc.) that I live with. Sure, I've got solar, my roof is full of that. Let's stipulate that economically I'm better off adding more solar. Let's also stipulate that my roof is \"full\". I get quite a few windy days (and windy nights) a year. If I harvest 1kw/h, I'd be happy. If I generate excess I can sell it to the grid. The obvious answer is still a 3 or 5 bladed conventional wind turbine. But that is both visual, and can be noisy. Personally, I don't need it to compete economicly with solar. I don't need it to be \"perfect wind efficient\". All I need is around 3kw capacity (for 1kw output) in a residential friendly package. Solar has shown that individuals are prepared to spend capital on residential generation. And in sufficient volume to move the grid needle. I'd love to see similar opportunities for those with more wind and less sun. reply kibwen 12 hours agorootparentNote that wind is a good complement to solar, because it's largely driven by the heat from the ground rising upward, so it tends to start picking up in the afternoon/evening as solar starts to dip. reply readyman 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat is kw/h? reply _Microft 7 hours agorootparentWhat is kw/h with a lowercase w?

Or 1 knot for 1 hour, which equals 1 nautical mile. You can say \"I have travelled a distance of 1 knot-hour or 1 knot for an hour\". It doesn't make any sense to say \"I have travelled a distance of 1 knot/hour or 1 knot per hour\". Knot/hour would be a unit of acceleration not distance. Ok that's probably clear as mud.

The reason the big boys work well is because they are much higher above the ground where the wind is stronger and more consistent.

    "originBody": "Taming Floating-Point Sums 2024-05-25 Suppose you have an array of floating-point numbers, and wish to sum them. You might naively think you can simply add them, e.g. in Rust: fn naive_sum(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { let mut out = 0.0; for x in arr { out += *x; } out } This however can easily result in an arbitrarily large accumulated error. Let‚Äôs try it out: naive_sum(&vec![1.0; 1_000_000]) = 1000000.0 naive_sum(&vec![1.0; 10_000_000]) = 10000000.0 naive_sum(&vec![1.0; 100_000_000]) = 16777216.0 naive_sum(&vec![1.0; 1_000_000_000]) = 16777216.0 Uh-oh‚Ä¶ What happened? The problem is that the next 32-bit floating-point number after 16777216 is 16777218. So when you compute 16777216 + 1, it rounds back to the nearest floating-point number with an even mantissa, which happens to be 16777216 again. We‚Äôre stuck. Luckily, there are better ways to sum an array. Pairwise summation A method that‚Äôs a bit more clever is to use pairwise summation. Instead of a completely linear sum with a single accumulator it recursively sums an array by splitting the array in half, summing the halves, and then adding the sums. fn pairwise_sum(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { if arr.len() == 0 { return 0.0; } if arr.len() == 1 { return arr[0]; } let (first, second) = arr.split_at(arr.len() / 2); pairwise_sum(first) + pairwise_sum(second) } This is more accurate: pairwise_sum(&vec![1.0; 1_000_000]) = 1000000.0 pairwise_sum(&vec![1.0; 10_000_000]) = 10000000.0 pairwise_sum(&vec![1.0; 100_000_000]) = 100000000.0 pairwise_sum(&vec![1.0; 1_000_000_000]) = 1000000000.0 However, this is rather slow. To get a summation routine that goes as fast as possible while still being reasonably accurate we should not recurse down all the way to length-1 arrays, as this gives too much call overhead. We can still use our naive sum for small sizes, and only recurse on large sizes. This does make our worst-case error worse by a constant factor, but in turn makes the pairwise sum almost as fast as a naive sum. By choosing the splitpoint as a multiple of 256 we ensure that the base case in the recursion always has exactly 256 elements except on the very last block. This makes sure we use the most optimal reduction and always correctly predict the loop condition. This small detail ended up improving the throughput by 40% for large arrays! fn block_pairwise_sum(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { if arr.len() > 256 { let split = (arr.len() / 2).next_multiple_of(256); let (first, second) = arr.split_at(split); block_pairwise_sum(first) + block_pairwise_sum(second) } else { naive_sum(arr) } } Kahan summation The worst-case round-off error of naive summation scales with ùëÇ ( ùëõ ùúñ ) O(nœµ) when summing ùëõ n elements, where ùúñ œµ is the machine epsilon of your floating-point type (here 2 ‚àí 24 2‚àí24). Pairwise summation improves this to ùëÇ ( ( log ‚Å° ùëõ ) ùúñ + ùëõ ùúñ 2 ) O((logn)œµ+nœµ2). However, Kahan summation improves this further to ùëÇ ( ùëõ ùúñ 2 ) O(nœµ2), eliminating the ùúñ œµ term entirely, leaving only the ùúñ 2 œµ2 term which is negligible unless you sum a very large amount of numbers. All of these bounds scale with ‚àë ùëñ ‚à£ ùë• ùëñ ‚à£ ‚àëi‚à£xi‚à£, so the worst-case absolute error bound is still quadratic in terms of ùëõ n even for Kahan summation. In practice all summation algorithms do significantly better than their worst-case bounds, as in most scenarios the errors do not exclusively round up or down, but cancel each other out on average. pub fn kahan_sum(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { let mut sum = 0.0; let mut c = 0.0; for x in arr { let y = *x - c; let t = sum + y; c = (t - sum) - y; sum = t; } sum } The Kahan summation works by maintaining the sum in two registers, the actual bulk sum and a small error correcting term ùëê c. If you were using infinitely precise arithmetic ùëê c would always be zero, but with floating-point it might not be. The downside is that each number now takes four operations to add to the sum instead of just one. To mitigate this we can do something similar to what we did with the pairwise summation. We can first accumulate blocks into sums naively before combining the block sums with Kaham summation to reduce overhead at the cost of accuracy: pub fn block_kahan_sum(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { let mut sum = 0.0; let mut c = 0.0; for chunk in arr.chunks(256) { let x = naive_sum(chunk); let y = x - c; let t = sum + y; c = (t - sum) - y; sum = t; } sum } Exact summation I know of at least two general methods to produce the correctly-rounded sum of a sequence of floating-point numbers. That is, it logically computes the sum with infinite precision before rounding it back to a floating-point value at the end. The first method is based on the 2Sum primitive which is an error-free transform from two numbers ùë• , ùë¶ x,y to ùë† , ùë° s,t such that ùë• + ùë¶ = ùë† + ùë° x+y=s+t, where ùë° t is a small error. By applying this repeatedly until the errors vanish you can get a correctly-rounded sum. Keeping track of what to add in what order can be tricky, and the worst-case requires ùëÇ ( ùëõ 2 ) O(n2) additions to make all the terms vanish. This is what‚Äôs implemented in Python‚Äôs math.fsum and in the Rust crate fsum which use extra memory to keep the partial sums around. The accurate crate also implements this using in-place mutation in i_fast_sum_in_place. Another method is to keep a large buffer of integers around, one per exponent. Then when adding a floating-point number you decompose it into a an exponent and mantissa, and add the mantissa to the corresponding integer in the buffer. If the integer buf[i] overflows you increment the integer in buf[i + w], where w is the width of your integer. This can actually compute a completely exact sum, without any rounding at all, and is effectively just an overly permissive representation of a fixed-point number optimized for accumulating floats. This latter method is ùëÇ ( ùëõ ) O(n) time, but uses a large but constant amount of memory ( ‚âà ‚âà 1 KB for f32, ‚âà ‚âà 16 KB for f64). An advantage of this method is that it‚Äôs also an online algorithm - both adding a number to the sum and getting the current total are amortized ùëÇ ( 1 ) O(1). A variant of this method is implemented in the accurate crate as OnlineExactSum crate which uses floats instead of integers for the buffer. Unleashing the compiler Besides accuracy, there is another problem with naive_sum. The Rust compiler is not allowed to reorder floating-point additions, because floating-point addition is not associative. So it cannot autovectorize the naive_sum to use SIMD instructions to compute the sum, nor use instruction-level parallelism. To solve this there are compiler intrinsics in Rust that do float sums while allowing associativity, such as std::intrinsics::fadd_fast. However, these instructions are incredibly dangerous, as they assume that both the input and output are finite numbers (no infinities, no NaNs), or otherwise they are undefined behavior. This functionally makes them unusable, as only in the most restricted scenarios when computing a sum do you know that all inputs are finite numbers, and that their sum cannot overflow. I recently uttered my annoyance with these operators to Ben Kimock, and together we proposed (and he implemented) a new set of operators: std::intrinsics::fadd_algebraic and friends. I proposed we call the operators algebraic, as they allow (in theory) any transformation that is justified by real algebra. For example, substituting ùë• ‚àí ùë• ‚Üí 0 x‚àíx‚Üí0, ùëê ùë• + ùëê ùë¶ ‚Üí ùëê ( ùë• + ùë¶ ) cx+cy‚Üíc(x+y), or ùë• 6 ‚Üí ( ùë• 2 ) 3 . x6‚Üí(x2)3. In general these operators are treated as-if they are done using real numbers, and can map to any set of floating-point instructions that would be equivalent to the original expression, assuming the floating-point instructions would be exact. Note that the real numbers do not contain NaNs or infinities, so these operators assume those do not exist for the validity of transformations, however it is not undefined behavior when you do encounter those values. They also allow fused multiply-add instructions to be generated, as under real arithmetic fma ‚Å° ( ùëé , ùëè , ùëê ) = ùëé ùëè + ùëê . fma(a,b,c)=ab+c. Using those new instructions it is trivial to generate an autovectorized sum: #![allow(internal_features)] #![feature(core_intrinsics)] use std::intrinsics::fadd_algebraic; fn naive_sum_autovec(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { let mut out = 0.0; for x in arr { out = fadd_algebraic(out, *x); } out } If we compile with -C target-cpu=broadwell we see that the compiler automatically generated the following tight loop for us, using 4 accumulators and AVX2 instructions: .LBB0_5: vaddps ymm0, ymm0, ymmword ptr [rdi + 4*r8] vaddps ymm1, ymm1, ymmword ptr [rdi + 4*r8 + 32] vaddps ymm2, ymm2, ymmword ptr [rdi + 4*r8 + 64] vaddps ymm3, ymm3, ymmword ptr [rdi + 4*r8 + 96] add r8, 32 cmp rdx, r8 jne .LBB0_5 This will process 128 bytes of floating-point data (so 32 elements) in 7 instructions. Additionally, all the vaddps instructions are independent of each other as they accumulate to different registers. If we analyze this with uiCA we see that it estimates the above loop to take 4 cycles to complete, processing 32 bytes / cycle. At 4GHz that‚Äôs up to 128GB/s! Note that that‚Äôs way above what my machine‚Äôs RAM bandwidth is, so you will only achieve that speed when summing data that is already in cache. With this in mind we can also easily define block_pairwise_sum_autovec and block_kahan_sum_autovec by replacing their calls to naive_sum with naive_sum_autovec. Accuracy and speed Let‚Äôs take a look at how the different summation methods compare. As a relatively arbitrary benchmark, let‚Äôs sum 100,000 random floats ranging from -100,000 to +100,000. This is 400 KB worth of data, so it still fits in cache on my AMD Threadripper 2950x. All the code is available on Github. Compiled with RUSTFLAGS=-C target-cpu=native and --release I get the following results: Algorithm Throughput Mean absolute error naive 5.5 GB/s 71.796 pairwise 0.9 GB/s 1.5528 kahan 1.4 GB/s 0.2229 block_pairwise 5.8 GB/s 3.8597 block_kahan 5.9 GB/s 4.2184 naive_autovec 118.6 GB/s 14.538 block_pairwise_autovec 71.7 GB/s 1.6132 block_kahan_autovec 98.0 GB/s 1.2306 crate_accurate_buffer 1.1 GB/s 0.0015 crate_accurate_inplace 1.9 GB/s 0.0015 crate_fsum 1.2 GB/s 0.0000 The reason the accurate crate has a non-zero absolute error is because it currently does not implement rounding to nearest correctly, so it can be off by one unit in the last place for the final result. First I‚Äôd like to note that there‚Äôs more than a 100x performance difference between the fastest and slowest method. For summing an array! Now this might not be entirely fair as the slowest methods are computing something significantly harder, but there‚Äôs still a 20x performance difference between a seemingly reasonable naive implementation and the fastest one. We find that in general the _autovec methods that use fadd_algebraic are faster and more accurate than the ones using regular floating-point addition. The reason they‚Äôre more accurate as well is the same reason a pairwise sum is more accurate: any reordering of the additions is better as the default long-chain-of-additions is already the worst case for accuracy in a sum. Limiting ourselves to Pareto-optimal choices we get the following four implementations: Algorithm Throughput Mean absolute error naive_autovec 118.6 GB/s 14.538 block_kahan_autovec 98.0 GB/s 1.2306 crate_accurate_inplace 1.9 GB/s 0.0015 crate_fsum 1.2 GB/s 0.0000 Note that implementation differences can be quite impactful, and there are likely dozens more methods of compensated summing I did not compare here. For most cases I think block_kahan_autovec wins here, having good accuracy (that doesn‚Äôt degenerate with larger inputs) at nearly the maximum speed. For most applications the extra accuracy from the correctly-rounded sums is unnecessary, and they are 50-100x slower. By splitting the loop up into an explicit remainder plus a tight loop of 256-element sums we can squeeze out a bit more performance, and avoid a couple floating-point ops for the last chunk: #![allow(internal_features)] #![feature(core_intrinsics)] use std::intrinsics::fadd_algebraic; fn sum_block(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { arr.iter().fold(0.0, |x, y| fadd_algebraic(x, *y)) } pub fn sum_orlp(arr: &[f32]) -> f32 { let mut chunks = arr.chunks_exact(256); let mut sum = 0.0; let mut c = 0.0; for chunk in &mut chunks { let y = sum_block(chunk) - c; let t = sum + y; c = (t - sum) - y; sum = t; } sum + (sum_block(chunks.remainder()) - c) } Algorithm Throughput Mean absolute error sum_orlp 112.2 GB/s 1.2306 You can of course tweak the number 256, I found that using 128 was ‚âà ‚âà 20% slower, and that 512 didn‚Äôt really improve performance but did cost accuracy. Conclusion I think the fadd_algebraic and similar algebraic intrinsics are very useful for achieving high-speed floating-point routines, and that other languages should add them as well. A global -ffast-math is not good enough, as we‚Äôve seen above the best implementation was a hybrid between automatically optimized math for speed, and manually implemented non-associative compensated operations. Finally, if you are using LLVM, beware of -ffast-math. It is undefined behavior to produce a NaN or infinity while that flag is set in LLVM. I have no idea why they chose this hardcore stance which makes virtually every program that uses it unsound. If you are targetting LLVM with your language, avoid the nnan and ninf fast-math flags.",

I think these methods are probably faster than the exact methods you benchmark. reply Infinity315 20 hours agoprevA method which this article doesn't mention is stochastic rounding or probabilistic rounding. Rather than striving for exact values for every computation, we make it so that the expected value is exact. For example, suppose our number system was restricted to the integers and we have incoming value 1.1, with stochastic rounding we'd round down to 1 90% of the time and 2 10% of the time giving an expected value of 1.1! Further reading: https://nhigham.com/2020/07/07/what-is-stochastic-rounding/ reply tzs 19 hours agoparentIt's not really related, but that reminds me of how some games handled slow moving objects on the Mattel Intellivision console. Your code that runs every frame to update the graphics logically wants to do something like this: X += Vx Y += Vy where (X, Y) is the location of the object at the start of the frame, and (Vx, Vy) is x and y velocities of the object in pixels/frame. To allow for velocities that aren't an integer number of pixels per frame and that are slower than 1 pixel per frame you'd want to actually store X in a fixed point format, say (Xi, Xf) where Xi is the integer part of the X position, and Xf is the fractional part times 256, so X = Xi + Xf/256. Similarly for Y. The object only actually moves on the screen when Xi or Yi changes. Similarly velocity would also be in that format: Vx = Vxi + Vxf/256, and similar for Vy. With that, the position update in your loop would be something like this: Xf += Vxf if that wrapped Xi += 1 Xi += Vxi and similar for Y. For each object you end up needing 8 bytes (1 byte for each of Xi, Xf, Yi, Yf, Vxi, Vxf, Vyi, Vyf). That doesn't sound like much but the Intellivision only had something like 240 bytes in the console available. (If you couldn't get your RAM requirements down to that it was possible to have extra RAM in the cartridge but that would raise the cost). So someone figured out that you didn't actually need to store Xf and Yf. Just generate then at random as needed! The loop then becomes something like this: rb = random_unsigned_byte() if Vxf + rb wraps Xi += 1 Xi += Vxi and similar for Y. That turns out to work quite reasonably. Essentially it is interpreting Vxf as meaning that the object has a Vxf/256 chance of crossing a pixel boundary on a given frame. Thinking of it that way then suggests getting rid of the addition of the random byte with a wrap check and just doing a compare instead: if Vxf > random_unsigned_byte() Xi += 1 Xi += Vxi and similar for Y. Net result: we've cut the RAM for storing position and velocity from 8 bytes per object to 6, at the cost of needing to generate 2 random bytes per object per frame. reply teo_zero 9 hours agorootparentInteresting. I know this is a purely academic question as these constraints are something of the past, but was it really necessary to have 16 bits for the velocity? Was the ratio between the quickest and the slowest objects more than 256 times? reply kevin_thibedeau 3 hours agorootparentOn 8-bit micros without a barrel shifter you'd naturally want to constrain number formats to byte boundaries. Much better to have excess fractional precision than deal with extra bit twiddling.

This is exactly what you are loosing when using fadd_fast: fine control over the errors terms of floating point operations that do matter in a lot of cases. An other thing you are loosing is reproducibility: depending on the machine, compiler version, etc, your program will compute differently and for example may switch from linear to quadratic errors terms when you recompile.

Not sure if rust supports them though. reply clausecker 7 hours agorootparentYou don't get SIMD with this approach though, so it's about a quarter of the speed of using vectorized arithmetic (assuming an AVX vector of doubles). reply bee_rider 19 hours agorootparentprevDoes rust have float128 support? This is probably memory bound anyway, so software (rather than hardware) support might be fine(?). reply LegionMammal978 18 hours agorootparentNo, it doesn't. Regardless, without hardware support, adding together intermediate f128s would basically be the same as Kahan summation, except performing even more work to convert the representations around. reply zokier 12 hours agorootparentThere is some support behind feature flag: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.f128.html reply kardos 17 hours agoprevWhy is pairwise summation 1/5th as fast as naive? I would expect these to be essentially the same speed, there is only one more addition and a logic operation which is surely negligible .. reply pixelesque 17 hours agoparentIt's a lot more asm instructions than the tight loop of the naive one, as it's got to track more state (working out the middle of the slice, etc)... https://godbolt.org/z/917o7oT8r reply kardos 17 hours agorootparentAha. So it could be optimized into two tight loops. The linked wikipedia on pairwise says the numpy implementation is same speed as naive reply orlp 10 hours agorootparentNumpy also uses blocked pairwise summation, with a block size of 128: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/a6e9dc7152098182b45ecd6e... . reply kardos 17 hours agoprevHow does it compare to converting each number to a large fixed-point integer (implemented as N 64-bit integers), summing them with exact integer math (order-invariant), and converting back to floating point at the end? The sum part can be done with AVX-512 [1] if N=8, and N=8 is probably enough for a lot of real world summations. The conversion back to floating point at the end is only done once so not very costly. The conversion to fixed point is probably the worst part. Is there a faster way to do it than a loop that extracts one 64-bit integer per iteration? If not we could convert several input numbers at a time with SIMD. But it would be nifty to be able to convert one double to N integers with SIMD instead of a loop. [1] http://www.numberworld.org/y-cruncher/internals/addition.htm... reply moonchild 16 hours agoparentsee xsum https://gitlab.com/radfordneal/xsum reply kardos 55 minutes agorootparentThanks! Yes this is exactly it. Interesting about the choice of 32 bits for carries. N=67 is pretty high. I suspect N could be tuned down significantly depending on the problem. Eg global sums in geophysics models -- the range of values being summed does not span the full double range. But that would require analysis to decide about, while the full sized superaccumulator works directly. I wonder how it stacks up in terms of performance w/r/t the methods in the blog post reply zokier 12 hours agoparentprevN=5 should cover easily single precision float range. Doubles are more tricky, you'd need N=33 reply kardos 51 minutes agorootparentAgree if we need exact for any range of inputs. It should be possible to get by with fewer for real life problems, for ex, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S01678... reply RhysU 8 hours agoprevA extension of the article showing the impact of pathological input for each algorithm would be interesting. reply DeathArrow 12 hours agoprevUse doubles, use Kahan summation, use 2Sum algo, use larger precision floating point library? reply janwas 56 minutes agoparent+1 for TwoSum [1]. To expand on that: Kahan summation is an approximation which is a bit cheaper, but not great if some inputs can also be negative. That's because it is basically FastTwoSum(a,b) in a loop, which only works if the exponent of a >= that of b. TwoSum removes this requirement and is not that much more expensive. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2Sum reply floxy 17 hours agoprevSeems like there is a rust priority queue (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/binary_heap/index....). Would be interesting to see a version where you pop off the two smallest values, and push the sum back, until there is only one element left. reply aardvark179 17 hours agoparentThat works just great if your numbers are positive, but if they are both positive and negative, and in almost but not quite equal pairings it will fail to give the best answer even if you prioritise by magnitude. reply recursive 3 hours agorootparentIf it works for positives, then you can add all the positives in one bin, add all the negatives in one bin, and finish off with a single subtraction. reply caturopath 20 hours agoprevThe motivating example is a mess. 15_000_000 would have been a less distracting example, as this one has more-visible problems unrelated to the problem they're trying to solve. (Further, with default options, the opening example won't have the result shown: it will crash your program.) reply orlp 20 hours agoparentI don't follow. Why is 15_000_000 less distracting? What problems unrelated to what we're trying to solve? And what 'default options' are you referring to? reply exmadscientist 19 hours agorootparentThe motivating examples read like nonsense to me. (I don't really speak Rust, but I think I'm reading them correctly? I don't know.) They seem to be saying that 1 + 1,000,000 = 1,000,000; or 1 + 100,000,000 is 16,777,216? With no remark? That's not right even for 32-bit floats. reply orlp 19 hours agorootparentvec![1.0; 1_000_000_000] is Rust notation for an array that contains 1.0 one billion times. I can understand it's a bit confusing/frustrating if you're unfamiliar with Rust syntax, sorry. reply exmadscientist 19 hours agorootparentThat makes things make a lot more sense, thanks! Kind of unfortunate that that syntax is so trivial to misread, but it is what it is. reply caturopath 17 hours agorootparentprevSorry, I misread the ; as a ,. reply screcth 19 hours agoprevYou could also use SIMD to compute N independent Kahan sums in parallel and reduce them at the end. reply orlp 19 hours agoparentI tried this, it was the same speed as orlp_sum with worse accuracy. reply RhysU 8 hours agorootparentHow was the final reduction performed? Also Kahan? reply orlp 8 hours agorootparentYes, although to be fair I did discard the c values for the final reduction I perhaps should've incorporated somehow. The code from the blog post is all on Github, feel free to try and add/benchmark it yourself: https://github.com/orlp/sum-bench/. reply rwmj 11 hours agoprev [‚Äì] Isn't sorting (smallest first) then summing another method, distinct from the ones given? reply anonymoushn 5 hours agoparent [‚Äì] If you're going to do something like this, it seems like the TFA's suggestion of bucketizing by exponent and having one accumulator per exponent is cheaper (it doesn't require you to sort \"all the way\") and more correct (e.g. the input of a billion 1s was already sorted, but naively computing the sum gave an incorrect result). reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
