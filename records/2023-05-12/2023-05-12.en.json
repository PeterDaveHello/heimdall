Some argue that these tools are useless for highly skilled writers and coders, while others see them as useful for beginners and non-experts. The debate also touches on the potential loss of skills due to automation, the impact of immaterial entertainment on society, and the role of capitalism in income inequality. Despite the mixed opinions, several users acknowledge the impressive technical achievement of AI writing tools.Users discuss the usefulness of AI language models like ChatGPT for tasks such as writing, coding, and troubleshooting.\nSome argue that these tools provide valuable assistance for beginners or non-specialists.\nOthers worry that relying too heavily on such tools will hinder learning.\nOne user points out that these tools are most useful for basic or common tasks; more complicated or specialized tasks still require human expertise.\nDespite some mixed opinions, users generally agree that these tools are currently valuable, but caution that they should not replace or shortcut the learning process.Users discuss the uses and limitations of language models like GPT-4, including their potential for helping with tedious or difficult tasks like email writing, tweet crafting, and code refactoring. Some users find them incredibly useful, particularly when it comes to producing output quickly and automating unnecessary manual work. Others note that they can struggle with more complex or nuanced tasks or produce outputs that require careful scrutiny or correcting errors. It is important to understand the limits and possibilities of language models like GPT-4 and use them in conjunction with human intelligence in order to achieve optimal results.ChatGPT is a useful tool for finding information that is beyond human abilities in terms of speed and knowledge. It's great for tasks like searching for vague information and language translation. Evaluating the capability of LLMs vs Humans, LLMs must answer without being able to iterate, backtrack, or use tools. GPT-4 is super-human in terms of general knowledge and language translation abilities. ChatGPT functions as a sparring partner that helps with organizing ideas, rephrasing thoughts, and solving minor issues while working on a project. It can also be used to find information that is difficult to locate on search engines. However, it's not yet revolutionary and should be used for what it's good at rather than a one-stop solution for all tasks.The post is a discussion thread on the usefulness of a variety of AI-powered writing assistants, such as Copilot and ChatGPT. Some find these tools useful for generating prompts and boilerplate code, while others argue that relying too heavily on them can hinder true writing and creative thinking. The thread also includes a tangent on different personas and their preferred communication styles, as well as a quote from Plato on the dangers of relying too much on external marks rather than personal memory. Overall, the post provides insights into different perspectives on the role of AI in writing and creativity.A discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of writing using modern tools and AI arose on HackerNews. This led to a debate about the role of the written word, memory, and tradition in shaping our understanding of ideas. Some argued that writing is a powerful way to change oneself and to shape the world. While others suggested that writing tools, including AI, save time and help with phrasing. There was also a comparison between oral and written traditions, with some pointing out the loss of well-trained memory skills that came with the shift from oral traditions. Despite this, it was considered that the growth of the written word provided benefits for social exchange and communication. The conversation even touched on religious traditions and how they evolved from oral to written forms over time.The post discusses the relationship between memory, writing, and the brain. The commenters draw parallels with computer memory levels and caching performance impacts, emphasizing the importance of having core information readily accessible in low-latency memory (the brain). They argue that strong memory is an indicator of exceptional skill and that memory recall through verbal tradition has historical significance. The debate highlights the benefits and limitations of writing for storage versus writing for thinking and emphasizes that the brain's ability to process and recall information is complex and not entirely clear cut. The commenters suggest that writing helps with meaningful communication and can lead to improved thinking, especially when used to reflect on concepts.No meaningful content in raw text.People reflect on the effect technology has on memory and critical thinking. Some compare today's increasing reliance on smartphones as an external memory with the Greek philosopher Plato's criticism of writing, which could have made individuals think less and rely more on the written word. While some believe that not having to memorize information enables people to use their time better towards other tasks, others argue that understanding and critical thinking are more important than memorization. The discussion touches on the role of writing, AI, oral traditions, and how different media influence the philosophy it represents. Some also raise points about Socrates\u2019 warnings against trusting written words over understanding and experience.",

This means businesses can now submit hundreds of pages of materials for Claude to digest and analyze, and conversations with Claude can go on for hours or even days.The average person can read 100,000 tokens of text in ~5+ hours[1], and then they might need substantially longer to digest, remember, and analyze that information. Claude can now do this in less than a minute. For example, we loaded the entire text of The Great Gatsby into Claude-Instant (72K tokens) and modified one line to say Mr. Carraway was \u201ca software engineer that works on machine learning tooling at Anthropic.\u201d When we asked the model to spot what was different, it responded with the correct answer in 22 seconds.Beyond just reading long texts, Claude can help retrieve information from the documents that help your business run. You can drop multiple documents or even a book into the prompt and then ask Claude questions that require synthesis of knowledge across many parts of the text. For complex questions, this is likely to work substantially better than vector search based approaches. Claude can follow your instructions and return what you\u2019re looking for, as a human assistant would!Our partners are excited about what larger context windows means for their business. 100K translates into roughly 6 hours of audio - AssemblyAI put out a great demonstration of this where they transcribed a long podcast into 58K words and then used Claude for summarization and Q&A. You can watch the full demo here. With 100K context windows, you can:Digest, summarize, and explain dense documents like financial statements or research papersAnalyze strategic risks and opportunities for a company based on its annual reportsAssess the pros and cons of a piece of legislationIdentify risks, themes, and different forms of argument across legal documents.Read through hundreds of pages of developer documentation and surface answers to technical questionsRapidly prototype by dropping an entire codebase into the context and intelligently build on or modify it100K context windows are now available in our API.

        "hn_content": "A Hacker News thread discusses the limitations of large-context language models such as GPT-4 in identifying differences in a document, noting the need for modeling reasoning capacity over the document length. AI tools are more effective for identifying differences within a limited topic domain and can work with only the text that is relevant to the question. Users have reported success in using LLMs for identifying plot holes and open plot threads in their own writing, though they need to guide the context appropriately. Researchers advise using vector databases for more complex text-deduction tasks. The discussion also raises limitations in the development of AI models and the need for domain-specific guidance in model training.Anthropic's new language model, Claude, is capable of analyzing context windows of up to 100,000 tokens, making it much larger than OpenAI's GPT-3 model. Users are exploring how the model can help with \"spell checking\" at a semantic level, character sheet creation for writers, and creating character sheets for use in novel writing. Some users express skepticism, saying that doing more than what a human can do is not necessarily impressive, and others suggest areas of improvement such as price, customization, integration, and safety features. Open source models are also seen as important for prompt engineering and model upgrades, but may be limited in scope for large businesses.A discussion on the relevance of open-source AI models reveals that the quality of completions is the most important factor. It is posited that Open Source AI (OSS AI) will offer more diverse and useful services than proprietary offerings, with lower vendor lock-in, and aid privacy compliance concerns of enterprises. It is noted that the utility of OSS for personal use cases may be overblown, but is relevant for privacy concerns and cost-effectiveness for commercial use. There is optimism that advancements in hardware can bring down costs of high-end systems. The need for faster, cheaper fine-tuning and training remains a priority. It is suggested that open-source models could succeed as the \"Linux of LLMs\", leading to price competition for different providers of the model.OpenAI's Claude is said to be gaining ground in the large language model (LLM) chatbot competition, putting an end to OpenAI's lead since the release of ChatGPT in December 2022. Claude, which is available through API and can produce quality outputs in a single query with much faster response time, is seen as a worthy competitor to ChatGPT. In addition, Google has made its language models available through Google Cloud, and other services like Anthropic Instant have emerged as competitors to GPT4. While LLMs are becoming increasingly important for a variety of tasks, some are turning to using local hard drives to avoid unnecessary calls to the internet and to improve the software performance.Anthropic, an AI research lab, has pushed the limits of language models by building a new model, \"Claude,\" with a context window of 100K tokens. This represents a significant increase from GPT-3's 2048 tokens context limit and GPT-4's proposed 32K limit. The new model is trained only in the decoding direction, dropping the traditional encoder part of the transformer architecture. This improves performance while lowering computational costs, making it relatively cheaper for tasks that require larger context windows. However, many researchers argue that having such a massive context window is unnecessary for most use cases, and it may not always provide the best performance. Though, Anthropic suggests some compelling use cases such as accurately answering questions about a single lengthy document and chatbots that can remember conversations from months ago.Anthropic, an AI research startup, has released Claude, an advanced large language model (LLM) that can process a larger context window of up to 100,000 tokens, significantly more than existing LLMs. The ability to handle a large context is important for improving AI language capabilities. However, there is a debate on\u00a0the optimum way to balance context limitations with prompts, with some arguing that optimizing prompts is just as important. Meanwhile, ChatGPT faces problems of consistency and trimming down instructions when context grows. Claude is available for free through the Poe app. There are no clear benchmarks to compare its long-context performances to other LLMs.",

The app processes sensationalist articles by utilizing OpenAI's language models. Two developers working on the project highlighted issues with photo captions, and a possible solution suggested was to utilize a news API. The problem with media organizations distorting news for better performance was also acknowledged. While news outlets can often be biased, some developers argued that an AI news agency may tackle this issue. Users may need time to tune their brains to a low-sensationalism diet as the main issue for big news outlets is coverage bias.The article discusses the role of bias in news reporting and how it affects our perception of the world. It emphasizes the importance of finding a balance in news consumption and being pragmatic. The comments suggest various ways to remove bias from news reporting, including using AI and algorithms to summarize news and translate it into plain English. One commenter discusses a news feed processor that ranks news based on the number of publishers talking about it. Another suggests presenting a time-lagged newsfeed and using AI to link to follow-up stories. The article and comments offer ideas on how to consume news in a pragmatic and unbiased way.Boring Report, a new app that uses AI language models to summarize news articles into neutral, factual, and less sensationalized bullet points, has garnered attention on Hacker News. Users have praised the app's ability to filter out \"click-bait\" headlines and allow them to access useful information without being distracted by sensationalism. Some commenters questioned the effectiveness of using AI to summarize news, while others suggested that the app's approach could be a stepping stone towards more informed reading habits. Others suggested that there may be a market for \"boring\" news that is less sensationalized and biased than current news outlets. Users also shared similar apps and tools that take the same approach to filtering out sensationalized content.Users of the newly launched Boring Report app are leaving feedback on the thread at Hacker News. The app is designed to provide a less sensationalist and more straightforward approach to news stories. Despite some criticism for being a mobile-only app, which turned some people away, users have praised its summarization ability and no-nonsense attitude. Suggestions from users included the implementation of RSS and localization features, and a tool to detect and color-code manipulative verbiage in stories. Some also believed that the app could serve to combat biased political media by presenting less biased news stories.The Boring Report is an app that uses AI to \"de-sensationalize\" news titles, removing language designed to trigger subcortical responses. Users wonder how the app works, and some say that rewording the headlines is not enough to determine if news is fake or not. Others suggest a slider bar to normalize headlines, highlights to filter news, and a plugin that reads articles and replaces headlines with the lead. Users also suggest a rating system to determine the level of sensationalism and to provide a robust summary below each article. Some worry that the app may narrow the Overton window, but others appreciate the approach to tackle biased news.The Boring Report aims to provide a concise summary of news articles that contain sensationalized headlines and content. It uses OpenAI's language models to change the articles into easily digestible and fact-based content. The tool reduces incentives for clickbaity headlines but cannot change the content of news, which requires adjustments to journalistic motivations. The tool needs work to remove bias. The LM could be trained to identify and highlight lies and deceptions in news articles. The format could be modified to allow for red marking of false statements, purple for appeals to emotions, and green for appeals to authority.

Other developers replied, essentially agreeing with those points and discussing some of the downsides of using more complex languages like JavaScript. They also discussed the tradeoffs of using frameworks like Laravel, which can be productive but also a bit bloated and brittle.Developers discuss the pros and cons of using frameworks such as Laravel, Rails, and Django. While frameworks can be a force multiplier for building a specific type of application, deviating from that mold can make the framework a hindrance. Some developers argue that building a custom in-house framework or tying together numerous libraries can be a better alternative. However, others disagree, asserting that frameworks like Laravel are battle-tested and can cover most obvious issues and use cases. PHP, which has matured into an almost decent language, has faced reputational issues due to naive developers believing that the simplest solution is always the most correct, thus implementing unsafe SQL and escaping practices. Despite these criticisms, some developers find PHP's flexibility and availability of web tools appealing.Developers discuss the merits of PHP as a language and the quality of its documentation, with some criticizing the language for being bloated and others finding it useful and pleasant to work with. While Laravel is acknowledged to have reasonably good documentation, some users find it lacking in detail and difficult to navigate. Lumen is recommended as a useful alternative to Laravel for new projects, but the development team no longer recommends Lumen in favor of Laravel Octane. Some users recommend using other languages or frameworks, such as Python, Kotlin, Rust, C#, or Elixir+Phoenix, citing various reasons, including compile time quality guarantees, the messiness of the standard library, and low library quality.Some developers are frustrated with the Laravel documentation, which they say is lacking in comprehensive coverage of all its features and class methods. Others find the documentation readable and easy to understand, and recommend carefully reading it before working to avoid issues. Some also criticize the language itself, or parts of its ecosystem. The debate touches on how best to approach the technology, with opinions differing on whether looking to GitHub and Google for code snippets is a better approach than studying the documentation carefully. Meanwhile, some developers suggest that contract-based documentation could be more effective than only providing tutorials.Developers weigh in on whether PHP is a suitable language for modern web development, with some praising its ecosystem of libraries and productivity, while others think it has too many inconsistencies. Some recommend alternatives like Kotlin and Quarkus, while others suggest different frameworks for scaling apps. Debugging in PHP is discussed, with xdebug being a popular option. Laravel and Livewire are highlighted as productivity-boosting frameworks. Discussions also cover frontend development, with Livewire being recommended as a mid-way option between frontend and backend development and VueJS being recommended for full single-page applications. The design of Qbix's Platform and its license also garnered criticism.A developer criticizes the design of the Payload CMS site, citing poor text sizes, confusing button layouts, and low contrast. However, another user defends the design, stating that it is what developers prefer. The discussion also touches on the limitations of PHP with regards to memory usage, slow initialization times and deployment, compared to Go, though one user notes that PHP has improved.The comment thread discusses the performance and efficiency of PHP as compared to other languages like Go, Python, and Java. The Symfony framework is used as an example, and opinions differ on its effectiveness. Some users report success with PHP for large-scale projects, while others criticize the language's performance. The thread also touches on issues related to parallelization, cache warmup, and resource consumption. Some users suggest alternative solutions to using PHP, while others discuss workarounds and optimizations. The overall consensus is that PHP can be effective for certain use cases, but may not be the best choice in all situations.PHP developers discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the language on Hacker News. While some praise the language's recent improvements, others remain critical of its historical flaws. The community considers how to tap into the valuable domain knowledge accumulated in specialized PHP frameworks. Laravel, a PHP framework, is compared and contrasted with Ruby on Rails. Some readers criticize the overgeneralization of PHP being automatically protected against security vulnerabilities and the need for proper input validation.This post is a discussion forum with various commenters expressing their preferences and opinions on programming languages, like Ruby and PHP. Some argue for choosing a language that matches your approach to problem-solving, while others highlight the importance of secure coding practices.

This will make it easier for developers to build on the available data and create similar immersive experiences. Previously, nobody could compete with the detail and coverage of Google Earth, but now the open standard will allow others to access the same data. This could lead to more innovation and competition within the space. The open standard uses 3D Tiles format and will allow for photorealistic 3D tileset queries. While people are excited about the release, some have expressed concern about the future possibility of Google charging for the service. Additionally, developers have discussed the VR capabilities of Google Earth and what headsets they use to experience it.Google Maps has released a new feature called Aerial View API which can give software developers and businesses access to photorealistic 3D models of cities built using 3D photogrammetry from satellite and aerial imagery. More than 2500 cities\u2019 geometry data are available from the system, which is already compatible with two rendering engines, Deck.gl and Three.js. Google Maps has been criticised for image resolution when zooming in and the Aerial View API is no exception. Although appearing blurry up close, Google Earth Virtual Reality has had continual exciting updates, making the Aerial View API a useful tool for businesses and developers.\n- Apple does support GLTF format, but not with Draco compression.\n- Reality Converter app allows conversion of GLTF files to USDZ format on Apple platform. \n- Project using App Kit could potentially hackdoor open 3D immersive standards.\n- Photorealistic 3D Tiles are in the open standard glTF format.\n- Title of the post is considered misleading by some commenters.",

        "content": "Scientists Regenerate Hair Cells that Enable HearingResearchers move closer to gene therapy solution for hearing lossBy RYAN JASLOW | Mass Eye and Ear April 19, 2023 Research6 min readImage: Jun/iStock/Getty Images PlusHearing loss affects about 48 million Americans and 430 million people worldwide, with those numbers expected to grow as populations age.More than 90 percent of individuals affected have sensorineural hearing loss, caused by damage to the inner ear and the destruction of the hair cells responsible for relaying sounds to the brain.Get more HMS news hereHair cells cannot be regenerated in mammals, including humans, because unlike other cells in the body, any remaining hair cells in the inner ear cannot divide and other inner ear cells cannot convert themselves into new hair cells. Species like fish, birds, and reptiles, however, possess this ability.RELATED STORIESThe Hearing MoleculeThe exquisitely complex process of hearing begins with the opening of a tiny molecular gateReversing Hearing LossReprogramming enables regeneration of inner-ear cellsEstimating Hidden Hearing LossNew word-score model leads to better evaluations of cochlear nerve damageHidden Hearing Loss RevealedTwo biomarkers of brain function can measure the ability to follow conversations in noisy environmentsFor this reason, effective hearing loss treatments for humans have eluded medicine, and the loss of hair cells, which can be caused by aging, noise exposure, and other factors, renders an individual\u2019s hearing loss permanent.\u00adNow, Harvard Medical School scientists at Mass Eye and Ear are hopeful they\u2019ve developed a solution to address this longstanding limitation.A research team led by Zheng-Yi Chen, an HMS associate professor of otolaryngology and associate scientist in the Eaton-Peabody Laboratories at Mass Eye and Ear, reported creating a drug-like cocktail of different molecules that successfully regenerated hair cells in a mouse model by reprogramming a series of genetic pathways within the inner ear.The researchers hope their novel findings, published April 17 in PNAS, could one day pave the way for clinical trials for a gene therapy that can be administered to people with hearing loss.\u201cThese findings are extremely exciting because throughout the history of the hearing loss field, the ability to regenerate hair cells in an inner ear has been the holy grail,\u201d said Chen. \u201cWe now have a drug-like cocktail that shows the feasibility of an approach that we can explore for future clinical applications.\u201dNew approach to achieve hearing loss treatmentPreviously, Chen\u2019s research team studied zebrafish and chickens to uncover which pathways were responsible for inducing the cell division required to regenerate new hair cells. They discovered that two molecular signaling pathways, \u00ad\u00ad, were crucial to this process.In a study published in 2019, the team showed for the first time that when these pathways were activated in adult transgenic mice, remaining inner ear cells could divide and develop characteristics of hair cells.The new cells contained transduction channels that relay sound signals and the ability to form connections with auditory neurons \u2014 processes essential to hearing.Trusted health and wellness informationFrom Harvard Health PublishingSign up for our free HealthBeat newsletterWhile an exciting discovery at the time, such an approach was not directly translatable to people, according to Chen. Unlike transgenic mice, humans cannot have Myc and Notch pathways turned on like a light switch.A drug therapy, he explained, would have to be introduced to the inner ear to activate the Myc and Notch pathways.Previous studies have shown that a chemical compound called valproic acid can activate Notch, however, no molecule exists to effectively activate Myc. That led the researchers to instead look for drug molecules that can alter the downstream pathways that turn on and off when Myc is activated.Through single-cell RNA sequencing, they discovered that activating Myc and Notch led to a downstream effect in which two other pathways, Wnt and cAMP, became activated. Importantly, they found chemical compounds that can directly activate Wnt and cAMP.They then used small biological molecules called small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to remove genes downstream that suppressed the activation of the Myc pathway.\u201cThink about a brake when driving a car,\u201d explained Chen. \u201cIf the brake is always engaged, you can\u2019t drive. We found an siRNA that could remove the brake in this genetic pathway.\u201dThe researchers then combined the chemical compounds and siRNA molecules into a drug-like cocktail. They delivered it to the inner ear of a normal adult mouse with damaged hair cells \u2014 an important distinction, as wild-type, non-transgenic mice would be more translatable to humans.They further delivered the gene Atoh1 by a gene therapy approach that utilizes a harmless adenovirus into the cocktail-treated inner ear.Remarkably, they found this drug-like cocktail combined with adenovirus turned on Myc and Notch, which led to the regeneration of new hair cells. They verified that the hair cells were functional through advanced imaging and other techniques.Regenerating hair cells through gene therapy approachStudies like Chen\u2019s show the promise of gene therapy for treating incurable conditions like hearing loss. Last year, this research project was selected out of hundreds as one of the Disruptive Dozen gene and cell therapy technologies most likely to have a significant impact on health care over the next several years at the Mass General Brigham World Medical Innovation Forum.Mass General Brigham recently launched its Gene and Cell Therapy Institute to help translate scientific discoveries made by researchers like Chen into first-in-human clinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients.The researchers are conducting ongoing studies and refinements to this treatment approach in larger animal models, which are necessary before applying to initiate clinical trials.They note that more research is needed to address limitations and challenges for delivering a treatment to the inner ear.Scientists are examining different gene therapy and surgical methods, including an approach previously honed at Mass Eye and Ear, in which a different viral vector called an adeno-associated virus (AAV) was able to precisely and safely deliver gene therapy to the inner ear through a novel surgery.Similar AAV-surgical approaches are currently used at Mass Eye and Ear in approved and experimental drug therapies for patients with inherited retinal disorders that can lead to blindness.\u201cMy colleagues and I frequently are contacted by people with hearing loss who are desperate for effective treatments,\u201d said Chen. \u201cIf we can combine a surgical procedure with a refined gene therapy delivery method, we hope we can achieve our number one goal of bringing a new treatment into the clinic.\u201dAuthorship, funding, disclosuresCo-authors of the study include Yizhou Quan, Wei Wei, Volkan Ergin, PhD, Arun Prabhu Rameshbabu, Mingqian Huang, ChunJie Tian, Srinivas Vinod Saladi, and Artur Indzhykulian, of Mass Eye and Ear.This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH grants R01DC006908, R01DC016875, R56DC006908, UG3TR002636, and R01DC017166), the Department of Defense (DOD grants W81XWH1810331, W81XWH2110957), the Fredrick and Ines Yeatts hair cell regeneration fellowship, Harvard Catalyst Translational Innovator Program The Five Senses, and the Mike Toth Head and Neck Cancer Center.Chen is a co-founder and a SAB member of Salubritas Therapeutics, which is developing treatments for hearing loss including genome editing, inner ear regeneration, novel delivery, and gene therapy, and has ownership of over 5 percent equity.

Hair cells are essential to hearing, and immaturity and unstable long-term survival have been limiting factors for clinical applications. The researchers found a drug-like cocktail of molecules to successfully regenerate hair cells, but the mouse model study is several steps away from restoring hearing in adult deaf animal models. The hair cells are considered a second priority as compared to neurons connecting the auditory nerve and hair cell via spiral ganglion cell loss. No current method can reconnect these neurons or regrow spiral ganglion cells, but researchers have begun exploring drugs and other ways to regenerate hearing. Funding remains scarce in the field even as steady progress continues.Researchers are attempting to regenerate hair cells to restore hearing in people suffering from hearing loss. In a study published in the scientific journal Cell Reports, researchers revealed signs of hair cell regeneration in animals, using a specialised drug injection called FX-322. The drug triggers progenitor cells, known to develop hair cells in the ear, by enabling them to differentiate into hair cells. The researchers noted that the regenerated hair cells exhibited \u201cbiophysical properties similar to those observed in developing hair cells\u201d.

One commenter notes they no longer find passive entertainment fulfilling and prefer to be productive or learn new things instead.Many people are feeling unfulfilled by always being productive and are seeking other ways to spend their time, including exercise, reading, and learning. This may be due to the influence of corporate culture or the pressure to constantly improve oneself. Some suggest finding ways to be productive that are personally fulfilling, such as pursuing a passion project. Others advocate for a four-day workweek to allow for more time for personal tasks and projects. Some criticize the concept of productivity as oversimplified and unhealthy. The book \"Pathless Path\" is recommended for those looking to reevaluate their values around work. People should prioritize their wellbeing and find a balance between productivity and leisure.",

        "content": "Press release issued: 11 May 2023As the cost of living continues to spiral, a new report shows more than half of gig economy workers in the UK are paid below the minimum wage.The first-of-its-kind study, led by the University of Bristol, found 52% of gig workers doing jobs ranging from data entry to food delivery were earning below the minimum wage. On average respondents were earning \u00a38.97 per hour \u2013 around 15% below the current UK minimum wage, which rose to \u00a310.42 this month.More than three-quarters (76%) of survey respondents also experienced work-related insecurity and anxiety.Lead author Dr Alex Wood, Senior Lecturer in Human Resource Management and Future of Work at the University of Bristol Business School, said: \"The findings highlight that working in the UK gig economy often entails low pay, anxiety, and stress. As food, fuel and housing costs keep rising, this group of workers are especially vulnerable and need to be more adequately remunerated and better protected.\"Equally concerning, more than a quarter (28%) felt they were risking their health or safety in doing gig work and a quarter (25%) experienced pain on the job.When asked what would improve their situation, basic rights such as minimum wage rates, holiday and sick pay, and protection against unfair dismissal were most wanted.Unions and platform councils (similar to works councils that exist in some European countries) to represent their needs and help influence how gig economy platforms operate and affect their working conditions also featured on their wish list. More than three-quarters of respondents believed the introduction of such bodies would bring immediate benefits.Dr Wood said: \"A major factor contributing to low pay rates is that this work involves spending significant amounts of time waiting or looking for work while logged on to a platform. Not only is the work low paid, but it is also extremely insecure and risky.\"The self-employed who are dependent on platforms to make a living are urgently in need of labour protections to shield them against the huge power asymmetries that exist in the sector. This clearly warrants the expansion of the current \u2018worker\u2019 status to protect them.\"The study involved 510 UK gig economy workers who were surveyed last year. There was representation from across the sector, with around half being remote freelancers using platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr to pick up jobs ranging from data entry to website design. The other half comprised local drivers providing food delivery and taxi services via platforms including Deliveroo and Uber.More than just side hustles to earn extra cash, respondents spent on average 28 hours a week undertaking gig work, comprising 60% of their total earnings.Respondents overwhelmingly considered their work to be best described as self-employment and thought an extension of labour rights to include the self-employed would significantly improve their working lives.This was the first research to investigate what forms of voice gig workers want. The findings suggest strong support for European style co-determination whereby worker representatives are consulted on and approve changes that impact working conditions and employment. Works councils that exist in countries like Germany could therefore provide a model for platform councils and assemblies in the gig economy to facilitate workers having a say over the decisions which affect their ability to make a living.Brendan Burchell, Professor in Social Sciences at the University of Cambridge and co-author of the report, added: \"Respondents strongly felt the creation of co-determination mechanisms would allow workers, and their representatives, to influence platform provider decisions which could instantly improve their working lives.\"These policies include elected bodies of worker representatives approving all major platform changes that impact jobs and working conditions. Our findings emphasise the potential for trade union growth in this sector, with majorities being willing to join and even organise such bodies.\"",
        "summary": "- The majority of gig economy workers, such as Uber and Lyft drivers, are earning below the minimum wage in the United States, according to a study by the University of California, Berkeley.\n- The study found that after taking into account expenses such as insurance, maintenance, and gas, gig workers were earning far less than the minimum wage in their respective states.\n- The findings raise concerns about the exploitation of gig economy workers and the need for more stringent labor regulations to protect their rights and ensure fair wages.",
