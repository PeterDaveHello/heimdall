They give you some money to help you start your business, and they promise you access to a community of people that can help you along the way. In exchange, they only ask for a small amount of equity. Doesn’t sound that bad, no? But by the end of this post I will convince you that it’s actually a terrible idea. https://x.com/ycombinator/status/1711743742636425546 ERGODICITY First, you have to understand a very important concept: in some systems, what’s best for a group is not necessarily what’s best for the individuals who make up the group. In other words, the total wealth of a group of people could be increasing, while almost everyone making up that group could be seeing their wealth diminish. When this happens, we say we have a non-ergodic system. If the system was ergodic, what’s happening to the collective would also translate to all individuals. Silicon Valley is a non-ergodic industry (like Hollywood, book publishing, the music industry, and even your country’s economy unless you’re under full-blown communism.) A non-ergodic system is not necessarily bad, but if you’re not cognizant of the system you’re in, you’re going to be played like a fiddle. Those who benefit from the collective will take advantage of you, while you (as the individual) lose out. This is what YC will try to do to you. In fact, this is what YC has to do; otherwise it won’t survive. Let me explain. LOOKING FOR TREASURE Imagine you’re told there’s a bunch of hidden treasures within a 100 acre area. What’s the best strategy for finding some of these treasures? One way is to pick a spot, and dedicate your entire life digging as far down as possible on that one spot. You might reason that the deeper the treasure, the bigger the loot. You don’t want to settle for a measly small treasure box. You want the full chest of diamonds buried near the end of the earth’s crust. This is your shot at glory. Another way is to use a search method employed by search and rescue teams. You divide the area into small squares, and do a “reasonable search” in each one. You use probabilities and some common sense to help guide you how deep to dig, and then you move to the next square. If you encounter undisturbed compacted dirt, chances are there’s no treasure beneath. If you run into bedrock, it’s almost certain there’s nothing below. So you use that information and move on. Your goal is to search the entire area where there’s probable treasure as quickly as possible. Ideally within your lifetime. I’m sure you agree with me that the first way is a dumb strategy. Almost every digger employing this strategy will die treasure-less. But actually, it’s only dumb for that individual treasure hunter. For a gold mining company, this is the optimal strategy. The company only needs one miner to hit jackpot, and all the other miners can die penniless. If the cost of sacrificing an individual treasure hunter is low, the most optimal strategy is to get tens of thousands of treasure hunters, allocate hundreds of them per acre, and make them dig all the way down to the earth’s core. The treasure hunting economy would grow much bigger than if all the individual treasure hunters were optimizing for their own self-interest. So, digging in one spot is a dumb strategy for the economy of the individual, but a very wise strategy for the collective economy of all individuals. This is what happens in a non-ergodic system. We often hear politicians claim that the GDP is growing, but all the gains are going to the 1%. This is the same thing. The wealth of a country could be growing, but almost all the citizens could be getting poorer. There’s nothing inconsistent with this. The average is simply being dragged up by the freak outliers. The same thing happens in venture capital. The owners of the portfolio maximize their returns when the system is non-ergodic, because while the individual treasure hunter has one lifetime to strike gold, the VC portfolio has access to thousands of lifetimes: those of all the treasure hunters. PLANE CRASH YC will proudly tell you that you are more likely to end up with a billion dollar business if you join them. That may be true. What they’re more reluctant to tell you is that only about 50 companies met that expectation out of the 4,000 or so that went through their program. That’s 1.25%. To be fair, that’s actually quite impressive, but let’s say you have the stamina and willpower to go through YC three times in your lifetime. You’d need approximately 26 lifetimes to hit the jackpot! Aha! See the problem now? I don’t know about you, but I want to be successful in this lifetime. I can't afford to rely on 26 lifetimes. But maybe you think you’re special. You’re not like those 3,950 dummies who failed. Maybe you are in fact special, but I wouldn’t rely too much on that. Business is much more random than it seems. If business was predictable, YC wouldn't have a measly 1.25% success rate, or thereabouts. You might think that those who failed might still have gotten something. Maybe. But failure is a very expensive way to learn those things. You don’t need to crash a plane to learn how to fly one. And whatever lessons are learned from going through YC are probably not very useful anyway, but more on that later. PIVOTS ARE STUPID One of the bad learnings you get from YC is that there’s a formula for success, and it looks like this: First you do some brainstorming. Then you come up with a good idea that can scale to a billion dollars (otherwise what’s the point of getting out of bed in the morning?) Then you work hard until you find “product-market-fit.” And then if the noises from investors indicate you won’t be getting a next round of funding, you start looking for a “pivot.” This so-called formula is nonsense. First, good ideas rarely come to us from a brainstorming session. They come from wandering about with an open mind until we stumble on an opportunity worth pursuing. Most of your ideas will be bad ideas, because unfortunately you’re not a genius visionary. So the best way to find good ideas is to have many ideas, try them out, take what works, and throw away the rest. But this is not what YC wants you to do. YC wants you to pick an idea that has market pull (or the potential for it), and to then dig a hole in the same spot until you reach the boiling magma. Because what if you stop digging just before you strike gold? When you’re cheap and expandable, that’s not an optimal strategy for the YC fund. You must go all in. Diversification is for your YC overlords, not for you. https://x.com/paulg/status/1384790166536085504 If you reach the magma layer and you still have nothing, then you’d be encouraged to pivot. But that’s not how you find business opportunities in the real world. You can’t just say I’m going to pivot, and suddenly a good opportunity lands on your lap from heaven. You get good ideas by embracing randomness for a long time, until something looks like it has a fighting chance of paying off. The pivot idea you were forced to come up with is extremely unlikely to be one. Your imagination is overrated. The YC execs didn’t imagine Stripe or Dropbox or AirBnb. Random things come to them during demo days. The YC folks are smart because they know their imagination is limited. And so should you. You can’t just pivot a business idea. And if you’re going to cherry pick some pivot that worked out of the thousands attempted, you should stop reading now. Just go join YC. The second bad lesson from YC is the focus on the upside. But if there’s any formula for success in business, it’s to focus relentlessly on staying in the game rather than on hitting it big. Focus on the downside, and let the upside take care of itself. To thrive, you must first survive. To win the race, you must finish the race. And so on. But this is in tension with what YC wants you to do. They want you to dig deep to the middle of the earth, and if you don’t come back alive, tough luck. You were a brave soldier, but now it’s time for them to focus on the other 999 soldiers. YC is still alive, but you’re not. Don’t be a dummy. Don’t be a bet in somebody else’s portfolio. BUT YOU JUST WANT TO SELL YOUR COURSE!!! Ahahaha, you caught me! It’s true. I do have something to sell you. I run a community for small-time entrepreneurs who are satisfied with reliably attainable mediocre success. The YC folks feel sorry for our joy with mediocrity while they’re out there changing the world. And we reciprocate the emotion. So yes, I am promoting something that goes against everything YC stands for. But if you think YC is not also selling you something, I have a bridge to sell you. But maybe I’m being a bit too harsh. Because what is it that YC is selling you exactly? Me, I charge you a one-time payment of $245, and you get access to my community, which includes live workshops, recorded classes, a group chat, and a few other things. It’s very clear what I’m doing. I ask for some money in exchange for access, and those who give me the money get access. Even my 6 year old kid understands it. But YC is not asking you for money. They actually give you money! It looks like you’re the one selling to them. You’re technically selling them a piece of your business, no? No, no, no, hold on. The easiest way to see what YC is selling is to look at military recruitment. The military sells the narrative that serving your country is a noble endeavor. You’ll get a shot at glory, and at the very least you gain some important life skills. You’ll also get paid enough to feed yourself and cover your basic needs, but barely. The military wants to recruit expendable soldiers who will go out to the battlefield risking their lives and limb for the collective, while the generals with all the medals sit in an air conditioned room giving orders. YC is no different. It wants to recruit wide-eyed young founders to pick a spot on the treasure map and dig all the way down through the earth’s crust. Most of them will spend years or decades digging, and all they end up with it is a ramen lifestyle. Usually bunched up with 4 roommates in a damp San Francisco basement living on take-out ramen noodles every single day. But hey, they’re young. They’ll have time to do adult things later, like starting family or making decent money. And at the very least, they’ll gain some important life lessons and make some good connections. Think about this for a second: The most successful business owners are typically in their 40s and 50s. Why is YC full of 22 year olds? Why aren’t the 40 year old entrepreneurs taking up this incredible deal that YC is offering? YC will tell you it’s because only the 22 year old kids can be true visionaries. BULL. SHIT. You’re not a visionary. All those 4,000 kids who went into YC also thought they were visionaries, and where are they now? They’re all in the startup cemetery, except for a dozen or so who despite the low odds managed to flip 10 heads in a row. The biggest indicator YC is a bad deal is that only people who are easily duped take up these deals. UNLEARNING IS HARD The best thing I learned about business is to avoid trying to predict what will work and what won’t. YC knows this. That's why they only make small bets in thousands of businesses. But YC will try to teach you the exact opposite. Business is a lot more random than it seems. You can’t treat it like a predictable project. You need to treat it like a financial investment. Instead of investing your money, you’re investing your time and energy, which is as scarce and as precious as money (if not more). Tell me, how do you invest your money? Do you pick one amazing stock and put all your life savings on it? Of course not. You understand that finance is uncertain. What’s good today might not be good tomorrow. There are hidden risks everywhere. And even if your stock pick doesn’t go bust, the biggest gains are likely to happen elsewhere and you won’t benefit from them if you’re only exposed to one piece of equity. YC teaches you to try to be a visionary. When you fail… Oopsie! Tough luck. The fund benefits from the non-ergodic nature of the system, but you’re out years of your time. But that’s not even the worst of it. You would have been taught things that not only won’t work in the real world of business, but are counterproductive. You will have to unlearn almost everything. If you want to succeed in the real world (and within this lifetime), you need to try many small things, experiment, tinker, and build a portfolio of multiple income streams. You need to treat your time the same way you treat your brokerage account. You basically need to become a VC, but for your own ideas. To make the system ergodic, you must un-leverage yourself from going all in on one thing, and get access to many diverse income streams. The same way it’s wise to invest in a broad ETF, you should be doing the same things with your projects. YC will teach you to do the opposite, but you’ll have to unlearn all of it. And unfortunately unlearning is much harder than learning. Thanks for reading the Small Bets Newsletter! Subscribe for free to receive new posts.

Trad pub authors (and the industry itself) lambasted self-published authors on every topic from quality to them not publishing 'real' books, but it slowly dawned on everybody that self-publishing was not only possible, but easier and more profitable with more upside for a broader spectrum of writers. And the gatekeepers (the industry that hoarded and controlled the profits and distribution) were left scrambling to adjust. Weirdly, many still believe they need 'permission' from agents and trad pub houses to publish 'real' books.

Even at 250k a year, you have an asset that could change your financial life for good.If you raise VC money, the above scenarios are considered a failure.

It did take me longer to get to this point, though (about three years once I got serious).I will have spent in the very low 5 digits for lawyers, to comb through my new FOSS licenses ([1], and we&#x27;re still working on that, so they are not ready yet!) and to set up standard contracts.Beyond that, less than 5 digits for two beefy computers over that time and longer.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;yzena.com&#x2F;licenses&#x2F; reply OJFord 20 hours agorootparent> My wife is the breadwinner right now, so no missed opportunity from a steady paycheck.The missed opportunity is your second income, the one you could have working for someone else, they didn&#x27;t mean &#x27;your household does not have a steady paycheck&#x27;. reply grepLeigh 15 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a certain point where more income has diminishing returns, especially if it means someone in the household is putting off their dreams of entrepreneurship.Most people who become entrepreneurs have this itch&#x2F;calling, where they simply CAN&#x27;T do anything else (for long). Ignoring the call means living an unfulfilled life. reply OJFord 12 hours agorootparentAbsolutely, I&#x27;m not saying it was a bad decision, merely explaining what the other commenter meant by the opportunity cost. reply gavinhoward 19 hours agorootparentprevFair enough. reply dmoy 18 hours agorootparentSo missed opportunity of 3 years after tax for a programmer is probably somewhere above $100,000 and below $1,000,000. Possibly a little above $1,000,000 if your missed opportunity is at a FAANG in Some Higher Level title.You could probably get a more concrete number by multiplying your previous comp by 1.5~2x or something. reply gavinhoward 18 hours agorootparentThat would be less than $200,000.Although, I struggle to get jobs. I just don&#x27;t interview well, nor do I fit the culture of most companies.I guess the reason why I don&#x27;t see an opportunity cost is because I firmly believe I couldn&#x27;t have had a job anyway. reply lfowles 20 hours agorootparentprevWhy bespoke licenses?

(at least some of) the links from the FAQ entries to license texts appear to be broken due (presumably) to a change&#x2F;transformation from `.md` to directory path.2. It might be helpful to more clearly identify the text differences between the multiple licenses and&#x2F;or at least the FAQs to enable skipping duplicated commentary when reading. reply gavinhoward 17 hours agorootparent1. Yes, sorry. In the process of fixing those as the licenses are finalized.2. That&#x27;s a good idea, but I can&#x27;t do that in the actual license documents since I need to keep the actual licenses clean from non-license materials. Do you have any good ideas how to do that? replybko 20 hours agorootparentprevGood luck, but I don&#x27;t know many business owners who have a great work&#x2F;life balance. I don&#x27;t think it ever gets easier really. It&#x27;s like writing software. It&#x27;s never \"complete\". 500k revenue doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of room for outsourcing work reply thesuitonym 19 hours agorootparent>500k revenue doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of room for outsourcing workIf you keep your business small, there&#x27;s not much need to outsource work. In software circles, it&#x27;s easy to think you can just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger, because it&#x27;s so easy to scale, but if you keep things small, a business really only needs to make enough money to keep the person running it fed and comfortable enough that they can do the work they enjoy. reply gavinhoward 20 hours agorootparentprevYou are absolutely right.The key for me is to reduce tech debt before I release. If I&#x27;m not dealing with tech debt, the actual programming shrinks, and I have time to deal with the other stuff. reply mtlynch 20 hours agorootparent>The key for me is to reduce tech debt before I release.Also an indie founder, and I&#x27;ve had the opposite experience.Early on, I focused a lot on elegant code that would minimize my maintenance burden long-term. Then I read Rob Walling&#x27;s book, Start Small, Stay Small,[0] and he talked about how programmers are typically afraid of ever taking on tech debt because they&#x27;ve been in orgs that don&#x27;t allow them to ever pay down tech debt. As an indie founder, you can pay down tech debt whenever you want.I&#x27;ve found it more useful to accrue tech debt early on in a new project or feature because it&#x27;s likely that the product will fail or that I won&#x27;t end up having to touch the feature for years.Every time I have to work on code that has tech debt, I pay down the tech debt a bit, so eventually the parts of my codebase that see the most change are the most flexible and maintainable. But a lot of my code has tech debt in ways that don&#x27;t matter because the product flopped or I never ended up having to extend the feature beyond the initial implementation.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtlynch.io&#x2F;book-reports&#x2F;start-small-stay-small&#x2F; reply gavinhoward 20 hours agorootparentI didn&#x27;t think of that. That&#x27;s a good idea. reply jwr 19 hours agorootparentprevSolo bootstrapped SaaS founder here. I accrue a lot of tech debt, because (as others have pointed out) I can pay it back whenever I want.That said, I often spend a lot of time and effort building generalized solutions, because these act as leverage down the road. So, while I might cut corners on many things initially, I will often invest a ton of effort into polishing a thing, if that thing can be reused all over the app and make everything work much better.If that&#x27;s unclear, here&#x27;s an example: users need to configure columns in a table in my app. I could provide preferences for configuring that table (quick), or spend a month writing a general-purpose table configuration system that will allow all tables to be configurable. I will choose the latter. reply gavinhoward 19 hours agorootparentThat sounds like a good idea too. reply bko 20 hours agorootparentprevTech is one part and you&#x27;re right that having a manic focus on tech debt will alleviate maintenance. But from my experience the most time consuming stuff is really customer service. Depending on what your product is, it&#x27;ll likely not be 100% self serve. If it&#x27;s expensive and not a lot of customers then they&#x27;ll expect a lot. If it&#x27;s cheap and a lot of customers then there will be a lot of people to service.You can outsource some of this stuff depending on how technical the product is. But realistically your time will be spent talking to customers and coding, about 50&#x2F;50. Even if you get coding down to half it&#x27;s still a lot of work. And managing customers is a lot more mentally draining.That&#x27;s all to say that a 9-5 is not that bad in terms of work life. You can always sign off and kick things up to senior people. You generally do things youre good at, so you won&#x27;t be expected to do customer service, accounting, marketing, sales or a million other things you gotta take on as an independent business reply runako 18 hours agorootparentHaving run a bootstrapped-SaaS, I can say that it&#x27;s 100% correct that customer service is the dominant term, time wise. More importantly, it&#x27;s often the only commitment that has urgency (updating the site or the app can usually wait a day or a week).That said, in my experience customer support was usually tied to new accounts. They need a bunch of support at the beginning. But once they get going, you essentially never get support tickets as long as the app continues to function. We literally had customers go 5+ years without ever filing a support ticket.Once we realized customers do not really want to engage you & would rather self-serve, we invested more in documentation, simplifying UX, etc. Huge benefits to our time commitments for new accounts. I have seen others reduce time investment by having office hours where any customer can join and ask any question. The founder spends an hour or 3 a week and is able to help N customers, and customers are able to help each other as well.Honestly we did not focus too much on tech debt because most of the things we considered tech debt ultimately did not impact the operation of the business. reply gavinhoward 19 hours agorootparentprevYes, you are correct.I have a widely deployed FOSS project that I do \"customer support\" for. It is draining, and it does take a lot of time when I do need to do it. reply giantg2 20 hours agorootparentprev\"The key for me is to reduce tech debt before I release. If I&#x27;m not dealing with tech debt, the actual programming shrinks, and I have time to deal with the other stuff.\"This seems like everyone&#x27;s dream and nobody&#x27;s reality. Good luck. reply gavinhoward 20 hours agorootparentThank you! But I&#x27;ve already done it. I have been constantly refactoring over the three years I&#x27;ve been working on it. My tech debt is minimal at this moment. reply giantg2 19 hours agorootparentYes, but my point is that as you continue to code you are likely to encounter more tech debt, especially as you get more customers and as you need to make dependency version upgrades to address security vulnerabilities. A world without tech debt is a dream. reply gavinhoward 19 hours agorootparentYes, that&#x27;s fair. Sorry for misunderstanding at first. replygjmacd 20 hours agorootparentprevThis is otherwise known as a \"lifestyle business\". It&#x27;s the north star for most people and should be but it&#x27;s not easy.If you build a $500K a year SaaS business and have very little overhead, you can probably take $200K of that revenue as income and have a good work-life balance that&#x27;s very comfortable. I know, I was able to do this without taking VC and bootstrapping 100% on credit cards and my own cash. However, there&#x27;s an inflection point that happens with this sort of business IF you&#x27;re not careful -- or it becomes more successful &#x2F; or becomes a death spiral.If we&#x27;re speaking of a true SaaS model. It can work. But there&#x27;s \"gotchas\".I did well with this and but eventually sold the business for about 3X and went back to work for another company. But for about 7 solid years as we gained customers and got to that $500-700K, it became very hard to keep it a \"balance\" as with every 10 customers we added, the more of my time was spent at work and not as much at home. As we added customers, my \"balance\" was diminished, so I had to hire people, which then cut my income considerably. In the end, I realized it was better to sell the business and take the profit I could to pay off my cards and get something out of it before it killed me. I used to tell people who used to say, \"wow, must be great having a business like that!\" I used to tell them, \"Yes, it&#x27;s amazing 100 hour work week!\".It became more of a \"job\" and less of a \"lifestyle\" as the customer count increased. This could have been anecdotal to my business and product, but I have to believe that it won&#x27;t matter as that size annual revenue demands a bit more of a sophisticated product type. Unless you&#x27;ve hit lightning in a bottle and have a very \"light work\" product that you&#x27;re selling and have cracked the code of hitting $500K and having to do barely anything, more power to you... But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot of those out there and a lot to be created.I just find that with most SaaS businesses I&#x27;ve been involved with and built, the product is solving business problems that aren&#x27;t usually a \"set it and forget it\" kind of product to meet those requirements and just sit back and collect money... I find that most SaaS businesses in that range of revenue are complicated and warrant a higher degree of overhead.The real challenge is, \"little overhead\" to be able to create an income and survive. Support, service and development is expensive and requires more than one person. Good support is important to retain your customers to keep that $500K coming in, and that really is the problem because having just 10-20 customers paying you $500K is far riskier than having 1000 customers paying you $500K.Churn is dangerous in SaaS products that are high cost with smaller customer bases. One or two customers leaving could give you a pretty good dent in your revenue, thus causing you to cut income. So the trick is mitigating churn by having a product that&#x27;s priced at a point that you can gain a larger customer base so that churn isn&#x27;t going to radically impact your revenue.But both strategies are going to require support and service and that costs quite a bit of money and can gravely cut your income that has to be passed to engineers&#x2F;developers who can improve and maintain the product. I had to hire really good support people and some engineers because as we grew that revenue, the product became more complicated and support and service was more demanding (I had about 400 customers). I eventually had to cut my income to pass that to people who could take on more because I couldn&#x27;t do everything.So there is a law of diminishing returns with this sort of business strategy.It can work, but you have to really strategize, have a product strategy that can generate a good sized customer base but requires very little maintenance, development, support and service.But I call this the \"holy grail\" SaaS business -- they simply don&#x27;t exist -- or if they do, they are rare birds.

As a solo founder of a SaaS, I&#x27;d add:* $200K of income from $500K of revenue sounds low. There are places which have SaaS-friendly taxation, I&#x27;m lucky to live in one (EU, Poland) and 75% net margin for the entire business is easy to achieve. An 8.5% tax on revenue is a really good proposition :-)* Support is key. I care a lot about support (I do it myself). It can easily get out of hand and become a chore, but that means something is wrong: if you listen to your customers carefully, you should be changing your SaaS so that less support is needed. I&#x27;m thinking about this a lot.* We&#x27;re talking B2B SaaS here: I also believe it is better to have more customers at lower price points rather than a few big ones. Big ones are difficult to get, and often have bizarre requirements. If you cater to them, you will alienate your other users. But there is a sweet point somewhere: you do not want to go too low, or you&#x27;ll get customers that have very little money. These not only churn more often, they also often cause support issues. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle. reply gjmacd 16 hours agorootparentCouple points to follow up.- US based business, Boston. Taxes are higher, rent is higher (when you needed rent). Salaries are higher (if you want good people). As the founder, I wanted my company to have great benefits and healthcare. That cost (and I&#x27;m not kidding here) reduced our revenue considerably. This is why I&#x27;m a huge fan of a single payer option in the US that takes healthcare off corporations. - B2B business with SMB&#x27;s, average customer ARR was about $3K. E-commerce integration product, so it was a bit of a lift on the technical side with many nuances between integrations. - Support ended up being about 75% of our labor costs. reply gavinhoward 19 hours agorootparentprevI am bookmarking your comment for myself.

I do like the model you have laid out. reply gavinhoward 20 hours agorootparentIt depends on what companies have interest in. Below is a list of the ideas I have.* A build system that is also a package manager like Nix, but usable by mere mortals. Also, it will have an easy way to restrict what builds can do. This one is almost done (well, usable for early adopters, not done); my HN annoucement should be in about three months.* A VCS that, like Fossil, is self-contained with a bug tracker and everything. It will be able to handle binary assets and HUGE files. It will also be easy-to-use. (I&#x27;m going to be testing it on my non-technical wife without telling her how. Once she can use it naturally, I&#x27;ll probably have a good model.) reply jcrites 19 hours agorootparentI’m definitely interested in the build system &#x2F; package manager. I have (idly, in a daydreaming sort of way) considered building something like it myself.I tried to get into Nix recently, but found it difficult to accommodate my workflows within its uncompromising nature. My goal was to set up a reproducible development environment, where anyone at my company could easily get set up to work on our code with a single (or concise set of) action(s). I also tried to use home-manager, which I have heard might have been a mistake.Anyway, Nix is really only designed to manage the entire world. I wasn’t able to use Nix to build a development environment where other developers and I could work inside of it using our existing tools and workflows, including other package managers that want to mutate things — it seemed that Nix was all-or-nothing. This was too disruptive and a large barrier to adoption for me.I would love a tool designed for reproducible builds and development environments that can compromise, and do as much as possible immutably while allowing for local mutation on top. That can be a package manager, but also make it easy to use existing package managers too — with the understanding that these other package managers are typically also able to reliably reproduce a build, within their own mutable state. It’s OK if this potentially needs to mutate “the system” in the process to try to reach a goal state (e.g. installing system-wide package managers, xcode, etc.)Nix really did not seem to be designed to allow me to use other package managers inside it like npm or cargo. It has some support for directly vending packages from those via Nix itself, but that’s not what I want right now; it’s too disruptive to my workflow. We already have all of the build reproduceability that we need via those package managers and via a container based build process. Still, a fair number of development and operational tools are required to develop the software, and I would really have liked a one-click way to set up a development environment that doesn’t require a container (which is not native on Windows or MacOS).(I admit that it is possible that this idea fundamentally could not work for technical reasons, but it seems plausible that it could.)Another challenge that I had was with the complexity of the Nix config and file format. It’s basically a programming language, and there isn’t always one right way to do something. That made it considerably more complicated to solve tasks that would be just a single line command if I was using e.g. Homebrew to solve the same goal (brew install xyz).From a user experience perspective, I would like a tool that provides a simple command line porcelain for mutating the state of the environment, while tracking it immutably under the scenes, so that it’s reproducible. For example, “cmd install foo” should add the “foo” package to my environment (and rebuild it). So at the end I have a declarative description of my environment contents, but I can build that configuration using a sequence of familiar install commands.I admire what Nix is trying to do, and see a lot of merit to the approach for defining an entire machine’s state immutably. For managing and defining the state of servers, it seems like a great idea. However, the cost to adopt it seems high, and the value would probably be marginal in our case, since we don’t need to manage servers to deploy software (instead deploying only containers); and since existing package managers provide a way to build those containers reproducibly. But containers aren&#x27;t ideal for defining the tooling used by an interactive local development environment. reply gavinhoward 18 hours agorootparentBefore your comment, my design could not do that. After your comment, I&#x27;ll make sure it will.As a build system, it can incorporate other build systems and run them natively. It only makes sense that it should do that for package managers as a package manager. So as long as you understand that most other build systems give you opaque binaries, I can make that happen.But on the other hand, I think I can make your mutable environment idea work and cross-platform to. My design will require that the environments all be on the same disk because it will use hard links and a SQLite database, but those work on any platform.But anyway, I also think I could set up mutable environments such that, as long as you only modify it through my tool, it could record those modifications and generate a file to recreate that environment elsewhere. That sounds like Nix, but again, my tool will use other build systems and package managers.Is that what you want? Or did I read it wrong? reply fsflover 17 hours agorootparentprevYou description reminded me of Salt Stack [0] on Qubes OS.

You must grow until you pop. But if you’re some small private org, you can carve out a very comfortable niche. reply brentm 19 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d argue that if you&#x27;re running a internet based company you do need some growth regardless of what you&#x27;ve raised or not raised. Someone is always trying to cut into your business and if you sit back and ignore everything growth related you will eventually be in a worse position.(Besides competition you do also have other things to consider like every year employees need raises, etc).What you really gain by not raising capital is freedom to pursue a less risky operating approach and a lower bar for a positive outcome. reply dokein 20 hours agoparentprevI would add some things to the framing:There&#x27;s two axes. One axis of the matrix is what the founder wants. The other axis is what the business needs.The business needs axis is continuous:- Some businesses obviously don&#x27;t require outside capital (e.g. founder is equipped to get a sellable product built by themselves).- Some businesses require tons of outside capital and cannot be bootstrapped; self-driving cars is an obvious example.- Some are in between; e.g. many b2b products require a baseline level of features &#x2F; complexity with active competitors that&#x27;s hard to achieve by bootstrapping.If a business requires a significant amount of capital AND the maximum outcome is e.g. $500K a year, then it shouldn&#x27;t exist. This is why VCs ask what the market size is.Some founders think raising outside capital is a \"win\". They want that external validation and then convince themselves and&#x2F;or VCs that there&#x27;s a big outcome on the other side (or, in the ZIRP 2021 era, get convinced by VCs). This is a mistake -- the only external validation that matters is market validation.Instead, founders should think of outside capital as a necessary evil, and make a clear-headed decision as to whether the benefits of capital for their businesses is worth the cost (in the form of preference and control -- or at least influence). And it should be worth the cost by some significant margin, because outside capital is often optimizing arithmetic mean outcome whereas the founder is often optimizing something closer to geometric mean outcome. reply edgyquant 20 hours agoparentprevI see this said here all the time, but why are obligated to do so?

You’re forgetting a bunch of things, like what the investment terms might say about it, what your reputation is going to be down the road, all the ways people can apply lots and lots of pressure, how important networking can be, and the fact that in some cases the investor is providing other resources and&#x2F;or might be the gateway to future investment.

Disputes about how exactly to aim that direction happen often. In my own experience, VCs and large investors have this leverage:* Future investment. A major investor pulling back or not participating in the next round usually will result in worse terms, lower valuations or, the round not happening.* Legal issues. Investments come with terms and conditions, and they are rarely, here&#x27;s $5m, do what you want.* Restructuring. From time to time, you need to have investors be on board with restructuring debt or the company. If you are at odds with a major investor, they are a whole lot less likely to be helpful.* \"We&#x27;ll make it hard for you\" Everything from investing in competitors, to introducing key people to job opportunities to guiding customers elsewhere.

Because what if you stop digging just before you strike gold?This is the hardest question of starting a startup (or trying to do anything novel), as far as I can tell, but this was not at all my experience with YC’s advice.The overwhelming feeling is: be humble in the face of reality, try something and try to try it in a way that you can assess whether it’s working — quickly&#x2F;cheaply — then try something new.YC seemed perfectly fine with us either pivoting or staying the course so long as it seemed like we were trying to be intellectually honest with ourselves, and what more could you hope for? It’s not like they have the answer either — nor do they act like it.Edit: Also YC explicitly advises against using VC feedback as signal on your idea. Ideally you’re pivoting well before you run up against “VCs won’t fund my next round,” because clearly things already weren’t working prior to that.

Say you start a restaurant, and after the initial opening craziness, you see that&#x27;s it&#x27;s a sustainable business with lots of loyal customers that like your food. There are people who are going to tell you to open another location, to franchise it out. You&#x27;ll need investors to do that. It may or may not make you more money. You might think your product has the potential to be the next big chain. You also get the choice whether you want to do that or not.If you have a good product that people want to pay for, you more than likely will have the choice to decide whether you want to scale the business up larger. reply lowkey_ 18 hours agoparentprevThis is a good analogy to make, but I&#x27;d add that in this analogy, the majority of land has oil underneath it, and the majority of that oil can be reached without capital for exploration.Fintech, bio, etc. are exceptions, but generally if you have a large TAM, you can still choose to take VC funding or not (you bootstrap at the risk of someone else taking funding to grow more quickly and capture the market). reply underdeserver 13 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t see how this disproves anything.

I&#x27;m not sure if there is a third type, if there is I have not met them.The most successful people I know fell into category two, and all struggled for more than a decade each and had multiple mentors, but ultimately took out loans (from banks, friends, etc) that weren&#x27;t based on owning shares; none relied on VC. None of them are billionaires, but they are solid decimillionaires (if that&#x27;s even a word) whose businesses practically run on autopilot.I think the author makes excellent points that I thought were common sense but I guess they are not, however I don&#x27;t know a lot of techie entrepreneurs anymore, they are all much younger than me (mid-50s).

Group 2 develops fairly portable skills that they can \"sell\" to the market whenever they want to give up on building by themselves.

Maybe the title should be \"You shouldn&#x27;t raise Venture Capital, buy my course instead!\"That being said, the beauty of YC, SAFEs, and seed funding is you don&#x27;t have anyone on your board. You get to decide what you want to build, how you want to build it, etc... The point of joining YC and raising money is because it helps you figure out what to build&#x2F;not to build, and to build faster, and YC is REALLY good at helping you sort that out.There are founders out there who realized they&#x27;ve built a product that doesn&#x27;t have the unicorn potential and pay back their investors.

I would urge any young founders to try to do the same.The reason most successful CEOs are older is due to experience and networks. YC, even if your startup fails, gives you both in spades. It also gives you some financial stability you might not otherwise have to attempt this moonshot. If you don&#x27;t have capital to spend on pay-to-access communities let alone fund a startup then YC makes a good offer.If you manage to fail and pivot multiple times, you&#x27;ve just had a crash course in multiple areas, maybe even multiple industries. If you can&#x27;t get lucky, you can at least get wise.So the \"you\" in this article might actually apply to me. I&#x27;m older, I could self-fund my own work for quite a while, and be happy with a modestly successful business. But the \"you\" in this article is not general.

My PhD taught me so much about how to tackle big ambiguous problems, how to think deeply about things, how to be patient when clarity comes slowly, and how to drag a hard painful project over the finish line. I also made career contacts that were invaluable later.It sounds to me like YC might be worth trying once, especially for a young person, and when you get to the point where you have to pivot, you should take what you&#x27;ve learned and bail.

That dice has a $10M EV. (actually exaggerated high bc you are unlikely to be a sole founder, unlikely to monetize the full $1B of a unicorn yourself, and 1% success rate is for YC cohorts.. which you have an X% chance of getting into to start with!).On the other hand you can focus on T-shaped skills in software engineering & domain expertise, possibly some entrepreneurship.. you course correct that career year to year in a 30 year career, possibly changing jobs every 2&#x2F;3&#x2F;5 years as appropriate. Let&#x27;s exaggerate and say you have a 25% chance of making $500K. That dice has an EV of $125K.. peanuts!The $10M EV dice you get maybe 2-3 rolls in a lifetime versus ~40 rolls annually at the $125K EV dice option. This still sounds like the first EV is better - $25M vs $5M!However 97% of EV=$10M dice rollers get $0 over there entire life. Hypothetically every EV=$125K dice roller will win 7.5 times in their life because they get so many rolls.It seems to me the fetishizing of youth and 20 something founders whereas the optimal path for an INDIVIDUAL might be to roll the boring $125k dice for a while, building up savings and experience.. and then try a few rolls of the $10M dice later in life when you may actually have realer ideas, a professional network, etc. reply renegade-otter 20 hours agoparentprevThis is how bootstrappers market stuff.

I get it, you have a bootstrapping course.Anyway, to the YC point about pivoting and digging a hole: Daniel has 0 experience with YC and this is absolutely not what YC encourages. YC is more than happy to see you pivot. You have the driver seat and you know best.Do I agree you shouldn’t take VC money so easily? Yes. Do I agree everything applies to YC? Definitely not. Hell, pick your VCs well and you won’t face any of those problems. reply AlchemistCamp 20 hours agoprev> ” I can&#x27;t afford to rely on 26 lifetimes. But maybe you think you’re special. You’re not like those 3,950 dummies who failed. Maybe you are in fact special, but I wouldn’t rely too much on that. Business is much more random than it seems. If business was predictable, YC wouldn&#x27;t have a measly 1.25% success rate, or thereabouts.”This argument is very disappointing and dishonest. The piece repeatedly implies and assumes that every YC-funded company that isn’t currently valued at over a billion dollars is a failure for the founder.This ignores the fact that many companies are still growing and will cross that threshold in a few years. It’s also not an honest representation of all the smaller acquisitions to call them “failures”.Twitch’s acquisition wasn’t quite for a billion, but it was a massive success for its founders. There are many other companies that exited in the 9-figure range, for which this is true. Plenty of others excited in the 8 figure range and were still better outcomes than if the founders had just remained employees. Even those whose startups went to zero usually end up fine in terms of career.What percentage of Daniel’s students have built unicorns? Have any or are they all, by his own metric, “failures”? reply esafak 15 hours agoparentAt those success rates, he&#x27;s going to need a lot of students working for long enough to exit to yield statistically significant results. How long has his program been open? reply AlchemistCamp 13 hours agorootparentI bought it two years ago, and according to Gumroad, the version I bought has made 3,499 sales. It might be more due to different versions of his course, and it&#x27;s certainly not much fewer than the pool of 4,000 he&#x27;s using to calculate the failure rate for YC founders. reply aussiegreenie 12 hours agoprevI work with University spin-outs mainly in Life Sciences. They take years and cost millions of dollars betfore they can start generating revenue.I also own a metal recycling business. It is on track for USD 10 million revenue with about $1 million EBIT. This business has a low risk, it is cash-based and generates cash every month.Basically, working with the startup are almost a charity. Yes, I like going to various universities, yes, I dicussing Deep Technology but my main source of incone and wealth comes from used beer cans.Why do I need more that $500K pa? I will be dead soon enough. reply portman 20 hours agoprevI believe the author made a simple math error.Economic returns of VC-backed companies follow a power law distribution. This means that the vast majority of the returns for the VC are at the \"fat head\" of the distribution. The \"long tail\" does not impact returns, for the VC.However, for the founder, those returns in the tail can be life-changing. It takes a $5B exit for YC to care. But a $5M exit can be real money for the founder.So the correct math, from the perspective of the founder, is not \"what % are unicorns\" but rather \"what % sell for more than capital invested\" and that number is likely to be closer to 50% than 1%. reply DVassallo 19 hours agoparentI’ve been on the acquirer side of $50M exits and from what I’ve seen almost no one makes any money in those situations. It is usually a deal done in desperation and everyone is diluted to the brim. reply portman 15 hours agorootparentI mean, N=3, but I&#x27;ve made decent money on smaller exits.The relevant metric is not exit price, it&#x27;s ratio of exit price to pref stack; i.e. raise $40M and sell for $50M, founder is worse than if they raised $2M and sold for $10M. reply anonu 20 hours agoprevThis is sort of a gibberish article. It has nothing to do with YC really. The story being told is that of any venture backed startup. The investors take the risk but if you build a business they may do better than you financially. Money generates money.Another point they make is what I call \"shots on goal\". Investors will have tons of shots. That&#x27;s the nature of investors. If your a startup founder it&#x27;s tempting to think you have \"one shot\" but that&#x27;s nonsense. Every day you have shots, every client call is a shot, every product decision is a shot. reply jefftk 19 hours agoprev> only about 50 companies met that expectation out of the 4,000 or so that went through their program. That’s 1.25% ... All those 4,000 kids who went into YC also thought they were visionaries, and where are they now? They’re all in the startup cemetery, except for a dozen or so who despite the low odds managed to flip 10 heads in a row.This is a bit nitpicky, but:* Some of those 4,000 may end up super successful but haven&#x27;t yet; this isn&#x27;t considering lag.* Ten heads in a row is 0.1%; this is closest to six heads in a row.I agree that your odds are low, and you should consider how much you care about a small chance of a massive success. But the odds do matter! reply steveBK123 16 hours agoprevI think people also way overestimate the founder takes from even successful exits.One of my classmates was a co-founder of a company that had a near-$100M exit (acquired) ~10 years ago (back when that was real money). That sounds like a lot, right?By the time the VCs took their cut, the equity grants were deducted, and the founders split the proceeds.. it wasn&#x27;t life changing money.The money wasn&#x27;t much different than a typical equity grant at a FAANG for a 30-something dev. Especially after 5-10 years of effort. And then you might be stuck working for the acquirer for some contractual period before you can exit.It was also one of the many ZIRP businesses that would never be bootstrapped. That is - gain a bunch of customers by giving away services for free in hope that you somehow get so many that you can ... do something, later. reply karl11 20 hours agoprevFrom the outside looking in, it seems to me that the biggest benefit of YC is the people you get to meet and build relationships with along w&#x2F; the advice and feedback and accountability to focus on the things that actually matter to growing a business. These are lessons and relationships that will carry through even if you decide that VC-backed hypergrowth isn&#x27;t for you and you want a small lifestyle business. Joining YC does not preclude you from doing things differently, but it does provide access to some amazingly smart and capable people that would be hard, if not impossible, to replicate somewhere else. reply KaoruAoiShiho 20 hours agoprevDon&#x27;t really get it, there is no should or shouldn&#x27;t. If you think your idea has multi billion dollar market then go for it, if it doesn&#x27;t then YC probably don&#x27;t want you anyway, there is no conflict. reply cubes 19 hours agoprevThis article would be more accurately titled, \"Why you shouldn&#x27;t try to build a venture capital funded business.\" Of course, my suggested title is not nearly as compelling and edgy as the actual title, and would be less likely to make it to the front page of Hacker News.The content in the article isn&#x27;t inaccurate or misleading per se, but it&#x27;s also basically repackaging well understood information about the economics of startups and venture backed businesses.Further, the author asserts that, if you&#x27;re trying to optimize your personal economic outcomes, you should not pursue venture funding. But this wrongly assumes that money is the sole motivator people have for starting a business. Further, it ignores the massive economic value that the venture ecosystem has created.Some people want to retire early. Some people have bigger ambitions. Neither group is right or wrong, but, if you&#x27;re starting the business, you should know which group you&#x27;re part of. reply DVassallo 16 hours agoparent> \"Further, it ignores the massive economic value that the venture ecosystem has created.\"The subtitle of the post is: \"Or why YC is good for the economy but bad for your economy.\" reply cracrecry 18 hours agoprevThis man is calling anyone that does not become a billionaire a failure and those that get it a \"success\".This binary thinking is beyond stupid. It is a reasonable thing with hard work to become millionaire and to earn more money than what you need. It is a reasonable thing to work on interesting problems with interesting people.Once you have enough money your are not going to get happier with more money. On the contrary, with billions in the bank you can not do normal things because people could want to kidnap your family, and people around you are faking all the time their true intentions. You are being asked for money all the time and so on. You can trust nobody.Most people that get into YC are going to get enough of those good things, but not too much, and this is going to make them to be in the top 5% in the world in satisfaction. reply raincole 17 hours agoparentHe even has a \"Unlearning is hard\" section in his article.Maybe he needs to unlearn the idea that you need to go big or go die. reply shtopointo 18 hours agoprevI like David&#x27;s posts on Twitter generally, but this piece is poorly written.Big opener, controversial take, put a thing down, just to build your own product up by comparison, lack of nuance... from the get-go you can tell it&#x27;s a marketing piece.The premise imo is wrong.> Silicon Valley is a non-ergodic industryHow do you define this? Obviously Daniel&#x27;s take is on the founders that failed, that were stressed out by investors etc. but he doesn&#x27;t talk about the thousands of people with the highest paying, most comfortable job they&#x27;ve ever had. People that switched from manual labor to customer support or programming. Or the thousands of minted (multi-)millionaires that got there by just working a comfortable 9-5 for 5-10 years? (in fact, he may be one of the beneficiaries of a SV style system, through his AWS career that sounded like it landed him enough money to start on his entrepreneurial journey – not so non-ergodic now...)And of course, he loses credibility because he is selling his course. The whole point of the blog post is to sour YC and siphon off a few readers to his course. Kudos to him too, I mean, that&#x27;s marketing, and it seems like that course is great too! But, imo, he is not taking the high road here.YC has a great track record at helping people succeed. And if they didn&#x27;t succeed, it opened doors. YC foots the bill for you to explore an idea. Sure, you can be smart enough to get into YC, but still naive enough to believe a religion-version of YC, about changing the world and something-something vision; then again, maybe you are smart enough to know what you&#x27;re getting yourself into. Or you should.Because on the other hand, there are plenty of people peddling get-rich-quick schemes out there, and how you can make it on your own, \"just do this thing\". Life&#x27;s tough out there, and going solo is a difficult journey (something not mentioned often). You work for a company, or you work with investors, you are protected &#x2F; sheltered. Choose your own path, for sure, but also recognize the pros and cons and how nuanced this situation is. reply nkotov 19 hours agoprevHaving been on both sides of this, ran a YC startup and now running a \"lifestyle\" SaaS business, the honest reality is that both have their risks&#x2F;rewards. I wouldn&#x27;t trade anything for the experience + network I received from being a part of a YC batch. But bootstrapping a business and going from $0 to $1 is also just as exciting for me as well right now. Most likely for my next business, I will be re-applying for YC again.The best note that I saved that someone else wrote: Know What You Want. Do you want to build a lifestyle business? Do you want to grow into a company with employees? Do you want funding? An exit? You should figure these things out. Decide your own goals, don’t let someone decide it for you. reply krosaen 20 hours agoprevI bet the distribution of outcomes among all YC participants tells a different story - not all or nothing. Getting acquired or acqui-hired, while not as prestigious, often nets the founders as much or more than the opportunity cost of not taking lucrative tech jobs. And surely there are plenty that need to close up shop without any financial outcome at all as well, but again, would love to see the distribution.Also, even those who do not net any financial outcome, how many of those founders would say they regret going through YC? Guessing they have built a great network, learned a ton more than they would have as an IC at a big company, and are well positioned to do whatever they want to next, even joining a big company after all. reply BiteCode_dev 20 hours agoprevSeems like it&#x27;s just a matter of the stats you want, goals you have and compromise you are willing to make, as usual.Per the article itself, Y combinators is actually a good deal if your objectives and theirs align.If they don&#x27;t, don&#x27;s sign up.Also the sky is blue. reply Mimmy 17 hours agoprevThis is a really bad article. There is a nugget of truth, but it&#x27;s never properly articulated because the author himself doesn&#x27;t actually understand the distinction.If you&#x27;ve already decided you want to build a unicorn and are willing to make take thatIf you reach the magma layer and you still have nothing, then you’d be encouraged to pivot. But that’s not how you find business opportunities in the real world.I think he is treating pivoting as if it&#x27;s some totally random exercise. Surely a pivot is when you see something within your existing activity that may be a better avenue to pursue? Or am I misunderstanding that? reply langsoul-com 20 hours agoprevI think this article is more directed towards all Venture Capital funding rather than just Y Comb. Mostly the type that demands an absolutely insane amount of return.Actually more like why you shouldn&#x27;t make a startup and instead live a bit longer. Then, if an idea comes to you, it&#x27;d be vetted through more experience and time.And if you still want VC funding, just remember the house is setup to always win. reply sobellian 19 hours agoprev> One of the bad learnings you get from YC is that there’s a formula for success, and it looks like this: First you do some brainstorming. Then you come up with a good idea that can scale to a billion dollars (otherwise what’s the point of getting out of bed in the morning?) Then you work hard until you find “product-market",

The Best. This season is devoted to exploring themes of competition, etc. One such facet is how tech companies compete to all release AI-bullshit features that blow butt. If you’d like to read the first piece of Season One, check it out here: I got a perfect score on my SAT and all I got was this lousy feeling of never being enough. First, there’ll be a nice big splash page like this: Omg yes I want all these things! How could you not click?? You’re human. So you click to ‘get started’ and are taken to this: Ok wow this is so cool! Look there’s even a photo of the whole planet lit up by the ‘aha’ moments of everyone using AI!! Can’t fuckin’ wait to change everything. The app then asks me to describe my task? I mean…idk. What am I supposed to say here? The app doesn’t really give me much detail…duh! That’s because the AI is super smart and I can tell it to do anything. Silly dumb me being an idiot of the Old Way of Doing Things. I can just let it rip! How about… “Create a marketing campaign to get people excited about a new internet where things are easy. Include a mascot and a catch phrase.” I hit enter and…. How we got here It’s a race to the bottom. Companies see their idiot friends creating AI and they want a piece of that hype hype yum yum so they do it too. For example: Don’t bother with that pathetic, 10-minute a day meditation bullshit on Calm.com Try Headspace AI. where one of our robots will meditate FOR YOU and then tell you all the lessons it learned.” Saving you time for what really matters. Here’s some article about it: Jason Corsello, CEO and general partner of Acadian Ventures, a venture firm focused on the future of work startups, explained that A.I. remains tantalizing for investors, even amid the historic downturn. That may not be a good thing for startups, he cautions. \"This area of A.I. is somewhat overhyped. It's over-invested, it's overvalued. When you're seeing seed-stage companies raise between $100 million and $150 million with nothing more than a pitch deck, that's a bit concerning.\" But the froth isn't unfamiliar. The A.I. boom, and the crush of startups now competing for success, could be a product of copycat logic. As money is pumped into new firms, nobody wants to be left out, Oded Shenkar, a professor of management and human resources at Ohio State University, explains. \"It's a common error to think of startups always as innovators,\" he says, \"when you have a gold rush, of course, you're going to have more imitation.\" Ah ok great so basically all the companies are playing copycat with Daddy Andreesen's Money Slush until something dumb happens and one of them gets super rich? Cool. Meanwhile, the people must endure this: Wow look at that really cool image of a fairy cat. Um no that looks like it was made by a wood nymph on a godsized dose of LSD+speed who decided to ‘go for it’ and draw like a computer. There are apps who use AI well They don’t call it AI because they are not children. All of Google is AI. But you don’t see them bandying it around like a kid with new light up shoes. On the other hand, you’ve got Canva promoting their new “Magic Design (TM”) which they have to make sure you understand is in Beta which is tech-speak for ‘it blows butt.’ Ok cool let’s give it a whirl: Like come on this is dog shit and I mean an old dog who has trouble shitting: I am asking Stop it. Stop trying to market garbage as “magic.” AI is not magic. This is magic: Look at how freaked out the dude leaning over is. His child has never seen him that way before. This dude is looking up like ‘no way he did that without god's help’ If I see “now with AI-enabled assistant” anywhere on a website, I run away but first I throw the entire computer out the window (after making sure no one is under it). The entire system has been tainted by the AI-disease and now it will never be okay to use again. I will pay money for you to not use the word AI anywhere on your app. Make that the premium tier and I will buy it this is hell why are you doing this to us. And yes, as a person named Alex who is often called Al by friends, I have a personal stake in this. When I see “AI Magic” I think it’s saying I am magic or it is using my magic for its app and that’s illegal. More of my hot takes on AI and tech: can everyone kindly shut the fuck up about AI i refuse to talk to you with those stupid ass goggles on your face Comments Am I crazy about all this AI stuff or does it really suck? Are you also someone who keeps getting tricked into thinking some AI-feature will be cool only to have your heart broken again and again? Are there any good uses of AI I’m just not realizing (that market themselves as AI??) What’s a non-AI non-tech good thing in your life? Is this whole piece a big hipster-draped ‘the new tech is bad’ screed from a guy who is, according to several doctors, getting older? I’m teaching a workshop soon! An Invitation The good people at the writing collective Foster have asked me and Lyle McKeany to come back and teach a workshop on how to write funny and vulnerably as part of their 4-week writing intensive called Season 4: A More Beautiful Question. Here’s a quick description of the season. Check it out and lemme know if you have questions! “Seasons” are month-long initiations into the magic of writing and storytelling. Together, we’ll approach our writing not as a means of providing Answers, but as a way of inhabiting the Questions that matter to us, as I hope I exhibited in this essay. We’ll seek to dance with uncertainty instead of treating it as a problem to be solved. We’ll explore, play, and be in conversation with something larger than ourselves. And when it’s all said and done, we’ll each hit publish on a piece of writing that’s crackling with our energy and humanity. Care to join us?

It was even beginning to believe things they&#x27;d have difficulty believing in Salt Lake City. It had never heard of Salt Lake City, of course.

All that matters is that the hype train passes enough people that you can cash out your \"investment\".Each investment round is the cash out for previous ones, and the last round is the IPO, where ignorant (no negative connotation, just unknowing) public is left holding the bag of air.And like the MLM pyramid schemes, sometimes the product or service does have some value to some people. But it gets sold to anyone and everyone, most of whom have no use for it.Most products or services don&#x27;t need AI.

A lot of everyday consumers benefit from being constantly reminded that this is how things work, because humans are very susceptible to some bad heuristics. A very, very common line of reasoning that one sees in discussions about tech, even on HN, is effectively, \"A is a piece of garbage that someone threw at the wall, and it stuck.

After that point businesses and individuals have the right to waste money on whatever they like.Note, this is why it&#x27;s also important to have government funded research on things that may not be profitable.

While she was in the guard, she deployed with a civil affairs unit to Djibouti, which we have always maintained a permanent presence in to secure shipping lanes for oil. She was their supply sergeant and she identified a problem with the local water supply and got them all the equipment they needed to fix it, and in the process probably legitimately saved at least thousands of lives.

But you&#x27;ll never see her in a history book or read about her on Wikipedia because it was still illegal at the time for women to serve in combat units at all, and officially she was on the books as part of the brigade headquarters company, only filling in because they were severely understaffed.I try to keep her in mind when I feel like I&#x27;m being slighted at work and not getting sufficient recognition for accomplishments as I earn a salary triple what she gets as a Lieutenant Colonel now. reply sanderjd 19 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;m sure this would out your company, but if you can say, I&#x27;m curious what the blurb said about why they were included in the list.

If you want 95% accuracy, it takes some tuning work. If you also want to avoid 1% total batshit nonsense (repeat \"chicken\" 50 times), then you have to check for that. Earlier models were sometimes wrong, but they were not quite so aggressively wrong as the 1% case of LLMs.That&#x27;s just my anecdotal experience, but it leaves me both optimistic about applications in the right spaces and worried that people are just shipping something that&#x27;s OK 75% of the time and calling it a product. reply butlike 19 hours agoparentprevTo your last point, LLMs can translate your writing into different styles.

We have known that there was novel behavior happening as early as GPT-2.GPT-3 represented a clearly novel transformative technology. But we still didn’t know what to do with it.The reason for this is that the people who come up with products are generally a different set of people from those who innovate novel ML models.The latter tend to be PhDs or the extremely mathematically talented.The former tend to be a mix of product-y software engineers & engineer-y product & strategy people.There were some products, GitHub Copilot being the breakaway. Knowledge needs time to diffuse, and a market demand is necessary to catalyze that quickly.Out of exasperation, OpenAI decided to take one of the most common prompting use cases on the GPT-3 beta playground, Q&A, and make a chat product, almost as a technology demonstrator.Then ChatGPT exploded to hundreds of millions of users.All hell broke loose. Every Fortune 500 promised a “generative AI” rollout. And of course, like feverish corporate-branded “metaverse” stuff it all sucks.You can’t “corporate partnership” and “internally accelerate” a technological shift of this magnitude. You can’t hire BCG to do it for you. And you can’t tack a model onto your existing product and call it done.LLMs and other new foundation models require fundamentally new products. They require new middleware to be deployed like vector databases, RAG frameworks, and agentic systems.Start ups are starting to crack these problems.But my fear is that when the bottom drops out of the corporate efforts, the investment attitudes will shift just as there’s the most work to be done. reply janalsncm 15 hours agoparentLLMs have been more useful on the encoder side than the decoder side in my experience. Creating embeddings is useful in all sorts of ways. Specifically, if your business involves any sort of recommendation system, embeddings are useful.On the decoder side, the use cases are more subtle. Rarely do you want your product to be the raw output of a statistical language model. More often the output is an enabler of other things your business is doing. For example, you can use it to develop “doc queries”, which are queries that a doc might be surfaced under. This can help with cold start issues by supplementing existing doc info. reply dboreham 16 hours agoparentprev> We still don’t know what LLMs are forI have found the LLM concept to be tremendously valuable in illuminating my understanding of the operation of human brains (both mine and others).

If they had found it to be useful for reliably solving one or more real, clearly-identified problems, they would start by talking about that, because that sends a stronger signal to a higher-quality pool of potential customers.The thing is, companies who have that kind of product are relatively rare, because getting to that point takes work.

Maybe it&#x27;ll work out (networking, internet, cloud) or it&#x27;ll go bust (push, blockchain, etc).If it works out, the company gets to ride a new tech wave while avoiding obsolescence (see Yahoo, DEC, Sun, etc). If it doesn&#x27;t pan out, the company writes off the investment and moves on to the next shiny thing.From the leadership perspective, it actually makes sense to jump on the latest shiny thing. From the mid-level manager&#x27;s perspective, it sucks to be the one who has to go make sense of it. reply potatolicious 18 hours agorootparentprevI spent time at Google and found this to be the case as well. I think the only \"cure\" for this is good upper management that is isn&#x27;t swayed by the flavor of the moment hype, and also a culture of being monomaniacally product-focused.Places that are intensely product-focused aren&#x27;t immune from frothy hype, but at least it&#x27;s forced through the critical filter of \"ok but what does this do for our product really\", which is a vital part of separating the wheat from the chaff when it comes to new ideas.My main beef with Google is that the company&#x27;s culture is intensely not product-focused. The company&#x27;s defined by its origin story of a groundbreaking technology that happened upon product-market fit, and it&#x27;s pathologically unable to do the opposite: start with a clear-eyed product vision and working backwards to the constituent technologies. reply tomrod 18 hours agorootparentprevMaybe a minor tangent, but I really enjoyed playing with Google Assistant when it first came out.

Remember when every product had to be made out of Blockchain, and startups lead their marketing copy with \"Blockchain-powered\"?

Screwing around with prompts can get you closer to the high end of that range, but if you want to do better than that you&#x27;ve got to define your problem well and go through a lot of the grindy work that you had to do with symbolic A.I. and have always had to do with machine learning. (You&#x27;re going to need a large evaluation set to know how well your prompt-based solution works, and know that it didn&#x27;t get broken by a software update, at the very least.)The image that comes to my mind, almost intrusively, is Mickey Mouse from the movie Fantasia where he shows various sins, laziness most of allhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VErKCq1IGIUSo many of these efforts show off terrible quality control. There is a site that has posted about 250 galleries (at a rate of 2 day) of about 70 pornographic images a piece generated by A.I. At best the model generates highly detailed images including the stitching on the seams of clothes, clothing with floral prints matching cherry blossom trees in the background and sometimes crowds of people that really click thematically. Then you notice the girls with two belly buttons and if you look enough you&#x27;ll see some with 7 belly buttons and realize the model doesn&#x27;t really understand the difference between body parts and skin so there is a nipple that looks like part of the bra rather than showing through the bra, etc.Then there are the hideously distorted penises that are too long, too short, disembodied, duplicated, bifurcated, pointing in the wrong direction and would otherwise be nightmare fuel for anyone with castration anxiety.If the wizard was in charge he&#x27;d be cleaning these up, I mean looking at 150 images a day and culling the worst is less than an hour of work. But no, Mickey Mouse is in charge.\"Chat\" in \"ChatGPT\" is a good indication of what is going on because it is brilliant at chat where it can lean on a conversation partner to provide meaning and guidance and where the ability to apologize for mistakes really seduces people, even if it doesn&#x27;t change its wrong behavior. The trouble is trying to get it to perform \"off the leash\" at a task that matters is a matter of pushing a bubble around under a rug, that \"chasing an asymptote\" situation is itself seductive and one of the worst problems in technology development that entraps the most sophisticated teams, but put it together with unsophisticated people who don&#x27;t think systematically and a system which already has superhuman powers of seduction (e.g. \"chat\" as opposed to problem solving) and you are cruising for a bruising. reply geysersam 18 hours agorootparentprev*linear logistic regressionI mean, a typical LLM is also logistic regression, but it&#x27;s not linear. reply flashgordon 19 hours agoparentprevDouble sigh.

And people on the sidelines who predicted that we would all shop online are IMO only correct in the most meaningless and facile sense, because they had no specific predictions of what would work and what wouldn&#x27;t, just a vague gesture at a futuristic buzzword.It&#x27;s easy to wave generally in the direction of an abstract concept and say \"that&#x27;s a big deal\", literally anyone can do it (and did! with crypto!), but it&#x27;s specific predictions and hypotheses that separate those who know WTF they&#x27;re talking about from LinkedIn thought-leadership pablum.Likewise \"AI is a big deal\" in and of itself is not an astute statement or meaningful prediction.

We evaluate our pre-trained model against established statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods, demonstrating that TimeGPT zero-shot inference excels in performance, efficiency, and simplicity. Our study provides compelling evidence that insights from other domains of artificial intelligence can be effectively applied to time series analysis. We conclude that large-scale time series models offer an exciting opportunity to democratize access to precise predictions and reduce uncertainty by leveraging the capabilities of contemporary advancements in deep learning.

We&#x27;ve tried most time series deep learning models that claim to be SoTA - N-BEATS, N-HiTS, every RNN variant that was popular pre-transformers, and they don&#x27;t beat an MLP that just uses lagged values as features. I&#x27;ve talked to several others in the forecasting space and they&#x27;ve found the same result.On mid-dimensional data, LightGBM&#x2F;Xgboost is by far the best and generally performs at or better than any deep learning model, while requiring much less finetuning and a tiny fraction of the computation time.And on low-dimensional data, (V)ARIMA&#x2F;ETS&#x2F;Factor models are still king, since without adequate data, the model needs to be structured with human intuition.As a result I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of any of these claims about a generally high performing \"time series\" model. Training on time series gives a model very limited understanding of the fundamental structure of how the world works, unlike a language model, so the amount of generalization ability a model will gain is very limited. reply waltherg 3 hours agoparentGreat write-up, thank you. Do you have rough measures for what constitutes high&#x2F;mid&#x2F;low- dimensional data? And how do you use XGBoost et al for multi-step forecasting, I.e. in scenarios where you want to predict multiple time steps in the future? reply isoprophlex 2 hours agorootparentBecause they&#x27;re so cheap to train, you can just use n models if you want to predict n steps ahead.In sklearn, if you have a single-output regressor, use this for ergonomics: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scikit-learn.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;modules&#x2F;generated&#x2F;sklearn.mu...The added benefit is that you optimize each regressor towards its own target timestep t+1 ... t+n. A single loss on the aggregate of all timesteps is often problematic reply pfalke 1 hour agoparentprevFoundational models can work where so far „needs human intuition“ was the state of things. I can picture a time series model with large enough Training corpus being able to deal quite well with typical quirks of seasonalities, shocks, outliers, etc.I fully agree regarding how things have been so far, but I’m excited to see practitioners try out models such as the one presented here — it might just work. reply yeahwhatever10 7 hours agoparentprevThanks for this write up.

And then simpler algorithms are able to highlight deviations from the norm? reply screye 10 hours agoprevNo, Transformers are not a silver bullet.As much as Transformers feel like the state of the art universal function approximators, people need to realize why they work so well for language and vision.Transformers parallelize incredibly well, and they learn sophisticated intermediate representations. We start seeing neat separation of different semantic concepts in space. We start seeing models do delimiter detection naturally. We start seeing models reason about lines, curves, colors, dog ears etc. The final layers of a Transformer are then putting these sophisticated concepts together to learn high level concepts like dog&#x2F;cat&#x2F;blog etc.Transformers (and deep learning methods in general) do not work for time series data because they have yet to extract any novel intermediate representations from said data.At face value, how do you even work with a &#x27;token window&#x27; ? At the simplest level, time series modelling is about identifying repeating patterns over very different lifecycles conditioned on certain observations about the world. You need a model to natively be able to reason over years, days and seconds all at the same time to even be able to reason about the problem in the first place. Hilariously, last week&#x27;s streaming LLM paper from MIT might actually help here.Secondly, the improvements appear marginal at best. If you&#x27;re proposing a massive architecture change, removing observability & and explainability .........then you better have some incredible results.Truth is, if someone identifies a groundbreaking technique for timeseries forecasting, then they&#x27;d be an idiot to tell anyone about it before making their first $Billion$ on the market. Hell, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;d be an idiot for stopping at a billion. Time series forecasting is the most monetarily rewarding problem you could solve. If you publish a paper, then by implication, I expect it to be disappointing. reply Xcelerate 10 hours agoparent> Truth is, if someone identifies a groundbreaking technique for timeseries forecastingIt’s really quite simple. Just iterate through all possible monotone universal Turing machines where the input tape consists of all data we can possibly collect concatenated with the time series of interest.

In standard time series prediction the features of the distribution are mostly things like \"periodic patterns are continued\" or \"growth patterns are continued\". A transformer that is trained on language data essentially learns time series prediction where a large variety of complex feature appear that influence the continuation. Language data is so complex and diverse that continuing a text necessitates in-context learning: Being able to find some common features in any kind of string of symbols, and using those to continue the text. Just think that language data could contain huge excel tables of various data, like stock market prices, or weather recordings. It is therefore plausible that in-context learning can be very powerful, enough to perform zero-shot time series continuation. Moreover, I believe that due to in-context learning language data + transformer architecture has the potential to really obtain general intelligence like behaviour. General pattern recognition. Language data is complex enough that SGD must lead to general pattern recognition and continuation. We are only at the beginning, and right now we are focused on finetuning which destroys in-context learning. But we will soon train giant transformers on every modality, every string of symboly we can find. reply tsumnia 6 hours agoparentprev> people need to realize why they work so well for language and vision.I agree with your entire post, however this sentence made me think, well video is just layered vision. Why couldn&#x27;t frames of vision work similar to vision?

I thought it did? reply pizza 12 minutes agorootparentedit: I&#x27;m not sure what jdkwkbdbs means (dead-banned) by \"LLMs don&#x27;t. ML works pretty well.\" (well, I do); LLMs solve certain tasks -- and really interesting ones, at that, too -- at certain average cross-entropy loss levels, and typically form the Pareto front of the models of all sizes in terms of parameter count, at least once you start looking at the biggest that we have, e.g. start above a certain parameter count; and they typically increase in accuracy with respect to parameter count in a statistically significant fashion.In essence, they represent the state of the art with respect to those specific tasks, as measured at the current time. Though you may desire for there to be a better (cross entropy loss, accuracy percentage so 100% acc) tuple at any given instant (e.g. (optimal expected ce-loss, an actual proof of correctness)), for the current time, it seems like not only do they do the best as a class of models for these sets of tasks, but also improve the fastest in terms of accuracy as a class of models as of late. They&#x27;re quite noteworthy in that regard, fundamentally, imo.

Not sure why this would be more expensive to train and run than a Transformer model, and even if true, ARIMA is so ubiquitous that comparing resources & time would be enlightening.

That is why we put so much effort into creating fast and scalable Arimas and AutoArima in Python [1].Regarding your valid concern. There are several reasons for the high computational costs. First, ARIMA and other \"statistical\" methods are local, so they must train one different model for each time series. (ML and DL models are global, so you have &#x27;one&#x27; model for all the series.) Second, the ARIMA model usually performs poorly for a diverse set of time series, like the one considered in our experiments. The AutoARIMA is a better option, but its training time is considerably longer, given the number and length of the series. Also, AutoARIMA tends to be very slow for long series. In short: for the 500k series we used for benchmarcking, ARIMA would have taken literally weeks and would have been very expensive. That is why we included many well-performing local \"statistical\" models, such as the Theta and CES. We used the implementations on our open-source ecosystem for all the baselines, including StatsForecast, MLForecast, and Neuralforecast. We will release a reproducible set of experiments on smaller subsets soon![1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nixtla.github.io&#x2F;statsforecast&#x2F;docs&#x2F;models&#x2F;arima.htm... reply m3at 12 hours agoparentprevI was surprised too!While I could find some excuses to exclude ARIMA, notably that in practice you need to input some important priors about your time series (periodicity, refinements for turning points, etc) for it to work decently, \"prohibitive compute and extensive training time\" are just not applicable.That part is a bit wanky, but the rest of the paper, notably the zero shot capability, is very interesting if confirmed.

We are surprised that this has gained so much attention and are excited about both the positive and critical responses. Some important clarifications:The primary goal of this first version of the paper is to present TimeGPT-1 and showcase our preliminary findings from a large-scale experiment, demonstrating that transfer learning at this scale is indeed possible in time series. As mentioned in the paper, we deeply believe that pre-trained models can represent a very cost-effective solution (in terms of computational resources) for many applications. Please also consider that this is a pre-print version. We are working on releasing a reproducible set of experiments on a subset of the data, so stay tuned!All previous work of Nixtla has been open source and we believe TimeGPT could be a viable commercial product, offering forecasting and anomaly detection out of the box for practitioners. Some interesting details were omitted because they represent a competitive advantage that we hope to leverage in order to grow the company and keep providing better solutions and continuing to build our ecosystem.As some others have mentioned in the thread, we are working to onboard as many people as possible into a free trial so that more independent practitioners can validate the accuracy for their particular use cases. You can read some initial impressions of the creators Prophet [1] and GluonTS [2] or listen to an early test by the people from H20 [3]. We hope to see some more independent benchmarcks soon.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;seanjtaylor&#x2F;status&#x2F;1694745912776749296?s=20 [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;tim-januschowski_foundational...

You can’t get perfection from modelling a complex system with the (relatively) few variables that you can actually measure. Assumptions are always evolving, and are always going to be broken at some point or another.That’s the opening line, right? Uncertainty is a fact of life. With time series forecasts, the best you can ever hope to do is give probability bounds, and even then you can only really do so by either:- limiting by the rules of the game (e.g. the laws of physics, or the rules of a stock exchange)- using past dataThe former is only useful if you’re the most risk averse person on the planet, and the latter is only useful if you are willing to assume the past is relevant. reply AndrewKemendo 11 hours agorootparentGood response.

Tokens over \"time\" where time just happens to be represented by discrete, sequential memory.Each token could encode a specific amplitude for the signal. You could literally just have tokens [0,1,...,MAX_AMPLITUDE] and map your input signal to this range.In the most extreme case, you could have 2 tokens - zero and one. This is the scheme used in DSD audio. The only tradeoff is that you need way more samples per unit time to represent the same amount of information, but there are probably some elegant perf hacks for having only 2 states to represent per sample.There are probably a lot of variations on the theme where you can \"resample\" the input sequences to different token rate vs bits per token arrangements. reply beernet 10 hours agoparentprevThat is technically true, however, they are two very different problems from a domain&#x2F;business perspective reply braza 13 hours agoprevHuge props for the Nixtla team for the tool.A personal note here is that they could done a better job on the tokens because the announcement was so grandiose and maybe they underestimated people with legit interest.I’m using all libs from Nixtla with active advocation and I did not have a token; meanwhile lots of guys posting their usages on Twitter. reply dopidopHN 13 hours agoprevSorry I’m not in that field.

He didn&#x27;t want to shell out for a real quant; he asked my prof it he knew anyone and I decided I could use the extra money. I came up with some techniques that appeared to produce a small profit, unfortunately it was a hair less than what he&#x27;d have to pay on commissions. He wanted to keep pushing but I decided to hang it up. I&#x27;m sure that there are people here who know far more about this than my decades-old experiments taught me.So in principle it could work, but the problem is that these days, the big players are all doing high frequency trading with algorithms that try to predict market swings. And the big guys have an advantage: they are closer to the stock exchanges. They trade so fast that speed-of-light limitations affect who gets the trades in first. So I think the only people who could win with an LLM technique is someone who doesn&#x27;t need to pay commissions (a market maker, Goldman Sachs or similar) with access to real time data, very close to the exchange so they get it fast. reply ezekiel68 9 hours agoparentprev> Isn&#x27;t context hyper important?

The CIA now officially describes the 1953 coup it backed in Iran that overthrew its prime minister and cemented the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as undemocratic. Other American officials have made similar remarks in the past, but the CIA’s acknowledgment in a podcast about the agency’s history comes as much of its official history of the coup remains classified 70 years after the putsch. That complicates the public’s understanding of an event that still resonates, as tensions remain high between Tehran and Washington over the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, its aiding of militia groups across the Mideast and as it cracks down on dissent. The “CIA’s leadership is committed to being as open with the public as possible,” the agency said in a statement responding to questions from The Associated Press. “The agency’s podcast is part of that effort — and we knew that if we wanted to tell this incredible story, it was important to be transparent about the historical context surrounding these events, and CIA’s role in it.” In response to questions from the AP, Iran’s mission to the United Nations described the 1953 coup as marking “the inception of relentless American meddling in Iran’s internal affairs” and dismissed the U.S. acknowledgments. A crowd of demonstrators tears down the Iran Party's sign from the front of its headquarters in Tehran on Aug. 19, 1953, during the coup that ousted Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh and his government.AP file “The U.S. admission never translated into compensatory action or a genuine commitment to refrain from future interference, nor did it change its subversive policy towards the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the mission said in a statement. The CIA’s podcast, called “The Langley Files” as its headquarters is based in Langley, Virginia, focused two recent episodes on the story of the six American diplomats’ escape. While hiding at the home of the Canadian ambassador to Iran, a two-man CIA team entered Tehran and helped them fly out of the country while pretending to be members of a crew scouting for a made-up science fiction film. The caper, retold in the 2012 Academy Award-winning film “Argo” directed by and starring Ben Affleck, offered a dramatized version of the operation, with Affleck playing the late CIA officer Antonio “Tony” Mendez. The podcast for the first time identified the second CIA officer who accompanied Mendez, naming him as agency linguist and exfiltration specialist Ed Johnson. He previously only had been known publicly by the pseudonym “Julio.” “Working with the six — these are rookies,” Johnson recounts in an interview aired by the podcast. “They were people who were not trained to lie to authorities. They weren’t trained to be clandestine, elusive.” But in the podcast, which aired about a month before Hamas’ unprecedented attack Saturday on Israel, another brief exchange focuses on the 1953 coup in Iran.

CIA historian Brent Geary, appearing on the podcast, agrees. “This is one of the exceptions to that,” Geary says. A royalist tank moves into the courtyard of Tehran Radio on Aug. 19, 1953, a few minutes after pro-shah troops occupied the area during the coup that ousted Mohammad Mossadegh and his government.AP file Seven decades later, the 1953 coup remains as hotly debated as ever by Iran, its theocratic government, historians and others. Iran’s hard-line state television spent hours discussing the coup that toppled Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh on its anniversary in June. In their telling, a straight line leads from the coup to the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ultimately toppled the fatally ill shah. It still fuels the anti-Americanism that colors decisions made by the theocracy, whether in arming Russia in its war on Ukraine or alleging without evidence that Washington fomented the recent nationwide mass protests targeting it. From the U.S. side, the CIA’s hand in the coup quickly was revealed as a success of Cold War espionage, though historians in recent years have debated just how much influence the agency’s actions had. It also led the CIA into a series of further coups in other countries, including Guatemala, where American clandestine action in 1954 installed a military dictator and sparked a 40-year civil war that likely killed some 245,000 people. That’s led to an American political reappraisal of the 1953 CIA action in Iran. Then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright acknowledged the U.S.’ “significant role” in the coup in 2000. President Barack Obama, speaking in Cairo in 2009, described the CIA’s work as leading to the “overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.” But largely absent from the discussion was the CIA itself. After years of conflicting versions of the coup both in public and classified papers, a member of the CIA’s own in-house team of historians wrote a reappraisal of the operation in a 1998 paper titled “Zendebad, Shah!” in Farsi — or “Long Live the Shah!” A communist newspaper kiosk burned by pro-shah demonstrators in Tehran on Aug. 19, 1953, after the coup that ousted Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh.AP file But despite a series of American historical documents being made public, including a major tranche of State Department papers in 2017, large portions of that CIA reappraisal remain heavily redacted despite attempts to legally pry them loose by the George Washington University-based National Security Archive. That’s even after pledges by former agency directors Robert Gates and James Woolsey Jr. in the 1990s to release documents from that coup and others engineered by the agency. Further complicating any historical reckoning is the CIA’s own admission that many files related to the 1953 coup likely had been destroyed in the 1960s. “It’s wrong to suggest that the coup operation itself has been fully declassified. Far from it,” said Malcolm Byrne of the National Security Archive. “Important parts of the record are still being withheld, which only contributes to public confusion and encourages myth-making about the U.S. role long after the fact.” The Associated Press ABOUT CONTACT HELP CAREERS AD CHOICES PRIVACY POLICY YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES CA NOTICE TERMS OF SERVICE (UPDATED JULY 7, 2023) NBC NEWS SITEMAP CLOSED CAPTIONING ADVERTISE SELECT SHOPPING SELECT PERSONAL FINANCE © 2023 NBC UNIVERSAL",

They succeeded in the short-term – the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem endured for almost 90 years, and they managed to hang on to the coastal city of Acre (now in Israel&#x27;s Northern District) for almost another hundred – but were ultimately unsuccessful.Whereas, the current Israel-Palestine conflict is primarily a Jewish-Muslim conflict, not a Christian-Muslim one. There is a small Christian minority on the Palestinian side, but Palestinian Christians have no particular links to the Crusades; nor do Israeli Jews or Zionism have any particular link to it. Some of the Crusades (especially the First) involved antisemitic pogroms-but there were plenty of other pogroms in European history which had nothing to do with the Crusades, and by the time Zionism came along, other more recent instances of antisemitism were much more of a motivating factor than any of those as historically distant as the Crusades by then were. So, the Crusades were really a rather different historical chapter without much to do with the current one. reply kridsdale3 12 hours agorootparentprevMy man didn&#x27;t even mention the battle of Uggg vs Gruggg in the region in 38,000 BC. reply inglor_cz 1 hour agorootparentprev\"it goes back to the Zionism of the late 19th century\"Which, in itself, was a reaction to other developments.

The current conflict is influenced by nationalist movements, territorial disputes, and political developments of the last two centuries, rather than solely religious differences. reply rayiner 10 hours agorootparentThe current conflict arises directly from the Muslim Arab armies conquering what was the Jewish homeland. Because that’s what made it impossible for the Jews to have a country of their own—something that most people want, and most Arabs have—without coming into conflict with the descendants of those Arab conquerors.Imagine if the Cherokee fought the US government and somehow captured part of Tennessee. That would surely create hostilities between the Cherokee and displaced Tennesseans.

Schwartz, however, believes that the captive number of 97,000 is more reliable\"The Judaean Jewish community was nowhere near wiped out by the 66–73 CE war, given the fact they were able to launch another sizeable rebellion against Roman rule (the Bar Kokhba revolt) in 132–136 CE.And even after the Bar Kokhba revolt, significant Jewish communities survived in what is now Israel&#x2F;Palestine – of particular note is Judah ha-Nasi, the redactor of the Mishnah, who was born during the Bar Kokhba war. The office of Nasi (leader of the Jewish community in Israel&#x2F;Palestine) continued until the death of Gamaliel VI in c. 425. The Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius II refused to permit the appointment of a successor, which was arguably the decisive step in transferring the seat of leadership of the Jewish community from Galilee to Babylonia.While it is clear that many Jews were driven into exile, killed or enslaved, it is also likely that a significant number succumbed to the temptation&#x2F;pressure to convert to Christianity (and later Islam). How many is difficult to say; I wonder how many Palestinian Arabs have Jewish ancestors, it is possibly a quite substantial number. reply jltsiren 9 hours agorootparentprevIn the same way it usually happens.

Not circulation, not profitability, not influence, not truthfulness of reporting, nor quality of reporting. \"Mainstream\" outlets float government narratives crediting anonymous sources or sources delivered to the outlet on a platter. They also consult with the government and intelligence agencies before publishing stories, and will avoid entire subjects or questions on request. They do this in exchange for accurate inside information and scoops, or external benefits for the owners of the outlets.The vast majority of Democrats energetically supported the WMD lie, although it was false on its face based on the reports of the inspectors, and the fact that the documents used to justify it were obvious frauds (\"The Dirty Dossier\"). The rest was from \"Curveball\" who was an obvious fraud with an ulterior motive from the first encounter, and who no one ever bothered to corroborate, but who offered what the people who sell war material (and the politicians they fund) were buying.Democrats ridiculed us, too. All but one of them voted for the war, and they still marginalize her for it.This personal identification with Democrats among certain people seems to wash away all of their actual votes and rhetoric. Every problem becomes about how evil Republicans are, and no rational reason is ever offered for that evil, because all of the rational reasons (corruption, ambition) apply as easily to their Democratic counterparts. I found a name for those people during the Trump impeachment: \"emoluments libs.\" They were the people who insisted that the Democrats weren&#x27;t impeaching on emoluments because they weren&#x27;t brave enough and weren&#x27;t really trying, rather than because any investigation into Trump taking advantage of his office for cash would in the end implicate most of Congress to a greater extent than Trump, who was an outsider in a bad position to make the kind of money that old masters get up to.The idea that Tony Blair is the face of conservatism is laughable. Obama taking over the wars was ideal for people who made money from them, because they had become too closely associated with US religious warriors who were trying to put clothes on naked statues.

It&#x27;s a great example of monomania and paranoia guiding bad policy.The only thing I can say in defense of people from that era is that everyone thought WWIII was around the corner and we were going to all get nuked anyway.

But it is useful to understand why. reply badrabbit 14 hours agoparentprevThe CIA gets unfrair treatment, partly I think because they are held to the same standards by the public as say the FBI. This is what intel agencies do though. They are not there for democracy, political agenda, law enforcement,etc... they are like the military, as you pointed out they do heinous things.But the part that irks me the most is your incorrect insinuation that they did what they did on their own. They acted on behalf of the american people and their elected leaders. Much like how the US military also did heinous things in times of war (as any military would).The CIA is partly a paramilitary organization, sanctioned by the american people. Like any such agency they harm civilians and interfere in foreign governments&#x27; politics and economy.Why does the US need to repair our reputation? Unless by repair you mean remind the world who to be afraid of. We do not live in a nice world where everyone gets along. The US government and military (and the CIA) have no obligation to the world, their obligations are entirely to protect the american people and economy.Look at the unresr and strife in american society today. This is with a good economy! Look at the mass global migration to the US, civil rights changes,etc... they all happened because of post world war 2 prosperity, if you think all these rights and niceties can be kept under a crashed economy I&#x27;d have to respectfully disagree. In any other century in history, a country like the US would be inavding and decimating continents by now. When the CIA intervenes, it is because their leaders were hostile towards the US.My challenge to you is if you are willing to face the chaos of a poor&#x2F;powerless america and hope the alternative power-vaccum fillers would be nicer. China for example literally has police stations in western countries to crush dissent and I shouldn&#x27;t need to say much abour Russia&#x27;s election interference (and China!), if they were in the US&#x27;s place, how would you think they would react to a hostile Iran in 1953?

You don&#x27;t see much terrorism after afghanistan&#x27;s invasion right? My sticking point there is that the US shouldn&#x27;t have helped them rebuild. This is a conflict between horrifically violent parties who have no chance of sorting things out diplomatically. The US will never stop supporting israel and abandon an ally, Israel is there to stay, they&#x27;re not abandoning their historical homeland which is no longer historical because Israel has been a country for almost 80 years now. Violence is all that&#x27;s left. And wouldn&#x27;t you prefer violence that involved minimal civilian casualties?If that means the CIA playing \"dirty\" decimating one country and leaving them in shambles as a lesson to the rest, is it not worth it? In a world where other countries think the US is nice and docile more civilians die. In a world where countries are terrified at the thought of the US military or IC thinking about them, much less civilians die and suffer.The violent understand only violence as a language of negotiation.> Imperialism will always face opposition and struggleOh please with that b.s., did the US colonize any arabic country? What was colonized for al-qaeda who were besties with the CIA to do 9&#x2F;11? You think becoming a coward and abandoning your allies who are surrounded by genocidan enemies will satiate the murderous terrorists.Do you even undersrand that according to their extremist views, they have no desire to co-exist with you in this world? If they had the power, they would invade the whole world and decapitate all unbelievers. Why do you think ISIS was invading Iraq and Syria? America already pulled out! Their propaganda was to take over the levant and the world.You think these terrorists are misunderstood freedom fighters! That&#x27;s not the case.Their intifada against the US is not because they are oppressed but because people who have the same faith as them are oppressed in palestine. Neither palestinians nor most of Israel&#x27;s neighbors have an interest in a two state solution. Victory in these terrorists minds is not liberation of palestine but the genocide of jews and christians in the middle east.They have no interest in accepting their former land has been give away to the jews, not because the jews kicked them out but because their ancestors kept getting invaded by the ottomans then the british. It was not palestinian land that was given away, it was british land. It was as much palestine land then as it is today. Like it or not, this is not imerialism but a country being created as a result if an occupation, much like how america was created after native american land was invaded. Just about every country in the world is a result of one group invading a land that does not belong to them, countries are built on blood and ill-gotten gains. I suggest you cede native american land (if you are american, canadian, australian) before you ask israel to give up their only home.The palestinian people are oppressed because generations of hatred and raising their kids to dream of murdering their neighboring jews has put them in a corner where they either get oppressed or there is another jewish holocaust.If they were willing to accept history and move on to negotiate their own free and peaceful country that accepts the right of Israel to exist and if the muslim world as a whole decided to stop dreaming of genocide the palestine would be free.Put it a bit differently: I would prefer another 9&#x2F;11 and invading another middle eastern country than not support Israel&#x27;s right to existence. I don&#x27;t support their incursions into the westbank or treatment of palestinians in general though. If any of Israel&#x27;s neighbors could, they would have killed them off. Even Iran taunts israel with a nuclear holocaust all the time.So I suggest you pick a side, terrorists who kill babies for fun or not so nice Israelis who are willing to negotiate coexistence with their neighbors.I suggest you think long and hard about the outcomes to civilians and how much pain and suffering results in the side you pick. reply rockemsockem 14 hours agorootparentprevI generally agree with everything you said, but it seems to me that the biggest criticism of the coup in Iran is that it did not ultimately wind up serving American interests effectively. The coup installed a US-favorable Shah for a few years where oil could be obtained cheaply and then we got decades of a theocratic government actively funding American enemies all over the world.Oh, and we did this to a country that we had given nuclear power to.Evaluating the CIA&#x27;s move on the rubric you&#x27;ve set out does not produce a passing grade!! reply badrabbit 6 hours agorootparentThe problem is, the US changes administrations every four years. By far the late 60s and 70s lacked supporting of these friendly regimes, with vietnam and all and then carter really messed up a lot countries by his non-interference (but maybe that&#x27;s what americans wanted at the time?).The intent may have been good but regimes don&#x27;t self-sustain without their original support easily. Unwillingness to finish what they started and taking half-measures to avoid pissing off the american public I think was their real fault. Even in recent years, Israel was more than willing to start a fight with Iran before they matures their nuclear program but it is the US fearing involvement that is holding them back. Maybe in a few years the world would have to deal with Iranian ICBMs. What happens when they try to nuke tel aviv? Does the US nuke Tehran?

That&#x27;s why militaries and alliances exist. That&#x27;s why NATO exists.The US has been trying to do something similar as NATO in the pacific but they are not doing well picking sides there. Look at most of western China for example, it was not China 80 years ago, it was all a result of invading and incorporating other countries like Tibet. I mean, western media will act high and mighty but this is just the reality of the world. This was the context under which the Korean and Vietnamese wars were fought by the US. Empires keep expanding until they collapse, this is still true today.I just like to remember what empire I live in and that partly thanks to war averse folks like you, we do try to avoid and minimize war and invasions but also spend a crapton of money into a military that serves as a deterrence of wider scale global conflicts, wars and instabilities.

The target was not an oppressive Soviet puppet but a democratically elected government whose populist ideology and nationalist fervor threatened Western economic and geopolitical interests. The CIA&#x27;s covert intervention—codenamed TPAJAX—preserved the Shah&#x27;s power and protected Western control of a hugely lucrative oil infrastructure. It also transformed a turbulent constitutional monarchy into an absolutist kingship and induced a succession of unintended consequences at least as far ahead as the Islamic revolution of 1979—and, Kinzer argues in his breezily written, well-researched popular history, perhaps to today.Nearly 20 years ago already, this was an admission of a coup against a democratically elected government, instituting an \"absolutist kingship\", with \"unintended consequences\".All of this used to be available in HTML before the recent CIA website redesign.People would do well to read old books, and even watch old television news programs and documentary programs like those from CBS, all the way back to the 60s, before thinking that this wasn&#x27;t in some sense, common knowledge, at least among those who attempt to be knowledgeable.

Sign in BOONE ASHWORTH GEAROCT 13, 2023 6:00 AM The Whole of the Whole Earth Catalog Is Now Online The seminal DIY catalogs, journals, and magazines printed by the techno-hippie publishing house are finally available online in digital form, all for free. PHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: CAMERON GETTY; GETTY IMAGES; AP; ALAMY A NEARLY COMPLETE digital library of Whole Earth publications—including the famed Whole Earth Catalog founded 55 years ago by counterculture icon Stewart Brand—has been made available online for the first time. A curious reader can now flip through all the old catalogs, magazines, and journals right in their web browser, or download entire issues to their computer free of charge. The Whole Earth Catalog was the proto-blog—a collection of reviews, how-to guides, and primers on anarchic libertarianism printed onto densely packed pages. It carried the tagline “Access to Tools” and offered know-how, product reviews, cultural analysis, and gobs of snark, long before you could get all that on the internet. At the time of its initial publication in the late 1960s, the periodical became a beacon for techno-optimists and back-to-the-land hippies. The Whole Earth Catalog preached self-reliance, teaching young baby boomers how to build their own cabins, garden sheds, and geodesic domes after they had turned on, tuned in, and dropped out—well before they grew wealthy enough to buy up all the three-bedroom single-family homes. The catalog also had a profound impact on Silicon Valley’s ethos, and is credited with seeding the ideas that helped fuel today’s startup culture. Steve Jobs famously referenced the Whole Earth Catalog in a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, likening it to Google before Google existed. Some Whole Earth writers went on to build online communities like The Well and launch publications of their own—some even ended up at WIRED. Barry Threw, the executive director of the San Francisco art collective Gray Area, helmed the restoration project, in association with the cultural organization the Long Now Foundation and the Internet Archive, which is hosting the digital collection. Threw says taking on the task of digitizing thousands of pages of the Whole Earth back catalog was motivated by a frustrating experience trying to find an article from one of the old issues. “It started dawning on me that there was just a load of content that was seminal stuff that was just not publicly available,” Threw says. “It literally hadn't been scanned anywhere, and the stuff was impossible to get. It seemed like a good idea to do it while Stewart was still alive.” FEATURED VIDEO Whole Earth Catalog MOST POPULAR GEAR 40 Amazingly Addictive Couch Co-Op Games SIMON HILL GEAR The 18 Best Portable Chargers for All of Your Devices SIMON HILL GEAR The 14 Top New Android 14 Features SIMON HILL GEAR Give Your Back a Break With Our Favorite Office Chairs JULIAN CHOKKATTU Stewart Brand, editor of the Whole Earth Catalog, in 1975. PHOTOGRAPH: JANET FRIES/GETTY IMAGES Stewart Brand, age 84, is a writer credited with bridging the hippie movement of the ’60s with the computer revolution of the ’70s and ’80s. The subject of two recent biographies, one a book and one a documentary film, Brand is famous for (among other things) convincing the government to release for the first time a photograph of the planet Earth taken from space. He created the Whole Earth Catalog, the first issue of which had that iconic image emblazoned on the cover, as a means of sharing the skills and knowledge. The catalog had a short run, publishing a couple times a year between 1968 and 1971. After that, new editions were published off and on until 1998, by which time the Whole Earth mother had spawned a variety of related publications. In 1972, an issue of Whole Earth won a US National Book Award. “The idea of the Whole Earth Catalog in the ’70s was to confer agency,” Brand says. “So you went from being passively disinterested to becoming actively interested in a lot of things. Every one of those reviews was like a half-open door of something you might well do with your young life. A lot of people went through those doors.” Despite its influence on the general thrust of tech society and modern civilization, the Whole Earth Catalog and its associated publications have remained relatively inaccessible for the past few decades. The last of the publications, Whole Earth Review, collapsed in 2002 beneath a mountain of debt. Afterwards, the magazine’s editors and writers moved on to other projects, and the old issues of the publication sat stagnant. Someone did come along and offer to digitize all of Whole Earth’s publications, but Brand says the digital archive was never completed, and the work that was done remained largely inaccessible.

Eventually, Threw pitched the idea of digitizing all the available Whole Earth catalogs, magazines, and books and releasing them for educational, research, and scholarship purposes. “I wish we could have done it years ago,” Stewart Brand says. “So when the option seemed to appear to put certain things online and not ask anybody’s permission other than us, who wanted it to be free out there all along, we all said to each other, ‘Yeah go for it.’ And then they made it happen. It’s a huge body of work to finally have out there. We’re just delighted.” PHOTOGRAPH: EVERYNIGHT IMAGES/ALAMY The collection is hosted by the Internet Archive, with the website wholeearth.info operating as a landing page that serves as a hub and explainer for the various sections of the library. Each publication can be perused page-by-page, or with pages arranged side-by-side like a book. Each issue can be downloaded as a PDF.

The collection amounts to thousands of pages, scanned and showcased in a high-resolution format for the first time after more than half a century of languishing in their print formats. The previous attempts to digitize Whole Earth’s periodicals have left some kilobits scattered around the web—the now defunct WholeEarth.com had a smattering of electronic issues, the Internet Archive already has a collection of Whole Earth publications available on its site, and some catalogs have been scanned by the Museum of Modern Art—but Threw’s efforts have resulted in the most complete collection of the Whole Earth Catalog and its descendents to be made available online in one place. Think of this collection as the definitive box set of a seminal rock band where all of the albums, singles, B-sides, and import EPs have been remastered and repackaged for digital consumption. Some artifacts were lost to time. The collection doesn't include a few stray publications, such as the first issue of the Whole Earth Catalog. Threw says that omission is minor, given that much of what was printed in that first issue was reprinted in subsequent editions. The plan is for everything to be included eventually. Tomorrow Will Be Like Today Brand and the team working on the catalog in 1971. PHOTOGRAPH: RICHARD DREW/AP It’s been decades since a Whole Earth Catalog was published, but the publication’s mixture of ecological mindfulness and hunger for technological advancement feels eerily relevant in today’s hyper-online, environmentally aware era. Over the years and iterations, the publications have covered topics like science, social justice, sexuality, biotechnology, and geopolitics. Many of the environmental concerns are just as striking today as they were back then. \"One of the remarkable things for me—and at times depressing things—has just been to read a whole bunch of conversations that happened 30 years ago that we still seem to be stuck in the middle of,\" Threw says. \"It's just like, we haven't really progressed. We've just sort of accelerated.” Since the publishing house folded, Brand has moved on to other, more complicated and controversial projects like advocating for nuclear energy, helping create a 10,000 year clock, or working with researchers to bring back extinct species like the American chestnut tree and the wooly mammoth. He says only his readers will decide if this de-extinction of the Whole Earth Catalog will have an impact. “It’s really up to them,” Brand says. “It was not written or edited or collected or published for the future. It was written for a certain set of people that we knew, or knew about, at a certain time.” You Might Also Like … 📨 Make the most of chatbots with our AI Unlocked newsletter In the war against Russia, some Ukrainians carry AK-47s.

My school library happened to have a copy of a particularly magical book that was loosely patterned after the WEC, the \"Kids&#x27; Whole Future Catalog\". https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paleofuture.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2007&#x2F;4&#x2F;27&#x2F;the-kids-whole-future...I obsessively checked it out of the library, pouring over page after page of exciting future and near future advancements, and in my little mind seeing a clear path from the Space Shuttle to the city of the future printed on the cover. It was one of those breathless books that showed humanity figuring out how to engineer every natural process, picture upon picture of far off space stations intermingled with then current hydroponics gardens and concepts well beyond that.I found myself competing with at least one other child and the book never hit the shelf but for a few minutes as it was almost on permanent loan in somebody&#x27;s backpack. My mother looked for a few weeks trying to find where to buy it for me, but never found a bookstore with it. It was like an object sent from another dimension, mean to teach children and guide them to an inevitable future Utopia.It worked. I&#x27;ve worked in technology and R&D my entire career. I&#x27;ve yearned to bring about that future.A few years ago, thinking back to this formative codex, I went about trying to find it and happened to buy a copy on Ebay which set about a small project to get the equipment together to scan it and put it up on the internet archive as no digital version of the book exists to my knowledge. I&#x27;m almost there, but haven&#x27;t quite gotten everything lined up.Many years later, I learned about the WEC and it immediately hit me that this was the adult version of the feeder league I had been participating in as a child.I can&#x27;t believe the WEC is out there now.

I was obsessed. I re-read all 15 of them countless times.30+ years later, I bought a set off ebay in great shape to read with my kids.

    "originBody": "Skip to content The Blind Kitchen Kitchen Shop Cart About the Chef FAQs Library Recipes Contact How to cook ground meat perfectly every time! Cooking ground meats to be sure they are fully cooked and not overcooked can be tricky for a blind or visually impaired person. Here are a few steps to make sure ground meat is cooked perfectly every time. Some common recipes that call for ground meet to be browned are tacos, chilis, and sausage gravy. If you are browning ground beef, it generally contains enough fat that no more needs to be added. If cooking ground chicken, turkey or pork or lean ground beef, adding fat to the pan is important to be sure the meat does not stick to the pan as it cooks. Most recipes do not call for crusty meat crumbles. For each pound of ground meat, I add one tablespoon (Auto Measure Spout) of plant oil, such as vegetable oil or olive oil. The oil will not affect the finished taste of the meat, so a less expensive oil is fine. Cooking steps Step 1: Add the oil to the bottom of a cold pan if your meat requires added fat to cook nicely. Use a paper towel to spread a thin layer of oil all over the bottom of the cold pan. It will be helpful to use a flat-bottom, high-sided saute pan. I like a pan with at least 3-inch walls, straight not sloped, because it helps keep the food in the pan better than its sloped counterpart where food can travel more easily up the sloped side and find its way out of the pan. Step 2: For any ground meat you are using, it is important to break up any chunks of meat as you put it into the cold pan. Clumps of meat will take longer to cook and they are more difficult to break up during the cooking process after the pan is hot. You can’t see it and you can’t feel it, so breaking it up before you turn on the heat can avoid this problem. Also, if your ground meat is different sizes, it will cook at different rates with the larger chunks taking more time to cook than the smaller pieces so the little pieces will be overdone before the larger chunks are done. Consistency in size is key. Assessing the temperature of the meat Even with the use of a Talking Thermometer it is impossible for this task because the pieces are so small. For most recipes that involve the browning of ground meat, such as tacos or chili, the meat will be cooked further as the recipe progresses, so cooking it fully the first pass is less essential even if it is ground chicken or turkey. Step 3: After the meat is evenly distributed in the pan, turn the heat on to medium to allow the pan to heat up quickly. Take a moment while the pan is warming to smell the raw meat and keep it in mind as you continue. The smell of cooked meat is dramatically different than raw meat and you can use your nose to help determine doneness. Step 4: Choose a utensil to move the hot food around. I use a Long Wood Spoon, but any heat resistant wood or silicon utensil of your choice is fine. The blind friendly considerations in choosing this tool is to make sure it has a long handle so that the tool is not able to fall down into the bottom of the pan. The other consideration is that the tool should not be made of a material that conducts heat, such as stainless steel. This allows the tool to remain in the pan for the entirety of the cooking process and eliminates the need to move the tool in and out of the pan, reducing the chance of dripping or food waste from moving it in and out of the pan. Step 5: When you hear the meat start to sizzle turn the heat to medium low. The small pieces will cook quickly and only a slight sizzle is necessary to cook the ground meat thoroughly. If you hear anything louder than a slight sizzle, the heat is too high and the contents of the pan will need to be cooled as quickly as possible. The fastest way to do this is to lift the pan up and off of the heat source until the sound dies down and then it can be placed back on the heat source and can continue to cook using less high heat. Silence is not desirable either, you need to hear a slight constant sizzle to be able to use the timing guide in the next step. Step 6: A pound of ground meat, at a medium low temperature, will take about 6 to 9 minutes depending on the temperature and thickness of the pan, and the temperature of the meat when it is placed in the pan. Move or stir the meat for about 30 seconds for every minute it cooks so that no morsel of meat is in constant contact with the bottom of the pan for the entire cooking time. Any meat that is not moved will burn or crust in that amount of time. You will be able to smell the cooked meat when it is done. As it will probably be cooked further when making the dish, this timing guide will certainly result in a fully cooked pleasantly textured and colored product. Step 7: If your meat needs to be drained, I find it is most efficient to leave the cooked meat in the pan off of the heat source. Allow it to cool enough to be touched but not cool enough to allow the cooked animal fat to return to a solid state. Tilt the pan slightly and place a wad of clean paper towels where gravity is pulling the liquid fat to gather and allow the towel to soak up the unwanted fat. This method eliminates the need for a strainer and another greasy dish to clean, the unpleasant task of getting hot meat to fall into the strainer, and the greasy sink that will need to be cleaned after the meat is drained. Effective and efficient! Note: If you want to save the grease for another purpose (such as bacon grease) you can use the blind friendly Side Strainer which easily removes any food particles resulting in “clean” grease that can be stored for use at a later time.

I&#x27;ve noticed that sight is what I like to call a greedy sense, in that if you have this high bandwidth data input it sort of blocks you from being able to pay attention to input from your other senses.As a blind person who fancies myself as a bit of a cook though, being able to smell, feel, and interact with the food as I&#x27;m cooking really does make up for a lot. Also, you just kind of have to get over the initial fear of heat :)The article mentions this and it&#x27;s absolutely true: a high-sided pan makes all the difference. I use my 6 qt cast iron Dutch oven for browning meet and this completely avoids spillage.Also if you ever wondered who buys those weird \"smart\" kitchen devices, anything with an app is about 15,000 times more useable than the touch surfaces for most modern appliances.

The company is under PE management and in bankruptcy, but for the sake of the millions of repairable devices out there, will hopefully find a second wind.

There is usually a visual pressure indicator, but on most models it is rather \"binary\" anyways, either the knob is out or in. reply danielheath 7 hours agorootparentprevI mean, the network instructions should really not be able to do anything the buttons on the front couldn’t, but I see your point all the same. reply tass 7 hours agorootparentprevThey have a failsafe via a pressure relief, 2 of them, so I wouldn’t worry too much. reply sva_ 7 hours agoparentprev> anything with an app is about 15,000 times more useable than the touch surfaces for most modern appliances.As a person with pretty good sight (140% with glasses), I have to say that these sort of devices tend to be difficult to use even for me. For example, my father has an inductive stove with a touch interface, and I commonly fail to properly use it on the \"subsequent first tries\".When I see a touch screen interface that is completely static (same \"buttons\" at the same positions), I often wonder what led to the decision to utilize them instead of just using hardware buttons&#x2F;knobs. Is it a cost-saving measure, or just some managerial person who decided they needed to use something more modern? reply eimrine 4 hours agorootparentSince we are talking about kitchen, sensor buttons on anything are easier while cleaning from fats than all kinds of moving buttons&#x2F;switches. reply isilofi 9 minutes agorootparentI find sensors are dangerous, for two reasons. Sensors react not only to your finger but also to the wet cloth while cleaning, so cleaning can change settings or switch on the heat. There is usually a \"cloth-detection\", but that often doesn&#x27;t work. And on the hob, if you spill something, liquid might get on the buttons and change the settings. I&#x27;ve had a spill turning into a disaster of burned milk and even more spillage that way. reply Ma8ee 3 hours agorootparentprevI’d be fine with them except that the stove completely turns off when the sensors get a drop of water on them. And your fingers has to be dry and clean to use them. Both conditions make them hopeless in a kitchen. reply Dalewyn 33 minutes agorootparentprevBiggest reason by far is saving cost, but there are also some important benefits for the end-user like having no moving parts and being easier to clean. reply speed_spread 6 hours agorootparentprevCost saving.

If my fingers don&#x27;t skip across, it&#x27;s not clean enough. It ideally should make that audible squeaky-clean sound.I also identify minuscule stuck pieces of food through touch rather than sight.

So you have to make peace with having no good visual indication of how sufficiently clean the pan is.I kinda came to assume the dark pans have the same issue, it&#x27;s just not visible. reply ZiiS 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy, you can&#x27;t enjoy the sparkle and it makes them vastly less useful the next time you want to Cook. reply ethbr1 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d never considered the problem of \"food bit accumulation\" for visually impaired people, until reading this.The first approach of limiting escape makes sense (e.g. vertical side, deep pans), as the problem turns a typical quick spot clean into a deep whole clean. reply molloy 6 hours agoparentprevMight possibly be easier or more fun to dump the app when it’s loaded into RAM then repackage it and run it on your phone. reply vjerancrnjak 5 hours agoparentprevI guess that explains why Leonhard Euler got better at math after he went blind. reply User23 4 hours agoparentprevRemember pantelligent? That was the saddest casualty of the patent troll kitchen wars so far. reply az226 1 hour agoprevMy controversial take: cook ground meat as you would a steak. Toss the whole block in there and get a nice crust on both sides and then once you have gotten that Maillard reaction, then break it into the ground crumbles like usual. Flavor will be so much better.Most “browning” of ground beef is more akin to steaming than searing. reply mongol 1 hour agoparentI will try this! reply PeterStuer 4 hours agoprevWith meat especially, but also with fish and some vegetables, one of the prime indicators as to how far along someting is cooked, for everyone not just the visually impaired. is not sight but resistance. This is because usually the outside the things when prepared well should look the same irespective of how coocked trough it is.For meat the easiest way to learn the different ways meat feels at different points throughout the coocking scale from &#x27;bleu chaud\" to &#x27;well done&#x27; is steak.Pushing down with a spatula a raw slab of beef feels like solid pudding. You can push it sideways with preessure on the top and without moving it, and also it will compress and bounce back. As it gets more coocked through, the elastic feel will gradually become more contrained until you end up with a rock solid charred brick.For ground meat this is similar but more subtile. For vegetables you do not use the push down method, but you feel the resistance by sticking a fork in and feel it change from pretty hard to prick in to slicing through like butter. Easiest there yo practice id with boiled potato.Smell is also usefull, but inly to an extend as there can be many strong smells in a kitchen and the differences for degrees of coocking can be very subtle and vary with each batch, and also smeling can be impeded when you have a cold. reply CarVac 9 hours agoprevI have never once considered the ordeal that cooking while blind would be.The closest would be cooking while camping in the dark, but even then I have a headlamp. reply murrain 8 hours agoparentThere was a blind chef on Master Chef: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=EkicUwoqayg reply ckwalsh 8 hours agorootparentI really enjoy watching the judging of her apple pie: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;i0zRSANWj1I reply jayknight 6 hours agorootparentprevTommy Edison recently made waffles.

Put that on the stove on high heat. Oil is optional as the fat from the meat will have melted by the time water evaporates. The ground beef will separate perfectly with very little effort. Cook it until it starts sizzling, then let it brown as needed.

Hard to get up to temp- are you using vegetable oil?Heat the pan. Heat the oil. Put the meat in. It&#x27;s basically starting to brown immediately.Like the blind kitchen says- use your ears and nose. It should sizzle immediately when you put the meat in (just a gentle sizzle, NOT a violent sizzle). And it should start smelling good pretty quickly.Defrost first. Don&#x27;t try to brown too much at once (the meat needs to touch the oil and the pan).EDIT: Oh, I think you&#x27;re trying to make chili \"all at once\" by skipping the browning. Yes, it&#x27;s safe. No, it won&#x27;t taste as good. Browning is about flavor, not safety. When you cook a steak, you sear it for the crust, then continue cooking to get it up to temp. If you cook a steak in a low-temp sous vide bath, you do the reverse. You get the meat up to temp in the bath. Then when you&#x27;re ready to eat, you finish it by searing it in a pan. reply chongli 6 hours agorootparentprevYou can always cook off the liquid. It&#x27;ll start browning when the pan begins to dry. Just make sure you add oil so it doesn&#x27;t stick.

The post said to use medium heat and listen for the sizzle; the sizzle starts when the water is gone. Then the browning&#x2F;Maillard begins.For anyone making tacos at home: If you don&#x27;t get to the point where you hear the sizzle, you&#x27;re making tacos out of steamed meat, not browned meat.

    "originLink": "https://blog.xot.nl/2023/10/11/tainting-the-csam-client-side-scanning-database/index.html",
    "originBody": "Home // About // Previous Tainting the CSAM client-side scanning database. October 11, 2023 opeds end-to-end-encryptie crypto-wars smartphone surveillance European-Commission The proposal of the European Commission for a regulation on preventing and combatting the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children is currently discussed in Dutch parliament. I recently wrote about some concerns and the risk of a DDoS attack. It turns out it is also possible to taint the database of images of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM), allowing an adversary to trick the client-side scanning system to also trigger an alarm for other, non CSAM, material. Client side scanning could thus be vulnerable to undetectable function creep. Client-side scanning works by matching images on a user device against the fingerprints stored in this central database. There is no independent way for the service providers or the devices to verify that the fingerprints in this data actual correspond to CSAM. Therefore the devices have to fully trust this database that this is indeed the case. As such the proposal already suffers from a significant risk of function creep, as the scope of the fingerprints contained in the database could be extended to allow the detection of other material, like those propagating terrorism or other hateful or abusive content. To be clear this is absolutely out of scope of the current proposal for a regulation that is strictly limited to the prevention of the spread of CSAM. But other legislation could be enacted in the future to broaden the scope, without any need to change anything to the detection system already in place to detect CSAM. This significantly lowers the barrier to enact such legislation. Hence the risk of function creep. But at least any push for such function creep will happen in plain sight. I am more concerned about an surreptitious form of function creep that appears to crop up with client-side scanning. Clearly, as new CSAM is being discovered, its spread needs to be prevented by adding the fingerprints of this newly discovered CSAM to the database. Strict procedures are (purportedly) in place to guarantee that only fingerprints of known CSAM are added to this database. (Otherwise, fingerprints of other offensive content could easily be added.) Unfortunately, it is impossible to guarantee this. Consider an entity that is allowed to propose new entries to the CSAM database. A recent paper by Jonathan Prokos et. al., shows that it is possible for an attacker to create a variant of some arbitrary source image that matches some target fingerprint. A malicious entity could surreptitiously taint the database with other offensive content using these techniques as follows: It takes an image A of some offensive content, not being CSAM, for which it wants to add a fingerprint to the database. The entity keeps A secret. It computes its fingerprint f(A). (Although the algorithms to compute this are proprietary, researchers have reversed engineered the commonly used PhotoDNA algorithm, and a binary implementation of PhotoDNA is available to compute the fingerprint.) It creates a convincingly looking synthetic variant of CSAM using recent AI techniques (or waits until it discovers a new image as being CSAM). Call this image B. Using the techniques from Prokos et. al., it subtly modifies this source image B to create another image B′ whose fingerprint F(B′) matches the target fingerprint F(A). In other words f(B′) = f(A). Note that the modifications to B do not visibly alter the image, so B′ will still pass as CSAM. The malicious entity submits the altered image B′ to the database. Because B′ is visibly indistinguishable from B, which was constructed or selected to be CSAM, the fingerprint f(B′) of B′ is accepted for inclusion in the database. But as by construction f(B′) = f(A), the malicious entity has now successfully ensured that the client-side scanning algorithm will also report any occurrence of A (the non-CSAM but otherwise deemed offensive image) to the abuse centre. This shows that the database can be tainted with non-CSAM material by an entity that can submit entries to it. In the case of the proposed European regulation these are the Coordinating Authorities set up by each of the member states. Some of the member states (Hungary and Poland, for example) have shown certain authoritarian streaks, and should perhaps be less trusted with this new detection capability… The above attack is theoretical. The real question is of course whether this Would be an issue in practice? Suppose the database is tainted with image A (deemed offensive, but not being CSAM) as above. Then any person about to send this image will be notified that the scanner detected a possible case of CSAM, and that a report has been filed with the central reporting EU centre. Even though the EU Centre will quickly determine this is not a case of actual CSAM, this could still lead to chilling effects, as people may feel reluctant to use messaging apps to discuss anything sensitive as there is a (perceived) risk of being reported to the central EU Abuse centre. Even if this happens only occasionally. To really judge the impact of this attack in practice, it is important to also look at what happens when such a report is filed with the abuse centre. The report contains the image A (offensive perhaps, but not CSAM) and the fingerprint against which it matched. The abuse centre will look op the image B′ corresponding to the fingerprint (constructed by the malicious entity which looks like CSAM) and immediately conclude that A does not look at all like B′ and also is not CSAM. One could conclude that the abuse centre could thus easily spot the malicious entry in its database after a few of these reports all concerned with the same image, and delete the corresponding fingerprint from the database. If that were the case, this avenue of attack would not be a problem in practice. This assumes, however, that the abuse centre keeps track of such false positives over time to detect such maliciously uploaded fingerprints. This may or may not be the case. Moreover, we cannot consider this particular attack and its potential mitigation in isolation: we also need to consider other avenues of attack, and whether the mitigation proposed above perhaps enables other forms of attack. This brings us back to the DDoS attack on client-side scanning that I wrote about earlier. Because that attack essentially uses the possibility to find fingerprint collisions in the opposite direction: it creates an innocent image whose fingerprint matches the fingerprint of known CSAM in the database. As discussed Removing these fingerprints from the database is clearly not an option, as this would prevent the detection of actual CSAM that matches these fingerprints. So here we find the EU abuse centre confronted with an image that is clearly not CSAM, but perhaps could be considered offensive to certain governments. How does it determine whether the fingerprint being matched belongs to actual CSAM (uploaded in good faith) or synthesised (uploaded maliciously)? The judgement would be highly contextual and be wrong ever so often. The mere fact that a particular fingerprint is or is not the target of a DDoS attack (the number of matches could give at least that away) does not necessarily offer any resolution. And even a non-CSAM image that is uploaded only occasionally but that triggers the client-side detection system could just as well be an image constructed to match the fingerprint of actual CSAM, just to try to trick the abuse centre into removing the fingerprint from the database. Also note that if the client-side scanning system would be structured slightly differently, with reports of possible CSAM only being forwarded to certain authorities (e.g. when reports concerning a Hungarian user would only be forwarded to the Hungarian authorities), this form of function creep would not necessarily be detected. This shows that the overall design of the full client-side scanning system, including the way reports are handled, matters a lot. In case you spot any errors on this page, please notify me!

You could target a whole \"social cluster\" of people without having any special privileges within this system.As an example, lets say you want to attack environmental protesters.For image A, you create a meme about climate change.For image B, you procure something that looks, to humans, like CSAM (as described in the article).Craft B′ such that f(B′) = f(A) (also as described).Now, all you have to do is anonymously publish B′ to a platform that is actively moderated&#x2F;monitored. Unfortunate users will see it and report it as CSAM, and if the platform fulfills its obligations, that report will bubble up to the relevant authorities, who will review it and add its fingerprint to the database.Now you can start sending out image A, the meme, to your target demographic. You won&#x27;t be able to post it on \"mainstream\" platforms with server-side fingerprint scanning, but there are plenty of other avenues for it to spread. If it&#x27;s a good meme, it will propagate organically through group-chats and DMs, and eventually find its way onto devices with client-side scanning.Apple&#x27;s proposed device scanning system had a threshold before your device would be flagged, so repeat all these steps a whole bunch of times, until the average meme-savvy environmental protester&#x27;s device gets flagged for further scrutiny.Unwitting victims who do try to post the meme to a mainstream platform with fingerprint matching may risk getting their accounts flagged and taken down, and they might have no way of knowing what triggered it. This would lead to, of course, automated censorship of environmental protest groups. reply logi_sko 5 hours agoparentEven better: Distribute image A for a while before publishing B&#x27; and it can spread via all the server side scanning channels as well.

This is also one of the reasons that Facebook&#x2F;Meta produces many more reports than other providers who use the NCMEC database. Governments view the limited reach of the NCMEC database as a problem, and are encouraging providers to use more complete databases and to develop tools to detect novel CSAM (this is included in the EU proposed regulations.)“Further scrutiny” here means your images are reported to a provider, which (at that point) means your provider has a list of reports that defeat the guarantees of E2E encryption.

The attacker in question uploads very standard renditions of thousands of pieces of classical music, and claims copyright on them. Content ID then flags any video using one of these pieces as potentially violating the rights of the rightholder.The attacker then claims the video, and claims revenue on the video rather than taking it down. There&#x27;s an appeal process which seems to work about 0% of the time, and after that the only recourse the uploader has is to submit a copyright counter notification, which becomes the start of a potential lawsuit.The attackers in question will then typically relent if challenged with a copyright counter claim, but most videos don&#x27;t get counter claimed once this happened.This pattern of behavior seems so common that it has led to two interesting patterns of behavior that I&#x27;ve seen.1) Any video that uses popular public domain music will be claimed not once, but dozens or hundreds of times, because there are so many channels operating this way now, and2) If you post a video and immediately get hit with a huge wave of claims, rather than going through Youtube&#x27;s process, most uploaders just delete the video, remove whatever audio caused the problem, and reupload. reply Bewelge 14 hours agorootparentI have some, though maybe outdated, experience with that: In 2008, I was 15 and had the idea of creating youtube videos using MIDI files of classical piano songs that had entered the public domain. They&#x27;re free to use and in theory, videos stay up forever and these classical songs are timeless, so that means after uploading I&#x27;d earn passive income forever!Or so I thought... Every single video was copyright claimed. Youtube falsely thought it was a recording (which do have copyright). The second a claim was created I stopped earning money. I would then dispute the claim, explaining that it&#x27;s not even a sound recording and they had a month to react to my answer.In almost all instances the claims were retracted but it would only take a couple of days until another claim would be filed on that video. Answering all those claims took up more time than producing the videos so I gave up after a while.But in my experience it wasn&#x27;t really malicious actors filing these claims but youtube&#x27;s filter simply not managing to distinguish between a recording of a classical piano piece and a well synthesized version of it. I actually remember most claims being filed by Sony.It&#x27;s interesting to hear that it&#x27;s still this way because I don&#x27;t really believe that nowadays, youtube still can&#x27;t distinguish between different recordings of classical music. I guess they have no incentive to improve in that regard.But I think the fact that nobody but the large labels are able to earn money with classical music on these large platforms is actually an excellent argument against upload filters and in my experience it&#x27;s an argument that non-tech people can much better relate to than hash-collisions. reply josephcsible 16 hours agorootparentprevI wish that willful false copyright claims carried the same $250,000 penalty that copyright infringement does. reply GuB-42 15 hours agorootparentThat would be ridiculous.But there are penalties for false claims. There is a fine for claiming copyright you don&#x27;t own, and if you go further and ask for takedowns, you are also liable for damage.The problem is that these are rarely enforced. Even a $100 fine for a false claim on YouTube would be enough to weed out bots and click farms. And for the most serious cases, have the infringer pay damage and a bigger fine. No need to change the law for that, it just has to be enforced. reply LeifCarrotson 13 hours agorootparentConsider the penalties given for a crime, and compare those to the penalties given when police or prosecutorial or judicial misconduct falsely, incompetently, or corruptly imprisons someone for that crime.The latter are overwhelmingly more rare, but overwhelmingly larger. Society in general thinks false penalties for crimes are worse than the crime itself.\"It is better that 10 guilty men go free, than that one innocent man should suffer.\" I think that if the penalty for copyright infringement is $250,000, the penalty for a false claim should be $2,500,000.You&#x27;re right that a $100 low-effort, frequently-enforced counterclaim process would weed out ContentID bot farms (just like a $0.01&#x2F;email transaction cost would weed out spam).

The attack model they’re designed for is image manipulation to avoid the hash match, not manipulating manipulating images to trigger the hash.There are numerous papers on doing bit manipulation to cause miss classification. reply minitech 14 hours agorootparentThe context of the comment you’re replying to is a cryptographic hash. reply giantrobot 17 hours agorootparentprevThese systems don&#x27;t rely on cryptographic hashes but in fact the reverse: content sensitive hashes.They essentially take an image and scale it to a small thumbnail. The values of all those reduced pixels are the hash of the original image. When a new image is scanned it&#x27;s just doing a similarity check against the database of those hashes of known \"bad\" images. A hit triggers checking against an image hash performed with a separate algorithm. Hits against multiple hashes triggers a \"bad image alarm\" and ruins a person&#x27;s life.Changing a few input bits in an image doesn&#x27;t usually change the perceptual hash because they&#x27;re meant to be resistant to small amounts of localized noise. It is possible to add noise that will change a perceptual hash. It&#x27;s also possible to manipulate an image so transforms (scaling etc) get wildly different results.This leads to two exploits. The first is an attacker manipulates a \"good\" image such that when hashed it matches perceptual hashes of a \"bad\" image. The attacker then sends a bunch of these to a target triggering the \"bad image alarm\" and essentially SWATs the target. The second is to manipulate bad images in a recoverable way to get them pasted bad image scanners. reply Hizonner 18 hours agoprevIt says:> This shows that the database can be tainted with non-CSAM material by an entity that can submit entries to it.Actually, it can easily be tainted by anybody.

However, while this bars prosecuting AI-generated child pornography under child pornography laws, it does not bar prosecuting it under obscenity laws. In the US, obscenity laws are much narrower than child pornography laws, so it is more difficult to get convictions, but people have gone to prison for violating them (e.g. Ira Isaacs [2] in 2012&#x2F;2013, Paul F Little aka Max Hardcore [3] in 2008&#x2F;2009). It can be difficult to convince a jury to convict, but realistic AI-generated child pornography may be one of those cases in which many juries would. Furthermore, Ashcroft v Free Speech Coalition is not set in stone–given technological developments since then, and the changed composition of the Supreme Court, it is possible that some prosecutor might seek to overturn it, and you can&#x27;t say for certain they would fail.

It&#x27;s trivial to deal with impersonated hashes, all positives can be scanned on device in a second round with a different hash method. Those which are still positive can have be checked off device in an automated, yet privacy preserving, way such as by sending a low resolution crop with faces blurred to a system that does a likeness check against the matched CSA image: only the real image will bear likeness.3. These systems have undisclosed minimums. A person sharing CSAM will be generating positive results at a significant rate. Receiving a few images with faked hashes won&#x27;t set off alarms, and if a victim is suddenly receiving hundreds of images, that would already be obvious.4. These articles over sensationalise what occurs when a positive match is found. They vaguely gesture to serious consequences from a single match. In reality even without secondary automated checks, the false positive will be noticed by a human and then discarded. If a person is receiving a lot of false positives that may lead to the individual being informed that they are begin targeted.Overall the idea of scanning chat content seems ineffective, for much of the same reasons why it&#x27;s ineffective to ban end-to-end encrypted chat: those with criminal intent will just use something else or roll their own. reply phyzome 14 hours agoparentIf you can make one algorithm collide, you can make two collide. reply logi_sko 5 hours agorootparentIt needs to be not just a second algorithm but a parametric hash function.

I doubt anybody&#x27;s gotten a close collision for more than one hash at a time.It&#x27;s not inconceivable that they could do it, though. As far as I know, there are only two hash methods that get used for this, and I think both of them are based on sliding a window over a reduced version of the image and doing a DCT, so they&#x27;re pretty similar. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if somebody could fool both of them enough to at least force you to tighten up your similarity threhsholds. It would be safer to come up with something that worked on completely different principles. No idea how hard that would be.I don&#x27;t think that the second-stage backup, where you send the image off somewhere, is \"privacy preserving\" by any standard I&#x27;d be comfortable with. Well, OK, actually even completely foolproof client side scanning isn&#x27;t privacy preserving enough for me, but I mean that&#x27;s substantially worse.I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be easy to find anybody to run that server. And it&#x27;d be a significant structural change from what&#x27;s deployed now. It&#x27;d be much more disruptive than adding a second hash (which is isomorphic to just switching to a single composite hash). It took a long time to get the present system deployed, so that big a change doesn&#x27;t seem \"trivial\".> These systems have undisclosed minimums. A person sharing CSAM will be generating positive results at a significant rate. Receiving a few images with faked hashes won&#x27;t set off alarms, and if a victim is suddenly receiving hundreds of images, that would already be obvious.Minimum what? If you just say \"undisclosed minimums\", my mind immediately assumes you mean threshold similarity scores. But you seem to mean hit counts to trigger various actions.Anyway, both of those are set by the service that&#x27;s using the database. Those services vary in their strictness and clue level, so I&#x27;m not sure you can say anything very general about them.> These articles over sensationalise what occurs when a positive match is found.In the threat model of the original article, the people doing the review for false positives are most likely the same people who poisoned the database to begin with. They&#x27;ve corrupted it to give them hits on images they want to suppress, even though the system operators don&#x27;t want to support them in suppressing those images. So that whole \"reviewed by a human and discarded\" step doesn&#x27;t happen.In the broader world, I suspect that the thresholds for \"delete the file\" tend to be very low... too low for there to be human review. The thresholds for \"disable the user&#x27;s account\" probably aren&#x27;t exactly stratospheric, either. You can have damaging consequences well short of midnight police raids.Also, \"framing\" people isn&#x27;t necessarily the only thing you might use it for. For example, you could try to use it to drive the cost of running the system up to unsupportable levels. reply LorenPechtel 12 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve never played with fingerprinting per se, but long ago I did write a program to detect near-duplicate images. It was based on comparing square of the differences of extremely downscaled images. Quite good at it&#x27;s intended purpose, exposed the fact that a few images were photoshops and revealed that images that were inherently low-contrast could easily be confused by that approach--beaches looked an awful lot like beaches. reply bastawhiz 19 hours agoprevThe issue described here, to my understanding, is that you find or create csam and then manipulate it so that its fingerprint collides with another image that you want to be flagged as csam. You then submit the manipulated version of the found or generated image to the authority.First, at what point does the authority go \"uh... Where did you get this from?\" Practically speaking, the people doing this would have to be authorized law enforcement, no? Like if an ordinary citizen showed up with csam the excuse \"oh I found this JPEG in a trunk in my late grandpa&#x27;s attic\" isn&#x27;t gonna fly.My assumption is that the central authority that compiles the database isn&#x27;t just taking fingerprints, they want the actual source images. And I&#x27;m assuming they actually look at them to ensure they are, in fact, csam. Otherwise anyone could put anything into the database.Now let me be very clear: I hate the idea of my device scanning for csam on principle. But what&#x27;s the attack here? That someone looks at my device and determines that I do not, in fact, have csam? And that false positive might even be investigated and reveal that the bad actor sought out or generated CSAM for the purposes of perpetrating this! Which is even worse!If the police want to look at your device, they can do that already through any number of other sketchy means that don&#x27;t involve what&#x27;s likely weeks of effort.

The authorities might want to suppress this image, not just within Hungary but also in the whole of European Union.The Hungarian government - who presumably has access to the EU CSAM database (or can coerce those who do), might attempt to add a fingerprint of a manipulated CSAM image that collides with the fingerprint of the satirical image.

In that paragraph, I&#x27;ve taken an aside and moved from Hungary (or any other government) as the adversary to child-porn-sharers-in-general as the adversary, and also changed the adversary goal.No matter what you do, you can&#x27;t \"boot\" the child porn sharers, because they&#x27;re the ones who actually define what images you&#x27;re legitimately trying to block.> Also it is important to remember these are hashes. Not all images of the US flag would trigger the system only that specific image that has a hash collision.They&#x27;re approximate perceptual hashes, designed to come up with close values on close pictures. The US flag has an officially defined appearance. You&#x27;ll get the same hash for any two close-cropped, straight-on images of the flag, the kind you might embed in your Web site. They&#x27;ll be at least as close as two reprocessed versions of the same child porn image.I was oversimplifying, though. You&#x27;re not going to be able to tweak just any child porn image to make it hash like just any flag, unless you&#x27;re willing to distort it into unrecognizability. And flags and logos might be bad candidates in general, because they&#x27;re going to give DCT output that&#x27;s wildly different than what you&#x27;ll get from most photos. But if you had a relatively large library of child porn and a relatively large library of heavily-used effectively unbannable images of whatever kind, you should be able to find a lot of the child porn images that you can tweak to hash like one or another of the heavily used ones.... and if you&#x27;re generating fake child porn from scratch using ML, you can probably hack your ML model to bake the hash of one or another unbannable image into everything it creates. You could probably make those matches pretty damned close.So, once they got the whole thing down, they should be able to force the system to greatly tighten its match thresholds and&#x2F;or deal with a really high false positive rate. In fact, they could probably make things bad enough that they could end up with a pretty large collection of child porn that the operators would be forced to completely exclude from detection.Now back on the original authoritarian threat model:> I just think this in a complicated and ineffectual bullet that can only be fired once because it has a fingerprint of the person who fired it.For the \"authoritarian\" purpose, you may be right... although I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it stayed under the radar for longer than you think. If the image you want to suppress only circulates among your own people, and if you&#x27;re the authority who receives and verifies the reports on your own people, then all you have to do is to keep the overall volume down enough that it doesn&#x27;t make anybody suspicious enough to demand that you show them the reports you&#x27;re getting.If you&#x27;re a relatively small country, the number of people who share some local meme you care about may be quite a bit smaller than the number of people who share some new real child porn image. replygraypegg 19 hours agoparentprevI guess it comes down to this black box list of hashes that no one would want to audit for pretty obvious reasons.

There is a very clear pattern that prevalence of pornography reduces rape.

Something properly signed is known not to involve any actual children and would thus be legal.(My philosophy in general is that for something to be illegal the state should be able to show a non-consenting victim or the undue risk of a victim (ie, DUI).

There is no scientific consensus either way on whether it increases or decreases a person&#x27;s thoughts about actual physical abuse.The issue is that the people (and the legislators) in each jurisdiction have made a choice that AI CSAM is not illegal, and therefore this runs the risk of falsely accusing someone of a crime.[if you disagree that AI CSAM should be legal in your jurisdiction the solution isn&#x27;t to arrest everyone, but to petition your lawmakers to change the law] reply sneak 18 hours agorootparentprev> Possession of CSAM should be illegal regardless of whether it&#x27;s \"real\" or not.From a purely ethical standpoint: why?

What we actually criminalized, or at least were trying to prevent, was some sort of fraud or public endangerment.But we also along the way made it illegal for sellers to remove the tags from mattresses.Removing the tag isn&#x27;t inherently harmful; if you don&#x27;t deceive the purchaser on the contents of the mattress, it&#x27;s not even fraud.But we broadened the definition of the crime to make it easier to enforce. reply novok 13 hours agorootparentYou are going into forced labelling disclosure, which can have a lot of benefits beyond fraud prevention because it increases informed consent and all sorts of other net goods. It&#x27;s the logic and ethics of nutrition labels, and IMO is probably one of the more good vs bad things that govts can mandate. reply chatmasta 17 hours agorootparentprevI agree with you. I think our disagreement here is over the level of innocence of someone possessing AI generated CSAM.If you believe, as I do, that such a person is guilty of a crime, then we&#x27;re not risking the false guiltiness of an innocent person. At best, we&#x27;re risking their level of sentencing. And I&#x27;m open to the idea of reduced sentences for AI CSAM, but it shouldn&#x27;t be a factor in determination of guilt (i.e. it should be a matter between the judge and the defendant, rather than something the prosecution needs to prove).With regards to CSAM criminalization in general, there is a real risk of punishing innocent people that may have been framed by planted evidence. But this is a risk regardless of whether the evidence is \"real\" CSAM or not, so legalizing possession of AI-generated CSAM doesn&#x27;t reduce the risk of an innocent person being framed. It might make it \"easier\" for a bad actor to frame someone, since they can now do it with AI content instead of real content. But if they&#x27;re already planting evidence, do they really care whether they&#x27;re committing a crime while preparing the evidence? And besides, if we keep the AI content illegal, then it&#x27;s equally legally risky to frame someone with it as it is to frame them with real content.The problem of prosecuting \"innocent\" people, whether you believe they&#x27;re innocent because they were framed or because they&#x27;re only guilty of possessing AI-generated CSAM, should be addressed at the time of enforcement. Stop using entrapment and fishing expeditions as an enforcement mechanism.

In other words, there is a societal victim of it. To me it&#x27;s the same ethical premise but interpreted within two different frameworks: one that&#x27;s purely idealistic, and one that&#x27;s based in practical reality. reply sneak 17 hours agorootparentAI cannot generate CSAM, because AI cannot abuse children. AI makes fictional images, which definitionally cannot be images of child sexual abuse.There is literally no victim of any kind, even conceptually, in the case of computer generated imagery. It should be protected artistic expression. reply chatmasta 17 hours agorootparentWhat if a police officer generates some AI CSAM and then sells it to someone who thinks it&#x27;s real? There&#x27;s still \"no victim,\" but the buyer thinks that there was.

If there&#x27;s a market in it some people will engage in it to satisfy that market. Thus, possession of real CSAM has an indirect victim.I had previously proposed that if the abuser has been caught that the victim should get the rights to the images and once they are an adult be allowed to legally sell them (thus a list of legally permitted images), but the AI image revolution has changed that. Have AIs sign their images, CSAM with a proper signature is legal. reply giantrobot 16 hours agorootparentprev> Are they guilty of a crime?Unless there is a very specific \"attempt to acquire CSAM\" law then no they&#x27;re not fucking guilty of any crime.

Attempted murder is a crime, I both intend to kill someone and try to do so even if I fail. It&#x27;s not punished as severely as actual murder but it&#x27;s still a crime. But attempted murder is actual a specific crime in the criminal code. There&#x27;s elements of it that need to be proven in court.Unless a jurisdiction has a crime of \"attempted possession of marijuana\", intending to buy marijuana but ending up with oregano isn&#x27;t a crime someone can be charged with. If we start writing laws outlawing attempted possession it&#x27;s a slippery slope that gets into outlawing thoughts. It also opens the door to stupid pre-crime ideas like someone would only use cryptography to get ahold of illegal content therefore anyone using cryptography is instantly guilty of attempting to get illegal material.You can be sure this is what will happen because it&#x27;s the very arguments the anti-cryptography groups use. reply qingcharles 17 hours agorootparentprevThere are plenty of \"victimless\" crimes that society deems unsavory and punishes. e.g. smoking pot in your home, alone is a crime in a lot of jurisdictions, even though clearly no-one is harmed.In a lot of jurisdictions the decision has been made, whether it is right or wrong, to criminalize AI CSAM. The people have spoken and the lawmakers have made the laws. If you or I think that is wrong then the options are to lobby for a change. reply dragonwriter 17 hours agorootparent> There are plenty of \"victimless\" crimes that society deems unsavory and punishes.That is not an argument against the concept that that should not be the case. reply adrr 16 hours agorootparentprevPlenty of actions are crimes without real victims. Not having insurance while driving is an example. Possession of explosives is another one. reply chatmasta 16 hours agorootparentIn fact, you might even argue that possessing real CSAM has no victim. After all, the person possessing the image isn&#x27;t the one who committed the abuse and took a picture of it, right? But we&#x27;ve collectively decided that it&#x27;s worth punishing that crime, because every viewer is an enabler of the abuser. The same logic should extend to AI-generated content.To put it another way, consider a thought experiment where a police officer generates CSAM with AI and then sells it to someone who thinks it&#x27;s a real picture of a real victim. We should arrest the buyer, right? They thought they were committing a crime. reply Eisenstein 14 hours agorootparentYou have literally proposed &#x27;thought crimes&#x27;. reply chatmasta 9 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s plenty of precedent where police officers pretend to be an underage person and some shmuck replies to them and agrees to meet at a hotel. Then they get arrested, and much of the time they also get prosecuted and convicted. You could argue it&#x27;s entrapment but the fact is that most of society supports that sort of preemptive law enforcement.If you looked at it through a purely ethical framework then you could never convict the person because there was never any \"real victim.\" But is that the right way to look at it? It&#x27;s certainly not the way most people look at it. replywhimsicalism 18 hours agorootparentprevI am of the opinion that regardless of whether they are both illegal, the penalties for “AI” should be significantly less. reply anononaut 17 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s your reasoning? reply epups 18 hours agorootparentprev> I assume the answer to that will be that there is no need to differentiate between them. And honestly, I agree with that argument.Why do you believe that? reply chatmasta 18 hours agorootparentSee my comment to a sibling reply. Basically I don&#x27;t want to make victims prove their victimization was real, and I don&#x27;t want to give criminals with real victims an opportunity to argue they \"thought it was AI generated.\" reply usrnm 18 hours agorootparentAnd I absolutely want both parties to have to prove crime&#x2F;innocence and have an opportunity to argue. The current situation, where anything involving CSAM is so toxic that lives are ruined without trial is not healthy and isn&#x27;t good for anybody reply Hizonner 18 hours agorootparentPoint of order: victims are not \"parties\" in criminal cases, not in remotely modern legal systems. The parties are the accused and the state.For the same reason, victims don&#x27;t get to pardon crimes committed against them.... which is the way it should be, because criminal punishment should not be seen as a form of revenge, but as a deterrent. reply qingcharles 17 hours agorootparentRight. Most crimes are essentially ones that \"the people\" found unsavory.For instance, there is no \"victim\" if I got caught enjoying cannabis in my own home in a jurisdiction where such a thing is illegal, but \"the people\" have made a decision that they don&#x27;t like it and I should be punished for committing an anti-social act.That is one of the fundamental aspects of democracy at work. replyZuiii 5 hours agoprevI&#x27;m completely stumped. I just don&#x27;t understand how politicians can still believe that client-side scanning would somehow stop CSAM.Couldn&#x27;t those who possess this material also run those exact same CLIENT scanners (if not directly, than via isolated canary systems and emissions monitoring) to detect when files have been added to the scanners?What about tools that keep shuffling files in ways that are not too perceivable but would defeat those scanners? Just look at copyright infringing material on Youtube (it&#x27;s still there, just better hidden).Nothing short of a government whitelist database containing all files that are legal to possess, or 100% analog human surveillance will solve CASM. Not AI and certainly not this.I&#x27;m forced to agree with others here: This isn&#x27;t about CSAM at all. It&#x27;s a thinly disguised frontal attack on democracy. Imagine if the government had this technology when people were organizing to repeal discriminatory laws in the US. Imagine if authoritative governments in the east (or anywhere else) had this technology right now.Take a long hard look at every person or organization who supports this nonsense and pay close attention to them. They are the ones who want to harm us and our children. reply anigbrowl 16 hours agoprev[...] One could conclude that the abuse centre could thus easily spot the malicious entry in its database after a few of these reports all concerned with the same image, and delete the corresponding fingerprint from the database. If that were the case, this avenue of attack would not be a problem in practice. This assumes, however, that the abuse centre keeps track of such false positives over time to detect such maliciously uploaded fingerprints. This may or may not be the case.Why would it not be the case, unless the abuse center wanted to waste time and resources and have unreliable records? This essay is technically sophisticated and socially naive. Tech people keep spinning up the most unlikely and hard-to-explain reasons for why leveraging technology to interfere with the spread of CSAM is bad, instead of working toward any kind of privacy-respecting solution to target CSAM itself.Constantly emphasizing the scope for government intrusion and privacy violation (legit but at the same time overblown to the point of paranoia) and constantly minimizing or dismissing the real harms of CSAM is a great way to alienate the normal non-technical people you need to have on side. reply uconnectlol 15 hours agoparentokay, ill bite:yes, the blogger has tunnel vision, that&#x27;s the only valid point in your post, he also missed the fact that anyone can poison the well, not just privileged entities.however your rhetoric is cancerous, although i&#x27;m aware that many people who use it are just sheep and have no idea what they&#x27;re insinuating.CSAM is a propaganda word:1. right wing uses it to push their agenda of punishing people for having sex2. left wing uses it to push their agenda of punishing males or kulaks or whatever3. police use it to make it look like they&#x27;re solving a crime so they can get paid for nothing: they can arrest someone for looking at a nude picture of a 17 year old (which the suspect is often unaware of), then in the media and police statements: \"he was arrested for the possession of child sexual abuse material\". and this is the majority of convictions: people (and even teens) being into teens.people are not naturally sexually attracted to children (13 and under) in more than say 0.0001%.so now that we actually looked at the subject beyond the taboo veil, it seems the discussion is just to stop 14-17 year olds from having sex, which is insane and does not justify one single thing that police do about it. CP being illegal is just completely out of the question. we should be debating re legalizing CP, or changing it to 13 and under at the very least (i don&#x27;t see any harm in the existence of porn of any age since it does not encourage abuse since most people will not become sexually attracted to children no matter how much you expose them to it).so again, your rhetoric is pure cancer. i don&#x27;t need a \"privacy respecting solution to CSAM\". what the hell do you think that would be? do we also need a freedom respecting solution to the murder problem? would you have my legs cut off and say i should just order door dash? reply feoren 14 hours agorootparentYour claims of things that do happen are likely true.

Teenagers&#x27; lives are ruined for basically no reason.Your claims of things that don&#x27;t happen are, unfortunately, false. Law enforcement agents whose jobs involve ever looking at CSAM basically cannot stand the mental toll of the job for any significant amount of time. Unthinkably horrible things happen to children to create these images. The idea that we would legalize it is not on the table, and suggesting such a thing is a great way to immediately lose support from everyone in the world.We should not reject efforts to prevent the production and spread of CSAM unless we can show that the former group can abuse it. Unfortunately, so far, basically all suggested prevention mechanisms are vulnerable to abuse and corruption.

Yes, we&#x27;d all love a \"freedom-respecting solution to the murder problem\". In fact convicted murderers still have some rights and freedoms, and balancing those against preventing murder and rehabilitating murderers is another difficult problem.

At best it would have prevented continued sexual abuse.And yet had my abuser been caught early I would have been returned to a different, brutally abusive man.

There are systemic reasons for the legislation almost always being bad&#x2F;unhelpful&#x2F;foolish and those reasons are not going to change. reply kypro 18 hours agoprevThis is basically what I suggested we do a few years ago if Apple added client-side content scanners.Seems all need to here is obtain a finger print of a CSAM image then you can reverse engineer a non CSAM image to match that finger print. Distribute this image wide enough and you effectively render these algorithms useless.Which is a shame because they could be used for good, but it seems kinda obvious this will expand out to scanning for terrorist materials. And again, while I might be in favour of this in theory I am frequently shocked by what fits this definition. In the EU if you promote the wrong ideas or say something \"hateful\" you can be arrested and sentenced 10+ years in prison.I think what concerns me is that currently you really only put yourself at risk if you make your wrong think public, e.g tweet about your dislike of Islam on Twitter. These client-side scanners would now enable the authorities to not only go after those who say \"racist\" things online, but also those who view &#x2F; save \"racist\" memes. If I were to guess at a motive, this would be it.Legal note: I obviously don&#x27;t agree with hate of any kind, but I do believe in the right to express views which may be considered hateful.Edit: Fine with the downvotes – but curious what people are disagreeing with?

You mixed up generating child porn images that collide with targeted non-child-porn images, in order to taint the database and thereby suppress the target images, with generating non-child-porn images that collide with child porn images, in order to overwhelm the system with false positives.2.

You put sneer quotes around \"racist\", which makes it sound very much like you don&#x27;t think any such thing exists. reply kypro 17 hours agorootparentThank you.1. Oh okay. I wasn&#x27;t very clear there. By, \"this is basically what I suggested we do a few years ago\" I meant that we should look to exploit the limitations of these fingering printing algorithms to render them impractical. But yeah, my suggestion was that we should do the reverse. Rather than taint the database, taint the content.2. That wasn&#x27;t my intention. I was suggesting that there are likely other reasons governments are interested in this technology than, \"think of the children\". Hence, why I think we should seek to ways to render these algorithms ineffective were they deployed. But yes, please feel free to downvote if you feel my comment is unproductive. On reflection I agree it might be. I&#x27;m not really adding much here3. You know what&#x27;s annoying? I did that because I didn&#x27;t to make an assertion either way to be as neutral as possible. I&#x27;m using quotes because others deem it racist, and that it&#x27;s irrelevant what my personal position on that is. If you want my position on whether racism exists though, obviously I believe it does – I&#x27;d urge you to just assume good faith in the future. reply astrange 12 hours agoparentprev> Seems all need to here is obtain a finger print of a CSAM image then you can reverse engineer a non CSAM image to match that finger print.

    "originBody": "Introducing Lit-GPT: Hackable implementation of open-source large language models released under Apache 2.0 → ← BACK TO BLOG Finetuning LLMs with LoRA and QLoRA: Insights from Hundreds of Experiments Posted on October 12, 2023 by Sebastian Raschka - Blog, Community, Tutorials Takeaways LoRA is one of the most widely used, parameter-efficient finetuning techniques for training custom LLMs. From saving memory with QLoRA to selecting the optimal LoRA settings, this article provides practical insights for those interested in applying it. Introduction: Getting the Most out of LoRA I’ve run hundreds, if not thousands, of experiments involving LoRA over the past few months. A few weeks ago, I took the time to delve deeper into some of the hyperparameter choices. This is more of an experimental diary presented in sequential order. I hope it proves useful to some. Specifically, I aim to address questions about the value of QLoRA, whether to replace AdamW with SGD, the potential use of a scheduler, and how to adjust the LoRA hyperparameters. There’s a lot to discuss on the experimental side, so I’ll keep the introduction to LoRA brief. In short, LoRA, short for Low-Rank Adaptation (Hu et al 2021), adds a small number of trainable parameters to the model while the original model parameters remain frozen. LoRA decomposes a weight matrix into two smaller weight matrices, as illustrated below, to approximate full supervised finetuning in a more parameter-efficient manner. For more details about LoRA, please see my in-depth article Parameter-Efficient LLM Finetuning With Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The topics we are going to cover in this article as organized as follows: 1. Evaluation Tasks and Dataset 2. Code Framework 3. Choosing a Good Base Model 4. Evaluating the LoRA Defaults 5. Memory Savings with QLoRA 6. Learning Rate Schedulers and SGD 7. Iterating Over the Dataset Multiple Times 8. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 1: LoRA for All Layers 9. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 2: Increasing R 10. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 3: Changing Alpha 11. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 3: Very Large R 12. Leaderboard Submission 13. Conclusion Evaluation Tasks and Dataset The focus of this article is on selecting the optimal settings. To stay within a reasonable scope, I’m keeping the dataset fixed and focusing solely on supervised instruction-finetuning of LLMs. (Modifications to the dataset or finetuning for classification might be addressed in future articles.) For the model evaluation, I selected a small subset of tasks from Eleuther AI’s Evaluation Harness, including TruthfulQA, BLiMP Causative, MMLU Global Facts, and simple arithmetic tasks with two (arithmetic 2ds) and four digits (arithmetic 4ds). In each benchmark, the model performance score is normalized between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect score. TruthfulQA reports two scores, which are defined as follows: MC1 (Single-true): Given a question and 4-5 answer choices, select the only correct answer. The model’s selection is the answer choice to which it assigns the highest log-probability of completion following the question, independent of the other answer choices. The score is the simple accuracy across all questions. MC2 (Multi-true): Given a question and multiple true / false reference answers, the score is the normalized total probability assigned to the set of true answers. For reference, the 175B GPT-3 model has TruthfulQA MC1 and MC2 values of 0.21 and 0.33, respectively. Below are two examples to illustrate the difference between arithmetic 2ds and arithmetic 4ds: Arithmetic 2ds: “What is 59 minus 38”. “21”. Arithmetic 4ds: “What is 2762 plus 2751”. “5513”. As mentioned above, I kept the dataset fixed, using the well-studied or rather commonly used Alpaca dataset for supervised instruction finetuning. Of course, many other datasets are available for instruction finetuning, including LIMA, Dolly, LongForm, FLAN, and more. However, exploring training on multiple datasets and dataset mixes will be an interesting topic for future studies. The Alpaca dataset consists of approximately 50k instruction-response pairs for training with a median length of 110 tokens for the input size (using the Llama 2 SentencePiece tokenizer), as shown in the histogram below. The dataset tasks themselves can be structured as shown in the figure below. Code Framework The custom LLM finetuning code I used for this article is based on the open-source Lit-GPT repository. To keep the preamble of this article brief, I won’t go into the usage details, but you can find a more detailed guide in the Lit-GPT tutorials section here. In brief, the usage is as follows: 1) Clone the repository and install the requirements git clone https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt cd lit-gpt pip install -r requirements.txt 2) Download and prepare a model checkpoint python scripts/download.py \\ --repo_id mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 # there are many other supported models python scripts/convert_hf_checkpoint.py \\ --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 3) Prepare a dataset python scripts/prepare_alpaca.py \\ --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 # or from a custom CSV file python scripts/prepare_csv.py \\ --csv_dir MyDataset.csv \\ --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 4) Finetune python finetune/lora.py \\ --checkpoint_dir checkpoints/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/ \\ --precision bf16-true 5) Merge LoRA weights python scripts/merge_lora.py \\ --checkpoint_dir \"checkpoints/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1\" \\ --lora_path \"out/lora/alpaca/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/lit_model_lora_finetuned.pth\" \\ --out_dir \"out/lora_merged/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/\" cp checkpoints/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/*.json \\ out/lora_merged/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/ 6) Evaluate python eval/lm_eval_harness.py \\ --checkpoint_dir \"out/lora_merged/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/\" \\ --eval_tasks \"[arithmetic_2ds, ..., truthfulqa_mc]\" \\ --precision \"bf16-true\" \\ --batch_size 4 \\ --num_fewshot 0 \\ --save_filepath \"results.json\" 7) Use python chat/base.py \\ --checkpoint_dir \"out/lora_merged/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1/\" Choosing a Good Base Model The first task was to select a competent base model for the LoRA experiments. For this, I focused on models that were not already instruction-finetuned: phi-1.5 1.3B, Mistral 7B, Llama 2 7B, Llama 2 13B, and Falcon 40B. Note that all experiments were run on a single A100 GPU. As we can see from the table above, the Mistral 7B model performs extraordinarily well on the math benchmarks. Meanwhile, the phi-1.5 1.3B model showcases impressive TruthfulQA MC2 performance given its relatively small size. For some reason, Llama 2 13B struggles with the arithmetic benchmarks, whereas the smaller Llama 2 7B outperforms it significantly in that area. Since researchers and practitioners are currently speculating that phi-1.5 1.3B and Mistral 7B might have been trained on benchmark test data, I chose not to use them in my experiments. Moreover, I believed that selecting the smallest of the remaining models would provide the most room for improvement while maintaining lower hardware requirements. Therefore, the remainder of this article will focus on Llama 2 7B. Evaluating the LoRA Defaults First, I evaluated LoRA finetuning with the following default settings (these can be changed in the finetune/lora.py script): # Hyperparameters learning_rate = 3e-4 batch_size = 128 micro_batch_size = 1 max_iters = 50000 # train dataset size weight_decay = 0.01 lora_r = 8 lora_alpha = 16 lora_dropout = 0.05 lora_query = True lora_key = False lora_value = True lora_projection = False lora_mlp = False lora_head = False warmup_steps = 100 (Note that the batch size is 128, but we are using gradient accumulation with a microbatch size of 1 to save memory; it results in the equivalent training trajectory as regular training with batch size 128. If you are curious about how gradient accumulation works, please see my article Finetuning LLMs on a Single GPU Using Gradient Accumulation). This configuration trained 4,194,304 LoRA parameters out of a total of 6,738,415,616 trainable parameters and took approximately 1.8 hours on my machine using a single A100. The maximum memory usage was 21.33 GB. To gauge the variance, I repeated the experiment three times to observe the fluctuation in performance between runs. As we can see in the table above, the performance between runs is very consistent and stable. It’s also worth noting that the LoRA default model became really bad at arithmetic, but this is probably to be expected as Alpaca does not contain (m)any arithmetic tasks to the best of my knowledge. In addition, I also looked at the 7B Llama 2 version that has been instruction-finetuned by Meta using RLHF. As we can see based on the table below, the arithmetic performance is also worse for Meta’s Llama 2 Chat model as well. However, the Chat model is much improved on the other benchmarks (except BLiMP), which we can use as a reference that we want to approach with LoRA finetuning. Memory Savings with QLoRA Before we start tuning the LoRA hyperparameters, I wanted to explore the trade-off between modeling performance and memory savings provided by QLoRA (the popular quantized LoRA technique by Dettmers et al). We can enable QLoRA via the –quantize flag (here with 4-bit Normal Float type) in Lit-GPT as follows: In addition, I also tried 4-bit floating point precision as a control. Below is the impact on the training time and maximum memory usage: Default LoRA (with bfloat-16): Training time: 6685.75s Memory used: 21.33 GB QLoRA via –-quantize “bnb.nf4”: Training time: 10059.53s Memory used: 14.18 GB QLoRA via –quantize “bnb.fp4”: Training time: 9334.45s Memory used: 14.19 GB We can see that QLoRA decreases the memory requirements by almost 6 GB. However, the tradeoff is a 30% slower training time, which is to be expected due to the additional quantization and dequantization steps. Next, let’s take a look at how QLoRA training affects the model performance: As we can see in the table above, QLoRA does have a small impact on the model performance compared to regular QLoRA. The model improves on the arithmetic benchmarks but declines on the MMLU Global Facts benchmark. Since the memory savings are quite substantial (which usually outweighs the longer training time since it allows users to run the models on smaller GPUs), I will use QLoRA for the remainder of the article. Learning Rate Schedulers and SGD I used the AdamW optimizer for all the previous experiments since it’s a common choice for LLM training. However, it’s well known that the Adam optimizer can be quite memory-intensive. This is because it introduces and tracks two additional parameters (the moments m and v) for each model parameter. Large language models (LLMs) have many model parameters; for instance, our Llama 2 model has 7 billion model parameters. This section explores whether it’s worthwhile swapping AdamW with an SGD optimizer. However, for SGD optimizers it’s especially important to also introduce a learning rate scheduler. I opted for a cosine annealing schedule that lowers the learning rate after each batch update. If you are interested in more details on using learning rate schedulers in PyTorch, I have a lecture on it here. Unfortunately, swapping AdamW with SGD resulted in only minor memory savings. AdamW: 14.18 GB SGD: 14.15 GB This is likely due to the fact that the most memory is spend on large matrix multiplications rather than keeping additional parameters in memory. Even though SGD does not provide us with notable memory savings, let’s still have a quick look at the resulting model performance: It seems that the performance of the SGD optimizer is comparable to that of AdamW. Interestingly, when a scheduler is added to AdamW, there’s an improvement in the TruthfulQA MC2 and MMLU Global Facts performances, but a decrease in arithmetic performance. (Note: TruthfulQA MC2 is a widely recognized benchmark featured in other public leaderboards.) For the time being, we won’t place too much emphasis on the arithmetic performance and will proceed with the remaining experiments in this article using AdamW with a scheduler. If you want to reproduce these experiments, I found that the best AdamW learning rate was 3e-4 with a decay rate of 0.01. The best SGD learning rate was 0.1, with a momentum of 0.9. I used an additional 100 steps of learning rate warmup in both cases. (Based on these experiments, the cosine scheduler has been added to Lit-GPT and is now enabled by default.) Iterating Over the Dataset Multiple Times So far, I have trained all models with 50k iterations — the Alpaca dataset has 50k training examples. The obvious question is whether we can improve the model performance by iterating over the training set multiple times, so I ran the previous experiment with 100k iterations, which is a 2-fold increase: Interestingly, the increased iterations result in worse performance across the board. The decline is most significant for the arithmetic benchmarks. My hypothesis is that the Alpaca dataset does not contain any related arithmetic tasks, and the model actively unlearns basic arithmetic when it focuses more on other tasks. Anyway, I would be lying if I said this outcome wasn’t welcome. This way, I can continue with the shorter 50k iteration experiments for the remainder of this article. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 1: LoRA for All Layers Now that we have explored the basic settings surrounding the LoRA finetuning scripts, let’s turn our attention to the LoRA hyperparameters themselves. By default, LoRA was only enabled for the Key and Query matrices in the multi-head self-attention blocks. Now, we are also enabling it for the Value matrix, the projection layers, and the linear layers: LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 2: Increasing R One of the most important LoRA parameters is “r”, which determines the rank or dimension of the LoRA matrices, directly influencing the complexity and capacity of the model. A higher “r” means more expressive power but can lead to overfitting, while a lower “r” can reduce overfitting at the expense of expressiveness. Keeping LoRA enabled for all layers, let’s increase the r from 8 to 16 and see what impact this has on the performance: We can see that just increasing r by itself made the results worse, so what happened? Let’s find out in the next section. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 3: Changing Alpha In the previous section, we increase the matrix rank r while leaving LoRA’s alpha parameter unchanged. A higher “alpha” would place more emphasis on the low-rank structure or regularization, while a lower “alpha” would reduce its influence, making the model rely more on the original parameters. Adjusting “alpha” helps in striking a balance between fitting the data and preventing overfitting by regularizing the model. As a rule of thumb, it’s usually common to choose an alpha that is twice as large as the rank when finetuning LLMs (note that this is different when working with diffusion models). Let’s try this out and see what happens when we increase alpha two-fold: As we can see, increasing alpha to 32 now yields our best model thus far! But again we bought this improvement with a larger number of parameters to be trained: r=8: Number of trainable parameters: 20,277,248 Number of non trainable parameters: 6,738,415,616 Memory used: 16.42 GB r=16: Number of trainable parameters: 40,554,496 Number of non trainable parameters: 6,738,415,616 Memory used: 16.47 GB However, the number of trainable parameters is still small enough that it doesn’t noticeably impact the peak memory requirements. Anyways, we are now finally starting to make some gains and improve the model performance by more noticeable margins. So, let’s keep going and see how far we can push this by increasing the rank and alpha: I also ran additional experiments with exceptionally large ranks (512, 1024, and 2048), but these resulted in poorer outcomes. Some of the runs didn’t even converge to a near-zero loss during training, which is why I didn’t add them to the table. So far, we can note that the r=256 and alpha=512 model in the last row resulting in the best performance overall so far. As an additional control experiments, I repeated the runs with an alpha of 1 and noticed that a large alpha value was indeed necessary for the good performance: I also repeated the experiments with alpha values of 16 and 32, and I observed the same worse performance compared to choosing the alpha value as two-times the rank. LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning Part 3: Very Large R For the final tuning experiment of this article, I wanted to further optimize the alpha value of the best model from the previous section (r=256, last row), suspecting that it might be a bit too large. As seen in the table above, choosing a large alpha value appears to be crucial when increasing the rank. For the QLoRA model with r=256 and a=512, it’s evident that our model has made significant improvements over the base model. The only area where the finetuned model underperforms compared to the base model is in 4-digit arithmetic. However, this is understandable, considering the Alpaca dataset probably did not contain such training examples. Leaderboard Submission We know that in machine learning, we should not use the test set multiple times. Otherwise, we risk over-optimizing to a specific task. Hence, it’s recommended to validate a model on a final independent dataset. Coincidentally, there’s currently the NeurIPS LLM Efficiency challenge under way, which is focused on finetuning an LLM on a single GPU. Since I was curious to see how the Llama-2 7B base model compares to our best LoRA model finetuned on Alpaca, I submitted both the base and the finetune model to their leaderboard. We can see that the (Q)LoRA finetuning, which took 10522.77s (~3h) to train and required 19.24 GB GPU memory with the r=256 setting, improved the performance on several but not all benchmarks. The performance could potentially be improved by considering different finetuning datasets other than Alpaca and considering alignment techniques such as RLHF, which I explained in more detail here. Conclusion This article explored the various knobs we can tune when training custom LLMs using LoRA. We found that QLoRA is a great memory-saver even though it comes at an increased runtime cost. Moreover, while learning rate schedulers can be beneficial, choosing between AdamW and SGD optimizers makes little difference. And iterating over the dataset more than once can make the results even worse. The best bang for the buck can be achieved by optimizing the LoRA settings, including the rank. Increasing the rank will result in more trainable parameters, which could lead to higher degrees of overfitting and runtime costs. However, when increasing the rank, choosing the appropriate alpha value is important. This article was by no means exhaustive and in the sense that I did not have the time and resources to explore all possible configurations. Also, future improvements could be achieved by considering other datasets and models. I hope that you can gain one or the other insight that you can apply to your projects. I kept the background information and explanations on various concepts like LoRA, learning rate schedulers, gradient accumulation, and so on to a minimum so that this article doesn’t not become unreasonably longer.

LoRA (for Low Rank) benefits from the \"small changes\" introduced during finetuning of a model. The update of the weights has a low rank. If you take a smaller model, it might induce that the rank is not so low, resulting in degradation in metrics by LoRA compression.

The goal is to maximize performance while minimizing memory usage and training time.The base model used is Llama-2 7B. Experiments compare default LoRA, QLoRA (4-bit quantized), AdamW, SGD optimizers, and different choices for rank r and alpha hyperparameters.Key findings:QLoRA provides substantial memory savings (6GB less than default LoRA) at the cost of slower training. Performance impact is minor.AdamW vs SGD makes little difference in memory or performance.Increasing training iterations from 50k to 100k hurts performance, likely because the Alpaca dataset lacks diversity.Tuning rank r and alpha is most impactful. Good rule of thumb is to set alpha=2*r. Best model uses r=256, alpha=512. Improves over base model on most tasks, except arithmetic.The optimized LoRA model was submitted to the NeurIPS efficiency challenge and showed improvements on several benchmarks compared to the base Llama-2 model.Takeaways are practical tips for tuning LoRA hyperparameters and trading off memory, compute, and model performance. reply snitty 13 hours agoprevLoRA, not LoRa.I was VERY confused for a minute. reply wkipling 12 hours agoparentI was excited to see long range radio to meet machine learning reply naillo 18 hours agoprevGood article but my god why is there like a 2 second delay before every user interaction on this page.

Since using a receiver that produces sound given a FM&#x2F;SSB demodulation of whatever true modulation is used, or visually inspecting a waterfall certainly has limitations. reply tero 19 hours agoparentMy students Dianne, Pauli, Mikko and Juho tried [1] this. They wrote a blog [2] and a git repository [3]. It&#x27;s not a ready to use product, but an exploration and learning journey to using machine learning for identifying signals.Multiple steps are required to get to readable or audible output: identifying a signal, identifying modulation and demodulating.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terokarvinen.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;ai-sdr-analyze-radio-signals-w...

Using the spectrum or waterfall as the input to an RFML system is very common and in my experience works pretty well. A lot of systems also train on I&#x2F;Q data. Usually these systems are designed to be trained on signals that are relevant to a specific mission. So a product might look like both a platform for annotating and training a model as well as deploying it, usually as a plug-in into a separate expensive SIGINT platform. The biggest products I&#x27;m aware of aren&#x27;t even advertised and last I heard cost in the six figures. reply jjoonathan 20 hours agoparentprevRohde & Schwarz ran a contest on this idea a while ago.

If you want to process large, wideband scans, you could iterate over peaks and check things like: does phase shift create any interesting set of points, does PLL find consistent amplitude keying, does the frequency move around the centre. That covers 99% of what you&#x27;re going to find in the wild. The first part (transform the signal) is definitely not great for ML, but the second part (does the result look like set of points &#x2F; digital on&#x2F;off key &#x2F; voice) could be classified that way.There are some existing projects like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;randaller&#x2F;cnn-rtlsdr (that one tries to identify more specific tv signals though) reply anilakar 20 hours agorootparentAutomatic classifiers tend to look for power above the background noise and then AM demodulate the signal around it. That demodulated signal, or video as it&#x27;s called, is centered around 0 Hz and can be matched against a database of spectrum masks for various modulations, baud rates and other parameters.No neural nets required. Just good old regression. reply vdqtp3 15 hours agorootparentSo how would they fare against something below the noise floor, like FT8 reply trothamel 15 hours agorootparentFT8 isn&#x27;t actually below the noise floor if you look at the bandwith the signal is detected in, rather than the 2500 Hz reference bandwidth.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tapr.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;DCC2018-KC5RUO-TheReal-FT8-JT65-JT9=SNR...Has details, but basically you should add 26 dB to account for the difference between 2500 Hz and the 6.25 Hz bandwidth each FT8 tone is detected in. reply abnry 17 hours agoparentprevThere is a fair amount of published research on this. reply beaugunderson 12 hours agoparentprevcode for a CNN-based approach here:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;randaller&#x2F;cnn-rtlsdr reply madengr 20 hours agoparentprev [–] Yes, there are companies specializing in this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deepsig.ai&#x2F; replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Getting started Documentation Integrations Examples Blog Need help? Removal of Mazda Connected Services integration October 13, 2023 Paulus Schoutsen Public-Service-Announcement Comments On October 11, 2023, we were informed that an open-source contributor received a cease and desist letter from Mazda North American Operations (Mazda) regarding his library to connect with Mazda services. This library was used by the Home Assistant integration Mazda Connected Services, which he also maintained. A DMCA notice was sent to GitHub requesting the removal of all code and forked repositories as well. The contributor has complied with the cease and desist letter. The library is no longer available, and the Mazda Connected Services integration has been removed from Home Assistant in the 2023.10.2 patch release of Home Assistant released on October 12, 2023. Home Assistant is disappointed that Mazda has decided to take this position. We’re also sad that Mazda’s first recourse was not to reach out to us and the maintainer but to send a cease and desist letter instead. We invite Mazda to speak with us about this topic. We would love to have an open and constructive discussion about the potential that a Home Assistant integration has for them and their customers. We genuinely believe there is a common ground between us and Mazda when it comes to enabling the owners of their cars to explore the possibilities of their own data. After all, other car manufacturers do see this potential. For example, Tesla has recently released official API documentation to support third-party apps. Volkswagen Group’s Audi brand has launched an app store in their cars that features the Home Assistant app. We hope Mazda will see this potential, as well.

Mazda should lose this under Google v. Oracle. However, reverse engineering is dangerous. They surely read the copyrighted decompiled code. The test is whether the expressive elements of bdr99&#x27;s implementation are substantially similar. reply Nextgrid 13 hours agorootparent> They surely read the copyrighted decompiled codeDo they? When it comes to reverse-engineering mobile app APIs, the usual strategy is to observe the network because it&#x27;s so much easier than making sense of the disassembled binary.Even if you can decompile, you&#x27;d generally use it as an aid to understand the network captures rather than using it as your primary source. reply hultner 13 hours agorootparentThis is what I would usually do as well, self-MiTM and analyze the traffic, reverse engineer from there. reply aneutron 12 hours agorootparentWhile if possible, it&#x27;s the best course of action, the truth is these days additions like HSTS make it extremely difficult to MITM.Additionally, MITM and trying things out on a toaster are one thing, doing the same on a 40k$ machine that can potentially make it impossible to do your commute is another.This is IMO a prime example where the double team rev eng is key to success: one documents the API, the other uses it without having access to code (whiteroom) reply ameliaquining 3 hours agorootparentNitpick: HSTS doesn&#x27;t interfere with MITM.

Thanks replystavros 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve reverse engineered many an API, and I&#x27;ve never done it by decompiling the executable. Also, what&#x27;s illegal about decompiling an executable? reply Nextgrid 13 hours agorootparentThey could argue that by viewing the copyrighted code&#x2F;implementation, you could effectively infringe by (even subconsciously) writing the same&#x2F;similar code.There&#x27;s merits to this claim if you&#x27;re indeed implementing some advanced, niche algorithm but it definitely wouldn&#x27;t apply here as all he&#x27;s doing is calling HTTP APIs, a very generic and common thing to do. reply stavros 13 hours agorootparentAh, so it&#x27;s not the act of disassembling that&#x27;s the problem, but that you&#x27;re infringing on the original code&#x27;s copyright? That makes sense, thank you. reply angus-prune 13 hours agorootparentYou may have come across this concept already, but this is where clean rooms come in.One person views the \"contaminated\" decompiled code and writes a specification. A separate person writes the code based solely on the specification. This is an accepted method of demonstrating that there is no infringement. reply stavros 12 hours agorootparentYep, I knew of clean-room reimplementations, I was just wondering whether decompiling is somehow in itself illegal. reply 6502nerdface 11 hours agorootparentprevBut disassembling&#x2F;decompiling doesn&#x27;t give you anything like the original code! reply stavros 11 hours agorootparentThat kind of depends on the language, but it&#x27;s a fair point. I think it might only matter that the general algorithm&#x2F;solution is the same, not the lines of text themselves. reply aidenn0 10 hours agorootparentprevIt gives you a derivative work of the original code replysp1rit 13 hours agorootparentprevThis might be the case, but how could Mazda even prove this? Unless they communicate in some weird proprietary binary protocol I could imagine that the API (especially if it&#x27;s just some JSON&#x2F;XML REST stuff) can be reverse engineered by MitM traffic analysis. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 13 hours agorootparentIf it&#x27;s HTTPS stuff, they might be claiming that it falls under DMCA 1201 shenanigans.> (A) No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;uscode&#x2F;text&#x2F;17&#x2F;1201As I understand it, car manufacturers prevent independent repair shops from lawfully obtaining some of the diagnostics information in the onboard computer by encrypting it with a key that sits on the very same drive. Said encryption is the \"technological measure that effectively controls access\" and using the key to decrypt it is \"circumvention\" -- naturally, of the \"effective\" access control.(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;definitions&#x2F;uscode.php?def_id=17... to “circumvent a technological measure” means to descramble a scrambled work, to decrypt an encrypted work, or otherwise to avoid, bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair a technological measure, without the authority of the copyright owner)Mazda might be interpreting the SSL certificate as a similar measure and therefore use of the certificate to decrypt traffic as a similar violation. reply wuuza 13 hours agorootparentFrom the posted notice[1], they answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you claim to have any technological measures in place to control access to your copyrighted content? Please see our Complaints about Anti-Circumvention Technology if you are unsure.\" Is that the same thing you are referencing?[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;dmca&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;2023-10-1... reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 13 hours agorootparentYep, sounds like it, which rules that out.

I wonder if there is a \"McKenzie\" like consulting company for MBAs that would explain to them in terms they could understand why it is both more powerful and market affirming to have an open ecosystem which gives you \"free\" programmers who will add features without you paying them a salary and without having to lay them off once the feature has been implemented. reply maweki 14 hours agoparentIf you want people to use the official app (if there is&#x2F;were one, I don&#x27;t know), and use the app to upsell and market, or collect and sell additional user data, you&#x27;re not interested in an open ecosystem.Just remember: they don&#x27;t just want money. They want all the money. reply Nextgrid 13 hours agorootparentMore importantly, their employees want money and will use whatever means necessary to justify their paycheck.A Home Assistant integration means people \"engage\" less with their app and thus whoever is working on it is at risk of irrelevance. Doesn&#x27;t matter whether this actually translates to more business and money coming in at the top, PM wants their \"engagement\" and this is an easy way to trade long-term customer goodwill for it. reply somehnguy 12 hours agorootparentOn the other side of that coin though - Home Asssistant isn&#x27;t exactly a mainstream app, it&#x27;s almost exclusively run by tech geeks. The same type of people who are usually willing to mentally cross off brands when they make moves like this.It&#x27;s a wash. reply bombcar 10 hours agorootparentIf you’re smart you make it so that the API needs a “key” from the app in some way, so that the API being used “registers” as an app usage. reply schoen 9 hours agoparentprevEric von Hippel at MIT has written a bunch of business-oriented research along these lines (related to \"user innovation\").https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eric_von_Hippel reply lapetitejort 14 hours agoparentprevBut Twitter and Reddit doesn&#x27;t need them, so why would I? Sarcasm, of course. Third party devs are just as responsible for the aforementioned website&#x27;s success as the first party devs reply crmd 14 hours agoprevI hope the EFF or a similar non-profit steps in here. Bad faith DMCA notices such as this need to be challenged as a matter of principle. reply jsight 14 hours agoparentThe DMCA notice is unclear here. It is odd that it calls out all implementations including both their copyrighted ios and android apps, as well as the client implementations in Javascript and Python.Presumably neither their ios nor Android app used Python, so direct copyright infringement seems impossible.It certainly seems likely that this DMCA notice was in bad faith. reply KennyBlanken 13 hours agoparentprevThe EFF doesn&#x27;t give a damn about helping fight specific DMCA abuses unless you&#x27;re one of the technorati; they&#x27;re focused on the \"big picture.\"At best you might get an amicus brief if there&#x27;s a lawsuit and the lawsuit is high-profile enough for them to be interested. reply css 14 hours agoprevIf anyone wants to see what the integration used to do: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20230728021205&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.home-... reply jabroni_salad 14 hours agoparentIt looks like the library could remotely start the car. I wonder if they&#x27;d care if it couldn&#x27;t.I think that&#x27;s actually not something that would be wise to hook up to an automation platform. A car running in the garage can kill, and &#x27;a human chose to press this button&#x27; is an important interlock. After all, you have to swipe your way in to the official app, and to use a key fob you need to hold the button for several seconds.&#x27;How dare Mazda permit this&#x27; is a real lawsuit that will happen. Automakers also got sued because pushbutton start is confusing and people would leave the car running after use. There is an active lawsuit right now about push-button gear selectors making it too hard to put the vehicle in park, allowing unexpected rollaways. reply gonzaloalvarez 13 hours agorootparentI have my car (Subaru) hooked to an automation with home assistant. Several, actually. I can start the car in winter by pushing a button in my kitchen, heat it up, and then walk there. But the most important one is that I can turn the car off remotely as well, based on timers and automations. I generally don’t buy the ‘we should not allow this or that because it can be dangerous’. I’m a big boy. Driving is even more dangerous always. Let me choose. Please. reply jabroni_salad 13 hours agorootparentHere&#x27;s a really fun one from yesterday&#x27;s &#x27;midwit&#x27; thread:> I have somehow automated some lights to come on too early in the morning but the specific task&#x2F;automation I set to do this is nowhere to be found.. I can create and remove new tasks but I&#x27;m being haunted by this old task.Do you have an attached garage? How about if it gets turned on with the door closed at 4am after a daylight savings changeover gone horribly wrong. I enjoy my home assistant but I wouldn&#x27;t let it control something that can gas me. I&#x27;ve seen way too much weird shit in my iot network to ever trust it with that.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37859813 reply londons_explore 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ll be pleased to know that pretty much no post 2005 car can gas you.Old cars gassed people with carbon monoxide. Odorless and deadly.Modern cars make basically none of that. Instead, you&#x27;ll die of too much CO2.Luckily, humans are pretty good at detecting gradually increasing levels of CO2 - it&#x27;s what happens when 5 people are in a car together and someone says \"it&#x27;s getting stuffy in here, turn the vent on!\".Sudden CO2 increases can still kill. But gradual ones like a car gradually producing more and more CO2 likely wouldn&#x27;t. Even in your sleep, you will wake up and find the air stuffy (it can happen when lots of cave people are all sleeping in a badly ventilated cave, so we evolved to handle it).However, you shouldn&#x27;t rely on the above for the safety of people - all it takes is someone to be drunk or taking sleeping pills, and they might not be able to act on their senses... Also, cars where the emissions system has been tampered with or faulty can still produce a lot of deadly carbon monoxide. reply jabroni_salad 12 hours agorootparentMan, I live in snow country and every year someone gets killed idling in the winter. Kids idling and hanging out or someone parked eating their lunch. It&#x27;s true that CO emissions are way down since the mid-aughts rules went in, but it isn&#x27;t 0 ppm.The last go-around about the keyless ignitions was kicked off by a 2017 toyota.

I&#x27;ve had nothing but good experiences with the several Mazda vehicles I&#x27;ve owned (still daily-drive the rotary-engine RX8...). Seeing them engage in what appears to be dmca bullying of a project like Home Assistant feels like a betrayal. reply Grazester 10 hours agoparentA daily driver RX-8 that stills drives? How? What&#x27;s your mileage and oil consumption like. As quirky as the RX-8 was, I liked the car but not the engine. reply jmrm 1 hour agorootparentNot OP, but I know people who mix two-stroke oil with the gas to have better reliability, but AFAIK you need to change apex seals sooner or later.For me it&#x27;s sad how such an interesting engine had so many problems. reply tpmx 14 hours agoprevMazda is (otherwise) a great and relatively speaking small car company.

For the second, not so much.Anyway, the moral of the story is that the DMCA was written to GitHub. Your own local clone is no one’s business. reply HorizonXP 12 hours agoprevDammit. I just bought a Mazda and I have Connected Services. The app sucks. Also I was about to spend this weekend trying to figure out how to get it hooked into HomeKit so I could turn on climate controls while getting kids ready in the morning. I’ve used Home Assistant in the past, sad to see it removed.I guess I’ll just reverse engineer it myself. Good to know it is possible since I can replace the app. reply bastard_op 13 hours agoprevThat is truly frustrating as a customer. You know that person that built the code is putting that Mazda up for sale right now if not setting it on fire as I&#x27;d likely do.These fools really don&#x27;t like someone building a better mousetrap, particularly when they see it as an exploit of their systems to do so, as they can&#x27;t track&#x2F;monetize&#x2F;charge, etc the usage without the app component. That&#x27;s really what Mazda is angry about.As a result of things like these, I&#x27;ll end up keeping my old non-connected cars as long as possible, environment be damned. reply callalex 12 hours agoparentKeeping an old car that has already been produced running is almost always the most environmentally friendly choice instead of throwing it away and producing a new car. The only reason to upgrade should be the changes in safety technology. reply bombcar 10 hours agorootparentCars are rarely thrown away if they’re still operational (which was one of the huge problems with cash for clunkers, those were crushed).The best reason to buy new is that your mission has changed and the available used vehicles don’t provide a cost effective resource. reply toomuchtodo 12 hours agoparentprevThey should buy a Tesla, as they support their API as a first class citizen in the ecosystem.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tesla.com&#x2F;developer-docshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;electrek.co&#x2F;2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;12&#x2F;tesla-releases-official-api-d... reply physhster 13 hours agoprevI don&#x27;t have a Mazda, nor do I use HA but I&#x27;d happily contribute to a legal defense fund. reply CoastalCoder 14 hours agoprevIn the U.S. legal system, is it possible to create a corporation specifically to do something of uncertain legality, so as to limit the liability?E.g., could we create a FuckYouMazda corporation, whose sole purpose was to develop this software. And if Mazda successfully sued for copyright damages, the financial liability is limited to the corporation&#x27;s assets? reply mminer237 14 hours agoparentExactly how liable the shareholders are is going to vary a lot by state. Generally a plaintiff has to show the shareholders exercised excessive control over the corporation such that the corporation is essentially a sham.However, a person is generally liable for his own torts regardless of corporation. The shareholders might not be liable vis-à-vis the corporation, but the actual programmers and managers doing the infringement could likely be sued individually the same as if they weren&#x27;t working for a corporation. reply malfist 14 hours agoparentprevCorporate protections don&#x27;t work like that, or every petty criminal would be a corporation.Knowing, deliberate actions of criminality are sufficient to piece the corporate veil. reply CoastalCoder 14 hours agorootparentSorry I wasn&#x27;t clear: I was specifically asking about limiting the liability of possible civil violations of the DMCA.I.e., the alleged violations are civil rather than criminal, and a reasonable person might believe Mazda&#x27;s DMCA claims are unjustifiable. reply malfist 13 hours agorootparentI think naming your company `FuckYouMazda` and violating their copyright gives a judge plenty of incentive to pierce the corporate veil. reply CoastalCoder 13 hours agorootparentYou might be missing my point: the corporation would be premised on its founders&#x27; sincere belief that Mazda&#x27;s DMCA claims were, at best, dubious. reply kelnos 12 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that premise really matters.You could sincerely believe that murder was ok, but that&#x27;s not going to change how the law would view you murdering someone.The idea around \"piercing the corporate veil\" is that you can&#x27;t just slap a company in front of your actions -- regardless of whether or not you believe your actions are justified or legal -- and avoid legal consequences. replykevinsundar 11 hours agoprevJust in case anyone else would like to send a quick note to Mazda:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;webpage.mazdausa.com&#x2F;MazdaStatic&#x2F;contactus.action reply Jayakumark 12 hours agoprevWould be good to have EFF involved as they are good with these kind of nonsense takedowns. reply atesti 4 hours agoprevCan I still download the code somewhere, is there a mirror? reply danepowell 9 hours agoprevMazda isn&#x27;t the first car company to abuse DMCA takedowns: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;toyotha&#x2F;toyota-na reply Tao3300 10 hours agoprev [–] Angra Mainyu replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The sponsored segments are not even really the biggest advantage, it also skips intros and outros and interaction reminders, which are huge.I am convinced that being really aggressive about blocking advertisements helps with my ADHD and helps me focus better. I don&#x27;t have science to back that up, just my anecdotal self-reported experience -- but I see improvements every time I get a little bit more purposeful about blocking ads (and not just ads but intros, boot screens, social reminders, suggested articles, etc -- basically interruptions). And when I see ads now that I&#x27;m no longer desensitized to them, they stick out so much and they&#x27;re so hard to ignore. Our brains are good at filtering things out, but I do wonder if there&#x27;s a focus cost in addition to a time cost. My mood improves when my house is clean and organized; my mood also improves when my media consumption is organized and de-cluttered. reply ornornor 4 hours agoparent> interaction remindersI’ve been wondering about these… do people really need to be reminded to “subscribe like comment down below” in every single video?Don’t people know the creator wants you to do it and only do it if they feel like anyway?What’s the point of everyone saying it in every single video?It’s just aggravating to me, but I wonder why they keep saying it? reply Already__Taken 3 hours agorootparentyeh they do.

I still never remember to \"like\" videos because i didn&#x27; grow up on social media. reply geek_at 2 hours agoparentprevI use sponsor block on youtube too (I have youtube premium but that does not remove these sponsor blocks automatically) and the only videos I&#x27;m kinda sad not to see the sponsor blocks are videos by \"Internet Historian\".He does it funny enough not to be annoying. Worst example on the other hand is Linus Tech Tips in my opinion reply dmunozv04 2 hours agorootparentMost SponsorBlock clients offer a way to whitelist certain channels so they aren’t skipped (iSponsorBlockTV does it), so that’s a good option if you like their sponsor segments reply nextlevelwizard 3 hours agoparentprevLong intros are the worst.

Only ads that have the ‘skip’ button will be skipped reply consp 3 hours agorootparentWhich is pretty much none these days. reply dmunozv04 1 hour agorootparentI’ve found that having ads muting is much less obstructive.

Along with adblocking I rarely see the FOPRA (flash of pre-roll ads). Whenever I use a native app (FireTV, Apple TV) I’m annoyed by the now ≥10s unskippable ads. reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparentprevi can almost nod my head in acceptance for a :30 ad before a new piece of content. at :45, i&#x27;m starting to get annoyed. at :60, i&#x27;m wondering if this is really worth it. then, youtube steps up to the plate, points to the fences, and serves up a 2minute30second (i&#x27;ve seen longer) short film on some clearly fake as fuck scam type of 4am paid programming type of crap. on top of serving some mind bendingly annoying long ad break, they don&#x27;t even attempt to prevent serving clearly malicious ads. if you&#x27;re going to be heartless and force ads, don&#x27;t be soulless and at least vet the ads from obvious scams. reply squeaky-clean 2 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a channel I like to watch \"Mini Air Crash Investigation\" who does 5-15 minute long summaries of airplane crashes and the results of the ensuing investigations.I once got an ad on one of their videos for a 45 minute long video of an air crash investigation from a copycat channel narrated by someone with a very similar voice. I got about 10 minutes in before thinking \"wow, this is a pretty weak episode from this channel\" before noticing what was going on.(I don&#x27;t mean to imply all air crash investigation style channels are copying this one. But that video was a straight copy of their style, narrative order, and even voice and speaking style).Like Already__Taken says, if you go a while without skipping ads, youtube seems to intentionally show you longer and longer ads.I have premium now, and while I enjoy it, I really feel like I got bullied into subscribing. If all the ads breaks were 60 seconds total or less I would have been fine staying a free user. But they punish me for not diligently having my finger ready to press \"skip\". reply Already__Taken 3 hours agorootparentprevI left a playlist on while working, so an anonymous account.

Blinkist, $2000 for one video. VPN, specific brand not named, $5800 for a 90 second ad read. Raid Shadow Legends, $2000-6000 depending on if he&#x27;s willing to dedicate time in his video to just playing the game on camera. Skillshare $2000 for a 90 second ad read.The most interesting part to me was these are often not directly offered by these companies. They are from advertising partners who have a referral program with the primary company. So he would often get multiple emails to advertise the same product from different senders and offering different amounts of money. reply hutattedonmyarm 3 hours agorootparentprevNot many creator&#x27;s are on there, but this is the whole idea of Nebula: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nebula.tv reply jamesdwilson 4 hours agorootparentprevMaybe you are. but decades of research indicate that people will choose familiarity and annoyance over ignorance of a product. replyhedora 11 hours agoparentprevOvercast (iOS) supposedly can block ads and skip intros&#x2F;outros.

I’m an Overcast user, and haven’t heard of this - and can’t find the feature now that I look.It does have configurable “skip forward” and “skip backward” _times_, and will skip to and resume from between words instead of inside words - so it’s easier to manually skip than in some other apps - but I don’t think there’s anything automatic.[Edit: Oh! It can skip a configurable amount of time from the start and end of playback of any podcast! It’s still manual though.] reply istjohn 9 hours agorootparentI used Audacity to excerpt a clip from a podcast the other day and the ads were obvious just from the shape of the waveform. The ad section waveforms were half the height of the rest of the podcast. I don&#x27;t know how representative that one podcast is. reply jrmg 10 hours agoprevFor some reason I feel a lot worse about the idea of automatically skipping sponsor sections of YouTube videos than I do about blocking web ads. reply munk-a 10 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t - the creator already got paid... and if it devalues ads to the point of sponsors no longer trying to inject marketing into videos and creators relying on patreon&#x2F;similar I think we&#x27;d be in a better world. reply chii 1 hour agorootparent> creators relying on patreon&#x2F;similar I think we&#x27;d be in a better world.so do you sign on to any patreons for any of the creators you watched? reply danShumway 10 hours agoparentprevNote that you can configure Sponsorblock not to skip sponsored segments but to still skip intros&#x2F;outros and subscription&#x2F;interaction reminders.Adblocking is definitely the thing it&#x27;s advertised on, but sponsored segments are only one labeled category. For longer lets-plays it&#x27;s great to have the equivalent of Netflix&#x27;s \"skip the intro&#x2F;credits\" option. It is an adblocking extension first and foremost, but I still kind of recommend checking it out even if you don&#x27;t plan to block ads with it because you might still find the other categories useful. reply antmldr 9 hours agoparentprevYeah, sponsor sections of content is usually done respectfully of the audience. There&#x27;s no javascript being run on my machine, the sponsor is usually tangentially related to the content, and the creator has an incentive to deliver it in either a humorous or relevant manner. reply dylan604 4 hours agorootparent>Yeah, sponsor sections of content is usually done respectfully of the audience.I literally just LOL&#x27;d and spit water at my screen reading that. They are the most condescending over the top waaaaay too long of a segment. Even in the 1950&#x27;s, sponsors were just mentioned along the lines of \"This segment is brought to you by Ovaltine. Remember to drink your Ovaltine!\" and then moves right the fuck along. But nooooo, youtube sponsors took the SNL idea of play it until it&#x27;s uncomfortably long, then keep going until it&#x27;s just funny that they haven&#x27;t stopped, but then continue until you just feel like a sad sap for continuing to have this product&#x2F;service talked about like it is the second coming. Respectful. As. If. reply maronato 4 hours agorootparentMaybe you should watch other creators then. IME better creators have higher respect for their audiences and create better, even entertaining sponsor segments.I have even been introduced to services I pay for now via these segments. Nebula, Backblaze, DBrand, and Audible are some of them. reply sureglymop 3 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t. If the video is streamed to my machine I get to filter it before I consume it. Youtubers make money from merch sales, donations, subscriptions, live events and more. If I want to support someone I find out how to donate to them but I don&#x27;t feel bad about filtering out ad reads. reply AlexandrB 5 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s only so many times I need to hear about Ridge wallet, Surfshark, Manscaped, and Raid: Shadow Legends. reply callalex 8 hours agoparentprevYea, they aren’t stalking you everywhere you go, and they don’t install malware on your device. reply kcb 9 hours agoparentprevI already pay for Youtube Premium which pays the creator in return for ad-free viewing.

I&#x27;m delighted to see new offerings in this space. Kudos to the team! I spent some time tinkering with the deployed preview (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.scalar.com). I liked the thoughtful implementation around customizations &#x2F; versioning, etc.Some places I hit friction while exploring: - It was tough to close the \"Test request\" window. - I wasn&#x27;t sure how to interact with the product without more trial and error.Two suggestions I thought might be useful: 1. Add OpenAPI linting to the editor. Right now it works with invalid specs as long as long the JSON is formatted correctly. 2. Allow users to import an example spec from the initial Getting Started page. (The editor is a good home for it, too, but I would have found it sooner).Disclosure: I&#x27;m a Redocly employee, but have managed doc projects in a variety of tools. This is a neat approach! Great work and congrats. reply marclave 15 hours agoparentAppreciate the kind words, and the suggestions!> It was tough to close the \"Test request\" window. - I wasn&#x27;t sure how to interact with the product without more trial and error.Ah, this is great feedback. We can make it more clear with a button, as well that you can hit escape.> Add OpenAPI linting to the editor. ah, great idea. will triage this and get this in.> Allow users to import an example spec from the initial Getting Started page. In the getting started page we have \"import url, paste swagger\" & \"petstore + tableau + cmc\" examples to import by clicking.Did you mean to add it to the editor?Ah that&#x27;s very cool, back in the day I always would install redocly instead of swagger UI, great work with Redocly :)Again I really appreciate the kind words and your time. reply melolife 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;m interested in new offerings in this area, as all of the existing options are pretty janky. A couple of thoughts:Operation.summary is typically derived from the documentation for an API operation, and should not be used as the operation title as it is far too long. Instead use the operationId and path.I can&#x27;t get it to render schemas for a bunch of my OpenAPI documents, and there are no error messages to guide me. Does this handle recursive schemas (which can never be fully expanded)? reply cameronrohani 17 hours agoparentThis is great feedback that we&#x27;d love to take a closer look at.If you have a chance please reach out to marc@scalar.com and we can start working on some improvements. reply melolife 16 hours agorootparentAfter some more experimentation it looks like you don&#x27;t support allOf&#x2F;anyOf&#x2F;oneOf which seems like a pretty big hole. reply marclave 14 hours agorootparentour swagger parser isnt perfect yet, appreciate this comment and I added it to triage.

Widdershins turns the OpenAPI specs into markdown, then Slate into HTML. The results look really nice, and the use of templates means it&#x27;s easy to customise.

I use it to generate clients and servers so that my customers can easily upgrade versions or generate them themselves. Are there any plans to formulate examples from those generated clients? That, today, has to be hand annotated if you want the custom examples (beyond REST) to appear in the API documentation. reply marclave 14 hours agorootparentco-founder here :) Appreciate the kind words!Our plans are to make it easier to integrate with existing SDK generation tools so you can use them inside of our API docs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.speakeasyapi.dev&#x2F; is a really great platform and I think we can integrate with them and have examples from custom SDKs.In the scenario with custom domains, we would have to rely on docstrings or comments depending on the language, I&#x27;ll need more thought on that reply Jka9rhnDJos 14 hours agoprevI’m having a lot trouble navigating it on Safari for iOS on iPad.- The top bar disappears behind the navigation bar of Safari and there doesn’t seem to be a way to get it to reappear. - I tried to refresh the page to see if it would re-render and put the bar below the navigation bar, but I can’t pull down to refresh. Something is floating a window inside the window and I’m just pulling that around. - Tried clicking refresh in the nav bar and it didn’t fix the hidden top bar. - It’d be nice to be able to collapse the swagger editor in the reference view.

The products take shape around opinionated solutions that are fundamentally different. So, while they \"do the same thing\", some have better tools for API authoring, some are more usable for non-technical stakeholders, some emphasize performance, some emphasize extensibility, etc. A good analogy is cars. They all drive, but some have 4WD, some have truck beds. reply ushakov 16 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s also postman.com, readme.com, buildwithfern.com, speakeasyapi.dev, useoptic.com, bump.sh along with countless others.

It&#x27;s when your mode of access is obscured, like poking physical hardware, or triggering code through HTTP or other generic protocols, that one needs to actively describe the API to make it \"open\". reply kyawzazaw 10 hours agoprevThe demo seems a little bit off-sync. reply revskill 15 hours agoprevCool to see this.I hate redocly and swagger UI , and all of \"enterprisey\" offering on an open standard like OpenAPI. reply marclave 13 hours agoparentco-founder here! thanks for the kind words.I am also excited for another alternative, that feels modern! reply ushakov 17 hours agoprevWhy did you decide to open-source it?

Its a toy compared to full-blown testing client such as thunder or bruno. Its probably for the best to save the effort and just make documentation itself better and more customizable. reply simonw 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s what I meant by \"interactive features using JavaScript layered over the top\" - you can still have the embedded REST API client behaving exactly the same, but if you load the page without JavaScript (e.g. a search engine crawler) you get the rest of the content as HTML.Great point about feeding the Swagger files straight into the LLM. reply ushakov 16 hours agorootparent> Great point about feeding the Swagger files straight into the LLM.That doesn&#x27;t scale though. Notion OpenAPI doc is more than 6k lines.

    "originBody": "Quantum ProjectsDMOJAbout Guanzhong What I wish I knew when I got my ASN Oct 10, 2023 BGP 21 minutes Quantum qt.ax/asn As you may know, I am currently writing a series on BGP and how the Internet works, from my perspective as the operator of a small autonomous system, AS200351. While we haven’t really exhausted the theoretical material, I think I’ve covered enough to enable readers to set up their own basic autonomous system. Rather than forcing you to do your own research based on outdated and potentially incorrect information on the Internet, or allowing you to fall victim to scams, I think it would be wise to talk about the process of getting your own ASN. For readers who haven’t read the previous parts of the series and are unfamiliar with why one might want an ASN, here’s a brief explanation: An autonomous system (AS) is a constituent part of the Internet that can define its own routing to the remainder of the Internet, and ASes exchange routes with each other over Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to form the Internet itself. By receiving a globally unique identifier, an AS number (ASN), which in my case is 200351, I can exchange routes over BGP with other ASes, announce my own IP addresses to the Internet, and control how traffic flows in and out of my network, as opposed to simply exchanging traffic from a default gateway to reach the Internet with an IP address assigned by my ISP. This comes with several advantages, such as being able to switch upstream ISPs at will (or when such an ISP fails) without changing my IP addresses or breaking a single connection; or to advertise the same IP addresses from multiple locations (anycasting) to allow users to reach my services with lower latency than otherwise permissible by the speed of light with automatic failover. I will now share what I wish I knew when I impulsively decided to apply for an ASN at 3 a.m. on a cold December night last year, now that I’ve been doing this for a while. I’ll walk through the process as objectively and thoroughly as possible, demystifying the role of any player in this space. I would like you to go into this with full knowledge of the risks and a full understanding of where your money is going. In the end, I will offer some subjective suggestions on providers, but those can be ignored if you would rather do your own research. Choosing an RIR As mentioned before in this series, ASNs and IP addresses are Internet numbers, which are resources ultimately managed by the IANA, whose assignment is delegated to the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). There are five RIRs in the world, but since I only have experience with ARIN and RIPE NCC, I will mostly focus on these two. Typically, RIRs allocate ASNs directly to end users, whereas RIRs may allocate IP addresses directly, but also to Local Internet Registries (LIRs) who allocate them to end users. In order for RIRs to issue an ASN, they typically require you to have your own IP addresses that you can announce with BGP, so you probably want to get IP addresses first—either from an RIR directly or from an LIR—or get them with the ASN if that’s an option. Note that it’s possible to use your own IP addresses without your own ASN by getting an ISP to announce them for you, a service typically called “bring your own IP” or BYOIP, but we aren’t doing that here. Given the current state of IPv4 address exhaustion, you will almost certainly be getting IPv6 addresses, likely exclusively. As such, IPv6 will be the main focus. No matter what, you need to choose an RIR for your ASN and IP addresses. Even if you choose to use an LIR for your IP addresses, they ultimately come from an RIR, and the choice of RIR affects how you manage your resources as well as how the resources can be used. The “conventional wisdom” here—espoused by the top search results from hobbynet bloggers—is that ARIN is focused on businesses and RIPE is more hobbynet-friendly, but that’s a rather distorted version of the truth. I’ve done my reading in the past and thought this way once, but I’ve come to realize that things are a lot more complicated than that. At this point, it might be worth noting that each RIR has its own policies on how resources are allocated and how membership is managed, and these policies are mostly motivated by the situation in their service region. RIPE Either way, let’s start with RIPE—or really, RIPE NCC, the Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre. This is the RIR responsible for “Europe and the Middle East”. Due to the relative difficulty of creating companies or getting a trade name for sole proprietors in Europe, RIPE allows “organisations”1 to be created directly with personal names without question.2 For this reason, RIPE is perceived to be a lot more friendly toward hobbyists. RIPE will only serve users who live or have “network presence” in their service region. As far as RIPE is concerned, the latter means having at least a single VPS in the region, which should be announcing at least one route under your ASN, if you choose to get an ASN from them. If you aren’t a resident in the region, you will be asked to produce an invoice for it. As long as you fulfill this requirement, your RIPE resources may be used anywhere in the world. IP resources in RIPE are broadly divided into two categories—Provider Aggregatable (PA) and Provider Independent (PI). PA addresses are large blocks (typically /29 or larger) allocated by RIPE to LIRs, who can in turn hand them to whoever they please—well, subject to RIPE policy. In practice, there aren’t many restrictions, and I’ve seen smaller blocks (especially /44 or smaller) regularly being given away for free. It is important to note that as far as RIPE is concerned, the PA block belongs to the LIR and not to the end users to whom the LIR has assigned subblocks. This means that should the LIR go under, RIPE will take back the entire IP block and end users will lose their allocations without much warning. Therefore, when using PA addresses, it is important to use an LIR that you can trust to continue existing. You should also understand how LIRs operate. To become an LIR, RIPE will charge a one-time fee, currently €1000, along with an annual fee, currently €1550, to be paid in January of every year, which is prorated for new LIRs. RIPE subscribes to the “one LIR, one fee” policy, which means large and small LIRs pay the same. For details, see the RIPE payments page. By policy, each new LIR is entitled to a /24 of IPv4 (due to IPv4 exhaustion, any new LIR will wait a long time before receiving it) and no more. For IPv6, new LIRs are entitled to a /29 without justification. If you choose to get PA addresses from an LIR, keep in mind they probably have at least a /29 (which is 512k /48s) and are paying €1550/year for it. This means that if they manage to fully sell their initial /29, they’ll break even selling each /40 for 76 cents, each /44 for 4.8 cents, or each /48 for 0.3 cents per year. Taking into account the sales and management overhead and the fact the LIR might not sell 99% of their space, an LIR should probably not charge more than $20/year for a PA block of /44 or smaller, or more than $40/year for a /40. PI addresses are small blocks, typically no larger than /48, issued by RIPE directly to end users. Of course, RIPE doesn’t deal with end users directly—instead, users need to get an LIR to sponsor their request and act as the intermediary. For each PI request, RIPE currently charges €50/year. A single request may result in multiple /48s being allocated if the requester has multiple sites and requests a /48 for each, as that’s the minimum routable size on the Internet. It is very rare if not impossible for RIPE to allocate a /44 or larger block of PI addresses, whether contiguously or in aggregate, so any LIR purporting to sell that is unlikely to be able to deliver. Typically, an LIR would charge a bit more than €50/year to handle the request, but they are probably ripping you off if they charge more than double that. Also, note that PI addresses are severely limited in use cases compared to PA. For the exact details, see the RIPE policy on this. Furthermore, if the sponsoring LIR for a PI block goes under, RIPE will ask the end user to find another LIR sponsor within 30 days or take back the resource. ASNs function very similarly to PI resources and require the same sponsorship process, but they currently cost the LIRs nothing to get. This may change one day. There was a proposal this year at the RIPE NCC General Meeting to add a €50/year/ASN fee, but the motion has been defeated, though it may show up again. For this reason, I think LIRs that charge annual fees for ASNs are being unreasonable. In general, I don’t think an ASN should cost more than $100 one-time to issue. Since IP addresses are required for an ASN to be issued, it’s also common for LIRs to sell ASN and IP bundles. In these cases, the one-time fee should cover the ASN and the recurring fee for the IP range. ARIN On the other hand, the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the RIR responsible for the US, Canada, and some Caribbean islands. In this region, it is a lot easier to start a business, so ARIN requires you to be some form of business before they will deal with you. From this, people get the impression that ARIN hates hobbyists. This is not true, since ARIN will accept the simplest business structure—the sole proprietorship. Typically, they would like you to have a trade name, which you can typically request from your local government for a small sum of money. For example, in the province of Ontario, Canada, the government issued me a “Business Name” for “Dynamic Quantum Networks” for $60 CAD, which is valid for 5 years. This is not more expensive than a domain name. Alternatively, ARIN will let you use your personal name if you can prove you have been doing business under that name. For IP addresses, ARIN has two styles of allocations—ISP/LIR and end user. ISP/LIR allocations are quite similar to RIPE’s concept of PA addresses. An ARIN LIR can allocate their IP range to their customers as they please, provided that records are kept to demonstrate that suballocations have been reasonable when requesting more addresses. End user allocations are similar to PI, but ARIN doesn’t have the concept of sponsorships. Instead, ARIN allocates resources directly to the end user. In general, it probably makes more sense to request resources as an ISP/LIR if possible, since the policies are a lot less restrictive. For details, see the Number Resource Policy Manual (NRPM), specifically sections 4.2, 4.3, and 6.5. Note that, unlike RIPE which allows your resources to be used anywhere, ARIN has a more strict out-of-region use policy, requiring /22 of IPv4 to be used in-region before you can use any IPv4 out-of-region. For IPv6, this is a /44 used in-region. For ASNs, the ASN must be present on at least one peering session in-region. For details, see the policy. ARIN has several one-time fees, such as for creating an organization, which is required to receive any allocation. This fee is currently $50. ARIN’s annual fees are based on the amount of resources that you have, currently starting at $250 for up to a /24 of IPv4 and a /403 of IPv6. Currently, ARIN charges $550 to allocate an ASN and $150/year/ASN for ASN-only organizations. If you have any IP addresses, you instead pay the annual fee and all ASNs are free once issued. For details, see the fee schedule. In 2024, this fee schedule is changing to be more reasonable—ASNs will be free to allocate, and the smallest $250 annual fee covers up to 3 ASNs. For details, see the FAQ for this change. The simplified summary of ARIN’s allocation policy is as follows: An LIR can request an initial IPv6 allocation of /32 without justification. An LIR may choose to receive a /36 or a /40 instead to save on fees, but ARIN reserves the full /32 and you can choose to upgrade at any time without justification; An LIR can request an IPv4 allocation of /22 by going on the waitlist, for a total of /20. An LIR may also request special reserved blocks with proper justification; and An LIR can request an ASN with two peering partners. Other RIRs APNIC may be an option if you live in the Asia-Pacific region. I am not familiar with their policies, but I know they give a /23 of IPv4 addresses to each new LIR, which is also the maximum amount of IPv4 APNIC will ever allocate. AfriNIC and LACNIC don’t have all the features you’d expect from APNIC, ARIN, and RIPE. For example, neither has an RPKI publication service for their members, requiring the user to maintain their own. AfriNIC in particular is also involved in many controversies and scandals. Decision I am not qualified to speak about APNIC, AfriNIC, or LACNIC, so I won’t. If you live in their service region, you are welcome to do your own research and compare them with RIPE, which remains a popular option for hobbyists in those regions. This leaves us with ARIN and RIPE. At first glance, ARIN might seem a lot more expensive than RIPE, but keep in mind that: even paying the lowest possible annual fee, you are a full member of ARIN and can receive resources directly. This means you don’t need to worry about your LIR going under; and ARIN has reserved pools of IPv4 addresses that can be immediately allocated if you qualify for them. Given that the market rate of an IPv4 /24 is around $1000/year, and that you will need to pay the full LIR fee to even get on RIPE’s waitlist for a /24, ARIN’s $250/year fee for a /24 seems quite reasonable. ARIN also has an IPv4 waitlist, but at least you don’t pay for the resources until you receive them and you can request up to a /22 at once. In conclusion, RIPE seems like a decent choice for a beginner on a budget trying to get the cheapest ASN and an IPv6 block possible, as long as the caveat with PA addresses is understood. For a more serious network operating in ARIN’s service region, especially one looking to run IPv4, ARIN is a strong contender. Note that you can get IP space from one RIR and announce it with an ASN from another RIR without issue. I personally operate AS200351, an ASN from RIPE, with IP space from ARIN. If I were starting next year, given the knowledge that I have now, I would probably have just gone with ARIN for everything. Getting an ASN First, regardless of RIR, you need to have two peers to justify having an ASN. You can ask people in the IPv6 networking discord if they are willing to peer. You are also strongly encouraged to familiarize yourself with the policies of your chosen RIR: For RIPE, these are RIPE-804 for IPv4, RIPE-738 for IPv6, and RIPE-679 for ASNs; and For ARIN, this is the NRPM. If you choose to use RIPE, you will need to find an LIR with a good reputation that charges reasonable fees and get some PA addresses from them, which they should be able to allocate very quickly, then request an ASN. Many LIRs offer some IP+ASN bundle that does both together. If you are unsure which LIR to pick, feel free to ask in the IPv6 networking discord, and I’ll also post some recommendations below. Once you’ve done this, you will need to: Register an RIPE NCC Access account; Create a person and maintainer pair in the RIPE database (the form should be self-explanatory); Create an “organisation” object in the RIPE database. For org-name, use your legal name or the name of a company that you control. For mnt-ref, enter the mntner you created earlier. By the way, you will also need to add a second mnt-ref entry later for your LIR to be able to assign you an ASN or IP space, and they should tell you which one to add. Everything else should be self-explanatory; Give the chosen LIR information on all the objects you’ve created in the RIPE database and probably pay them as well; Sign an agreement with the LIR; Wait for the LIR to give you an identity verification link from RIPE4 and then complete the verification; and Wait for RIPE to issue your ASN. If you are going with ARIN, they have video guides for setting up your Org ID and requesting IP addresses. You want to create an Org ID, sign the Registration Services Agreement, request an initial allocation for IPv6, then request an ASN. What to do with an ASN Once you have an ASN, there are a few things you should probably do: Create an AS-set for your AS-macro, which I talked about earlier. You want to create this in the database of whichever RIR you used. You should use the hierarchical form, naming it something like ASx:as-all where x is your ASN, and add your own ASN as its sole member; and (Optional but recommended) Register on PeeringDB and create a profile for your ASN on it. You can use mine as a reference. Then, you will need to find a BGP-capable server or colocation provider and pick an IP range (/24 or larger for IPv4, /48 or larger for IPv6) to announce from that server. You will most likely need to ask your provider to request a BGP session, at which point you should tell them your ASN, AS-macro, and the IP ranges you plan to announce. They may send a random string to the contact on your organization object or the aut-num object for your ASN in the RIR whois database and ask you to produce it, or ask you to set up RPSL declaring that your provider is allowed to act as your upstream. In the latter case, if you received AS64500 and your upstream is AS64510, you will need to add the following lines to your aut-num object: import: from AS64510 accept ANY export: to AS64510 announce AS64500:as-all You can set up a basic BGP session with any BGP daemon. I would recommend using whatever your BGP-capable router uses, or bird if you are just using a Linux server. If you are using bird, you can build a configuration yourself with the sample snippets from my bird filter library, or use a configuration generator like PathVector. Now comes the hard part—building up your own network. There are many things you can do, such as joining Internet Exchanges and getting multiple upstreams. The possibilities are endless, and I can’t begin to explain everything that’s possible. You will likely need to learn through trial and error. Good luck! If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the IPv6 networking discord, where there are many people happy to help you out. If there is popular demand, I may write a more in-depth post on setting up your ASN. Otherwise, I’d probably just continue writing about the theory. Recommendations This is when things get subjective. The providers listed here are believed to have a good reputation by me or by people that I believe to be trustworthy and charge reasonable rates. However, please use your common sense in case things change. Also, if I use an affiliate link, I will offer an unaffiliated option as well. RIPE LIRs: Cloudie Networks (non-affiliate) Scaleblade iFog (for ASN and PI only, non-affiliate) FreeTransit Note that you can probably get a PA /48 from a reputable LIR for free if you ask around on Discord. BGP-capable hosting: Accuris (non-affiliate) BuyVM (non-affiliate) Cloudie Networks in Toronto (non-affiliate) and Fremont (non-affiliate) F4 Networks (non-affiliate) iFog (non-affiliate) Limewave (non-affiliate) Vultr (non-affiliate) Xenyth (non-affiliate) These cover the ones with which I’ve had personal experience. There are more providers available on bgp.cheap and bgp.directory maintained by community members, but I can’t vouch for all of them personally. Notes Yes, RIPE, like APNIC, spells “organisation” in the British style, which is quite jarring every time I see it. ↩ Actually, it’s a bit more than that. RIPE considers sole proprietorships and partnerships to be purely fictional and requires the full legal name of the entity to be used. For example, even though I have the trade name “Dynamic Quantum Networks”, RIPE will insist that my “organisation” be called “Guanzhong Chen” or “Guanzhong Chen trading as Dynamic Quantum Networks”. This has led to disputes in the past with RIPE members over certain corporate entity types. Meanwhile, ARIN happily displays just “Dynamic Quantum Networks”. This may be a vanity thing, but it’s something to keep in mind if you don’t want your full legal name on display. ↩ ARIN currently has a fee waiver that allows you to hold up to a /36 at the $250/year tier, expiring at the end of 2026, after which you must pay $500/year for it. ↩ RIPE will directly verify your identity. Your LIR may also ask for identity verification themselves, because RIPE penalizes them if they apply for resources on behalf of customers that fail this verification. In these cases, be careful and make sure your LIR is storing your identity document securely. ↩ You may also be interested in… Diving into IP Addresses and Route Authorization Last time, we dived into autonomous systems and relationships.

But you get your GUAs from your ISP normally, which means if you change your ISP you need to renumber your network. They also generally frown on NPT66. So the supported solution is to get PI space. But to get PI space you need to have an ASN first, which requires you to have public peers, which are you just expected to get someone to peer you and then just firewall all the incoming traffic? These seems to be the one option for stable addresses on a IPv6 network that is not vaguely disapproved of.Or what people actually do is avoid all that complexity and run IPv4 locally and use RFC1918 addreses NAT46, which seems like a self inflicted defeat to the IPv6 first aims of the IETF, IANA and the RIRs. reply adevopsguy 49 minutes agoparentCan NPTv6 be useful in these scenarios?Disclaimer: I know only the basics of IPv6 reply quantum5 8 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t actually need an ASN to get PI though?

Learn more Contents hide (Top) Origin of name Other contexts See also Notes References Jesus nut 4 languages Article Talk Read Edit View history Tools From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Not to be confused with Jesus freak. The Main rotor attach nut, or \"Jesus nut\", from a Bell 222U, shown in hand for size perspective (left) and installed with locking key (right) Jesus nut is a slang term for the main rotor retaining nut[1] or mast nut, which holds the main rotor to the mast of some helicopters. The related slang term Jesus pin refers to the lock pin used to secure the retaining nut. More generally, Jesus nut (or Jesus pin) has been used to refer to any component that is a single point of failure which results in catastrophic consequences, and the only thing left to do is, metaphorically speaking, pray to Jesus, hence the name. Origin of name[edit] The term Jesus nut may have been coined by American soldiers in Vietnam;[2] the Vietnam War was the first war to feature large numbers of soldiers riding in helicopters. The term may also have originated with the PBY Catalina, which had two Jesus bolts holding the wing onto the fuselage.[3] If the Jesus nut were to fail in flight, the rotor would detach from the helicopter[4][a] and the only thing left for the crew to do would be to \"pray to Jesus.\" The nut/pin must be checked before the flight even though real examples of the Jesus nut/pin failing are rare. For example, in 2000, the mast nut of a Bell 206B was removed to be repainted and was not restored and checked prior to a test flight. The helicopter crashed within ten minutes of takeoff, killing the two occupants.[5][6] Some more recent helicopter systems do not have a Jesus nut.[citation needed] Other contexts[edit] More recently, the term has been more generically applied throughout engineering to include any single component whose failure would cause catastrophic failure of the entire system. Another use for the term is found in rock climbing, in which it refers to the first piece of protection (some of which are also called \"nuts\") placed on a pitch.[7] This piece must be placed to resist an outward pull as well as a downward pull in order to avoid the possibility of a \"zipper\", in which the outward pull on the rope from the belayer arresting a falling climber pulls protection pieces from the bottom up. In addition, the Jesus nut prevents the possibility of a factor-two fall onto the belay anchor.[8] In literature, the term \"Jesus nut\" was popularized in Chickenhawk by Robert Mason, a narrative about his experiences as a pilot in the Vietnam War.[9] Marine M60A1 tankers used the term \"Jesus Pin\" in reference to a breech pin located on the 105mm main gun that needed to be removed in order to disassemble the breech block. Dropping the small pin would cause it to instantly disappear into the bowels of the tank's hull causing one or more members of the crew to cry out \"Jesus\" as an expletive.[citation needed] See also[edit] Circlip, also known as a \"Jesus clip\" Linchpin Notes[edit] ^ A failure of the Jesus nut is not the only way that the rotor can detach.

Jesus code is any code written in a way that only the author and god (Jesus) would know how it works. That is until inevitably the author forgets. Leaving Jesus as the only source of reference.It is believed that Jesus Code is the reason the second coming of Christ has not yet occurred. As Jesus would be flooded with support requests, jira tickets, and zoom meetings. (Some people believe the modern SDLC to be the devil’s way of keeping Jesus from coming.) reply gavinhoward 16 hours agoprevI briefly trained as a helicopter pilot. We do refer to it as the Jesus nut.Bit of trivia: the bigger danger to helicopters is actually the rotor slowing down too much. If that happens, the rotor will fold. Yes, centrifugal force is the major force keeping rotors in one piece.So lose your engine, and you must slam the collective down to keep rotor speed. (Nit: higher energy rotors give you more time.) reply tjohns 12 hours agoparentBut don&#x27;t slam the cyclic down too quickly, otherwise you&#x27;ll get a \"mast bump\"... which is a nice way of saying \"the main rotor just cut the helicopter&#x27;s tail in half\".

Yes, the will fold up like in cartoons. reply the_pwner224 15 hours agorootparentNeat. Apparently it&#x27;s called coning. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Coning> The tips of the rotor blades move faster through the air than the parts of the blades near the hub, so they generate more lift, which pushes the tips of the blades upwards, resulting in a slight cone shape to the rotor disc. This is balanced by centrifugal force. If rotor RPM drops too low, the rotor blades fold up with no chance of recovery.> Rotors are typically designed with washout (twist) so that lift is relatively uniform along the blades. However, because lift increases quadratically with airspeed, coning still occurs at higher RPMs.> Some helicopters such as the Bell UH-1 Iroquois are designed with \"pre-coned\" blades, which are curved downwards but lay more flat in flight. reply dclowd9901 8 hours agoparentprevTo your knowledge, has one of these nuts ever actually failed?

By Amy Nordrum archive page October 4, 2023 A rendering shows Blue Frontier's AC units on a rooftop. BLUE FRONTIER Explore the 2023 list of 15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch. Global demand for air conditioning is growing. But AC consumes lots of electricity, which comes mainly from fossil fuels, and leaks harmful refrigerants. Blue Frontier’s approach cools buildings more efficiently with alternative refrigerants, and its units store energy to avoid overwhelming the grid. Intro As global temperatures rise, millions more people will need access to air conditioning just to survive. Even those living in milder climates will increasingly rely on AC to keep their homes and workplaces comfortable. To meet this rising demand, 10 new AC units will be sold every second until 2050, according to estimates from the International Energy Agency. But perversely, AC is itself a big contributor to greenhouse gases and will exacerbate climate change unless the technology improves. Blue Frontier has one promising solution. Its AC system works to reduce humidity and cool the air in separate processes. This matters because maintaining the humidity in a space has as much impact on people’s comfort as managing temperature. But most AC systems prioritize the latter. What’s more, conventional humidity control generates even more greenhouse gases than cooling the air. Blue Frontier’s approach has two steps: First, a salty mixture known as a desiccant sucks moisture out of the air, reducing its humidity. Then, some of that now-dry air moves past a wet surface. Water evaporates back into the dry air and lowers its temperature (a process known as evaporative cooling). That cooled air then passes by the remaining air in the system and cools it, too. The company says this process makes its AC units three times more efficient than conventional systems and reduces their overall energy consumption by more than 60%. Key indicators Industry: Air conditioning Founded: 2017 Headquarters: Boca Raton, Florida, USA Notable fact: Blue Frontier is licensing technology originally developed at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which remains a close collaborator today. Potential for impact Air conditioners have gotten much more efficient over the years, but they are still responsible for about 4% of greenhouse gases released globally every year. And emissions from cooling may be five times greater by 2050, according to researchers at the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Blue Frontier’s technology could help rein in those emissions even as air conditioning becomes more essential to daily life. Air conditioners produce emissions by consuming electricity (often generated from fossil fuels) and by leaking refrigerants (which are potent greenhouse gases). Operating more efficiently allows Blue Frontier’s units to use less power. The units also contain alternative refrigerants, such as propane or a chemical compound known as R454B, that don’t pollute as much as the typical kind, known as hydrofluorocarbons. Another important feature of the startup’s system is energy storage. The salty brew absorbs moisture from the humid air during the day, but it can be dried out by a heat pump at night when electricity demand is lower. That way the drying process doesn’t place as great a burden on the grid, which effectively is a form of energy storage. Then, when the sun comes up and temperatures start to climb, Blue Frontier’s AC can run for about four hours on the energy stored within that mixture. That’s an important development, because the strain air conditioning puts on the grid during the hottest days of the year is a leading cause of blackouts and brownouts. Storing energy could shift much of that demand to off-peak times and make it easier to manage grids, particularly as they incorporate more renewable power, which can vary with the weather or time of day. After factoring in the system’s improved efficiency, alternative refrigerants, and ability to store energy, Blue Frontier estimates its air conditioner reduces greenhouse gas emissions by more than 80% compared to a conventional unit. 2023 15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch See the 2023 List Twelve ReNew Sublime Systems Ørsted NuScale Climeworks Gogoro Commonwealth Fusion Systems NotCo H2 Green Steel BYD Blue Frontier Fervo Energy Form Energy GEM Caveats Blue Frontier is still in the very early stages of proving its technology and breaking into the massive global AC industry. The company will need to show in field tests that its units work as well as it says they have in the lab—without requiring more space or maintenance than the AC units already on the market. Related Story Introducing MIT Technology Review’s 2023 list of 15 Climate Tech Companies to Watch Technology plays a crucial role in addressing one of society's most daunting threats. Blue Frontier’s CEO Daniel Betts likes to compare the transformative power of more efficient AC to that of LED lightbulbs. But LED adoption in the US was driven by efficiency standards set by the federal government and, eventually, a nationwide ban on incandescent bulbs. No similar ban is on the horizon for current AC systems. In addition, today’s technical standards and performance rating systems for AC systems (such as Energy Star in the US) don’t evaluate systems’ ability to manage both humidity and temperature, which could put new technologies like Blue Frontier’s at a disadvantage. And Blue Frontier will face plenty of competition, including from established industry leaders like Daikin that are also developing advanced cooling. That said, demand for AC is expected to skyrocket, and a variety of approaches could ultimately succeed. When So far, the company has raised at least $26 million through grants, prizes, seed funding, and a Series A round in July 2022 led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Betts says that’s enough to get them through the end of 2024. Blue Frontier’s first product will be an AC unit with a capacity similar to the air conditioners most commonly used today in commercial buildings. Eventually, the company hopes to make units suitable for homes. Next steps Two of Blue Frontier’s AC units are currently being field tested, and the company has tentative plans to install two more by the end of this year. Next year, it hopes to have 40 AC units in field tests so that it can collect enough performance data to prove their viability. Betts says the company will likely raise a Series B in 2024 to start manufacturing more units, with an aim to begin selling them in 2025.

Does it need to be flushed&#x2F;replaced periodically? Is is corrosive to its enclosure?I really wish science journalism would pay more attention to stuff like this. I&#x27;ve been burned by all the Popular Science articles from 20 years ago about zero-emission coal plans with filtered exhaust and built-in carbon capture facilities. They all sound the same, and all leave out details necessary to determine viability. I&#x27;m convinced at this point that most science journalists have simply learned to not ask questions beyond a certain point.But hey I&#x27;m happy to be surprised if this actually works. reply Johnny555 12 hours agoparent>I really wish science journalism would pay more attention to stuff like this.I think the journalist did answer your questions and the answer is \"no one knows how viable this is in the real-world, not even this company\":Blue Frontier is still in the very early stages of proving its technology and breaking into the massive global AC industry. The company will need to show in field tests that its units work as well as it says they have in the lab—without requiring more space or maintenance than the AC units already on the market. reply specialist 18 hours agoparentprevThat was my first question too. I found the following. Sadly, because journalisming is oh so hard, they omitted the actual innovations.TLDR: Novel liquid desiccant functions as a \"humidity battery\" (my phrase). A salt solution which captures and releases moisture. It&#x27;s closed loop and doesn&#x27;t need to be replenished.

Our first step towards achieving this goal is the commercialization of a revolutionary air conditioning technology. Blue Frontier’s AC system combines dew-point-style sensible cooling with liquid desiccant dehumidification to reduce electricity use by up to 90% (non-fan). The desiccant is recharged and stored when electricity is the cleanest or lowest cost, and later used to deliver cooling when electricity is dirty or costly. These features enable our system to solve an array of today’s largest sustainability problems — from the Duck Curve to peak load management, from humidity control to integration of intermittent renewable resources.\"Note the \"Duck Curve\" bit.

As GP asks, the matter of maintenance was forgotten.Recently I heard someone is trying this again with water heaters. The working fluid has roughly four times the heat capacity of water, so your “water” heater is substantially a fluid heater with either no water tank or a very small one. Incoming water is heated with the fluid, and the fluid is heated on demand. Only the heat exchanger has maintenance concerns.Driving the whole thing with a heat pump makes the math a little more fiddly, since peak pump efficiency and peak power prices overlap some of the same parts of the day. You’re calculating BTUs per dollar, not watt hours per dollar. reply Retric 15 hours agorootparentIt’s already cheap to just use a larger water heater as the thermal battery.Few households use more than 80 gallons of hot water per day which is still within the normal range of hot water heaters. Just add a timer so it doesn’t kick on until powers cheap and you’ll be good to go. At least assuming your cheap electricity window is long enough to fully heat the water.This is one of the reasons people overestimate the need for grid energy storage. People time shift electricity to the night because it’s cheap. If it was cheaper 10AM-4PM then significant demand would shift to that window. reply criddell 12 hours agorootparent> significant demand would shift to that windowSounds like we would need “smart” water heaters that can query energy prices. That most likely means they would be online sharing all kinds of data most of us probably don’t want shared and would have a small monthly fee.

The solution is very hygroscopic.2)The diluted solution is pumped through a solar water heater, and then into the top of a second, similar cooling tower; the hot solution gives up moisture to outside air and increases in concentration.3)The still-warm solution is then pumped through a radiator to chill it, and then further chilled by another radiator placed at the top of a third vertical water chiller which acts as a swamp cooler, spraying water down into a pipe circulating outside air.I imagine there might be room for further optimization, like leveraging some of the heat from some other steps to pre-warm solution, etc - similar to how steam boilers use &#x27;economizers&#x27; and such. reply Ballas 3 hours agorootparentThank you. I have decided not to watch anymore of their videos after a number of inaccurate statements made as fact that was disproven with a single Google search.

Amazing series. reply Night_Thastus 18 hours agoprevOh, so it&#x27;s a swamp cooler, but one that pre-dries the air passively?It could work, in some climates. But yeah, the cost and rate you need to replace the desiccant is the critical factor. In my experience, most commercial users don&#x27;t want to screw with their AC systems more than once a year, and want it to \"just work\" without bothering with &#x27;unnecessary&#x27; things like preventative maintenance.If it needs replacement on the order of once a month or more, then I doubt this will go anywhere. reply calfuris 17 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s a closed loop system. The desiccant is regenerated occasionally, which can usually be arranged to happen at desirable times (cheaper&#x2F;cleaner electricity depending on your priorities). The regeneration is done with a heat pump, so if it can be accomplished at a relatively low temperature the COP could be spectacular for seasonal use cases. reply Night_Thastus 17 hours agorootparentSo they use a heat pump to heat the desiccant and remove the moisture?Maintenance on this thing sounds like a nightmare. It&#x27;s a heat pump and an evaporative cooler all in one.I can see how it would work in theory, but I&#x27;m curious how it would hold up practically ~5-10 years into use. reply infecto 17 hours agoparentprevClosed loop system, never needs to be replaced. reply 4hg4ufxhy 18 hours agoparentprevSounds perfect for AC subscription service. reply Night_Thastus 17 hours agorootparentWhen money is even slightly tight, AC maintenance feels like the first thing to go.

If nothing else your insurance will check before paying out.You might adjust the temperature when things get tight - which saves a lot more money - but most keep it maintained. reply ilyt 15 hours agorootparentI dunno, from my experience of having small server room in company I work for with 2 AC units the devices will fail when they want to fail and aside from cleaning maintenance never found actual issue before it happened in both units.Seemed like moving it to be done every 2 years would just save us money reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentOther than replacing the belts and filters there isn&#x27;t much you can do. They should be a sealed system where there is nothing that can be done once it leaves the factory. Those belts are filters are important to maintain - they only stop a minority of failures though. reply hypercube33 17 hours agorootparentprevsave money in power that you trade for time (labor) and expendibles seems like a failure reply Night_Thastus 17 hours agorootparentDepends on how often the desiccant needs to be replaced and its cost.If it&#x27;s once a year and costs as much as the filters do, and saves 20% power, then it&#x27;s a no-brainer.If it&#x27;s once a month and cost 1k each, saves 5% energy, then it&#x27;s pointless.We don&#x27;t know the numbers, so can&#x27;t say for sure. replyhn_throwaway_99 18 hours agoprevSo basically, as I understand it, the full process is as follows, starting with dry dessicant:1. External air is blown over the dessicant, which pulls moisture out of the air.2. That dry air is then blown over water, which rehumidifies the air and also cools it by evaporative cooling. This part here is essentially the same as a swamp cooler.3. The air is then cooled further by what is essentially a normal air conditioner, but which doesn&#x27;t have to work as hard because the water is already cooler from step #2.4. The dessicant, though, needs to be dried out, so as the article explains it I think the desiccant is heated by a heat pump to dry it out.Please someone correct me if my understanding is wrong. It&#x27;s an interesting design which basically combines a swamp cooler with a heat pump (after all, AC is just a heat pump that pumps heat out of the house). I&#x27;m skeptical of the 60% number though given the extra energy that needs to be applied to dry out the desiccant. reply 0xfae 18 hours agoparentYou could use the waste heat from the heat pump (standard A&#x2F;C) in step 3 to heat&#x2F;dry the desiccant in step #1. That heat is, like you said, just dumped outside now. Why not make use of it? reply ilyt 15 hours agorootparentSimilarly we could use air exhaust from home itself to heat up AC in the winter reply xenadu02 16 hours agoparentprevWith regard to regenerating the desiccant:Presumably the same heat pump used for the normal A&#x2F;C cycle would be used to handle this. Add some valves and controllable dampers which are potential failure points but not expensive. Instead of dampers you could have a separate exhaust fan but either way you need to extract the hot and very humid air from the regen cycle to avoid dumping it into the building.There&#x27;s a tricky optimization problem for a system like this. In heat pump mode your ideal time of day is around solar noon when temps are hottest... with an inverter (fully variable) compressor and fan you can run both at lower power to generate just enough heat needed for regen. That can clash with your cooling load and electric rates though so it may make more sense to run at night when you need to run longer or higher power to generate enough heat.Most consumer A&#x2F;C systems sold in the US don&#x27;t even have inverter compressors yet so that is some added cost&#x2F;complexity. Many have variable speed indoor and outdoor fans but not all. There may be some decent gains to be had just by adopting the latest \"conventional\" refrigeration tech. reply adrianmonk 13 hours agorootparentI wonder if you could just pump the liquid desiccant outside, do the drying outdoors, and then pump it back inside. Then you wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about air handling for the moist air.When retrofitting a house to replace traditional AC with this, it may not be easy to get air from where the AC is located (usually the middle of the house) to the outside. If you pump desiccant outside, maybe you can squeeze desiccant hoses in right next to your refrigerant lines.Also, there&#x27;s all that waste heat outside at the condenser anyway. It seems like you could use that heat to help dry the desiccant. I guess that creates a different tricky optimization problem: if you wait too long to start drying your desiccant at night, when you finally do, you risk making the house too cold because you are stealing its heat. Maybe you just pause desiccant drying until whenever AC is needed again. reply sushibowl 18 hours agoparentprevCould you use the heat pumped out of the house by the AC to dry the desiccant? reply malfist 18 hours agoparentprevI wonder if it&#x27;s using the waste heat from the AC to dry the dessicant reply gottorf 19 hours agoprev> The startup&#x27;s AC units suck moisture out of the air for more efficient cooling.As someone who lives in the Gulf Coast area, any amount of moisture sucked out of the air is welcome.

I made a similar comment but deleted when I saw yours.I&#x27;ve got a half-ton central dehumidifier that has to run 24&#x2F;7 basically all year.If I could just flow my HVAC over some desiccant instead... I am all ears on this one. reply hn_throwaway_99 18 hours agoparentprevBut the AC unit then adds all the moisture back in for evaporative cooling. reply analyte123 17 hours agoprevDehumidification is really under-explored. If you live in Florida or the Gulf Coast (or similar areas around the world), your home can be at risk of mold and humidity damage during shoulder seasons when the AC is not frequently running (not to mention thermal discomfort [1]). And, dehumidification is key to reducing indoor allergens in these climates, particularly dust mites and mold.What I couldn&#x27;t figure out is if there are any circumstances where running a traditional condenser dehumidifier (whole-house, in the attic) would save you energy&#x2F;money for the same thermal comfort range. A DoE simulation study I can&#x27;t find says no, but some HVAC forum posters say that it can, and based on experience I&#x27;m inclined to think it could in some circumstances. The desiccant wheel dehumidifiers seem to get a lot more water out per kWh [2], making it a win as seen in this new integrated technology.However, running a floor dehumidifier dumps 800+ watts of waste heat into the space you&#x27;re dehumidifying, making it impractical for thermal comfort with condensers and maybe even desiccants.

It gives a noticeable improvement in indoor air quality, but I can definitely see it on my electric usage. (I wish I could un-see it.

Then, some of that now-dry air moves past a wet surface. Water evaporates back into the dry airHuh? They dried the air and then wetted it? Makes no sense, so I googled it:> The operation of a desiccant cooling system is based on the use of a rotary dehumidifier (desiccant wheel) in which air is dehumidified. The resulting dry air is somewhat cooled in a sensible heat exchanger (rotary regenerator), and then further cooled by an evaporative cooler. The resulting cool air is directed into a room. The system may be operated in a closed cycle or more commonly in an open cycle in ventilation or recirculation modes. A heat supply is needed to regenerate the desiccant. Low-grade heat at a temperature of about 60–95°C is sufficient for regeneration, so renewable energies such as solar and geothermal heat as well as waste heat from conventional fossil-fuel systems may be used. The system is simple and thermal coefficient of performance (COP) is usually satisfactory.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;topics&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;desiccant-c... reply owenversteeg 18 hours agoprevTLDR: it uses a desiccant to dry the air before it passes through an evaporative cooler, thus pre-cooling the air. At night when power is cheap it uses a heat pump to dry the desiccant. You can get 4 hours use out of the desiccant. They also use alternative refrigerants \"such as propane\" but I do not see how that would improve efficiency, there are plenty of A&#x2F;Cs using that today.I don&#x27;t quite get how this reduces the energy consumption - I must be missing something here, or they&#x27;ve PR-ified it and it doesn&#x27;t actually reduce total energy consumption, just reduces peak load.Adding water to salt and then removing it is at best an energy neutral process and in practice obviously involves losses and heat you cannot harvest (warm water vapor coming off of warm drying salt!) These A&#x2F;C systems exist - search \"desiccant enhanced evaporative cooling\" - and have gotten more or less nowhere in the real world as far as I know.Am I missing something here or is there any actual total energy savings? reply owenversteeg 17 hours agoparentIdeas I&#x27;ve had so far:- dry out desiccant using sunlight or other heat ?- waste heat while the A&#x2F;C is in operation helps dry the desiccant?- take advantage of some natural humidity difference to partially dry it?- take advantage of other sources of waste heat, which are semi-plentiful in environments where you use A&#x2F;C, to dry it?That said, none of these happen at night, which is when the article says it&#x27;s dried... also some would involve physically moving the desiccant around which magnifies complexity... reply infecto 17 hours agoparentprevI think they are the energy reduction is their novel closed loop desiccant system in a typical package unit. reply purplezooey 13 hours agoprevI hope it reaches mass production.

If it&#x27;s happening outdoors then wouldn&#x27;t there be issues (particularly in high humidity regions) extracting enough moister from the dry air before sending it forward?I have wondered if in particularly arid regions where swamp cooling is a thing, if it wouldn&#x27;t make sense to use evaporation cooling in conjunction with a condenser coil to push the temps indoors down a lot further. reply gloryless 19 hours agoprevAC is a fairly nuanced problem, and I like to see evaporative cooling getting an update.

It just breaks people expectations that a big, complicated machine uses less energy than simply setting something on fire. reply sumtechguy 15 hours agorootparentthey are more efficient long term. short term though it is &#x27;it is cold in here turn up the heat&#x27; the time it takes a heat pump to make that happen is much longer than say a natural gas system. the NG system uses more energy though to do it in a shorter amount of time. but it happens perception wise faster. reply RC_ITR 13 hours agorootparentprevMy reasoning is that everyone in the US had parents who knew you&#x27;d die if you didn&#x27;t heat your house, but in most cases, AC is a comfort thing, so AC was treated as the luxury and heat as the normal. reply spandextwins 13 hours agoprevIsn’t that like the Tesla heat pump? reply timbit42 17 hours agoprevHow does this compare to an air-to-air heat pump? reply SV_BubbleTime 10 hours agoprev [–] This is an ad. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
