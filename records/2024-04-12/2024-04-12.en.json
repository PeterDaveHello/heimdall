I initially wanted to comment that this looks a lot like time-domain reflectometry on a conceptual level - but as Cindy Harnett seems to be your advisor, you probably know that already :) reply 00702 16 hours agoparentIndeed! How do you know her? reply raphman 13 hours agorootparentOh, just from reading her papers. I have been playing with TDR a long time ago [1] and try to follow current developments. [1] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2047196.2047264 reply smoyer 8 hours agoparentprevI did some work on TDR analysis when analyzing CATV fraud detection but it turns out that we generally know where on the fiber plant each CPE is and collecting the DOCS IS timing data from those devices is essentially free. reply OisinMoran 9 hours agoprevThis is really neat—thanks for sharing! I love the general idea of making materials more \"self-aware\" or inspectable. It's very sci fi! The research I did before my current job touched ever so slightly on this too, so even cooler to see it on the front page. What we were doing was using complex valued neural nets to learn the transmission matrix of an optical fibre. It was previously done in the optics community by propagating Maxwell's equations, but we were able to beat the state of the art by a few orders of magnitude with a very simple architecture (the actual physics just boils down to a single complex matrix multiplication!). The connection to your work here is that if the fibre is bent you have to relearn a new matrix. It could even be possible to learn some parameterized characterisation of the fibre, so you could say do some input/output measurements and use that to model a spline of the fibre. We did not get that far though! Here are the papers if you're interested: CS-focussed one: https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/hash/148510031... Physics-focussed one: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10057-8 reply spiderxxxx 8 hours agoparentcould it detect a twist instead of a bend? reply OisinMoran 35 minutes agorootparentInteresting! I'm not sure to be honest. I imagine in practice it's hard to get a pure twist without any bending, and if the system can't detect any difference with a twist then the need to detect it is also nullified as it is effectively the same system. reply jjk166 15 hours agoprevThis is fantastic! One can easily imagine some minor refinements that would allow this to be mass producible with very high accuracy. And the applications are abundant. I imagine you could use space filling curves to make 2D or 3D sensors that could cost-efficiently give robots a sense of touch. Wrapped around something like a flexible tube you could make it directionally sensitive for proprioception. It's easily possible that other things that affect the air gaps like say temperature differences could be detected and localized as well. reply 00702 13 hours agoparentThere are a lot of cool applications indeed! I was able to use it to do gait for a soft robot \"leg\", but I have to wait for the paper to be published later this year before going into too much detail. reply klysm 17 hours agoprev> Thanks to an awesome advisor And there you have it! The difference between a miserable experience and a good one reply 00702 17 hours agoparentVery much so! reply downrightmike 10 hours agoprevIsn't this just the same tech as the first Nintendo Power Glove had? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g8JiGjRQNE They put light down a tube and then measured the light to trigger a key press. That's why bending your fingers/hand did anything. The revised the mechanism in the later generations. reply Doxin 3 hours agoparentI think at least one novelty here is that there's multiple \"bend points\" it can detect without needing a fiber for each bend point. reply crote 16 hours agoprevWhat an absolutely amazing idea, great work! Your sensor data seems to have quite large \"dead zones\" - those should be trivially fixable by reducing the inter-sensor distance, right? Would it be useful to sense the direction of the bend? I reckon this might be possible by dividing the tube like a Mercedes logo, and having three sets of the sensor in one outer tube. Is there a way to sense multiple bends? With the current setup that'd result in invalid readings as you're essentially OR-ing the value. Are there any good solutions for this? reply 00702 14 hours agoparentGreat ideas! Even though I haven't implemented it fully it is possible to sense multiple bends because each bend will always have the same relative attenuation (across the strands) so it would just be a matter of matching on the relative deltas from one reading to another. The catch, though, is at that at some point no light will reach the end if every joint bends a lot. There are ways to mitigate that, but my comment is too long already! reply gaudystead 14 hours agorootparentNo need to cut your comments short! You clearly have a passion, and passion is the best way to get other people interested! :D (also, nice work!) reply liamwire 4 hours agorootparentprevCould you increase power output through the fibre in response to a loss of signal, or one that falls below a given threshold? Using reasonable bounds to account for errors where attenuation isn’t the cause of no signal being received. reply ericdfoley 17 hours agoprevNot quite the same thing, but this reminds me of DAS using fiber optic cable for various acoustic sensing tasks--basically as an alternative to geophones/hydrophones. There have been a number of papers using transoceanic fibers for various monitoring tasks. That is also used for various industrial applications, e.g. for strain sensing by Luna Innovations. I know that Schlumberger has various patents on fiber-optic sensing relating to towed streamers (e.g. for marine seismic acquisition.) But I haven't seen it used for soft robotics before. reply 00702 17 hours agoparentYeah initially doing literature review was a bit daunting because of all this existing work, especially FBG-type sensors, but this idea is so fundamentally simple that its been mostly bypassed by the smarter minds reply ericdfoley 17 hours agorootparentYeah, it makes a lot of sense to just create those gaps when you're specifically installing the fiber for sensing. reply robryk 10 hours agoprevI don't understand what happens when the sensor is bent in more than one location. At the beginning you mention a ToF sensor, which made me think that you're looking at reflections from the bends and measuring distance to them, but this seems not to be the case. ISTM that if you bend the sensor in two places, you'll simply get the sum of the logattenuations from both. If we assume that the \"strength\" of the bend continuously changes attenuation, ISTM that you need as many strands as there are gap locations to be able to disambiguate between any two sets of bends. Am I misreading something or is this intended to operate in cases where we know only one bend is present? reply mariusor 3 hours agoparentIn the paragraph \"Visualization of the OptiGap Sensor System\" looks like the gap pattern from multiple sensors is providing a unique signature that can be translated into the exact location on the length of the sensors. The mechanism for translating the wave forms to actual location seems to be based on a bayesian model, according to the \"Realtime Machine Learning on a Microcontroller\" paragraph. reply karambahh 8 hours agoprevIt seems to me that the refractive index plays a role: couldn't you increase resolution by replacing air by another medium every other cut? Say air, water, air, etc. My reasoning is that you'd increase the resolution without adding too much technical complexity. My maths is too rusty to evaluate how it would mess with the gray code though. Very nice idea reply wholinator2 16 hours agoprevAs sometime about to start a PhD in theoretical physics, how did you do 3 years? I've been told a doctorate is 2 years of classes followed by 3 to 5 years of research. Did you already have a masters that you're doctorate college accepted to override class requirements? reply 00702 16 hours agoparentThe short answer? Weekly meetings with my advisor! Long answer: I also had 2 years of classes but I started working on my research immediately, while taking classes. By the time I finished all my classes and became a candidate I had one paper already published and another one accepted, so I was able to get a 3rd paper out and defend by the end of the 3rd year. reply atlas_hugged 8 hours agorootparentWow reply knodi123 14 hours agoprevThis is interesting! Although the way you have to have log2 fibers, and a different encoding in each junction, presents quite a manufacturing challenge. Oh well, it's not a problem at the research/POC phase! reply abraae 12 hours agoprevI've been looking for a sensor that can accurately detect a golf club sweeping over the top of it (how close, how quickly, arc of swing). The idea being to create a golf launch monitor that doesn't require hitting a ball, so you can play sim golf inside. Think playing alongside the Masters as you watch on TV in the lounge - without smashing a golf ball through your TV. I am wondering if this could be suitable (or a number of them ganged together). reply cglace 12 hours agoparentMy dad had something like this that hooked up to his computer in the 90's. reply speps 12 hours agoparentprevThe risk of hitting the sensor and seeing it flying across the room into the TV seems too risky. As mentioned, a high FPS camera along with the Kinect tech to extract a skeleton would work so much better. You could make that in your garage using a PlayStation Eye and existing open source tech. reply abraae 12 hours agorootparentYep, the sensor would need to be buried/encased in a mat. The club needs to make contact with the mat realistically (i.e. like taking a divot on a real grass surface). Most launch monitors today use high cameras or doppler radar. Neither of them really works without a ball. The difference between a good shot and a crap shot is a few millimetres. The technology can measure a bit of data from the club alone (club speed, angle of attack) but that's not enough to accurately extrapolate actual ball flight, since it's all about the quality of the contact of club on ball before ground. reply risenshinetech 12 hours agoparentprevThis already exists, its called the Optishot, and it doesn't work very well when compared to any modern radar or camera based sensors. reply abraae 12 hours agorootparentThe opportunity is for something that can accurately measure your golf swing without a ball. Optishot is not that: > Since no ball data is recorded, the OptiShot 2 cannot accurately read how your club impacts the ball, so if you top the ball or even miss entirely, the OptiShot 2 will show that you made solid contact. reply schrectacular 11 hours agoparentprevSeems like a hall sensor or two plus a magnetic club head is what you need reply abraae 10 hours agorootparentSome kind of electromagnetic sensor does seem like a way to go. Not sure of the practicalities of magnetising/ keeping magnetised a golf club head though. And ideally it would work with all of your clubs or at least all your metal clubs, not just one special club. reply bythreads 17 hours agoprevCongrats and if I may; your blog post should be how ph.d's are done - readable, understandable and devoid of techno mumbling. reply 00702 16 hours agoparentThank you! reply teucris 16 hours agoprevI wonder if by using a large nozzle, you could print out the entire sensor by laying out lengths of TPU with flexible joints at each air gap. It would depend on how well light traveled through the printed part though. reply 00702 16 hours agoparent3D printing does affect the light passing through significantly. There are a number of options for fabricating these but most of the successful ones involve cutting (can even use a laser cutter). reply porphyra 17 hours agoprevThat's super cool and I hope you don't mind a little bit of unsolicited feedback but the first question everyone's asking is \"what does it do?\" At present the blog post starts out with two paragraphs talking about the format of the blog post and the applications but not what the sensor actually measures. reply Netcob 15 hours agoparentThat's basically every other HN article for me. Zero context. \"Blorglorp 2024.4.99 released\" \"With the new version, Blorglorp finally sheds its libgnipgnop dependency and increases efficiency by 1.25%\". Bam, top post for the day, lots of multi-paragraph comments, and I'll still never know what it's even for. reply sandebert 14 hours agorootparentThe context tends to come some time later, when they close store. \"We at Derplabs are proud that we dared to make an opinionated jpeg viewer, Blorglorp, that only interpreted the four first bits of every byte and ignored the rest.

If you forget to use trunk the mouse is disabled for some reason… reply 00702 17 hours agoparentprevGood point -- I need to better explain what \"bend localization\" means on a more practical level pretty early on. reply oersted 17 hours agorootparent> This means the sensor can tell you where you bent it, with a predefined (and coarse) resolution. > OptiGap’s application is mainly within the realm of soft robotics, which typically involves compliant (or ‘squishy’) systems, where the use of traditional sensors is often not practical. This explanation is already quite clear. If I understood correctly, by \"predefined resolution\" you mean that it detects which silicone sleeve was bent on a tube with a series of them, correct? Can you provide more concrete examples for how you envision it being used? The first application that comes to mind is sensing how fingers bend in a glove controller. reply 00702 16 hours agorootparentThe finger bending example is certainly a classic for something like this but I think it truly shines in soft robot examples like flapping wing robots or swimming finned robot, where it's critical for sensors to be mechanically transparent so as to not impact the usually delicate dynamics. The \"soft\" robotic arm in my earlier paper is another good example https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9763962 reply IMTDb 16 hours agorootparentprevAlso; if you can please include examples of practical use cases. I am sure there are tons, but I always love discovering complexity in hidden places reply yoz 13 hours agorootparentprevHaving just read the piece for the first time after you added the \"bent rope\" explanation: YOU NAILED IT. I literally had the reaction of thinking, \"Wow, there's a super simple explanation early on! I trust this writer much more now.\" reply porphyra 17 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I guess in layman's terms it's a long squishy cable that knows where it's being bent. reply devwastaken 16 hours agorootparentprevHave a quick recording that shows an outcome or effect that is a core part of the research. reply Cerium 14 hours agoparentprevOne application for shape sensing technology is for surgical robotics.

Relevant patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240044638A1/ The first time I saw one of these in person I was in awe. You could take a normal looking cable (think bicycle cable sleeve) and bend it and see in real time the same shape on the display. reply nuancebydefault 14 hours agoparentprevThis question surprises me. Bend location == locate where something is bent. Then some video's of the researcher bending a tube. Is there any confusion possible? reply porphyra 14 hours agorootparentOP updated his blog post after I posted my comment. The opening paragraphs are now very clear and awesome. reply nuancebydefault 13 hours agorootparentOh - thanks for pointing this out! reply rcarmo 14 hours agoprevThis, sir, is sheer genius. I genuinely loved your approach and the way you wrote it down. reply riedel 14 hours agoprevHave you explored fiber bragg grating. 10 years ago a student of mine semi successfully explored sensing the shape of firefighter hose using that technique. Seems to gain new traction again lately for optical shape sensing. reply 00702 14 hours agoparentI explored FBG sensors early on and they are very cool -- I was aiming for a less expensive and more robotics-oriented application. Something that can be seamlessly integrated into a design at a lower level without the complexity of FBG technology. reply Prcmaker 11 hours agorootparentI think you made the right choice. You've come up with a great sensor topology. FBGs are good, but there's so much to them that is just infuriating. I ended up late in my optics work spending most of my time finding ways to avoid them. reply Prcmaker 11 hours agoparentprevThe perpetual issue with FBGs is cost, in my experience. For quality sensors, you can use cheap fibre with expensive detectors, or cheap detectors with expensive fibre. There's been a perpetual promise of the tech getting cheaper, but never seems to really drop significantly. We always struggled to find buyers once they saw the price tag. reply Prcmaker 11 hours agoprevVery cool! I used to build sensors similar in construction, but in all glass. Was a great challenge and a lot of fun. I like your spin on things. Well done completing the Phd! reply skoocda 15 hours agoprevThis is awesome! Presumably you can make this work with any interface that doesn't enforce the total internal reflectivity of a fiber optic cable, and therefore allows light to leak out. Instead of an air gap, have you tried experimenting with removing the cladding of the fiber optic cable, but keeping the core intact? Alteratively, could you use a short segment of colored cladding that allows certain wavelengths to leak out more than others? I think that would allow you to encode each bend point as a different color-- which might require a different (more expensive) rx sensor, but could be useful for certain applications. reply maxnoe 15 hours agoprevVery Cool! Since you mentioned the visualization part, let me comment on my pet pieve: The rainbow / jet color map should not be used for anything. It distorts your data and is not accessible for people with color vision deficiencies. If you want to know more, have a look here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps... and this talk here: https://youtu.be/xAoljeRJ3lU reply Glyptodon 11 hours agoprevCould you get a similar effect by cutting dimples or notches in patterns (like a helical line of small conical holes) along the whole length in a sleeve instead of using separate pieces and infer overall curve shape? Or do the segments need to be cut completely through? reply mhb 15 hours agoprevThanks for sharing your work. Would you be able to compare your device to the fiber optic one used in the data glove (e.g., https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2464/1/...). reply 00702 13 hours agoparentThere are a lot of similarities in the approach to the linked paper (which is a very cool concept) and I saw a lot of similar concepts in my lit review. At a high level, my sensor targets bend localization with simple fabrication techniques while the linked paper is doing more general camera-based gesture recognition. I have a more thorough comparison to existing work in my actual dissertation. Our lab has done a good bit of work around elastomers similar to the linked paper, such as multitouch pressure sensing (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9674750). The authors of your linked paper can actually achieve what they've done with a single light source by using one of these!

I hope your PhD continues well, and that this invention serves you in the future. Do you put any lube on the interface between the silicone sleeve and optical cable? I imagine the bending action will cause displacement, and friction there could rub and/or cause the nominal position to shift around. reply 00702 13 hours agoparentSince the sleeve is a stretchy rubber as long as the inner diameter of it is a bit smaller than the outer diameter of the fiber it holds just fine. For more dynamic applications, though, a silicone adhesive, or even super glue for more permanent strands, helps! reply datadrivenangel 16 hours agoprevLove the use of lower cost materials and nice jankier DIY SCIENCE. 00702, 4th photo caption appears to be missing the word gap. :) reply 00702 15 hours agoparentFixed -- thanks!

Very nice work reply 00702 17 hours agoparentThanks! reply hervature 14 hours agoprev> also be doable in 3 years I would like to add more color to this. 3 year PhD is very possible for a motivated individual at, what I'll call, the low end of R1 universities. That doesn't mean you cannot do good research (the OP is a counterexample) but that there is a fundamental difference between the program that the OP went to and top-tier universities. Think Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, etc. It is normally pretty easy to distinguish these programs because they focus a lot on the course requirements and that the thesis counts as a course. From the OP's institution, you can see that the course load is at least 15 courses and I would not be surprised if some students do 20 [1]. These programs are more or less an advanced undergraduate with a real independent research project that spans multiple years. Conversely, top-tier universities typically operate under the \"publish 3 things and you have satisfied the thesis requirements\". This cannot be explicitly written and this is normally difficult to ascertain online. For example, Harvard has similar requirements [2] but you can still find it for some departments [3]. The Catch-22 with this is that someone who can publish 3 things in 3 years can publish 6 things (or more) in 5 years which will greatly increase their academic job prospects. Thus, at top-tier universities, even the best students stay for 5 years at a minimum to start working the job market. You need to be at Dantzig's level to finish at a top-tier in 3 years [4]. To summarize, if you want to finish a PhD in 3 years, look for course-heavy programs and don't expect to get hired into academia. Edit: I see the OP commented somewhere else that they published 3 papers. The OP is obviously a standout but I think most people have to be realistic that very few areas of research allow for publications in your first year PhD. For example, if you are doing research in LLMs, you are looking at a couple of years just to be brought up to speed. [1] - https://catalog.louisville.edu/graduate/programs-study/docto...

[4] - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig reply kiwih 6 hours agoparentIn my experience in computer engineering in the academic systems of the USA, New Zealand, and Australia, a very large proportion of students will write their first paper in their first year. It is field dependent, but when I was a postdoc at a top US R1, 100% of the students I interacted with had their first paper in their first year. These even included students working on LLMs :-) Also, top non-US universities often graduate their engineering students within 3-4 years of commencing, with 3-4 papers being a very common international expectation as well. If you want to finish a PhD in 3 years and are interested in academia, in addition to following the path the OP has laid out you may also look to good international universities and then get your next 3-4 papers as a postdoc. reply hervature 2 hours agorootparentI appreciate adding data for the crowd but \"a very large proportion of students will write their first paper in their first year\" is simply not true when talking about the whole population. My department, albeit not CS but stats/ML, the first year is dedicated to doing courses and preparing for the qualifying exams. Some students would publish a paper. A few more might be coauthors with an upper year student (read, very little involvement). Pretty close to half would not even have an advisor until the summer. I studied at, supposedly to US News, a top 10 in the US for CS. Typically, non-US universities have 3 year undergrads and 2 year masters prior to PhD. End-to-end, you are looking at the same time. There are, of course, exceptions. UK I think shaves off a year by integrating undergrad and masters. Hiding the years or a PhD by doing an extended postdoc is barely the point of the exercise. The median time for a CS PhD in the US is 7 years [1]. Subtract 2 years for good students but add a year postdoc and I think you have a realistic 5-6 years from start of PhD to first academic position for the top decile.

    "originBody": "(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window)(opens in a new window) Link Copied Security Apple alerts users in 92 nations to mercenary spyware attacks Manish Singh@refsrc / 4:54 AM UTC•April 11, 2024 Comment Image Credits: James Leynse/Corbis (opens in a new window) / Getty Images Apple sent threat notifications to iPhone users in 92 countries on Wednesday, warning them that they may have been targeted by mercenary spyware attacks. The company said it sent the alerts to individuals in 92 nations at 12 p.m. Pacific Time Wednesday. The notification, which TechCrunch has seen, did not disclose the attackers’ identities or the countries where users received notifications. “Apple detected that you are being targeted by a mercenary spyware attack that is trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID -xxx-,” it wrote in the warning to affected customers. “This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously,” Apple added in the text. The iPhone maker sends these kind of notifications multiple times a year and has notified users to such threats in over 150 countries since 2021, per an updated Apple support page. Apple also sent an identical warning to a number of journalists and politicians in India in October last year. Later, nonprofit advocacy group Amnesty International reported that it had found Israeli spyware maker NSO Group’s invasive spyware Pegasus on the iPhones of prominent journalists in India. (Users in India are among those who have received Apple’s latest threat notifications, according to people familiar with the matter.) The spyware alerts arrive at a time when many nations are preparing for elections. In recent months, many tech firms have cautioned about rising state-sponsored efforts to sway certain electoral outcomes. Apple’s alerts, however, did not remark on their timing. “We are unable to provide more information about what caused us to send you this notification, as that may help mercenary spyware attackers adapt their behavior to evade detection in the future,” Apple told affected customers. Apple previously described the attackers as “state-sponsored” but has replaced all such references with “mercenary spyware attacks.” The warning to customers adds: “Mercenary spyware attacks, such as those using Pegasus from the NSO Group, are exceptionally rare and vastly more sophisticated than regular cybercriminal activity or consumer malware.” Apple said it relies solely on “internal threat-intelligence information and investigations to detect such attacks.” “Although our investigations can never achieve absolute certainty, Apple threat notifications are high-confidence alerts that a user has been individually targeted by a mercenary spyware attack and should be taken very seriously,” it added.

The interesting thing IMO is they claim to just be some random college student. Which seems believable because if they were a real secret squirrel I guess they wouldn’t ask reddit about it, haha. I wonder if the hackers are targeting people based on phone numbers or something.

Of course we'd have to identify \"targeted\", personally I wouldn't include \"your name ended up on a list after someone grepped a bunch of data\".

Example: Some people think San Junipero, the one positive Black Mirror episode with an actual Happily Ever After romantic ending is a dystopian vision. Some people think the Primer, the technological device at the heart of Diamond Age, is the problem, not the Neo-Victorian aristocrats like Elizabeth's parents with their pseudo-colonial control over part of China, not the huge corporations whose greed is tearing the world apart and their engineers like Fiona's father, nor the Cyberpunks left over from a previous era like Nell's father - no the problem is the machine. In the Tweet framing it's easy, it's named a Torment Nexus and the book is literally titled \"Don't Create The Torment Nexus\" but what about the Horseless Carriage? The Novel? The Television? Are we creating the Urban Sprawl, the Wasted Youth, are we helping to Manufacture Consent ? Or maybe these are Freedom and Art for the Masses ? Framing. reply kibwen 9 hours agorootparent> Some people think San Junipero, the one positive Black Mirror episode with an actual Happily Ever After romantic ending is a dystopian vision. IIRC, after the couple prances away hand-in-hand into the sunset, the camera pulls back through the fourth wall to reveal the darkened server room in which their minds are being emulated, blinkenlights glittering in the darkness among the monotone drone of case fans, zooming out to reveal an endless row of servers receding into the distant blackness in a scene reminiscent of The Matrix. If the showrunners intended it to be unambiguously happy, I feel like they would have omitted that part... Or maybe I'm hallucinating, because I found the implications utterly horrifying, much to my partner's consternation. reply godelski 7 hours agorootparentNot to mention that Black Mirror's entire agenda is near-Sci-Fi horror. The episode is specifically about getting trapped in nostalgia, a non-existent past. Yes, love is found in this pursuit, but so it death. All the music in the show is about living in a box and forgetting about the real world. Other characters talk about forgetting they're in the simulation and they talk about how they live in a graveyard. There's that hole conversation with Greg about how the timelimit exists so people don't kill themselves to permanently leave the world behind and \"live\" in San Junipero forever. And I'd expect of all people HN people (computer people) would understand that uploading into a simulated reality is not the same as you entering that reality. Remember, once \"you\" are data, you can be copied. Then who is the real you. If you can be uploaded without being killed in the process then certainly that entity is not \"you,\" but rather a different entity who has all your memories and is not able to distinguish itself from you. But you are still experiencing your experiences and not their experiences, so you are different entities. It is just an AI double. The promise of an afterlife is no different than the promises of old. A story to help you move on, to help you find comfort in the end. But this story is just more tangible for those who are left. San Junipero is not much different from many of the other stories who approach this topic. Even the happier Upload is quite dystopian between the lines of being a rom-com. It is that happiness that is the dystopia itself, the lure of false promises. The poisoned desert so sweet and tempting it is impossible to not take a bite. reply tialaramex 1 hour agorootparent> Remember, once \"you\" are data, you can be copied. If you're copied that's what \"Hang the DJ\" is about, and more darkly the short story \"Lena\". But San Junipero deliberately doesn't do that. Alas, the thing you claim isn't the same as being is in fact exactly how you work today. Is this an existential nightmare? I got used to it pretty quickly, and in San Junipero you'd have a lot longer to get used to it. Greg Egan posits that, to the extent consciousness is anything it's somehow a consequence of patterns of computation. That is, if somehow the same patterns that you represent came into existence again they'd \"be\" you in every sense that matters. The \"Lena\" scenario remains horrifying, all those copies are the same person, instantiated over, and over, and over again to do menial tasks. But San Junipero is just life after death. reply godelski 1 hour agorootparentThe Permutation City reference is irrelevant to San Junipero. I never made the claim that the entities in the simulation were not sentient. I made the claim that they aren't \"you.\" These are very different things. I haven't seen the newer seasons. But looking at the synopsis on wiki (Beyond the Sea?), this is a very different scenario. Permutation City might be a better one to look at for what I'm getting at. Remember in that story that you are essentially making a copy of yourself and putting it into that universe. That entity is not you, but it is sentient, conscious, and it's own thing. But you aren't in that simulation with it unless you virtually go in (and in their scenario you need to deal with the time differential). San Junipero is a corporation promising you life after death. The same way Amazon Prime's Upload does. But San Junipero in Black Mirror itself made no claim, and the writers place a lot of not so subtle hints as to the idea that it isn't. Not only by nature of being a Black Mirror episode, but I suggest you look closer at the soundtrack of the episode and how its used in context. reply tialaramex 0 minutes agorootparent> I made the claim that they aren't \"you.\" These are very different things. I understand what you're claiming, as I pointed out under this understanding your current existence is already terrifying. Not just when you fall asleep, but even moment by moment the underpinning compute substrate is repaired and replaced and yet it feels as though this is an ongoing experience, there's no reason Yorkie experiences this any differently even though intellectually she knows the transformation was more... substantial. It's just Trigger's Broom / the Ship of Theseus, this isn't even a new idea. > the writers place a lot of not so subtle hints as to the idea that it isn't. Like the hint where Charlie Brooker specifically said that no it's the Happily Ever After ending ? Maybe he wasn't patting his head like you knew he would be if he was addressing True Fans like you ? Didn't give the secret sign ? I thought I already spelled this out well enough, that somebody will insist that the heroes are villains, that the bad guys are the good guys and so on. Sometimes they have a point, but more often they just didn't see what was in front of them. I am kinda tangentially interested in the Slash scene (e.g. I know people involved in AO3) and the Slash communities are the same - sometimes you're like sure, this was barely subtext in the movie/ TV show/ novel, in a braver world the writers would have had them kiss on camera, but other times it's like \"Where did this even come from? Were you watching the same show?\" - and sometimes that's deliberate contrariness but other times it really isn't. It's not as though I don't have my own divergences from what writers believe about their own works - for example in my opinion Firefly was a TV show about the bad guys (people who lost a civil war and just decide that doesn't count) written by someone who doesn't understand that they're the bad guys. Obvious Whedon doesn't agree and I don't expect him to. Or for example Vinge insisted he doesn't know who/what Rabbit is in \"Rainbows End\" and in my opinion there's only one option which makes any sense. But I guess I kinda asked for people to insist their wrong interpretations of San Junipero are the only correct one when I gave the example. tialaramex 7 hours agorootparentprev> If the showrunners intended it to be unambiguously happy, I feel like they would have omitted that part... I think this has the same direct purpose as my favourite modern Doctor Who scene but with different larger strategy. To tell the audience something explicitly, because it's not necessarily obvious and otherwise not everybody will have guessed. Often the Doctor understands what's going on and the audience are learning as they go, but in \"The Girl In The Fireplace\" the Doctor never actually knows why this spaceship chose this girl, in this time. The audience does at the end though, because we pull out to show the spaceship's name. Both the women know exactly what we're shown at the end of San Junipero. That \"Heaven is a place on Earth\" in a very literal sense, but while it's explained somewhat, the details aren't mentioned because they'd be clunky as exposition - hence the explicit visualization of the data centre where they're running. You aren't alone in finding this horrifying, but for Charlie Brooker, myself and a large number of people this is the best case scenario - and since Charlie wrote the show... reply nojs 10 hours agorootparentprev> San Junipero, the one positive Black Mirror episode with an actual Happily Ever After romantic ending You forgot Hang the DJ :) reply pksebben 13 hours agorootparentprevOkay, yeah.

Apple can read approximately everyone’s iMessages out of their backups. It’s not private or secure, and claiming it is end to end encrypted is misleading almost to the point of being actually false. reply jackson1442 16 hours agorootparentThis is the same behavior as SMS if you have enabled “Messages backup.” If backup is not enabled you will not have a copy of iMessages stored in iCloud (though all compatible and configured devices will still receive messages). This can be changed by opting in to the e2ee iCloud data service “Advanced Data Protection.” reply sneak 15 hours agorootparentNope. Even opting into ADP, your iMessage conversations will still be backed up to Apple without e2ee - just from the non-ADP phones of all the people you iMessage with instead of your own phone. iMessages are backed up in duplicate - once on the sender and once on the receiver. You can only control e2ee for half of it, so your conversations are still under surveillance unless everyone you message with has also turned on ADP. reply Cyphase 8 hours agorootparentIs there any E2EE messaging service, or network protocol of any sort, that doesn't suffer from this?

I don't know if any of the clients store plaintext messages that would be backed up to Apple in a similar manner or not, but I'd hope at least the more security focused ones do not.

In reality an iMessage exploit is going to pay out a lot more because it would be exploitable on nearly all iPhones running x version of iOS, for example.

If we’re talking about having the microphone tapped etc, I don’t think anyone would still be developing 0-days for such old phones. If you want to be safer (assuming fear of old software having unpatched vulnerabilities) Nokia launched a dumb phone not too long ago. However… GSM networks and cell tower level tracking is much harder/almost impossible to escape short of throwing away your phone. SMSes can be hijacked, hostile agents can force downgrade the connection to 3G/2g to break encryption (iirc, please correct me if wrong), and your location is generally known to your service provider and Uncle Sam. Plus… the SIM card is its own mini computer, and lots of the firmware between that and the telephony modules is proprietary and closed source. If you’re familiar with intel ME you have an idea of what I’m talking about. Honestly, if you’re not a journalist going after big names, or a top CEO/president etc you likely don’t need to worry about any of these. But if you are, or just want to be privacy conscious, your best bet is to never use cell towers and only use Wi-Fi/internet from public or untraceable places; along with Wi-Fi calling for telephony.

Most of us publish a detailed target on our own back via LinkedIn, or our company's website About Us and Clients pages. Long ago, I co-founded a tiny startup. We had some high profile clients. I was dumb enough to put those clients on our site. I also used to be dumb enough to have a public social media profile, in my name. I was already somewhat security aware, but one day I almost fell for a spear phishing email. Someone created a gmail account 1 character different from my gf's gmail. They sent me a well worded, but simple email along the lines of \"Hey baby, check this out!\" and URL shortened link. She happened to be next to me, and I said to her \"Hey, what's this?\" \"What? I didn't send that!\" I then opened it in a VM and saw that it resolved to something.ru. It was a combo of identifying the juicy client of ours, seeing my name as co-founder, finding me on FB, finding my gf in my profile, getting her email, etc. I then got to learn fun new terms like threat modeling.

For example, economy class on all North American airlines is rather miserable, while most European non budget carriers have a better experience in economy. reply tombert 15 hours agorootparentI feel like, for better or worse, the US is sort of obsessed with figuring out how to drive costs down as low as possible, at least historically. So much early American industry was based around making mass-production more and more efficient, e.g. early assembly lines for the Ford company being an obvious case. In a lot of ways, this is obviously good, most people benefit from lower prices, more value being created, etc, but I think it's also made it so that cheap-but-ethically-dubious manufacturing from other countries becomes increasingly appealing, especially since it's abstracted enough from the end-user to where they can comfortably say \"out of site out of mind\". I'm no better; I know very well the conditions of some other countries, and think they're very bad. I also think it's bad that America fought a whole war to end slavery, and instead we just launder it through other countries. Still, despite me thinking all of this, I still generally shop for reasonable prices instead of trying to focus on ethical stuff. reply roody15 12 hours agorootparentprevCan confirm just got back from Barcelona on an Iberia flight. Evonomy on this flight was hands down better than any flight I have taken in the US. Food, service, even baggage policy was just simply a better experience. Honestly my mind was blown / food multiple meals included in price of economy seat. Just less nickel and diming and overall better experience, reply jayrot 12 hours agorootparentprevThe metal nametags is a very poor example of the point being attempted since I would venture a guess that there are 1000s of companies or shops in the US that can make metal nametags. reply Dalewyn 5 hours agorootparentI wholly admit it's a highly specific and probably poor example, but it helps to get my point across. Even US flags and US Olympic team uniforms were Made In China until there were rightful uproars to force the issue back to the homeland. When we can't make our own fucking blue jeans we absolutely cannot try for a technology victory. reply geodel 16 hours agorootparentprevWell you can also try committing to new year resolutions and so many other things. But companies have bet on consumers value convenience over everything else. And so far they've been right in almost every instance. reply loceng 17 hours agorootparentprevAs a bridge perhaps, and not all authoritarians are equal - of course, so being rational is fine - aligning with a less worse, less captured society is a reasonable stepping stone; and a maneuver can be to pit one tyrant against another, where India-China relations aren't good - however that could be useful to both tyrants towards manufacturing consent to send all of their young military aged men - who would be the strongest, most capable to go up against the tyrants - instead sending them to a meat grinder of a potential WW3 that the military industrial complex is also likely drooling over in their fascist wet dreams; the two sides of the fascist coin being authoritarian politicians and industrial complexes. However the longer we allow revenues to be generated in relationships with authoritarian economies-states, the more we're empowering them. That in a way is also a carrot - at least until a certain point of no return - where in America there's an effort to collapse the USD, and they might succeed - and then where BRICS will have buying power to influence the rest of the world to align with bad actors in each countries who aren't yet toeing the tyrannical line - and help them navigate towards a totalitarian state. Knowing who is your ally in each nation is important, and keeping communication lines open is the bare minimum - and tyrant wannabes in different nations, except in places like China where they already are locked down in their systems, still need to creep forward in as incognito method as possible until they've captured all of the various positions necessary before they can recruit and grow their Gestapo. Most people are unaware that Canada is about to be captured by fascists, and where laws and mandates have already passed that could allow those politicians to pretend they won the next election (multiple people in our intelligence agency CSIS already whistleblowing that China, the CCP is confirmed to have interfered in at least our last 2 elections which kept Trudeau-NDP in power) - and then pump that out and control the narratives in our state-funded media channels like CBC; mainstream news - including the biggest dissident media company called Rebel News - aren't shown on Facebook, for vector example, another vector being an arguably manufactured false flag 3-day outage of Rogers Telecommunications - where this fascist government immediately afterward mandated all telecommunications companies cross-integrate their services \"to act as a backup\" for other companies - which conveniently creates-allows for a centralized system for monitoring, etc. reply FpUser 16 hours agorootparent>\"where this fascist government...\" I am not sure whether this counts as the success or the failure of the meds reply mc32 17 hours agorootparentprevThere are definitely more countries where Intelligence Services spy on not only the opposition but members of congress. The FBI admitted to spying on members of the US senate as well as an adversarial candidate to the US presidency. reply everforward 17 hours agorootparentprevBest to refer to them as the “Ministry of Truth”. We’ve always been at war with Eurasia. I wonder if someone has made a “De-bullshitify English” Chrome add on to replace phrases like “mercenary hacker” and “officer-involved shooting” with more semantically correct phrases. reply FpUser 16 hours agorootparentprevSo you're saying that non authoritarian governments do not sponsor or do themselves the spying / attacks? reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 17 hours agoparentprevInteresting use of language on your part as well- what makes the NSO Group spyware illegal? reply nativeit 17 hours agorootparentAren’t its primary methods of deployment and utilization widely considered to violate domestic and international laws for unauthorized access to targets’ devices and/or data? I might be mistaken, I don’t know for sure how common such statutes are outside of the US, but I’m pretty sure it’s illegal in the United States, even for law enforcement (the likely unconstitutional extrajudicial activities of some unnamed alphabet agencies notwithstanding). If nothing else, there are documented cases where it’s been used to spy on journalists and activists in Saudi Arabia, including the widow of the assassinated American journalist Jamal Khashoggi. reply kmeisthax 3 hours agorootparentprevNSO Group is sanctioned, so buying their spyware is probably illegal if you're an American. Furthermore, several tech companies have sued or are in the process of suing NSO Group for their hacking operations. Expect those lawsuits to involve every HN user's two least favorite laws: DMCA 1201 and CFAA. reply ajross 17 hours agorootparentprevThe DMCA, in the US. Other statutes in other markets. Hacking computers is pretty prima facie criminal everywhere. It's true that there are inter-jurisdictional edge cases (cracking an iPhone in India via an attack from Israel probably isn't illegal in the USA,etc...) which allows NSO to operate more freely than we'd like. But no one seriously claims this is legal activity anywhere in particular, just that we can't catch them. Basically the distinction is one of law enforcement authority, not legality. reply PeterisP 12 hours agorootparentThe point I'm hearing in the parent post is more like that many of the state actors using such attacks against domestic targets actually may be legally allowed to do so, if they have passed laws which permit their own security services to use such software on their residents' phones. Even in USA that likely could be legal with an appropriate court warrant, and many other countries have more permissive constitutions. reply jayrot 12 hours agorootparent> Even in USA that likely could be legal with an appropriate court warrant Can you expand upon this? I'm not particularly familiar but it doesn't seem right. Obviously LEO agencies are allowed to subpoena private information, but can they legally use exploits with a warrant? Are there recorded examples of this? [Based on your reference to warrants, I guess I'm excluding the NSA or other supposed state-level spy agencies that supposedly secretively deploy such tactics] reply PeterisP 11 hours agorootparentI'm not a lawyer and the proper answer is likely state-dependent, but why not? It's well established that with an appropriate warrant, LEO have always been able to come into your house without telling you and add hidden surveillance bugs to listen on your communications; they have always been allowed to physically modify or replace your phone (e.g. physical phone wiretaps a century ago); Electronic Communications Privacy Act reasserts that this applies also to electronic surveillance and digital communications; so (as a non-expert) I don't really see why that wouldn't apply to smartphone exploits as well. We do see exploits being applied to devices in LEO possession (e.g. https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383957/fbi-san-bernadin... for one random example) to recover evidence. The main restriction is the constitutional limits of 4th amendment which requires specific warrants for each case - which is a significant practical obstacle, so the circumstances in which warrantless wiretapping is permitted (e.g. by PATRIOT act) is a contentious issue; however, it's not relevant if a proper warrant is obtained. reply kube-system 15 hours agorootparentprevThe CFAA is the broadest and most relevant US statute regarding computer hacking. But yes, international computer hackers typically operate outside of the jurisdictional reach of their targets. reply 1oooqooq 15 hours agorootparentprevironically, DMCA does. reply vngzs 17 hours agorootparentprevI would describe this spyware's \"illegal\" status as colloquially true - despite the lack of a comprehensive, international, enforceable legal framework - at least in the USA [0]: > As part of this effort, the End-User Review Committee of the BIS decided to add four foreign entities, among them two Israeli companies, NSO Group and Candiru, to the Entity List. The U.S. Export Administration Regulations (‘EAR’) impose additional license requirements for exports to listed entities, and limits the exceptions for exports, reexports, and transfers to such entities. But they continue: > The existing international and national frameworks regulating the export of sensitive spyware technologies lack the teeth necessary to deal with contemporary issues relating to the abuse of these technologies and the growing need for their enhanced supervision. [0]: https://www.law.georgetown.edu/ctbl/blog/managing-risky-busi... reply vinay_ys 15 hours agoparentprevWell, supreme court ordered panel investigation into this spyware scandal didn't find any evidence of actual spyware. So there's that. Also, if government wants to investigate someone, they have so many powerful ways to do that (and they actually do that). So, it's not clear to me what need they have to go spy on people via NSO tools. And surely, if they were building large datacenters to do massive spying like some TLAs do in 5eyes countries, we would know about it. So, no, this isn't the local government but a foreign government (which doesn't have detention powers in another country) that's likely to use remote hacking methods to coerce people in another country. We saw this with leaked data dumps from recent hacks by the not so friendly neighbors on India's many citizen databases (like retirement provident fund systems etc). reply mynameisvlad 14 hours agorootparentI'm not sure exactly what part of it you're trying to refute since your comment is kind of all over the place, but GP comment is correct. The reason it's called that is literally because of the Indian government. > Apple's removal of the term \"state-sponsored\" from its description of threat notifications comes after it repeatedly faced pressure from the Indian government on linking such breaches to state actors, said a source with direct knowledge. https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/apple-warns... reply vinay_ys 36 minutes agorootparentI'm clearly refuting this – \"because Modi complained\" in the GPs post. And your linked article is making an unsubstantiated claim based on \"source with direct knowledge\". That's just not credible enough. reply sigspec 17 hours agoprevPegasus and NSO. (Edit: of course I'm flagged for this. Surprise surprise) reply freedomben 17 hours agoparentI spend way too much time on HN, and having seen how often flags are abused or simply used too liberally, I think they are way too over powered. A lot of good discussion gets killed by flags right it of the gate. Sometimes it gets vouched and redeemed, but the vast majority of the time the damage is done and that comment or story languishes in obscurity. reply pvg 16 hours agorootparentThe comment doesn't really say anything and the commenter is not saying they edited the comment to make it just non-substantive rather than non-substantive and inflammatory. reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentExcellent point. Thank you! I would hope people aren't using flags for low-value comments, but you make a great point that it could have been edited to remove something that was deserving of a flag. reply pvg 16 hours agorootparentaren't using flags for low-value comments They could, and if you ask me, they should. They gum up threads and often start meta discussions about exactly how low-value they are. Many are even explicitly listed in the guidelines - snark, tropes and memes, 'broke the back button', shallow putdowns, etc. Righteously flaggable, one and all. reply freedomben 12 hours agorootparentI agree regarding snark, and pretty much anything that criticizes the person rather than the ideas. But one person's tropes and memes are often somebody else's current belief/position, especially if they are part of today's lucky 10,000[1]. What (in your opinion) is the purpose of the down-vote button? [1]: https://xkcd.com/1053/ reply pvg 12 hours agorootparentBut one person's tropes and memes are often somebody else's current belief/position In a site with the ostensible goal of 'curious conversation', that's not really good enough - it's not the job of your potential interlocutors to figure out what sincere, reasoned beliefs and positions hide behind the throwaway trope line. If you want to have a conversation, it's on you to try to converse. There are lots of other places where the trope line is fine - from the group chat with friends or colleagues to twitter. But those places work in different ways. What (in your opinion) is the purpose of the down-vote button? It's a way to say 'this comment is misranked'. There are lots of reasons to feel a comment is misranked - including simple disagreement. reply Kbelicius 16 hours agorootparentprevSaw it while it was flagged. There were two sentences.

This notification to users tells you nothing new. If something doesn't work, you move on to the next exploit available to you. It's not likely that they would shut shop and go away just because apple notified users. Only thing this does is Apple gets more users to turn on their protection mechanisms like lockdown mode which makes it more valuable to find vulnerabilities in that (as that is the new baseline now). And so goes the tale. It's a never ending escalatory game. reply FunkyFunTimes 16 hours agoprevHere’s hoping that this isn’t any sort of psychological warfare tactic which Apple has been pressurised to sow into making groups of people assume blame at certain groups for the purpose of swaying elections in certain ways. Because God knows how many times Five Eyes have tampered with elections across the Middle East in the past 50 years. I wouldn’t be naive to believe everything totally and just putting another perspective out there which may be worth considering (even for just a few seconds). reply Animats 15 hours agoprevThe message from Apple is so vague that it's useless. It just says to be afraid. There's no advice on what action to take. reply filenox 14 hours agoparentThat's not true, in the message they refer you to a web page with more details: About Apple threat notifications and protecting against mercenary spyware -https://support.apple.com/en-in/102174 reply swinglock 14 hours agoparentprevThe article omitted it, but the message says to update iOS to the latest software and enable its lockdown mode. reply Animats 13 hours agorootparentRight. That's a \"turn it off and turn it on again\" tech support answer. reply jayrot 12 hours agorootparentHardly.

A nation is a group of people sharing cultural, ethnic, and historical ties. There are many more nations than there are countries, especially within the US. A country has a political boundary, a flag and an anthem. It's one thing to use a word in the wrong way, because maybe you don't know the other word exists, and that's okay. But it's really annoying to hear both words being used in the same story but alternating them, without any explanation as to why. Is this an AI generated story? reply dragonwriter 17 hours agoparentPet peeve: Misguided pedantry Both “country” and “nation” have a wide variety of definitions, and several of them overlap. The definition you give for “nation” is a particular technical one used in certain contexts, but the word used for the way you define “country” in the context where that kind of technical definition is being used for “nation” is “state”, not “country”. (And even “state” may be used with additional qualifiers to disambiguate the exact sense when used for that, because it is a heavily-overloaded term.) reply gamepsys 16 hours agorootparentPet peeve: Not enough pedantry with language use in publications. Nation and country are not interchangeable. Words have meaning. Good journalist choose their words deliberately and have a deeper understand of language than the average person. reply mynameisvlad 14 hours agorootparentSure, words certainly have meaning, but that meaning is constantly evolving and even differs from person to person. For the common person and the common definition and use of the two words, they are very much interchangeable. The common person might not even notice the change in words because the generally used definitions of both are common enough. reply vineyardmike 17 hours agoparentprevWith all due respect, I’ve simply never heard anyone use these terms “correctly”. I live in an English-speaking country, and the closest thing I’ve seen to this is university signs that say things like “this is tiger nation” or something similar. But I’ve also seen people use “country” to express that too. I assume they’re alternating not because it’s AI written but because the author considered them synonymous and wanted it to sound less repetitive. These words are just so overloaded that I think this is a lost battle. People hike in the back-country, you can live in the city or the country. And frankly if you used “nation” to represent a cultural group of people in almost any context I think people would not understand or worse - assume you were stoking some racial angst or land-dispute. reply samatman 15 hours agoparentprevHence the name of the major intercountryal governing body, the United Countries. reply drcongo 17 hours agoparentprevIt's TechCrunch, pretty much the bottom of the barrel. reply hnfong 17 hours agoparentprev [–] I'm not sure this is true > There are many more nations than there are countries, especially within the US.

    "originBody": "Mental Health in Software Engineering 31 March 2024 · 31,892 views · Updated 12 April 2024 career development growth management newsletter startups Table of Contents I want to talk about something we don't discuss enough in our field: the mental health of software engineers, especially those of us who've taken on the challenge of leadership. As a technical co-founder, I've had my struggles with anxiety. It's something that comes with the territory but isn't part of the job description. If we rewind back to 2017, it was not a pleasant year for me — my days consisted of panic attacks, constant use of relaxing supplements, and trying to code while being severely under pressure with all the deadlines and new responsibilities. During that time, I inherited the position of Head of IT from my predecessor. I was now in charge of a small team of developers, and our startup has made many promises to many partners. It was my job to make it happen. I was either going to break or deliver. I did both. Mental health issues still carry a bit of stigma with them. You cannot take a sick day by telling your team, “I have mental issues and need a day off.” Not many people understand what panic attacks feel like and why would you need to take a day off because of them? I understand those people completely. Right until the moment I had my burnout (or a mental breakdown), I didn’t have any idea why you need to take drugs to manage your anxiety. I thought it was all in your head; can’t you control your thoughts? Apparently, sometimes, you can’t. Author: Sow Ay When I was first diagnosed with anxiety, I didn’t understand it, so I went to Reddit to read similar stories of people all around the world dealing with the same symptoms, trying to survive the same way I did. It calmed me down during panic episodes. Imagine sitting at your workplace, coding, and then a wave of primal fear running through you, an all-enveloping sense of doom starts consuming you, and you turn to Reddit to read stories about people experiencing the same things. That was my coping mechanism. And it worked. My story is, sadly, not unique. It’s a story that any software engineer can relate to. I was a perfectionist, a high-achiever who liked to have things under control and in a specific way to ensure everything was running as efficiently as possible. I have my keyboard bindings set up just as I need them, I have my dotfiles organized in a specific way, and I have my automation that makes my life easier. I think most software developers are like that. We strive to be efficient. It’s easy to have things under control when coding is the only thing that you do, for example, at the junior level. You have a clearly defined task, which your senior colleague refined based on some vague description that your product owner brought them. You debug it, have fun building things, get your next task, and solve some bugs. You have zero worries; your only job now is to get better and learn. Life is good. As you grow, you understand the realities of business. In business, there’s no place for perfection. There’s no space for having everything under control. In fact, not only can’t you influence most of the things around you, but most of the things are uncertain. Thinking about your next month becomes a math problem with probability variables. 🥸 An example of uncertainty in business is when your CEO tells you they promised a feature to your biggest client and it needs to be built ASAP as highest priority, so all hands on deck. Then a day later they tell you another feature, completely contradictory to the first one, needs to be built as well and is also highest priority. When you tell them they both can't be highest priority, the answer is: make it happen. This was my perfect storm in 2017 — I was trying to control all of the uncertainty around me: Trying to control the looming unrealistic deadlines. Writing a lot of the code myself to ensure we uphold our promises to stakeholders and none of our developers burn out. Which led to me working more and sleeping less. Worrying about next month’s payroll and trying to control our runway. Maintaining developer velocity and tight budgets, juggling future growth and current issues. Trying to control our developer turnover and making sure our juniors grow. There were days I'd be coding non-stop or in a series of back-to-back meetings, forgetting meals, sleeping, and even what it felt like to relax. There wasn’t one big thing that led to the burnout. It’s more of a combination of factors contributing to my perpetual state of stress. (Side note: I remember waking up on the weekends, feeling great the first few minutes in my bed, and then anxiety taking over). Eventually, I saw a doctor and am doing much better now. It took me a long while, though. Not all deadlines are equal I’m not going to philosophize about how you need to maintain a good work-life balance and how not doing so may negatively impact your non-job-related aspects of life. But I can tell you for a fact I did not have a good work-life balance before. I think I’m getting better, but it’s only due to the fact that my company is doing better — we have better cash flow, more loyal clients, and a great team. Before that? I thought work-life balance was a myth. I thought every deadline was sacred, every project was critical, and if you’re not online 24/7, it all fell apart. Was that true? It was, sometimes. 💡 Some people asked me — why are you working so much? What’s the worst that can happen? People not getting their salaries and the company going bankrupt. I think that’s a big enough reason to risk burning out. At least, I thought it was. Now? Probably still is a good reason, but I would approach it differently. This kind of situation isn't rare. You're always on edge, thinking the whole company's fate rests on your next move. It's like being in a constant state of alert, where slowing down feels like you're letting everyone down. As a CTO or any other tech leadership position, you're making calls that could either make or break the whole operation. And yeah, it's thrilling, but it's also a breeding ground for anxiety. This one time, for example, when our deployment crashed halfway through right before a major release. The CEO emphasized how important this project was, so we were all hands on deck, trying to get it back up, fearing the worst, that the client would go ballistic if he found out we were delaying the release. I was stressing big time, thinking we had to pull off a miracle, and of course we did. But you know what? After all that chaos, it turned out the relevant stakeholders were away on vacation that week, and the release wasn't even checked for many days after that. All that stress, the mad rush, and for what? We often stress ourselves over deadlines as if they're set in stone. But are they really? We push ourselves to the limit, thinking we're doing what's best for the business. What if we just… didn't? Not all deadlines are equal. That release could've waited. That deadline was one we could’ve let slip. Our health, our sanity, can't always take a backseat. Deadlines aren't created equal. Source: Monkeyuser.com In tech, there's this unspoken rule that you've gotta be all in, all the time. But that's just not sustainable. I've learned the hard way that not every deadline is do-or-die. Sometimes, pushing a release back a week is the best call you can make—for you and your team. What worked for me So, as you might guess, I’ve picked up a few tricks along the way that have seriously helped me out. I’m not going to tell you I’m an expert on mental health, and I’m not going to be giving out advice. I just thought I'd share the things that have helped me, just in case you find yourself in a similar boat. First off, anxiety and burnout are real, and they don't just go away on their own. I learned this the hard way. So, recognizing when you're starting to burn out or get anxious is crucial. For me, it was about noticing when I started to dread work I usually enjoyed and the random sense of apocalyptic doom or when my sleep went sideways. I mean, I don’t think anyone can miss those signs, but it took me half a year to recognize them and go to a psychotherapist. I thought I had the winter blues. Go figure… Saying “No” to anything non-critical in your off time, as well as setting boundaries between work and the rest of your life. I’m not very good at this yet, but I am learning to shut off after work hours. No reading emails, no \"quick checks\" on projects, no MacBook even. It's still challenging, but it’s getting better. Also, sometimes my partners call me on the weekends to do something; unless it’s something critical, I tell them I will handle it on Monday. Trust me, the world won't end if you tell someone you’ll do it 24 or 48 hours later. I hope this doesn't become the norm. Source: Todoist I swapped my coffee for decaf and cut out alcohol. It wasn't easy, but it helped me feel less jittery and sleep better. I also got into walking. I aim for 12,500 steps a day, usually with a podcast in my ears. It's my new (old) obsession. The steps clear my head and get me out of the work mindset. Plus, hitting my step goal feels like a win every day. Putting things in perspective has been another big one for me. I always ask myself, \"Will this matter in two years?\" You'd be surprised how often the answer is no. It takes the edge off the pressure. I allow myself to miss a deadline every now and then. As I mentioned above, not every deadline is do-or-die. Sometimes, it’s entirely reasonable to push things back to worry less.  Notifications on my phone? Almost all gone. If something's truly urgent, it'll find its way to me. This alone has cut down on a lot of unnecessary stress. It's like I've reclaimed my attention span. I don’t get constant DING! DING! But here's something I didn't expect to have such a big impact: educating myself on mental health and emotional intelligence. Understanding that someone might be fighting a battle I know nothing about made me a more empathetic leader and colleague. It's changed how I interact with my team. I've learned to listen more, assume less, and approach every situation with a bit more kindness and understanding. You never know when a little compassion during those stressful times will help someone avoid burnout. When I felt overwhelmed, I didn’t immediately seek professional help. I thought I could handle it myself; I was ashamed of going to a psychotherapist, as if my seeking help was admitting that I was broken. Since then, I’ve understood many things. First of all, it’s totally fine to be vulnerable. If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to seek professional help. We’re all human. There's no shame in it. In fact, it's one of the bravest things you can do. We go to the doctor for a physical ailment; why should our mental health be any different? In short, for me, it's been about making small, sustainable changes and being kinder to myself. It's not always easy, and I'm still learning, but these steps have helped me find a healthier balance. Our greatest asset You've heard it before, but let me repeat it — our greatest asset isn't the code we write. It's us. Our health, our minds, our ability to be present and enjoy life outside of the terminal window. Software Engineers and Tech co-founders, like us, are more prone to hitting the lows. Depression doesn't care about your GitHub stars or how scalable you managed to build your Kubernetes Cluster. I've learned the hard way that not every problem at work is mine to solve. I used to take every customer issue personally, letting my stress levels hit the roof. But I've gotten better at recognizing what's within my control and what's not. Can't help a customer because of a time difference or because it's outside my expertise? That's okay. There's a team for that, and it's not all on me. I’ve been burnt out and stressed out, and it took a toll on my work, my relationships, everything. Only after I finally started prioritizing my well-being did things change for the better. I won’t say it’s all rainbows and ponies now, but things have changed. I became a better engineer, a better leader, a better friend, and a happier person than I was. If you’ve read this far — know that you’re not alone. Things do get better. If you're overwhelmed, ask for help; there’s no shame. Find what makes you tick outside of work — be it with your family, a new hobby, or just chilling with your pets — and give it the time it deserves. Any company that measures your worth by how quickly you burn out isn't worth your time or talent. So, I will repeat it again: our greatest asset isn't the code we write. It’s us, alive, and living the life. UPDATE April 2024: If you prefer watching videos rather than reading, or if you just want to see my face — I recorded a video version of this article.

Reply Anonymous April 1, 2024 at 3:36 pm Thanks for the article. For me, the turning point wasn’t just talking about stress and understanding that I burned out. It was when I started treating my job like a job, not my whole life. I used to wrap my identity around my work. If the code was bad, I was bad. If there was a mistake — it was my personal fault.That mindset was toxic. In my case what helped — I picked up hobbies that had nothing to do with tech. Started baking. You can’t rush a loaf of bread; it takes time, patience. It taught me there’s a rhythm to life outside the constant push of updates and deadlines. Also, I stopped glorifying the grind. I work my hours, do my best, then log off. My laptop closes, and so does my workday. My world doesn’t end if I’m not coding after hours. Life’s too short to spend it all staring at a screen. So, yeah, thanks for sparking the convo. Just wanted to share my two cents.

The business isn't going to fail if you slip a week, or frequently even six months and if it does its probably not the fault of engineering unless its so dysfunctional as to repeatably blow through its own delivery estimates. Sure there are regulatory deadlines, customer POC or delivery deadlines. But, truly hard deadlines won't pop up as \"we need this done next week\" unless there is something fundamentally wrong with the business/sales side. A good functioning engineering/business unit will know far in advance of those kinds of deadlines and it becomes a question of whether the existing engineering org is capable of delivering the functionality within a heavily padded schedule. Put another way, I don't think i've ever seen a customer walk from a product because it wasn't released on a cadence, in fact many aren't actually happy about upgrades unless they are fixing a problem they have requested. And sales/POC cycles are such that frequently the customer may not actually have an alternative solution, or if they do, the chances they will switch to your product simply because you have X this year instead of next year isn't something that hinges on small factors that can be done by the engineering team in short cycles. You win because the product is better/etc and that doesn't happen overnight. So, stressing and working endless 80 hour weeks likely is going to have the opposite effect and creates a low quality product that people are trying to get rid of because it keeps breaking. reply makk 9 hours agoparent> most deadlines were entirely arbitrary Yes. As are most tasks, in my experience. Looking back on your almost 30 years, what percent of tasks could have been skipped entirely and, in the long run, it wouldn't have mattered? For me, it's easily >50% ... catch me on a grumpy day and I'd say it's closer to 90%. reply gavmor 6 hours agorootparentSure, but that inertia carries you over the myriad alignment traps strewn like potholes over the face of your production–possibility frontier. reply MichaelZuo 5 hours agorootparentIf anything that's overstating the prospects of the median person in software engineering. Probably even the 99th percentile HN user couldn't do anything lasting and noteworthy if they somehow were blocked from relying on inertia, sheer dumb luck, obscure chains of fortuitous happenstance, etc... e.g. probably no one reading this can even hold the full Bluetooth spec in their head and understand all the tricks and pitfalls and obscure corner cases. Let alone do any useful work based on that. For the vast vast majority, progress happens in the form of millions of monkeys bashing typewriters in the hopes of getting a gem. reply cmrdporcupine 9 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, most companies and projects fail completely. In my 25ish year career I can only think of a handful of lines of code that I've written that are still in production (or that I think might still be in production) and only a few employers that still exist. When you pan out far enough it all seems a bit silly. reply strken 7 hours agorootparentI think this is confusing code with output. If you work for a company that builds medical software, then your output is something like quality-adjusted life years for patients and has nothing to do with the code you incidentally use to get there. Taking the view that none of the software you wrote is still running is a bit like an automotive engineer who thinks none of the car models she worked on at the start of her career are still in production.

Does an electrical engineer not smile when they drive by a substation they helped design? Does a teacher not remember their most successful students? Does a parent not remember their children? Why would a software developer not want to know how long their projects lasted? Why would they not measure their impact in terms of messages sent, or mean-time-between-failure, or ROI / cost-to-benefit ratio, or smiles-per-hour? I'm not saying every line of code I write was one I was proud of, but I have dug into thorny problems, crafted solutions that were good enough, and been happy to see the code stay in service with only a very light touch needed to keep it on track. Of that, I am proud. reply teaearlgraycold 8 hours agorootparentprevDepends where you work. Code I wrote for the government may live on for far too long… reply nox101 9 hours agoparentprevIt depends on the industry. Video games are still sold at retails stores (Target, Best Buy, ...). Those stores have to coordinate what is going to be on their shelves months in advance (6+)? So you promise your game will be ready and in a package and at their loading dock by November 15th. If you miss the deadline their shelf is empty of product since its spot was reserved for you. Other customer electronics have similar issues. Promises are made to coordinate. They're generally made before the product is actually finished. Now a deadline exists. It's not trivial to change it. The same is true for ads or was (TV ads in particular). They have to be scheduled well in advance. You pay for ads to run 6 months in advance because if you don't buy them in advance all the time slots will be sold out, no ads for you. But now you've added a deadline. If your product is not ready to buy when the ads run you've just wasted a bunch of money. I agree that for many standard IT projects, deadlines can be kind of BS but I can also see why they tend to exist in retail products. A solution could be, don't even start negotiating for shelf space before the product is 100% finished. Unfortunately few if any companies seem to be able to do this. For one, they need the money from the orders to make payroll. For another, if they waited until the product is done, then order ads and shelf space which won't be available for 6 months, what do they're employees do during those 6 months? They have no customers to fix bugs for yet. If the switch off the product to the next product there will be a big cost to pay to try to switch back the previous product they stopped working on 6 months previously when it actually ships and they need to actually support it. reply krimskrams 8 hours agorootparentWhat do you think about the other side of the video game industry where games are distributed digitally? Most PC games nowadays are distributed this way and even consoles are moving in this direction too. There is so much more to it than just aligning marketing and distribution with the development cycle. Time and time again, news breaks out about terrible working conditions and crunch culture being so ingrained and standard in this industry. Many cases come from studios that mainly distribute their games digitally. So many AAA titles nowadays are released half-finished, broken and rushed for the sake of meeting next quarter's quotas at the expense of the company's employees mental health (Ubisoft for instance), and in some cases, their lives (Activision Blizzard). The fact that some developers are unjustly taking heat, blame and pressure from their own playerbase is not the saddest part. Video game journalists are disincentivised from talking about it from fear of being blacklisted. I find that looking at it from the traditional brick-and-mortar perspective misses a dark side of this industry that is often entirely ignored, or treated as an open secret. Crunch can be avoided. Nintendo and Mojang have delayed releases to avoid crunch, yet one of the two also deals with physical retail copies. This is a management/investor pressure/culture/people issue. reply shultays 11 minutes agorootparentFor video games there are also holiday seasons that you may not want to miss. So even if you are using digital stores, there are deadlines that might matter reply filleduchaos 7 hours agorootparentprev> What do you think about the other side of the video game industry where games are distributed digitally? As someone that has done work for indie studios, you very much still have to align marketing and distribution with the development cycle with online marketplaces. Shelf-space and shelf-life aren't any less real because they are virtual - if anything, they're scarcer resources. Anyone who's actually sold things online can attest to this; customers' patience and attention spans are horrendously short. Not making it into the first page of results can be a straight-up death sentence for a project. reply throwaway5959 7 hours agorootparentprevI know this was just an example, but in the case of video game sales, they’re all going to be digital in the next console generation (if not, in the one after that). Then all of that retail space will be reclaimed for other purposes. reply earthling8118 9 hours agorootparentprevYou dismiss that these are arbitrary, but I'm not seeing a whole lot in your examples that aren't also arbitrary. Sure, this is how a lot, if not all, companies work. That does nothing to disprove that this is arbitrary at the cost of mental health. reply elevatedastalt 8 hours agorootparentWhat is your point? We are not isolates who just subsist by ourselves. The modern world is a massively complex interconnected and interdependent system and we rely on the glue of capitalism to ensure that everyone still looks out for themselves but makes it all work for the system. Were the massive chip shortages causing a massive reduction in car availability and increase in prices \"arbitrary\"? Was the Suez canal blockage causing weeks of shipping delays \"arbitrary\"? If companies promise to pay for a stall at the next expo, but then don't actually make it because they don't ship their products in time, and now the expo loses revenue because they can't fill the stall at the last moment, is that also \"arbitrary\"? reply willcipriano 4 hours agorootparentprev> months in advance Finish it, then 6 months later you release. reply iamflimflam1 1 hour agoparentprevBusinesses aren’t that bothered about deadlines - provided they have sufficient notice that a deadline is going to be missed. What frustrates business is when there is no warning and engineering suddenly announces out of the blue that an imminent deadline can’t be hit. Or even worse, the constant drip of, it’s almost done - just one more sprint… The knee jerk current reaction of “we’re just not going to do estimates anymore” and “it’s done when it’s done” really don’t help in any way. reply makeitdouble 6 hours agoparentprev> I came to the conclusion years ago that most deadlines were entirely arbitrary. To add to this, many manager/leaders assume some kind of deadline is needed for every tasks. They themselves manage their schedule by timeboxing and setting arbitrary due dates, feel extremely productive doing so, and expand that insight to the whole business. The base assumption is a task won't be done in a timely manner if there isn't a threat with a time limit on it. On a human level, I also understand the appeal of having a set date for something to be done: there's a warm and fuzzy feeling of a well oiled machine churning stuff on a predictable schedule. But it's just cruel to subject so many people to a forced schedule just to manage someone's anxiety and scheduling OCD. Reality is complex, longing for making it fit into neet boxes is delusional and unproductive. reply redrove 3 hours agorootparentAs an engineer I agree, but I’ve had the misfortune of managing poorly performing teams composed of unfit individuals that I couldn’t get rid of and they would do absolutely nothing if I didn’t arbitrarily give them some deadlines at least now and then. It goes both ways. reply makeitdouble 2 hours agorootparentI hear you. I see those more as checkpoints than deadlines though. Even with highly self managing people, it's always safer to have some idea of how much time it could take, and check for some kind of status midway to know if it's too different from the rough estimate (sometimes you learn they didn't touch the task for various reasons) reply chollida1 14 hours agoprevI'm not terribly convinced that software engineering is harder on someone mental health than being a doctor, lawyer, sales, engineer, professional athlete, teacher, or any other white collar profession is. All of these have their specific stressors, all of these professions have loads of articles about how people are leaving these professions due to how hard they are. All of these jobs tend to lead to them consuming your free time if you don't set boundaries, all have deadlines that lead to stress. >You cannot take a sick day by telling your team, “I have mental issues and need a day off.” This hurt me to read on behalf of the OP.

Our mental health experts want to keep people working because having them sit at home drinking/gaming does nothing. I have seen kids actually react well to increased \"stress\" on the job. Think basic training stuff. They are worked hard, go home tired and then actually sleep. Sending them home not tired leads to drinking and late-night gaming sessions after which they do not sleep and come to work the next day like zombies. Our people know how to spot this and adapt their schedules specifically to break the cycle. It wouldn't work for everyone, but we do need to accept that we are each not necessarily our own best therapists. If given more time off, many of us will simply amplify negative behaviors.

You're saturating their day so that they're distracted from whatever underlying problems they face. They're too tired to deal with them so they sleep and repeat. I'd be curious to see your solution play out in the ten years post separation, but the VA may be ahead of you. For context (if you're not American) TAPS is what you take as you separate: https://benefits.va.gov/TRANSITION/docs/pstap-assessment.pdf (Section 4.C should have some relevant quotes). I remember at some point a Navy Corpsman explaining to me that the goal of Navy medicine isn't to make you better, it's to keep you in fighting shape. Fighting shape doesn't need to be the best or most optimal shape, just enough to do the job the military needs you to do. reply coffeemug 10 hours agorootparentPeople use all kinds of colloquial models for mental health that may or may not have a relationship with reality. It is not obvious to me that there is such a thing as \"underlying problems\" that you mask by doing something else. Maybe, maybe not-- mental health is complicated and you have to prove this stuff. An alternative model is that people get depressed when they do nothing at home, and get better when they're surrounded by other people and have tasks to complete. I don't know what's actually right, but I'm always very skeptical when people approach these things with certitude. reply oooyay 10 hours agorootparentI was speaking from some lived experience, so I'll be a bit more clear about what I meant by \"underlying problems\": There were little activities to do on my base other than drink. I was paid very little, little enough not to afford a car. The cities I was stationed in were sounded by all kinds of loan sharks as a result. There were very few activities funded by the military that weren't somehow childlike or oriented for people with families. I was forced to live in a very old barracks that at times, frankly, barely functioned. While living in the barracks you can be summoned for duty at any time, unlike people who live off-base (married people). My life was as a Marine, so I'd be curious to hear an Airman's perspective. The services also tend to attract people who are actively attempting to leave home, so read from that what you will. None of these things are really unknown to the military or military leaders. reply sandworm101 10 hours agorootparentprevWith young people it isn't a matter of running them tired and bypassing the problem. Most aren't actually mentally ill, rather for the first time in their lives they don't have someone telling them how to live their lives on a daily basis. So they are given structure until they can work that stuff out for themselves. Extra work is often part of that structure. For instance, I know of one 19yo who was basically bored to death at work and hitting the bar every night (not in the US). So his boss put him on the unit \"safety committee\", which is extra work. He then had to interview people and write a monthly report to be read by the CO, which is very scary for the average 19yo kid at his first unit. That little bit of responsibility, extra work, turned him around real fast. He came to my office to have me edit his first report. He was nervous, but prideful nervous rather than scared. He didn't have bags under his eyes anymore. reply oooyay 10 hours agorootparentI get what you're saying now. People do need billets to bridge them to some more higher official responsibility if you want them to grow. That said, I don't think this is a great panacea for mental health days. Generally I use mental health days if I'm overly stressed, burned out, upset, etc... Would you let a troop take a sick day if they were any of those things? reply sandworm101 10 hours agorootparentActually no. We have a procedure. Such people would be reminded of the various mental health services we have. If they don't touch base themselves, someone will touch base with them. That might be a padre or more likely a call from a mental health nurse. Those people would then authorize them staying home, or not, based on medical judgement. We don't allow people to switch off, especially when they might have access to weapons. If you call in for a mental health day, and then don't answer the call from the padre/nurse/boss, you can expect people at your door within an hour. I know of one door physically broken down after a kid called in for a mental health day, then fell asleep (very likely still drunk) and failed to answer the door. reply earthling8118 9 hours agorootparentQuite frankly, this is why I'm glad to no longer be part of such an organization.

After a stressful day as a software engineer or other white collar job, your body is not tired. Mentally you might be tired but that just leads to doomscrolling and social media and other dopamine hits. The key point here is that one should ideally be physically tired so that after they go home they want to sleep. This is why, for example, after a stressful day I make my body tired with a long run. reply nsguy 12 hours agorootparentprevYou go home from the military during basic training? Curious what country that is... Having served I agree that a military environment where your day is full and you're basically told what to do all the time, and you're maybe working extremely hard, can override some \"bad thoughts\". That said, it's not unheard of for soldiers to commit suicide, harm themselves or others, and generally suffer from stress related to the military environment. I agree that simply taking a day off is not a fix and if you are worried about getting stuff done at work it might even make things worse. That said, being in a workplace where it's considered ok to take a day off if you need to, maybe go hiking or something, is probably something that alleviates stress from the employees. reply sandworm101 10 hours agorootparent>> Think basic training stuff. Basic training is a nothing thing in the military. It does not represent what military life is like. It is just a temporary proving ground for new employees. That said, many units still do unit PT in the afternoons specifically so that people head home reasonably tired. Remember too that in the military, especially for young single people, \"home\" is wherever you rack out. reply boogieknite 10 hours agorootparentprevI've seen what you describe but then also can speak for myself that on my time off I'm awfully active. Building things physical and/or software, spending time outside, reading, etc. If I retired tomorrow I'd probably work just as much, if not more, because I'd work on my interests and not what I was assigned. This is common for the majority of adults I know. I'd say I'm far from fully burnt out (we've all had our moments) but I think there is some career saturation point where people feel ownership over their free time and treat it with respect instead of \"drinking/gaming\". Is wasting days off a symptom of youth? Is it because military employees lack autonomy? Is it just natural after years of selling your time to an employer? reply ToucanLoucan 12 hours agorootparentprevIt varies from person to person, but speaking for myself, getting back to work is incredibly good for me after I've experienced something terrible. The structure, the feeling of \"normal,\" is better therapy than many give it credit for. Now granted, a big part of that is because I thoroughly enjoy my work and my manager looks out for my well-being, as do I for my subordinates. I know plenty of people, friends and family, who loathe their return to work precisely because that's not the case for them. As to the GP's question: > Has any company come out against mental health in the past 20 years? Certainly not, but there are innumerable companies, software and otherwise, that while paying useless lipservice to the concept of taking care of employees, absolutely do not follow through. I have one friend who's simply unable to attend therapy because his insurance is shit and he's in too much debt to take on another. His employer has all kinds of things to say about how much they take care of their own, but he gets shit from his manager for taking \"mental health days\" so he doesn't, he just says he has the flu. Mind you he's no burger flipper, he's a seasoned sysadmin. And, lest we forget that outside our IT professions, it's even worse.

There is still a lot of social stigma around mental health issues. Your boss doesn't need to know why you are sick.

Now add in patients and their families having the worst days of their lives in your presence day after day, high-pressure decision making, not getting even the chance to sit or go to the bathroom for nearly a whole shift. To top it off, if you have an \"off day\", that can earn you a lengthy investigation +/- a court case. While it may sound insensitive, software engineering is nowhere near as complex or stressful as many (but not all) medical roles. It is both mentally and physically less taxing. reply riehwvfbk 11 hours agorootparentAnd at the end of the day this is exactly the attitude that prevents people from asking for a day off. It's wrong in medicine and it's wrong here. The attitude we should have is: yes, Mr. Successful Boss Man, you are a better human than me: you are more disciplined, don't have a problem with anxiety while dealing with a lot more stress, make more money and even look better. But these facts do absolutely nothing to change that I am crumbling and need a break. If you are so good at dealing with stress - write the software (or stitch up that patient) yourself, surely it would be easy for you, the superhuman? But we won't do that. Instead we'll pretend we are 10x engineers or genius doctors until we either mess ourselves up, or make a big enough mistake.

They actually couldn't have their successful business empire or their big fancy hospital without our work. reply Zenzero 9 hours agorootparentYou should always be advocating for better hours and more of the rewards from your work. I support that. What makes me take it less seriously is framing it as a crisis in mental health. As much as people don't like comparisons the marketplace for our labor is inherently comparative, and people will optimize for the most money with the least hours/stress. I get that I'm providing anecdata but like I've said in previous comments, the stuff that software engineers I know complain about is from a much more privileged position than other occupations. Burnout is real, but if your version of burnout is someone else's idea of a mildly challenging day (which is my experience) it doesn't have the impact you want it to have. You may not realize it but there are roles in medicine where the work itself is inherently stressful regardless of how many concessions your employer provides. If your goal is to argue that software engineers deserve higher compensation and better hours and more autonomy given the value they provide, it would garner more sympathy from someone like me.

Most doctors are not spending solid 4hr blocks in flow focusing on a highly complex problem (surgeons being the obvious exception) but instead dealing with a sort of multi-tasking complexity which is a completely different type of mental taxation. reply Zenzero 6 hours agorootparent> Most doctors are not spending solid 4hr blocks in flow focusing on a highly complex problem I'm sorry but this is exactly what I meant by my original post. You don't realize that 4hr blocks in flow is an enviable luxury. Granted my time was in a high acuity setting but let me cast it in more relatable terms. Software 1 is brought to you with a complaint of the billing system dropping occasional transactions over the last 4 months. Now it is dropping 1 in 100 transactions. They use the Stripe API. It's your job in the next 15 minutes to debug and determine if there will be a complete service outage occurring within the next couple hours. If there will be an outage, you are expected to push a temporary fix to prod immediately and refer for continued review. If not, you must determine which parts of the billing system require referral for revision. Mind you that every decision you make can be reviewed years after the fact and can be litigated as they please. Your assistsnt comes over with softwares 2 through 5 that were just submitted for your review. Software 2 has issues with a simple deadlock that could have been handled by someone other than you, but now it's your problem to deal with. Software 5 has been inexplicably ported from Delphi to Angular, and they've seen 2 others before you about why some of their native functionality broke, but now it's a big problem and they need you to look at it. There were some patches made by other devs but the stakeholders don't have access to them right now. As you are looking into software 4,the assistant tells you \"Dr zenzero, devops is on line 1 for you\". They tell you that software 1 has more problems than described and it looks like it needs to be refactored in multiple areas. Software 3 keeps complaining to your assistant that you're ignoring them. So no, \"Most doctors are not spending solid 4hr blocks in flow focusing on a highly complex problem\" because they don't get that luxury. I get to do that now and it's bliss. reply filleduchaos 7 hours agorootparentprevI mean, most doctors are spending their entire shifts trying not to inadvertently kill or disable anyone. Yeah that's a completely different type of mental taxation - one far worse IMO than any highly complex problem I've ever encountered in software engineering (and quite frankly, the problems aren't that complex most of the time. If anything, personally the SE stuff that's actually hard is fun and the rest is rather mind-numbing). reply zeroonetwothree 6 hours agorootparentprevThere’s a certain type of person that always has to comment whenever anyone says they have it hard by pointing out how actually those problems are nothing compared to X.

Further, you are also making the mistake of invalidating other people's individual experiences based on your perception of what the average worker does. In other words, it is trivially easy to find software engineers who are burnt out to a much nicer crisp than the average doctor, and your dismissal of their suffering won't change a thing for them. This isn't a contest to see which profession is most toxic to its workers. Our aim should be to find ways to prevent and mitigate these situations. reply Zenzero 10 hours agorootparentI hear what you're saying, but I don't feel I said it was universal in the sense that you're describing it. On the whole I would rate the average software engineer as having a less stressful life than the average doctor. I acknowledge that there are outliers and individual experiences that go against the average. That said, I would argue that you underestimate the number of people in medicine who are burnt out. Many of my colleagues stay because it is a sunk cost financially/time-wise/reputatationally. You can pull up the numerous studies on burnout rates that have been done. I'd anything it affirms my statement that you don't realize how much worse it could be. Like I said, there's a difference between taking down prod for 6 hours and getting sued for accusations that you killed a living being.

The pressure in software engineering is something entirely different, and far worse, than what I experienced in the legal environment. By and large lawyers are lawyers, not managers. Yes, there's a hierarchy of junior associate to senior-most partner but it's lawyers all the way up and down the chain. You don't have lawyers working under managers. And there's something about this that makes the pressures different. Pressures are there, hours are long, spouses are unhappy because the lawyers are always at work or distracted at home... but I never had anxiety attacks or mental health issues working in the legal environment whereas in the software and startup environments I did. In legal, everyone knows the drill and you do the drill. And your superiors have done the drill. In software, you often don't know drill.

How many mainstream software companies are contributing to building a society that you yourself would like to live in? To put it bluntly, many bad parents abandoned their kids to the internet where they found solace. Software engineering is a natural extension of spending too much time using the internet and becoming curious how it works. Poor mental health is a function of unmet needs... not feeling attractive, not feeling like you are contributing to the world or society at large, not getting laid, not feeling loved, not feeling worthy of love.

Lawyers have been widely (and unfairly!) regarded as one of the most despised professions since Shakespeare.[0] Professional atheletes have long been subject of the media debate over being paid \"too much\" compared to the value they bring to society.

Software engineering is a natural extension of spending too much time using the internet and becoming curious how it works. This is becoming less and less true.

This is classical division of worker / manager in the Taylorist sense, as in the managers are mostly not developers themselves. This is what makes software developers a low status profession, i.e. many developers are glorified assembly line workers with little agency over their work (they do not make decisions). Doctors and lawyers might have some form of management layer, but this is mostly a support function. reply jjav 8 hours agorootparentprev> Software engineering is not a low-status position Pay is not status. Software currently pays quite well, but in most companies today a developer is at the very bottom of the status curve. Developers are no longer allowed any say in what to build or how to build it, they are micromanaged by product managers and program managers and team managers and required to give daily status reports (\"agile\"). (I say \"used to\" because in the 90s developers were a high status role. You got to make all decisions and execute on them with great independence. Pay was much lower but respect was much higher.) The other stress factor is that developers get decreasing respect every year they age. This is in contrast with basically every other professional role where experience is highly valued. Nobody wants the rookie heart surgeon, everyone wants the 60 year old who has done it thousands of times.

I don't see how this is a bad thing, for a large and complicated product. For a small company where a team of 5 people can do the whole thing, sure, you don't need all this management, though I think some parts of the Agile methodology can be useful just for keeping people in sync. I worked in a small-ish team a while ago using an Agile methodology and it was fine: the program manager basically told us the feedback from the customer, and then it was up to us to decide what features to make to keep the customer happy and how to do it and how to schedule it. The Agile methodology just forced us to have regular meetings, and made it easy for the outside stakeholders to keep tabs on us and attend our meetings when necessary. Having daily habits in your life isn't a bad thing for many people, and that's basically what Agile was, in my experience: a way of having habits. >Pay was much lower but respect was much higher. No, it really wasn't. Maybe within the profession, but not to society at-large. Developers back then had little respect, until they started making lots of money in the dot-com boom, then people starting respecting the profession a bit more. Software development has never gotten the respect that doctors and lawyers get. >Nobody wants the rookie heart surgeon, everyone wants the 60 year old who has done it thousands of times. This might have some truth, but it's a bad view: generally, older surgeons prefer to use older surgical techniques that they learned decades ago, since they weren't trained on the newest techniques. The newer techniques generally are much less invasive and have faster recovery times. It's better to go with younger surgeons who have more modern training, but still some experience (i.e., not fresh out). reply p_l 11 hours agorootparentprev> This is just your perspective and, IMO, it's pretty warped.

I find that it definitely points to a time period when someone entered maybe not workforce, but the \"IT world\" let's say. There was a time when programming in many places had definitely \"unsexy\" vibe among general population, with a lot of, well, painful \"jokes\", and all of that definitely set a \"theme\". fast forward a decade or so to 2010 and suddenly IT is no longer that place where only losers go. reply optimalquiet 9 hours agorootparentAs it turns out, the massive money generated by software produces quite a lot of status. But the IT world is meaningfully different from software engineering. IT infrastructure (as distinct from creating software) pays less, generally, and is also regarded as much lower-status. IT is like auto mechanics to software engineering's automobile design. It's the blue collar equivalent, especially at the low level. At the high level, as far as I understand, it morphs with \"cloud-engineering\" or just general management and becomes higher-status. Unfortunately, I think this comes from how the entrance into IT is gated by working on low-level (\"have you tried turning it off and on again?\") problems, and putting slightly awkward, new-to-the-workforce nerds in a position where they need to help a lot of people with their computer problems. Many of whom are (understandably!) frustrated that their computer systems aren't working and/or don't totally understand why they won't work. So IT gets to see people at their worst and most frustrated, and people get to see IT at its most awkward and least experienced. So hostility forms on both sides.

They both suck, but for completely different reasons. GE actually had real business units. Energy, aerospace, consumer, industrial, healthcare, you name it, they had a presence. Welch couldn't squeeze enough money to meet Wall Street's expectations out of these units, and didn't innovate when microcomputers were coming onto the scene in the 90s, so he cannibalized the company to boost share price at the expense of the business being able to continue long-term. Of course, he would be dead by then. The guys in the valley are the opposite because many of them don't actually have a product, or even business, to sell - or they do, and the product itself is realizing it doesn't want to be sold. We've had social media and ad-based online services for 20+ years now and it's generally seen as a net negative for society. The subscription-based business model wouldn't work for most social media companies as it would limit the network effect and thus the TAM of the company's business. They're having to find more and more creative ways to monetize eyeballs when the eyeballs don't want to be monetized anymore. Then you have the people who are swapping out their FLOSS licenses for proprietary ones on software offerings (looking at you Redis) because they realize if you just give stuff away for free, there is no monetization route, and dammit, they want - nay, deserve - their massive payday like the Steves and Bill and Larry got. TL;DR Jack had a lot to sell at the expense of GE as a long-term going concern; SV has nothing to sell but wants to be a long-term going concern. reply __loam 5 hours agorootparentYeah I do mean the same Jack Welch who looted GE and permanently sent American business culture into a seemingly unrecoverable decline. Maybe GE was just way too unfocused of a company to exist, but if you squint enough, you can see the trail of shit leading from his leadership at GE to places like Boeing and now Google, where employees are discarded even when you're making billions in profit every quarter and you have a near monopoly on your industry.

In the meantime, enthusiastic kids provide a relatively cheap, manipulable, supply of powerpoints and pizazz -- whereas sober, mature professionals often need more personal income and tend to focus more on executing the business that they have experience in (mostly irrelevant to the VC's own business) instead of matching the investment pitch for upcoming rounds (all that matters). reply hnfong 15 hours agorootparentprevThe VC investors don't need a startup that accurately predicts its odds, because most startups fail.

I think one key tricky part is that -- even if the 25yo starts with being all-around smart, and unusually aware&humble, yet nevertheless tackling something big -- is that it's very hard to know when they should listen to team/advisors (and which), vs. when they should do a contrary thing that they think is the smart thing. Maybe that's doable well enough, if they have all those good qualities, and happen to be exposed to a good team/advisors. (Side note: It doesn't help that various facets of the fields are filled with bad practices/advice, as well as outright intentional deception and manipulation. If you read PG's essays early on, that was a time when you might expect a fellow techie and businessperson to have smart and well-intentioned advice, wanting you to succeed. That's absolutely not the norm anymore: you're much more likely to get bad advice today, no matter where you look, and more likely to encounter individuals and institutions trying to manipulate you. Even when you can filter that out first-hand, you're still getting a lot of it second-hand, through their influences on smart&decent people who you do let influence you.) reply digging 10 hours agorootparent> I suspect that there's no good reason that a 25 year-old can't be a great startup CEO. There's exactly one: Learning takes time. The smartest, kindest, most level-headed 25 y/o is not going to be as good a leader as their 35 y/o self, assuming they continue to build on their leadership skills. Now we could say, well, maybe those 25 year-old CEOs overwhelmingly exhibit degraded leadership skills by the time they're 35. That's a statistic that's possible. But I think it would point toward some seriously prevalent burnout, not an inherent benefit of being 25. It may be easier to be positive at 25, but I don't think the ceiling for positivity is higher at 25 than at 35. reply grvdrm 13 hours agoparentprevLet me add: you never need to be in awe of someone who treats anyone else like garbage - whether they are 20 or 60.

No disrespect to those who are just there to take care of their family, but they are of a different breed. Programming is in a weird place where it's literally brand new in terms of the scale of human history and yet already \"established\" as an industry. Most of the engineers that I look up to and respect are the ones that will be coding from a wet cardboard box should it come to that, but darn it the code will be pushed to main no matter what. That's not a healthy work life balance, that's not even a lifestyle, it's a deep core aspect of these people. The most effective engineers i know come from a military background, and not because the military somehow makes you a better coder, but because it can give you the attitude to persevere adapt and overcome intense mental and emotional challenges. Building products is great, I have nothing but love for those who sign off at 5pm - But every day including weekends the small group of so called \"10x\"ers are staying in touch long after the day is done and already done with the first round of work before the 8am standup. It's not fair to ask those who just want to take care of their children to rise to meet this level of commitment, and the engineers doing this usually are working hard to establish their own products and startups but the true ultimate goal of that is to be paid to write whatever we want, and the money is the means to the end of writing more code. Rest in peace to those who have not made it to their goals and no longer have the chance to try. Best wishes to those who want to have a home or family life yet compare themselves to those who have sacrificed everything for this life. Why do they do it? Most often a deep sense of duty, or some deep sense of unease that the soft glow of the terminal evokes. Perhaps both. All this to say that your pain and suffering is real and the true payout is just more pain and suffering. To those thinking about this life I recommend Musashi's Five Rings and to honor the Bushido. reply anal_reactor 11 hours agorootparent> All this to say that your pain and suffering is real and the true payout is just more pain and suffering. This is what I hate about modern workplace. The society clearly needs people who migrate databases at 3AM, but it never rewards them, instead just squeezes as much juice as possible before moving onto the next young motivated freshman. I'm not talking about financial reward, I'm talking about creating a work environment where migrating the fucking database FEELS rewarding. I truly miss the rush I had at the university when turning in a difficult project I had spent nights on. Instead I get to stare at a poster \"remember that HR is there to protect the company from you, we pay you to shut up\". Nowadays I try giving as few fucks as possible, and I'm looking for happiness in other areas of my life, which isn't easy. I'd rather see my passion die than witness it being exploited by the very same people who make me feel misunderstood. I am very much butthurt about how the society functions but I also realize I cannot do anything about it, so my next goal is to learn how to just relax, do nothing, and be happy about it. reply shrimp_emoji 12 hours agorootparentprevPfsh. I sign off at 1700 and then code on my own stuff. |] reply sh_hike 14 hours agorootparentprev+1 I spent most of my childhood and teenage years feeling depressed due to traumatic experiences. I failed at mostly everything until I started programming. I took some mushrooms last year that helped me stop this constant cycle of repeating thoughts. reply chrisweekly 14 hours agorootparentIt seems like there's an increasing degree of awareness (in some parts of the US) that psilocybin mushrooms can be transformative for treating PTSD and/or depression. I'm curious if you live in a US state, and what your experience was like.... reply financltravsty 10 hours agorootparentPsychedelics force you to break out of mental loops, and give you a new way to look at things (one that is already possible and intrinsic to you, but locked away by bad experiences) -- meaning a new, better way to live and experience life is possible. As someone who has used a lot of psychedelics, it is transformative, once you realize everything is literally all in your head. That no matter the pain and suffering you're going through, life can be beautiful, and lovely, and enjoyable. Psychedelics can even show you the things, issues, and parts of you that you've been running away from. But then the onus is on you. You have three options: go back to your normal life, and continue going through the same cycle of suffering (uncommon); continue (ab)using psychedelics to reach the same state (common); or take what you've learned and start making changes to yourself and your life, so you don't have to use them again (rare). reply norir 14 hours agorootparentprevYes and to add to this, I think also the longer you stay in the industry, the more you realize that the industry itself has intractable problems (at least on the scale at which you can effect change). The tension is whether or not to accept those problems or leave the industry. Unfortunately, I also think that many of the problems are both simultaneously solvable and intractable at the same time, which is particularly crazy making if one is so inclined. reply barbariangrunge 14 hours agoparentprevYou need wins to feel good. Or, projects with finish lines. But many projects go on year after year with no finish lines, ever, unless you or the company runs out of juice, or you move to a different company to do the same thing. In web dev, launch day is the closest you get, but it’s not a real finish line. Hitting kpi targets sort of counts, but it’s not psychologically satisfying like finishing a table or a piece of pottery or harvesting a crop and selling it or serving it for dinner. reply calvinmorrison 14 hours agorootparentOnly because programmers use up thier artistic juices at work. Plenty of my friends who are payroll or work in warehouses do not have any mental investment into work and use that energy outside of work to write, quilt, or do stimulating activities of thier own choice. For me after work I put on Judge Judy and let my brain rot reply preordained 12 hours agorootparentThis is real thing I'm glad you've acknowledged as more than just a figment of my imagination. There are things I want to do outside of work programming that are there own level of mental taxing and/or creative...side projects, competitive Magic the Gathering...and I while usually find some juice to squeeze into these, I do agree that it seems like many other professions leave a lot more in the tank. reply mrguyorama 12 hours agorootparentprevIndeed! Software development is both knowledge, and creative work, but the industry treats us like replaceable cogs in an assembly line, which is NOT knowledge or creative work. We even utilize work tracking systems made FOR assembly line work, like kanban. We KNOW that using your brain like that leads to mental exhaustion, in exactly the same way we know a tradey kneeling while they do carpet all workweek will have fucked up knees in twenty years. We also have clear scientific study that you physically cannot do knowledge work effectively for 40 hours a week, and actually start LOSING productive knowledge work performance after about 36 hours a week. The way that I describe it to people is imagine you really like Sudoku puzzles, but now you have been contracted to do the hardest possible Sudoku puzzles you are capable of for 40 hours a week. Sure monday might be a blast, but by thursday your brain HURTS, and is physically tired. The human brain chews through A LOT of energy, and puts out A LOT of metabolites while doing hard thinking stuff, like knowledge work. Then you take your weekend where you desperately try and catch up on the household stuff you've been putting off because you get off work and FEEL dumb, because your brain desperately wants to turn off, so you scramble to get some of it done, and then it's monday again. Meanwhile, the whole time that you're struggling with using something that isn't meant to be used 8 straight hours a day (unlike our heart or leg muscles which ARE optimized around constant usage), you're basically being gaslit by the whole system. \"This task is a medium\" except it wasn't groomed properly and of course there's twice as much work, but you aren't allowed to modify the ticket or change how you are working on things because a guy who spends all day putting numbers into a premade Excel sheet tells you that your \"predictability\" is going down, or that your \"throughput\" is inconsistent, as if there even SHOULD be consistency in a software project that does very different things and systems in different stages of the project, and after you spent 16 years learning ironclad math rules and 4 years learning Computer Science at your school of choice, you go into the field, and find that ANY bug is possible in modern computing, and every bug WILL be insane and flow through thirteen different abstraction layers and whisper demonic thoughts into your ear and now you get fucking PTSD whenever your mom asks you \"how could this bug happen in my iPhone\" and you're like \"hey man IDK probably the bluetooth stack corrupted the vibration motor controller and now your phone will play only country music whenever you get a text from your brother in law\", or your main app crashes because there's a damn bug in uWSGI where if you use any other C based code, it will inevitably fucking SEGFAULT because uWSGI goes out of it's way to dealloc during shutdown and manages to dealloc things that don't belong to it and the group who builds uWSGI has ignored the bug for a decade, and nobody fucking gets it because in other knowledge",

    "title": "Transformers.js – Pretrained Models in Browser for AI Tasks",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js",
    "originBody": "State-of-the-art Machine Learning for the web. Run 🤗 Transformers directly in your browser, with no need for a server! Transformers.js is designed to be functionally equivalent to Hugging Face's transformers python library, meaning you can run the same pretrained models using a very similar API. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as: 📝 Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and text generation. 🖼 Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation. 🗣 Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification. 🐙 Multimodal: zero-shot image classification. Transformers.js uses ONNX Runtime to run models in the browser. The best part about it, is that you can easily convert your pretrained PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX using 🤗 Optimum. For more information, check out the full documentation. Quick tour It's super simple to translate from existing code! Just like the python library, we support the pipeline API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with preprocessing of inputs and postprocessing of outputs, making it the easiest way to run models with the library. Python (original) Javascript (ours) from transformers import pipeline # Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis pipe = pipeline('sentiment-analysis') out = pipe('I love transformers!') # [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999806941}] import { pipeline } from '@xenova/transformers'; // Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis'); let out = await pipe('I love transformers!'); // [{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.999817686}] You can also use a different model by specifying the model id or path as the second argument to the pipeline function. For example: // Use a different model for sentiment-analysis let pipe = await pipeline('sentiment-analysis', 'Xenova/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment'); Installation To install via NPM, run: npm i @xenova/transformers Alternatively, you can use it in vanilla JS, without any bundler, by using a CDN or static hosting. For example, using ES Modules, you can import the library with:import { pipeline } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@xenova/transformers@2.17.0'; Examples Want to jump straight in?

Custom usage By default, Transformers.js uses hosted pretrained models and precompiled WASM binaries, which should work out-of-the-box. You can customize this as follows: Settings import { env } from '@xenova/transformers'; // Specify a custom location for models (defaults to '/models/'). env.localModelPath = '/path/to/models/'; // Disable the loading of remote models from the Hugging Face Hub: env.allowRemoteModels = false; // Set location of .wasm files. Defaults to use a CDN. env.backends.onnx.wasm.wasmPaths = '/path/to/files/'; For a full list of available settings, check out the API Reference. Convert your models to ONNX We recommend using our conversion script to convert your PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX models to ONNX in a single command. Behind the scenes, it uses 🤗 Optimum to perform conversion and quantization of your model. python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_idFor example, convert and quantize bert-base-uncased using: python -m scripts.convert --quantize --model_id bert-base-uncased This will save the following files to ./models/: bert-base-uncased/ ├── config.json ├── tokenizer.json ├── tokenizer_config.json └── onnx/ ├── model.onnx └── model_quantized.onnx For the full list of supported architectures, see the Optimum documentation. Supported tasks/models Here is the list of all tasks and architectures currently supported by Transformers.js. If you don't see your task/model listed here or it is not yet supported, feel free to open up a feature request here. To find compatible models on the Hub, select the \"transformers.js\" library tag in the filter menu (or visit this link). You can refine your search by selecting the task you're interested in (e.g., text-classification). Tasks Natural Language Processing Task ID Description Supported?

It makes spinning up a quick demo incredibly easy - I've used it in Observable notebooks a few times: - CLIP in a browser: https://observablehq.com/@simonw/openai-clip-in-a-browser - Image object detection with detra-resnet-50: https://observablehq.com/@simonw/detect-objects-in-images The size of the models feels limiting at first, but for quite a few applications telling a user with a good laptop and connection that they have to wait 30s for it to load isn't unthinkable. The latest releases adds binary embedding quantization support which I'm really looking forward to trying out: https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/releases/tag/2.17.... reply sroussey 19 hours agoparentBinary embeddings will require additional re-rankings, but will be fun to test. I’ve made an npm package of transformers.js v3, which I should update (not sure if I include this yet). Mostly, I’ve had to have a fork so it runs on bun. V3 when released will support bun just fine. Although the webgpu won’t work, but that’s optional. [edit: dm if you want to use it, I don’t want to promote a fork] reply dajas 17 hours agoprevI’m using this library to generate embeddings with gte-small (~0.07gb) and using Upstash Vector for storage. It’s only 384 dimensions but it works surprisingly well with a paragraph of text! It also ranks better than text-embedding-ada-002 on the leaderboard https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard reply 8ig8 20 hours agoprevThe Syntax podcast recently did an episode on Transformers.js and the developer… https://syntax.fm/show/740/local-ai-models-in-javascript-mac... reply grey8 20 hours agoprevtransformers.js is such a cool library. I made a small web app with it that uses it to remove backgrounds from images (with BRIA AI's RMBG1.4 model) at https://aether.nco.dev The fact you don't need to send your data to an API and this runs even on smartphones is really cool. I foresee lots of projects using this in the future, be it small vision, language or other utility models (depth estimation, background removal, etc), looks like a bright future for the web! I'm already working on my next project, and it'll definitely use transformers.js again! reply sroussey 19 hours agoparentI’m using it for a simple project: https://github.com/sroussey/ellmers My plan is to test embedding and retrieval strategies for different RAG strategies to be used by a server or electron app. reply jfoster 21 hours agoprevThis is super cool, but unfortunately it also seems super impractical. Models tend to be quite large, so even if a browser can run them, getting them to the browser involves either: 1. Large downloads on every visit to a website. 2. Large downloads and high storage consumption for each website using large models. (150 websites x 800 MB models => 120 GB of storage used) Both of those options seem terrible. I think it might make sense for browsers to ship with some models built in and be exposed via standardized web APIs in the future, but I haven't heard of any efforts to make that happen yet. reply xenova 20 hours agoparentWe’ve put out a ton of demos that use much smaller models (10-60 MB), including: - (44MB) In-browser background removal: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/remove-background-web. (We also put out a WebGPU version: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/remove-background-webgp...). - (51MB) Whisper Web for automatic speech recognition: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/whisper-web (just select the quantized version in settings). - (28MB) Depth Anything Web for monocular depth estimation: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/depth-anything-web - (14MB) Segment Anything Web for image segmentation: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/segment-anything-web - (20MB) Doodle Dash, an ML-powered sketch detection game: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/doodle-dash … and many many more! Check out the Transformers.js demos collection for some others: https://huggingface.co/collections/Xenova/transformersjs-dem.... Models are cached on a per-domain basis (using the Web Cache API), meaning you don’t need to re-download the model on every page load. If you would like to persist the model across domains, you can create browser extensions with the library! :) As for your last point, there are efforts underway, but nothing I can speak about yet! reply jph00 17 hours agorootparentWhy is only one of them on WebGPU? Is it because there additional tricky steps required to make a model work on WebGPU, or is there a limitation on what ops are supported there? I'm keen to do more stuff with WebGPU, so very interested to learn about challenges and limitations here. reply xenova 12 hours agorootparentWe have some other WebGPU demos, including: - WebGPU embedding benchmark: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/webgpu-embedding-benchm... - Real-time object detection: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/webgpu-video-object-det... - Real-time background removal: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/webgpu-video-background... - WebGPU depth estimation: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/webgpu-depth-anything - Image background removal: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/remove-background-webgp... You can follow the progress for full WebGPU support in the v3 development branch (https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/pull/545). To answer your question, while there are certain ops missing, the main limitation at the moment is for models with decoders... which are not very fast (yet) due to inefficient buffer reuse and many redundant copies between CPU and GPU. We're working closely with the ORT team to fix these issues though! reply jfoster 19 hours agorootparentprevThank you for the reply. Seems like all of the links are down at the moment, but it does sound a bit more feasible for some applications than I had assumed. Really glad to hear the last part. Some of the new capabilities seem fundamental enough that they ought to be in browsers, in my opinion. reply xenova 19 hours agorootparentOdd, the links seem to work for me. What error do you see? Can you try on a different network (e.g., mobile)? reply jfoster 18 hours agorootparentError is \"xenova-segment-anything-web.static.hf.space unexpectedly closed the connection.\" Works on mobile network, though, so might just be my internet connection. reply jsheard 21 hours agoparentprevBasically the same problem that's plagued games on the web ever since the first Unreal/Unity asmjs demos a decade ago, and pretty much no progress has been made towards a solution in that time. You just can't practically make a web app which needs gigs of data on the client because there's no reliable way to make sure it stays cached for as long as the user wants it to, and as you say, even if you could reliably cache it the download and storage would still be duplicated per site using the same model due to browsers cache partitioning policies. reply binarymax 20 hours agorootparentBeen beating this drum for years. Wrote this 9 years ago! https://max.io/articles/the-state-of-state-in-the-browser/ reply jampekka 20 hours agorootparentprevThere are ways to do it. E.g. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System... reply pjmlp 19 hours agorootparentprevActually more like the first Java Applets, Flash, and initially Unreal targeted Flash on the Web, and PNaCL, before asmjs came to be. The Unreal 3 demo using Flash is still on YouTube. And this is why most game studios are playing wait-and-see with streaming instead, proper native 3D APIs, with easier to debug tooling (Web still hasn't anything better than SpectorJS), and big size assets. reply fauigerzigerk 20 hours agorootparentprevThe File System Access API seems promising. reply jsheard 20 hours agorootparentI'm not sure more APIs are the solution, LocalStorage could already theoretically fill the role of a persistent large data store if browsers didn't cap the storage at 5-10MB for UX reasons. Removing that cap would require user facing changes to allow them to manage the storage used by sites and clean it up it manually when it inevitably gets bloated. Any new API which lets sites save stuff on the client is going to have the same issue. reply fauigerzigerk 20 hours agorootparent>Any new API which lets sites save stuff on the client is going to have the same issue. I don't think it would have the same issues, because the files could be stored in a user specified location outside the browser's own storage area. Browser vendors can't just delete stuff that may be used by other software on a user's system. And they cannot put a cap on it either, because users can store whatever they like in those directories, bypassing the browser entirely. But I have never used this API, so maybe I misunderstand how it's supposed to work. reply jsheard 19 hours agorootparentIf that's how it works then it would avoid the problem I mentioned, but the UX around using that to cache data internal to the site implementation sounds pretty terrible. You click on \"Listen to this article\" on a webpage and it opens a file chooser expecting you to open t2s-hq-fast-en+pl.model if you already have it? Users won't be able to make any sense of that. reply fauigerzigerk 19 hours agorootparentThe API (or at least the Chrome implementation) appears to be unfinished, but the plan seems to be to eventually support persistent directory permissions. So the web app could ask the user to pick a directory for model storage and henceforth store and load models from there without further interaction. reply wesbos 21 hours agoparentprevSome of the models are quite small and worth doing on-device vs the opposite of sending all the data to the server to process. The other huge benefit here is that transformers run in node.js and getting things running is way easier than trying to get some odd combination of python snd its dependencies to work reply fauigerzigerk 20 hours agoparentprevIt's an inherent problem with on-device AI processing, not just in the browser. I think this will only get better when operating systems start to preinstall models and provide an API that browser vendors can use as well. Even then I think cloud hosted models will probably always be far better for most tasks. reply Vetch 17 hours agorootparentThis specific problem is certainly not one for all on-devices AI processing. As someone else mentioned, there are unique UX and browser constraints that come from serving large compute intensive binary blobs through the browser (that are almost identically shared by games). Separately, having to rely on preinstallation very likely means stagnating on overly sanitized poorly done official instruction-tunes. With the exception of mixtral7x8, the trend has been the community overtime arrives at finetunes which far eclipse official ones. reply jfoster 19 hours agorootparentprev> I think cloud hosted models will probably always be far better for most tasks It might depend on just how good you need it to be. There are lots of use-cases where an LLM like GPT 3.5 might be \"good enough\" such that a better model won't be so noticeable. Cloud models will likely have the advantage of being more cutting-edge, but running \"good enough\" models locally will probably be more economical. reply fauigerzigerk 19 hours agorootparentI agree. The economic advantages of a hybrid approach could be very significant. reply yeldarb 20 hours agoparentprevNot using transformers, but we do object detection in the browser with small quantized yolo models that are about 7mb and run at 30+ fps on modern laptops via tensorflow.js and onnxruntime-web. Lots of cool demos and real world applications you can build with it. Eg we powered an AR card ID feature for Magic: The Gathering, built a scavenger hunt for SXSW, a test proctoring assistant (to warn you if you’re likely to get DQ’d for eg wearing headphones), and a pill counter for pharmacists. Really powerful for distribution to not make users install an app or need anything other than their smartphone. reply CapsAdmin 20 hours agoparentprevIf they are single files or directories they could be drag dropped on use. Not very convenient though. Maybe just some sort of api to give the website fine grained access to the filesystem might be enough. You'd specify a directory or single file the website can read from at any time. However at some point you will have to download large files. I feel when done implicitly it's bad user experience. On top of that the developer should implement a robust downloading system that can resume downloads, check for validity, etc. Developers rarerly bother with this, so the user experience is that it sucks. reply jampekka 20 hours agorootparentThere is such API. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System... reply elpocko 20 hours agorootparentStill requires drag&drop on most browsers because the File/DirectoryPicker API isn't universally supported. reply jampekka 20 hours agorootparentOrigin private file system is supported in all modern browsers. That does make sharing the models between origins difficult at best, but for one origin works fine. And in any case it's easier to direct users to install Chrome (or preferably Chromium) or instruct drag&drop than doing the brittle and error and bitrot prone virtualenv-pip-docker-git song and dance. reply bilekas 17 hours agoparentprevThis is probably a really stupid question, but can the models be streamed as they're being ran? So that you as the browser wouldn't need to wait for the entire download first? Or there is even the concept of ordered model transformers? As I ask it seems wrong to me but just to confirm? reply janalsncm 16 hours agorootparentUsually the inference time is small compared with download time so even if this were technically feasible you wouldn’t save much time. For reference I have a 31mb vision transformer I run in my browser. Building the inputs, running inference, and parsing the response takes less than half a second. reply bilekas 12 hours agorootparent> Usually the inference time is small compared with download time so even if this were technically feasible you wouldn’t save much time. I can understand that but where time is not a factor and solely a question of data, can a model be streamed? reply pests 7 hours agorootparentLLMs like ChatGPT only generate one token at a time. To generate more you run inference repeatedly until you reach a stop token or some other predetermined limit. I don't see streaming helping anything besides maybe Time-To-First-Inference, but regardless, you're still not getting any output until the entire weights are downloaded. reply jampekka 20 hours agoparentprevBrowsers can store stuff that's downloaded. Using e.g. the Filesystem API. These files can be accessed from multiple websites. Browser applications can run offline with service workers. Js/browser based solutions seem to be very often knee-jerk dismissed based on decade old understanding of browser capabilities. reply refulgentis 20 hours agoparentprevThis is pure free-association: models are below 80 MB, the rest are LLMs and aren't in scope. Whisper is 40 MB, embeddings are 23 MB. (n.b. parts of original comment that actively disclaim understanding: \"seems super impractical. Models tend to be quite large...150 websites x 800 MB models\") reply echelon 20 hours agoparentprevApple's future is predicated on local machine learning instead of cloud machine learning. They're betting big on it, and you can see the chess pieces being moved into place. They desperately do not want to become a thin client for magical cloud AI. I'd look to see Apple doing some stuff here. reply ranulo 20 hours agoparentprevMight make more sense for web apps and electron applications. reply breck 20 hours agoparentprevThis is why I was hoping the startup MightyApp would succeed. Then it would be practical to build web apps that operated on GB/TB of data in a single tab. Most of the time people would use their normal browser, but for big data jobs you would use your Mighty browser with persistence and unlimited RAM streamed from the cloud.

They have a webgpu embeddings benchmark in an HF space to give you a sense of the forward pass dynamics: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Xenova/webgpu-embedding-benchm... Its impressive for what it is, but training would be painful at those latencies (fp16, batch 32, sequence length 512 generates a ~500ms forward pass with a 22M param model) reply dheera 15 hours agorootparentThere might be applications for much smaller transformers in UI design.

Photograph: EPA Vietnam Vietnamese property tycoon sentenced to death in $27bn fraud case Truong My Lan found guilty of embezzling from Saigon Commercial Bank in case that was part of wider crackdown Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok and agencies Thu 11 Apr 2024 08.10 EDT Share A prominent property tycoon has been sentenced to death for her role in Vietnam’s biggest-ever fraud case. Truong My Lan, the chair of the developer Van Thinh Phat, was found guilty of embezzlement, bribery and violations of banking rules on Thursday, in a case that has shocked the country. A total of $12.5bn (£10bn) was embezzled, the equivalent of almost 3% of Vietnamese gross domestic product, but prosecutors said on Thursday the total damages caused by the scam now amounted to $27bn. “The defendant’s actions … eroded people’s trust in the leadership of the [Communist] party and state,” read the verdict at the trial in Ho Chi Minh City. Lan was found guilty of swindling money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) over a decade. She had been on tried alongside 85 others, including former central bankers and government officials, as well as previous SCB executives. The trial is part of a national corruption crackdown led by the secretary general of the Communist party of Vietnam, Nguyễn Phú Trọng. The campaign, which is also known as “Blazing Furnace” and has increased in recent years, has led to the indictment of thousands of people, as well as the resignation of two presidents and two deputy prime ministers. Lan, who was arrested in October 2022, had denied the charges. A relative told Reuters before the verdict that she would appeal. The death sentence is an unusually severe punishment for a corruption case. State media reported last week that Lan told the court she had joined the banking industry without sufficient experience and blamed a “lack of understanding of legal matters”. She said she had “thought of death” in desperation, and asked the court for leniency for her husband, a Hong Kong businessman, and niece who were on trial as accomplices. The verdicts announced on Thursday followed a five-week trial that has been covered in great detail in Vietnam’s tightly controlled state media. Documents related to the trial, kept in 105 boxes, weighed 6 tonnes, according to VN Express, which reported the authorities had installed security cameras and fire safety equipment to protect the evidence ahead of the hearings. More than 1,000 properties belonging to Lan have been seized, and nearly 2,700 individuals were summoned for the trial, which included 200 lawyers. Dr Nguyen Khac Giang, a visiting fellow at the Vietnam studies programme at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute, said the case was unprecedented, and a milestone in Vietnam’s anti-corruption crackdown. It was, he said, “the biggest case against a private business, with the biggest number of defendants, the biggest number of evidence and of course, the biggest number of money involved”. Although Lan did not directly hold executive power at SCB, she owned 91.5% of the bank’s shares through third parties and shell companies. She was accused of setting up fake loan applications to withdraw money from the bank over a period of 11 years, from 2012 to 2022. The loans accounted for 93% of the total credit the bank has issued, according to state media. To cover up the fraud, Lan and other SCB bankers were accused of giving state officials $5.2m, the largest bribe recorded in Vietnam. The money was handed over in Styrofoam boxes, Do Thi Nhan, a former chief banking inspector at the State Bank of Vietnam, said during the trial. Nhan said that after realising the boxes contained money, she refused the boxes but that Lan declined to take them back, state media reported. Since 2021, thousands of people have been indicted for corruption in the country, in what analysts have described as the most comprehensive anti-corruption effort in the history of the Communist party of Vietnam. Last month, the Vietnamese government announced the resignation of its second president in as many years, Vo Van Thuong, over alleged “violations and flaws” that had “negatively affected public perception, as well as the reputation of the party and the state”. He had been in power for just over a year after his predecessor, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, was forced out because of corruption scandals involving officials under his control. Evaluating public sentiment in Vietnam, a one-party state, is challenging. However, social media comments suggested many were shocked by the scale of the scandal, said Giang. While some welcomed the state crackdown, others questions how corruption on such a huge scale could go unchecked for so long. “[The case] might indirectly signal that the state hasn’t really been doing well in terms of managing the system in terms of the increasingly complex market economy and also the state is incapable of controlling their own public officials,” said Giang.

I assume it is US$ ? reply CamelCaseName 8 hours agorootparentThis is really so obvious that it doesn't merit a discussion. Yes, it is US dollars. Why should you assume $ refers to USD? Because the US is the global superpower. Trade and banking reserves overwhelmingly use USD. No other currency, and certainly none that use the $ symbol, even come remotely close to the USD. reply skissane 7 hours agorootparentIn my opinion, it is always better style to write US$ or USD than just $ - it is only a couple of extra characters, and it helps avoid any potential confusion I particularly hate businesses which sell stuff internationally who put $ on their website rather than US$ / AU$ / etc. You can’t assume that just because it is an American company that $ means US$, because some (but far from all) American companies detect the customer is coming from Australia/Canada/whatever and automatically display localised prices. And don’t get me started about the websites that seem to be offering too-good-to-be-true deals on Australian hotels until I realise they are actually showing US dollar prices, but $ instead of US$ makes that non-obvious reply handsclean 7 hours agorootparentprevAll that international trade and banking you talk about refers to it as USD or US$, not $. To 95% of the world, the relevance and influence of USD isn’t remotely close to their own currency’s. Sure, it’s relevant to some industries and to the larger economy – that makes it like CNY or EUR are to you, nothing more. I do think a USD assumption is reasonable, but only because the statement was made on HN, which is predominantly American. USD does not own the $ symbol outside of the US. reply tsimionescu 3 hours agorootparentIt absolutely does. If a French person or Japanese person or Brazilian or Russian or Chinese person sees a $ sign in relation to international news, I can assure you they will assume USD. Of course, a Canadian or Australian, or New Zealander, or Rhodesian, or Zambian, whose local currency also uses the same symbol, will tend to assume their local currency instead. But they are a minority of the world's population. reply seanhunter 2 hours agorootparentprev> All that international trade and banking you talk about refers to it as USD or US$, not $. That is not true. For example on foreign exchange markets \"Dollars\" means USD. If you want AUD it's \"ozzie\", and if you want CAD it's \"Loonie\"[1], and NZD is \"kiwi\".

I am Vietnamese, currently still living in the Vietnam, and I believe the VCP is doing what they are saying on the can: purging corruption (rather than this being political purge). Just as concrete counterexample on why it is not merely political purge: In the past 3 years, the last two Presidents of this term both had to resign due to corruption, the first one related to covid testing kit was from the Northern faction. The last two Chairman of People’s committee of Hanoi (basically Hanoi’s mayor/ governor) were also removed and arrested for corruption. Someone below was wondering what the trigger for this was, so here is it: people were tricked into buying bonds by SCB (My Lan’s bank) when trying to opening saving account. Some lost their entire life saving to the bullshit bonds, and to this day I still occasionally see protester in front of Vietnam’s state bank (it is on my daily commute).

Most of the growth could be attributed to Korean, Japanese, and Chinese conglomerates spending a LOT of money moving factories from China to VN in the 2014-22 period after China started trade wars with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the US. While this lead to massive capital expenditures, the average Vietnamese person's life didn't change too drastically, as most of the investments were located in Hanoi (Chinese) or HCMC (Korean+Japanese) and only captured by the capital owning class. While there are more FMCGs and brands now, almost everything has a luxury tax on it or is imported from the US, Thailand, or South Korea, and even Temu quality clothes cost as much as they would in the US, and furthermore - rent is insanely high in HCMC and Hanoi, so 50-60% of your income is spent on rent alone. Furthermore, party apparatchiks decided to maximize the graft they could partake in by investing heavily in boondoggle hotel and apartment projects (similar to the Ghost cities you see in China and India). When the COVID pandemic happened, the gravy train ended. Vietnam followed a zero-covid policy that caused migrant workers to return to their hometowns, and there was a massive corruption scandal around COVID testing infrastructure and repatriating Vietnamese migrant workers from abroad. This was also around the time an internal conflict began brewing between the Northern VCP (supported by the VinGroup billionaire who is also from Vietnamese Military royalty), Southern VCP (supported by this billionaire), the Army (they own Vietnam's largest telco and most of the PSUs), and the Ministry of Public Security (they have the dirt on everybody and are the actual enforcers in Vietnam). Basically, the MPS backed the Northern faction and won this round, and the Army stayed out of this fight in order to keep making money. That said, all this upper level turmoil (under the guise of a corruption purge) dented investor confidence recently, along with some very prominent infrastructure collapses like the power outages and the internet slowdowns. For example, this past Tet people didn't spend as much on fireworks or red money compared to the 2023 Tet, real estate projects have started slowing down, and it's not uncommon to see abandoned construction projects once you leave HCMC or Hanoi. If you're part of the expat Bui Vien/D1/Thao Dien scene you wouldn't notice this kind of stuff (they're too busy huffing balloons/nitrous despite it being banned in VN leaving surgeons to physically restrain patients), but once you go to \"real\" Saigon (eg. D10, D8) let alone outside of HCMC/Hanoi/DaNang/DaLat these issues become very prominent.

We are not talking about actual ghost cities (Ordos and Tianjin would not qualify as such). reply alephnerd 15 hours agorootparentprev> I don't think India has ghost cities in the way you mean There are plenty. Lots of Indian developers collapse due to corruption tangles or inability to secure financing, for example Jaypee Wish Town in NOIDA [0] or the New Chandigarh project in Punjab [1] Builders will take down payments from buyers and start construction, but might run out of money, get caught up in some corruption scandal, or fail financial compliance checks now that India has been cracking down on bad loans after the IL&FS almost collapsed in 2018. Luckily, India had UChicago and Harvard trained economic policymakers like Raghuram Rajan, Arvind Subramanian, and Krishnamurthy Subramanian (guys who if they decided to take American citizenship could have become head of the IMF or WB like their peers Ajay Banga and Gita Gopinath) reform the entire banking and finance sector in India. (And in all honestly, it looks like India might hit a similar bust in the next couple years now that the CEA is politically selected backbenchers now) Vietnam has hit the exact same hurdle India's economy hit in the 2010-17 stagflation and China during the 2015-16 financial crisis - high capex spending but very low consumer spending leaving it open to backlash caused by FDI variability. Lots of middle class Vietnamese have purchased condos or houses, but the builders collapsed or are in receivership. SCB (Truong's bank) is one of those banks financing these projects. Unlike China or India, the backbench of experienced policymakers in Vietnam is kinda empty, as most development in the 1980s-2000s was done by international development agencies, and the rest was basically privatized and done by Korean, Japanese, and Chinese companies (eg. The incomplete subway systems in HCMC and Hanoi built by Japan and China respectively). And unlike China, Vietnam is still fairly early in the value chain with major players like Intel considering leaving [2], and unlike India, Vietnam doesn't have a strong consumer or tertiary sector that can cushion the blow [3] A similar stagnation hit China in the 1990s after the Tiannamen Square massacre, but was resolved by allowing laisse faire capitalism and rolling out the red carpet for foreign and local investors, but the winning faction in this battle is much more skeptical of the anarcho-capitalism that arose in Vietnam in the 2010s.

Krishnamurthy Subramanian (Rajan's former doctoral student from decades ago and now Executive Director at the IMF) supported it. My hunch is Krishnamurthy's support came because he worked closely with Luigi Zingales when they were at UChicago, and Zingales' economic philosophy strongly supported these kinds of shocks, plus it allowed Krishnamurthy to climb up the ladder. Demonetization was brutal, but at least it pushed hundreds of millions from being unbanked to banked, thus making it easier to enforce taxation (while also converting black money into white money). A similar shock will be needed for both India and Pakistan to revoke the Land Acquisition Act (the British holdover which has held back both countries), as well as to do a judicial overhaul.

Regulations for financial institutions are not strong here. Rich bank owners use bank as a facade to collect money from a lot of people to invest in usually real estate development projects.

Some democratic countries have independent apolitical anti-corruption agencies. For example, the Australian state of New South Wales has an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) which is headed by a judge. Few seriously argue it is politically motivated, although it has caused controversy by destroying the careers of politicians over what some see as relatively minor offences (e.g. in 2014, the state Premier was forced to resign because he gave it false testimony over a $3,000 bottle of wine, although he insisted the falsehood was due to forgetfulness not intentional lying) It also has an official definition of corruption, and subjects of investigation can challenge in the courts whether the investigation is consistent with that definition. In 2015, a senior prosecutor succeeded in getting a ruling from Australia’s highest court that ICAC had overstepped its authority in investigating her for a personal matter unrelated to her job as a prosecutor (she had been recorded on a wiretap giving advice to her son’s girlfriend on how to evade a police investigation into a traffic accident).

In this way the state's power is far, far more illegitimized by the fact that it's apparently fine with people stealing incredible sums of money either from itself or from it's citizens and seems content to levy meaningless fines on the perpetrator after the fact, if even that. (or, in my leftier and more conspiratorial groups, that the weakness of the state to prosecute financial crimes is a direct result of the system being designed by rich people to facilitate the activities of other rich people, but I digress) The only ones in recent memory I can recall are Sam Bankman-Fried, which is still ongoing, and Elizabeth Holmes, both of whom seemed to have committed the proper crime of stealing from other rich people, whereas the ones who steal from the working/middle class are left largely untouched. A coincidence I'm sure. Where Government funds land in terms of \"is this rich people's money or poor people's money\" is up to the reader of the comment to determine, that one's prosecution rate does seem to trend more political, as tons of incredibly wealthy people are milking the government cow for absolutely mind-bending amounts of money and delivering basically nothing. > One interpretation, is that the American state, does not feel the need to demonstrate its authority in such a dramatic way.

It's 60-40 Chaebols-Local Oligarchs And the VCP is fairly worried that a 1980s SK or 1990s PRC style democracy movement might arise, because unlike China today, the Vietnamese government is very incompetent and pays their civil servants shit ($200/mo for senior govt doctors for example, $600/mo for the head of the Politburo, most soldiers are abused and unpaid conscripts), and western services like FB cannot be cracked down because it will scare western investors away and because most of the country is still dependent on the remittences of the 2nd-3rd gen diaspora living in North America and Eastern Europe, and the migrant workers in JP/SK/TW/CN.

    "originBody": "getlago / lago Public Notifications Fork 243 Star 6k Code Issues 5 Pull requests Actions Wiki Security Insights Using Clickhouse to scale an events engine Jump to bottom Anh-Tho Chuong edited this page · 1 revision Like many companies, we had to change our database stack midway while scaling our core product Lago, an open-source usage-based billing platform. As we grew more popular, we began ingesting millions of events every minute. And our rudimentary Postgres-only stack wasn’t cutting it. We were suffering heavy load times, impacting our entire app’s performance. After some exploration, we decided to use a distributed ClickHouse instance strictly for our streamed events. Our analytics services were now able to directly query ClickHouse, an OLAP database. For all other data needs, we kept Postgres. The strategy was successful. Since the refactor, we haven’t looked back. Today, we’re going to explore that decision for a hybrid database stack, and more specifically, why we decided to go with ClickHouse. OLTP versus OLAP databases Most developers, including junior developers, have experience using OLTP (online transactional processing) databases such as Postgres. As the name implies, OLTP databases are designed for processing transactions. A transaction is one of many different types of instructions that software might invoke to a database. The most common are: (i) read, (ii) insert, (iii) update and (iv) delete. OLTP databases are typically general-purpose databases. Because they support every type of data processing, they could be used for any data problem within limits. And, even at a large scale, they are fantastic for software that require: atomic transactions, where a set of grouped transactions either all occur or don’t occur at all consistency, where queries in-between writes and updates are deterministic and predictable For most problems, these are important qualities. For some, they are crucial. A banking application can’t have discrepancies whenever money is transferred between accounts. For those problems, an OLTP database is needed for cents-level accuracy. Today, we still use Postgres as our primary database, configured [via our database.yml file](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/config/database.yml#L5). And given that we use Ruby on Rail’s, [our Postgres schema](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/db/schema.rb) is automatically generated by Rail’s [Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html), an ORM that manages our various models such as [charges](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models/charge_spec.rb), [credit notes](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models/credit_note_spec.rb), [invoices](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models/invoice_spec.rb), [invites](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models/invite_spec.rb), [fees](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models/fee_spec.rb), [coupons](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models/coupon_spec.rb), and [much, much more](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/tree/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/spec/models). We write some custom queries given [the performance limits of the ORM](https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Is-ORM-still-an-%27anti-pattern%27%3F), but otherwise lean heavily on Active Record for most transactions. So where do OLAP (online analytical processing) databases like ClickHouse come in? Well, Postgres was designed to be strictly atomic and consistent; two properties that require for data to be fully ingested before any query that might process them is run. This creates a problem for tables where entries are ingested in the millions per minutes (e.g. billable events, especially those for infrastructure services like managed servers). Specifically, the issue isn’t ingesting data, but rather simultaneously handling expensive analytical queries without locking up the queue. These data-summarizing problems are where OLAP databases like ClickHouse shine. OLAP databases are designed for two primary problems—(i) efficiently answering complex read queries with approximate accuracy and (ii) batch processing a large number of write queries. However, OLAP databases are terrible for mutating data (where the entire database often needs to be re-written) or deleting data. Different OLAP solutions (e.g. ClickHouse, QuestDB, Druid) have different strengths, and we’ll dive into the specific strain of traits that made ClickHouse a winning solution in the next section. But all OLAP solutions share a common quality—data is stored in an inverted layout relative to OLTP databases like Postgres. Now, from the user’s standpoint, the table’s columns and rows are still just columns and rows. But, physically in memory, data is scanned column-by-column, not row-by-row. This makes aggregations—such as adding every value in a certain field—very, very fast, as the relevant data is read sequentially. Enter ClickHouse, our chosen OLAP solution [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) is an open-source tool spun out from a closed-source algorithm used by Yandex’s website analytics product. Today, ClickHouse is shepherded by [ClickHouse Inc](https://clickhouse.com/company/our-story) with notable contributions by [Altinity](https://altinity.com). To date, it is one of the most successful OLAP databases, both commercially and qualitatively. ClickHouse has three notable features that make it an analytics powerhouse—(i) dynamic materialized views, (ii) specialized engines, and (iii) vectorized query execution. To summarize each: Dynamic Materialized Views. Materialized Views are query-able views that are generated from raw data in underlying tables. While many databases do support materialized views, including Postgres, ClickHouse’s materialized views are dynamic, efficiently refreshing content whenever new content is ingested. These contrasts with ordinary materialized views which are just snapshots of a specific point of time, and are very expensive to refresh. Specialized Engines. Many databases have a single engine for utilizing hardware to process queries / transactions. ClickHouse, however, has dedicated engines for specific mathematical functions, such as summing or averaging numbers. Vectorized Query Execution. ClickHouse’s specialized engines leverage vectorized query execution, where the hardware uses multiple units in parallel to achieve a communal result (known as SIMD—Single Instruction, Multiple Data). Combined with its columnar storage, these traits allow ClickHouse to easily sum, average, or generally aggregate database values. As a caveat, Postgres isn’t entirely incapable of achieving similar results, but only via a bastion of optimizations. For instance, there is a third-party [vectorized executor](https://github.com/citusdata/postgres_vectorization_test) designed for Postgres that imitates ClickHouse’s native support. There is also [a Fast Refresh Module](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-fast-refresh-capability-in-amazon-rds-for-postgresql/) that uses Postgres’s log to dynamically update materialized views. Coupled with Postgres triggers, developers could create a ClickHouse-like set-up. But all of these techniques require significant set-up work and additional columns to reach any efficiency that is even comparable to ClickHouse’s. A relevant meme from my Postgres vs Clickhouse guide for PostHog Recently, the most interesting rift in the Postgres vs OLAP space is [Hydra](https://www.hydra.so), an open-source, column-oriented distribution of Postgres that was very recently launched (after our migration to ClickHouse). Had Hydra been available during our decision-making time period, we might’ve made a different choice. However, ClickHouse remains an incredible pick, given its mature product, large community, hardware optimizations, and ease of use side-by-side with Postgres. Of course, migrating analytics processes to ClickHouse is only half the battle. The next is actually deploying ClickHouse to production—where a few strategies exist. How we utilize ClickHouse When discussing our ClickHouse implementation, there are fundamentally two different topics—what we use ClickHouse for, and how our ClickHouse instance is deployed and maintained. What we query ClickHouse for Our ClickHouse instance [ingests raw billable events](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/app/models/clickhouse/events_raw.rb#L3) dispatched by our users. While we don’t write our own ClickHouse schema (as it is auto-generated by ActiveRecord), it is written to a file, [available in our open-source repository](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/db/clickhouse_schema.rb#L4). Our ClickHouse instance only has two tables—raw_events and raw_events_queue—alongside one materialized view, events_raw_mv . That’s it. We don’t store any of the other “business-critical” data on ClickHouse because they aren’t analytical queries. In detail, our [raw_events_queue](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/db/clickhouse_migrate/20231026124912_create_events_raw_queue.rb) is where events are initially streamed to via [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org), open-source event streaming software. From it, the [events_raw_mv](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/db/clickhouse_migrate/20231030163703_create_events_raw_mv.rb) is generated with ClickHouse’s [cast()](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions) function, which maps the event’s metadata from a JSON blob to a string array. Finally, this materialized view pushes data to the [raw_events](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/db/clickhouse_migrate/20231024084411_create_events_raw.rb) table. This is a [MergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree) table that is apt for a large number of writes. raw_events is what Lago’s general codebase interfaces with via our [ClickHouseStores](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/app/services/events/stores/clickhouse_store.rb#L14) class, which is tapped when [aggregating billable metrics](https://github.com/getlago/lago-api/blob/e0da0a0b136577bffe5a1b8dac8747c913f7cdf1/app/services/billable_metrics/aggregation_factory.rb#L18). raw_events uses a tuple of organization_id, external_subscription_id, code, and a timestamp as primary keys; given ClickHouse’s [sophisticated support for primary key tuples](https://medium.com/datadenys/how-clickhouse-primary-key-works-and-how-to-choose-it-4aaf3bf4a8b9), this helps ClickHouse locate rows very quickly. How we deploy ClickHouse Because ClickHouse is an open-source database, it could be self-hosted on any ordinary Linux server. However, many companies trust managed database solutions because they (i) often reduce overall costs, (ii) make scaling databases easier, and (iii) take care of safe replication/backups. One of the most popular options is ClickHouse Inc’s ClickHouse Cloud offering, which offers a serverless ClickHouse instance with decoupled compute and storage. However, we instead opted for Altinity Operator, which deploys and manages ClickHouse in a Kubernetes cluster in our existing cloud offering. We preferred this approach given more flexibility due to custom definitions, efficiency on cost, and ease of maintenance. Other notable open-source projects that use ClickHouse We aren’t the only open-source project that uses ClickHouse; in fact, we aren’t even the only open-source project that migrated from Postgres to ClickHouse. A notable example is [PostHog](https://posthog.com), an open-source analytics suite that switched from [Postgres to ClickHouse](https://posthog.com/blog/clickhouse-announcement) given the sheer amount of web events they were processing per second. Another great example is Gitlab, which used ClickHouse to store data of streamed events [in their observability suite](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/architecture/blueprints/clickhouse_usage/). In general, it’s common for open-source companies (and closed-source projects alike) to find their general-purpose database like Postgres or mySQL ill-suited as they start to scale. Even some closed-source solutions, like the HTTP data-streaming product TinyBird, have made [open-source contributions to ClickHouse](https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/we-launched-an-open-source-clickhouse-knowledge-base) given their dependence on it. Slowly, ClickHouse is building the same level of success in the OLAP world as Postgres is achieving in the OLTP space. Closing Thoughts Due to the hardware optimizations of inverting table layouts, there is no one-size-fits-all database as applications scale. We ran into that problem fairly early in our journey given the event-heavy nature of our product. However, that doesn’t meant that every team needs to start with an OLTP + OLAP stack—just to be ready for it when the moment arrives.

If you're deleting rows that already feels like maybe it's not the intended use case. I think about clickhouse as taking in a firehose of immutable data that you want to aggregate/analyze/report on.

I'll make up an example, the orientation, speed and acceleration of every Tesla vehicle in the world in real time every second. reply joshstrange 14 hours agorootparentIt's to power all our analytics. We ETL data into it and some data is write-once so we don't have updates/deletes but a number of our tables have summary data ETL'd into them which means cleaning up the old rows. I'm sure CH shines for insert-only workloads but that doesn't cover all our needs. reply darthShadow 12 hours agorootparentYou have already gotten excellent options from the other comments, but here's another one that's not been mentioned yet. You may want to consider adjusting your partition key (if feasible) as a function of datetime so you can just drop a complete partition when required, rather than needing separate delete queries. In my experience, it has proven to be a very quick and clean way to clear out older data. reply nsguy 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can always use different databases for different use cases. There are many applications that require extremely high insertion rates (millions of records per second), very large total number of rows (billions, trillions) and flexible/fast querying/aggregation with high read rates (100's of millions or higher rows/s) and that's sort of the sweet spot IMO for ClickHouse and where you'll be pressed to find alternatives. I'm sure it can be used in other situations but maybe there are more choices if you're in those. reply bigger_cheese 10 hours agorootparent>You can always use different databases for different use cases. Unfortunately this is not always realistic, especially in large organizations, I know where I am there is a big push from top (i.e the IT budget people) to standardize everything they want to simplify licenses, support contracts etc. I may not be doing cutting edge stuff (I work at an Industrial plant) but we do have mixed data use cases where it could be beneficial to use different dbs but realistically I don't see it happening. reply mosen 14 hours agorootparentprevHave you looked into the ReplacingMergeTree table engine?

It’s a table design optimised for specific workloads, and the docs and design detail those tradeoffs. We use it at work for workloads that can tolerate “retreading” over stale data, because it means they can efficiently write to the db without round tripping, or locking and row updates, and without the table growing massive. It works fantastically in our use case. reply zX41ZdbW 14 hours agoparentprevInteresting about \"Timeouts (only 30s???)\" - most likely, this is a limitation configured explicitly for a user on your server. You can set it up with the `max_execution_time`, and by default, it is unlimited. For example, I've set it up, along with many more limitations for my public playground https://play.clickhouse.com/, and it allows me to, at least, make it public and not worry much. It could also be a configuration of a proxy if you connect through a proxy. ClickHouse has built-in HTTP API, so you can query it directly from the browser or put it behind Cloudflare, etc... Where do you host ClickHouse? reply joshstrange 14 hours agorootparentI can believe it's a config issue, I'll have to look into it. I didn't setup the cluster/dbs and when I asked about I was told \"use the cli\". I'll try to see if I can get that fixed. reply michaelbuckbee 7 hours agorootparentAny chance you CH is proxied through a Heroku app?

I guess maybe the cost? reply mnahkies 3 hours agoparentI'm a big fan of big query as well, but the cost can be problematic if you're not careful. Generally speaking I've found it manageable if you make good use of partitioning and do incremental aggregation (we use dbt, though you have to do some macro gymnastics to make the partition key filter eligible for pruning due to restrictions on use of dynamic values https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/incremental-models) It's also important to monitor your cost and watch for the point where switching from the per-tb queried pricing model to slots makes sense. reply alooPotato 3 hours agorootparentyeah between partitioning, clustering, materialized views, and smart tuning it seems like there are enough knobs to control costs. reply lysecret 56 minutes agoparentprevYep love it too, especially with external data on GCS.

It was static data with occasional full replacement loads. We got the DB down to ~ 60GB, with query speeds about 45x faster. Now, the postgres schema wasn't ideal, and we could have saved ~ 3x on it with corresponding speed increases for queries with a refactor similar to the clickhouse schema, but that wasn't really enough to move the needle to near real-time queries. Ultimately, the entire clickhouse DB was smaller than the original postgres primary key index. The index was too big to fit in memory on an affordable machine, so it's pretty obvious where the performance is coming from. reply drewda 12 hours agoprevThis change may make sense for Lago as a hosted multi-tenant service, as offered by Lago the company. Simultaneously this change may not make sense for Lago as an open-source project self-hosted by a single tenant. But that may also mean that it effectively makes sense for Lago as a business... to make it harder to self host. I don't at all fault Lago for making decisions to prioritize their multi-tenant cloud offering.

I usually need indexes so queries are not slow. Perhaps I could insert into a staging table then bulk copy the data over to an indexed table, but that seems silly. reply ndriscoll 5 hours agorootparentIf your application language/framework allows, you can do the batching there. e.g. have your single request handler put work into an (in-memory) queue. Then another thread/async worker pull batches off the queue and do your db work in batch, and trigger the response to the original handler. In an http context, this is all synchronous from the client perspective, and you can get 2-10x throughput at a cost of like 2 ms latency under load. I gave more detail with a toy example here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39245416 I've since played around with this a little more and you can do it pretty generically (at least make the worker generic where you give it a function `Chunk[A] => Task[Chunk[Result[B]]]` to do the database logic). I don't have that handy to post right now, but probably you're not using Scala anyway so the details aren't that relevant.

    "originBody": "Stacking Triangles for Fun and Profit April 8, 2024 Math Visualization Notation Geometric Proof of Angle Addition Formulas Pythagorean Theorem Derivatives Arc Length Conclusion One thing you may have noticed about the trigonometric functions sine and cosine is that they seem to have no agreed upon definition. Or rather, different authors choose different definitions as the starting point, mainly based on convenience. This isn’t problematic or even particularly unusual in mathematics - as long as we can derive any of the other forms from any starting point, it makes little theoretical difference which we start from since they’re all equivalent anyway. The most common starting points are the series definitions, the solution to an initial value problem involving ordinary differential equations, or using complex numbers as Euler’s formula. You can find detailed descriptions of these on the Wikipedia page. These are all fine starting points as far as they go, and as I said before they are all equivalent. What struck me as odd when I was an undergraduate, and still strikes me to this day, is that none of these are the obvious trigonometric definitions about the opposite and adjacent sides of a right triangle. Aren’t axioms and definitions supposed to be obvious, so obvious and self-evident they can’t be doubted? So why are we using a highly non-obvious formulation as our definition, and then backing into the intuitive form as a theorem? The answer is actually simple - the proofs are slightly shorter when we do it that way. However, I never liked this approach because it’s very much like pulling a rabbit out of a hat, or perhaps more like pulling a “previously prepared” turkey out of the oven on a cooking show. It gives students a completely backward impression of how mathematics is done. We don’t start from intuitive definitions and work on them until we can understand them more deeply or connect them to other structures; no, we simply write down a bizarre and unmotivated equation and show it has the desired properties, with no mention of how anyone thought it up in the first place. This often leads to shorter, more elegant proofs but at the cost of completely failing to teach the student how to actually “do” mathematics. I mean, look at this thing: \\[ \\sin(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1} \\] Anyone who looks at that and says, “yes, that’s a self-evident definition” is either lying or Ramanujan. The differential equation definition is almost as bad. The equations themselves are fairly simple: \\[ \\begin{align} \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} &= -y \\\\\\ y(0) &= 0 ,& y’(0) &= 1 \\end{align} \\] The problem is that we have to rely on the ODE existence and uniqueness theorem which is non-trivial to prove; the most common proof involves invoking the Banach fixed point theorem. That seems like a weirdly technical approach to defining what should be an elementary concept. What would be nice would be to start from the intuitive, geometric definition: \\[ \\begin{align} \\sin(\\theta) &= \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\\\\\ \\cos(\\theta) &= \\frac{\\text{adjacent}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} \\end{align} \\] and derive the analytic definitions by working forward. I think I’ve found a clear and unambiguous way to explain this at the undergraduate level. Briefly, we’ll prove the angle addition formulas using geometric methods, then show how this leads immediately to the other results. Since we’re interested in establishing a foundation for sine and cosine from geometric principles, we have to establish some ground rules. It’s of crucial importance that you ignore everything you already know about these functions. Yes, I know you can prove this stuff more easily from Euler’s formula. Yes, I know there a dozen different ways to prove any of these. For the moment, pretend like you don’t know anything about sine and cosine except the geometric definitions, and we won’t use anything unless we’ve proved it earlier. The structure of the proofs will be as follows: As the goal is to ground everything on the geometric definition in an easy-to-follow way, jumping ahead and using theorems before we’ve established that foundation defeats the purpose. Notation In the first draft of this proof, I left points unlabeled and simply referred to “the middle triangle” or the “right angle in the top triangle” and so on. The idea was to keep things simple for a broad audience but I quickly found it was very hard to follow. Instead, we’ll use the conventional notation, which I’ll briefly review here. We use upper case roman letters such as $A$ or $B$ to label points. The line segment connecting two points is written $\\overline{AB}$. The triangle with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ is written $\\triangle ABC$. Even though the notation symbol shows an equilateral triangle, the triangle in question doesn’t have to be. I’ll write “The right triangle $\\triangle ABC$” if it’s important to specify that the triangle is a right triangle. The above are all fairly self-explanatory, but the last bit of notation can be confusing if you don’t know exactly what it means. To describe the angle at $B$ between $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{BC}$, we write $\\angle ABC$. $\\angle ABC$ is always equal to $\\angle CBA$, but $\\angle BAC$ or $\\angle ACB$ refer different angles located at a different part of the diagram. To locate an angle $\\angle ABC$ in the diagram, first look for the point labeled with the middle letter $B$. Then imagine lines connecting $B$ to $A$ and $C$ - the angle referred to is the angle between those lines. I know this notation takes some getting used to, but it allows us to unambiguously refer to angles on a cluttered diagram. Geometric Proof of Angle Addition Formulas We set up the problem by simply stacking two right triangles on top of each other. Let’s define $\\overline{AB}$ to have a length of 1. $\\overline{AB}$ is hypotenuse of the right triangle $\\triangle ABC$. Since the hypotenuse is length 1, the lengths of opposite and adjacent sides are simple $\\sin(\\beta)$ and $\\cos(\\beta)$ respectively. We can do the same thing for the triangle $\\triangle ACD$ and angle $\\alpha$ but with the twist that hypotenuse of this triangle is no longer 1 but instead $\\cos(\\beta)$. Therefore, the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides have to each be multiplied by $\\cos(\\beta)$. Let’s add another triangle to our diagram by extending $\\overline{CD}$ out in a straight line and drawing a perpendicular line through the point $B$. This gives us the triangle BCE. Since $\\overline{BE}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{EC}$ it is in fact a right triangle. Now, the line $\\overline{EC}$ is perpendicular to $\\overline{AD}$, and the line $\\overline{BC}$ is perpendicular is $\\overline{AC}$, so the angle $\\angle BCE$ is the same as the angle $\\angle CAD$ which we called $\\alpha$. Now that we know the hypotenuse and one angle of the right triangle $\\triangle BCE$ we can once again use the definitions of sine and cosine to label the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides. We’ll do something similar for the last triangle. We’ll draw a line perpendicular to $\\overline{AD}$ through $A$ and extend it up to point $F$ where it intersects the extension of $\\overline{BE}$. $\\overline{FE}$ and $\\overline{AD}$ are parallel (because they are both perpendicular to $\\overline{AF}$) therefore $\\angle FBA$ is equal to $\\angle BAD$ which is the sum of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. So we can label this angle $\\alpha+\\beta$. For the fourth and final time, we’ll use the definition of sine and cosine to label opposite and adjacent sides of the right triangle $\\triangle FAB$. Note that this is where the expressions $\\cos(\\alpha + \\beta)$ and $\\sin(\\alpha + \\beta)$ enter the proof. So far, everything has been construction - adding triangles and chasing angles to label edge lengths. But now the diagram is complete, and we can easily read off the angle addition formulas by equating opposite sides. Note that $FEAD$ forms a rectangle; $\\overline{FE}$ and $\\overline{AD}$ are parallel which proves $\\overline{AF}$ and $\\overline{DE}$ are equal; likewise $\\overline{AF}$ and $\\overline{ED}$ are parallel, which proves $\\overline{FE}$ and $\\overline{AD}$ are equal. All we have to do now is equate opposite pairs of sides: \\[ \\begin{align} \\cos(\\alpha+\\beta) + \\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta) = \\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(\\beta) \\\\\\ \\sin(\\alpha+\\beta) = \\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(\\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta) \\end{align} \\] Finally, we rearrange these slightly to put them in the canonical form of the angle addition formulas: \\[ \\begin{align} \\cos(\\alpha+\\beta) &= \\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(\\beta) - \\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta) \\\\\\ \\sin(\\alpha+\\beta) &= \\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(\\beta) + \\cos(\\alpha) \\sin(\\beta) \\end{align} \\] Pythagorean Theorem OK, now that we have the angle addition formulas, let’s put them to work. First, we’d like sine and cosine to trace out a unit circle; in other words, we want to make sure that $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$ for all angles $\\theta$. There are lots of ways to prove this, but the angle addition formula provides one of the neatest approaches. Instead of adding two separate angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, we’ll use $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$. These two angles sum to zero, so we have: \\[ \\begin{align} 1 &= \\cos(0) \\\\\\ &= \\cos(\\theta - \\theta) \\\\\\ &= \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(-\\theta) - \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(-\\theta) \\\\\\ &= \\cos(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) + \\sin(\\theta)\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\\ &= \\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) \\end{align} \\] Here, we additionally used the fact that sine and cosine are odd and even functions respectively, so $\\cos(-x) = \\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(-x) = - \\sin(x)$. That means that the Pythagorean theorem is actually an immediate corollary of the angle addition formula for cosine. Derivatives Another neat thing we can do with the angle addition formulas is calculate the derivatives of sine and cosine. This is because the limit definition of derivative includes a term with $f(x+h)$ which we can handle with the formulas. \\[ \\begin{align} \\frac{d}{dx} \\sin(x) &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x + h) - \\sin(x)}{h} \\\\\\ \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)\\cos(h) + \\cos(x)\\sin(h) - \\sin(x)}{h} \\end{align} \\] By considering a triangle with hypotenuse 1 and a very small “opposite” side, it’s not hard to see geometrically that $\\sin(h) \\approx h$ and $\\cos(h) \\approx 1$ when $h$ is close to zero. Therefore we have: \\[ \\begin{align} \\frac{d}{dx} \\sin(x) &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(x) + \\cos(x) h - \\sin(x)}{h} \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos(x) h}{h} \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= \\cos(x) \\end{align} \\] The equivalent argument for $\\cos(x)$ is: \\[ \\begin{align} \\frac{d}{dx} \\cos(x) &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos(x + h) - \\cos(x)}{h} \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos(x)\\cos(h) - \\sin(x)\\sin(h) - \\cos(x)}{h} \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos(x) - \\sin(x) h - \\cos(x)}{h} \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{-\\sin(x) h}{h} \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} &= -\\sin(x) \\end{align} \\] Once we know these first derivatives, computing higher derivates is straightforward. For example, the second derivatives are: \\[ \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\sin(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\cos(x) = -\\sin(x) \\] \\[ \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \\cos(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} -\\sin(x) = -\\cos(x) \\] With just these second derivatives, we can already motivate the initial value problem ODE definition of sine and cosine. It’s equally obvious that we can continue the process indefinitely, alternating between sine and cosine. Since we know $\\sin(0) = 0$ and $\\cos(0) = 1$, we can evaluate all derivatives of sine and cosine at zero, allowing us to calculate the Maclaurin series. This gives us the series form. Arc Length The above shows that sine and cosine trace out a unit circle, but there is one final thing we need to show to fully connect the geometric and analytic definitions. The formula for arc length is: \\[ L = \\int_{a}^{b} \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\right)^2} \\, dt \\] Let’s write down the equations for the unit circle in parametric form. Luckily, we already worked out the first derivatives: \\[ \\begin{align} x(t) = \\cos(t), & \\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\sin(t) \\end{align} \\] \\[ \\begin{align} y(t) = \\sin(t), & \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\cos(t) \\end{align} \\] Then, substituting these into the arc length formula: \\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\theta} \\sqrt{(-\\sin(t))^2 + (\\cos(t))^2} \\, dt \\] Simplifying inside the square root: \\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\theta} \\sqrt{\\sin^2(t) + \\cos^2(t)} \\, dt \\] Since we showed above that $\\sin^2(t) + \\cos^2(t) = 1$ for all $t$, this further simplifies to: \\[ L = \\int_{0}^{\\theta} 1 \\, dt \\] Integrating from $0$ to $\\theta$: \\[ L = \\left. t \\right|_{0}^{\\theta} = \\theta - 0 = \\theta \\] This tells us that the parameter $t$ we used is equal to the arc length along the unit circle; in other words, the angle expressed in radians. Conclusion We’ve shown that all of usual definitions of sine and cosine can be derived from the geometric definition, and that this can be made elementary if we start by proving the angle addition formulas using geometric arguments. The geometric proof itself is quite beautiful and easy to remember as it is simply a matter of stacking two triangles, building a rectangle around them, and equating the opposing sides. We offer this as a more pedagogically sound and historical accurate way to motivate the various definitions of sine and cosine.",

    "commentBody": "Stacking triangles for fun and profit (oranlooney.com)178 points by olooney 20 hours agohidepastfavorite58 comments gjm11 19 hours agoI don't agree with the perspective taken here; I don't see any reason to think that the definition in terms of triangles is the simplest or most natural, and I suspect the author feels that way just because it's how they were first taught about trigonometrical functions. Of course I do agree that definitions in terms of power series and differential equations are less natural and require heavier mathematical machinery. But: the \"right-angled triangle\" definitions have the severe drawback of only applying to a restricted range of angles, and their relationship to those higher-tech definitions is more indirect than necessary. Instead, I claim that the One True Definition of the trig functions is: if you start with the point (1,0) and rotate it through an angle t (anticlockwise, which is conventionally the \"positive\" direction in maths) about (0,0), then the point where it ends up is (cos t, sin t). This is just as simple, and just as geometrical, as the \"triangle\" definition. It leads directly to the differential-equation characterization (which in turn leads easily to the power series). For angles between 0 and pi/2, it's obviously equivalent to the \"triangle\" definition. Can you get the addition theorems easily from this definition? Yes, and (again) without the severe drawback of only applying when all the angles involved are between 0 and pi/2 as for the \"triangle\" definition. Start with a diagram showing the points (0,0), (cos t, 0), (0, sin t), (cos t, sin t). Now rotate the whole thing through an angle u about the origin. Obviously (0,0) stays where it is. (cos t, 0) just goes to cos t times (cos u, sin u), i.e., to (cos t cos u, cos t sin u). If you turn your head through 90 degrees it becomes clear that (0, sin t) similarly goes to (- sin t cos u, sin t sin u). And of course (cos t, sin t) goes to (cos t+u, sin t+u) since we have rotated it through an angle t and then through an angle u. And now we're done, because the \"vector addition\" property the original diagram had remains true after rotation, so adding (cos t cos u, cos t sin u) to (- sin t cos u, sin t sin u) has to give you (cos t+u, sin t+u). And that's exactly the addition theorems. (That may be hard to follow with no diagrams, but I think it's easier to follow than the triangle-stacking proof would be without diagrams, and with diagrams everything is pretty transparent.) The right-angled-triangle definitions are traditional because historically trigonometry came before coordinates. But now we have coordinates and generally learn about them before we learn trigonometry, and at that point the point-on-the-unit-circle definitions are simpler, more general, and better suited for proving other things. reply justinpombrio 18 hours agoparentYou phrase this as a disagreement, but in my mind this is complementary. The point of the post is that you should define things in terms of what you care about, and then prove stuff about it. The sum: Sum from n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n / (2n+1)! * x^(2n+1) isn't something you should start with, it should be the punchline. Instead, you should start with angles (the thing you care about), then prove that they behave the same as that sum (what an incredible claim!). The post proposed \"angles of the acute corners of right triangles\" as the starting point. You've argued very well that \"angles in the unit circle relative to (1, 0)\" is a better starting point. Pedagogically, I think it's a wonderful starting point: \"Let's talk about angles. Just angles, nothing else. When you look at angles of actual objects, the side lengths are all different, which complicates matters. Since all we care about is the angle itself, not the side lengths, let's make all side lengths equal to 1.

(When we teach children numbers, we start with the natural numbers and then later introduce negative numbers.)

I was told in school that \"there are no right triangles with such angles, but just imagine that there were\" and was then shown some weird (supposedly suggestive) diagrams. I found this unsatisfying and moreover hard to remember. Of course, you could always just define sin and cos for acute angles only and then extend the definition with trig identities, but that seems rather unmotivated too. reply onedognight 15 hours agoparentprevThe only reason the author’s definition doesn’t apply to larger and smaller angles is that they explicitly considered the anglesInstead of adding two separate angles α and β, we’ll use θ and −θ.

I don't really where to start from it. reply outop 13 hours agorootparentDraw a line of length 1 which makes an angle of p with the positive x axis. The x and y coordinates of a, the point at the end of the line give cos(p) and sin(p). Now think about what happens if you increase p by a tiny bit. a moves tangentially. (This works very similar to how the tangent to a curve gives the change in y for a change in x.) So the vector of cos'(p), sin'(p) is given by a vector starting from a, at a right angle to 0a, and pointing in the positive direction. Since the point a moves through 2pi distance while p goes from 0 to 2pi (the definition of measuring angles in radians) the speed of the point is 1, and so the vector of derivatives has length 1. You can check easily that this makes cos'(p) = -sin(p) and sin'(p) = cos(p). reply gjm11 11 hours agorootparentYup! (If I were trying to present this stuff in a maximally-elegant order without too much regard for what order human brains like to learn things in, the order of things would be: complex numbers, calculus, trigonometry. Then we define something that we might initially call e(t) to satisfy the differential equation de/dt = ie, and observe that having e and e' at right angles means that |e| remains constant, which means that |e'| also remains constant, so if we start with e(0)=1 then we have a point moving at unit speed around the unit circle, etc. Keep the linkage between the geometrical and formal points of view there at all times.

I had the less common experience of learning some graphics programming prior to taking a trig class in school. \"How do I draw a circle?\" You sweep an angle from 0 to 360 (or 2*pi) and use sin() and cos() to get points on the unit circle, then multiply by your radius and plot them. For me the notion of sin and cos being coordinates of points on a unit circle was natural. Later when I had trig class it seemed really weird to define these functions as ratios of sides of a triangle. In particular you never talk about a side length as being negative. So no, it's not universal that the triangle definitions seem more obvious or make more intuitive sense. I think this is important for people to understand.

The height of the line segment from A to the x axis will be the sine of the angle between the ray and the x axis. The length of the line segment from the origin to where your vertical line hits the x axis will be the cosine. Now, draw a tangent line perpendicular to the x axis and find the point B where your ray intersects the tangent line. The length of the segment from the origin to B will be the secant, the length of the segment from B to the x axis will be the tangent.² Finally, draw the tangent line parallel to the x axis and find the intersection of the ray with that line at C. The length of the segment from C to the origin will be the cosecant and the segment from the y axis to C will be the cotangent. You can use your basic trig identities and knowledge of similar triangles to verify the relationships between the functions and the triangles. Angles outside the first quadrant will give signed values that make sense if you consider segments going down or left to be negative (but down and left is positive). ⸻ 1.

I think the author could have just written \"I have found an alternative approach\" instead of \"I have found a better approach\". As others have noted here, the geometric argument only works \"intuitively\" for acute angles and the functions have to be explicitly extended. Still, I hadn't seen this proof of the angle addition formula yet, and I found it neat. From a point of view of formalisation, a power series based approach (either directly or via the complex exp function) as traditionally used is probably better, because going into analysis (especially complex analysis), you're going to need power series anyway.

The sine and cosine of an acute angle are defined in the context of a right triangle: for the specified angle, its sine is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse), and the cosine is the ratio of the length of the adjacent leg to that of the hypotenuse.

Instead, I find that the intuition that's sought is more to start by seeing exp(it) as being a generator of complex rotation---a tremendously beautiful and parsimonious bit of theory---and then seeing sin and cos as being 1-dimensional coordinate projections of that. Then the series definitions are just cute ways of deriving that relationship formally. Circles over triangles. reply isolli 19 hours agoprevMy daughter (in 5th grade) is interested in learning advanced maths, so we looked at sine and cosine. Question: is there an easy, geometrical way to \"show\" that `cos(60º)=1/2` using the intuitive definition based on the trigonometric circle? reply gjm11 19 hours agoparentYes. (I assume that by \"the intuitive definition based on the trigonometric circle\" you mean that (cos t, sin t) is the point at angle t on the unit circle. If you meant something else, then what follows may not be helpful.) APPROACH 1 If you take the point (1,0) and rotate it anticlockwise through 60º about the origin, you get (cos 60º, sin 60º), by definition. Look at the triangle formed by (0,0), (1,0), and (cos 60º, sin 60º). The angle at the (0,0) vertex is 60º. The other two angles are equal because the triangle is isosceles (rotating a line segment doesn't change its length) so they must also be 60º since the angles in a triangle add up to 180º. So now drop a perpendicular from (cos 60º, sin 60º) down to the horizontal side of the triangle; it lands at (cos 60º, 0), so cos 60º is the distance from (0,0) to that point, and 1-cos 60º is the distance from (1,0) to that point. But those distances are the same, by symmetry, and now we're done. APPROACH 2 Draw the unit circle and inscribe a regular hexagon in it with (1,0) as one vertex. Divide it up into six triangles by drawing radii. As above, these are equilateral triangles. So now look at the horizontal separation between the opposite points (-1,0) and (1,0). Obviously the distance is 2 units. But we can split it up a different way: we have a horizontal distance 1-cos 60º from either of those to the next point around the circle, then 1 from that to the next point, then 1-cos 60º back to the opposite point. So 2 = (1-cos 60º)+1+(1-cos 60º) and again we're done. (But I think any proof of this particular thing is going to be basically about equilateral triangles more than it's about circles. It might be easier first to show that for angles between 0 and 90º the trig functions have their \"traditional\" definition in terms of right-angled triangles, and then bisect an equilateral triangle.) reply orlandpm 19 hours agoparentprevYes!

So, 60 deg angle is a piece of an equilateral triangle - finish the whole triangle and see if you get any ideas.

[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronagraph reply dr_orpheus 14 hours agorootparentThe even more extreme version of this JPL has been working on with their Starshade program. Not specifically a cornograph, but same concept of blocking light from a star to look for something more dim, in this case its looking for exoplanets. But it is a much larger scale. A 25 m deployable shade in formation 100 km away with the same level of mm precision. https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/starshade-would-take-formation... Edit: Just to be clear on status of this, Starshade is still in early technology demonstration phase that they can actually build the shade and do the formation maintenance. This is not in full build or slated to launch any time soon. reply _hl_ 16 hours agorootparentprevHuh, very interesting- and counterintuitive that distance matters. If anyone here knows why I’d love to learn more!! EDIT: maybe not so counterintuitive after all: if you scale everything up, you get a higher fidelity sensor and more signal to noise. Same reason telescopes want to be big: to collect more light especially from dim signals. Distance of the occulter then reduces perspective distortion that would eclipse the inner parts of the sensor more than the outer ones. Just my speculation though. reply jsemrau 18 hours agoparentprevWhy did you use cold gas thrusters? reply frederikvs 15 hours agorootparentI'm not familiar enough with the project to answer why specifically cold gas thrusters were chosen. What I can say : if old, proven technology will get the job done, there's a strong preference to use that. When needed to achieve the mission, new technology will be developed - sometimes the whole point of a mission is specifically to develop new technology. In this case, one of the major goals of the mission is to develop formation flying technology. Learn what the pitfalls and the tricky bits are, and make the technology available for future missions. But when the mission can be achieved with old technology - technology with a long record of being used in space, where the problems are known and understood, where we know what works and what causes problems - then the mission will use old technology. If you use newer technology, there's always a risk that you'll hit a new issue, previously unknown. Maybe you can work around it, maybe you can't. But this isn't web development where you can refactor, switch to a new framework and continuous deploy your way out of it. For the hardware, you get one launch and that's it. Why run the risk if you can avoid it? It'd be a shame if the mission can't achieve its primary objective (learning about formation flying) because it chose some new type of thruster, and encountered some new issue with it. reply nuccy 15 hours agorootparentCold gas thrusters are as reliable (because of simplicity - basically just container of pressurised gas and a valve [1]) and as precise in their thrust pulses execution as it can get. Better precision in thrust execution probably only ion engines have but just because of extremely low thrust levels in general (milli-newtons). 1. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster reply dr_orpheus 15 hours agorootparentprevThey need the milli-newton level of thrust control and so need tiny thrusters. Generally the simplicity of the cold gas thrusters in a small package is easy. Yes it is not as efficient, but moving up in efficiency and complexity to catalyzed monopropellant (generally hydrazine) thrusters the thrust ranges are usually > 1N. Same story with any bi-prop thrusters. Certainly electric propulsion has the levels of thrust needed, but then you would need a lot of power for it. And since they are not doing large delta V maneuvers there is less concern about the actual amount of propellant that you need to take with you. reply jsemrau 18 hours agoprevInteresting that they still use cold gas thrusters. Electric propulsion (FEEP) is much more efficient for this kind of maneuver. reply frederikvs 17 hours agoparentFrom what I can see on wikipedia [0] the first FEEP to be used in space was in 2018. Proba-3's implementation phase started in 2014 [1]. The choice of thruster technology was probably made well before that. They wouldn't use a technology that hasn't flown yet, unless it was crucial for the mission. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-emission_electric_propul... [1] https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Techn... reply jsemrau 16 hours agorootparentThat explains a lot actually reply ooterness 18 hours agoparentprevEverything has tradeoffs, and everything depends on use case. The FEEP thrusters I've seen had a hefty power penalty to keep it on standby, and a long warmup time. Cold gas uses more propellant mass per unit impulse, but it can still come out ahead in total size/weight/power. reply dr_orpheus 14 hours agorootparentYep, definitely power is an issue and a trade-off even with low levels of power. The other item is cost. Cold gas thrusters are super cheap and reliable. So the savings in amount of propellant in going to an electric propulsion system is not going to be worth it in the overall program. This is also because the total amount of maneuvering they are doing (in terms of deltaV) is probably not very large. Lots of little maneuvers. This is compared to something where you have large delta V for big maneuvers or continuously overcoming drag in low LEO orbits where the amount of propellant will become a huge design driver. reply jsemrau 17 hours agorootparentprevIs the power penalty really such a big issue anymore? The Enpulsion Nano for example uses 10-15 Watt only on hot standby. reply frederikvs 14 hours agorootparentFrom the article, Proba-3 has 10 thrusters, so that would bring the total to 150 Watt. I don't know the power budget for the satellite, but we can make an educated guess : the occulter is 1.4 meter diameter, or a surface area of 1.54 square meter. That's an upper bound for the surface area of the solar panels - there's nothing sticking out beyond the disk, that would interfere with observations. Solar power at earth is about 1.3kW/sqm, solar panels are maybe 20% to 30% efficient. That puts you in the ballpark of 400 to 600W. 150W on standby would be a pretty big bite out of your power budget. reply visviva 17 hours agoprevThe combination of mm-level precision and a highly elliptical orbit with a very high apogee (60+ kkm) is really impressive. reply bgnn 15 hours agoprevMaybe I'm dumb, but couldn't they just use an umbrella instead of a separate sattelite? reply frederikvs 15 hours agoparentMany observations of the sun's corona just use a disk attached to the telescope, as you're suggesting [0]. However, for Proba-3 they want the disk to be over 100m away from the telescope, which isn't practical. Also, one of the goals of Proba-3 is to develop formation flying technology, because it will be useful for many other missions in the future. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronagraph reply brutusborn 18 hours agoprevDoes anyone else read “formation flying” and instantly think “Kessler syndrome” reply psunavy03 17 hours agoparentNo because it's exactly the opposite. Kessler syndrome results from satellites smashing into each other with high relative velocities. The entire point of formation flying is zeroing out relative velocity. That's how you stay in formation with something. reply brutusborn 17 hours agorootparentI was imagining them flying close-by, so any failure would have a higher chance of causing a cascade. I couldn’t find any info on how close they are, but I imagine it’s too far for this to be an issue. reply psunavy03 7 hours agorootparentIt still doesn't matter according to physics. There's a reason why two NASCAR cars can be going 150+ miles an hour, and yet \"rubbin's racin',\" but a head-on collision at 60 miles an hour will kill you. The two race cars going 151 and 149 mph rub at ~2mph relative velocity, while the head-on collision with the drunk occurs at 120mph relative velocity. And flying formation, be it in space or in the air, by definition involves getting as close to zero relative velocity as possible . . . or else you aren't in formation. reply dotnet00 15 hours agorootparentprevThe article says they're going to be 144 meters apart. A collision of things that are in basically the exact same orbit is also not going to be much of a risk, as the collision would be at a low relative velocity. Collisions between satellites are a kessler syndrome risk because due to differing orbits, the collision velocities can be in km/s, which can spread debris into a wide range of orbits, thus causing the heightened risk of cascading failures. reply frederikvs 16 hours agorootparentprevThe goal is to have them a bit more than 100m apart. During observations they aim to maintain millimeter precision. I'm pretty sure the risk of collision has been analysed to death. I would expect they've analysed what would happen if one or both devices suddenly stop listening to commands, and that even then there's essentially no risk. reply jauntywundrkind 17 hours agoprevSpeaking of razor-sharp formation flying satellites, reminder Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) got the go ahead this year.

There’s a 30-year old dead rabbit in Seven Sisters tube station Published 9 April 2024 by By Ian Mansfield History — 32,748 Comments ↓ For over thirty years, a dead rabbit has hung inside Seven Sisters tube station, and thousands of people walk past it every day without noticing. The dead rabbit is a legacy of an early form of mobile phone technology, albeit one that lasted less than two years before closing down. We need to jump back to 1989, when the government awarded four licenses to operate Telepoint services, with the aim that their lower costs would offer competition to the country’s two mobile networks – Cellnet (now O2) and Vodafone. At a time when the two mobile networks had 500,000 customers between them, it was expected these Telepoint phones would have as many as seven million customers by the middle of the 1990s. Rabbit was created by the Hong-Kong based conglomerate, Hutchison, which didn’t have a license to operate a telepoint service, so they bought one of the four companies that did. However, by the time the company was ready to launch Rabbit to the world, the other three companies — Mercury Callpoint, Ferranti’s Zonephone and BT’s Phonepoint — had already closed down. Rabbit pushed on and, with a huge marketing blitz, finally started appearing in the shops in May 1992. Despite the fact that it could only make calls within 100 yards of a base station and couldn’t receive calls (you could get a pager telling you to call someone) — in theory, it should have been a success. At the time, the two mobile networks were for business people and Yuppies, and were very expensive to use, so even the restrictive Rabbit phones would have an edge as they were much cheaper to make calls on – typically 50p a minute on a basic cellphone tariff vs 20p a minute on Rabbit. And cheaper monthly rentals. The other factor is that the Rabbit phones could also be used at home. Many homes had a cordless phone, but these domestic analogue radio-based cordless phones were large and frankly pretty poor quality, with calls often dropping out. The Rabbit phones came with a home base station and used early digital phone technologies, so the sound quality was considerably better. And the handset was much smaller than the home cordless phone. So, when Rabbit hopped into the shops in May 1992, sales were expected to be brisk, and indeed, they were. Initially. I worked in a shop selling them, and from memory the mobile calling function was only about half the appeal — it was the substantially better home phone function that really appealed to people when they heard about it from friends. Rabbit launched with base stations on shop fronts and lamposts across Manchester and quickly spread, reaching nationwide coverage by late 1993. Then it abruptly closed down. On a day to remember, Friday 5th November, Hutchison Telecom suddenly announced that it was shutting down the Rabbit service. Hutchison Telecom had recently been granted a license to build a full mobile network and wasn’t interested in its old Telepoint based service anymore. Customers who owned a Rabbit phone were given a refund, and a promise of a discount on Hutchison’s replacement, a GSM based mobile phone network — Orange (now EE). The bunny had flopped. The future was Orange. The announcement that Rabbit was closing down sparked something totally unexpected — a surge in sales. Remember how I mentioned that the phones worked at home as a replacement for the clunky cordless phone — well, that wasn’t dependent on the Rabbit base stations, so the handsets would keep on working in the home after the mobile network was shut down. And people really liked the Rabbit phone for their homes. Awkwardly, customers offered a refund had to return the handsets, and many chose not to, while shops were told to return unsold stock to the warehouses, and many chose not to. Hutchison’s attempt to kill the rabbit dead was struggling for life. In the end, shops ran out of rabbit stock, and in December 1993, the Rabbit base stations switched off forever. However, like many items of street furniture, what is installed in haste can take ages to remove at leisure. Unless the location is needed for something else, old signs and clutter can linger on for years, decades even. So, inside Seven Sisters tube station, there’s still a Rabbit base station sitting on the wall, more than 30 years after it last broadcast a radio signal. If you want to find the dead rabbit, just hop down to Seven Sisters tube station’s High Road entrance ticket hall. You can find it right next to the escalators to the Victoria line. There’s also another one, in rather better condition, in the waiting room on platform 7/8 at Watford Junction station.

In which case it would require someone to either completely remove the wiring, or make it safe at the wall with a blank plate box or similar. Probably not worth the hassle or money to do the work, unless part of a wider refurbishment of that area of the station. I suspect that stations have a lot of no longer used wiring that’s been left in place as it would cost more to remove, assuming they knew what it was for in the first place.

As for “The future [i]s Orange”, the v/o artist for that firm’s ads for over 10 years – almost all its life – was Paul Vaughan, one of the top 4 in the trade at the time (the others being Sean Barrett, Andrew Sachs and John Hedges).

But it looks like it lasted a lot longer than the UK variants of this system did. I think this is because the mobile networks were way too costly at first. Kermit was the poor man's mobile.

    "title": "Utilizing Linux Namespaces for Container Isolation",
    "originLink": "https://www.polarsparc.com/xhtml/Containers-1.html",
    "originBody": "PolarSPARC Building a Linux Container using Namespaces :: Part - 1 Bhaskar S 03/13/2020 Overview Ever wondered how Linux Containers worked ??? Currently, Docker is one of the most popular and prevalent container implementations. Containers run on top of the same Operating System kernel, but isolate the application processes running inside them from one another. One of the secret sauces behind containers is Namespaces. A Namespace abstracts global system resources, such as, host names, user IDs, group IDs, process IDs, network ports, etc., in a way that it appears to the processes (within the namespace) as though they have their own isolated instance of the global system resources. One of the primary goals of namespaces is to support the implementation of containers (lightweight virtualization). Currently, in Linux there are 6 types of namespaces - IPC, Network, Mount, PID, User, and UTS. The following are brief descriptions for each of the namespaces: IPC :: This namespace isolates certain interprocess communication (IPC) resources, namely, Message Queues, Semaphores, and Shared Memory Network :: This namespace provides isolation of the system resources associated with networking, such as, Network devices, IP addresses, IP routing tables, /proc/net directory, port numbers, and so on Mount :: This namespace isolates the set of filesystem mount points seen by a group of processes. Processes in different mount namespaces can have different views of the filesystem hierarchy PID :: This namespace isolates the process ID number space. This allows processes in different PID namespaces to have the same PID User :: This namespace isolates the user and group ID number spaces, such that, a process's user and group IDs can be different inside and outside the user namespace UTS :: This namespace isolates two system identifiers â€” the hostname and the domainname. For containers, the UTS namespaces allows each container to have its own hostname and NIS domain name For the demonstration in this article, we will be using the unshare Linux command as well as implement, build, and execute a simple container using golang. Installation and Setup The installation is on a Ubuntu 18.04 LTS based Linux desktop. We will need two commands newuidmap and newgidmap to demonstrate User namespace. For this, we need to install the package uidmap. To install the package uidmap, execute the following command: $ sudo apt install -y uidmap Next, we will need the brctl command to create a bridge network interface. For this, we need to install the package bridge-utils. To install the package bridge-utils, execute the following command: $ sudo apt install -y bridge-utils To develop, build, and execute the simple container in go programming language, we need to install the golang package. To check the version of golang available to install, execute the following command: $ sudo apt-cache policy golang The following would be a typical output: Output.1 golang: Installed: (none) Candidate: 2:1.13~1ubuntu1ppa1~bionic Version table: *** 2:1.13~1ubuntu1ppa1~bionic 500 500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/hnakamur/golang-1.13/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages 500 http://ppa.launchpad.net/hnakamur/golang-1.13/ubuntu bionic/main i386 Packages 100 /var/lib/dpkg/status 2:1.10~4ubuntu1 500 500 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic/main amd64 Packages To install golang, execute the following command: $ sudo apt install -y golang The above installation procedure installs golang from the official Ubuntu repository. Create a directory for developing, building, and running go programs by executing the following commands: $ mkdir $HOME/projects/go $ export GOPATH=$HOME/projects/go We will need one of the popular go packages on netlink for networking. To download the go package, execute the following command: $ go get github.com/vishvananda/netlink Open two Terminal windows - we will refer to them as TA and TB respectively. TB is where we will demonstrate the simple container. We need to download a minimal root filesystem (rootfs) that will be used as the base image for the simple container. For our demonstration, we will choose the latest Ubuntu Base 18.04.4 LTS at the time of this article. We will assume the latest Ubuntu Base is downloaded to the directory $HOME/Downloads. Hands-on with Namespaces UTS Namespace The unshare command executes the specified program with the indicated namespace(s) isolated from the parent process. To display the options for the unshare command, execute the following command in TA: $ unshare -h The following would be a typical output: Output.2 Usage: unshare [options] [ [...]] Run a program with some namespaces unshared from the parent. Options: -m, --mount[=] unshare mounts namespace -u, --uts[=] unshare UTS namespace (hostname etc) -i, --ipc[=] unshare System V IPC namespace -n, --net[=] unshare network namespace -p, --pid[=] unshare pid namespace -U, --user[=] unshare user namespace -C, --cgroup[=] unshare cgroup namespace -f, --fork fork before launching--mount-proc[=] mount proc filesystem first (implies --mount) -r, --map-root-user map current user to root (implies --user) --propagation slave|shared|private|unchanged modify mount propagation in mount namespace -s, --setgroups allow|deny control the setgroups syscall in user namespaces -h, --help display this help -V, --version display version Each process (with [PID]) has associated with it a sub-directory /proc/[PID]/ns that contains one entry for each of the namespaces. To list all the namespaces associated with a process, execute the following command in TA : $ ls -l /proc/$$/ns The following would be a typical output: Output.3 total 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 cgroup -> 'cgroup:[4026531835]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 ipc -> 'ipc:[4026531839]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 mnt -> 'mnt:[4026531840]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 net -> 'net:[4026531993]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 pid -> 'pid:[4026531836]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 20:41 pid_for_children -> 'pid:[4026531836]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 user -> 'user:[4026531837]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 alice alice 0 Mar 7 12:17 uts -> 'uts:[4026531838]' To launch a simple container whose host name is isolated from the parent host name, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo unshare -u /bin/sh The -u option enables the UTS namespace. The command prompt will change to a #. To check the PID of the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # echo $$ The following would be a typical output: Output.4 18872 To list all the namespaces associated with the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # ls -l /proc/$$/ns The following would be a typical output: Output.5 total 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 cgroup -> 'cgroup:[4026531835]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 ipc -> 'ipc:[4026531839]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 mnt -> 'mnt:[4026531840]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 net -> 'net:[4026531993]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 pid -> 'pid:[4026531836]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 pid_for_children -> 'pid:[4026531836]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 user -> 'user:[4026531837]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 12:36 uts -> 'uts:[4026533064]' Comparing Output.5 to Output.3, we see a change in the uts namespace, which is expected and correct. To change the host name of the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # hostname leopard To display the host name of the parent host, execute the following command in TA: $ hostname The following would be a typical output: Output.6 polarsparc To display the host name of the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # hostname The following would be a typical output: Output.7 leopard This demonstrates to us that we have isolated the host name of the simple container from the parent host name. To exit the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # exit Next, we will mimic the above UTS namespace isolation using the following go program: Listing.1 package main import ( \"log\" \"os\" \"os/exec\" \"syscall\" ) func execContainerShell() { log.Printf(\"Ready to exec container shell ...\") if err := syscall.Sethostname([]byte(\"leopard\")); err != nil { panic(err) } const sh = \"/bin/sh\" env := os.Environ() env = append(env, \"PS1=-> \") if err := syscall.Exec(sh, []string{\"\"}, env); err != nil { panic(err) } } func main() { log.Printf(\"Starting process %s with args: %v\", os.Args[0], os.Args) const clone = \"CLONE\" if len(os.Args) > 1 && os.Args[1] == clone { execContainerShell() } log.Printf(\"Ready to run command ...\") cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0], []string{clone}...) cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{ Cloneflags: syscall.CLONE_NEWUTS, } if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil { panic(err) } } The Command function from the exec package allows one to run the specified command (1st parameter) with the supplied arguments (2nd parameter). It returns an instance of the Cmd struct. One can set the standard input (os.Stdin), the standard output os.Stdout, the standard error os.Stderr, and some operating system specific attributes on the returned Cmd instance. In this case, we specify the syscall.CLONE_NEWUTS OS attribute to indicate the command be run in a new UTS namespace. IMPORTANT : When the main process starts, it internally spawns another main process (with the CLONE argument) in a new namespace. It is this spawned main process (running in the new namespace) that is overlayed (syscall.Exec) with the shell command by invoking the function execContainerShell. Create and change to the directory $GOPATH/uts by executing the following commands in TB: $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/uts $ cd $GOPATH/uts Copy the above code into the program file main.go in the current directory. To compile the program file main.go, execute the following command in TB: $ go build main.go To run program main, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo ./main The following would be a typical output: Output.8 2020/03/07 12:49:11 Starting process ./main with args: [./main] 2020/03/07 12:49:11 Ready to run command ... 2020/03/07 12:49:11 Starting process ./main with args: [./main CLONE] 2020/03/07 12:49:11 Ready to exec container shell ... -> The command prompt will change to a ->. To display the host name of the simple container, execute the following command in TB: -> hostname The following would be a typical output: Output.9 leopard To exit the simple container, execute the following command in TB: -> exit SUCCESS !!! We have demonstrated the UTS namespace using both the unshare command and a simple go program. User Namespace Let us layer the User namespace on top of the UTS namespace. To launch a simple container whose user/group IDs as well as the host name are isolated from the parent namespace, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo unshare -uU /bin/sh The -U option enables the User namespace. To display the user ID and group ID in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: $ id The following would be a typical output: Output.10 uid=65534(nobody) gid=65534(nogroup) groups=65534(nogroup) When a User namespace is created, it starts without a mapping for the user/group IDs in the new namespace to the parent user/group IDs. The unmapped user/group ID is assigned the default value of the overflow user/group ID. The default value for the overflow user ID is read from /proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid (which is 65534). Similarly, the default value for the overflow group ID is read from /proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid (which is 65534). To fix the mapping for the user/group ID to the parent user/group ID, exit the simple container by executing the following command in TB: $ exit To re-launch the simple container with the current effective user/group ID mapped to the superuser user/group ID in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo unshare -uUr /bin/sh The -r option enables the mapping of the user/group IDs in the new namespace to the parent namespace user/group IDs. The command prompt will change to a #. To display the user ID and group ID in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # id The following would be a typical output: Output.11 uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) To list all the namespaces associated with the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # ls -l /proc/$$/ns The following would be a typical output: Output.12 total 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 cgroup -> 'cgroup:[4026531835]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 ipc -> 'ipc:[4026531839]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 mnt -> 'mnt:[4026531840]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 net -> 'net:[4026531993]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 pid -> 'pid:[4026531836]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 pid_for_children -> 'pid:[4026531836]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 user -> 'user:[4026532892]' lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Mar 7 13:09 uts -> 'uts:[4026533401]' Comparing Output.12 to Output.3, we see a change in both the uts namespace as well as the user namespace, which is what is expected and correct. To exit the simple container, execute the following command in TB: # exit Next, we will mimic the above UTS and User namespace isolation using the following go program: Listing.2 package main import ( \"log\" \"os\" \"os/exec\" \"syscall\" ) func execContainerShell() { log.Printf(\"Ready to exec container shell ...\") if err := syscall.Sethostname([]byte(\"leopard\")); err != nil { panic(err) } const sh = \"/bin/sh\" env := os.Environ() env = append(env, \"PS1=-> \") if err := syscall.Exec(sh, []string{\"\"}, env); err != nil { panic(err) } } func main() { log.Printf(\"Starting process %s with args: %v\", os.Args[0], os.Args) const clone = \"CLONE\" if len(os.Args) > 1 && os.Args[1] == clone { execContainerShell() os.Exit(0) } log.Printf(\"Ready to run command ...\") cmd := exec.Command(os.Args[0], []string{clone}...) cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr cmd.SysProcAttr = &syscall.SysProcAttr{ Cloneflags: syscall.CLONE_NEWUTSsyscall.CLONE_NEWUSER, UidMappings: []syscall.SysProcIDMap{ {ContainerID: 0, HostID: 0, Size: 1}, }, GidMappings: []syscall.SysProcIDMap{ {ContainerID: 0, HostID: 0, Size: 1}, }, } if err := cmd.Run(); err != nil { panic(err) } } As indicated previously, the Command function returns an instance of the Cmd struct. In this example, we specify the additional syscall.CLONE_NEWUSER OS attribute to indicate the command be run in a new User namespace. In addition, we set the user ID map UidMappings as an array of syscall.SysProcIDMap struct entries, each consisting of the user ID mapping in the container (ContainerID) to the user ID in the host namespace (HostID). In this case, we map the root user ID 0 in the container to the root user ID 0 of the host namespace. Similarly, we set the group ID map GidMappings Create and change to the directory $GOPATH/user by executing the following commands in TB: $ mkdir -p $GOPATH/user $ cd $GOPATH/user Copy the above code into the program file main.go in the current directory. To compile the program file main.go, execute the following command in TB: $ go build main.go To run program main, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo ./main The following would be a typical output: Output.13 2020/03/07 13:17:02 Starting process ./main with args: [./main] 2020/03/07 13:17:02 Ready to run command ... 2020/03/07 13:17:02 Starting process ./main with args: [./main CLONE] 2020/03/07 13:17:02 Ready to exec container shell ... -> The command prompt will change to a ->.

We have demonstrated the combined UTS and User namespaces using both the unshare command and a simple go program. PID Namespace Let us now layer the PID namespace on top of the User namespace and the UTS namespace. To launch a simple container whose process IDs as well as the user/group IDs and the host name are isolated from the parent namespace, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo unshare -uUrpf --mount-proc /bin/sh The -p option enables the PID namespace. The -f option enables spawning (or forking) of new processes in the new namespace. The --mount-proc option mounts the proc filesystem as a private mount at /proc in the new namespace. This means the /proc pseudo directory only shows information only about processes within that PID namespace. ATTENTION Ensure the option -f is *SPECIFIED*. Else will encounter the following error: /bin/sh: 4: Cannot fork The command prompt will change to a #. To display all the processes in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # ps -fu The following would be a typical output: Output.17 USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 1 0.0 0.0 4628 880 pts/1 S 09:08 0:00 /bin/sh root 6 0.0 0.0 37368 3340 pts/1 R+ 09:12 0:00 ps -fu To display all the processes in the parent namespace, execute the following command in TA: $ ps -fu The following would be a typical output: Output.18 USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND polarsparc 8695 0.0 0.0 22840 5424 pts/1 Ss 08:43 0:00 bash polarsparc 8681 0.0 0.0 22708 5096 pts/0 Ss 08:43 0:00 bash polarsparc 9635 0.0 0.0 37368 3364 pts/0 R+ 09:12 0:00 \\_ ps -fu Comparing Output.17 to Output.18, we see the isolation between the new namespace and the parent namespace, which is what is expected and correct.

To launch a simple container whose mount points as well as the process IDs, the user/group IDs, and the host name are isolated from the parent namespace, execute the following command in TB: $ sudo unshare -uUrpfm --mount-proc /bin/sh The -m option enables the Mount namespace.

To list all the mount points in the parent namespace, execute the following command in TA: $ cat /proc/mountssort The following would be a typical output: Output.24 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpu,cpuacct 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,cpuset 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/devices cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,devices 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/freezer cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,freezer 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/hugetlb cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hugetlb 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/memory cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,memory 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/net_cls,net_prio cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,net_cls,net_prio 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,perf_event 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/pids cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,pids 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/rdma cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,rdma 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd cgroup rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,xattr,name=systemd 0 0 cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/unified cgroup2 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,nsdelegate 0 0 configfs /sys/kernel/config configfs rw,relatime 0 0 debugfs /sys/kernel/debug debugfs rw,relatime 0 0 devpts /dev/pts devpts rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000 0 0 /dev/sda1 / ext4 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered 0 0 /dev/sdb1 /home ext4 rw,relatime,data=ordered 0 0 /dev/sdc1 /home/data ext4 rw,relatime,data=ordered 0 0 fusectl /sys/fs/fuse/connections fusectl rw,relatime 0 0 gvfsd-fuse /run/user/1000/gvfs fuse.gvfsd-fuse rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=1000,group_id=1000 0 0 hugetlbfs /dev/hugepages hugetlbfs rw,relatime,pagesize=2M 0 0 mqueue /dev/mqueue mqueue rw,relatime 0 0 proc /proc proc rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 pstore /sys/fs/pstore pstore rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 securityfs /sys/kernel/security securityfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 sysfs /sys sysfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 systemd-1 /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc autofs rw,relatime,fd=25,pgrp=1,timeout=0,minproto=5,maxproto=5,direct,pipe_ino=28210 0 0 tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev 0 0 tmpfs /run/lock tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=5120k 0 0 tmpfs /run tmpfs rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,size=3293620k,mode=755 0 0 tmpfs /run/user/1000 tmpfs rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,size=3293616k,mode=700,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0 tmpfs /sys/fs/cgroup tmpfs ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=755 0 0 udev /dev devtmpfs rw,nosuid,relatime,size=16402556k,nr_inodes=4100639,mode=755 0 0 Now, let us list all the mount points in the new namespace by executing the following command in TB: #

When a new Mount namespace is created, the mount points of the new namespace is a copy of the mount points in the parent's namespace. We will now demonstrate any changes to the new namespace will not affect the parent namespace. To make the mount point / (and its children recursively) to be private to the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # mount --make-rprivate / To recursive bind the mount point rootfs/ to rootfs/ in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # mount --rbind rootfs/ rootfs/ We need the proc filesystem in the new namespace for making changes to mounts. To mount /proc as the proc filesystem proc in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # mount -t proc proc rootfs/proc Next, we need to make rootfs/ the root filesystem in the new namespace and move the parent root filesystem to rootfs/.old_root using the pivot_root command. To do that, execute the following commands in TB: # pivot_root rootfs/ rootfs/.old_root # cd / To list all the file(s) under / in the parent namespace, execute the following command in TA: $ ls -l / The following would be a typical output: Output.26 total 96 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Mar 1 10:58 bin drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Mar 16 21:15 boot drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Sep 13 2019 cdrom drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4560 Mar 21 06:59 dev drwxr-xr-x 163 root root 12288 Mar 20 10:01 etc drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 4096 Sep 13 2019 home lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 33 Mar 16 21:15 initrd.img -> boot/initrd.img-4.15.0-91-generic lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 33 Feb 17 14:08 initrd.img.old -> boot/initrd.img-4.15.0-88-generic drwxr-xr-x 25 root root 4096 Mar 16 13:37 lib drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 29 2019 lib64 drwx------ 2 root root 16384 Sep 13 2019 lost+found drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Nov 10 13:00 media drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 29 2019 mnt drwxr-xr-x 7 root root 4096 Mar 13 08:04 opt dr-xr-xr-x 328 root root 0 Mar 21 06:59 proc drwx------ 9 root root 4096 Feb 23 13:25 root drwxr-xr-x 36 root root 1140 Mar 21 07:04 run drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 12288 Mar 16 13:37 sbin drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 29 2019 srv dr-xr-xr-x 13 root root 0 Mar 21 06:59 sys drwxrwxrwt 20 root root 4096 Mar 21 11:10 tmp drwxr-xr-x 11 root root 4096 Jul 29 2019 usr drwxr-xr-x 11 root root 4096 Jul 29 2019 var lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 30 Mar 16 21:15 vmlinuz -> boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-91-generic lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 30 Feb 17 14:08 vmlinuz.old -> boot/vmlinuz-4.15.0-88-generic To list all the file(s) under / in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # ls -l / The following would be a typical output: Output.27 total 72 drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 bin drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Apr 24 2018 boot drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 dev drwxr-xr-x 29 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 etc drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Apr 24 2018 home drwxr-xr-x 8 nobody nogroup 4096 May 23 2017 lib drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 lib64 drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 media drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 mnt drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 opt dr-xr-xr-x 328 root root 0 Mar 21 14:10 proc drwx------ 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 root drwxr-xr-x 4 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 run drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 sbin drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 srv drwxr-xr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Apr 24 2018 sys drwxrwxr-x 2 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 tmp drwxr-xr-x 10 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:23 usr drwxr-xr-x 11 nobody nogroup 4096 Feb 3 20:24 var Comparing Output.26 and Output.27, we see the root filesystems are totally different. To mount /tmp as the temporary filesystem tmpfs in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp To create a text file /tmp/leopard.txt in the directory /tmp of the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # echo 'leopard' > /tmp/leopard.txt To list the properties of the file /tmp/leopard.txt in the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # ls -l /tmp/leopard.txt The following would be a typical output: Output.28 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 7 Mar 14 22:05 /tmp/leopard.txt To list the properties of the file /tmp/leopard.txt in the parent namespace, execute the following command in TA: $ ls -l /tmp/leopard.txt The following would be a typical output: Output.29 ls: cannot access '/tmp/leopard.txt': No such file or directory Finally, to completely remove the parent root filesystem rootfs/.old_root from the new namespace, execute the following commands in TB: # mount --make-rprivate /.old_root # umount -l /.old_root To list all the mount points in the new namespace by executing the following command in TB : # cat /proc/mountssort The following would be a typical output: Output.30 /dev/sda1 / ext4 rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,data=ordered 0 0 proc /proc proc rw,relatime 0 0 tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,relatime 0 0 To exit the new namespace, execute the following command in TB: # exit SUCCESS !!!

I'm not that mad about it, some censorship is always necessary (you don't want links to child porn), but it's weird that Wikipedia pretends there is no censorship. And it's kind of arbitrary.

It's both bad reply chownie 3 hours agorootparentDo they pretend there's no censorship? I don't see that. They block spam and I'm certain no one objects to that, so the bare fact that they exclude some information clearly does not constitute the status \"censored\" I'd imagine the reason kiwifarms gets different treatment is because the site is a lot worse than the descriptor \"anti-trans doxxing forum\" might make you believe — it's a website designed specifically to facilitate long term stalking and harassment campaigns.

Censorship of official links is against explicit Wikipedia policy[1], but it doesn't matter because every policy can be overridden by consensus.

There's a history of such extensions ending up in the hands of bad actors. Ironic that open-source extensions become obscenely dangerous once you install them from the Chrome store, a platform that's meant to improve security. The store should let you install directly from a repo and that should really be the default distribution mechanism, just as Obsidian does with plugins for example. The store could still monitor said repo for suspicious changes, cautiously roll out new updates, etc. Not to claim open source is perfect (as recent events illustrate), but transparent code is far safer than opening the kimono to a black box. reply caymanjim 4 hours agoparentIt sucks that Chrome's permission model requires \"read and change all data on all sites\" for so many plugins.

Is this some sort of standartisation or should I have left it as is? naming-standards Share Improve this question Follow Follow this question to receive notifications asked Nov 4, 2015 at 10:12 Tolga OzsesTolga Ozses 80711 gold badge66 silver badges77 bronze badges 2 1 All-caps probably had its start in MS-DOS, all lower case probably from unix heritage. Not sure about the capitalised first letter - Mac roots, perhaps. In the end, it doesn't really matter except as a matter of tidiness or style. – Lawrence Nov 4, 2015 at 10:19 6 In this case @Lawrence, I don't think the casing of README files has anything to do with MS-DOS as there was not that sort of development going on. It was UNIX where all this sort of organisation originated and the README files were specifically upper case because it makes them stand out, partly because of all the lower case file names. Naming a file Readme seems lame to me. I'd say that's wrong casing. But it's a convention, so it can't really be \"wrong\". – NeilG Jul 25, 2023 at 23:46 Add a comment4 Answers Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) This answer is useful 66 Save this answer. Show activity on this post. All-uppercase letters stand out and make the file easily visible which makes sense because it is probably the first thing a new user would want to look at. (Or, at least, should have looked at…) As others have already said, file names starting with a capital letter will be listed before lower-case names in ASCIIbetical sorting (LC_COLLATE=C) which helps make the file visible at a first glance. The README file is part of a bunch of files a user of a free software package would normally expect to find. Others are INSTALL (instructions for building and installing the software), AUTHORS (list of contributors), COPYING (license text), HACKING (how to get started for contributing, maybe including a TODO list of starting points), NEWS (recent changes) or ChangeLog (mostly redundant with version control systems). This is what the GNU Coding Standards have to say about the README file. The distribution should contain a file named README with a general overview of the package: the name of the package; the version number of the package, or refer to where in the package the version can be found; a general description of what the package does; a reference to the file INSTALL, which should in turn contain an explanation of the installation procedure; a brief explanation of any unusual top-level directories or files, or other hints for readers to find their way around the source; a reference to the file which contains the copying conditions. The GNU GPL, if used, should be in a file called COPYING. If the GNU LGPL is used, it should be in a file called COPYING.LESSER. Since it is always good to strive for the least surprise of your users, you should follow this convention unless there are compelling reasons for a deviation. In the UNIX world, file name extensions were traditionally used sparingly so the canonical name of the file is README without any suffix. But most users probably would have no troubles understanding that a file named README.txt has the same meaning. If the file is written in Markdown, a file name like README.md might also be reasonable. Avoid using more complicated markup languages like HTML in the README file, however, because it should be convenient to read on a text-only terminal. You can point users to the manual of the software or its on-line documentation, that might be written in a more sophisticated format, for details from the README file.

Show activity on this post. Traditionally the file was called README in uppercase because command-line environments that use alphabetical ordering would then put the file at the top. This makes them easily visible in big directories. It's most likely a holdover from the Unix/Linux world where you would download sources and then build your software. Having files like README and INSTALL at the top of your 'list directory contents' view makes it easier to see that they are there, instead of having to browse the entire contents from a command-line interface. The same basic principle works for github as well (and actually works in GUI interfaces too, come to think of it, so it might still hold merit) By no way a hard rule, but very likely something that everybody is doing as a habit because other projects are doing it. Unless there is some explicit reason NOT to, you should probably use all caps just because you'll see it being used that way in lots of other projects. It's also the default naming Github uses when you create a new repository.

README is usually written in upper case. In this way the ls Unix command placed the file near the beginning of the directory listing (upper-case letters comes before lower-case letters in ASCII ordering).

Which also brought a lot of similar standardized files, as the need came up (LICENSE, COPYING, INSTALL, CONTRIBUTING, etc.). During the sharing, hacking, free software period it was a lot less standard and I saw plenty of alternate casing for README and \"non-standard\" spellings like 00README, Readme_first, etc. When everyone started sharing their open source projects in a standard way (Github and its ilk, along with the rise of CTAN/CPAN-like registries for all kind software) the notion of the standard README got a lot more... standard. reply TachyonicBytes 17 hours agoprevIsn't the urban legend around this that it mimics the \"EAT ME\" and \"DRINK ME\" messages from Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll?

Say, you're connecting to BBS with A LOT of files. Unless you already know that \"SEX459W.ZIP\" and \"SEX454.ZIP\" are Windows and DOS versions of (fictitious) “Super Extractor 4.5”, you'll spend a lot of time figuring it out. People who pay no attention to file categories can also get intrigued without a cause. Therefore, full names and descriptions were stored in sidecar files, and were processed to form complete file listings (to download and study offline). Sometimes operators personally reviewed the software, adding interesting opinions about users who had it on their computers, sometimes those were simple excerpts from release notes. In some cases, the metadata was automatically appended to archives (as standard comments). Later, in the era of Rich Formats, WinZip even allowed arbitrary HTML in ZIP comments, and automatically loaded them into IE frame instead of regular text box when opening such archive. Obviously, that novelty didn't last long. reply therealmocker 7 hours agorootparentYou just sparked a memory of FILE_ID.DIZ, a standard file included in zip archives during the BBS era.

See https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/locale.5.html You can read /usr/share/i18n/locales/iso14651_t1_common as a (very) complex example. But, full disclosure: I have never done it myself. reply arp242 16 hours agorootparentYeah, that's what I tried, but was never able to get that to work.

If you logged into a commercial unix machine in the 90s it would not have autocomplete out of the box. I assumed it was to sort at the top of 'ls' output, which is one of the answers on stack exchange. reply frumbleanglerop 17 hours agorootparentAutocomplete was very common in the 90s — installing bash or tcsh was generally one of the very first things one did on a commercial UNIX that didn’t ship with a decent shell. reply asveikau 16 hours agorootparentI'm having a hard time finding people writing about this, because so many people write about shells from a more recent perspective. According to this, tcsh introduced completion in 1983. https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/l-linux-shells/ Early on it used esc instead of tab. I also found in the bash changelog from 1996 there are fixes to crashing bugs in file name completion. However, I stand by what I said. It was common for people not to know about filename completion. It was common to ship without it by default. Most clued in people installed bash on those systems. But not everybody. reply FabHK 15 hours agoparentprevHow is \"README\" easier to tab-autocomplete than \"Readme\"? reply b0afc375b5 15 hours agoprevI use README.org (emacs).

Back in the 90's shareware scene long before Github, an overwhelming number of files would be downloaded to your computer and then you'd be left to wonder where to start. Making a file all caps draws your attention to it and lets you know where the author intends you to start. Today, Github opens that file for you on the front page of every repo, so it doesn't matter so much anymore. reply pvg 17 hours agoparentprevYes. And even with lowercase, when all you have is ASCII, all caps becomes a reliable/x-platform way to add emphasis.

For the first ~50 years there were competing proprietary instruction sets and software stacks, languages and compilers and operating systems were vendor specific, buggy and mutually incompatible. Compilers were sold separately and expensive, apps were platform specific. x86 would have remained a monopoly if not for a licensing accident with Intel second-sourcing chips from AMD. We're seeing a version of that replaying, with some parts better and some parts worse. The GPU situation would be ripe for regulation to lift GPU software development from the dark ages, but companies who benefit most (NVidia) have probably become too big to regulate. reply jlokier 10 hours agoparentprevI would add WebGL to the mix, for when you need that GPU performance in a browser that doesn't support WebGPU yet.. reply saurik 8 hours agoparentprev> i imagine if i tried to explain to someone the state of modern GPU computing i'd sound like an insane person, why is it so complicated, ugh :( I mean, do you think this is different for anything else in our field?

To be fair there was some kind of support on the PS3 with GL ES 1.0/Cg shaders as secondary API, later dropped, Wii GX(2) shaders are based on GLSL, and while Switch does support GL 4.6 and Vulkan for porting purposes, it is either Nintendo extensions spaghetti time, or rewrite in NVN, for actually taking full advantage of the hardware. reply lelanthran 3 hours agoparentprevYou missed ROCm? reply pixelpoet 17 hours agoprevOpenCL is the best damn compute API ever.

I found it to be much worse than CUDA when I tried to use it years ago. reply softfalcon 16 hours agorootparentHaving used both, it is true that CUDA has the \"enterprise edge\" of being a proprietary, paid for product, backed by an (almost) trillion dollar company. There are features and conveniences in CUDA that aren't present in OpenCL. That being said though, for how little funding, research, and support OpenCL receives, it is an astoundingly capable tool. I don't think it's fair to compare apples and oranges, even if they're clearly both \"fruit\" with a \"high sugar content\". reply pjmlp 16 hours agorootparentIt isn't as if the Intel and AMD enterprises ever managed to produce anything comparable to CUDA tooling. reply seanw444 14 hours agorootparentNvidia has brand recognition and momentum on their side. It's not that Apple or AMD are incapable. reply pjmlp 14 hours agorootparentAMD has more than proven its incapability to provide proper OpenCL tooling during the last 10 years. Apple gave up on OpenCL, after disagreements how Khronos managed it. Metal Compute provides a CUDA like development experience. reply wubrr 16 hours agorootparentprevIn what ways was it better/worse? reply smallmancontrov 15 hours agorootparentprevNVidia's OpenCL was fine, but AMD's OpenCL was an unholy dumpster fire of broken examples, missing error messages, and crashing drivers. reply MaxBarraclough 14 hours agorootparentI used OpenCL a little in 2015. AMD's implementation seemed pretty good, whereas nVidia's was significantly behind. It didn't support OpenCL 1.2, iirc. reply SpecialCoffee 16 hours agoprevCould we get an expert to weigh in on the state of OpenCL. It seems like AMD and Intel are shifting away from OpenCL other GPGPU languages such as ROCm and DPC++. reply pixelpoet 15 hours agoparentNot sure if having two commercial OpenCL apps[0] makes me an expert, but the practical reality is that OpenCL works just great today, even on latest Apple platforms. It's not a lot of work to do a little testing and tuning on the 3 main vendors. News of OpenCL's demise is greatly exaggerated. [0] https://glaretechnologies.com/ reply jsheard 13 hours agorootparentDid you figure out a way to interop OptiX with OpenCL, or do you just not use Nvidias RT acceleration? AFAIK it's not exposed directly through OpenCL. reply joe_the_user 10 hours agorootparentprevWell, my impression when I looked into OpenCl a few years ago was that it was certainly real and used for things but it was absolutely nothing like a Cuda replacement. Basically it's constructs are low level and processor specific - workable for graphic engines but not for general purpose gpu programming. This is explains the rise of ROCm and DPC++ as systems having equivalent higher level constructs to Cuda. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentSYCL is the second attempt at it, because only after got punched, seeing researchers rather adopt CUDA with its polyglot PTX, supporting C++, Fortran, and even subsets of Java, Haskell, .NET, did they come up with SPIR, and OpenCL C++ in OpenCL 2.0. However almost no one cared, meaning AMD and Intel never shiped anything worth using, so OpenCL 3.0 is OpenCL 1.0 rebranded, and out of it, the C++ efforts were placed into SYSCL intead. Which Intel picked up for their own DPC++ efforts, an additional tooling layer on top of SYSCL, meanwhile the only company selling usable SYCL developer experience is a former compiler vendor, that used to work with Sony in high performance compilers for the Playstation (Codeplay), as they pivoted away from console development. Eventually Intel acquired Codeplay, and they are now the main supporters of One API tools, and the whole UXL efforts. In the middle of all this, AMD decided to go with their own efforts. It isn't only up to NVidia, when their competition can't get their story straight for decades. reply rwbt 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat version of OpenCL do Apple platforms support? Also, is OpenCL also deprecated like OpenGL on Apple? reply my123 13 hours agorootparentit's 1.2, macOS only, and marked as deprecated reply VHRanger 13 hours agoparentprevPeople are moving away from OpenCL. The big problem is driver support. The transition from 2 to 3 was a mess, performance is all over the place on some functions between intel/amd/nvidia, and Apple is at the point of just leaving it out. People have even started using Vulkan in its place for some GPGPU, because at least Vulkan has good drivers everywhere, being a low-level API. reply keldaris 12 hours agorootparentWhile this is completely true, it is also true that OpenCL 1.2 is the one compute API that just works on every major platform and the drivers don't seem that unusably bad (though I'm not claiming experience of every platform here, just Nvidia on Windows/Linux and Apple Silicon on MacOS). Writing a limited dialect of C and sticking to 1.2 limitations is far from ideal, but it does at least work reliably. Sadly, that is more than can be said about most competitors. reply VHRanger 11 hours agorootparentYes, 1.2 is OK. The problem is that the drivers are merely OK. Presumably if you're using OpenCL you care about the performance (otherwise why would you??) and since that's the case, it's the best on no platforms, and there are alternatives for any set of platforms that do better. I think OpenCL is sadly on its way out, and it's mostly Apple's fault (and Nvidia a little). Vulkan compute is much more interesting if you're looking to leverage iGPUs/mobile/other random CPUs. If you're targetting workstations/server workloads only, it makes sense to restrict yourself to a subset of accelerator types and code for that (eg. Torch or JAX for GPUs, use highway for SIMD, etc.) reply keldaris 10 hours agorootparentIt depends on what you're doing. For writing FP32 number crunching code from scratch (meaning you don't care about something like Torch, or even cuBLAS/cuDNN), I haven't encountered cases where I couldn't match CUDA performance and if I did, I could always just use a bit of PTX assembly where absolutely necessary (which OpenCL lets you do, whereas Vulkan does not). This also gets me good performance on MacOS without rewriting the whole thing in Metal. There is no native FP16 support and there are other limitations that may matter to your usecase or be completely irrelevant. I'm definitely not saying OpenCL is any sort of a reasonable default for cross platform GPGPU work. In truth, I don't think there is any reasonable \"general\" default for that sort of thing. Vulkan has its own issues (only works via a compatibility layer on MacOS, implementation quality varies widely, extension hell, boilerplate hell, some low level things are just impossible, etc.) and everything else is a higher level approach that can't work for everything by definition. It's a pretty sad situation overall and every solution has severe tradeoffs. Personally, I just write CUDA when I can get away with it and try to stick to OpenCL otherwise, but everyone needs to make that choice for their own set of tradeoffs. reply VHRanger 8 hours agorootparentYeah, TBH I'm kind of sad about where OpenCL ended up, because it \"should have\" been what CUDA was used for from 2011-2021. AlexNet, TF, Pytorch, etc. \"should have\" been written with OpenCL backends. But the driver implementations inconsistency, version support issues, etc. meant people used CUDA instead. I agree Vulkan has its own issues, and having written some MoltenVK stuff, you clearly know the quality-of-life pains in developping with it. That said, at least from the user side it works and performs well. reply pjmlp 3 hours agorootparentprevIt is Intel, AMD and Google's fault for never supporting OpenCL as they should, and Khronos for pissing off Apple with how they took ownership of OpenCL. reply pjmlp 15 hours agoparentprevDPC++ is Intel's own thing on top of SYCL, which relies on OpenCL drivers, basically long story short, what happened after Khronos realized shipping source code and C99 dialect wasn't really what most researchers were keen on using for their work. reply pvg 15 hours agoprevA thread from 2020: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22492902 reply lenerdenator 16 hours agoprevI'm excited for what processors and software look like in 5-10 years.
