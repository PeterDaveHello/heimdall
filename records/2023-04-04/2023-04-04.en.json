        "content": "Mullvad VPN and the Tor Project have collaborated to create the Mullvad Browser, a privacy-focused web browser aimed at reducing mass surveillance by minimizing tracking and fingerprinting. Using a VPN alone is not enough to achieve perfect privacy, but the Mullvad Browser combined with a VPN provides an alternative to browse the internet with more privacy. Mullvad already being a Mozilla partner for their branded VPN, and the Mullvad Browser is open source and free of charge. Skeptical comments have been made about issues with using Mullvad VPN for bypassing geo-blocking, and other providers' IPs being less risky to use for certain activities.VPN providers acquire new IP addresses from time to time to support streaming services, but the connection still goes through a data center. Proxy market caters to data scraping developers and criminals who perform criminal activities. Annoyance due to only being able to access iPlayer from abroad via a VPN. Paying a form of a license fee could be a revenue stream for the BBC, but they might have licensing issues. The BBC is missing out on serving international customers through its streaming services. Pirate streaming sites offer more reliable solutions for access to the BBC. BBC previously\u00a0blocked a streaming service partnership called Kangaroo, but it is now available run under Britbox. Legal providers make it hard for innocent people to access UK shows.\u00a0One solution to the legal issue is paying for BritBox on Amazon.Users recommend privacy-respecting browsers like Librewolf and Arkenfox, but some complain about site compatibility issues. Mullvad, a no-logging VPN provider, is praised for its seamless, pay-per-use model and growing revenue despite competition from better-known (but less trustworthy) brands like NordVPN. A user suggests marketing is a major factor in brand popularity. A reader looking for a privacy-respecting Firefox alternative might find Librewolf or Mull to be good options.Mullvad is an open-source VPN client that supports obfuscation schemes and can bypass websites that block VPNs; the desktop version is better than the smartphone app. Firefox has weaker sandboxing and lacks support for isolating sites on Android, but is better for privacy and control than Chrome. Mullvad is committed to open source and is even used by Mozilla VPN. A Firefox fork called Tor browser with Mullvad VPN support is available but may have outdated settings for fingerprinting protection. Tor browser updates often the same day as Firefox releases.Mullvad, a VPN provider known for its dedication to privacy, has released its own browser. The browser features letterboxing technology that combat fingerprinting by spoofing users' timezone and window size. It also doesn't allow users to keep logged in to specific websites between sessions to combat tracking. The browser has a minimalistic design and can help prevent ad trackers and browser fingerprinting, but may be inconvenient for some users. It's not clear whether the browser has a set list of supported common resolutions or \"snapped\" grid sizes.The Mullvad Browser is a privacy-focused browser that intentionally spoofs timezone and browser fingerprinting to protect online privacy, similar to the Tor browser. The browser's goal is to protect against online tracking and unnecessary data collection by websites, and such efforts are important as people with a luxury of uncorrupt and democratic governmental representation should still act with caution. Online privacy issues impact the less privileged disproportionately, and protecting privacy can benefit everyone in the long run. This is not just about ads but also about data that can be used for malicious reasons such as tracking abortions and fertility issues which can be used to leverage law adjustments. While some express skepticism about the browser, it is still a good option for those who prioritize privacy.Mullvad has released a privacy-focused browser that can be used with, but doesn't require, their VPN; it includes NoScript and Mullvad DoH, and has been made available for free to combat fingerprinting. However, it is possible to surf without VPN and potentially reveal an IP address. Several commenters question the placement of NoScript and whether it's a \"mistake,\" and recommend the use of Mullvad's desktop VPN software for system-wide protection. There is also debate over the efficacy of the split tunnel and fingerprinting and concerns about the pool of people using Mullvad's browser for anonymity. Some recommend sticking with (or switching to) other privacy-focused browsers like LibreWolf due to resource allocation concerns.Mullvad has launched a privacy-focused web browser, developed in collaboration with the Tor Project, to minimize tracking and fingerprinting. The Mullvad Browser is designed for use with or without the Tor Network, and features a search engine front-end to the Google Search API. The browser also bundles an extension that allows for SOCKS5 connection. Developed for users concerned about how their data is being tracked and shared online, Mullvad is one of many companies offering VPN services to safeguard privacy. However, users are recommended to implement other privacy and security measures to ensure their safety online.The Mullvad Browser has been released, and it is a Firefox-based product. The browser is aligned with Mullvad's VPN ethos, and there are many features that users will appreciate. The browser has a built-in kill switch and ad-blocker for added privacy, and it uses Mullvad's DNS over HTTPS by default. Mullvad Browser allows users to assign specific proxies to individual containers, which enable nice tab segregation, and although it needs fine-tuning, it is another exciting product from Mullvad.The post discusses browser fingerprinting and how to prevent it, including testing various browser leak tests and using browser tweaks. The author notes that private browsers should have a unique color/background in the menubar to indicate when to quit the browser or click the 'new identity' menu button. Some users suggest that a VPN provider or techniques to randomize the unique fingerprint can help to avoid being tracked. However, fingerprinting is a lot more than just testing on a bunch of sites, and websites want to identify users or bots. So, applying simple browser tweaks can prevent low-hanging fruit.",

There is discussion about the song choices and the JS ecosystem. The creator is considering making a video about the development process.The Tech Times has reported on a video featuring creative coding and shader-based animation by IQ, author of ShaderToy. The video is a great resource to learn about webGL, develop animation, and use shader techniques. The post has sparked a discussion among users about other resources for learning about webGL, including documentation, paid courses, and free online sources like threejs.org and blender geometry nodes. Users expressed their admiration for the artistry and complexity of the video, as well as their difficulties with aligning text and GUI components in the web browser. A few users also discussed the appropriateness of the album name \"Unknown Pleasures\" for a work laptop. Finally, users praised the author of the video for creating such an inspiring work, which prompts the author to consider creating a tutorial on how to make such videos.A web developer has created an interactive Javascript demo called \u201cUnknown Pleasures\u201d. The demo uses WebGL and only a few lines of shader code, with web-based 3D graphics library WebGPU, three.js, and is available on GitHub. Users said it reminded them of Ro.me and the animated sitcom Regular Show. The creator hopes it will be easy to integrate into more sophisticated work, and it appears to be working on most phones. However, users have reported difficulty opening it in some browsers.",

        "content": "Tesla has removed front and rear parking sensors in the Model 3 and Model Y in a bid to improve shareholder profits, replacing them with cameras, which some argue is unreliable and may harm sales. Some readers argue that relying solely on computer vision without sensor fusion is risky in critical safety systems. Tesla has received criticism for removing safety features in the past, and some argue that the company's all-in approach may create more problems than it solves. Experts suggest that Tesla's technology is behind its competitors, and the lack of certain features, such as traffic light communication, may be a disadvantage. Some Hacker News users discuss the usability and features of electric cars, including specific models and potential benefits. Tesla has also begun using 48V wiring in their cars, with mixed opinions on the success of the switch. Additionally, discussions on preparing for off-grid situations and the dangers of gasoline arise in some comments.According to the Hacker News community, Tesla is the best car manufacturer among its poor-performing competitors, mainly due to its superior driving experience and innovative SuperCharger network. Despite some cost-cutting measures, including the recent removal of parking sensors from their Model 3, Tesla's market cap remains high, and it remains the leader in global EV sales. Legacy automakers have begun to catch up, but their production issues and profit loss hinder their ability to directly compete with Tesla.

        "content": "Midjourney, an AI image generator, is exempting China's president, Xi Jinping, from political satire while retaining access to users in China. Founder and CEO, David Holz, states that \"political satire in China is pretty not-okay\" and that preserving the ability for Chinese citizens to use the tech was more important than generating satire. This signals a threat to free expression as individual countries' censorship laws, particularly those of powerful countries such as China, are setting global rules enforced by tech companies. Foreign companies are enabling China's restrictive policies on political speech.Midjourney, an AI image generator platform, received backlash from users after its CEO, David Holz, stated that \"political satire in China is pretty not okay,\" and removed the option to generate an image of China's President, Xi Jinping. The move has raised concerns over censorship and acquiescence to authoritarian regimes. Holz's comment about China's political satire contradicts the company's tagline, \"Create anything.\" Some users also criticized the company's decision to move to a pay-to-play model and the company's limited free credit system.Midjourney, a social media platform for creative collaborations, has been accused of silencing satire about Chinese President Xi Jinping by blocking ridiculing prompts. CEO David Holz reportedly believes that mocking such political figures is \"taboo\" and blocked them to ensure a welcoming environment for Chinese collaborators. While many accuse Midjourney of caving to China's authoritarian regime, others suggest that it's a hard choice and it's better\u00a0to operate within the law of nations it functions in; primarily being China. Midjourney also doesn't allow pornography, resulting in users sharing and discussing art that isn't necessarily pictures of women.Midjourney, an AI tool that allows users to make satirical art, is facing criticism over its decision to geo-block content in China. Critics argue that it raises concerns about free speech, and that companies should not operate in totalitarian states. Others say that the company is free to choose what content it hosts and that people can choose to use it or not. Commenters also discussed political satire in different cultures, the use of AI, and the limits of free speech. There are concerns that AI could potentially exacerbate existing political disputes and empower or disempower certain groups of people.Google's model generating realistic images is criticized for being expensive and closed source. The company faces calls to make it more affordable or open source it entirely. While Google tries to stay politically neutral, its service has limitations that appear to be censoring content related to Xi Jinping. Some point out that this censorship could be a slippery slope to further censorship of topics, likening it to China's history of censoring content. The decision to avoid overtly political topics may be unrealistic in a world where business interests and politics can't be entirely separated.Midjourney, an AI-generated content startup, has recently announced that it will no longer allow users to generate satirical content involving Chinese president Xi Jinping on its platform. The company claims that it wants to create a welcoming platform for everyone to collaborate and is aiming to expand into China. However, critics argue that this is bowing down to Chinese censorship and is distracting from the more significant issue of political free expression. The conversation in the comments section veers off into discussions about pornography and censorship, but some users agree this move is unfortunate.The CEO of OpenAI has faced criticism after stating that the platform refuses porn but not political content for the Chinese market. The ability to generate satire is hampered by the policy, which has led to fierce debate amongst tech journalists. Critics have accused OpenAI of bowing to authoritarian control for the sake of the Chinese market, and not taking a stand for free speech. This self-censorship is helping to spread authoritarian ideology, with self-censorship being one of the methods by which it is maintained and spread. Meanwhile, some users have expressed surprise at discovering that Leap Motion founder David Holz was OpenAI's first employee.The compensation for work within a system depends on the price that can be charged for moving within its framework, revealing whether rule of law exists. Low pay for such work could mean a lack of rule of law or criteria for punishment outside of the law. Chinese companies have access to Western markets while Western companies' access in China is limited there is little reciprocity. Companies have the right to run their business, but it is also reasonable to criticize them for their policies from the standpoint of free speech or sovereignty. Authoritarian regimes can manipulate and control the spread of information, making knowledge-sharing tools like LLMs ineffective in toppling a political system.Proxies exist to bypass China's great firewall, but they're not worth the risk for most people, who value their lives. However, a black market for speech may be a solution to overcome censorship, with Bitcoin being an option for small enough transactions. Companies prioritizing profit over principles raises questions on whether the CEO can apply his principles to the company. While some believe that only business matters, using Beijing's attempts to clone their technology can prompt innovation and incentivize unfairly advantaging their competition. The power of propaganda has not diminished, even in countries with liberalization, free trade, and free speech.Midjourney's censorship of political satire to appease China's government highlights the conflict between business interests and morals. While some argue that corporations' responsibility lies solely in maximizing profit, others believe that corporations should prioritize stakeholders such as employees and society. Midjourney's restrictions on political satire affect all users, not just those in China, leading to concerns about compromise in principles. Some feel that the company's greed is behind the decision to cater to China's market, while others argue that regulations and norms differ in every society.Midjourney, a generative AI platform, is facing criticism for censoring its users globally, including blocking content that would be deemed against \u201cmedia standards\u201d in the US. This comes as it was revealed that the platform bans certain terms, including Muhammad, Satire on June 4th, 1989, and COVID and Wuhan, raising concerns about censorship and compliance with authoritarian regimes. The controversy underscores the need for fully open-source tools that allow creative expression and are not beholden to the demands of governments or corporations.Banning TikTok could suppress speech critical to the Chinese Communist Party more than banning Midjourney as the ban would be outside of China and speech critical of the CCP is only effective if it reaches inside of China. Although Midjourney bans Xi Jinping satire everywhere, inside and outside of China. The majority of countries are not democratically governed, hence criticizing flawed democracies is easier as the risk of disappearing is lower. The desirable outcome is to have principled arguments competing in the marketplace of ideas rather than state actors. China can access data from TikTok whenever it wants, making it different from success campaigning for selective censorship. Applications are open for YC Summer 2023.",

        "content": "Apple is reported to have suspended production of its M2 chips at the start of 2023, following a decline in demand for its Macbooks, which prompted a complete halt in global production. Apple's M2 processors power the new MacBook Pro, the Mac mini models, the latest MacBook Air, and were produced by TSMC, which completely stopped sending 5 nano-process M2 chip wafer workpieces to the outsourced semiconductor package test in both January and February, affecting Amkor Technology Korean's packaging work. Despite a 5% YoY revenue decline in Q1 2023, CEO Tim Cook admits that Apple's strategically well-positioned with Apple silicon.General Motors will phase out Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its vehicles starting this year, shifting to a built-in infotainment system co-developed with Google. Engineer Ken Pillonel has added wires and a USB-C connector to a set of AirPods, bypassing the need for its charging case. Apple CEO Tim Cook has seemingly teased the company's upcoming mixed-reality headset in an extensive interview with GQ. Apple halted M2 chip production in January amid 'plummeting' Mac sales.A discussion on measuring xenophobia leads to a debate on diversity, racism, and the effects of migration. The possibility of raising living standards at the source of migration is suggested, but the political will to do so is lacking. Biden's policy on addressing the root causes of migration in Central America is criticized as relatively insignificant, and the US's unwillingness to leverage political muscle is raised. The US is compared favorably to Western Europe regarding immigration, particularly for skilled workers, though opposition to immigration is still present. Some immigrant groups in the US have economically assimilated, while others have not.A discussion on the largest immigrant groups led to a debate on the quality of life and healthcare in various countries. One user claimed that Turks in Germany were the largest immigrant group, while another countered with the statistic that Hispanics are the largest minority group in the US. A few users shared their experiences with healthcare in the US and other countries, with one person arguing that US healthcare is better than many European countries. However, others disagreed and highlighted issues with access and bureaucracy.Healthcare in the US is worse for 90% of the population than other countries. Some states have strict requirements to qualify for Medicaid. Firearms are the leading cause of death for American children. The US has a middle-class healthcare system that makes it harder to quit your job. Some countries in Europe have similar fertility rates to the US. Implementing policies like affordable housing, free education, and healthcare could increase birth rates.Sweden's immigration and higher birth rates are above EU average, though its population is too small to significantly impact Europe's demographics. Peter Zeihan's argument on birth rates and demographics is contentious but highlights the importance of age distribution in determining currency value and economic stability. Declining birth rates could help reach emission targets but may also exacerbate economic problems unless labor is imported or automation is implemented. Immigrants are often seen as valuable workers and buyers in capitalist societies but can also face mistreatment and vilification. The US has a fraught history with immigration and abuse, though legal immigration has continued during recent administrations. Trump's H1B reform aimed to pay immigrants more.The US accepts immigrants regardless of education/skills merit, while countries like Canada and Australia require an advanced degree. America's culture is portrayed as willing to accommodate newcomers. However, there is some truth to lower-class Americans working multiple jobs and being burdened by debt, leading to health problems. The number of working hours in America has reduced significantly in a year and is currently at 34.5 hours. There is talk of cryptocurrency replacing fiat currency, but every fiat currency is technically imaginary. This post is about Apple halting M2 production in January, leading to reduced mac sales.Despite the strong currency, US companies are gaining market shares in all high-value goods, leading to a higher quality of life for US consumers. The GDP per capita of EU members is worse than the poorest US states, which is surprising. Net exporting nations such as BRICS should be worried about more dollar weakness as they need dollars to buy imports. While a currency pact using Yuan won't help much, Bitcoin is probably a better reserve in the long run. Despite talk of a looming downturn/recession, some believe US economic dominance is about to go into hyperdrive due to its lead in AI and thousands of AI startups. American hegemony and global financial and cultural dominance are expected to continue.Despite discussions around hyper political issues and challenges, American productivity, innovation, efficiency, energy, and food appear to be growing, leading many to believe the American Empire is just starting, not ending. Some speculate this transition could be from a republic to an empire, or what Niccolo Soldo calls \"Turbo America.\" Apple products' high prices that are set in USD, then converted, have led to declines in sales, but some argue that adjusting prices to purchasing power could help Apple regain sales without sacrificing margins.Apple's pricing strategy may be a problem due to a lack of margin sacrifice, but it has not hurt shareholders. The M1 line is still insanely good, which leads many users to choose a used M1 instead of buying a new M2. Upgrading to the M2 is minor, making it hard to justify the premium price. Apple already dominates the profit in computer sales, so they do not have much incentive to reduce their margins and take on more support responsibility. In addition, the M-line of architecture is a strategic opportunity that Apple may have missed. Apple's products must be profitable at the current very strong USD valuation, but if some countries were selling Apple products at a cheaper USD conversion than in the US, it could lead to a massive reselling problem. However, geo-locking a laptop in the modern world is impractical and would have its PR issues.The prices of MacBooks in Europe are very high, despite having low RAM and SSD. Customers argue that Apple is cutting corners in search of product segmentation and profit. While the MacBook Air may be sufficient for general use, professionals prefer the MacBook Pro with at least 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD. However, there has been no change in the fan noise or heat with the new M1 or M2 CPUs. Apple's profits are increasing as the MacBook remains a luxury purchase for most people.Windows laptop users debate the new minimum requirement for RAM, with some stating that 16GB is the new minimum, while others argue that 8GB is still sufficient. One user even mentions using a laptop with 128GB of RAM. The debate continues with different use cases, such as software development and video editing, impacting the necessary amount of RAM. Modern OSes are noted for their excellent RAM management.Comments on an article about RAM upgrades and prices for Apple's MacBook Pro models. Many commenters express frustration with the high cost of RAM upgrades and argue that even the base model should come with more than 8GB of RAM. Some compare the high prices to pure profit for Apple. A few also mention their experiences with Windows and RAM usage. However, a couple of commenters defend the 8GB base model as perfectly suitable for everyday use. One commenter notes the value of a cheaper Lenovo laptop with more RAM and a dedicated graphics card.A user praises the performance and responsiveness of the M1 and M1 ultra based MacBook Pros. Despite a comment noting that it's more about OS scheduling and user space software, the user praises the battery life and general performance of Apple laptops. However, some find the pricing unreasonable and components restricted, such as the troubling inability to upgrade the 256GB SSD. Others mention that a laptop with high resilience and good components is worth paying for, especially for businesses. An independent team with former Apple M1 team members may bring comparable performance-per-watt to PC OEM Arm Windows/Linux laptops in 2024. Overall, some users state that the price is justified for the quality features that the MacBook Pro offers.A user experiences extreme lagginess when launching docker and running a service on an M2 MacBook Air, prompting them to switch to their own computer. Other users comment on the cost of the laptop, with some expressing shock at the 200\u20ac cost of adding 8GB more RAM and others noting the high prices of MacBooks in Europe due to VAT. A few suggest getting a used M1 MacBook instead, while others push back on predictions that the M2 will be unusable in a few years.",

        "content": "OutSail Shipping is creating sails the size of a 747 that roll up into a shipping container to reduce fuel consumption for cargo ships, with an array of these devices reducing fuel usage by up to 20%. The sails generate thrust from the wind, with no interference to cargo operations, and can be installed on any cargo ship in port, with a tape measure-like design. Wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) devices such as these can improve a ship's Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) rating without reducing speed or changing the route, and without costly retrofits.A team is experimenting with using a 55-meter-tall wing sail made of steel and supported by the shipping containers to reduce carbon emissions from shipping. The wing sail is dependent on the container load path and uses a symmetric airfoil with fixed ribs inside for strength. The successful implementation of the project depends on models using textile or steel, sensors throughout the wing, and the ability to actively adjust the leeward and windward skins. There are technical problems to solve, but the fundamental physics works to decarbonize shipping rapidly. The team plans to start hiring.Outsail has designed a shipping container that converts into a detachable wind power unit for use on ocean-going vessels, which can save up to 30% of fuel costs, according to the company. Outsail claims the technology is scalable for use on a range of shipping lines, and is planning to have it commercially available by 2022. The business was the winner of TechCrunch Disrupt 2020. The sails can be furled and unfurled with ease in rough seas, while there are programs in place to prevent the wings from over-stressing the connections. Further software is expected to be developed to help vessels best leverage the technology.A Y Combinator startup called B9 Shipping is developing a cargo ship fitted with wings capable of harnessing wind power to increase the vessel's efficiency. While the technology is not new, previous designs have been unsuccessful due to the need for skilled personnel to manage the sails, as well as the cargo companies' unwillingness to pay for the extra crew. B9 Shipping, however, plans to leverage modern automation processes to manage the rigging, but recognizes that the challenge is to design a self-managing sail that can operate safely. The new design will use tall, composite wings fitted to the container vessel segments.US-based tech company Boundless Ocean Sailing Technologies has developed \"smart sails\" for cargo ships that use sensors and algorithms, allowing ships to detect wind speed and strength and adjust sails accordingly. The sails are expected to accommodate requirements for environmentally friendly transport, reducing fuel consumption up to 30%. Traditional sails can still produce forward thrust as long as the wind is at least 20 degrees off from directly in front of the vessel. SkySails and other companies have already tried kite-based solutions, and AirSeas has developed a similar product named the SeaWing.A new start-up, OutSail, is attempting to package sails into 'inter-modal container form-factor\" for cargo ships to reduce emissions. The company has figured out how to make a rigid sail without a mast and design a 60m long sail that can be rolled up into a small package. They have created a bench model and are working on a detailed design to test the sail on the water. While some have suggested nuclear-powered ships, such vessels are seen as uneconomical and potentially risky. Shipping is responsible for an estimated 3% of anthropogenic carbon emissions.OutSail is developing a containerized, retractable sail system that utilizes tape-spring rollers to store sail material, allowing for wider sails, load spreaders to reduce the compression load on any one stack, and tethers deployed to the main deck to provide additional tension restraints; the company is looking to target Panamax vessels for the system as they can help to handle the roll moment from the sails. The team is also considering technologies to detect high wind speeds several kilometers from the vessel to reef or feather sails when wind gusts exceed structural limits. Retrofitting is expected to be required to install the system onto existing fleets.Outsail, a technology start-up plant to install autonomous sails on container ships to reduce the use of bunker fuel by around 20 percent. The sails are expected to work with any size of container ships and do not require permanent changes to the ship. Outsail will need 15 sails to save 20% of fuel on a 4000 TEU vessel travelling across the Atlantic or Pacific. The sails are externally powered by an internal battery pack, charged by wind turbines or solar panels, and Mirage sail's large container can provide 400kW of power. A Mirage sail has an annual revenue floor of $190,895.CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels have positive externalities such as creating fertilisers, producing cement, steel, and plastic, and enabling heavy machinery work, freeing people to work on other things. Taxation can reduce carbon fuel usage, but the simplest way to decrease CO2 emissions is to reduce the amount of oil, coal, and gas dug up and burned. Increasing the cost of burning carbon will drive less use of it in a market economy. Eliminating externalities and using less carbon-based fuel is necessary to reduce carbon emissions. Ships cannot pull enormous solar arrays due to drag, but freestanding rigs exist that can deploy sails without conventional rigging.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35424678",
        "content": "Alibaba has announced it will break up into six independent business units, a move which may pre-empt regulators' intervention, or indicate the company's confidence in the end of the tech crackdown. The new units include e-commerce, separate ones for cloud computing and artificial intelligence, logistics, local services and an international unit. After this reorganisation, e-commerce will remain by far the largest unit, accounting for nearly 70% of revenue. Each unit may raise capital separately through initial public offerings. Investors reacted positively to the news, with Alibaba's share price jumping by 14% following the announcement.Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's public comments about the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were likely the reason for his disappearance, as the CCP controls all branches of government, law enforcement, and the military and is accountable to no one. Losing a power struggle under the CCP could lead to a range of consequences with no recourse. There are two main factions in China- the Beijing faction and Shanghai faction; the latter is more capitalist, and the former is more authoritarian, and multiple sub-factions exist around different CCP leaders. The risks of losing a power struggle in a democracy with rule of law, separation of powers, an independent court system, and regular elections, such as the US, are significantly less than in the CCP.The alleged cluelessness of Jack Ma's actions may be related to China's obsession with face, but some Western cultures value bluntness over face. However, power and control may be a bigger factor in the Communist Party's treatment of Ma and the tech industry in general. Elon Musk's lack of emotional intelligence on Twitter may be due to his apathy about the platform, rather than ineptitude. It is possible that Musk's political behavior stems from his narcissism and recent personal troubles.The CCP crackdown on Alibaba has led to discussions on why the government intervened, and the possibility of easing up in the future; there is seemingly a concern that AI technology advancements in the US could lead to China losing its strategic position, while political control and periodic purges will continue to be a feature of Communist regimes. People believe Elon Musk\u2019s success is based on his selling image rather than technical expertise, and there are likely other unsung \u201cElon Musks\u201d out there; Twitter has been criticized, and Musk's technical interviews have come to question. Finally, the return of Jack Ma as reported by Reuters raises discussion about Chinese government control and private sector fears.Recent moves by the Chinese government, such as easing regulations and approving new video game titles, have given the tech industry cause for hope. However, investors should not forget that China's government is not a monolith, and different factions may disagree on tech policy. China has a long history of keeping merchant power in check, and this recent crackdown may be an extension of that ethos. Nevertheless, investors need to understand and vet their risks carefully.China's government enforces stricter regulations on Alibaba and other companies, potentially setting an example for future crackdowns. The move comes amid a declining Chinese population and a shift away from an exploitative model of capitalism. The US government and corporations have a blurred line with individuals frequently moving between them, but China's approach is distinct. The relationship between corporations and governments can be viewed as competing elites vying for power, money, and influence by often collaborating on shared interests. However, it's not always clear if the Chinese government's decisions are solely self-serving.China's government, notably subordinate to the Communist Party, cannot accept challenges to its laws and policies or anything that threatens its internal cohesion and power. The country's public debt situation is unclear, with State-Owned Enterprises' debt raising doubts about whether it should be considered public or private debt. While the US frequently blocks mergers, China's breakup of Alibaba is viewed differently since it's not aimed at fighting a monopoly but rather avoids a business empire becoming too influential. Contrastingly, China's act also indicates its absence of an independent apex court or rule of law, typical of authoritarian regimes.Alibaba will be leaving behind the conglomerate model, splitting into 6 units, to increase efficiency and competition. Some individuals are discussing the possibility of breaking up other major tech companies in the US, such as Alphabet, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, due to monopolistic behavior. Others are pointing out that dividing Apple's hardware and software would benefit market competition, while some believe Apple's unique hardware and software integration should remain as is. Lastly, commenters bring attention to China's strict laws, which have increased censorship and control over what individuals read, say, and share online, and some are discussing the idea of China moving towards the Korean \"chaebol\" model with complex organizational structures.The article discusses Apple's potential monopolistic behavior, which is not limited to controlling the entire market. While they have a monopoly on their products, there are plenty of non-Apple products to buy. However, some argue that their behavior is still monopolistic and harmful. The argument shifts to whether Apple's monopolistic behavior has produced any good, but it's orthogonal to the underlying question. The comments digress from the topic at times but bring up important points about walled gardens and the definition of monopolistic behavior. Overall, the article and comments discuss Apple's behavior and raise concerns about monopolistic practices.Some are advocating for the break-up of tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta, which could promote healthy competition but others argue it might harm innovation and limit consumer choice. Policymakers and regulators must carefully weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks before any action is taken. However, suggestions like splitting Apple into products and services, or even splitting the US government itself into smaller pieces, were deemed unhelpful or nonsensical, and some expressed concerns about reducing competition and empowering corporations in the absence of effective regulation.China's Communist Party has ordered that Alibaba be broken up in response to viewing the company as a rival power base that threatened the party, resulting in the e-commerce titan being split into six pieces. While many claim the move is part of China's larger fight against powerful monopolies, Alibaba will likely still enjoy monopoly status in online retail, which feels like the ultimate irony. The CCP seems to be sending a message: even the biggest and most successful players in China must toe the party line or risk total destruction.",
        "summary": "Alibaba splits into six independent business units, each able to raise capital separately via IPOs, with e-commerce remaining the largest unit. The move spurs a 14% share price surge and may pre-empt regulators' intervention or signal confidence in the end of the tech crackdown.

Meanwhile, there are debates about China's government and future tech policies, as recent moves may give investors hope but risk careful vetting. The discussion also touches on monopolistic behavior in the tech industry, both in the US and China, and potential benefits and drawbacks of breaking up big tech companies. Ultimately, the CCP's decision to break up Alibaba may be aimed at enforcing its power to maintain control over rival power bases.",

        "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35423569",
        "content": "The Pandas team has released version 2.0.0, featuring new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Existing code should be upgraded to Pandas 1.5.3 before moving to the latest version. The release will be available on conda-forge and PyPI for download. While Polars still outperforms Pandas in every way, owing to its vectorization, Pandas continues to offer powerful wide ndarray and long relational style data operations, making it a go-to for analysts and engineers working on evolving models with hundreds of data sources and thousands of interactions.Scikit-learn has returned DataFrames for quite some time, with increasing in support for transformers and checking column names/order. sklearn-pandas offers casting of Polars and DuckDB to Pandas with seamless interoperability, despite being non-mainstream. Polars remains orders of magnitude faster for whole queries than pandas 2.0 backed by Arrow types (with PyArrow blindspots fixed), and now offers seamless conversion between Polars and Pandas. Polars' to-read_csv and native expression speed (via SQL pipelines without invoking the GIL) surpasses Pandas' read_csv and .apply methods. DuckDB's vectorized engine is faster for querying Pandas.A recent article compares memory usage between Pandas and Polars, but some libraries depend on Numpy directly, so there may be no avoiding Pandas in certain cases. Polars has a Python API that is much better than its Rust API, and the documentation is more complete. Polars cannot be used as a drop-in replacement for Pandas since the semantics are different, but it is not a difficult transition, and can be worth it for working with massive columnar data in Parquet. Polars is already built on Arrow and provides tremendous advantages, such as lazy evaluation and query plan optimization. The pandas 2.0 release introduces general support for arrow-specific dtypes, which might be confusing since there are now two classes of types. Automatic casting and strings as objects and integers turning into floats when NaNs are introduced remain significant frustrations for some users.Pandas 2.0 releases quality of life improvements, though it appears NumPy is still its default. Copy-on-Write is explicitly enabled if the option or context manager is enabled. Comparisons between different backends' feature and performance guidelines seem unexplored at the moment. Accessing one column of a DataFrame as a Series now returns new object every time constructed when Copy-on-Write is enabled to ensure proper functioning, which should not matter unless explicitly enabled. Most of the notebooks are a mix of SQL and Python, handling processing with SQL while pandas data frames and Python handle more difficult operations. Not many realize that pandas drew inspiration from R's base data frame (rectangular structure with mixed column types) while data frames themselves were borrowed from S already in use in 1991. The inspiration for Pandas' verbs operating on data frames was plyr and data.table.Python programmers have a new open-source library to use instead of expensive, GUI-based Stata. Even student licenses for Stata are pricey, with only those in academia, government, or non-profit industries able to potentially afford the standard license. Some users argue that Stata is obsolete, with R or Python being more commonly used for econometrics and machine learning. However, there are still some industries where Stata dominates, such as pharma, due to the conservatism and reproducibility concerns. Regardless, the price difference between the licenses and the open-source alternative is striking.",

        "content": "Safari 16.4 caused issues for Construct, a browser-based game creation app, breaking everything from opening projects to previewing projects and all published content. Construct struggled with the pre-release Safari Technology Preview and the lack of a public release schedule made it hard to anticipate possible bugs. An issue with the Compression Streams API was quickly identified and fixed by Apple, however, the broken previewing projects and published content issues were brought about by a Service Workers problem culminating in a risky emergency response. A release schedule from Apple and more transparency in the future could have saved Construct significant trouble.Safari 16.4 adds support for OffscreenCanvas, but only for the 2D context, which breaks reams of existing web content that require WebGL for rendering. An emergency patch was issued, but updating all affected content is practically infeasible as it spans across thousands of games, training materials, education materials, interactive kiosks, and more. This issue could have been averted had Apple delayed OffscreenCanvas until it supported WebGL or updated the spec to require HTML canvas and OffscreenCanvas to support the same contexts, but they have avoided making any changes. Past issues with Safari releases have also caused stress and disruption, but corporate policies at Apple contribute greatly to the problem.Developers are struggling with serious problems related to Apple's release process for Safari, which lacks transparency and delays updates. The process involves updating Safari independent of the OS, improving pre-release testing options, and better communication when issues arise. All other browser makers have more transparent development processes, making it easier for developers to plan accordingly. Developers like the technology of Safari, but dread its releases, with some urging users to switch to Chrome or Firefox. Some also suggest regulators force Apple to change.Apple\u2019s policy of not allowing its engineers to talk about when bugs and their fixes will be present in release software is negatively impacting the developer community. Safari updates are tied to OS releases, unlike other open-source projects. On top of this, the company\u2019s policy of not allowing talk about future products cripples developers\u2019 ability to plan. Soon, however, alternatives for Safari will be necessary, and developers hope that this will encourage Apple to improve the browser. Third-party apps that are native, not just web wrappers that use WebKit/Safari, are also affected by these issues.Zip.js, a JavaScript library for working with zip files, has integrated the CompressionStream API that's been available in Chromium-based browsers for the past ten years. The API can detect the presence of a compression implementation across all stable browsers, but implementation bugs cannot be detected. The library additionally provides options to disable use of the API or to work with fallback implementations in case errors arise. The consensus is that feature detection rather than user-agent sniffing is preferable, and that waiting to adopt new APIs could mean potentially missing out on competitive advantages.macOS and iOS are receiving lockstep updates due to sharing code and security vulnerabilities. The updates are still released simultaneously with macOS in its other versions. There are separate Safari updates only for back support of older macOS versions. Safari has created bugs that impact front-end developers significantly. Apple does not have a monopoly, as per the definition. Apple may soon be required by EU regulations to allow third-party browsers and app stores. A Chrome bug causes issues in Gecko and WebKit as well, which suggests that it is not a quirk from Gecko. The consensus is that browser bundling is not ideal, and the industry should test their products on several browsers.The Hard limit is on the element which is a direct child of a Document, such as Document.documentElement. Blink throws a DOMException instead of following the standard set forth in the DOM Parsing and Serialization standard. Users who seek global web compatibility have the option to use a Safari-first approach to minimize issues when developing web code. However, others believe that this approach is disheartening and expensive, as Apple fails to provide free VMs for the purpose of testing sites and investigating issues. Comments also debate the merits of using Chrome versus Safari, particularly concerning web API support and standardization.Chrome's origin trial is a process for testing and experimenting with new features. However, it's temporary, and not all Chrome visitors are eligible. Chrome often ships APIs that it calls standard, even without other browsers' independent implementations. Safari and Firefox objected to Chrome's Constructible Stylesheets and WebMIDI, which Chrome shipped as a part of a whole bunch of hardware APIs, leaving no consensus. Chrome is becoming a monopoly enforced by developers, and it gives performance advantages to itself over other browsers, becoming the new IE.The article discusses the importance of Apple's app store guidelines and the company's cut of revenue. The comment section devolves into a debate over whether Safari or Chrome is better for web development. Some argue that Safari often requires extra testing and development, while others counter that the issue lies with the developers themselves. One commenter suggests that the root issue is Apple's lack of communication and support for developers, particularly in regards to service workers and other features. Overall, the article holds Apple accountable for their policies, while the comments offer varying opinions on the state of web development.Developers discuss how Safari/iOS-specific bugs seem to be a common occurrence due to most frontend people using Chrome. Some developers suggest that those who dislike testing in multiple browsers are complaining only because they don't want to admit it. Others point out that Safari/mac/iOS and Chrome/blink are the only widely adopted browsers, so bugs are not surprising. While some developers dislike working with Apple's browser, others defend its privacy promises and development schedule. Some compare the difficulty of supporting iOS and macOS in web development to the challenges of developing for IE in the past. One developer mentions intentionally testing on a low-end device to ensure better compatibility. Others mention the frustration of sites that are only optimized for Chrome.Developers have expressed frustration with Safari's frequent broken features, but some argue that Safari is not as bad as IE was in its time. Some argue that Chrome's attitude toward browser standardization is reminiscent of IE6. Apple could benefit from more transparency and better communication about Safari updates, but there are compliance tests, and it is difficult to create comprehensive tests. Some developers prefer Safari for its performance and battery life on Apple Silicon. Compatibility issues between Safari's and Chrome's quirks can cause frustration for some developers.A developer has complained about the difficulty in working with Safari, and that Apple should take more responsibility in fixing issues. Some feel that this is due to a lack of unit testing and reliance on new features without proper validation. Others believe that developers should be grateful for any help they receive, as ultimately they must support Safari. Despite this, many feel that Safari is outdated and that Apple needs to invest more in QA. There are also concerns about the lack of transparency surrounding Safari updates, and the challenges in developing for a browser with limited developer tool options.Developers face challenges maintaining compatibility with Safari, as Apple\u2019s browser routinely breaks web standards and APIs. Regressions are common when dealing with Safari, and the browser\u2019s implementation of standards can be incomplete. Finding workarounds for Safari can be challenging, as Apple has its own set of specifications. Safari Technology Preview (STP) can provide a preview of features set to be released, but it does not entirely eliminate compatibility issues. Browser testing can be aided using websites such as Thinky Bits and insider tech news outlets.Developers are frustrated with the lack of transparency and communication from Apple regarding Safari releases and bug fixes. Safari is criticized for its buggy and inconsistent performance, and the absence of nightly builds or public schedules. Some argue that the browser industry needs to have automatic tests that run on various browsers to ensure compatibility. Others point out that new features lead to inconsistency in implementation between browsers, and that tests and user feedback should be encouraged to report problems.Users may not switch to another browser if their preferred one doesn't work; they are more likely to stick with their usual browser if it works. Some users will have multiple browsers installed due to an IT department's testing needs, but the majority will only use one. Users may migrate to using a different browser if their workflows do not work on their primary browser, especially if multiple sites break at the same time. For sites that do not support Safari, some users may take their business elsewhere. Apple does not let its mobile users use an alternate browser engine, and it is unknown if Safari users first blame their browser and switch to another one before giving up on a site.",

        "content": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a little-known, psychologically-backed framework that helps people deal with uncertainty and stress that often come with entrepreneurship. ACT teaches you how to change how your thoughts and feelings influence your behavior and to stay oriented towards what you care about even when dealing with negative thoughts and feelings. The ultimate goal of ACT is to help us move closer to what we care about in life. Moving from experiential avoidance to willingness and from fusion to defusion are two important practices that ACT encourages for psychological flexibility.In ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), fusion and defusion are explored to help people move toward their desired directions in life. Defusion involves seeing thoughts as events in awareness, not necessarily as reality or truth. Past/future preoccupation is a type of fusion where people lose contact with the present by getting lost in thoughts of the past or future. Rigid stories about self and others are another common type of fusion. Flexible perspective-taking involves recognizing that no negative story is the whole truth about a person, and that any label we self-identify with captures only a small slice of our complexity. Finally, clarifying values can help combat aimlessness and lack of direction in life.Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) emphasizes the importance of connecting daily activities to meaningful values, and clarifying what a life well-lived looks like. Unlike goals, values are ways of being and doing that are intrinsically meaningful and never finished, and give meaning to actions. ACT utilizes awareness of mortality to contact what deeply matters to us and highlights areas in which we are living out of alignment with our values. Committed action, or finding places to shift behavior in alignment with values, is crucial to creating larger behavioral patterns in service of our ultimate goal of living fully.The article on Hacker News discusses the importance of self-discipline when it comes to finishing tasks; it highlights how powering through the 'boring bits' and starting the day early can do wonders for self-image and confidence. Some comments agree with the article, discussing how getting unpleasant tasks out of the way first thing in the day can be powerful, while others add personal tips on developing good habits for doing hard things, such as starting with the same thing every day and listening to oneself when deciding how to approach a task.An article and comments explore the idea that doing hard things can eventually make those things easier. However, one commenter struggles with finding anything becoming easier despite their hard work, and seeks advice on how to make it easier to \"eat the frog\". Other comments offer similar reframes, such as military-sounding mantras of \"embrace the suck\" and \"eat the pain\", or the concept of ACT, which focuses on aversion and realizing that avoiding something may be worse than the pain of actually doing it. The article and comments overall offer perspectives on the mental shifts that can occur when pushing through difficult tasks.An article discusses how to deal with hard tasks, such as working out or doing boring but necessary work. The author advocates for embracing the \"suck\" and accepting that it will be difficult. Others in the comments suggest focusing on instrumental music, developing habits, and rewarding oneself for good work done. Some commenters feel that complaining can be useful, while others advocate for focusing on the positive aspects of the task. The question of whether people with ADHD are inherently disabled in developing self-discipline is also discussed, with varying opinions given. Some recommend therapy or medication, while others believe that it is possible to overcome the challenges of ADHD with the right strategies.Difficulty in getting started on important tasks can be a symptom of ADHD, but it can also be a result of a lack of self-discipline. Fear of failure can sometimes help people overcome this difficulty, and religion can also be a comforting solution. Some people struggle with wanting to do too many things and feeling overwhelmed. ACT therapy may help some people, but its efficacy is debated. The key to developing self-discipline is through small habit changes over time, rather than trying to make serious, overwhelming changes all at once.Practicing mindfulness for just 10 minutes a day can make a significant difference, leading to positive changes. Small changes are often achievable in situations where large changes are not, making it possible to tackle big problems. The idea of small changes has been the subject of deep exploration across many fields with extensive research. Mindfulness meditation has been studied extensively and research shows its benefits in lowering friction for difficult tasks. The causes and conditions of change are innumerable and different for each person, and can include exposure to new information and challenges to assumptions.",

        "content": "Finland is set to become a member of NATO on April 4th, 2023, with President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 attending a ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where Minister for Foreign Affairs Pekka Haavisto will deposit Finland's instrument of accession to the North Atlantic Treaty with the US State Department. The flag-raising ceremony at NATO Headquarters will follow the deposit, with President Niinist\u00f6 and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg set to make remarks at the event. Commenters discuss the current situation in Ukraine and the inadequacies of the response from those in power.Ukraine may have wanted to join NATO, but it was not invited due to Europe's desire to believe that business with Russia was still possible. This belief is even held by many people in the West, where there are inexplicable enclaves of Russophilic sentiment. Ukraine's ongoing fights to purge and root out corruption made them a threat to Putin and his backers, which resulted in a more active intervention into Ukrainian politics. Ukraine's NATO membership would bring several advantages to the alliance, but it is still a contentious issue.Recent comments on Hacker News discuss the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the potential for Ukraine to become a NATO member, with some arguing that this could have prevented the conflict from happening in the first place. However, others point out the complexities of the situation, including Ukraine's geographic position and the potential political pressure on other NATO members to contribute to their defense. Some comments also touch on the propaganda and misinformation surrounding the conflict and the difficulties of finding a neutral stance. Overall, the conversation highlights the geopolitical tensions and the importance of context and nuance in understanding the situation.The article discusses the proximity of various countries to Russia and how it affects their military defense capabilities. The comments discuss the importance of advanced weapons systems and the fact that NATO already has a land border with Russia through Estonia and Latvia. There is also discussion of the geopolitical reasons for Russian aggression towards Ukraine and the idea that granting Russia the Sudetenland in a peace agreement would only embolden them for further aggression.Finland joining NATO and Sweden's potential approval soon after is gaining attention from those interested in global theater. While some individuals debate the role of both parties, others suggest that Sweden's association with Turkey may prove problematic in certain scenarios. Despite this, NATO's approval of both countries is a momentous occasion, as the organization typically brings together the world's most elite winter fighting forces. Although the war in Ukraine serves as a grim reminder of the potential dangers of global conflict, the opinions shared throughout the comments suggest the value of building relationships through commerce rather than warfare.Finland's conservative party has claimed victory in the parliamentary elections, set to strengthen its sovereignty with its desire to join NATO. The threat of Russia has caused Finland, along with Sweden, to form a unified Nordic air defence aimed at containing the rising threat from Russia. The move is seen as another geostrategic blunder for Putin as he has gained 800 miles of border directly exposed to NATO, and thus, the US' grand strategy is to build the largest military, democratic, and economic alliance to solidify its hegemony. Nonetheless, the idea of a world with nuclear weapons everywhere is troubling, and small countries might have to rely on big countries for protection against nuclear states.Finland would develop nukes now if not for the option to join NATO. Illusion has shattered that Russia respects international order, the one where you don't touch borders for no reason. Countries that did not feel safe moved much faster than others. Article 5 is a good strategy for deterring Russia, representing principle an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. NATO membership may make wars with Russia less likely. Finland is more than capable of defending itself, but NATO membership raises the threshold to invade immensely. The only decision left is how best to control the dangers of Russian aggression.Comments on a political issue between Germany and Sweden concerning the sharing of information about the Nord Stream bombings; Finland's membership in a team is mentioned. One commenter argues that Sweden should not be part of NATO if they do not cooperate with Germany, while another suggests that Sweden may be hiding their findings due to a potential US involvement in the bombings. Sweden's reluctance to share information may be due to their need for the US as an ally. The truth about the bombings remains uncertain.",

        "content": "Richard Geldreich's blog discusses the relevance of simple ultra-high speed lossy or near-lossless image codecs, built from the new generation of fast LZ codecs, which will become more common in the future as computing bottlenecks change over time. Geldreich constructs LZ Preconditioners and builds new LZ codecs that amend themselves to this step, done to minimize visible artifacts, introducing more or longer matches. To make the codec lossy, the encoder needs to precondition the image data. Such a codec will have blazingly fast decompression rates, be very simple, and will likely not bloat executables because the LZ4 library is already present in many codebases.Web standards have not caught up with modern GPU compression formats, resulting in the need to use a WebGL context to display higher quality images. GPUs can do LZ4 decompression, but web standard support is lacking. Lossless compression of textures is proprietary and done by the GPU itself. Lossless framebuffer compression is important in cases of MSAA or SSAA. While high-speed bandwidth may be on the rise, computation power increases much more slowly. An image codec such as PNG is not a video codec, and does not work well with multi-threading or GPU decoding. Videos are not a good substitute for images on websites. Lossy LZ4I is down to 696819 bytes when optimized using lossless PNG compression (OxiPNG + AdvPNG).The text describes an idea of preprocessing an image with small changes to improve compression with fast LZ codecs without requiring a reversal step. While there is an argument that PNG is no longer Pareto-optimal due to alternatives that compress much better and are also lossless, LZ4 still provides advantages for bottlenecked CPU time. JPEG works similarly by preprocessing DCT blocks to throw away data or add noise to enable compression. Preprocessing does not require a reversal step, unlike JPEG's DCT that requires an IDCT, and chroma conversion, that the client needs to understand and know about. Zstd, which has demonstrated that you can have both fast decoding and high compression, could be an alternative to lz4 preprocessing.Big-endian (BE) systems are already here and in use, although they are not very common, according to a recent discussion on Hacker News. The HN discussion thread was prompted by an article that explored an image compression format that aims to replace older formats such as JPEG, but some commentators questioned whether the new format was suitable for use with legacy BE systems. While there was debate around the issue, there was more agreement on the idea that optimising compression for CPU power consumption would yield better results.A recent discussion about CO2 emission caused by downloading games fails to take into account the relatively low power consumption of downloading compared to actual gameplay, even on slow connections, and the fact that updates and patches are not released daily. While some debate the carbon cost of downloads versus physical media, others dismiss the idea of optimizing for CO2 emissions as \"eco-virtue-signalling.\" Ideas for improving image loading times and efficiency include progressive JPEGs and using wavelets, but these may come at the cost of compression rates and memory efficiency.",
