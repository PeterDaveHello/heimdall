Because they pretend to speak human language, but they actually don’t. For a human, yesterday is “at the day before”, “between 0am..11:59pm the day before today”. No human uses “less that 24 hours” as the definition of “yesterday”. Computers, unfortunately, do. Add here that different implementations calculate “yesterday” differently (even on the same service) → lack of trust → less useful. And don’t get me started on “12 days ago”. This is complete bullshit. No human thinks in terms of “5+ days ago”. Last week—maybe. But not this. (don’t use “last week/month/year”, too — it becomes too vague. Use specific day) Thanks syL for the pictures October 4, 2023 // Permalink Nikita Prokopov, Dmitrii Dimandt, Rakhim Davletkaliyev & contributors. 2017–2222. All fights retarded.",

On YouTube, \"1 year ago\" can mean anywhere from 365 to 729 days. Anything between 1 and 2 years ago becomes \"1 year ago\".So if I see two videos that were both uploaded \"a year ago\", it&#x27;s impossible to know which is more recent without actually opening the videos, going to the description, and looking at the date. reply jjav 12 hours agoparentI feel like there was a UI designer convention and they had a contest on the best way to hate on users with GUI microagressions and this \"N days ago\" trend won so now it&#x27;s everywhere.I don&#x27;t want to do date math in my head!

To me \"3 years ago\" reads \"sometime in 2020, who knows?\" but it might be \"October 2020\" to someone else. It&#x27;s so imprecise as to be rather useless. reply cushpush 4 hours agorootparentOne more significant digit solves this: 3.2 years ago reply yonatan8070 2 hours agorootparentExcept that saying \"1.5 years ago\" with a decimal would be 1 year and 6 months ago, and you won&#x27;t want to do the conversions from a base 10 to base 12 for the month.

Unix variants seem fine with it. reply layer8 11 hours agorootparentWindows does not allow the colon (\":\") in filenames, so you can&#x27;t use the ISO date-time format in filenames anyway.RFC 3339 notes: NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by \"T\". Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by (say) a space character.I tend to use the space whenever possible.Note also that ISO 8601 doesn&#x27;t require the \"T\" to be uppercase.

Same with newlines. It&#x27;s all bytes. replysolardev 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s missing the time zone offset &#x2F;cryI had to fix so many of these in various databases and frontends, lol reply Karellen 13 hours agorootparentWhy not just display it in the viewers&#x27; timezone? reply solardev 8 hours agorootparentHow do you know what time zone to convert it FROM? Unlike epoch time (Unix time in milliseconds or seconds), \"2021-11-21T15:10:35\" doesn&#x27;t automatically mean UTC without a \"Z\" or \"+0\" at the end. Without the time offset, that timestamp could be in any of the world&#x27;s timezones. There&#x27;s no way to know what moment in time was actually stored&#x2F;meant.Even if the user set it in one time zone, if we store it without a proper offset (and preferably a locale), we cannot properly account for the user traveling to another place, daylight savings time, government time adjustments, leap time, etc. These complexities compound off each other and make proper scheduling and debugging time issues really, REALLY hard later on.In the twenty years or so that I&#x27;ve been doing web dev, datetime is probably the single biggest gotcha I&#x27;ve seen developers (including myself) stumble into. Part of this is because the standard JS datetime handling is atrocious compared to any other language I&#x27;ve worked in. It doesn&#x27;t really natively handle time zones well, and well carelessly cast them back and forth if you&#x27;re not careful.Moment and Luxon can help with this, lighter libs like date-fns can too with the right extensions, but out of the box JS is going to fuck it up. I promise. Another choice is to just use milliseconds to store everything, and convert that to the user&#x27;s timezone only at the time of display. Every timestamp is stored as an epoch, and every user has their time zone (not just offset, because of daylight savings) recorded with their profile. Doing those two simple things can avoid most of the landmines. reply whirlwin 12 hours agorootparentprevHow do you determine the viewer&#x27;s timezone? A lot of apps try to find your timezone and it works fine until you travel abroad to a country with a different timezone. reply cratermoon 10 hours agorootparentprevMostly because the browser Javascript API for Date is kind of crap for dealing with timezone info. There are some efforts to standardize on a better API, but it&#x27;s going to take time to migrate. reply Moru 13 hours agorootparentprevNot used for display purposes though :-) reply matja 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s missing the timezone offset reply barbazoo 15 hours agorootparentprevTime portion not being useful I&#x27;d say. reply dmd 15 hours agorootparentprevYou mean 1637507435? reply pjscott 11 hours agorootparentYes.

Let&#x27;s design heuristics that work culturally in some parts of the world and be imprecise instead! reply wlesieutre 17 hours agoparentprevIt’ll even round down when it’s the same day.A video uploaded two years ago on 10&#x2F;14&#x2F;2021 would still tell you it was one year old if it were uploaded later in the day. reply o11c 15 hours agoparentprevThe imprecision could be fixed by forbidding the first digit from being 1, switching to a lower unit instead. So up to 120 seconds ago, then up to 120 minutes ago, then up to 48 hours ago, then up to ~61 days ago (ick, months are evil), then up to 24 months ago.When such relative dates are in a list it&#x27;s generally tolerable. The failure to update is far more irritating, and limiting to \"yesterday\" does not fix that. reply Zambyte 17 hours agoparentprevI found myself using an official YouTube client by accident recently, and it was so jarring to not be able to easily see when the video I was watching was uploaded. reply nfriedly 15 hours agorootparentIt looks like there isn&#x27;t a revanced patch for that yet, but I bet there will be soon. reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 6 hours agoparentprev\"So if I see two videos that were both uploaded \"a year ago\", it&#x27;s impossible to know which is more recent without actually opening the videos, going to the description, and looking at the date.\"For better or worse (worse, IMHO), this is how YouTube search works. It takes at least two HTTP requests to get the precise dates. One to retreieve the SERP. Another to retrieve the JSON for each videoID. The JSON contains the upload date, etc.IMO this sort of inefficient design pattern is faciltated by web developers who rely on Javascript, which is seemingly all of them. Webpages become shells for advertising and Javascript is used to fetch non-advertising, i.e., data. Google wants users to make clicks and track them, i.e., collect behavioural data. Thus it makes sense that a user would be forced to \"open\" a video to see its actual upload date.The suite of tiny custom utilties I wrote in C can search YT and retrieve all YT videos, this can be upwards of 900 results. The output is CSV, SQL or simple HTML, including upload date and other data I find useful. This is done using only two TCP connections. No browser is needed. The simple HTML is just a page that looks like CSV, with a hyperlink to the video file. It&#x27;s \"YT redesigned\" to look like I want it to look. I do the web development before opening the page in a browser.The custom \"downloader\" I wrote is smaller, simpler and faster than yt-dlp. No Python required. But most times I don&#x27;t download. I just use the simple HTML that looks like CSV. IMHO, this is much better than Google&#x27;s privacy-invasive page laden with Javascript. I can see the precise dates and other useful data. I can sort by vaious columns. And I can exclude garbage videos that Google (\"the algorithm\") inserts into results, videos that have nothing to do with the search query string I submitted. reply BD103 16 hours agoparentprevNot to mention, it is a lot easier to program a function formatting the text to exact dates than writing a function that estimates how long ago it was. reply siva7 11 hours agoparentprevI sometimes really wonder who the heck greenlights such horrible UX at Google. reply bilekas 16 hours agoparentprevI was just thinking about that the other day.. reply Y_Y 16 hours agorootparent> File last modified: the other dayI think I&#x27;d be ok with this. I love the KDE fuzzy clock that says it&#x27;s \"about lunchtime\", much more human than the examples people are decrying here. reply Brian_K_White 13 hours agorootparentBut of course \"lunchtime\" is a completely meaningless term for me.1 - I rarely eat a meal in the middle of my day. In fact I usually only eat once, so is that one meal lunch? or breakfast? or dinner? or what ??2 - My day not only isn&#x27;t the same as yours, it isn&#x27;t even the same from day to day, so even if I agreed to call my one meal lunch instead of dinner, it does not come at the same time as yours does, and does not even come at the same time from day to day, and does not even come at the same time relative to when I am awake let alone the absoluet time.It&#x27;s inconsiderate to think this is reasonable for everyone else because it&#x27;s reasonable for you. It&#x27;s like how kids and the untravelled and otherwise ignorant presume everyone else&#x27;s life is exactly the same as theirs.I could translate of course, because of course I know what it means for probably the majority of everyone else, but why should I have to do that? This whole topic is about convenience and meaning, and this would be inconvenient and of only arbitrary meaning to me. It would be like calling it \"triangle time\" sure, I could just know that that means around noon. Why should my interface require me to translate from markers that are meaningful to someone else&#x27;s life but not to mine?A worse example just to show what&#x27;s so wrong would be like calling sunday \"church day\". Or sunday afternoon \"right after church\". That would be not only inconsiderate but downright offensive. For a lot of people that would be perfectly fine and some of them would even fail to see why that should be a problem for anyone.And the offense isn&#x27;t just mentioning a religion, it&#x27;s the assumption, the turning anyone else into the exception, when they are not an exception, they are equal. reply Y_Y 10 hours agorootparentWould you still be upset if I told you it has a hobbit setting where you get times like \"second breakfast\" and \"elevenses\". I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re a cool person and I don&#x27;t want to denigrate your lifestyle, but the thing I&#x27;m talking about is a humorous desktop widget on an eopen-source desktop.

If only I had explained anything at all instead of just saying I hate some idea for no unpackable explicable reason... reply malfist 13 hours agorootparentprevIf the thought of a clock that says \"about lunch time\" sends you into a seven paragraph manifesto about the evils of the clock.....perhaps you should just not use it. reply Brian_K_White 11 hours agorootparentExhibit A reply jimmySixDOF 15 hours agorootparentprevCould even be personalized so the date appears as \"the same weekend you and Charlie went out on the boat\" reply LordShredda 14 hours agorootparentFunnily enough google collects enough data for that to be possible reply Freedom2 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s precisely the joke, why bother restating it? reply Moru 15 hours agorootparentprevMy old phones&#x27; timer said \"Less than 1 minute\" instead of saying 59 seconds...

It&#x27;s pretty useless to tell me it&#x27;s less than one minute left until the eggs are done. Do I have time to do a bit more dishes or will the phone ring in one second? Who knows? reply bilekas 15 hours agorootparentprevInteresting you say that actually, I have been working on a folder synch implementation across samba with mac & win environments and the last modified times are not a reliable source of truth it seems. This fuzzy method would have been very useful as the exact minute of the modified file isn&#x27;t critical.In the end though we just used checksums, but over the wire the larger files take too long. This comment has given me an idea! reply kevincox 13 hours agorootparentGetting off topic but most sync systems do a quick comparison then a full one.So for example check modified, inode number against the previous version. If they are all a match consider skipping the checksum. This way you can skip almost all checksums on an incremental transfer. You can have false-negatives but this can often be mitigated by occasionally doing a full rescan or similar. reply bilekas 13 hours agorootparent> So for example check modified, inode number against the previous version.To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even try this because the destination machine is Windows, I didnt think inode number had an equivalent in windows, but after googling, there might be a way.Another great suggestion.As for the full checksum, I went with a chunk size of the first and the last of the file, (the changes are very small, property based) but I don&#x27;t think its as reliable. reply gsich 15 hours agorootparentprevAs long as its configurable - all fine. reply marktani 12 hours agorootparentprev> I was just thinking about that on 2023-10-10FTFY reply Horffupolde 17 hours agoparentprevUse the URL reply fifticon 14 hours agoprevHow can I upvote this enough..

I have an application that pulls information in from another database, reformats it, and displays it for the user. The update is expensive and time-consuming, so it has to be triggered manually by the user when it is needed. In this case, the exact time of the last update isn’t particularly useful; the only thing that matters is how old the data is, which is to say how likely it is to be out of sync with the source of truth. In some cases, information needs to be as up-to-the-minute as possible, so if the info is just a few hours old it needs to be refreshed. Other times, information that is 4 or 5 days out of date or longer is totally fine, so there is no need to trigger an update that could take as long as 10 minutes.For this particular purpose, fuzzing the date is actually more useful that providing the time of the last update, since order-of-magnitude precision is good enough, and it saves the user from having to compare the update time to the current time and do a calculation. Admittedly though, this is a rare case, and the vast majority of the time a relative fuzzy date is less helpful. reply djha-skin 10 hours agorootparentDate calculations are really easy for most people.

But this is relevant even for personal matters -- e.g., was this photo taken before a friend&#x27;s wedding or after, etc.Given how imprecise relative dates are they are not of much help for that.And in the case I&#x27;m not looking to compare dates, seeing relative dates doesn&#x27;t really add any value for me either.Also, it&#x27;s quite obvious something happened 1, 2, 3 years ago from seeing the actual date. reply michaelcampbell 18 hours agorootparentprevI agree and enjoy this, but I&#x27;m old and use mostly a computer where I have a mouse to hover with.

What&#x27;s wrong with just the date? reply jameshart 17 hours agorootparentAn actual usecase:When I’m looking at when a merge request was merged in to master in gitlab, often the level of granularity I am interested in is ‘roughly how long ago’, or ‘what day in the last week was that?’ - the thing I am trying to figure out is just ‘did that go live last Tuesday or last Wednesday?’I can recover that information from a date with a little mental arithmetic or a cross lookup to a calendar but it would be nice if the computer told me that.On the other hand, sometimes when I am looking for when a git merge request was merged in I am looking for ‘was it a few minutes before or a few minutes after this error started happening in production?’ And the precise timestamp is of intense interest. At that point seeing a bunch of merge requests tagged as ‘last Tuesday’ is incredibly unhelpful to me. But so would just an unadorned date be.In general I would lean towards providing the information in a raw form but also contextualized.But ‘just a date’ is often the worst of both worlds. Even worse if I don’t know which time zone the date is being reported relative to (people often display UTC dates without clarifying that, or even considering that dates need time zone adjusting too).My dream contextualized timestamp would be something like 2023&#x2F;10&#x2F;09 13:47:20 (Monday, 5 days ago) reply john_cogs 15 hours agorootparentYou can set your preference to display exact times in GitLab.

Showing both the precise datetime of creation and a \"human readable ago\" seems to cover a lot of bases that users seem to like, though. Recall, we&#x27;re commenting on a thread that&#x27;s proposing removing a feature that already exists (so presumably people want it). reply myk9001 16 hours agorootparentThe idea of rendering relative dates instead of the actual dates caught up about 10 maybe 15 years ago (a relative date here, yes).I think -- but don&#x27;t take my word for it -- it was Jeff Atwood who started advocating for it.So we might be talking not about removing a feature, but correcting a mistake here :) reply myk9001 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat are some situations where you find calculating the relative date useful?Personally, if I care about a timestamp at all it&#x27;s because I want to compare it to another date (maybe a past date, maybe a present or future one): a deadline, an event, a birthday. Relative dates actually make such comparisons harder.On the other hand, seeing an actual date like 2022&#x2F;10&#x2F;03 it&#x27;s dead simple to tell that was a year ago, it&#x27;s equally easy to tell whether something happened this year, or last month, or two days ago, etc. reply johnnyanmac 12 hours agorootparentwe&#x27;re talking about a casual context, so the average user doesn&#x27;t need an exact time stamp on when a picture was taken. The average person doesn&#x27;t talk in time stamps, so the paradigm was shifted to display how people communicated.Another nitpick is that relative dates solve the date format issue. No need to fuss over YYYY&#x2F;MM&#x2F;DD or DD&#x2F;MM&#x2F;YYYY or any other permutation, but we all can agree on when \"7 months ago\" was. reply mvdtnz 17 hours agorootparentprev\"Significantly\"?

I don&#x27;t remember if that couldn&#x27;t be changed or the person in charge just could not&#x2F;would not do it, but I needed the proper dates often. So I wrote a basic user script which would read the actual dates out of the title (at least the date was in there) tags and then replace the unusable default output with it. I put that in button on the bookmarks bar and over time, several people saw it and adopted my solution. I never met anyone who liked the \"human readable\" format more that the actual date. reply jks 3 hours agoprevIn the other direction (and on a different scale) I hate it when the bus-schedule app I use tells me that my bus leaves \"in 8 minutes\".

People will say at 9pm \"I did it yesterday\" about something they&#x27;d done the previous date at 6pm reply thfuran 18 hours agorootparentI think you switched around your sixes and nines. reply tomjakubowski 11 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I mixed it up> No human uses “more that 24 hours” as the definition of “yesterday”. Computers, unfortunately, do.At 9pm on Oct 14, 6pm on Oct 13 was > 24 hours ago, and people would still call it \"yesterday\". reply olddustytrail 18 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re saying it can&#x27;t be more than 24 hours just that it can be less.Clearly it&#x27;s confusingly worded so probably best if they just redo it. reply tomjakubowski 11 hours agorootparentagreed completely - \"yesterday\" usually includes times both greater than and less than 24 hours ago. People usually just mean… some time in the date previous to now. Roughly. replydreamcompiler 16 hours agoprevThis is an issue in the spatial domain too. Whenever somebody invites me to their house I ask them \"what&#x27;s the address?\" and they inevitably proceed to give me a long verbal list of relative directions: \"Go east on highway 10 and take the first exit, then turn left, go two blocks, and then turn right.\" There are a thousand ways this can go wrong. Errors compound.Please just give me your actual street address, and Google and I will figure out how to get there.**Except yes, Google gets many addresses wrong. Those are the exception. reply survirtual 16 hours agoparentAlmost every address where someone says \"google gets it wrong\" is simply not accurate. Mapping software was right every time.The maps are constantly updated, whether google, apple, or openstreet. The perception of them being inaccurate unfortunately does not tend to update. reply poorlyknit 16 hours agorootparentGoogle Maps used to be really bad in my then neighborhood which had roads and garages underground and bike lanes and footpaths on the ground level.For the longest time they didn&#x27;t even have the numbers of individual houses and treated the whole area as an atomic blob :shrug: A neighbor put the numbers into OpenStreetMap eventually and soon after Google Maps had then too.For a while they still treated it as a normal road though which means \"find route\" was still unusable but you could at least use it as a map. Nowadays they have separate entries for the above-ground paths and it works.EDIT: Please someone write \"Falsehoods programmers believe about city planning\" reply codazoda 15 hours agoprevGitHub is my worst offender. When I need a timestamp for Git I always need the exact date and time, even if it&#x27;s recent.This was mentioned elsewhere but it&#x27;s buried under another comment. I think GitHub needs top level placement for this audience. I imagine a lot of us feel this pain from time to time. reply djha-skin 14 hours agoprevI actually really hate fuzzy date displays. More often than not I want to know exactly when something happened and 2 hours ago isn&#x27;t usually good enough. Just tell me the exact time I&#x27;m a smart guy I can figure out how long ago that was. reply oftenwrong 18 hours agoprevOn a related note, I dislike when time zones are omitted from displayed datetimes. I have to guess: Is it my client&#x27;s tz, the server&#x27;s tz, UTC, or something else? reply snarfy 15 hours agoprevI&#x27;ll leave my chat program open for two weeks and it says the message was received &#x27;yesterday&#x27;, even though it was actually two weeks ago but hasn&#x27;t updated because it&#x27;s just been sitting there idle. Anything other than the actual timestamp is utterly useless. reply layer8 15 hours agoparentThat particular point is an implementation issue, however. There are web forums I frequent where the time indications update in realtime while the page is just sitting there. reply quitit 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not alone in this, Apple&#x27;s Mail app used to display Monday&#x2F;Tuesday&#x2F;Wednesday&#x2F;etc for the last week of email before switching to numeric dates. It would drive me crazy as I mentally work with dates and having to constantly check \"ok what date was last Tuesday\", \"ok what date was last Saturday\", introduced needless complexity.Someone must have spoken up, because it&#x27;s now as follows: the time(for today&#x27;s email), \"Yesterday\", then the numerical dates.On a tangent: Maybe one of our german friends can answer if the day before yesterday is displayed as \"vorgestern\", since that&#x27;s part of the german lexicon.Second tangent: While we&#x27;re at it, can English finally standardise what \"next \" means. For example I&#x27;m writing this on Saturday, and \"next Monday\" is permitted to mean either in 2 days time or in 9 days time. reply xp84 14 hours agoprevIt’s interesting here in that there’s a sizable group (looks to me like 25% but let’s be generous and assume 50%). Seems like the kind of thing that should 100% be a user preference.Too bad “having too many options” is perceived as a bad thing by the current regime of aesthetics-first “designers.” It’s the only thing they hate more than using screen real estate for something besides seas of white space. reply jameshart 17 hours agoprev> No human uses “less that 24 hours” as the definition of “yesterday”. Computers, unfortunately, doCorrection: computers programmed by programmers who believe falsehoods about time zones and dates do.It’s entirely possible to unambiguously slide a timestamp into the local calendar of your user and from that determine what the local date offset is. If you just take floor(now - time &#x2F; 86400) then of course you’re going to produce garbage. reply ctxc 18 hours agoprevWe&#x27;ll I&#x27;d much rather see \"posted last week\" where precision isn&#x27;t needed over having to look up the date in the calendar.Where precision is needed (maybe finegrained transactions?) date and time might be better. reply jstanley 18 hours agoparentThe problem is that on Monday morning \"posted last week\" could mean it was posted less than 12 hours ago, or almost an entire week ago. reply DixieDev 18 hours agorootparentWhere have you seen a service describing something posted less than 12 hours ago as being \"posted last week\" rather than \"posted yesterday\"&#x2F;\"posted today\"? reply idbehold 18 hours agorootparentThe point is that both are technically correct. At 12:00am on January 1 that happens to fall on a Monday something that occurred 1 second ago can be considered to have taken place: last week (depending on when you consider weeks to start&#x2F;end), last month, last year, yesterday, etc. reply mynameisvlad 18 hours agorootparentSure, they’re both technically correct, but that wasn’t the question. The question was> Where have you seen a service describing something posted less than 12 hours ago as being \"posted last week\" rather than \"posted yesterday\"&#x2F;\"posted today\"?Every single time display library I have seen will do as the poster explained, and show more granular information the closer it is (generally starting at “X seconds ago”). Your technicality is certainly true, but a strawman. reply JdeBP 17 hours agorootparentActually, it&#x27;s that question that is the straw man. jstanley&#x27;s point is that to the reader \"posted last week\" could mean almost no time at all ago. It&#x27;s not about the display library choosing to label recent things as this. It&#x27;s about humans reading such a label and not receiving the intended information, because humans don&#x27;t cut off what they understand \"last week\" to mean at some arbitrary 12-hours-ago mark. reply mynameisvlad 15 hours agorootparentExcept they do get the intended information. The label doesn’t exist in a vacuum; the user would have seen other examples showing the specificity at intervals other than “last week” which sensitizes them to the cutoff points.This is literally a non-problem. If a library behaved in the way the parent commenter makes them seem like, then, sure, they have a point. But they don’t. Something that occurred a second ago would say “a second ago”. Something that occurred 5 minutes and 43 seconds ago would say “6 minutes ago”, etc. There is no library in the world which takes a timestamp a second ago and outputs “a week ago” and pretending like there is is, literally, a strawman. reply jstanley 14 hours agorootparent> the user would have seen other examplesYeah, I&#x27;ve seen enough examples to know that no 2 websites implement the same logic so I shouldn&#x27;t try to second-guess anything more than what the text literally says. reply mvdtnz 17 hours agorootparentprevIf the user needs to know the details of your \"time display library\" to disambiguate \"last week\" then you&#x27;ve already lost. It&#x27;s bad UX. Stop doing it. reply mynameisvlad 15 hours agorootparentBut… users don’t. Literally no library out there does what the parent commenter claims they could do. They all use sensible cutovers for relative dates. reply mvdtnz 14 hours agorootparentThe point is that if a user sees \"last week\" it&#x27;s ambiguous. They DON&#x27;T KNOW that your libraries don&#x27;t behave that way. All they see is \"last week\". Are you really not getting this? replykube-system 18 hours agorootparentprevMost of the date libraries that do relative time formatting like this would use hours if it were hours ago. reply makeitdouble 18 hours agoparentprevAt the \"last week\" level, assuming we don&#x27;t keep track of today&#x27;s date, wouldn&#x27;t it be good enough to see in the date if it&#x27;s in the same month or not, and eventually see if it&#x27;rougly at the beginning, muddle or end of it ?If you were told something was uploaded on 2023-10-02, with just the average feeling that we&#x27;re currently around the middle of the month we&#x27;d know the video is roughly a week or two in the past. reply dolni 16 hours agoparentprevIf precision isn&#x27;t needed, why do you need to know it was last week? Why can&#x27;t the precise date be displayed for those who need it? reply yosito 18 hours agoparentprevIf it&#x27;s December 25th and something says \"December 20th\", so you really have to look at a calendar to know when it was, relative to today? reply mathijs 16 hours agoparentprevExactly. A video on YouTube posted &#x27;1 month ago&#x27; is not the latest episode I&#x27;m looking for. Much quicker to interpret than a timestamp. Sometimes a fuzzy date is enough.Especially being from Europe: it is never clear if 10&#x2F;04&#x2F;23 means October 4th or April 11th unless you know which date format is being used. reply crgi 14 hours agorootparentAgree. I also like the relative dates. E.g. on Github where it’s useful to get an intuition very fast of when files in folders&#x2F;projects were last updated. I don‘t care about the actual dates in this moment, the fuzziness of the relative date is the approximation I‘m looking for. reply variants 18 hours agoparentprevWhy would you need to look up lasts week date on a calendar reply mvdtnz 17 hours agoparentprevHow do you know where precision is needed? reply unlikelytomato 18 hours agoprevMy favorite is when I see a photo posted to Google maps \"1653 days 5 hours ago\" reply temporallobe 11 hours agoprevThis kind of thing is especially egregious on the GitLab UI where, for example, something was committed “a moment ago”, “just now”, or some vague shit like that. reply thenickdude 11 hours agoparentThat one makes perfect sense to me, as if it said like \"1 second ago\", this would almost always be a wrong statement due to differing clocks, and the time taken to render and send you the page.If the time is static on the page rather than dynamically updating in JS, for such small intervals it&#x27;ll already be out of date by the time you scroll down to read it. But dynamically updating timestamps is irritating because it causes the content to \"animate\", and that movement catches the eye for no good reason, since nothing is really changing with the content (Reddit does this).Due to clock skews you can even have the event come from slightly in the future, and marking that accurately like \"2 seconds from now\" would be even more confusing.\"just now\" solves all these issues reply tapvt 18 hours agoprevThis is my biggest complaint when i reflexively type `git log` to get some context on a branch. reply microflash 16 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s a `--date` flag which you can use to control this behavior. Also, it depends on your git configuration. reply dabedee 16 hours agoprevGithub does that and it always makes it very difficult to understand when something was actually done&#x2F;committed. reply austinl 15 hours agoparentGithub was the first thing I thought of when reading this. My only use case for the commit date is to quickly check if a certain commit merged before a branch was automatically cut, so I need the day of the week and time, not \"11 days ago.\"Fortunately, if you hover over the relative date, it will expand to show the exact date time, but it would be nice if this were swapped. reply codazoda 15 hours agoparentprevYup, agreed. I came hear looking for this one. Whenever I need a timestamp in GitHub I need the exact time. I always have to hover to get the info I need. reply MisterKent 16 hours agoparentprevSeriously, of all the platforms that do this pattern, this one is the most user hostile. reply 63 more comments...

    "originBody": "Biography Quotes Nederlands Danny Mekić. SPEAKER CHAIRMAN ENTREPRENEUR INNOVATIONS CONTACT HOMEPUBLICATIONS Undermining Democracy: The European Commission's Controversial Push for Digital Surveillance 13-10-20230 Update: after this opinion article appeared in de Volkskrant, X/Twitter censored my account on their platform. My account @DannyMekic and tweets can now no longer be found via the X search engine. So I have been effectively wiped out by Elon Musk and his team, but I don’t know why, how and on behalf of whom they did this – or if this was their own initiative. Please help me by (1) following me on Twitter via this direct link (2) posting a tweet to Elon Musk and his team, and ask them to undo this, and (3) following me on BlueSky. The European Commission wants to turn digital communication apps, such as WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram, TikTok and X, into mass surveillance tools so that digital communications of all EU citizens, including their live conversations, photos and videos, can be automatically scanned for criminal offences.[1] Even of citizens who are not suspected of any crime. This proposal for a CSAM regulation has been unanimously condemned by hundreds of academics,[2] privacy regulators,[3] and even internal legal experts at the Council of the European Union itself for its gross violation of privacy rights,[4] but also because the technology to be used to implement it is fundamentally flawed. Indeed, artificial intelligence cannot accurately detect criminal activity, but will falsely report millions of innocent citizens as suspects. Meanwhile, criminals easily circumvent this system by deleting these apps from their phones or disappearing on the dark web. While ineffective, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson’s proposal does mean an end to private digital conversations for everyone and, for obvious reasons, is incompatible with the right to privacy and freedom of communication and the presumption of innocence.[5] On Thursday 14 September, it emerged that there is insufficient support in the Council of the European Union for her proposal.[6] Worryingly, a day later, on 15 September, the Commissioner commissioned a paid advertising campaign on X (formerly Twitter) targeting the Netherlands,[7] Sweden,[8] Belgium,[9] Finland,[10] Slovenia,[11] Portugal[12] and the Czech Republic,[13] countries that did not want to vote for the current proposal, according to leaked minutes from the 14 September meeting. The campaign, which has been viewed more than four million times, uses shocking images of young girls alongside sinister-looking men, ominous music, and commits a form of emotional blackmail by suggesting that opponents of the proposed legislation would not want to protect children.[14] Equally misleading is its claim that the proposed legislation would be supported by the majority of Europeans based on a survey that highlighted only the benefits but not the drawbacks of the proposed legislation. On the contrary, surveys by research firms YouGov[15] and Novus,[16] which highlighted the drawbacks, showed virtually no support for the proposal among the European population. To sway European public opinion, however, the European Commission went even further. X’s Transparency Report shows that the European Commission also used ‘microtargeting’ to ensure that the ads did not appear to people who care about privacy (people interested in Julian Assange) and eurosceptics (people interested in ‘nexit’, ‘brexit’ and ‘spanexit’ or in Victor Orbán, Nigel Farage, or the German political party AfD).[17] For unclear reasons, people interested in Christianity were also excluded. After excluding critical political and religious groups, X’s algorithm was set to find people in the remaining population who were indeed interested in the ad message, resulting in an uncritical echo chamber. This microtargeting on political and religious beliefs violates X’s advertising policy,[18] the Digital Services Act[19] – which the Commission itself has to oversee – and the General Data Protection Regulation. If there is insufficient support for a proposed legislation, the only proper democratic response is to withdraw it or, as Germany suggested, to amend the proposal so that it does have sufficient support, in this case not introducing the unconstitutional “telescreen”, which seems to come straight out of Orwell’s book. And not, as the Commission has now tried to do, put pressure on doubting member states by trying to bend the views of their citizens to its will with tactics eerily reminiscent of the disinformation campaigns during the US elections[20] and Brexit,[21] such as the use of manipulative advertising, misleading statistics and micro-targeting based on religion and belief. By setting aside European values in its quest to push through a controversial piece of legislation, the Commission is not only doing a disservice to the citizens it represents, but also endangering the foundations of the Union itself. Therefore, the European Commission should take the ad campaigns offline and keep them offline, and refrain from future attempts to bend European public opinion to its will with manipulative disinformation campaigns through illegal ads on social media.

Those people need to devote your time and energy to prevent such thing.So far it sounds good but after the dust settles the same politicians and lobbysts bring the thing again this time with another name or sneakily group it into some other law. Perhaps something bad happened and that momentarily gained public support, of course with lots of emotions involved and very little context given to the common folk.The politicians and lobbyists are literally being paid for this. You are not. They can pretty much push the same bullshit forever until it stays while you are devoting your life to prevent it. reply wkat4242 16 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s nothing new for the EU. They tried to pass software patents through a meeting of agricultural ministers.

It had already been agreed (correctly, at a competitiveness meeting of the council) that it would go back to the parliament.They sent it through the fisheries Commission because the board that had the responsibility for it wasn&#x27;t due to meet for another 6 months.I guess some people care deeply about the details of which commission sends the proposed legislation to the parliament to be debated & amended &#x2F; rejected, but in reality I think it doesn&#x27;t really matter. In either case the correct thing for the commission to do was send the legislation to the parliament. reply pas 15 hours agorootparentprevit wouldn&#x27;t have become law. it sounds fishy (because it was at the meeting of agriculture and fisheries, eheh), but the EU Parliament would had to vote on it anyway. reply jjav 3 hours agoparentprev> bring the thing again this time with another nameThere should ideally be a rule that if an idea doesn&#x27;t pass it can&#x27;t be brought up again for 4 years.

But on the bright side, we would be able to correct for bad legislation much faster. reply logicchains 17 hours agorootparent>I wonder what would happen if there were not politicians, if the parliament of Europe were the sum of all its citizens voting for laws in some sort of mega-stack-overflow consensus systemThere&#x27;s another way to achieve something similar less chaotically: demarchy, which was used for some things in ancient Greece. This involves electing people at random for a limited time period; if the selection is truly random, then the outcome of a couple hundred randomly selected people voting on something should usually match the outcome of the whole population voting on something. And due to it only being for a short period of time, you avoid anyone accumulating too much power. reply breuleux 16 hours agorootparentAnother advantage is that if you pay random citizens full time to oversee the government, they will be able to talk and negotiate with each other directly, they will have the time to actually study and think about the issues, and they will be able to subpoena the information they need to take good decisions.If you want people to vote meaningfully on issues, you have to empower them to cast the very best vote they could cast, and demarchy is basically the only way this could be done practically in a large society. The concept of a general election or general referendum is aberrant. reply noman-land 16 hours agorootparentprevI think you&#x27;re basically describing the Byzantine fault tolerant consensus mechanisms used by blockchains. reply jltsiren 13 hours agorootparentprevIt would be chaos, and the real power would shift to the administrators.If you select people at random, they will have even less understanding of the issues they vote on than career politicians. They don&#x27;t have established networks of experts they believe they can trust. They lack the skills to have effective meetings between more than a handful of people, to negotiate, and to make collective decisions. Administrators would have to provide all that.That would be bureaucracy in the literal sense of the word. reply Rzor 9 hours agorootparent>If you select people at random, they will have even less understanding of the issues they vote on than career politicians.This reminds me of Varoufakis wanting to take the issue to the Greeks, during the Greek bailout negotiations, being told that he was \"putting [his] people in a difficult situation of having to make a pivotal decision on complicated matters\". He replied \"Yes, it&#x27;s called democracy\". reply roenxi 12 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;d need to be some filtering before people take office. I like the idea of randomly selecting a small pool of candidates then voting within that pool. Maybe people elect and elector who&#x27;s job it is to sit for 12 months just assessing people to hold actual power.Career politicians are better than monarchs or aristocrats, but the fact is that making governance decisions is technically easy. Anyone can do it in principle. Politicians literally don&#x27;t understand what they are voting on because the breadth of topics is too large and famously the US Congress can go from proposing to voting on complex trillion-dollar spending bills [0] in 48 hours. There is literally no way a random pool of people can do worse than that.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Consolidated_Appropriations_Ac... reply jltsiren 12 hours agorootparentThe two-party system in the US probably works in a different way than the multi-party system in the EU.In the EU, and especially in national parliaments, political parties are the primary actors. While individual politicians are often ignorant of the topics they vote on, the parties usually have the relevant expertise, though they are not always willing to take advantage of it. After all, one of the primary functions of a political party is to provide a pool of resources and trusted expertise that is independent both from the government and lobbyists. reply roenxi 11 hours agorootparentThese two positions are sitting in contradiction to each other. People chosen by lot are said to lead to administrators making the decisions and that would be bad ... but career politicians govern by giving decision making power to an administrator making the decision and that that is good. I don&#x27;t think your original comment got to the heart of what you don&#x27;t like about demarchy.Furthermore, I personally just flat out don&#x27;t believe \"parties usually have the relevant expertise\". What exactly, in detail, is that supposed to mean? Because as I&#x27;ve never seen that technical expertise coming out of a political party. reply jltsiren 10 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s all about checks and balances. When elected representatives have experts of their own, experts whom they trust, they are not as much at the mercy of the government and the lobbyists.It&#x27;s the same thing as with elections. You can trust the elections without trusting the government running them, because the party you vote has its own people overseeing the elections. And it&#x27;s always a party you vote, even in systems where you nominally cast your vote for an individual candidate, because individuals acting on their own are too weak to challenge the system.The experts you are aware of may be members of a political party, participating in the internal processes of the party to varying degrees. It&#x27;s one way to be an active citizen. You usually don&#x27;t know that, because it&#x27;s not your business to know. Political affiliation is a private matter, after all. reply logicchains 10 hours agorootparentprev>If you select people at random, they will have even less understanding of the issues they vote on than career politiciansThis isn&#x27;t necessarily true. Politicians aren&#x27;t selected for understanding; their ability to obtain and retain power is entirely due to their ability to attract voters and make deals with other politicians. If you assume a normal distribution of traits, then when people are selected based on scoring a high percentile in just one trait (in this case, political charisma), on average they&#x27;ll be worse at other traits than if you&#x27;d selected a similar number of people completely randomly. reply jltsiren 9 hours agorootparentTraits may be normally distributed, but they are not independent. People who are good at something tend to be above average in other things.People have done some research on that in Finland. Due to mandatory military service, the vast majority of men have taken the same intelligence and personality tests. The research found that male politicians performed better in the intelligence test and were more likely to have favorable personality traits than men in the general population. The effect was already present among the candidates in local elections. The higher up you went, the more significant the effect became. reply jerojero 7 hours agorootparentCitizens assemblies, also called minipublics, have been trialed for years in many places and in many different topics.In real life these people do not produce legislation&#x2F;recommendations that are of less quality than politicians.I recommend a book called \"open democracy\" that goes into detail about this kind of decision making processes. The OCED has also done a lot of work and has a few reports on the matter too, if you look at their recommendations for \"the future of democracy\".Some big experiments in this area have been done in France as recent as a few months ago, in Ireland, in Iceland and the European union as a whole did a very big one a few years ago. reply ClumsyPilot 7 hours agorootparentprev> They don&#x27;t have established networksof corrupting lobbyists, that the main thing they are missing.The average age in the Senate is what, 65?

I&#x27;m still meeting people who thought they were voting against Uber and Lyft with that proposition.The ads were constant and incredibly misleading. And that was one issue. Every time these propositions come up, I can usually find 3 or 4 that are not what they seem (the Diveta props are similar but very different tactics afaict).If all state business was done this way it would be overwhelming to filter through it all. reply mcpackieh 15 hours agorootparentProp 22 was contrary to the interests of professional drivers, but probably in line with the interests of riders who benefit from drivers being exploited. When push comes to shove, a whole lot of people choose cheap service over their publicly espoused principles.For evidence of this, consider how many suburban boomers are eager to hire illegal immigrants to do lawn work around their McMansion for less than minimum wage. Most would probably tell you that minimum wage laws are good or that illegal immigrants should be deported (one or the other, depending on what side of the aisle they&#x27;re on...) but when push comes to shove they both choose the lowest bidding contractor to do their yardwork. After all, they aren&#x27;t yard-workers, just like most Californians aren&#x27;t uber drivers. reply Timon3 16 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve been thinking that maybe we need the opposite - a citizens veto. The threshold would have to be high enough to ensure it&#x27;s not abused by individual groups (maybe 2&#x2F;3rds?), but the ability for the population to decide against measures (maybe even individual parts of omnibus bills) would create new controls against overreach without completely throwing away the current system. reply notrlyskeptik 15 hours agorootparentNo-confidence votes by citizens to remove misbehaving politicians from the their position and the states payroll, including pensions &#x27;n stuff. reply Timon3 15 hours agorootparentI could see this leading to abuse through populism. A better way might be to track the number of vetoed laws brought in by each politician, and to have removal be an automatic consequence of too many. This would broaden the blast radius to everyone involved, making everyone accountable, while only going after repeat offenders. reply Tagbert 16 hours agorootparentprevPeople also become tired of engaging in the constant need to decide on various issues and disconnect. Legislator have to vote on hundreds of issues over the course of a year. Do you want to have to do a public vote every week? How do the people stay informed enough to understand the issues and options? How many times will they vote before it becomes too onerous and they stop participating? Then you just get the special interests voting on their issues.This happens a lot in the US in the primary elections. Everyone complains about the poor quality of Republican candidates and how they wish there were better options but the primary voter has already limited the field. reply layer8 17 hours agorootparentprevIt would be much worse, witch-hunt style. Propaganda would run rampant. Also, many wouldn’t trust the voting system, because they won’t believe many actual outcomes to possibly be representative.

But on the bright side, we would be able to correct for bad legislation much faster.There is a better way: Checks and balances.Suppose that in order to pass anything of this nature it had to go through more steps: The union legislature had to agree, then a majority of the member state legislatures had to agree, then the general public had to vote in favor of it too. But to repeal it, it only takes one of those.That doesn&#x27;t make it impossible for something terrible to happen -- in waves of populism everyone will vote for something terrible because to do otherwise is seen as siding with the \"enemy\" -- but it helps. Raises the threshold before something dangerous makes it into law.And it&#x27;s the easier path to repeal which is the thing we most lack. It should be much easier for bad laws to be removed. reply Gud 5 hours agorootparentprevSwitzerland has a direct democratic system. It works great for them.

This same process is how women&#x27;s suffrage, civil rights, gay rights, medical marijuana and many many many other smaller victories for rights have been enabled over the years. Each one of those was brought up by politicians and lobbyists time and time again, defeated time and time again, until one day it wasn&#x27;t and it stuck.Personally I think that smaller, decentralized, local government is the best way to minimize the harm of this nature, but I fully recognize that it also means every group must fight the same fight multiple times in multiple places in order to secure their rights all over, and that&#x27;s its own harm.But I can&#x27;t think of any way that you could \"permanently\" defeat \"bad\" bills that wouldn&#x27;t equally have harmed those other movements. reply Incipient 9 hours agorootparentBanning any form of paid lobbying, sponsorship, etc. All the politicians should be interested in are votes (eg the preference of the people).It won&#x27;t fix it, but it&#x27;ll help. reply tpmoney 7 hours agorootparent> Banning any form of paid lobbying, sponsorship, etc.The problem with this is then the only people that are able to meet with &#x2F; influence your representatives are the people that are independently wealthy enough to travel to them and take the time off from work to do so. If you can&#x27;t pay someone to speak on your behalf, and you can&#x27;t afford to take the time to speak for yourself, how do you get heard?

Usually to prevent actions you need total control or strong incentives.True. And because of this, you need to increase the incentives for your side: create a website that lists all politicians that are in favour of the dubious law by their individual names. Use a wording for these politicians that is not punishable by libel, but near to it. Even after such a law becomes passed, make sure that the politicians who voted in favour of it will spend the rest of their lives deeply regretting their decision in sorrow so that hardly any future politician will dare to vote for similar laws.Summarizingly: do everything in your power that the reputation of *every* politician who voted in favour of the law becomes *destroyed* in important segments of the society. reply antonvs 2 hours agorootparentThat’s more of a revenge fantasy than a viable political strategy.Of course, you’re not the first person to think of it - in fact, many people have tried this strategy, it’s one of the most common ones in politics. “Attack ads” are an example of it. And they’re effective, to an extent.But they also have a major negative aspect, which is that they reduce the importance of reputation - it becomes an unreliable indicator, because almost every politician’s reputation ends up “destroyed” as you put it.The problem is that people who disagree with you are just as capable of slandering the politicians you agree with as you are for the ones you disagree with. So you end up with a race to the bottom, with accusations becoming more and more hysterical, completely drowning any real signal, and teaching people to ignore it all as noise. reply scott_w 15 hours agorootparentprevIf that were true, how come NIMBYism is so successful? reply patmorgan23 6 hours agorootparentNIMBYs don&#x27;t win all the time.... And in a lot of places they do have near total control.NIMBYs are usually suburbanites, and if they&#x27;re in a smaller municipality they can exert a large amount of control over the city government and planning process. The auto dependent single family suburb has been heavily propagandized and ingrained in American culture that many times no one questions it, and those advocating for some walkable, or mixed use areas are in the minority.Just look at California, the state requires every city adopt and update a multipart plan for various purposes. One of those parts is called the \"Housing element\", it requires cities to plan and zone for a minimum amount of growth and affordable housing. over the last year or two many of these plans have come up for renewal and lots of the smaller (and especially more conservative) cities have been reluctant, or out right refused to meet the states requirements. They want to keep their car oriented suburban small community, affordability be Damned.The state did pass this fun law that created this thing called \"the builder&#x27;s remedy\". Where if a city does not have a compliant housing element the city loses its discretion and must approve any permit that meets its building code, sans any density requirements. And these rights vest, so even if the city latter approves a compliment those builders can still utilize those permits. (Carrot and stick approach to getting cities to comply)But this is only after decades of the California housing affordablility crisis growing and yimby advocates fighting for less restrictive zoning.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openscopestudio.com&#x2F;californias-zoning-holiday-what-...TL;DR NIMBYs are ussally the majority (or at least the louds and most engaged). reply godelski 11 hours agoparentprev> To combat this lots of people need to do activism. Those people need to devote your time and energy to prevent such thing.I think the issue is of complexity and energy. The world and a lot of these problems are often extremely complex and there are no optimal solutions. There is always slap, noise, and limits. Many of these things are also hard to understand and take a lot of time and energy to actually understand what is even seemingly simple.But the cost I believes to a lot of apathy. For example, how difficult is it to switch people to tools like Firefox or Signal? The noise is quite high and non-experts will not know how to navigate this. Even mentioning these two tools will cause controversy on sites like this with people pointing out the imperfections. But the truth is that these always exist (same thing politicians exploit) and the complaints just make non-experts confused. Yeah, there are things better than Signal but there&#x27;s no tool that is better for the masses and communication systems rely on people being on the same platform. The network effect.Which getting into the network effect is the quite disappointing part of many things in politics. We have a lot of people that operate under the notion \"if you don&#x27;t like it, then don&#x27;t use&#x2F;participate&#x2F;whatever.\" But this is not a realistic notion. As an example, I&#x27;ve used Firefox for over a decade and a lot has been to simply push against the Chrome domination. But that happened anyways and the thing is that Chrome still took over and Google has a lot of control over the internet. The truth is the differences in browsers isn&#x27;t really that large, but we become quite passionate about defending our decisions. The same is exactly true for political concepts. We can point out flaws in other systems&#x2F;ideas but do not weigh these equally when they are the thing we chose vs the other option. But the entire landscape is exceptionally complex and there are no optimal solutions.

Capital is more than money, and capital is what is abused. Capital can be your house, where you live, the food you eat, the clothes you wear, and so on.Regardless of ruling systems there are no (other than short lived) cases where this imbalance does not exist and creep larger. The reason I hate these \"yep that&#x27;s capitalism for yah\" comments is not that there aren&#x27;t things to criticize about capitalism (if you can&#x27;t criticize a system you&#x27;re in trouble) but because it hinders the ability to have this conversation. I&#x27;m sure the conditions will relax as we approach post scarcity but there is no possible means to have true equality on all levels. Capitalism, socialism, whatever, all need to have a real discussion about how to place people into power while minimizing the ability to influence those people while maximizing the ability to do good for people. Which some of these seem to be in direct opposition from one another.A part I see clearly missing is the temporal factor in all of this. It does not matter if you elect someone who is a saint if the environment will corrupt them. Nor is there a way to have an environment that is not rapidly changing. So how do you create a system that can adapt (be iterative) but not be influenced by those with more power&#x2F;capital?

I see people who are upset that Snowden would leak and provide visibility into government actions, but don&#x27;t blink that the revealed actions were actually the government spying on its own citizens. So governments are entitled to privacy, but their citizens are not?My interest is not one sided. I have an intuition that personal privacy is important in maintaining democracy. But I also have an intuition that institutional privacy for a government is harmful to democracy. I think most would argue that a reasonable amount of governmental privacy is important to national security. I tend to favor the bare minimum. Most people I know disagree with me on that. I enjoy exploring both sides and trying to move beyond intuition for my position.Any links or references to reasoned arguments on all sides are appreciated. reply try_the_bass 13 hours agoparent> I have an intuition that personal privacy is important in maintaining democracy.I don&#x27;t think this is true. People need social pressure of some kind to cooperate. It could be positive pressures like getting positive feedback from peers, or negative feedback in the form of shame from peers.Authenticity is important here, to ensure that one&#x27;s peers can provide accurate feedback (both positive and negative). Anonymity breaks this model, allowing people to pretend to have one viewpoint in order to reap the positive rewards, while simultaneously allowing them to dodge the negative feedback for antisocial behaviors.You needn&#x27;t look further than the behavior of pseudonymous commenters on the Internet to see this play out. So many \"normal\" people are capable of being complete assholes online because they&#x27;re able to hide those actions from those who can impose social consequences.I mean, if I found out a close friend was the kind of person who demonstrates the kind of casual cruelty that online trolls exude, I might stop being their friend.That&#x27;s not too say that the benefits of privacy are all bad. Vulnerable people certainly benefit greatly from privacy, especially in adversarial environments... But perhaps the answer in less adversarial environments (i.e. direct&#x2F;indirect democracies) more often isn&#x27;t \"more privacy\", but \"less judgement\"?The other framing for this question involves trust. Anonymity undermines trust, but trust is _required_ for coordinated action. From this perspective isn&#x27;t pretty obvious that democracies and privacy pursue opposing goals.Put differently, when it comes to voting, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to incentivize lying--or worse still, actively promote it as a positive. If making votes public causes negative externalities, perhaps there are solutions other than \"let people lie about how they vote\"? reply mcpackieh 16 hours agoparentprev> I am intrigued how often people with the attitude that if you aren&#x27;t don&#x27;t anything wrong you shouldn&#x27;t mind being observed apply that philosophy in only one direction.

Governments are required to protect their people and the reality of war necessitates the keeping of some secrets. Failure to recognize this reality would constitute an abdication of their duty as a government. On the other hand, private persons are not permitted to wage war (this is why governments are obliged to defend their people, because they forbid people from doing it themselves.) Since people are not allowed to wage war on their own, the \"realities of war\" justification for governments keeping secrets doesn&#x27;t justify people keeping personal secrets.Rebuttal to the above: throughout history and particularly in the 20th century, tens of millions of people were killed by their own government. While governments may need to keep some secrets to effectively defend their population against external threats, people also need the right to keep secrets from their government to defend themselves against that domestic threat, which is every bit as real and concerning as the external threats. reply dmcq2 18 hours agoprevThat is so awful, Britain is trying on this sort of thing too saying it is to protect children.

In order to have a Democracy you have to have free speech so that ideas can be freely exchanged with the good ideas beating out the bad ones at the ballot box. In Europe, speech is controlled by hate speech laws and government censorship thus the vote is also controlled and thus elections are not free thus there is no Democracy in Europe. This lack of Democracy is coming to a head in Germany where the rising AfD party is being spied on and physically assaulted by the German secret police controlled by the ruling coalition lead by the SPD.America is also experiencing similar problems of censorship and hate speech laws, the difference is in America censorship and hate speech laws are banned by the First Amendment and thus there&#x27;s at least a chance that the Supreme Court can restore Democracy.

Corruption at national level seems however much more common, see recent stories on Bavarian backroom deals and kickbacks during COVID. Nothing at that scale or brazenness seems to ever happen in Brussels. reply dalbasal 13 hours agorootparentYes, corruption at national (and subnational) levels is much greater.EC institutions don&#x27;t control enough programs, funds or building permits to rival states on this front.I do think there is \"soft\" corruption (as OP alludes) in the \"EU as a regulatory powerhouse\" complex. Lobby-adjacent corruption, like in the US. A lot of that is very dirty money, with foreigns states or industries literally buying a seat at the table. The cleaner end is Google & Apple getting a seat at the table via ireland (and others) who simply have a national interest in giving it to them. The dirtier is Qatar, China or whatnot getting proxied in for political donations, payola, funding of specific nonprofits&#x2F;etc.Anyway... that exists. It is (IMO) almost entirely contained at the top level, and it mostly bleeds in from national politics.OTOH, competence and professionalism also exists in the EC. That means the can actually deliver on the job, if they&#x27;re tasked with a good job.The EU has very little advocacy or awareness of digital freedom. Foreign ministry staff don&#x27;t understand it at all. We&#x27;re just a stream of weirdo complaints that appears whenever they try to do anything digital related. I know it&#x27;s hard to grok, but they do not have any idea what we are talking about... and that&#x27;s kind of our fault. Democracy has some essential bottom up components.On the positive side... a sound, rational and tactical movement can (IMO) really succeed and get stuff. The good thing about eurocrats, is that once they&#x27;re mission is the right mission... they get it done better than most. EU consumer protection, for example, is quite excellent relative to any examples I know.

Talks In rough order of recommended viewing or difficulty, intro to more advanced: 1. Linux Systems Performance (USENIX LISA 2019) This is my summary of Linux systems performance in 40 minutes, covering six facets: observability, methodologies, benchmarking, profiling, tracing, and tuning. It's intended for everyone as a tour of fundamentals, and some companies have indicated they will use it for new hire training. A video of the talk is on usenix.org and youtube, and the slides are on slideshare or as a PDF. For a lot more information on observability tools, profiling, and tracing, see the talks that follow. 2. Linux Performance 2018 (PerconaLive 2018) This was a 20 minute keynote summary of recent changes and features in Linux performance in 2018. A video of the talk is on youtube, and the slides are on slideshare or as a PDF. 3. Linux Performance Tools (Velocity 2015) At Velocity 2015, I gave a 90 minute tutorial on Linux performance tools, summarizing performance observability, benchmarking, tuning, static performance tuning, and tracing tools. I also covered performance methodology, and included some live demos. This should be useful for everyone working on Linux systems. If you just saw my PerconaLive2016 talk, then some content should be familiar, but with many extras: I focus a lot more on the tools in this talk. A video of the talk is on youtube (playlist; part 1, part 2) and the slides are on slideshare or as a PDF. This was similar to my SCaLE11x and LinuxCon talks, however, with 90 minutes I was able to cover more tools and methodologies, making it the most complete tour of the topic I've done. I also posted about it on the Netflix Tech Blog. 4. How Netflix Tunes EC2 Instances for Performance (AWS re:Invent, 2017) Instead of performance observability, this talk is about tuning. I begin by providing Netflix background, covering instance types and features in the AWS EC2 cloud, and then talk about Linux kernel tunables and observability. A video of the talk is on youtube and the slides are on slideshare: 5. Container Performance Analysis (DockerCon, 2017) At DockerCon 2017 in Austin, I gave a talk on Linux container performance analysis, showing how to find bottlenecks in the host vs the container, how to profiler container apps, and dig deeper into the kernel. A video of the talk is on youtube and the slides are on slideshare. 6. Broken Linux Performance Tools (SCaLE14x, 2016) At the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE 14x), I gave a talk on Broken Linux Performance Tools. This was a follow-on to my earlier Linux Performance Tools talk originally at SCaLE11x (and more recently at Velocity as a tutorial). This broken tools talk was a tour of common problems with Linux system tools, metrics, statistics, visualizations, measurement overhead, and benchmarks. It also includes advice on how to cope (the green \"What You Can Do\" slides). A video of the talk is on youtube and the slides are on slideshare or as a PDF. 7. Using Linux perf at Netflix (Kernel Recipes, 2017) At Kernel Recipes 2017 I gave an updated talk on Linux perf at Netflix, focusing on getting CPU profiling and flame graphs to work. This talk includes a crash course on perf_events, plus gotchas such as fixing stack traces and symbols when profiling Java, Node.js, VMs, and containers. A video of the talk is on youtube and the slides are on slideshare: There's also an older version of this talk from 2015, which I've posted about. To learn more about flame graphs, see my flame graphs presentation. 8. Give me 15 minutes and I'll change your view of Linux tracing (LISA, 2016) I gave this demo at USENIX/LISA 2016, showing ftrace, perf, and bcc/BPF. A video is on youtube (sorry, the sound effects are a bit too loud):. This was the first part of a longer talk on Linux 4.x Tracing Tools: Using BPF Superpowers. See the full talk video and talk slides. 9. Performance analysis superpowers with Linux eBPF (O'Reilly Velocity, 2017) This talk covers using enhanced BPF (aka eBPF) features added to the Linux 4.x series for performance analysis, observability, and debugging. The front-end used in this talk is bcc (BPF compiler collection), an open source project that provides BPF interfaces and a collection of tools. A video of the talk is on youtube, and the slides are on slideshare or as a PDF. 10. Linux Performance Analysis: New Tools and Old Secrets (ftrace) (LISA 2014) At USENIX LISA 2014, I gave a talk on the new ftrace and perf_events tools I've been developing: the perf-tools collection on github, which mostly uses ftrace: a tracer that has been built into the Linux kernel for many years, but few have discovered (practically a secret). A video of the talk is on youtube, and the slides are on slideshare or as a PDF. In a post about this talk, I included some more screenshots of these tools in action. 11. Performance Checklists for SREs (SREcon, 2016) At SREcon 2016 Santa Clara, I gave the closing talk on performance checklists for SREs (Site Reliability Engineers). The later half of this talk included Linux checklists for incident performance response. These may be useful whether you're analyzing Linux performance in a hurry or not. A video of the talk is on youtube and usenix, and the slides are on slideshare and as a PDF. I included the checklists in a blog post. Resources Other resources (not by me) I'd recommend for the topic of Linux performance: Performance analysis & tuning of Red Hat Enterprise Linux - 2015 Red Hat Summit (video 2hrs): this is a great and in-depth tour of Linux performance tuning that should be largely applicable to all Linux distros. Linux Instrumentation: slides from a great talk in June 2010 by Ian Munsie, which summarizes the different Linux tracers very well. If you're trying to understand all the tracers and frameworks, this is worth studying (keeping in mind it's from 2010). Julia Evans blog has many posts about many topics, including performance tools.

That&#x27;s understandable, because performance for a lot of people is about bandwidth. But there are some of us for whom bandwidth definitely takes a back seat, and you need a different set of tools for tuning latency in Linux. reply dan-robertson 15 hours agoparentThat’s a pretty reasonable point. It’s much easier to increase bandwidth than latency too[1] so often caring about latency can be important.0. Another thing people may want to optimise for is performance per watt, but I won’t say much more about it.1. There are cases where bandwidth optimisations are latency optimisations, eg if you can fit more of your processes onto one box, you are reducing the average distance between the processes and whatever they talk to and hence average latency2. A very obvious thing to do when optimising for latency is increase bandwidth enough that the bandwidth doesn’t throttle you3. I feel like mostly if you are aggressively optimising latency, there isn’t much Linux tuning to do. Maybe I’m wrong – I don’t really know much about this – but I think it’s mostly pinning to a core, running tickles, doing user space networking, and then hardwarey things like tuning page size, SMT, power-saving settings, and other things like choice of hardware.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pdfs.semanticscholar.org&#x2F;bce7&#x2F;5f78d340cac32dccd8631f... reply toast0 13 hours agoparentprevI would say throughput rather than bandwidth, although the meaning is similar, people have been discussing throughput vs latency for a long time.Sometimes you can improve both, but often it&#x27;s a tradeoff. reply meisel 15 hours agoparentprevWhat are the tools and resources you would recommend with respect to latency tuning? reply interroboink 12 hours agorootparentNot the person you asked, but generally you might want to look at \"frame-based\" profilers. These are typically used in video games, but the concept is general, and can apply to other applications. The \"frame\" could also be something like a request or transaction being processed. I like Tracy[1], myself.Another latency metric that you&#x27;ll see, often w&#x2F;respect to web apps and microservices is \"P99\" and similar. This is the amount of time in which 99% of requests get their response. For a higher percentile, you get a better idea of worst-case performance.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wolfpld&#x2F;tracy reply klysm 14 hours agorootparentprevLatency of what particular system? reply SkyMarshal 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s lots of info on tuning linux servers, both for throughput and latency, so how about for desktop workstation use cases? reply stefan_ 13 hours agoparentprevWith the caution that if your goal is to reduce latency for the realtime properties of your system, chances are that you can turn any number of different knobs on your out of the box Linux distribution but it will not result in a satisfactory system. reply spandextwins 18 hours agoprevDidn&#x27;t know Brendan Gregg was at Intel now.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brendan_GreggHe is also the star of the Shouting in the Data Center viral videohttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tDacjrSCeq4True genius! reply thanatos519 18 hours agoprevWaiting is also a good strategy!As of Linux 6.5, the scheduler understands that when one SMT \"core\" is busy, that means it might not be the best idea to schedule something on the the other \"core\", since it&#x27;s really just a single core with a very low cost context switch. This makes certain very-parallel things noticeably snappier for me, and I can see it on the CPU usage graphs.YMMV due to cache coherency and NUMA issues. :D reply sambazi 12 hours agoparentsimply disabling smt also gives the \"snappier\" effect for earlier kernels while thwarting some side-channel attacks and increasing power efficiency reply MonaroVXR 3 hours agorootparentI still,don&#x27;t know why my file explorer syart faster on my 4 core n95 intel vs 5700uSame goes for my dual core laptop vs quacore laptop, both same generation, but other one runs definitely hotter (4 core) reply dang 15 hours agoprevRelated:Linux Performance - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=13498485 - Jan 2017 (64 comments)Linux Performance - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=8205057 - Aug 2014 (22 comments) reply nickdothutton 16 hours agoprevIf you are of a mind to change a tuneable parameter yet cannot tell me why this tuneable will have the desired effect, or why it is so-set in the first place, then I will not allow you to change it (in prod).“Chesterton’s tuneable parameter”. reply klysm 14 hours agoparentEven if I could tell you a hypothetical reason, why not benchmark outside of prod anyway? reply Brian_K_White 12 minutes agorootparentEven in prod (sometimes) there is no other way to \"tell me if it will have the desired effect\". Changing something to see what happens, even in production, is not automatically wrong. It&#x27;s not automatically right either. It&#x27;s almost like there is no thoughtless simple rule that is always right. reply p5a0u9l 18 hours agoprevNicely done Brendan! Thank you, knowing Brendan’s work with eBPF, I take this as a way to more easily monitor and assess performance under different types of performance. Tweaking&#x2F;tuning comes with trade offs, and I usually end up optimizing one thing to the detriment of others..Side note, I’ve found btop a super useful replacement for glances, to have an all-in-one TUI view of system performance and loading. Wonder how much those dev(s) are leveraging this, and whether anything out there’s motivated to build better TUI monitoring tools.Every server I go on, first thing is, start up tmux, dedicate one window to btop. reply umvi 16 hours agoprevFor me, \"tuning\" linux for performance = disabling spectre&#x2F;meltdown mitigations (in this case compute nodes are running in a VPC with no internet access, so seems pretty low risk) reply Vecr 8 hours agoparentDepends on what CPU you are running, on Zen 4 it&#x27;s not supported to disable the mitigations and caused bugs&#x2F;crashes. I think they did fix that exact crash but I&#x27;d still not recommend it. New CPUs from both AMD and Intel are designed to be run with at least the default mitigations on. reply costco 11 hours agoprevBookmarked! This will be useful to me soon for something I&#x27;m working on.I haven&#x27;t read all the slides yet but one thing I was wondering was if you ever found any significant performance increases from kernel build options. In my Gentoo days when I would play around with build flags I would change kernel Makefile to use -O3 and apply a patch for -march=native. In hindsight, looking at some Phoronix benchmarks it appears this is actually harmful to a number of workloads. Curious if you ever found any cases otherwise. reply simne 12 hours agoprevUnfortunately for me, I have few times suffered with performance issues, and have not found good deep resource fast enough. For example, few times need to recompile FFMPEG or Unreal Engine, and have spent weeks for things, which on my hardware done in hours.Now bookmarked this immediately.Have not read deep, but from first view look good! reply spaintech 9 hours agoprevGreat site! I kind of have a predisposition to summarize linux performance, be it tuning or monitoring, taking a deep breath…This is such a depth subject, with a long list of variety of observability tools. At minimum, make sure you know deeply uptime, dmesg, and iostat. These are your friends to give you a glimpse into various system aspects like load, memory, CPU, and more, enabling a diagnostic overview of system health. This is what I call, the “let me take a look at it” check list, 1st page of 100!When emphasizing methodologies for performance analysis I recommend careful benchmarking to holistically evaluate system behavior and workload characteristics. with before and after scenarios. Make smaller changes first, then gradually compound what you think will provide benefits. Remember, labs and production never behave the same.This is where it gets tricky, CPU profiling with tools like “perf” and visual aids like flame graphs enable targeted analysis of CPU activity, along with tracking hardware events to optimize computational efficiency. You need to know more than “it’s the app man, was fine until the latest release from development”When you are the admin and speaking to a developer; Linux, tools like ftrace and BPF come into play, allowing for detailed tracking of kernel function execution and system calls, which can be vital in troubleshooting and performance optimization. You can also be the developer, varying the admin’s intuition… as the saying goes, trust but verify.When it’s your code, then you better know BPF! It not only facilitates efficient in-kernel tracing but also propels the development of advanced custom profiling tools through bcc and bpftrace, offering deeper insights into system performance.Last comment, it’s %$$% hard! Tuning means you need to navigate through adjusting a myriad of system components and kernel parameters, from CPUs and memory to network settings, aiming to optimize performance and reliability across various system workloads, else you can blame it on the network! :DReally, you need to have a good behavioral attitude at change management, as chasing code or kernel parameters could be a daunting task that just overwhelms everyone in a moment where you might be time constrained and the preasure could lead to a higher degree of human errors. reply jtriangle 18 hours agoprevCurrent kernel and current distro tuning is almost always folly unless there&#x27;s a specific issue you&#x27;re trying to work around.Trying to squeeze a little more juice out of something is bound to come at the detriment of something else, or worse, break something else in unexpected ways.Basically, if the tunables aren&#x27;t obvious in whatever default config you&#x27;re using, the issue isn&#x27;t in that config, it&#x27;s that you&#x27;re asking too much of your hardware and just need better hardware. reply toast0 13 hours agoparent> Current kernel and current distro tuning is almost always folly unless there&#x27;s a specific issue you&#x27;re trying to work around.Of course there&#x27;s no reason to tune if stock works fine. Plenty of people buy or a rent a reasonable computer and it has more than enough capacity for their work with default tuning. That&#x27;s fine.But when you run out of CPU or memory or X, it&#x27;s often a good idea to see if there&#x27;s reasonable things you can do to get more out of the hardware you already have. Depending on what you&#x27;re doing, there&#x27;s often a lot of room for improvement.For some networking tasks, doing proper alignment of threads and work with Receive Side Scaling or similar can make a tremendous improvement in capacity versus naive threads. In some environments, the bandwidth costs when you&#x27;re using enough capacity to see that mean that machine costs of doing it well versus naively don&#x27;t matter, so you may as well do it naively and spend your engineering time elsewhere. In other environments, gettingthe same work done with 10% of the nodes is valuable.Also, in many cases, better hardware needs more tuning, rather than less. You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of time avoiding cross core communication on an 8-core single socket machine. But if you get a dual-socket, 128-core per socket machine and you&#x27;re not careful about cross socket communication, you&#x27;ll spend a lot of CPU on memory arbitration (which you&#x27;ll have to know or learn how to look for) reply jeffbee 18 hours agoparentprev> just need better hardware.That&#x27;s .. yeah, that&#x27;s completely false. I can think of dozens of things that are not right out of the box on any distro, on any hardware, in common practice. For example suppose you roll out Ubuntu on an EC2 instance, say a c6i.16xlarge, a 32C&#x2F;64T, single-socket x86 server with a Nitro ENA. Where are the netrx interrupts delivered? Is RSS on&#x2F;working? RPS, XPS? Interrupt coalescing? The distro can&#x27;t make optimal choices for all use cases, but what they ship by default is a config that&#x27;s not optimal for any use case. Literally nobody would consciously choose the defaults after thinking it over. reply bravetraveler 14 hours agorootparentMost common example I can think of is &#x27;net.core.somaxconn&#x27;. The default limit out of the box is laughably small. Has been for decades at this point. reply Jach 12 hours agorootparentIs 4096 still too small over 128? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.kernel.org&#x2F;pub&#x2F;scm&#x2F;linux&#x2F;kernel&#x2F;git&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;lin... reply bravetraveler 5 hours agorootparentNope, that&#x27;s pretty decent... this still hasn&#x27;t made it to the distributions we&#x27;re using, though.

Your beast serving&#x2F;copying tons of data concurrently might not be the best one to play that Vulkan&#x2F;GL 4.5 game without frequent slowdowns. reply dijit 21 hours agoprevThe issue with performance is that junior sysadmins and developers start flipping knobs thinking that the defaults are somehow holding them back.The truth is usually there are tradeoffs and the defaults fit a broad general case.If you want throughput there are tunables for that, if you want low latency then usually those are inversely correlated. Same for tuning for low data loss after failure and so on.You have to spend time learning the tradeoffs, which sysadmins used to do- now nobody has time as they have been munged into one role at many places. reply karmakaze 19 hours agoparentThis broad case is much broader than the typical servers that Linux is often used for. A simple example is file access times on a (database) server. These are largely unnecessary. It&#x27;s even rare for a desktop user to actually look at these.In the past I&#x27;ve been a sr dev (but a jr sysadmin) and was tasked with improving the performance of an upgraded database server. The problem turned out to be with NUMA on the larger server which a combination of reading and semi-random config fiddling of both Linux and MySQL parameters (plus a bit of BIOS&#x2F;CMOS tweaking) brought up to expected levels.There&#x27;s often no better way than learning on the job as there is so much to know that you can&#x27;t simply learn them up front for when you will need it. What we can do is learn what there is to know and remember to look into those if it seems relevant. I mean everyone who&#x27;s well experienced now probably started config twiddling somewhere to get there. reply js2 17 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s a right and a wrong way to learn though. The wrong way, which is the one I most often see is: smash keys until it appears to work w&#x2F;o every bothering to try to understand the deeper problem or why some particular combination of key smashing appears to work. This becomes cargo culting over time. Stack Overflow and ChatGPT make this oh so much worse. Often the change then get committed with a useless message such as \"make thing work\" w&#x2F;o any explanation of what was broken, what the change fixed, and why or how. It becomes instant tech debt.The right way is to follow the scientific method. Collect data. Make a hypothesis with a plausible mechanism of action. Test the hypothesis. Arrive at a solution. Record how you arrived at your new found knowledge so that those who follow you understand why you made the change. The person who follows you is your future self as often as not. reply unmole 17 hours agorootparentprev> A simple example is file access times on a (database) server.This isn&#x27;t a issue if you use `relatime` which is the default. reply pflanze 16 hours agorootparentTo give context for those who don&#x27;t know: relatime is a relatively (I&#x27;m a dinosaur) newer introduction into the Linux kernel; mounting partitions noatime used to be the only alternative to the default which was updating the atime on every access, thus fiddling with that setting used to be important. Not any more.BTW I used to continue to mount everything noatime anyway, since having the atime field be set upon file creation and not anymore afterwards was a way to get file creation time, and I found that more useful than the access time. This isn&#x27;t necessary either anymore since the introduction of an actual file creation time. reply vbezhenar 18 hours agoparentprevThe truth is that often nobody thinks too much of defaults, unless they are horribly wrong. So there are two good things about defaults: they&#x27;re probably not horribly wrong and they don&#x27;t require any additional work.Some defaults are just historical curiosities, some defaults were configured 20 years ago and nobody took the crusade to update them, some might be bad, but changing them would break too much stuff in the wild.Now I&#x27;m not suggesting that everyone should change everything. I almost never change defaults, myself. But I just don&#x27;t agree than defaults are good. They&#x27;re probably not bad, and that&#x27;s about it. reply eduction 21 hours agoparentprevThat may be, but Brendan Gregg is not a junior flipping switches, and a resource like this can help others do smart tuning. reply dijit 21 hours agorootparentI didnt expect anyone would read my comment that way.No, Brendan Gregg is certainly no junior. The issue is that people take his advice as law and do not read further.I, myself, remember flipping random switches because a (book) resource said that it would unlock performance.I’m suggesting that taking the time to understand performance properly is ideal and I am attempting to urge people to properly invest the time.Then I am lamenting the fact that we do not actually have time over because there’s so much smushing of responsibilities. reply eduction 21 hours agorootparentAh fair enough, sorry if I misunderstood! reply traceroute66 20 hours agorootparentprev> Brendan Gregg is not a junior flipping switchesThat&#x27;s because Brendan Gregg doesn&#x27;t flip switches, he shouts at hard drives[1]. ;-)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tDacjrSCeq4 reply pmcf 17 hours agorootparentI do the same thing to my kids to change their performance. reply cinntaile 16 hours agorootparentDoes it work? reply bornfreddy 16 hours agorootparentNot GP, but no, it doesn&#x27;t. It appears to work but then side effects get much worse. Taking the time to understand and to tweak the right settings, I mean, explain, is much better in the long run. replynimbius 19 hours agoparentprevthough i dont know much about it, i run linux and most of the documents i hear about tuning edge cases are now either avoided or boilerplated with a strong word of caution. For example: 10Gb ethernet used to require a litany of sysctl.conf chicanery to even approach half the line speed. not the case anymore, and most of the old kernel 2.4 optimisations are either nonsensical in 2023 or actively worsen the performance of the interface. reply tyingq 19 hours agoparentprev> The truth is usually there are tradeoffs and the defaults fit a broad general case.Part of the problem is that reasonable defaults for performance is a somewhat new phenomenon. It used to be that the defaults for Linux kernel settings, Apache, MySQL, etc... were terrible for production use.So there&#x27;s a lot of history that \"you have to change them\" burned into people minds, documents, etc. reply ranting-moth 16 hours agoparentprevThe problem you&#x27;re explaining can be generalized:\"Junior X starts flipping knobs thinking Y is somehow holding him back\"This is sadly how many of us have to learn. If you don&#x27;t have a mentor or someone to check your work, it&#x27;s a way to learn.Experience will tell you not to make bad decision.

So I&#x27;m not sure that this piece of advice is good. reply efortis 20 hours agoparentprevI wouldn&#x27;t say that that&#x27;s a performance tuning, seniority, or even smart people problem. I&#x27;ve seen smart people blindy tuning knobs. Similarly, switching to an expensive O(1) algorithm for a tiny space. It beats me, but I think the problems are closer to lazyness or trying to discredit something. reply jeffbee 17 hours agoparentprev> defaults fit a broad general case.Yeah, they fit the general case of a MIPS R4400 with a 1mbps network adapter, a situation that nobody faces today. I think the most glaring example is `rmem_max` which is never sufficient to support a coast-to-coast 1gbps flow, and every individual Linux user in history has needed to independently discover this stupid sysctl. reply SkipperCat 19 hours agoprev [–] Gregg&#x27;s book \"Systems Performance\" was a real game changer for me.

Once is already arguable. reply dessant 11 hours agorootparentThe constant nagging when you tell Google \"no\" shows how little respect they have for their users. Messages by Google, which is primarily an SMS app, is asking me every 1-2 weeks to enable RCS chats. The link for declining the request is small and easy to miss, while the AGREE button below it takes up 25% of the area of the popup.Dear Google UX designers, the way you present your little \"decline\" links is illegal in the EU. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve got these design directives from a product manager, but you can still say \"no\" to breaking the law. reply berdario 11 hours agorootparentI dislike how there&#x27;s no complete open source RCS implementation, and after trying it out a few years ago, I now actively avoid it (I instead use QKSMS on Android)...But I don&#x27;t see the problem with the decline link and EU law?AFAIK, most EU regulations are about tracking and consent in using your information...In this case, you&#x27;re already using a Google product (the Messages app), and Google is just (aggressively) nudging you to use extra features that they have shipped in their app. It doesn&#x27;t follow that Google is definitely going to use more information to track you than it would&#x27;ve done before (though it could be possible, of course)...of course, I fully agree that this doesn&#x27;t embody their \"respect the user\" ethos, but frankly... If you worked on new features for your users, I think it&#x27;s fair to nudge them to try to make sure that what you worked on will end up benefitting them (of course, a company behaves differently than an individual, and it&#x27;s not guaranteed that the work done might actually have merit... But that&#x27;s orthogonal to this discussion) reply dessant 9 hours agorootparentPersonal data is shared with Google and the carrier, that&#x27;s why they need to ask for consent to enable the feature.Here&#x27;s the consent popup: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;PIqcDgRThe design of such consent popups has been deemed illegal in the EU, Google was also previously fined [1] for a similar consent popup. The \"REJECT\" button needs to be just as accessible and needs to have about the same visual weight as the \"ACCEPT\" button, dark patterns like the ones you see in the RCS consent popup above are illegal.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2022&#x2F;1&#x2F;7&#x2F;22871719&#x2F;france-fines-goog... reply flykespice 7 hours agorootparentprev> Dear Google UX designers, the way you present your little \"decline\" links is illegal in the EU.

I do wish the permission to install&#x2F;uninstall were separated for something like this (I may be naive). I have everything installed to a work profile in Android (using the Shelter app). I can globally pause all work-profile apps. It&#x27;s not the best, because when unpaused I&#x27;m not getting some notifications. I need to figure that out. reply Brian_K_White 13 hours agorootparentGraphene is not acceptable either, since it requires putting trust in someone who does not exibit enough stability or rationality to justify that kind of trust. I mean it&#x27;s only the keys to your whole life, no big. reply paravirtualized 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;m curious about the \"trust\" discussion that keeps being brought up here. What does GrapheneOS do differently from say, Debian GNU&#x2F;Linux or Fedora?It seems to me that it&#x27;s no different than running a non-Microsoft&#x2F;Apple operating system on desktop. reply gerdesj 11 hours agorootparentprev\"I mean it&#x27;s only the keys to your whole life, no big.\"It&#x27;s a telephone, with a computer on it in your pocket with a shit load of sensors. The computer part involves components from many parts of the world, with many opaque subsystems. The OS is sort of Linux with knobs on and a lot of opaque parts - the first layer \"belongs\" to a prolific ad slinger hell bent on knowing everything about you. Then if it isn&#x27;t a Google jobbie, it will have another layer of software, lots more shiny and a lot more data gathering (eg Xiomi&#x2F;Samsung&#x2F;whatevs). Then your \"TSP\" gets to put their spin on it. All three layers can sell out to eg MS for yet more data gathering and ads and profiling and so on.Apple does the same but manages to be layers 1 and 2 and be a bit cooler about the whole thing.You worry about Graphene?I don&#x27;t advocate for full Luddite (I run an IT company) but please get some perspective. If you are concerned about Graphene, I suggest a burner feature phone or smoke signals.EDIT: I have F-Droid and KDE Connect wired up to both of my Arch (actually) boxes on my Samsung Invasive Intruder ... sorry Galaxy S23. I&#x27;ll try switching out the Play version of Connect for the F-Droid one and see what happens. reply Brian_K_White 10 hours agorootparentThe fact that other things like the carrier are bad, does not somehow make any other thing like graphene good. (not that it&#x27;s bad exactly just that there is a problem, which is not no problem, even if it&#x27;s a problem you personally have just decided to be ok with)Someone else said that the head guy isn&#x27;t the head guy any more so the biggest problem may not be a problem any more. The idea, stated ideal, design, & construction (as far as one can tell honestly) of the os are all fine.But the point was, you don&#x27;t need any more reason than his behavior to avoid granting him such a priviledged place in your phone, which holds such a priviledged place in your life. Just on basic principle. You don&#x27;t need to justify that to anyone and he or the project does need to justify why one should trust them. The usual justification is merely the utterly flimsy weak one of benefit of the doubt. It&#x27;s more or less impractical to actually vet strangers, and so you just grant benefit of the doubt until there is some reason to question. But that goes out the window the instant there IS any reason to question.People have different tolerance for risk, and so, you might be fine with saying \"that guy is acting a little weird in this way, but whatever, probably he can still be counted on in this other way.\", but no one else is obligated to. And this example of \"weird\" was not just neutral irrelevant non-conformity.There have been countless examples of people in positions of responsibility and trust going off the rails and taking a bunch of users down with them. There is no reason not to use your nose for what it&#x27;s meant for in this way.But like I said, maybe the problem is resolved now by the fact that we don&#x27;t actually have to trust that guy any more. In which case, ok. reply smeej 7 hours agorootparentLast I checked, GrapheneOS is open source.Don&#x27;t trust. Verify. reply Brian_K_White 6 hours agorootparentWhy? There are other equally open source os&#x27;s I can just run instead, that don&#x27;t require me to excuse or verify anything?Even if there were something special about graphene that made it more desirable, the real way to deal with an open source project with something unacceptable about it&#x27;s production or management, is to fork it. But I already have something else to do all day, and am happy to run lineage or calyx or or others. If I did need a fork, I&#x27;d need someone else to do it, and I&#x27;d have to trust them.Fork it or help someone else who is forking it or work towards changing the original (which is what seems to have happened actually, so this is all a bit academic now), or just use anything else, are all more reasonable responses than \"the people producing this thing with access to all my communications have shown themselves to be off the rails, so what I&#x27;ll do is keep using it, but personally read all the code in an entire android os.\" reply gerdesj 11 hours agorootparentprevI go into F-Droid and search for \"connect\". The product page says I updated it 15 days ago and offers an Uninstall option. It shows 1.29.0 as the latest version. So far it looks like a second package manager working properly.I hit Uninstall and within a few seconds the button switches to Install.I hit install and the app is installed from F-Droid. I open it and pair my phone to my laptop.One data point. Perhaps a knob has been twiddled in the Chocolate Factory in response to this article. There are a lot of Googlers here.(EDIT: formatting)EDIT2:I&#x27;ve gone into the Play app and got Play Protect to scan apps: \"No harmful apps found\". KDE Connect is still working reply wkat4242 12 hours agorootparentprevI agree but he&#x27;s not involved anymore since even Louis Rossman called him out on his behaviour.Edit: apparently according to a post below he&#x27;s still involved just not lead dev anymore. Sorry I missed that part. reply Brian_K_White 11 hours agorootparentOh, that actually changes things, assuming whoever steers things these days isn&#x27;t more or less the same.No denying the guy isn&#x27;t a no-joke developer, so, his code and work would be valuable, but only if the bigger picture didn&#x27;t depend on his judgement.It&#x27;s not that I have a specic scenario of a particular bad thing he might do, like make a backdoor for the government or secretly collect & sell data, or even something like somehow ban you from using as an individual he didn&#x27;t like because you criticized him or something. It&#x27;s that once someone is shown to be that irrational, then all bets are off. You don&#x27;t have to have a specific proposal of what they might do, because they might do anything.Anyone might do anything, and the only way you can function is you just have to trust other people, and the only thing you have to go on is very little in most cases. So you have to give strangers the benefit of the doubt until there is some reason to doubt. And this guy acting this way is more than enough to avoid. It&#x27;s not like there haven&#x27;t been countless examples of people who seemed good at first going off the rails and taking a bunch of users down with them. It is entirely valid to see this guy and go \"Nope. Avoid.\", and that would not be a case of just ignorant discrimination against non-conformity, it would be using your nose for what it&#x27;s for.But if we don&#x27;t actually have to trust him as much as before, that changes things. reply wkat4242 10 hours agorootparentI agree. He attacked me once out of the blue here because I said something good about CalyxOS, and said I was part of a CalyxOS-inspired conspiracy against him. For the record I&#x27;ve neither used CalyxOS nor GrapheneOS because I&#x27;ve never had a pixel phone.I was following CalyxOS&#x27; progress at the time because they were working on enabling support for some OnePlus models but right around that moment OnePlus came out with an update that made it impossible to do change the bootloader signing keys and they abandoned the project (which I understand). I&#x27;m also a huge fan of MicroG and really prefer this open-source approach over the sandboxed google play approach. And I&#x27;m critical about some of Graphene&#x27;s stances, around SafetyNet in particular (\"We don&#x27;t lie about security features\" - I don&#x27;t agree attestation is a security feature but in my opinion it&#x27;s more about control&#x2F;DRM). So yeah if I had a choice I probably would have gone for CalyxOS. But I&#x27;d never even heard of the guy before this happened. I had nothing to do with any hate campaign (which I doubt even exists).But no, I don&#x27;t want someone like that deciding what code goes on my phone. reply jrib 12 hours agorootparentprevCan you elaborate? reply fsflover 14 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37880628 reply TimeBearingDown 13 hours agorootparentIt’s still the best of all worlds for many people, a great intersection of privacy tool availability and general app usability. reply fsflover 47 minutes agorootparentI do not dispute that. If you have to run random untrusted apps, grapheneOS is more suitable. But it&#x27;s not a long-term solution. reply TwoNineFive 7 hours agorootparentprevI agree this is google doing evil and there should be government intervention for this kind of shit.There&#x27;s a timer that re-enables the Play Protect nag after a certain period of time.

I couldn&#x27;t use government or banking apps back in my old phone with LineageOS. reply sureglymop 1 hour agorootparentYou can run all of these apps with GrapheneOS, in that regard it&#x27;s very different than LineageOS because it has a compatibility layer as a first class feature [0]. You can either create a different user profile and install the play services there or create a work profile (with shelter) and install google services there. I keep my banking apps in a work profile and shelter completely freezes&#x2F;disables them when I&#x27;m not using them. Otherwise they work fine. I do want to note that I&#x27;m fine with only using apps from F-Droid in my main profile. I mostly use NewPipe, FairEmail, KeePass and Harmonic (HN client) and that&#x27;s about it. I don&#x27;t tend to create accounts on websites but if you use social media this setup will probably not be the most compatible. It&#x27;s honestly mind blowing though. I&#x27;ve never ran a custom ROM with such a \"vanilla\" experience, even getting OTA updates within a week of them being out for Android.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grapheneos.org&#x2F;faq#google-services reply nfriedly 15 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m running lineageOS, and I had to root the phone to make one banking app work (and Netflix and some games.)It actually passes SafetyNet out of the box, but there&#x27;s a CTS profile check that some apps do in addition to SafetyNet, and I had to root the phone to make it provide a profile that those apps are happy with. And then I had to install a SafetyNet bypass, because fixing the CTS profile broke SafetyNet.It un-roots itself every time I install an update, which is kind of a pain in the ass, but someone wrote a script to re-root lineageOS (from a desktop computer), so it&#x27;s not too bad these days. reply azalemeth 14 hours agorootparentWould you mind saying what phone you have, and which script? I&#x27;m using a (by now rather old) OnePlus 5 and potentially in the market for an upgrade -- and easy rootability is more my key feature than bling or a 50 megapixel camera.... reply nfriedly 14 hours agorootparentSure, I&#x27;m using a Moto g100 &#x2F; Edge S (different branding depending on where in the world it was purchased, but it&#x27;s the same hardware).And this is the script I&#x27;m using: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;NicolasWebDev&#x2F;reinstall-magisk-on-lineage...Overall I&#x27;m really happy with my g100. The bootloader was easy to unlock, it has a headphones jack, a microSD slot, the battery lasts 2-3 days, and the performance, screen, and cameras are all good enough that I don&#x27;t think about it.The only things that I don&#x27;t like are that the physical size is a larger than I would prefer, and it&#x27;s not waterproof. Additionally, the single down-firing speaker is kind of lame when compared to my previous phones stereo front-firing speakers above and below the screen. I&#x27;d much rather have a bit of bezel if it meant I could have stereo front-firing speakers (and no camera hole punches!)Oh, and I had to use a different phone to activate the SIM card to make it work on Verizon, because even though the phone is actually compatible with their network, they don&#x27;t like it for some reason. reply computerfriend 14 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m also hanging on to my OP5 on Lineage.

Even with all profiles I tried to load somehow most of those apps knew I was rooted. reply nfriedly 13 hours agorootparentOh, I didn&#x27;t mention it in the original post, but I&#x27;m also using magisk hide, or zygote, or whatever they&#x27;re calling it now.Additionally, I&#x27;ve blocklisted certain apps so that they&#x27;re not even allowed to request root access, because the banking app that forced me to root it in the first place would ask for root permission every time I launched it. reply redox99 12 hours agorootparentprevOnce google only accepts hardware attestation it&#x27;s over unfortunately reply madmads 14 hours agorootparentprevI use GrapheneOS daily and use banking, government, and other sensitive apps without problem. It&#x27;s a common myth that you can&#x27;t use those apps on GrapheneOS. reply lordofgibbons 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a myth. I run GrapheneOS, and my bank app doesn&#x27;t work, the Blind app doesn&#x27;t work, and another common marketplace app (not amazon) has shadow banned me for using it on a device without hardware attestation. I only found out after reaching out to support and having a lengthy conversation with them.It&#x27;s idiotic that they require hardware attestation, but let&#x27;s not fall into the trap of \"it worked for me\".Even with these limitations, I&#x27;m okay with continuing to run GrapheneOS. reply wkat4242 12 hours agorootparentEven the McDonald&#x27;s app doesn&#x27;t work if you install it through Aurora store lol. Even though it&#x27;s the same signed version distributed through Google play and I have Google play on the device, just not signed into a Google account.Somehow it detects that it was not installed through Google play and refuses to work with an explicit message stating this reason. I really wonder why they care. The app doesn&#x27;t even take payment, at least not in this country. You still have to pay at the order portal thing. reply treyd 14 hours agorootparentprevIn my experience, most banking apps are horrible and not worth using over accessing the bank&#x27;s browser version. reply _dain_ 13 hours agorootparentSome banks, especially newer ones, don&#x27;t even have a browser version.

These were all basic utility features than made a device interoperable and more generally functional. Removing them only benefits the people selling new phones, wireless headphones, and cloud storage.My old vaio 3 laptops ago is actually still perfectly fast enough at what I do today, it just only has usb2 ports, which eventually became too big of a pain point. But it also had a real docking station that you plop the machine into, not the stupid \"docks\" we have today that are not docks but just mega-dongle-hubs where you connect a usbc cable. I miss that dock every day since 5 years ago. I could easily still be using it today even though it must be 15 years old or more by now.

Even my old 2009 laptop* still runs an up-to-date OS but my 2016 phone is obsolete after 2-3 years?It is because computers run one of a few available OS&#x27;s. The OS is being maintained by the distributer (MS, Apple, Google) and your hardware is good as long as the drivers are still receiving updates.Phones are different because even though everyone only uses iOS or Android, every Android manufacturer puts their own layer onto Android, so Google can continusously update it but the manufacturer might not. Most companies only maintain their phones for about 3 years, giving a significantly reduced lifetime than computers.It still works fine, from from a security perspective, keeping the phone without patch support is a bad idea. reply HansHamster 15 hours agorootparentI mean, I know why it happens, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m happy about accepting it.It is really annoying how every vendor cobbles together a Frankenstein abomination of a kernel with just the right drivers and patches and good luck trying to run anything else. But I also understand that they (except maybe for Google) have no interest or incentive to clean up this mess. reply berdario 10 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true, and I think that we should be rewarding the companies that are bucking the trend:Fairphone 5 will receive security updates for 8 yearsPixel 8 will receive updates for 7 yearsiPhone 15 will receive updates for 6+ years (apparently, Apple has a track record of between 6 and 8 years) reply yjftsjthsd-h 12 hours agorootparentprevEven if your phone really has no access to anything that you wouldn&#x27;t want leaked (although most people would object to a third party having access to their phone calls, text messages, and location data), a compromised device is still a great way to launch attacks on other devices including taking part in botnets.

Even if they offer an online-banking website that you can access with any browser, you may still need the Android app for 2FA. This is one of a number of reasons why the PinePhone or Librem is unfortunately not a daily driver. Also, things like paying for parking or interacting with public services are moving to Android apps in some places. reply Kwpolska 19 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t most banking apps reject non-GooglePlay&#x2F;unofficial-image&#x2F;rooted phones? reply Arnt 19 hours agorootparentYes, and the reasons are instructive.When you get to the lowest level, technically, the banking apps want to store files on the phone that the user can&#x27;t access.This means that something like lineageos can run banking apps, if the phone tells the banking app what the app wants to hear. It&#x27;s fiddly but can be done, and in fact it is what I do on my private phone. It also means that a platform that fundamentally gives users the right to read all the files on the phone (ie. to make a complete backup) will not be supported by banking apps, because such a platform will not let the banks do what they think they need to do.I think this implies that such platforms can&#x27;t grow beyond a niche within a niche. reply user_7832 18 hours agorootparentWhile I can understand Google and the banking apps&#x27; actions, it doesn&#x27;t make much sense given how PCs having root is hardly every a concern for a bank. If you can do something bad with banking on a rooted device, it&#x27;s probably doable on a computer too. reply OfSanguineFire 18 hours agorootparentOh, banks are definitely concerned about PCs having root. There are even some banks that have removed their online banking websites entirely (except, perhaps, for corporate clients) and require customers to do everything through the Android app instead. reply Arnt 17 hours agorootparentMy bank and my wife&#x27;s bank both require 2FA. On the app, one of the Fs is having physical access to the device (the phone&#x2F;app, which was vetted by the bank when the app was installed). On web browsers, these two banks don&#x27;t offer any factor like that.In end effect, the banks treat a non-rootable device as suitable as a \"something you have\" factor, but will not treat a rootable device as that. reply user_7832 18 hours agorootparentprevHuh that&#x27;s interesting, thanks for mentioning it. I wasn&#x27;t aware of that. reply fsflover 16 hours agorootparentprevWhich is why I was switching banks until I found one not forcing me into the duopoly. reply OfSanguineFire 16 hours agorootparentIn some countries one no longer has that possibility. Not everywhere has a range of banks to choose from, sometimes mergers have resulted in just a handful of banks for a country, all of which enforce use of an Android app.Oh, it’s fsflover, the poster with the Librem idée fixe. Haven’t noticed you here in couple of years. Your comment elsewhere here about GrapheneOS not requiring much less effort to daily drive is way off. GrapheneOS runs banking apps and, in countries that legally enforce use of certain apps for ID or payment, those apps, too. Zero hoops to jump through. Meanwhile, a Librem phone (or a PinePhone) will not work. reply fsflover 16 hours agorootparentOf course, in some countries you have lack of important freedoms, which says a lot about their state of democracy. However if your country gives you a choice, consider using it in order to not lose it.It&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m somewhat famous. I never suggested that running banking apps on GNU&#x2F;Linux phones was as easy as on Android forks (however, reportedly it is possible for some banks). I meant other daily tasks of course. replyOfSanguineFire 18 hours agorootparentprevOne of the draws of GrapheneOS is that, since Pixel phones have a relockable bootloader, that Android image will pass SafetyNet. While Google Play Services is typically required by banking apps, on GrapheneOS you can run Play Services in its own sandbox. reply seszett 18 hours agorootparentprevIronically you might have to root your phone to install the necessary Magisk modules to make the app think it&#x27;s on a phone running the official thing. reply RetroTechie 19 hours agorootparentprevThey might, but app for my bank works happily on LineageOS.Same eg. with app for a local 2nd hand site, which on startup complains that it needs the Google services... and then runs without issue (only appears to use those Google services to pinpoint the phone&#x27;s location).Imho this is 1 more reason to put alternatives like LineageOS on a phone: the more users on those, the harder it is for app developers to drop that usergroup for... well, reasons. reply SkiFire13 19 hours agorootparentprevMost reject phones that don&#x27;t pass SafetyNet. There are ways to pass it with unofficial images&#x2F;rooted phones, although I&#x27;m not sure for how long they will keep working and I think you still need Google Play. reply BlueTemplar 18 hours agorootparentprevIs that even legal ?Banking and public services are too important to be restricted to people with smartphone ownership (even regardless of OS).It&#x27;s even more important to refuse to use them, publicly shame them, and complain about them failing at their duties. reply lmz 17 hours agorootparentBefore smartphones some banks used a hardware token to authenticate web transactions, but now that is being moved to (non rooted) smartphones. reply tmtvl 14 hours agorootparentI was given a hardware device by my bank to do my online banking. If they want to move to smartphones I expect them to provide me one of those as well. reply OfSanguineFire 13 hours agorootparentOne of the very reasons banks have been phasing out hardware tokens (and code cards) is because they represent a cost. Of course the bank is going to put the price of the smartphone all on customers. reply codedokode 19 hours agorootparentprevDo not use banking apps on a phone because it is not secure (there is no second factor). Use bank&#x27;s website on a laptop instead. reply OfSanguineFire 18 hours agorootparentAs I said, for many banks, in order to log in to the bank&#x27;s website on a laptop, you need to receive a 2FA code sent through the bank’s app on an Android phone. reply mixmastamyk 16 hours agorootparentI’ve found that many times when a service says this the system will work with any OTP program.

If a bank doesn&#x27;t have a website, or a govt app doesn&#x27;t have a website equivalent, then Librem & co is already out of the picture, from the everyday usability standpoint. To provide the citizens freedoms, service providers need to be forced to use open standards, like HTTP & HTML, to serve an standard interface that has all the necessary functionality. No matter how many grassroots initiatives we have, if this is not provided, they are automatically all out of the race.So really, if anything, I&#x27;d like people to focus on regulation. reply jacooper 19 hours agorootparentprevNo it isn&#x27;t, as unlike the others, grapheneOS is actually usable and dailyable. reply fsflover 16 hours agorootparentI doubt grapheneOS requires much less effort to daily drive than others.

In my opinion, Graphene is significantly easier to daily drive because the applications are designed for a phone&#x27;s form factor. reply fsflover 42 minutes agorootparentCould you share which Pinephone apps you needed that aren&#x27;t designed for a phone&#x27;s form factor? replygjsman-1000 20 hours agoparentprev… as long as you trust the developers, and their ability to secure themselves, of course.I mean, if I was a three letter agency, sneaking into some GrapheneOS developer’s basement to add a camera to record his keystrokes would be the easiest trade ever for all the paranoid people using it. It’d be way easier than sneaking into Apple or Google. Might even be worth violating internal law to do it; because getting caught is extremely unlikely, and forgiveness is easy.Edit: Also, don’t forget that, if you should get arrested, “he used GrapheneOS” is 100% going to be used against you in court.

Except for extreme cases, such as a software that is designed to be self destructive on the physical components in which it resides, the hardware should mostly be unaffected by the software. Mostly that some components get used more or less than they were before, changing efficiency of some functions. Then we get into the grey area of whether or not the unorthodox use of components caused damage.> if the manufacturer can show that damage resulted from the user modifying the device then fineHere you are putting the burden of proof on the manufacturer, which seems a little unfair. If anyone can make a complaint (make use of warranty), and you the manufacturer are guilty as charged automatically unless you can prove the software caused the damage, then there will be an insurmountable amount of work to thoroughly review all software not sourced from one of your already-vetted approved sources.Then again, if burden of proof falls on the accuser (warranty holder), it is a catch-22 because you can&#x27;t prove that a software is without any issues. Companies are constantly creating patches not because they intentionally want to have a fault until x day, but because they genuinely thought the software was good until y vulnerability was found&#x2F;exploited.I think this is why companies take the &#x27;any usage outside these specific approved usages voids the warranty&#x27; approach. In application to this conversation, this means while you may change your OS, it doesn&#x27;t shock me that a manufacturer wants to keep their hands away from those consumers reply yjftsjthsd-h 5 hours agorootparentI think it&#x27;s fundamentally more reasonable to demand proof that something did cause a problem, rather than that it didn&#x27;t cause a problem, because you can&#x27;t prove the negative. And yes, of course companies would like to never be liable, but keeping them honest is why we have laws around warranties. reply BHSPitMonkey 13 hours agorootparentprevDo you think the ability for the owner to root is not worthy of protections?

Perhaps it&#x27;s someone who has some sort of play signing enabled with uploading unknown apps and the signature difference between play and fdroid versions might have created a false positive. reply jeroenhd 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s my bet as well, the signature difference probably makes it look like one of the many fake APKs people often download from piracy sites and malware infested file sharing sites.Unfortunately, Google doesn&#x27;t let you upload an APK with your own signature to Google Play anymore, so the devs can&#x27;t really offer any solution. Best I can come up with is downloading the signed version from Google Play and uploading that, but that&#x27;d make updating the app wirhout uninstalling impossible for most of their users. Same with offering the free version as a different package name as the proprietary version, existing users would lose updates.Google needs to fix this because they&#x27;re basically killing every alternative app store this way, which probably violates the DMA&#x2F;DSA law (whichever applies here) in quite a major way. reply jenadine 12 hours agoprevHapenned to me a couple of days ago.

Debloated, in this case, meaning without support for minority languages such as mine. reply boudin 16 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s nothing intentional there. If the keyboard you had installed was also distributed via F-Droid using the same APK identifier, then F-Droid just detects an update since it&#x27;s the same app.To prevent this (it can happen with most apps distributed both on the play store and F-Droid) you can tell F-Droid to ignore updates for a specific app. reply jeroenhd 15 hours agorootparentprevSomeone must&#x27;ve uploaded a version with the same package name.You can open the app on F-Droid and hit the menu button in the top right to ignore updates to the keyboard.You could also file an issue with F-Droid themselves that there&#x27;s a package conflict on there. reply gbil 19 hours agoprev [–] Is this proven?

Or are you saying that we should block ads and refuse to pay? How is that sustainable in the long term? If you&#x27;re against ads, shouldn&#x27;t you support monetization models that don&#x27;t involve ads? reply heavyset_go 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t care if Google is sustainable in the long term or not, just like they don&#x27;t care if they serve me malicious content and malware via their ad networks, or take money, and show me ads, from groups that want people like me dead. reply LtWorf 8 hours agorootparentIn my area they started to put ads to meet hot russian women in youtube.

If a major site offers an ad-free option, and people refuse to take it, what does it tell the executives? What does it tell other publishers who are considering their monetization options? How do you think a business should respond to users that neither refuse to watch ads nor pay, can&#x27;t be bargained with (see above), but nonetheless think they should be entitled to service? Companies aren&#x27;t owed a viable business model, but consumers aren&#x27;t owed a free service either. reply bsaul 10 hours agorootparentthe amount of ads on youtube has grown exponentially and i highly doubt this was because of profitability issues. reply missedthecue 9 hours agorootparentIn a hypothetical world without adblockers, wouldn&#x27;t YouTube need to show a lower amount of ads per person to make the same amount of revenue? reply heavyset_go 9 hours agorootparentNo, look at cable. Companies will turn the dial up on ads as much as they can, consumers have shown that they&#x27;ll tolerate the current level of ads on YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, etc.It&#x27;s no different than price points, not showing the amount of ads the market will bear is leaving money on the table. reply graftak 5 hours agorootparentprevThat trickle down fever dream has been on repeat for ages now but still hasn’t come to fruition. reply Wildliferanger 10 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is higher than zero intrest rates the free money dried up where before all the platforms were chasing infinte growth and free money meant they could run deficts as long as they grew they now need to make a profit now that debt costs money plus investor cash got sucked away to Bonds, CDs, and money market accounts giving a safe 5-7%.

Simple solution. reply mvdtnz 10 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re just rationalising.

Overall i agree with you, but lets not pretend that Youtube doesn&#x27;t feel exploitative in the corporate behavior here. Especially considering the data they&#x27;re stealing from me, harvesting and selling, etc.Ie show me the ads i&#x27;m missing, and let me pay for the view. It would be what, $3|5|7&#x2F;m or w&#x2F;e in value? Instead they&#x27;re trying to strongarm you into an upcharge of $14&#x2F;m for additional services. Show me the data they&#x27;re harvesting from my viewing patterns and the added revenue they&#x27;re getting from that. Tie that into my \"cost\" each month and reducing how much i owe.But of course they won&#x27;t do that. Because this isn&#x27;t an exchange. This isn&#x27;t a service we&#x27;re paying for, it&#x27;s a data harvest where they want to have their cake and eat it too. This is scummy in the same way that my music software, Spotify, is trying to expand revenue streams and shoving more crap (podcasts, audio books, etc) down my throat.If Youtube isn&#x27;t going to try and play fair then i&#x27;d rather leave (and will) than pay them. reply gruez 10 hours agorootparent>I think it&#x27;s somewhat defendable when youtube doesn&#x27;t give you an option to pay for what you&#x27;d be \"stealing\".https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;premium reply kemayo 8 hours agorootparentNot the person you&#x27;re responding to, but from how they phrased it I suspect they&#x27;d be annoyed that they&#x27;re having to pay for YouTube Music as part of Premium. reply throw_nbvc1234 8 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not just paying Youtube&#x2F;Google for the ad, you&#x27;re paying the content creators as well. You can always buy the music directly from artists if you don&#x27;t like Spotify&#x27;s revenue model. Or ditch Spotify and use the free Youtube Music subscription you get with premium, maybe combined it&#x27;d be worth the $14 to you. reply rerdavies 6 hours agorootparentYoutube music is actually pretty remarkable. I&#x27;m a jazz musician. One of the remarkable features of YouTube is that if you&#x27;re looking for a particular recording of a jazz tune (e.g. Lou Donaldson&#x27;s The Masquerade Is Over, on the Blues Walk album, 1953), it&#x27;s just there. The depth of the collection is quite amazing.And as an added bonus, if you subscribe you get no ads on youtube! :-P reply graftak 5 hours agorootparentIf YT music is so great they could make it optional instead of making me pay for a second music streaming service that I don’t want or need.I hope they get a big fat EU fine for (illegal here) joint sales. reply xuhu 9 hours agorootparentprevIt sure is.

Na-ah. reply Spivak 10 hours agorootparentprevSure it is, you&#x27;re not even involved in the transaction. Just because someone pays Google to show an ad doesn&#x27;t mean you have to look at it. USPS is funded by ads going through the mail and I throw them straight in the trash without remorse. I bet you do too. Bet you don&#x27;t feel guilt about going to the bathroom or fast-forwarding your DVR during commercials either. Ad space is sold on the possibility that someone will see it and you don&#x27;t owe anyone valuable ad real-estate.It&#x27;s wild how many people unironically think \"drink verification can\" is in any way acceptable. reply gruez 10 hours agorootparent> Just because someone pays Google to show an ad doesn&#x27;t mean you have to look at itJust because someone has an internet connection doesn&#x27;t mean google has to serve them videos, either. reply frumper 4 hours agorootparentI’m confused.

You&#x27;ll notice that nowhere are people saying \"Google should have to give you a switch to turn off ads for free.\"You act like that&#x27;s a gotcha when \"I owe you nothing, you owe me nothing\" is the state I&#x27;m arguing for. reply rerdavies 6 hours agorootparentprevI can&#x27;t actually remember the last time I got mail-mail. reply mvdtnz 9 hours agorootparentprevAt no point did I suggest people should be forced to view ads. reply mfru 4 hours agorootparentprevi love paying for nebula and support my favorite creators there and blocking everything else on youtube reply hkt 10 hours agorootparentprevMaybe we don&#x27;t want the business models of data hoarding multibillion dollar corporations to be sustainable. Maybe there are good alternatives that don&#x27;t rely so much on exploitative practices. Just a thought. reply acdha 9 hours agorootparentThose are great reasons not to use YouTube.

If they are so evil why even use YouTube at all. reply eastbound 10 hours agorootparentBecause we’re addicted?I’m serious, but philosophically, the onus is clearly on us to get rid of our addiction. But Youtube is a quasi-monopoly of random micro-conferences. Nebula and Vimeo aren’t on the same market. So basically we specifically like Youtube. But I’d never pay Google after what they did to James Damore. reply bboygravity 10 hours agorootparentprevBittorrent would like to have a word. reply mindslight 8 hours agorootparentprevThen why did Youtube&#x2F;Google start hosting videos for free? And continue to do so for so long, if it was \"unsustainable\" ? That was the deal they offered, and that people bought into. Now that they&#x27;ve achieved the soft lock in of network effects, we should accept them completely altering those terms? In the antitrust sense, this is called dumping. reply paulcole 10 hours agorootparentprevAvoiding using services whose business practices you disagree with feels like a bigger moral obligation but what do I know? reply graftak 4 hours agorootparentThat would be a fine argument of Google did not own the long-form general topic diy online video space. Since they do and there are no alternatives they can suck it until they (if ever) improve their business practices. reply acdha 10 hours agorootparentprevStealing is never a moral obligation. The only moral choices are not using YouTube or paying for it - and if you truly believe YouTube abuses users, you definitely shouldn’t be encouraging more people to use it, which your presence does by telling creators they get more traffic there. reply basilgohar 10 hours agorootparentPaying for your own Internet, accessing something publicly accessible, and downloading your preferred subset of bits of what&#x27;s available on your own hardware is not stealing.Compelling my own property to behave against my wishes is the moral failing. reply acdha 9 hours agorootparentYouTube is not publicly accessible: they offer it under specific terms, namely that you watch ads or pay directly. If you don’t want to accept that deal you don’t have any more right to use their private property than you do to complain that the local movie theater wouldn’t let you sneak in when you didn’t like their ticket prices. reply travoc 9 hours agorootparentYouTube has no problem serving content to my yt-dlp client without ads, payment, authentication or terms of service. reply acdha 9 hours agorootparentThat doesn’t mean it’s allowed, only that they haven’t blocked it again.

I pay for premium, but people who don&#x27;t and still block ads are not wrong. reply acdha 10 hours agorootparentYouTube offers their service under specific terms: watch ads or pay directly. If you don’t like it, your only ethical option is not using it. It’s not a basic need and anyone can live a happy and full life without it, there’s no need to pretend that not keeping your side of the agreement is somehow just if you squint hard enough. reply Brian_K_White 8 hours agorootparentYoutube offers a service to advertisers. The users are both the content providers as well as the content consumers, which cancels out. Youtube sells something which is essentially parasitical on the uploaders, who actually create the value that they get to sell to advertisers, but you can say symbiotic instead of parasitic as long as the uploading and downloading are free.The mail example is great. The post office has no right to withhold your other mail between someone else and yourself, because you threw away the ad flyer someone paid them to deliver.Meanwhile, I pay for premium and still have to suffer ads, because every video has ads in-band in the content, and I have to watch youtube on someone else&#x27;s device probably 30% of the time, and have my content (what I would consume not produce) censored and inhibited by bs ai \"community standards\" and dmca takedowns I didn&#x27;t approve of, and even without ever looking at an ad, they are collecting and selling profiling data of me which I also don&#x27;t approve of. So where&#x27;s my option to strong-arm youtube to force them to fully meet my \"terms\" and get what I&#x27;m paying for? How come it&#x27;s not reasonable for me to somehow make it that if they don&#x27;t please ME, that their own server side somehow breeaks unless they conform to what decide is a reasonable fair transaction?None of this \"terms\" argument holds up. All they have is might, not right. reply paulryanrogers 9 hours agorootparentprevWhat is YouTube stealing? reply Brian_K_White 9 hours agorootparentLots of things in different ways, but for one example, ad & premium money from videos that they demonetize.Not to mention literally stealing original content and granting it to anyone else who simply claims copyright without proving it or being able to prove it since it&#x27;s not theirs.Then there are all kinds of indirect ways as a consequence of their various policies and how they implement and enforce them, like showing me ads after taking my premium money, or collecting and selling the profiling data of my watch&#x2F;like&#x2F;dislike data, etc. replyhuytersd 9 hours agorootparentprevIt costs too much. I wish they would unbundle it from that music service. reply russh 8 hours agorootparentExactly, I used to subscribe to premium but it’s not worth the price just to avoid ads and I have no use for the rest of the stuff they bundle into premium to justify the price. reply kristofferR 9 hours agorootparentprevYoutube Premium is a waste of money, they bundle a crappy $11&#x2F;m music service with it, for $13&#x2F;m. It&#x27;s worse than having to pay for cable or landline telephone to get internet.I&#x27;d pay $2&#x2F;m, or even $4 bucks, for ad-free Youtube, but I&#x27;m not buying an additional music service I don&#x27;t want or need. reply melevittfl 4 hours agorootparentYup, this is exactly why I don’t subscribe. I already pay for Spotify so I don’t need another music service.I’d happily pay for just no ads. reply momirlan 10 hours agorootparentprevthis comment never fails to appear on any Youtube blocker thread.

In the all-stick no-carrot spirit of modern marketing incentives, they made their unpaid access worse without improving Premium. That only works if the garden has walls, and logging in to youtube is optional. Now youtube use falls into three options:1) Don&#x27;t log in to google, block ads. Data collected by google is lower value, resulting in less targeted internet-wide marketing, including on youtube itself when you clear your browsing session.2) Log in. Lose time to ads. Trying to avoid this may put your entire google account at risk. Also, you gain highly targeted marketing thanks to higher quality data collection. Youtube&#x27;s viewing suggestions are targeted, limiting discovery, and may become highly pigeonholed over time.3) Pay for Premium. All the same as 2) but with less ads.As a consumer, logging out of google and blocking youtube ads has been made by google a better experience than their own premium product. Only the producers of the majority of youtube&#x27;s product are required to consume what google is doing. reply ajsnigrutin 8 hours agorootparentThis is only true, until they stop video playback for not-logged-in users.Twitter is pretty much useless unless you have an account, can&#x27;t even see replies anymore. reply snapplebobapple 11 hours agorootparentprevThis is what i did when i got the \"we are going to start blocking playback ....\" Message and it worked great.

Any client-side solution will be an arms race between Google and user script&#x2F;adblock devs. The only real way to prevent it is to withhold the video stream from the CDN until the client has streamed the full ad and&#x2F;or bake it into the video stream. My impression is that Twitch does this for its live streams (although not VODs). reply serf 11 hours agorootparentyeah.given that in-stream ads still have blocking&#x2F;ignoring methods I think that if this arms race keeps going that ultimately the data (video, whatever) is going to be stuffed behind some hard authentication barrier of some sort -- and then traditional piracy methods will take over like single-user-rebroadcast&#x2F;etc. reply Aurornis 10 hours agorootparentThe number of people who will do all the things necessary to play in that arms race gets smaller and smaller with each extra difficulty.In the end, if the only way to block the ads is to have a setup so complicated that only 1 in 10,000 people would be able and willing to maintain it, that’s basically perfect. The people who will spend hours and hours perfecting and maintaining their ad blocking setup were never going to buy premium anyway and they’re negligible drains on resources. reply losteric 11 hours agorootparentprevI look forward to my browser-based TiVo, buffering videos to ship over ads just like in the 00s...

Permalinks, since they’re necessary would just redirects (to a temporal URL).A temporal URL here uses different random looking values for the each user rather than a fixed one (like a URL shorter), and encode a validity window (not before&#x2F;after).The core idea here being that the code in the app doesn’t know the difference between ads and user content, which would make it very difficult for any intermediary to do so. And, if if they did the URL for the “real” content wouldn’t work until the time to play the ad had passed - so what’d be the point in bothering?Like others have said - ya just have to pay for the things you value. No shame in being thrifty, but as I learned from my first employer: pick great suppliers and never force them out of business. reply brucethemoose2 7 hours agorootparentprevSplicing ads into a video is almost instant, but its a technical change as mentioned above. reply josephcsible 7 hours agorootparentprev> Another option is to require Chrome for playback outside of authenticated apps, and lock Chrome down.I really hope that that would be enough to finally coax the antitrust regulators into doing something. reply paulmd 10 hours agorootparentprev> This, in turn, will spawn user scripts which work around the detection. Any client-side solution will be an arms race between Google and user script&#x2F;adblock devsNo, you can&#x27;t adblock remote attestation. Trust me, the whole idea is cryptographically sound (with a proper implementation of course), people have been building out the remote attestation&#x2F;TPM space for 20 years now. It is unambiguously possible to use a TPM to detect modification of BIOS, OS, drivers, or anything else in the system, and you effectively cannot modify the TPM at all, and it has minimal attack surface (it just is a key-signing machine, essentially).random practical explanation from someone&#x27;s college papers: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;seclab.stanford.edu&#x2F;pcl&#x2F;cs259&#x2F;projects&#x2F;cs259_final_l...Every time it&#x27;s brought up (like I previously suggested that it could be used by NVIDIA&#x2F;etc to disrupt mining operations from a VBIOS level) there&#x27;s people who think there is some easy runaround and if there was the whole idea would be broken from the start. The TPM provides a secure root to start the cryptographic validation from, and while you can mod the software, it will be immediately evident from the attestation, and they will simply not serve the video. Or in the case of a GPU, you can have the PC attest to the drivers being official and unmodified, and if that doesn&#x27;t happen the GPU refuses to clock up the memory bus, if the workload displays the characteristics of mining (100% memory load, flat and constant and low shader load).At best it will be an arms race between TPM developers and adblock devs.There is also the \"analog gap\", but that&#x27;s been notionally plugged for years using HDCP. Early implementations were quickly broken, HDCP 2.3 is still doing pretty well, and it provides a massive speedbump to people who think they&#x27;re just going to plug a capture card in and loop the video through.Netflix and others have been doing this for years and the tricks are well-known at this point. Netflix doesn&#x27;t push too hard, but they won&#x27;t serve you the highest-quality video if you don&#x27;t have a secure signal path either.AFAIK at this point most of the \"ripping\" of decryption keys&#x2F;etc for streaming content happens not by attacking the TPM, but by using android devices that are allowed to skate with reduced security modes, and just having a giant stack of them so when one device gets banned they throw it away and move onto the next. reply gruez 10 hours agorootparent>AFAIK at this point most of the \"ripping\" of decryption keys&#x2F;etc for streaming content happens not by attacking the TPM, but by using android devices that are allowed to skate with reduced security modes, and just having a giant stack of them so when one device gets banned they throw it away and move onto the next.Without a TEE (eg. trustzone), you&#x27;re not going to get anything above 540p, at least with widevine.

Although the Kalman Filter is a straightforward concept, many resources on the subject require extensive mathematical background and fail to provide practical examples and illustrations, making it more complicated than necessary. Back in 2017, I created an online tutorial based on numerical examples and intuitive explanations to make the topic more accessible and understandable. The online tutorial provides introductory material covering the univariate (one-dimensional) and multivariate (multidimensional) Kalman Filters. Over time, I have received many requests to include more advanced topics, such as non-linear Kalman Filters (Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter), sensors fusion, and practical implementation guidelines. Based on the material covered in the online tutorial, I authored a book. The original online tutorial is available for free access. The e-book and the source code (Python and MATLAB) for the numerical examples are available for purchase at a special introductory price. The book takes the reader from the basics to the advanced topics, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. The writing style is intuitive, prioritizing clarity of ideas over mathematical rigor, and it approaches the topic from a philosophical perspective before delving into quantification. The book contains many illustrative examples, including 14 fully solved numerical examples with performance plots and tables. Examples progress in a paced, logical manner and build upon each other. The book also includes the necessary mathematical background, providing a solid foundation to expand your knowledge and help to overcome your math fears. Upon finishing this book, you will be able to design, simulate, and evaluate the performance of the Kalman Filter. The book includes four parts: Part 1 serves as an introduction to the Kalman Filter, using eight numerical examples, and doesn't require any prior mathematical knowledge. You can call it \"The Kalman Filter for Dummies,\" as it aims to provide an intuitive understanding and develop \"Kalman Filter intuition.\" Upon completing Part 1, readers will thoroughly understand the Kalman Filter's concept and be able to design a univariate (one-dimensional) Kalman Filter. Most of this part is available for free access! Part 2 presents the Kalman Filter in matrix notation, covering the multivariate (multidimensional) Kalman Filter. It includes a mathematical derivation of Kalman Filter equations, dynamic systems modeling, and two numerical examples. This section is more advanced and requires basic knowledge of Linear Algebra (only matrix operations). Upon completion, readers will understand the math behind the Kalman Filter and be able to design a multivariate Kalman Filter. Most of this part is available for free access! Part 3 is dedicated to the non-linear Kalman Filter, which is essential for mastering the Kalman Filter since most real-life systems are non-linear. This part begins with a problem statement and describes the differences between linear and non-linear systems. It includes derivation and examples of the most common non-linear filters: the Extended Kalman Filter and the Unscented Kalman Filter. Part 4 contains practical guidelines for Kalman Filter implementation, including sensor fusion, variable measurement uncertainty, treatment of missing measurements, treatment of outliers, and the Kalman Filter design process.

I am an engineer with over 20 years of experience in the wireless technologies field. As a part of my work, I had to deal with Kalman Filters, mainly for tracking applications. Constructive criticism is always welcome. I would greatly appreciate your comments and suggestions. Please drop me an email. The numerical examples in this tutorial do not exemplify any modes, methodologies, techniques, or parameters employed by any operational system known to the author. ABOUT THE KALMAN FILTER Many modern systems utilize multiple sensors to estimate hidden (unknown) states through a series of measurements. For instance, a GPS receiver can estimate location and velocity, where location and velocity represent the hidden states, while the differential time of the arrival of signals from satellites serves as measurements. One of the biggest challenges of tracking and control systems is providing an accurate and precise estimation of the hidden states in the presence of uncertainty. For example, GPS receivers are subject to measurement uncertainties influenced by external factors, such as thermal noise, atmospheric effects, slight changes in satellite positions, receiver clock precision, and more. The Kalman Filter is a widely used estimation algorithm that plays a critical role in many fields. It is designed to estimate the hidden states of the system, even when the measurements are imprecise and uncertain. Also, the Kalman Filter predicts the future system state based on past estimations. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán (May 19, 1930 – July 2, 2016). In 1960, Kálmán published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. THE PREDICTION REQUIREMENT Before delving into the Kalman Filter explanation, let us first understand the necessity of a tracking and prediction algorithm. To illustrate this point, let's take the example of a tracking radar. Suppose we have a track cycle of 5 seconds. At intervals of 5 seconds, the radar samples the target by directing a dedicated pencil beam. Once the radar \"visits\" the target, it proceeds to estimate the current position and velocity of the target. The radar also estimates (or predicts) the target's position at the time of the next track beam. The future target position can be easily calculated using Newton's motion equations: x= x 0 + v 0 Δt+ 1 2 aΔ t 2 𝑥 = 𝑥 0 + 𝑣 0 Δ 𝑡 + 1 2 𝑎 Δ 𝑡 2 Where: x 𝑥is the target position x 0 𝑥 0is the initial target position v 0 𝑣 0is the initial target velocity a 𝑎is the target acceleration Δt Δ 𝑡is the time interval (5 seconds in our example) If you need a refresh on the motion equations, refer to Appendix I in the book. When dealing with three dimensions, Newton's motion equations can be expressed as a system of equations: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ x= x 0 + v x0 Δt+ 1 2 a x Δ t 2 y= y 0 + v y0 Δt+ 1 2 a y Δ t 2 z= z 0 + v z0 Δt+ 1 2 a z Δ t 2 { 𝑥 = 𝑥 0 + 𝑣 𝑥 0 Δ 𝑡 + 1 2 𝑎 𝑥 Δ 𝑡 2 𝑦 = 𝑦 0 + 𝑣 𝑦 0 Δ 𝑡 + 1 2 𝑎 𝑦 Δ 𝑡 2 𝑧 = 𝑧 0 + 𝑣 𝑧 0 Δ 𝑡 + 1 2 𝑎 𝑧 Δ 𝑡 2 The set of target parameters [x,y,z, v x , v y , v z , a x , a y , a z ] [ 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧 , 𝑣 𝑥 , 𝑣 𝑦 , 𝑣 𝑧 , 𝑎 𝑥 , 𝑎 𝑦 , 𝑎 𝑧 ] is known as the System State. The current state serves as the input for the prediction algorithm, while the algorithm's output is the future state, which includes the target parameters for the subsequent time interval. The system of equations mentioned above is known as a Dynamic Model or State Space Model. The dynamic model describes the relationship between the input and output of the system. Apparently, if the target's current state and dynamic model are known, predicting the target's subsequent state can be easily accomplished. In reality, the radar measurement is not entirely accurate. It contains random errors or uncertainties that can affect the accuracy of the predicted target state. The magnitude of the errors depends on various factors, such as radar calibration, beam width, and signal-to-noise ratio of the returned echo. The random errors or uncertainties in the radar measurement are known as Measurement Noise. In addition, the target motion is not always aligned with the motion equations due to external factors like wind, air turbulence, and pilot maneuvers. This misalignment between the motion equations and the actual target motion results in an error or uncertainty in the dynamic model, which is called Process Noise. Due to the Measurement Noise and the Process Noise, the estimated target position can be far away from the actual target position. In this case, the radar might send the track beam in the wrong direction and miss the target. In order to improve the radar's tracking accuracy, it is essential to employ a prediction algorithm that accounts for both process and measurement uncertainty. The most common tracking and prediction algorithm is the Kalman Filter. Get the book Next © Copyright 2023, Alex Becker",

Like \"finally, I get to take an evening to understand this concept that&#x27;s eluded me for years.\" Generally, I get let down. This time is no exception.They always start off well, then inevitably there&#x27;s a concept or key terminology that gets glossed over without sufficient explanation. .\"The random variable is described by the probability density function. The probability density function is characterized by moments.The moments of the random value are expected values of powers of the random variable. We are interested in two types of moments\"This is where my journey ended this time. OK, so is that the expected value of the expontnent.of the random value orthe expected value of the random value to some power... and what makes the power of a randome value so special vice just operating on the randome value itself.It&#x27;s like these authors get tired of \"dumbing\" things down at random points in their chain of thought and just decide to skip over stuff. Or, perhaps they don&#x27;t understand the underlying concepts themselves and simply can&#x27;t explain them to others.Who knows. Just frustrating. At least in Udemy you can write to instructors and ask questions. Unlike a book author who aren&#x27;t paid to respond. reply travisjungroth 9 hours agoparentOne of the biggest challenges in learning, especially in learning something new, is that it’s a chain. If you don’t have something’s prerequisite knowledge, you can’t understand it (by definition). This means that only one insufficient explanation by the author blows it. As a general rule, it’s really hard to not mess up once!You make a good distinction between someone being paid to respond and not. A feedback loop helps out a lot here.Failing that, you need to take this into your own hands. Honestly, you’re probably going to have to tell yourself a new story to get there. Maybe having empathy for the difficulty of teaching. Maybe it’s finding some inner drive. I don’t know. But you need to look at that paragraph, accept it’s insufficiently explained, and take responsibility for understanding it.I’m not saying to read it over and over until you “get it”. (I don’t know why people try that, it’s kinda foolish). A simple strategy works most of the time. Read it until you find a word or phrase you don’t sufficiently understand. Maybe that’s “random variable”. Maybe it’s “probability density function”. Find an explanation for that (Wikipedia, ChatGPT, textbooks, videos). The fun thing is this algorithm is recursive. So you’ll likely run into something you don’t know again. That’s okay, just keep going. If it’s really tough, a lot of the value of a tutor is steering this depth first search.Get each concept to the point you understand it very well for the problem at hand. You don’t have to know everything about PDFs, but don’t hand wave it either. After this process, you’ll be able understand this paragraph and continue.This may take a while! If something is in a new domain, it’s usual for you to actually spend more time backfilling knowledge than on the main content itself. That may make it not worth it for you, but it’s not inherently bad. And the next time for something similar should be faster. reply syntaxfree 8 hours agorootparentThe pdf is just the pullback measure.A random variable is a function X(w) taking (eg) real values. In your probability space you already have an ambient measure space and an ambient probability measure P which takes sets in the measure space to [0,1]. The pdf is then the function defined on sets P(invX(q)). invX is a set valued inverse.Ok, consider coin flips. Then X takes each element of sample space either to 1 or -1. Set values inverse of 1 is the sets that map to 1. Then we get the ambient probability measure of them.You don’t really have to cope with measure theory in full to take this tiny step. reply travisjungroth 5 hours agorootparentI don’t think the set of people who couldn’t understand the quoted paragraph but could understand your comment is very large. reply mojomark 9 hours agoparentprevIf anyone was frustrated like me on this concept of \"moments\" I found the following insightful and fascinating:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gregorygundersen.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;moments&#x2F;I have no idea how I got through undergrad and graduate school without internalizing this concept that seems so foundational.

I’ve always thought this would be a good way to teach them, because you can start with a simplified univariate case, then modify and generalize from there. reply dkarras 9 hours agoparentprevI feel this frustration in my bones, and I felt the same way up until the proliferation of LLMs. Just paste your comment to Claude (or ChatGPT maybe?) and it will explain everything you want to know in realtime. reply bigbillheck 9 hours agorootparentSure, if you don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s actually correct or not. reply bootsmann 3 hours agorootparentThere are so many explanations of moments in the training set, it should be correct. reply mojomark 9 hours agorootparentprevHa, no joke. I definitely find myself doing that more and more. Good reminder. reply howenterprisey 8 hours agoparentprevYep. When I write tutorials I try very, very hard to avoid having a single moment like this. Takes more effort, but I find that it makes for a better explanation. reply bigbillheck 9 hours agoparentprev> and what makes the power of a randome value so special vice just operating on the randome value itself.Literally four sentences later you would have found: * The first raw moment E(X) – the mean of the sequence of measurements. * The second central moment E((X−μX)2) – the variance of the sequence of measurements.And if you had gotten as far as the part you quoted, you would have seen an extended example of why one is interested in means and variances. reply mojomark 7 hours agorootparentI of course read that next section, and beyond, but respectfully disagree that the expressions provided don&#x27;t justify further explanation. For example, the author neglects to define &#x27;X&#x27; as the set of support values for some probability distribution. That&#x27;s left to the reader to figure out for some reason. Further, nowhere is &#x27;E(X)&#x27; defined as the integral of x*f(x) dx, or that the exponent &#x27;k&#x27; only applies to the first &#x27;x&#x27; term in that expression (i.e. if k=3, then E(X^3) = integral of (x^3)f(x) dx. How is the reader supposed to know all that?That was left up to me to hunt down... which is fine I guess, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say this is \"from the ground up\". At the very least, link to some external content that provides the necessary definitions. reply hanche 13 hours agoprevI attended a short series of lectures by Kalman years ago. As I recall it, he very strongly emphasised the virtue of working directly with observed data, avoiding the biases resulting from positing a model and trying to adapt it to the data. He was quite insistent on this point, citing Newton’s _Principia_ as a good example of this principle at work: Newton, he said, did not cast around for models that might explain Kepler’s laws. Instead, he _derived_ the inverse square law of gravitation from Kepler’s laws, largely using geometric arguments. He was an excellent speaker, and highly opinionated. And of course he did explain the idea behind the Kalman filter. However, since I never needed them myself in my work, I have long since forgotten the details. reply p5a0u9l 12 hours agoparentThat’s a cool story. I feel like this is so overlooked. I’ve worked with scientists and engineers who’ve actually deployed systems that are incredibly complicated and pretty well known. Those folks are usually skeptical of trendy algorithms and usually start with first principles. 90% of the time, a boring old linear Kalman with simple (or no) motion model will do the trick. reply tnecniv 11 hours agorootparentNo motion model? If your model doesn’t have dynamics, it’s not really doing Kalman filtering reply chubs 12 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been asked by a friend recently to implement a Kalman filter for a side project. Among many others, I&#x27;ve read this website and still have no idea how to implement it. They all seem to be in the style of &#x27;draw the rest of the owl&#x27;.Can anyone point to anything that explains it in a manner a programmer would explain (eg array iteration instead of sigma notation) ?As far as i understand, Kalman Filters seem to be a moving average of position, velocity, and (perhaps) acceleration, and use those 3 values to estimate the &#x27;real value&#x27; as opposed to what the sensor is telling you. reply tnecniv 11 hours agoparentAs far as resources, I’m not sure. It really only takes a few lines of code if you have a linear algebra library like NumPy or similar. However you need to write down the math describing your dynamics first.The Kalman filter is really just Bayes Theorem applied to a particular set of system dynamics. Really it’s two applications of Bayes rule: given my current state estimate, how do I update my estimate when I receive a measurement? Then, after receiving that measurement, how will the system dynamics impact my uncertainty before the next measurement? You iterate applying these two every time you receive a measurement.Do you have a dynamics model? I.e., a set of equations that tell you how what ever you are trying to track will update in time? That’s the first thing you need and if you don’t have that, I could see you being quite confused about the implementation.It might help you to either read about particle filters or just Bayes filters generally. The Kalman filter is a Bayes filter for a specific set of assumptions that leads to a lot of linear algebra. If you understand the Bayes filter, the Kalman filter will make more sense, and you can learn about the Bayes filter without all the matrices. The particle filter is another algorithm worth reading about. Like the Kalman filter, it is a Bayes filter but it doesn’t require the linear algebra.Aside: I always get frustrated when I see people saying that you don’t need to know math to be a software developer. Maybe that’s true if you want to make web pages, but the more math you know, the better your ability to model problems and either solve them yourself or find solutions others have created. The scope of problems you can solve via programming becomes so much bigger the more math you know. reply dilyevsky 11 hours agoparentprev> As far as i understand, Kalman Filters seem to be a moving average of position, velocity, and (perhaps) acceleration, and use those 3 values to estimate the &#x27;real value&#x27; as opposed to what the sensor is telling you.Sort of. The actual variables (v, r, a in your case) vary depending on your use case. What matters is you make an estimate based on that state, then you take a measurement and there’s an iterative way of adjusting your next state based on those two. It’s actually pretty easy to code once you understand formulas.Maybe this could help http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bilgin.esme.org&#x2F;BitsAndBytes&#x2F;KalmanFilterforDummies reply chubs 8 hours agorootparentThanks for the link! That&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve read so far :) reply sampo 7 hours agoparentprev> They all seem to be in the style of &#x27;draw the rest of the owl&#x27;.You need a linear discrete-time dynamical system model of your process. With the possible additions of external control action, and process noise. Your dynamical system has an internal state, described as a vector of values. Then you also need a linear model, of how the internal state translates to your observations, plus observation noise.x – model state F – linear state transition model: x(t+1) = F x(t) Q – covariance matrix for process noise, so actually x(t+1) = F x(t) + N(0,Q) H – linear observation model R – covariance matrix for observation noise u, B – external control vector u, and B for how u acts on the model state. Optional.N(0,Q) is a normal distribution with 0 mean and covariance Q.For example, in the case of a moving physical object, the model state is [ x ] [ v ]where x is location and v is velocity. (Earlier I used x for the entire model state. Here I use x just for the location.) Then with radar or whatever, you usually only observe the location, and current velocity is unobservable. So your observation model is [ 1 0 ] [ 0 0 ]so that [ 1 0 ] [ x ] = [ x ] [ 0 0 ] [ v ] [ 0 ].This is the owl you need to have, before doing anything with a Kalman filter. You really need to come up with these things on your own, based on what kind of a process you have.Then Kalman filter tells you, how to best estimate the real state vector at each time step, when both your state transition model, and your observation contains noise.You are correct, many Kalman filter tutorials are a mess, where the explanation of the parts of the chosen process model, and parts of the Kalman filter, are blended together and the reader has a hard time telling them apart. And quite often they start with the simplest possible example, where the model state is 1-dimensional, i.e. just one number. And where the process model is a constant (no change): x(t+1) = x(t). So F = 1. This can lead even further confusion, what is the dynamical model and what are the parts of the Kalman filter, when the model is so small that it sort of disappears in the equations. reply mecsred 11 hours agoparentprevI can recommend a textbook called Probabilistic Robotics by Dieter Fox, Sebastian Thrun, and Wolfram Burgard. There&#x27;s good coverage of Kalman and information filters in the first few chapters. reply TFortunato 11 hours agoparentprevHoping I can help you grok the problem a bit more. Typing on phone, so please excuse the lack of decent formatting.A moving average is a good place to start thinking about it. Think about a case where you would use a moving average, and why. You are probably using it because you have some measurement (sensor) that you know is noisy, and so by averaging out the noise (taking the mean of a number of samples) you try to get a better estimate of the true value. If you know how noisy the sensor is, you can get an idea of how many samples you should average over to get a good measurement. You can also take the standard deviation and report both the mean and variance of your measurement over multiple samples if you wanted.For purposes of this example moving forward -- we are going to estimate all of our sensed or inferred values as a gaussian, parameterized by mean and variance. It&#x27;s a simple way to give a measurement with some uncertainty around it.This can be a good start if you know nothing little about the system you are measuring, other then the sensor &#x2F; measurement is noisy. However for many systems you may have multiple quantities you are interested in estimating, and you have some idea of how they relate to each other.Take your example of a physical system with acceleration, velocity and position. Basic physics will tell you that if at time t, you are at position p, moving at velocity v, then at time t+dt, your position should be roughly p+(v*dt). Similarly, you can update your velocity estimate using your estimate of acceleration. If this is a system under your control, then you can also take things like a force you commanded to update your acceleration model. This is great, by using physics, without any measuring after time 0, we can just figure everything out forward in time forever, by simply using our process model! However, because your initial estimates had some uncertainty, what you will find is that, if you just keep doing this, the uncertainty grows larger and larger with each time step, and eventually become so large as to be useless.Enter tha kalman filter. What the kalman filter does is tries to combine the information given by your sensors and combine it with your process model to give you a better estimate of the quantities you are interested in than you could get from either technique alone.Every time step the filter will make an state estimate using the process model based on your previous state estimate, and then use your current sensor measurements to update that state estimate, both in terms of the mean and uncertainty. In the basic kalman filter you assume your process model is linear, all of your estimates are simple gaussians, and then decide how much you want to weigh your model vs. your sensors via a simple multiplying factor, \"the kalman gain\"Sorry again I couldn&#x27;t write this out as a program, and the likely horrible run-on sentences that come from typing on a phone, but I hope that a quick overview of what the technique is trying to do will help make it a little easier to fill in the owl! reply chubs 7 hours agorootparentThanks a lot!

Gaussian filters can’t do that and just result in blurry blobs that cover several blocks. reply Scipio_Afri 7 hours agoparentDo you have any recommended resources for learning about particle filters?Also l, what other types of newer models or more advanced models other than the particle filter would you recommend for offline processing? reply jiggawatts 1 hour agorootparentUnfortunately I don&#x27;t have anything at hand better than what Google would provide. reply alexpotato 14 hours agoprevAlmost every explainer I have ever seen on Kalman filters starts with something like this:\"Let&#x27;s begin with an intuitive example: think of a thermostat as it adjusts to the temperature.

This estimate often has some lag in it, likely because you have some incomplete information that you couldn&#x27;t model. Sometimes we care about the previous states (e.g., x_k-1). But if we just save these states and refer to them, we&#x27;re not getting the most out of our data.The Kalman Smoother can be used to go back and update these past values with all the samples up to the current time. To update your previous measurements, you need to save the state of your filter at every timestep (x_k) and its associated covariance matrix (P_k). You can then apply Kalman Smoothing to reprocess previous data and update it with all current information. This will often remove the phase delay that you would otherwise observe in your estimate. reply bp0017 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is my question as well, I&#x27;ve read multiple sources that imply the Kalman smoother would work for my problem, but not exactly _how_ in a way that I could make sense of programmatically. reply javitury 19 hours agoprevThere is no explanation about how Kalman filters work in the article, it is just an advertisement for a book.

The Kalman filter is exactly Bayes theorem for linear dynamics and additive Gaussian noise. Bayes theorem is more general, but these assumptions yield a simple set of linear equations that can be solved very quickly.In general, using Bayes theorem for filtering is often called the Bayes filter. Outside of a limited set of circumstances, it is not possible to implement. The Kalman filter is one set of circumstances because linear transforms of Gaussian distributions remain Gaussian, and we can specify a Gaussian process just by its mean and covariance. Another set of circumstances is when you have a discrete system with a small enough number of states.In general however, the Bayes filter results in an infinite dimensional dynamical system since it yields a typically continuous function representing the distribution of your state given your measurements. The Kalman filter, particle filter, and other methods approximate this problem via a more tractable finite dimensional representation. reply victor106 18 hours agoprev> The Kalman Filter algorithm is a powerful tool for estimating and predicting system states in the presence of uncertainty...How is this different than any of the ML models? reply vonwoodson 17 hours agoparentKalman Filters were developed outside the context of “Machine Learning” and found practical applications much earlier. If you define ML as an algorithm that is “trained by input data”, than any statistical model would be ML. So is the ambiguity around the terms ML and AI in general.Where a KF is really going to kick the pants of a multi-layer perception&#x2F;neural network is how computationally efficient it is. A KF only takes a couple of matrices of size N^2, where N is the number of variables you’re trying to predict. Compare this to a NN with hundreds&#x2F;thousands of nodes. Also, the KF is “online learning” in that it “is trained as you go” rather than some other ML models that require upfront training, a KF is very useful for live update-and-predict use cases. And, again, it’s extremely computationally efficient, and can run easily on embedded systems. The book ad, here, suggests tracking: so tracking an airplane with an air traffic control radar would be an effective use for a KF. (Where NNets have found any other uses I’m sure you’re aware of.)Another huge benefit of a KF is that, unlike NNets, KFs are “explainable”, and in fact extremely well understood by many professionals. This means that a KF can be better tuned to suit a purpose with less fear of unexpected results that may be more common in other ML models. Like, KF(S, x) will always return an explainable new state, where NN(x) may result in a surprise state and no amount of analysis can reveal why (and require training a new model, the “retrain and pray” solution).There’s a couple of differences for you. reply corethree 17 hours agorootparentAnything with an input and an output is replaceable by NNs nowadays. reply FirmwareBurner 16 hours agorootparentBecause of \"resume driven engineering\".

And it can be computed cheaply, like on the Apollo guidance computer.You basically need to know some kind of a model for the system to run KF. Whereas ML is all about working out the model automatically.As for similarities, KF is a really efficient implementation of Bayesian inference. I think that any ML model that isn&#x27;t fundamentally using Bayesian inference, is fundamentally flawed. reply wenc 15 hours agoparentprevML Models are usually used in the context of prediction, Y = F(X,θ), where X = inputs, θ = weights, F = model. There&#x27;s typically no explicit feedback look (only historical data), no time-variation (you can add using lags however), and no existing model structure in most cases (most are black boxes, some like linear regression have a linear model which are fairly loose).Kalman Filters are used in the context of a very specific model-type for dynamic systems (a state-space model, see below) to update states (xₖ) using feedback data from sensors (yₖ). These state-space models can either be derived by fitting data, or they can be derived from first principles through physics equations. xₖ₊₁ = f(xₖ) + g(uₖ) yₖ = h(xₖ)The feedback loop is modeled explicitly, including any control actions (uₖ) that you took to affect the environment.For instance, when driving a car, examples of states (x) are position&#x2F;velocity&#x2F;acceleration (which might not be directly measured with a sensor! But can be backed out from a mathematical model from quantities that are measured), sensor measurements (y) might be speedometer, accelerometer readings, and control actions (u) might be throttle position, brake pressure, steering angle. The Kalman filter has a model relating all this in time, and based on that model and sensor readings, it reconstructs&#x2F;infers the likeliest states in the presence of even noisy measurements. This is why Kalman filters are known as \"state estimation\" algorithms.ML models typically do not do this -- they only predict. Kalman filters predict and update. reply nyrikki 17 hours agoparentprevIt is chalk and cheese.ML requires training, significant amounts of compute power, and large datasets.The Apollo program used Kalman filters with limited compute resources.Kalman filters are for predicting system states in the presence of uncertainty; ML is really searching for and matching patterns, under uncertainty not in its training set, it tends to to find the glitch in the matrix. reply radarsat1 18 hours agoparentprevYou could probably call a Kalman filter an ML model if you wish. One major difference is that you usually have to prescribe the prediction model. It doesn&#x27;t learn to predict the next value like an LLM, instead it learns to find an optimal weighted sum of its prediction and the measured values. So it&#x27;s a prediction-correction loop that requires an interpretable model, that has the side effect of allowing you to estimate system states. This is quite different than having an arbitrary hidden state with learned structure.In other words it performs well for certain applications specifically because it allows you to bring in domain knowledge in the form of the process model and known uncertainties. Whereas deep learning models try to generalize the model and learn implicit structure from data. reply greesil 17 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s Bayesian, and you specify what the model is. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of data, and the model is a good match for reality that can be a good thing.

However, care is needed to ensure the result gives a valid updated rotation and that you implement the disgustingly messy equations correctly. reply ms512 15 hours agoparentprevI used them extensively when I worked on Radar contact tracking.

    "originBody": "Ken Shirriff's blog Computer history, restoring vintage computers, IC reverse engineering, and whatever Examining the silicon dies of the Intel 386 processor You might think of the Intel 386 processor (1985) as just an early processor in the x86 line, but the 386 was a critical turning point for modern computing in several ways.1 First, the 386 moved the x86 architecture to 32 bits, defining the dominant computing architecture for the rest of the 20th century. The 386 also established the overwhelming importance of x86, not just for Intel, but for the entire computer industry. Finally, the 386 ended IBM's control over the PC market, turning Compaq into the architectural leader. In this blog post, I look at die photos of the Intel 386 processor and explain what they reveal about the history of the processor, such as the move from the 1.5 µm process to the 1 µm process. You might expect that Intel simply made the same 386 chip at a smaller scale, but there were substantial changes to the chip's layout, even some visible to the naked eye.2 I also look at why the 386 SL had over three times the transistors as the other 386 versions.3 The 80386 was a major advancement over the 286: it implemented a 32-bit architecture, added more instructions, and supported 4-gigabyte segments. The 386 is a complicated processor (by 1980s standards), with 285,000 transistors, ten times the number of the original 8086.4 The 386 has eight logical units that are pipelined5 and operate mostly autonomously.6 The diagram below shows the internal structure of the 386.7 The 386 with the main functional blocks labeled. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version. I created this image using a die photo from Antoine Bercovici. The heart of a processor is the datapath, the components that hold and process data. In the 386, these components are in the lower left: the ALU (Arithmetic/Logic Unit), a barrel shifter to shift data, and the registers. These components form regular rectangular blocks, 32 bits wide. The datapath, along with the circuitry to the left that manages it, forms the Data Unit. In the lower right is the microcode ROM, which breaks down machine instructions into micro-instructions, the low-level steps of the instruction. The microcode ROM, along with the microcode engine circuitry, forms the Control Unit. The 386 has a complicated instruction format. The Instruction Decode Unit breaks apart an instruction into its component parts and generates a pointer to the microcode that implements the instruction. The instruction queue holds three decoded instructions. To improve performance, the Prefetch Unit reads instructions from memory before they are needed, and stores them in the 16-byte prefetch queue.8 The 386 implements segmented memory and virtual memory, with access protection.9 The Memory Management Unit consists of the Segment Unit and the Paging Unit: the Segment Unit translates a logical address to a linear address, while the Paging Unit translates the linear address to a physical address. The segment descriptor cache and page cache (TLB) hold data about segments and pages; the 386 has no on-chip instruction or data cache.10 The Bus Interface Unit in the upper right handles communication between the 386 and the external memory and devices. Silicon dies are often labeled with the initials of the designers. The 386 DX, however, has an unusually large number of initials. In the image below, I have enlarged the tiny initials so they are visible. I think the designers put their initials next to the unit they worked on, but I haven't been able to identify most of the names.11 The 386 die with the initials magnified. The shrink from 1.5 µm to 1 µm The original 386 was built on a process called CHMOS-III that had 1.5 µm features (specifically the gate channel length for a transistor). Around 1987, Intel moved to an improved process called CHMOS-IV, with 1 µm features, permitting a considerably smaller die for the 386. However, shrinking the layout wasn't a simple mechanical process. Instead, many changes were made to the chip, as shown in the comparison diagram below. Most visibly, the Instruction Decode Unit and the Protection Unit in the center-right are horizontal in the smaller die, rather than vertical. The standard-cell logic (discussed later) is considerably more dense, probably due to improved layout algorithms. The data path (left) was highly optimized in the original so it remained essentially unchanged, but smaller. One complication is that the bond pads around the border needed to remain the same size so bond wires could be attached. To fit the pads around the smaller die, many of the pads are staggered. Because different parts of the die shrank differently, the blocks no longer fit together as compactly, creating wasted space at the bottom of the die. For some reason, the numerous initials on the original 386 die were removed. Finally, the new die was labeled 80C386I with a copyright date of 1985, 1987; it is unclear what \"C\" and \"I\" indicate. Comparison of the 1.5 µm die and the 1 µm die at the same scale. Photos courtesy of Antoine Bercovici. The change from 1.5 µm to 1 µm may not sound significant, but it reduced the die size by 60%. This allowed more dies on a wafer, substantially dropping the manufacturing cost.12 The strategy of shrinking a processor to a new process before designing a new microarchitecture for the process became Intel's tick-tock strategy. The 386 SX In 1988, Intel introduced the 386 SX processor, the low-cost version of the 386, with a 16-bit bus instead of a 32-bit bus. (This is reminiscent of the 8088 processor with an 8-bit bus versus the 8086 processor with a 16-bit bus.) According to the 386 oral history, the cost of the original 386 die decreased to the point where the chip's package cost about as much as the die. By reducing the number of pins, the 386 SX could be put in a one-dollar plastic package and sold for a considerably reduced price. The SX allowed Intel to segment the market, moving low-end customers from the 286 to the 386 SX, while preserving the higher sales price of the original 386, now called the DX.13 In 1988, Intel sold the 386 SX for $219, at least $100 less than the 386 DX. A complete SX computer could be $1000 cheaper than a similar DX model. For compatibility with older 16-bit peripherals, the original 386 was designed to support a mixture of 16-bit and 32-bit buses, dynamically switching on a cycle-by-cycle basis if needed. Because 16-bit support was built into the 386, the 386 SX didn't require much design work. (Unlike the 8088, which required a redesign of the 8086's bus interface unit.) The 386 SX was built at both 1.5 µm and 1 µm. The diagram below compares the two sizes of the 386 SX die. These photos may look identical to the 386 DX photos in the previous section, but close examination shows a few differences. Since the 386 SX uses fewer pins, it has fewer bond pads, eliminating the staggered pads of the shrunk 386 DX. There are a few differences at the bottom of the chip, with wiring in much of the 386 DX's wasted space. Comparison of two dies for the 386 SX. Photos courtesy of Antoine Bercovici. Comparing the two SX revisions, the larger die is labeled \"80P9\"; Intel's internal name for the chip was \"P9\", using their confusing series of P numbers. The shrunk die is labeled \"80386SX\", which makes more sense. The larger die is copyright 1985, 1987, while the shrunk die (which should be newer) is copyright 1985 for some reason. The larger die has mostly the same initials as the DX, with a few changes. The shrunk die has about 21 sets of initials. The 386 SL die The 386 SL (1990) was a major extension to the 386, combining a 386 core and other functions on one chip to save power and space. Named \"SuperSet\", it was designed to corner the notebook PC market.14 The 386 SL chip included an ISA bus controller, power management logic, a cache controller for an external cache, and the main memory controller. Looking at the die photo below, the 386 core itself takes up about 1/4 of the SL's die. The 386 core is very close to the standard 386 DX, but there are a few visible differences. Most visibly, the bond pads and pin drivers have been removed from the core. There are also some circuitry changes. For instance, the 386 SL core supports the System Management Mode, which suspends normal execution, allowing power management and other low-level hardware tasks to be performed outside the regular operating system. System Management Mode is now a standard part of the x86 line, but it was introduced in the 386 SL. The 386 SL die with functional blocks labeled. Die photo courtesy of Antoine Bercovici. In total, the 386 SL contains 855,000 transistors,15 over 3 times as many as the regular 386 DX. The cache tag RAM takes up a lot of space and transistors. The cache data itself is external; this on-chip circuitry just manages the cache. The other new components are largely implemented with standard-cell logic (discussed below); this is visible as uniform stripes of circuitry, most clearly in the ISA bus controller. A brief history of the 386 From the modern perspective, it seems obvious for Intel to extend the x86 line from the 286 to the 386, while keeping backward compatibility. But at the time, this path was anything but clear. This history starts in the late 1970s, when Intel decided to build a \"micromainframe\" processor, an advanced 32-bit processor for object-oriented programming that had objects, interprocess communication, and memory protection implemented in the CPU. This overly ambitious project fell behind schedule, so Intel created a stopgap processor to sell until the micromainframe processor was ready. This stopgap processor was the 16-bit 8086 processor (1978). In 1981, IBM decided to use the Intel 8088 (an 8086 variant) in the IBM Personal Computer (PC), but Intel did not realize the importance of this at the time. Instead, Intel was focused on their micromainframe processor, also released in 1981 as the iAPX 432, but this became \"one of the great disaster stories of modern computing\" as the New York Times called it. Intel then reimplemented the ideas of the ill-fated iAPX 432 on top of a RISC architecture, creating the more successful i960. Meanwhile, things weren't going well at first for the 286 processor, the follow-on to the 808616. Bill Gates and others called its design \"brain-damaged\". IBM was unenthusiastic about the 286 for their own reasons.17 As a result, the 386 project was a low priority for Intel and the 386 team felt that it was the \"stepchild\"; internally, the 386 was pitched as another stopgap, not Intel's \"official\" 32-bit processor. Despite the lack of corporate enthusiasm, the 386 team came up with two proposals to extend the 286 to a 32-bit architecture. The first was a minimal approach to extend the existing registers and address space to 32 bits. The more ambitious proposal would add more registers and create a 32-bit instruction set that was significantly different from the 8086's 16-bit instruction set. At the time, the IBM PC was still relatively new, so the importance of the installed base of software wasn't obvious; software compatibility was viewed as a \"nice to have\" feature rather than essential. After much debate, the decision was made around the end of 1982 to go with the minimal proposal, but supporting both segments and flat addressing, while keeping compatibility with the 286. By 1984, though, the PC industry was booming and the 286 was proving to be a success. This produced enormous political benefits for the 386 team, who saw the project change from \"stepchild\" to \"king\". Intel introduced the 386 in 1985, which was otherwise \"a miserable year for Intel and the rest of the semiconductor industry,\" as Intel's annual report put it. Due to an industry-wide business slowdown, Intel's net income \"essentially disappeared.\" Moreover, facing heavy competition from Japan, Intel dropped out of the DRAM business, a crushing blow for a company that got its start in the memory industry. Fortunately, the 386 would change everything. Given IBM's success with the IBM PC, Intel was puzzled that IBM wasn't interested in the 386 processor, but IBM had a strategy of their own.18 By this time, the IBM PC was being cloned by many competitors, but IBM had a plan to regain control of the PC architecture and thus the market: in 1987, IBM introduced the PS/2 line. These new computers ran the OS/2 operating system instead of Windows and used the proprietary Micro Channel architecture.19 IBM used multiple engineering and legal strategies to make cloning the PS/2 slow, expensive, and risky, so IBM expected they could take back the market from the clones. Compaq took the risky approach of ignoring IBM and following their own architectural direction.20 Compaq introduced the high-end Deskpro 386 line in September 1986, becoming the first major company to build 386-based computers. An \"executive\" system, the Deskpro 386 model 40 had a 40-megabyte hard drive and sold for $6449 (over $15,000 in current dollars). Compaq's gamble paid off and the Deskpro 386 was a rousing success. The Compaq Deskpro 386 in front of the 386 processor (not to scale). From PC Tech Journal, 1987. Curiously, the die image of the 386 has been mirrored, as can be seen both from the positions of the microcode ROM and instruction decoder at the top as well as from the position of the cut corner of the package. As for IBM, the PS/2 line was largely unsuccessful and failed to become the standard. Rather than regaining control over the PC, \"IBM lost control of the PC standard in 1987 when it introduced its PS/2 line of systems.\"21 IBM exited the PC market in 2004, selling the business to Lenovo. One slightly hyperbolic book title summed it up: \"Compaq Ended IBM's PC Domination and Helped Invent Modern Computing\". The 386 was a huge moneymaker for Intel, leading to Intel's first billion-dollar quarter in 1990. It cemented the importance of the x86 architecture, not just for Intel but for the entire computing industry, dominating the market up to the present day.22 How the 386 was designed The design process of the 386 is interesting because it illustrates Intel's migration to automated design systems and heavier use of simulation.23 At the time, Intel was behind the industry in its use of tools so the leaders of the 386 realized that more automation would be necessary to build a complex chip like the 386 on schedule. By making a large investment in automated tools, the 386 team completed the design ahead of schedule. Along with proprietary CAD tools, the team made heavy use of standard Unix tools such as sed, awk, grep, and make to manage the various design databases. The 386 posed new design challenges compared to the previous 286 processor. The 386 was much more complex, with twice the transistors. But the 386 also used fundamentally different circuitry. While the 286 and earlier processors were built from NMOS transistors, the 386 moved to CMOS (the technology still used today). Intel's CMOS process was called CHMOS-III (complementary high-performance metal-oxide-silicon) and had a feature size of 1.5 µm. CHMOS-III was based on Intel's HMOS-III process (used for the 286), but extended to CMOS. Moreover, the CHMOS process provided two layers of metal instead of one, changing how signals were routed on the chip and requiring new design techniques. The diagram below shows a cross-section through a CHMOS-III circuit, with an NMOS transistor on the left and a PMOS transistor on the right. Note the jagged three-dimensional topography that is formed as layers cross each other (unlike modern polished wafers). This resulted in the \"forbidden gap\" problem that caused difficulty for the 386 team. Specifically second-layer metal (M2) could be close to the first-layer metal (M1) or it could be far apart, but an in-between distance would cause problems: the forbidden gap. If the metal layer crossed in the \"forbidden gap\", the metal could crack and whiskers of metal would touch, causing the chip to fail. These problems reduced the yield of the 386. A cross-section of circuitry formed with the CHMOS-III process. From A double layer metal CHMOS III technology. The design of the 386 proceeded both top-down, starting with the architecture definition, and bottom-up, designing standard cells and other basic circuits at the transistor level. The processor's microcode, the software that controlled the chip, was a fundamental component. It was designed with two CAD tools: an assembler and microcode rule checker. The high-level design of the chip (register-level RTL) was created and refined until clock-by-clock and phase-by-phase timing were represented. The RTL was programmed in MAINSAIL, a portable Algol-like language based on SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language). Intel used a proprietary simulator called Microsim to simulate the RTL, stating that full-chip RTL simulation was \"the single most important simulation model of the 80386\". The next step was to convert this high-level design into a detailed logic design, specifying the gates and other circuitry using Eden, a proprietary schematics-capture system. Simulating the logic design required a dedicated IBM 3083 mainframe that compared it against the RTL simulations. Next, the circuit design phase created the transistor-level design. The chip layout was performed on Applicon and Eden graphics systems. The layout started with critical blocks such as the ALU and barrel shifter. To meet the performance requirements, the TLB (translation lookaside buffer) for the paging mechanism required a creative design, as did the binary adders. Examples of standard cells used in the 386. From \"Automatic Place and Route Used on the 80386\" by Joseph Krauskopf and Pat Gelsinger, Intel Technology Journal spring 1986. I have added color. The \"random\" (unstructured) logic was implemented with standard cells, rather than the transistor-by-transistor design of earlier processors. The idea of standard cells is to have fixed blocks of circuitry (above) for logic gates, flip-flops, and other basic functions.24 These cells are arranged in rows by software to implement the specified logic description. The space between the rows is used as a wiring channel for connections between the cells. The disadvantage of a standard cell layout is that it generally takes up more space than an optimized hand-drawn layout, but it is much faster to create and easier to modify. These standard cells are visible in the die as regular rows of circuitry. Intel used the TimberWolf automatic placement and routing package, which used simulated annealing to optimize the placement of cells. TimberWolf was built by a Berkeley grad student; one 386 engineer said, \"If management had known that we were using a tool by some grad student as the key part of the methodology, they would never have let us use it. \" Automated layout was a new thing at Intel; using it improved the schedule, but the lower density raised the risk that the chip would be too large. Standard cells in the 386. Each row consists of numerous standard cells packed together. Each cell is a simple circuit such as a logic gate or flip flop. The wide wiring channels between the rows hold the wiring that connects the cells. This block of circuitry is in the bottom center of the chip. The data path consists of the registers, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), barrel shifter, and multiply/divide unit that process the 32-bit data. Because the data path is critical to the performance of the system, it was laid out by hand using a CALMA system. The designers could optimize the layout, taking advantage of regularities in the circuitry, optimizing the shape and size of each transistor and fitting them together like puzzle pieces. The data path is visible on the left side of the die, forming orderly 32-bit-wide rectangles in contrast to the tangles of logic next to it. Once the transistor-level layout was complete, Intel's Hierarchical Connectivity Verification System checked that the final layout matched the schematics and adhered to the process design rules. The 386 set an Intel speed record, taking just 11 days from completing the layout to \"tapeout\", when the chip data is sent on magnetic tape to the mask fabrication company. (The tapeout team was led by Pat Gelsinger, who later became CEO of Intel.) After the glass masks were created using an electron-beam process, Intel's \"Fab 3\" in Livermore (the first to wear the bunnysuits) produced the 386 silicon wafers. Chip designers like to claim that their chip worked the first time, but that was not the case for the 386. When the team received the first silicon for the 386, they ran a trivial do-nothing test program, \"NoOp, NoOp, Halt\", and it failed. Fortunately, they found a small fix to a PLA (Programmable Logic Array). Rather than create new masks, they were able to patch the existing mask with ion milling and get new wafers quickly. These wafers worked well enough that they could start the long cycles of debugging and fixing. Once the processor was released, the problems weren't over.25 Some early 386 processors had a 32-bit multiply problem, where some arguments would unpredictably produce the wrong results under particular temperature/voltage/frequency conditions. (This is unrelated to the famous Pentium FDIV bug that cost Intel $475 million.) The root cause was a layout problem, not a logic problem; they didn't allow enough margin to handle the worst case data in combination with manufacturing process and environment factors. This tricky problem didn't show up in simulation or chip verification, but was only found in stress testing. Intel sold the faulty processors, but marked them as only valid for 16-bit software, while marking the good processors with a double sigma, as seen below.26 This led to embarrassing headlines such as Some 386 Systems Won't Run 32-Bit Software, Intel Says. The multiply bug also caused a shortage of 386 chips in 1987 and 1988 as Intel redesigned the chip to fix the bug. Overall, the 386 issues probably weren't any worse than other processors and the problems were soon forgotten. Bad and good versions of the 386. Note the labels on the bottom line. Photos (L), (R) by Thomas Nguyen, (CC BY-SA 4.0). Conclusions A 17-foot tall plot of the 386. The datapath is on the left and the microcode is in the lower right. It is unclear if this is engineering work or an exhibit at MOMA. Image spliced together from the 1985 annual report. The 386 processor was a key turning point for Intel. Intel's previous processors sold very well, but this was largely due to heavy marketing (\"Operation Crush\") and the good fortune to be selected for the IBM PC. Intel was technologically behind the competition, especially Motorola. Motorola had introduced the 68000 processor in 1979, starting a powerful line of (more-or-less) 32-bit processors. Intel, on the other hand, lagged with the \"brain-damaged\" 16-bit 286 processor in 1982. Intel was also slow with the transition to CMOS; Motorola had moved to CMOS in 1984 with the 68020. The 386 provided the necessary technological boost for Intel, moving to a 32-bit architecture, transitioning to CMOS, and fixing the 286's memory model and multitasking limitations, while maintaining compatibility with the earlier x86 processors. The overwhelming success of the 386 solidified the dominance of the x86 and Intel, and put other processor manufacturers on the defensive. Compaq used the 386 to take over PC architecture leadership from IBM, leading to the success of Compaq, Dell, and other companies, while IBM eventually departed the PC market entirely. Thus, the 386 had an oversized effect on the computer industry, shaping the winners and losers for decades. I plan to write more about the 386, so follow me on Twitter @kenshirriff or RSS for updates. I'm also on Mastodon occasionally as @kenshirriff@oldbytes.space.

Notes and references The 386 also changed the industry because Intel abandoned the standard practice of second sourcing (allowing other companies to manufacture a chip). AMD, for example, had been a second source for the 286. But Intel decided to keep production of the 386 to themselves. Intel ended up licensing the 386 to IBM, though, as the IBM 386SLC. Despite the name, this was the 386 SX, not the 386 SL. ↩ Intel made various keychains containing the 386 die, as shown at CPU World. If you know where to look, it is easy to distinguish the variants. In particular, look at the instruction decoders above the microcode and see if they are oriented vertically (pre-shrink 386) or horizontally (post-shrink 386). ↩ The naming of the 386 versions is a bit of a mess. The 386 started as the 80386 and later the i386. The 80386SX was introduced in 1988; this is the version with a 16-bit bus. The \"regular\" 386 was then renamed the DX to distinguish it from the SX. There are several other versions of the 386 that I won't discuss here, such as the EX, CXSB, and 80376. See Wikipedia for details. Confusingly, the 486 also used the SX and DX names, but in a different way. The 486 DX was the original that included a floating-point unit, while floating-point was disabled in the 486 SX. Thus, in both cases \"DX\" was the full chip, while \"SX\" was the low-cost version, but the removed functionality was entirely different. Another complication is that a 386DX chip will have a marking like \"SX217\", but this has nothing to do with the 386 SX. SX217 is an Intel S-Specification number, which specifies the particular stepping of the processor, indicating a manufacturing change or if a feature has been fixed or removed. ↩ Counting transistors isn't as straightforward as you might think. For example, a ROM may have a transistor for a 1 bit and no transistor for a 0 bit. Thus, the number of transistors depends on the data stored in the ROM. Likewise, a PLA has transistors present or absent in a grid, depending on the desired logic functions. For this reason, transistor counts are usually the number of \"transistor sites\", locations that could have a transistor, even if a transistor is not physically present. In the case of the 386, it has 285,000 transistor sites and 181,000 actual transistors (source), so over 100,000 reported transistors don't actually exist. I'll also point out that most sources claim 275,000 transistors for the 386. My assumption is that 285,000 is the more accurate number (since this source distinguishes between transistor sites and physical transistors), while 275,000 is the rounded number. ↩ The 386's independent, pipelined functional units provide a significant performance improvement and the pipeline can be executing up to eight instructions at one time. For instance, the 386's microcode engine permits some overlap between the end of one instruction and the beginning of the next, an overlap that speeds up the processor by about 9%. But note that instructions are still executed sequentially, taking multiple clocks per instruction, so it is nothing like the superscalar execution introduced in the Pentium. ↩ The diagram of the 386 die shows eight functional units. It can be compared to the block diagram below, which shows how the units are interconnected. Block diagram of the 386. From The Intel 80386—Architecture and Implementation. ↩ My labeled die diagram combines information from two Intel papers: The Intel 80386—Architecture and Implementation and Design and Test of the 80386. The former paper describes the eight functional units. The latter paper provides more details, but only shows six functional units. (The Control Unit and Data Unit are combined into the Execution Unit, while the Protection Test Unit is dropped as an independent unit.) Interestingly, the second paper is by Patrick Gelsinger, who is now CEO of Intel. Pat Gelsinger also wrote \"80386 Tapeout - Giving Birth to an Elephant\", which says there are nine functional units. I don't know what the ninth unit is, maybe the substrate bias generator? In any case, the count of functional units is flexible. Patrick Gelsinger's biography from his 80386 paper. ↩ The 386 has a 16-byte prefetch queue, but apparently only 12 bytes are used due to a pipeline bug (details). ↩ Static checks for access violations are performed by the Protection Test Unit, while dynamic checks are performed by the Segment Unit and the Paging Unit. ↩ The 386 was originally supposed to have an on-chip cache, but there wasn't room and the cache was dropped in the middle of the project. As it was, the 386 die barely fit into the lithography machine's field of view. ↩ It kind of looks like the die has the initials ET next to a telephone. Could this be a reference to the movie E.T. and its catchphrase \"E.T. phone home\"? \"SEC\" must be senior mask designer Shirley Carter. \"KF\" is engineer Kelly Fitzpatrick. \"PSR\" is probably Paul S. Ries who designed the 386's paging unit. ↩ I think that Intel used a 6\" (150mm) wafer for the 386. With a 10mm×10mm die, about 128 chips would fit on a wafer. But with a 6mm×6.5mm die, about 344 would fit on a wafer, over 2.5 times as many. (See Die per wafer estimator.) ↩ The 286 remained popular compared to the 386, probably due to its lower price. It wasn't until 1991 that the number of 386 units sold exceeded the 286 (source). Intel's revenue for the 386 was much, much higher than for the 286 though (source). ↩ The \"SuperSet\" consisted of the 386 SL along with the 82360SL peripheral I/O chip. The I/O chip contained various ISA bus peripherals, taking the place of multiple chips such as the 8259 that dated back to the 8080 processor. The I/O chip included DMA controllers, timers, interrupt controllers, a real time clock, serial ports, and a parallel port. It also had a hard disk interface, a floppy disk controller, and a keyboard controller. ↩ The 386 SL transistor count is from the Intel Microprocessor Quick Reference Guide, which contains information on most of Intel's processors. ↩ The 186 processor doesn't fit cleanly into the sequence of x86 processors. Specifically, the 186 is an incompatible side-branch, rather than something in the 286, 386, 486 sequence. The 186 was essentially an 8086 that included additional functionality (clock generator, interrupt controller, timers, etc.) to make it more suitable for an emedded system. The 186 was used in some personal computers, but it was incompatible with the IBM PC so it wasn't very popular. ↩ IBM didn't want to use the 286 because they were planning to reverse-engineer the 286 and make their own version, a 16-megahertz CMOS version. This was part of IBM's plan to regain control of the PC architecture with the PS/2. Intel told IBM that \"the fastest path to a 16-megahertz CMOS 286 is the 386 because it is CMOS and 16-megahertz\", but IBM continued on their own 286 path. Eventually, IBM gave up and used Intel's 286 in the PS/2. ↩ IBM might have been reluctant to support the 386 processor because of the risk of cutting into sales of IBM's mid-range 4300 mainframe line. An IBM 4381-2 system ran at about 3.3 MIPS and cost $500,000, about the same MIPS performance as 386/16 system for under $10,000. The systems aren't directly comparable, of course, but many customers could use the 386 for a fraction of the price. IBM's sales of 4300 and other systems declined sharply in 1987, but the decline was blamed on DEC's VAX systems. An IBM 4381 system. The 4381 processor is the large cabinet to the left of the terminals. The cabinets at the back are probably IBM 3380 disk drives. From an IBM 4381 brochure. ↩ The most lasting influence of the PS/2 was the round purple and green keyboard and mouse ports that were used by most PCs until USB obsoleted them. The PS2 ports are still available on some motherboards and gaming computers. The PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports on the back of a Gateway PC. ↩ When Compaq introduced their 386-based system, \"they warned IBM that it has but six months to announce a similar machine or be supplanted as the market's standard setter.\" (source). Compaq turned out to be correct. ↩ The quote is from Computer Structure and Logic. ↩ Whenever I mention x86's domination of the computing market, people bring up ARM, but ARM has a lot more market share in people's minds than in actual numbers. One research firm says that ARM has 15% of the laptop market share in 2023, expected to increase to 25% by 2027. (Surprisingly, Apple only has 90% of the ARM laptop market.) In the server market, just an estimated 8% of CPU shipments in 2023 were ARM. See Arm-based PCs to Nearly Double Market Share by 2027 and Digitimes. (Of course, mobile phones are almost entirely ARM.) ↩ Most of my section on the 386 design process is based on Design and Test of the 80386. The 386 oral history also provides information on the design process. The article Such a CAD! also describes Intel's CAD systems. Amusingly, I noticed that one of its figures (below) used a photo of the 386SL instead of the 386DX, with the result that the text is completely wrong. For instance, what it calls the microcode ROM is the cache tag RAM. Erroneous description of the 386 layout. I put an X through it so nobody reuses it. ↩ Intel has published a guide to their 1.5 micron CHMOS III cell library. I assume this is the same standard-cell library that was used for the logic in the 386. The library provided over 150 logic functions. It also provided cell-based versions of the Intel 80C51 microcontroller and various Intel support chips such as the 82C37A DMA controller, the 82C54 interval timer, and the 82C59 interrupt controller. Die photo of the 82360SL ISA Peripheral I/O Chip, from the 386 SL Data Book. Interestingly, the 386 SL's Peripheral I/O chip (the 82360SL) included the functionality of these support chips. Standard-cell construction is visible as the stripes in the die photo (above). Moreover, the layout of the die shows separated blocks, probably corresponding to each embedded chip. I expect that Intel designed standard-cell versions of the controller chips to embed in the I/O chip and then added the chips to the standard-cell library since they were available. ↩ For an example of the problems that could require a new stepping of the 386, see Intel backs off 80386 claims but denies chip recast needed (1986). It discusses multitasking issues with the 386, with Intel calling them \"minor imperfections\" that could cause \"little glitches\", while others suggested that the chip would need replacement. The bugs fixed in each stepping of the 386 are documented here. ↩ One curiosity about the 386 is the IBTS and XBTS instructions. The Insert Bit String and Extract Bit String instructions were implemented in the early 386 processors, but then removed in the B1 stepping. It's interesting that the bit string instructions were removed in the B1 stepping, the same stepping that fixed the 32-bit multiplication bug. Intel said that they were removed \"in order to use the area of the chip previously occupied for other microcircuitry\" (source). I wonder if Intel fixed the multiplication bug in microcode, and needed to discard the bit string operations to free up enough microcode space. Intel reused these opcodes in the 486 for the CMPXCHG instruction, but that caused conflicts with old 386 programs, so Intel changed the 486 opcodes in the B stepping. ↩ Since Antoine photographed many different 386 chips, I could correlate the S-Specs with the layout changes. I'll summarize the information here, in case anyone happens to want it. The larger DX layout is associated with SX213 and SX215. (Presumably the two are different, but nothing that I could see in the photographs.) The shrunk DX layout is associated with SX217, SX218, SX366, and SX544. The 386 SL image is SX621. ↩ Email This BlogThis!

One nit:> ...\"tapeout\", when the chip data is sent on magnetic tape to the mask fabrication company.That&#x27;s roughly true in a temporal sense, but it&#x27;s not where the term \"tapeout\" comes from. They could have shipped the data on a Winchester disk, and the event would still be called tapeout.In the earlier days of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing, you would literally \"tape out\" your circuit manually with black tape on a white board, typically in an enlarged form.\"Tapeout\" came to mean the point in time when you finished taping out your circuit and it was ready to be sent to be photographed and reduced and boards manufactured from the layout.There wasn&#x27;t even any \"data\" involved here, magnetic or otherwise.

The most interesting thing to me was how historically significant the 386SL turned out to be. I had always mentally slotted it as a cheap cut-down part for the emerging laptop market, but it actually was a relatively sophisticated (3X the transistors!) precursor of the modern SoC. reply rasz 4 hours agorootparentLevel of integration wasnt the thing that made 386SL special, there were 8088&#x2F;8086 SoCs before it like NEC V40 used in 1987 Zenith Eazy PC or V50 in 1988 Akai S1000 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NEC_V20#Variants_and_successor...What made 386SL special was introduction of System Management Mode (SMM).

The 386 is chugging through the stream of instructions sequentially, unlike modern processors. There are various clever optimizations, though. First, there is some pipelining, so the microcode for the next instruction can execute while the previous one is finishing. Second, the CPU has 16 bytes of prefetching, so instructions are fetched from memory asynchronously from their execution. So you know what instructions are executed and in what order, but the timing is fairly unpredictable.I should mention that microcode in the 386 is pretty different from micro-ops that modern processors run. They both break machine instructions down into smaller steps. But microcode runs sequentially, while micro-ops are sort of tossed into the CPU and run independently through a dataflow engine, with everything sorted out at the end to look sequential. Confusingly, modern processors use \"microcode\" to hold the micro-ops for complicated instructions that can&#x27;t be handled by the regular instruction decoder; this is sort of like old-style microcode, but not exactly. reply bonzini 16 hours agorootparentprevOut of order execution was introduced in the Pentium Pro, the Pentium was already able to execute two instructions per cycle but was still in-order.Note that this \"magic\" is mostly implemented not in microcode, but rather in hardwired logic. reply chasil 10 hours agorootparentprevOne of the assertions of RISC is that microcode is a performance penalty, to be avoided.And many have.\"To provide this rich set of instructions, CPUs used microcode to decode the user-visible instruction into a series of internal operations. This microcode represented perhaps 1⁄4 to 1⁄3 of the transistors of the overall design. If... the majority of these opcodes would never be used in practice, then this significant resource was being wasted.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Berkeley_RISC reply rasz 4 hours agorootparentprev386 is actually somewhat slower clock for clock than 286 for same 16bit code. So no, no optimizations. For example https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.itu.edu.tr&#x2F;kesgin&#x2F;mul06&#x2F;intel&#x2F;instr&#x2F;movs.html, 486 was only slightly optimized, it was Pentium where they finally started working on IPC. reply vikingerik 4 hours agorootparentRight, the 486 was only slightly optimized for IPC. Most of the 486&#x27;s performance over the 386DX was from its L1 cache (or just called CPU cache at the time, there weren&#x27;t different cache levels yet.) You can turn the cache off in a 486&#x27;s BIOS and it will be barely any faster than a 386 of the same clock speed. reply johnklos 16 hours agoparentprevEvery time I see something new on righto.com, I get excited!

(And I&#x27;ll argue with anyone who says it wasn&#x27;t a real 32-bit processor :-) But, yes, the 386 started the 32-bit x86 architecture on most (non-phone) computers today. reply peter_d_sherman 7 hours agorootparent [–] Excellent points!System&#x2F;360 is indeed interesting because (if my memory serves me) it was one of the first computational architectures to implement microcode (also, if I recall correctly, the necessity of updating of this microcode was one of the reasons that floppy drives were invented...)I&#x27;m also a fan of the Motorola 68000 -- I used to have an Amiga 1000 \"back in the day\". I&#x27;d choose it over any 8 or 16 bit CPU of the time period, but (correct me if I am wrong) it didn&#x27;t have an MMU -- which would have made it a less-than-ideal candidate for writing a modern-day Unix compatible operating system, although the authors of AmigaOS managed to pull off quite an impressive multitasking OS on it, despite this fact, nonetheless...Also, as a 32-bit architecture (as opposed to discrete single-package IC CPU) we&#x27;d probably additionally want to remember the VAX 11&#x2F;780 (1977) -- whose CPU was implemented as circuits of multiple simpler TTL IC&#x27;s...(Oh sure, IBM might have done something like that earlier -- but the VAX 11&#x2F;780 brought down the cost of IBM&#x27;s comparable computing offerings by at least one order of magnitude! -- Although, even so, the 11&#x2F;780 still would have been ridiculously expensive to the average person of that time period... (and yes, I know it was intended for mid-sized to large businesses, not people! :-))But anyway, great article, and yes, the IBM System&#x2F;360 and 68000 were indeed groundbreaking! replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

After all, the browser is supposed to be the user&#x27;s agent. Its job is to do what the user wants and fetch the content that the user asks for.Somewhere along the path, we&#x27;ve made a terrible turn and allowed the browsers to become agents of the web developers instead, gatekeeping on behalf of web sites, rather than serving the user&#x27;s interests.My ideal browser would load up a site like YouTube, and, knowing my already-configured preference for ad-free, minimalist layout, would present it as a Craigslist-style list of links with thumbnails, ignoring the mess of JS and CSS that the site&#x27;s developer futilely sends. reply atleta 6 hours agoparentLookig at it source (the page downloaded when you open a YT link pointing to a video), it&#x27;s almost certain that YT doesn&#x27;t load without JS. It&#x27;s not an html page with some extra functionality implemented in JS, it&#x27;s a web app that builds the web page you see from JS.So firefox can&#x27;t do much about it without actively trying to circumvent YT and YT specifically.I don&#x27;t think browsers made the turn you mention. It&#x27;s more like browsers became more and more capable and web developers made use of it. Sometimes it&#x27;s annoying because most websites are not websites anymore but apps (GUIs) that run in the browser and some of the web sites&#x2F;apps people use could never work without it. Sure, we could all deploy those apps onto our machines (or have them deploy automatically in a sandbox) and there were actually technologies that did just that (think java web start or whatever the name ended up being) but they lost to what we have now: running these apps in the browser.Also, you can&#x27;t have an ad-free experience if the price of using a service is that the ad is delivered to you. On YT you can buy a subscription and you&#x27;ll see no ads. But sure, most sites don&#x27;t offer this. reply mandmandam 11 minutes agorootparent> Also, you can&#x27;t have an ad-free experience if the price of using a service is that the ad is delivered to you. On YT you can buy a subscription and you&#x27;ll see no ads.Just to be very clear, those are not the only two possible options.YouTube - and Facebook, Google, Whatsapp, etc - are extraordinarily simple concepts. We don&#x27;t need private corporations running them for profit. In fact, it&#x27;s turning out really bad for us. reply BiteCode_dev 2 hours agoparentprevNow that DRM are part of the web standards, and TPM are generalized, it&#x27;s game over.I predict youtube will escalate this way:- Pump up aggressive anti ad block measures.- It will fail, so they will enforce DRM so that they have control.- It will not be enough, so they will ask to only serve DRM to \"trusted browsers\".- And it will not suffice, so the trusted browser will have to run on a trusted OS checked by hardware.That will work since almost nobody will take the risk to jailbreak their expensive device.And we will all have lost. reply _Algernon_ 1 hour agorootparentYoutube just isn&#x27;t valueable enough (in my mind), to get away with that. reply BiteCode_dev 27 minutes agorootparentThe new generation knows mostly the web through jailed devices called \"smartphones\".They will have no idea, and just assume that&#x27;s how things are.HN bubble strikes again. reply JodieBenitez 1 hour agorootparentprev> And we will all have lost.Or we will all be gone elsewhere ? reply BiteCode_dev 26 minutes agorootparentWho?

Storage and bandwith costs money. Unless we decided to somehow fund all of this through some sort of additional tax through the ISPs or governments, ads or subscriptions are a necessary evil. reply tgv 2 hours agorootparentStorage and bandwidth cost money, but not $14&#x2F;month. You can get a server for yourself for that kind of money, and I don&#x27;t think YouTube has a server per user. reply petree 1 minute agorootparentSure, it is definitely more expensive than I would like. But you still have the option to watch the ads if you don&#x27;t like paying a sub. Expecting it to be completely free is unrealistic though. reply marticode 2 hours agorootparentprevProducing content also cost money, and producers get a cut of the ads or the subscription. reply safety1st 2 hours agorootparentThis kind of fantasy microeconomics debate is silly at best, disingenuous at worst. We are talking about a company with $280B in revenue per year and one of the highest profit margins in America. How they spend that money is not connected to what is fair or what makes some kind of logical sense in your head. It&#x27;s connected to whatever will increase their profits further.All you are doing is laying down cover fire to support further advances by an abusive monopolist. YouTube&#x27;s financials don&#x27;t HAVE to add up. Google owns advertising for the entire Internet! The entirety of YT could be a loss leader just to suppress the growth of streaming video businesses outside of their control, and the Google monopoly would carry on. reply petree 8 minutes agorootparentHaving a loss leader like this is exactly monopolistic behavior though. The fact that Google are trying to make money from it is expected and more fair to their competitors than just having it completely free, and not having ads either. replypmontra 4 hours agoparentprevHow could that work, given that a web site can change its working every day?

Any time I accidentally click on or hover over some BS video my front page is full of clickbait spam and I need to manually clean up my watch history.I guess (?) it works for monetization, but the UX of YouTube and their pushing of clickbait content has become horrible over the past few years. I just wish they stopped trying to be \"smart\" about what I want to watch. I&#x27;m already paying for Premium, just give me an option to make Youtube stupid. reply _Algernon_ 4 hours agoparentThe option for making youtube stupid has always been there. It is called the subscription feed: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtube.com&#x2F;feed&#x2F;subscriptionsYou can hide all the other sections using an extension like UnHook: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unhook.app&#x2F; reply loveparade 3 hours agorootparentThanks, I wasn&#x27;t aware of Unhook. I know the I can use the subscriptions feed, but it doesn&#x27;t solve all problems. When I open YT on my phone, or on my TV, I still get blasted with recommendations and clickbait. When I search for a keyword I get relevant results interspersed with clickbaity content (similar to Google SEO spam), and so on. This problem permeates the whole YT experience because the business model is maximize engagement metrics and ad view time at all costs.Unhook looks good indeed, I guess I am just a bit frustrated that I need external extensions, many of which are linked in this thread, and hacks to fight against services that try to monetize my attention. Especially when I already pay for them. reply zeta0134 2 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve long since blocked the recommendation content. No sidebar, no end-of-video overlay, no homepage content at all. Just a search box, thanks. (And even that&#x27;s gotten functionally useless over the years; external search engines are much better at finding that one video I remember seeing but can&#x27;t seem to convince YT proper to actually show me.)Then again, I curate my subscriptions. Nobody I follow posts more than once every couple of weeks or so. Most days my subscription page looks the same as it did yesterday, so when I do have a new video to watch it&#x27;s more like a rare treat. reply ftk_ 1 hour agoprevHere&#x27;s how I use youtube, usually without opening web frontend at all:Install mpv and yt-dlp.Use play-with addon to open youtube or other video links directly in mpv.Periodically convert youtube subscriptions into OPML using an userscript.Import OPML into freetube or other RSS reader to check for new videos.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;addons.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;firefox&#x2F;addon&#x2F;play-with&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;theborg3of5&#x2F;Userscripts&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;youtu... reply ericra 12 hours agoprevThe link[1] to the Firefox add-on page on your Github repo is dead.

It doesn&#x27;t automatically redirect all YouTube pages you open.This however gives you the choice to open the pages you want in an alternative frontend.My use case is basically I browse the YT homepage and Shift+click the videos I want to watch.

Both focus on \"this is more private than watching on youtube\"It sounds like there is some kind of instance&#x2F;server which my client&#x2F;with a cleaner frontend will talk to.But how does that work and why can youtube not detect it and block it? reply ww520 8 hours agorootparentIf you open up the browser&#x27;s Web Developer Tools on the Youtube page and go to the Network tab, you can see all the requests and responses going between the webpage (client) and the servers. The Youtube video segments are downloaded from the googlevideo.com host. These alternative clients basically go directly to the googlevideo.com to download the video segments to play them back.Google uses DASH as the manifest file for streaming video. Each video has a corresponding DASH file. You can download the DASH manifest XML file from the Youtube page for the video. Then extract video segment URLs from the file. Those typically go to the googlevideo.com host. Google uses WebM as video container and VP9 for video encoding for the video segment, which most browsers support.Most streaming players (alternative players) use the MSE API (Media Source Extensions) to feed the downloaded video segment data to thetag to play the video. Most browsers support MSE these days. reply d3vr 11 hours agorootparentprevI wasn&#x27;t sure myself either, so I looked it up.- Piped [1] uses NewPipeExtractor [2] (which is also used by NewPipe) to parse YouTube responses.

Pioneered at the University of Michigan, histotripsy offers a promising alternative to cancer treatments such as surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, which often have significant side effects. Today, FDA officials awarded clearance to HistoSonics, a company co-founded in 2009 by U-M engineers and doctors for the use of histotripsy to destroy targeted liver tissue. A human trial underway since 2021 at the U-M Rogel Cancer Center and other locations has treated patients with primary and metastatic liver tumors via histotripsy, demonstrating the technology’s ability to meet the testing’s primary effectiveness and safety targets. The treatment head of the Edison Platform, designed for delivering histotripsy treatment. Image credit: Erica Bass, Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine “Histotripsy is an exciting new technology that, although it is in early stages of clinical use, may provide a noninvasive treatment option for patients with liver cancer. Hopefully it can be combined with systemic therapies for a synergistic therapeutic effect,” said Mishal Mendiratta-Lala, professor of radiology with Michigan Medicine and principal investigator on the trial at U-M. HistoSonics can now market and sell its histotripsy delivery platform, called Edison, to hospitals and medical professionals for use in liver treatments. The company is headquartered in Minneapolis, while its advanced research and development is located in Ann Arbor. Histotripsy works by using targeted ultrasound waves to form microbubbles within the tumor. The forces created as those bubbles form and collapse cause the mass to break apart, killing tumor cells and leaving the debris to be cleaned up by the immune system. Dr. Alex Duryea, Ph.D., Manager of Applied Research at HistoSonics, adjusts an ultrasound “phantom”—a gel mixed with red blood cells that serves as the test’s tumor—prior to performing a histotripsy treatment demonstration. Image credit: Erica Bass, Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine What that could mean for patients is treatment without the physical toll of radiation or chemotherapy, fewer concerns with drug compatibility, far shorter recovery times than with surgery and less treatment discomfort. This is possible because it is much easier to ensure that histotripsy treatments are hitting the tumor, and not healthy tissue, compared to radiation or invasive procedures. Histotripsy relies on focusing acoustic waves of high energy ultrasound to concentrate the energy enough to form bubbles, and the Edison machine can make sure that region is confined to the tumor. In contrast, radiation affects everything in its path through the body. In addition, the histotripsy system has onboard diagnostic ultrasound imaging, the kind used to see babies in the womb. It is used to plan and observe the treatment in real time. Physicians have a live view of the “bubble cloud” and how tissue is responding to the therapy. Zhen Xu, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, points to a bubble cloud generated by the Edison Platform’s transducer head during a histotripsy demonstration at HistoSonics. Image credit: Erica Bass, Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine And histotripsy’s potential benefits go beyond tumor destruction. In the last year, a pair of preclinical studies in rodents suggest that in the clean-up process, the immune system learns how to identify cancer cells as threats. This can enable the body to continue fighting the initial tumor and help activate a natural immune response to the cancer. In the first study, even after destroying only 50% to 75% of the liver tumor volume by histotripsy, the rats’ immune systems were able to clear away the rest, with no evidence of recurrence or metastases in more than 80% of animals. Earlier this year, a second study showed that histotripsy breaks down the cancer cell wall’s “cloak”—revealing proteins that the immune system can use to identify threats, known as antigens. These antigens are removed during surgery or destroyed during chemotherapy and radiation. By instead destroying a cancer cell’s outer wall, histotripsy lays bare the tumor antigens for the immune system to identify and use for targeted attacks on other cancer cells. Zhen Xu, Professor of Biomedical Engineering, looks on as she explains a histotripsy treatment demonstration. Image credit: Erica Bass, Rogel Cancer Center, Michigan Medicine “We want to leverage histotripsy’s immuno stimulation effects and hopefully combine them with immunotherapy or drug delivery,” said Zhen Xu, U-M professor of biomedical engineering, an inventor of the histotripsy approach and a co-founder of HistoSonics. “That will move histotripsy from a local therapy into one that can treat tumors globally all over the body and eventually into a cure. In terms of the cancer treatment, that will be the next step, and I feel very excited about the potential.” Xu and the University of Michigan have a financial interest in HistoSonics. The company was formed with support from U-M’s Coulter Translational Research Program and Innovation Partnerships, U-M’s hub for research commercialization.

Very shortly they’ll start asking why we wouldn’t use the same technology against terrorism. don’t you want to be safe are you supporting terrorists that will say.The problem with terrorism is that it’s very easy for everyone to be categorized as a terrorist(notice how much many terrorists there is than terror attacks), and this needs very very wide access and total control over the public. reply mjburgess 17 hours agoprevI&#x27;d like to advance a more productive argument for pro-privacy tech people. Often the reply is to claim that governments are lying when they try to &#x27;protect children&#x27; and the like.Having at least some experience with international police orgs, I can say that significant resources are dedicated to online crime (including CSAM) and their &#x27;lived reality&#x27; is very much expending significant resources because e2e prevents low-cost surveillance.So the attack line that &#x27;none of this is sincere&#x27; is actively unhelpful -- since so much of it is sincere, it comes across at best naïve.A better line, imv, is this: assume present goverments are entirely sincere. It doesnt matter. We cannot know the intentions of future governments. And we have good reasons to suppose that governments, in general, require extraordinary systems of checks-and-balances to be prevented from abuse of power.So I&#x27;d advise not attacking people who are, very often, actually thinking of the children -- you&#x27;re just antagonising the people in power. Rather, invite them to help you defend the liberal order of individual human rights that prevent state abuse of power. As a matter of fact, they really arent actually trying to create a secret police.Enabling state abuse of power has a far far higher negative outcome than marginal increases to the difficulty of policing some crimes. In many cases, police agencies can find ways into criminal networks and can access messages using traditional policing.A better rhetorical strategy here is supporting policing, providing significant additional tech expert resources to police, significant funding for &#x27;online detectives&#x27; -- whilst at the same time explaining the high risk against mass state incursion into all aspects of our lives. reply wkat4242 15 hours agoparent> Having at least some experience with international police orgs, I can say that significant resources are dedicated to online crime (including CSAM) and their &#x27;lived reality&#x27; is very much expending significant resources because e2e prevents low-cost surveillance.Yes, good police work costs money. Considering the importance of child sex abuse this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. And how effective do they think this is going to be? Obviously once a few people are caught the pedos are going to find another way of sharing their filth. Either offline or more obscure apps. Meaning the old police work like infiltration will be necessary again. Meanwhile us citizens end up with surveillance forever.It&#x27;s not going to help the children, it&#x27;s only going to make life worse for everyone.> So I&#x27;d advise not attacking people who are, very often, actually thinking of the children -- you&#x27;re just antagonising the people in power. Rather, invite them to help you defend the liberal order of individual human rights that prevent state abuse of power. As a matter of fact, they really arent actually trying to create a secret police.I doubt that. The US has done exactly that already since 2001. It&#x27;s pretty clear to me that Europe just wants to follow suit. The boys want their toys.And they are antagonising us obviously. What I don&#x27;t understand is how they themselves want to live in a society where their every word is being monitored. reply poiop 16 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately arguments like that don&#x27;t make much political sense since those capabilities already exists. It isn&#x27;t technical measures that protect rights but laws. A government could be draconian without surveillance technology. This sort of argument mainly appeals to technologist trying to deal with that they are making bank off private information.Snowden&#x27;s \"turnkey tyranny\"-argument is okay but requires specific knowledge and imagines things that haven&#x27;t happened which therefor is open to interpretation.I think the only real way to prevent something like this is to provide an alternative but that is also unlikely since it implies responsibility which the tech industry doesn&#x27;t like. reply t0bia_s 12 hours agorootparentAlternative to what exactly? Where is detailed methodology of planning CSAM? Where are trusted data that shows how many real abusers are on platforms like those mentioned to be monitored? Where are warrants that those data collection won&#x27;t be abused by officials?There will always be other platforms that provide secure communication for sharing illegal files. Massive collection of child porn sounds perfect for potential consumers.Also, most of child abuser&#x27;s are among people that are not strangers to victims, so they don&#x27;t even need IM for communication. reply sroussey 17 hours agoparentprevIt is not sincere because the sincere use case will beAnd we have good reasons to suppose that governments, in general, require extraordinary systems of checks-and-balances to be prevented from abuse of power.Look up this guy Snowden and the secret surveillance and rubber-stamping courts he exposed.

They 1) don&#x27;t understand this principle which is absolutely terrifying and frankly implausible 2) understand and don&#x27;t care, better to save hundreds of children now and let the continent of billions be crushed undet authoritarianism later or 3) they actually are just doing a \"think of the children\" to get the power they want.None of those options make me think informing them of the the error of their ways will yield any fruit. reply zoky 17 hours agoparentprevNot that I disagree with you at all, but what do you then say to the response that this is just a slippery slope fallacy? reply mjburgess 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a fallacy if you have a causal mechanism.I think it&#x27;s fairly well-evidenced by history that there are many mechanisms by which states &#x27;backslide&#x27; into abuse (indeed, that&#x27;s the term used today).Human rights are an invention of liberal states, hard won, against state power -- why have any at all? reply wkat4242 16 hours agorootparentprevThe recent leak of the Europol document begging for access to all this proves it&#x27;s not a fallacy.

It was insane how fast it happened. Click -> Bathroom -> boxes+guards+parkinglot. I mean, granted, leadership does[1] precious little other than looking for new ways to get rid of as many heads as possible, but it was still impressive.[1] Not counting the \"Instant VPs\" hired on from procurement offices, which is where virtually all new business comes from. Seriously, guys, just can the entire BD division and let the double dippers sell corner offices to their old pals. reply asynchronous 10 hours agoparentYeah it’s a good point, government “no comment policy” still exists, even if it’s in open source if it never got declassified congratulations, you have to pretend you can’t see it reply phendrenad2 10 hours agoparentprevSurely logic has prevailed over panic by now though? reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentSurely you’ve never worked in gov’t, hah! reply 3seashells 16 hours agoparentprevSuch reflexes are very easy exploited? One rugue person could take out key competent personal with one startup self delete script? reply MilStdJunkie 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m not sure leadership believed anyone was all that valuable. The general impression was (and still is, sadly) that we were all worth more fired as cost savings than we were employed[1]. The only thing keeping them from doing your kind of shenanigan was probably the hit to NIST &#x2F; FEDRAMP &#x2F; whatever else that can get you blacklisted as a supplier.I remember one single exception. One of the regular rotating layoffs took out this one engineer who had extremely niche knowledge when it came to microphones. Like, there&#x27;s four other people on the planet who do the math this guy does. But he&#x27;s on the list, so there he goes. Pink slip, boxes, guards, parking lot . . and then they call him back in before he even gets everything packed. Someone must have run upstairs to yell at someone important - I mean, this guy wasn&#x27;t just \"make new things\" sort of skill, but also \"keep everything else working\" sort of skill, peppered with \"the FAA will get extremely angry if we don&#x27;t have this sort of thing\" skills. Luckily, he was a canny old gent, and replied on the spot: \"Sure. I&#x27;ll come back in. But it&#x27;s gonna cost ya.\" Rumor was he managed to double his wages, and get a stock thing to boot. That still brings a smile to my face, many years later.[1]The monkey wrench is that Cost Plus pays for hours, so they&#x27;re gonna try and get those hours cheap as they can. This is one of the reasons they haaaaaaaated hourly headcounts - see, you pressure your salaried people to stay 50-60 hours, but you keep billing the DoD for hours, and it&#x27;s like free money. Hourly, that doesn&#x27;t work so well. They converted literally everyone to salaried as soon as they possibly could. reply keepamovin 8 hours agorootparentHa! Great story. The lack of firm fixed price is truly a bane. reply Ms-J 11 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s well past time for the entire Snowden document collection to be released. But that won&#x27;t ever happen due to all the agreements each person or institution made with various governments who want to keep very embarrassing info on their illegal spying operations away from the public. reply krapp 10 hours agoparentIt won&#x27;t happen because the Snowden archives are the goose that keeps laying golden eggs for the media. Remember that journalism is first and foremost a business. reply kennyadam 16 hours agoprevI really hoped the entire collection of documents would have been disseminated by now.Surely it&#x27;s been long enough that anything in them that might compromise the security of undercover people or irrelevant personal information or whatever could have been redacted.It&#x27;s so frustrating. reply patmorgan23 7 hours agoparentDefinitely not. The US military plays the long game and works very hard to conceal its exact capabilities. That&#x27;s how you win wars, be more persistent, more capable, and surprise your enemies with your capabilities.There are undercover intelligence assets that have been undercover for 10-20 years. reply asynchronous 10 hours agoparentprevThe feds are extremely unwilling to declassify documents that have been leaked. They usually continue to deny details or the entire existence of them even decades after it’s “public knowledge” reply mike_d 10 hours agoparentprevLooking back it shines an interesting light on the motivations. Everything was filtered using a very specific politically motivated lens and lacked a lot of important context.You could steal all the emails of any HN user and cherry pick a few dozen to make them look like a monster, where I believe on the whole most users of this site are good people. reply spacebacon 10 hours agoprevFor those who fall into the camp that have never taken a security clearance before but have worked on more interesting tech ... why is this all so sensitive? Are we to ignore these capabilities as if they do not exist or what? Is there a handbook for stuff you read you probably shouldn&#x27;t know about or are we ready to accept the fact everything is hacked or can be hacked? Personally as an independent small timer with no cool or a secret accomplishment to date ....... assumed breach is my day to day reality. reply ofslidingfeet 10 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s sensitive because our government is full of criminals, and that makes it look bad. reply spacebacon 9 hours agorootparentReally? Do we have names and evidence or just feelings on this? From the outside looking in ... any institution feels dirty for the fact institutions sacrifice the individuals in favor of the institute. But is this criminal or systemic? Does the system define the crime or is there an individual to convict? reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentOne of hundreds of similar situations (literally) - [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motherjones.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2010&#x2F;03&#x2F;other-burn-pits...]And the US is actually a relatively good gov’t on this front. reply ofslidingfeet 8 hours agorootparentprevI personally would never work in intelligence because I&#x27;m capable of reading the big numbered list we can all see. reply spacebacon 8 hours agorootparentWhich list? reply asynchronous 10 hours agoparentprevAre you asking why classified documents are classified? Or why they remain classified after being leaked? reply spacebacon 10 hours agorootparentNeither but both are good questions. reply lazide 7 hours agorootparentIf they declassified them, they couldn’t go after people trying to get them, or stop their own people from reading them.They classify them because they either look bad, or would be helpful to enemies if they got out.And as long as they stay classified, they get to keep the courts, etc. from using them too. reply precompute 10 hours agoprevYawn. He could&#x27;ve leaked the entire thing at once way back in &#x27;13 if he really was serious about it. Ten year old documents about programs at least 15 years old are all but worthless now. There was a time to do something about it and he never exploited it. reply Ms-J 6 hours agoparentDumping is the way to go to really let people know about something serious. People will repost to torrents, file lockers, Discord channels, etc. reply Clubber 9 hours agoparentprevIIRC, he gave it all to the press and gave them the burden of going over them and releasing them as they saw fit. He was concerned about sensitive material getting out that would harm other US interests &#x2F; people on the ground, etc. Most outlets didn&#x27;t want it, but the Guardian picked them up and reported it.Assange was the one that just dumped documents, and look what happened to him. reply daft_pink 17 hours agoprevDoes GitHub usually store classified documents? reply jandrese 15 hours agoparentThis could be a problem. I know companies that will block entire sites if they&#x27;re hosting material like that, especially in the government contracting sphere. reply diogenes4 13 hours agoprevI love this, but a corporate site is probably not the best place for this. reply e12e 12 hours agoparentWas going to suggest Cryptome - but it was apparently closed this August in protest of the unfair case against Assange (Young tried to argue for being tried as a co-defendant, having published unredacted documents prior to WikiLeaks):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cryptome.org&#x2F; reply sgnelson 10 hours agorootparentI am confused by this. The guy who runs Cryptome (which is arguably a thorn in the side of the US intelligence services and US government) is telling the US government that if they don&#x27;t charge him with a crime (which if convicted could probably lead to the website being shutdown.), he&#x27;s going to shut down that website that exposes US intelligence secrets.Um. I just don&#x27;t know what to say about this. I&#x27;m so confused by this logic. I&#x27;m sure the people in the US Intelligence services are going to be crying themselves to sleep because Cryptome closes. I bet they&#x27;ll be begging US prosecutors to charge him with a crime just to keep Cryptome open. I just don&#x27;t get the logic behind this. Someone please explain it to me. reply keepamovin 8 hours agorootparentAlthough as other people have pointed out, the site might actually still be up… tho I think there’s a trend that is real, to do with the personality of people who get into this kind of “work”.I think one reason is… a lot of “personalities” in the leaker movement seem to have a pathological martyr-like demeanor (often amplified for good effect with a diva-like character too), which leads them to making these irrational own-goal “strategic win” protest moves, which might really just be them hitting the big red self-destruct buttons on their chest.Almost like it’s daddy issues writ large, and they want to do anything provocative just to get attention. Which kind of leads them to seemingly gauge their success by the question: “how much have I been oppressed today?”I think Snowden is remarkable for having avoided this common pitfall, leading to him having a longer shelf life.I don’t know that much about this it’s just a theory. reply Ms-J 11 hours agorootparentprevThe latest document that Cryptome is hosting on their homepage is \"Douglas Valentine Sues CIA for PHOENIX Documents\" dated October 14, 2023. I don&#x27;t see any indication to them remaining closed, though I could be mistaken. Do you have any references you could cite?Edit: I see a letter to American judge Hilton on Cryptome where Young states that he will be closing after 27 years until Assange is granted freedom, though the site remains alive and appears there is ongoing publishing, so I&#x27;m still unclear of the current status and any references regarding the status would be welcome. reply clubm8 17 hours agoprev [–] is this new and if not... why today? reply keepamovin 7 hours agoparentNo particular reason. I was watching the Snowden film for the first time, and at the same time fixing some bugs in secure document viewer code that required me to test it on large zip files (ideally containing PDFs). I just happened across this repo from a DDG search.You can see the ongoing work here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;BrowserBox&#x2F;BrowserBox reply imiric 13 hours agoparentprevBecause any day is a good day to be reminded of the surveillance machinery behind closed doors of a superpower government.Besides, I haven&#x27;t seen all Snowden files as neatly organized as here. These documents should be copied and reshared in perpetuity. reply diogenes4 13 hours agoparentprev [–] Better than tomorrow! replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I found it completely impossible. The content is all written by people (or ais) that had never visited. Everything reads like a middle school essay.I often resort to searches in a smaller language, where economic incentives are 100X smaller than English.Google created incentives for littering the web with garbage.

This was the golden age so to speak, it answered your question along with 10 others on a subject but also helped you to understand if your question was even the right one in the first place.With mobile, google shifted to trying to directly answer the question you asked and nothing else, presumably because people were far less willing to read large articles on mobile and just wanted fast answers.This latter approach is much easier to SEO garbage than the original that took real knowledge and effort to write. reply Roark66 1 hour agoparent>In the desktop search world, google used to respond with large comprehensive articles on subjects that not just answered peoples questions but also educated them on the subject around their question. This was the golden age so to speakIDK, for me it seems the worst plague are the sites that when you search for something like \"how to reverse a pushed commit in git\" don&#x27;t give you a single sentence answer you seek, but you scroll and scroll over, what is git, how it works, why do people use it, how to install it, if you&#x27;re lucky the answer will be at the very bottom after you clicked through the infuriating cookie consent and you closed two full page video ads.

What is it on the desktop with all the shitty sites that try detecting you&#x27;re moving to close it(often when you just move your mouse while reading) and they suddenly try to take over the entire window with some full page flashing modal dialogs. Insanity...My take on why this happened is twofold: 1- Google, yes. 2-the stupid cookie consent law of the EU. Yes, it made launching a huge window obscuring the entire site&#x27;s content on entry acceptable.

Keep in mind that Safari has existed since 2003, during which Apple was in a very different place — back then there was no App Store or even any hint that such a thing might exist at some point and OS X was going all-in on open standards compliance, with things like RSS support being major touted features, and WebKit was quickly approaching Gecko in being a top class web engine (as opposed to the dominant Trident and Tasman in IE and IE for Mac, respectively).As for in-app webviews, they’re not all made equally. Most apps use SFSafariViewController, which is an out-of-process Safari tab with its own app-specific cookies, local storage, etc that’s designed to give the user an opportunity to see if the page is really something they want to access and helps keeps their main browser’s tabs clean while also breaking several types of trackers. Of course though some notoriously nosy players like Facebook and TikTok don’t use this and instead implement their own which is chock full of tracking crap… this is probably an area where Apple could stand to be more heavyhanded (ban custom browser reimplementations except where those add demonstrable value or the app itself is a browser).Also, web app devs aren’t blameless in user preference for native apps. For every web app done right, there’s three more that are shoddy and frustrating in ways that native apps generally aren’t (think breaking back button, scrolljacking, etc), some that are just plain badly built, and many that are unrepentant resource hogs. Often this applies even to web apps that have no counterpart native apps because their companies chose the web solely because it’s cheap to do so (resulting in cheap bad web apps). Are there crappy native apps too? Sure, but they’re somewhat less common and generally keep the crappiness somewhat bounded. reply mnky9800n 1 hour agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve recently deleted Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, etc from my phone and it&#x27;s like night and day.

I think that is kinda inevitable.What will that mean for bona fide quality sites? I don&#x27;t know but part of me hopes that those detailed sites will flourish to offer more details than can be offered in a single LLM response. Wishful thinking perhaps.They&#x27;ll be a huge backlash of course from the click-bait sites - just like with news sites protesting about losing traffic. reply dageshi 1 hour agorootparentYes, I think the clickbait sites are done long term, people will just ask the AI on their phone.The people who were capable of writing those large detailed posts on subjects have most likely already moved to youtube or moved on.The data that&#x27;s actually useful to the LLM&#x27;s will exist in places like Discord, reddit, twitter. It&#x27;s pretty obvious that twitter and reddit are going to sell their data to the LLM companies for a lot of money.Which leaves Discord, I would be very suspicious of anyone trying to buy Discord... reply panta 1 hour agorootparentAdvertisers will simply begin to pay more money to inject their content on those platforms, to have it end up inside LLM models. It could be even worse, because it will be less obvious that the content we&#x27;ll be consuming through LLMs is polarized&#x2F;paid for. There will be less transparency. reply TheOtherHobbes 1 hour agorootparentYes, I think this is where we&#x27;re going.

Sites maintained mainly by individuals, universities, interest groups, source forges.There will always be a market for those sites, but they’re a little harder to find via Google lately. There was a time before Google was great, and it was an exciting time, too.What Google will continue to do great is provide a platform for quickly finding things you can pay money for.The only time I search Google is when I prefix the query with “buy”.

Which initiated moving features from being done locally to \"log in and sync in our cloud\", or dumbing features down on desktop, or downright removing them so that \"it&#x27;s the same on desktop and mobile\".Which IMO is related to the next thing in chain:- It was really easy to subscribe to an RSS feed in 2000s; if you had a proper meta tag in the website header, the browser UI would show up a prominent RSS logo in the URL bar. Firefox had this built-in. Apparently Chrome too [1]. At some point this was killed. Perhaps due to mobile gaining traction, lack of space on mobile, and Chrome&#x27;s annoying minimalist approach? Or perhaps because Google wanted to promote its own (R.I.P.) Google Reader, (R.I.P.) Google Wave, (R.I.P.) Google+?(Having said that, I must admit I have declared RSS bankruptcy at some point, after subscribing to _way_ too many feeds).- I remember there used to be a lot of blog platforms and discussion boards, people would write a lot of good stuff there, each of those platforms would create a de facto community.Then, Google managed to make Blogger&#x2F;Blogspot UX terrible; and most of other platforms died and got replaced with Facebook and Twitter. (I&#x27;m still not sure why many of those seemingly thriving platforms have died).- Facebook and Twitter over years slowly change the algo, to not show you stuff you subscribed to, but random viral crap which optimizes \"engangement\".[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;user-experience&#x2F;feed-subscriptions&#x2F; reply dalbasal 23 minutes agoparentprevThat shift (pc to smartphone) represents a lot more \"who and how many\" users than how they use it.As late as late 2000, web was still pretty exclusive club.

If you look at the birth of the web and how it became such a phenomenon, what we had back in those days as the dominant platform for end user applications was Win32. It was OK for its time but had limitations the web didn&#x27;t have, one of the biggest was - you had to get a user to install stuff locally.So what was necessary for the web to take off as an application platform was first some scrappy startups that saw the potential, Netscape creating Javascript was the first real opening salvo. And then when Microsoft realized the threat it went into overdrive and invented DHTML and arguably put more resources into the Web than a startup ever could, and then all this stuff started getting standardized and we got to enjoy 20 years of a new application platform where there was competition to control it and things were somewhat standardized and not totally monopolized.Notably most people just forgot about Win32 and quit building apps with it, which would have been considered unfathomable at the time. Win32 had had its day and faded into something comparatively niche. I don&#x27;t see why we wouldn&#x27;t have the same dynamic now if the Web eventually becomes as monopolized and stagnant as Win32 was. Or at least, I think this may be more likely than the Web somehow getting rescued by regulators or anyone else. reply seydor 4 minutes agoprevGoogle created SEO and has an interest to keep increasing the size and cost of SEO because the cost of SEO is directly related to the cost of their Ads (which are the best kind of SEO)That doesnt mean that the content of the internet is usless, but it is now buried under 3 pages of useless SEO blubber reply leobg 2 hours agoprevRecipe blogs are the most horrible example.

I truly meant \"impossible to game\".If I crawl your site today, encounter article A, and crawl it again in a year and again encounter article A, I am sure that article A is a year old (Well, techcnically, what I am certain of, is that I encountered the exact same article two times a year apart). You cannot game that. Now if another year later I encounter article A&#x27; where some content on the page has changed, be it sidebars, a new design, or a few paragraphs, I might say, \"some version of this article is two years old\" and decide to rank that different from \"this exact version is two years old\".Age is just one variable that I can think off. I&#x27;m quite certain there are more variables. But each and every one such variable must be completely controlled and verified by me- the search engine. Nothing external can be such a variable: not \"amount of articles that link to X\" nor \"amount of people that click through\".Maybe such variables don&#x27;t exist. Or maybe they do, but make for terrible ranking, IDK. But I do know that using variables that search-engines don&#x27;t control make for a terrible search experience over time. As can be witnessed and as is written down in the linked article. reply nologic01 25 minutes agoprev> Mr Suleyman said chatbots could “take on Google” by providing more accurate information than internet search.Excuse me for no longer taking any tech influencer promises at face value.

The fact, that Bing does not gain market share even though pushing everything ChatGPT related may confirms this notion.Content and consumer habits changed.In the 90th, website where dominated by text.

It didn&#x27;t give any sources, though I guess it may have been able to, but it was very confident in its answer and I only realised it was wrong because I was curious and wanted to find out more, but that certainly made me look at chatGPT differently. I don&#x27;t think LLMs are in any way the replacement for search engines, certainly not in their current form. reply danielbln 2 minutes agorootparentYes they are, though not in isolation. Additional mechanisms are needed to inject ground truth reliable knowledge into the LLM context. Don&#x27;t ask an isolated LLM about facts and expect no hallucinations. Instead, use ChatGPT with search plug-in, Bing search, Perplexity.ai or Phind.com (Im sure there are others). Once reliable truth available to the LLM via context, hallucinations go down _significantly_ to the point where (to me at least) it&#x27;s no longer really much of an issue. reply youngtaff 1 hour agoparentprevLLMs is how we ended up with the top google answer for “which african country begins with k” being nonsense> While there are 54 recognized countries in Africa, none of them begin with the letter \"K\".

If you can do it semi-reliably, you can put an API in front of it and sell it as \"prompt injector as a service\", and rake in the money. Couple more people do that, and all the ex-SEO scoundrels can get back to poisoning the commons for the highest bidder.(Open source, like always, will come to \"help\", and let any small scamgency run their own \"mix ads into content\" models locally.)The web will indeed change. But LLMs are like any other tool - they can be used for both good and for ill, and those using it for ill have much more money and drive.

Firstly, consumer decisions matter. They are not as effective as the law in directing the market, but they aren&#x27;t meaningless.Secondly, ethical decisions matter to me as an individual even if their utilitarian outcome isn&#x27;t clear.

BY ROWLAND WHITEPUBLISHED OCT 13, 2023 3:27 PM EDT THE WAR ZONE pixel17 via Wikicommons (Colorized Portrait) and Photo by Simon Watts/Getty Images (Mosquito) SHARE ROWLAND WHITE View Rowland White's Articles Matt Damon announces to the crowd, “We have an early Christmas present for you.” Kenneth Branagh takes over, holding court with an adoring audience. Playing General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, and nuclear physicist Niels Bohr respectively, the two A-listers herald the arrival of the Danish scientist at Los Alamos. This is the secret facility established in New Mexico in 1943 to build the first atom bomb and recreated 80 years later by Christopher Nolan to film his epic hit movie, Oppenheimer. “The British pilots put me in the bomb bay,” Branagh as Bohr laughingly recounts in his best Danish accent, they “showed me the oxygen — of course, I messed it up. When they opened me up in Scotland I was unconscious. I pretended I’d been napping.” The scene barely hints at the knife-edge circumstances of the Dane’s dramatic escape from Nazi-occupied Europe, nor the remarkable story behind his flight to safety. While researching my new book, Mosquito, about the U.K. Royal Air Force raid on the Gestapo headquarters in Copenhagen, I discovered the fascinating truth about both. At the time he joined the Manhattan Project, Niels Bohr was perhaps the most famous scientist in the world after Albert Einstein. His Danish homeland had been under German occupation since April 1940. Kenneth Branagh as nuclear physicist Niels Bohr, and the man himself, known to the British Special Operations Executive as the ‘Great Dane.’ via the author On the day of the invasion, the professor was in the lab in Copenhagen that he had set up, attempting to dissolve a pair of Nobel medals in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acid. Bohr was trying to stop the Nazis from getting their hands on two 23-karat-gold Nobels he’d been given for safekeeping by two Jewish German physicists fleeing the antisemitism of Hitler’s Germany. He’d auctioned off his own Nobel medal in 1940 to raise money for victims of Finland’s ‘Winter War’ with the Soviet Union. That he’d allowed the institute in Copenhagen that carried his name to provide sanctuary for those German exiles also spoke to his altruism. But it was also personal. By virtue of his Jewish mother, Niels Bohr was Jewish by heritage, if not through religious belief. German troops patrol the streets of Copenhagen, during the Nazi occupation of Denmark. Getty Images Britain’s Special Operations Executive (SOE), set up in 1940 with instructions from Winston Churchill to “set Europe ablaze” through sedition and sabotage, had first tried to prompt Bohr’s departure from Denmark in 1943 by sending a secret agent to the scientist’s home. Bohr’s polite rejection of London’s invitation was hidden beneath the stamps stuck to three separate postcards. Next time, SOE sent a written message, along with detailed instructions: “A small hole to a depth of 4mm has been bored in the two keys. The holes were plugged up and concealed after the message was inserted. Professor Bohr should gently file the keys at the point indicated until the hole appears. The message can then be syringed or floated out onto a micro-slide.” The message inside from Bohr’s friend Professor James Chadwick of Liverpool University was the size of a grain of sand and contained in a hole the width of a pinhead and had to be deciphered using a 600-power lens microscope. Chadwick urged him to leave Denmark for the United Kingdom, alluding to “a particular problem in which your assistance would be of the greatest help.” James Chadwick, photographed circa 1945. Los Alamos National Laboratory Chadwick, his fellow Nobel Laureate for his discovery of the neutron, was leading Britain’s research into the atomic bomb. Again, Bohr politely declined, feeling he could do more good in occupied Denmark, but he was in no doubt about the nature of the “particular problem” his friend alluded to. He just didn’t believe that given the current state of the art, an atomic bomb was feasible. Two months later Bohr reported to Chadwick that new information had convinced him that Germany had established the means to develop a nuclear reactor using uranium and heavy water. But as the British scientist prepared to take on a new role as head of the British Mission to the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, it still wasn’t enough to persuade the ‘Great Dane,’ as he was known to SOE, to leave Copenhagen. Supervised by the U.S. Army, the German experimental nuclear reactor is dismantled at Haigerloch, southwest Germany, in April 1945. U.S. Army It wasn’t until a Danish woman working for the Gestapo saw an order for Bohr’s arrest and tipped off Bohr’s brother, Harald, that the physicist finally accepted that he had to go. Evidence of imminent action by the Nazis against Denmark’s Jewish community and the threat to him specifically was now impossible to ignore. Senior SS personnel poured into Copenhagen. A large German ship, the Wartheland, was alongside harbor, ready to carry as many of the country’s 7,000 Jews as could be packed in. Bohr and his wife, Margarethe, left their home at the Carlsberg brewery estate within hours of the tip-off from Harald. As they slipped out of the back of their house a Nazi snatch squad was already on its way. When the couple later crawled on all-fours from a beach hut to a waiting boat, the most famous man in Denmark had with him a single bag, a beer bottle full of heavy water retrieved from the lab, and a sketch purporting to be of the Nazi’s reactor design. There had been no time to gather any more possessions before being smuggled across the strait to Sweden.

Photo by Mondadori via Getty Images Niels and Margarethe Bohr may have thought that, with their arrival in Malmø, they were safe from the clutches of the Nazis, but that was neither how the Gestapo nor Danish Army intelligence saw the situation. Like Madrid, Lisbon, or Casablanca, the capital of neutral Sweden was a hotbed of wartime intrigue, with spies from intelligence agencies from around the world operating side-by-side all competing for advantage. Secrets, lies, treachery, and deception were all common currency in Stockholm, and cutouts, agents, safe houses, dead drops, surveillance, and ciphers were the means by which they were traded. And with the arrival of the world’s most celebrated nuclear physicist, they had a prize worth playing for. At first, the Swedish authorities were reluctant to acknowledge that Bohr was at risk of abduction or assassination, telling the Danish Army captain charged with his protection, “This is Stockholm, not Chicago.” When it came to ruthlessness and brutality, the officer replied, there was no gangster that could compare to the Gestapo, and that “if anything happens to the professor it will be a disgrace to your country.” The captain never left Bohr’s side while he was in Sweden. But from now on, he was also joined by three armed Swedish secret police. Arriving in Stockholm, Bohr was bundled from a taxi into a house owned by Swedish intelligence, led through the attics to the other side of the building, and met by a second taxi, which took him to a safe house. The Danish scientist Niels Bohr in his laboratory in the 1940s. Photo by Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images Three days later, the Nazis moved against Denmark’s Jews as planned, but it was already too late. Alerted, like Bohr, to the imminent danger, they were taken in, hidden, and, over time, evacuated by their countrymen. Sweden, after lobbying from Bohr himself, agreed to take them all in. Of Denmark’s 7,000 or so Jews, just 284 of the weakest and most vulnerable had been arrested. It wasn’t even enough, remarked a crestfallen Nazi official “to justify the dispatch of a train to the concentration camp.” For Bohr himself to reach ultimate safety, he would now be relying on the ‘Stockholm Express.’ And, despite the name, it was not a train, but one of a small fleet of unarmed de Havilland Mosquito aircraft that, operated by British Airways’ precursor, BOAC — the British Overseas Airways Corporation — ran the gauntlet of Luftwaffe night-fighters to carry VIP passengers between RAF Leuchars in Scotland and Sweden’s Bromma Airport. Those passengers rode in the claustrophobic confines of the Masquitos' felt-lined bomb bays. The flight nearly killed Bohr. And for that, the Mosquito’s peerless performance was to blame. That bundling a VIP into the belly of a warplane was even an option was all down to ball bearings. BOAC Mosquitos carried a single passenger in the felt-lined bomb bay. They were given oxygen, a reading light, a blanket, and a flask of coffee for the two-and-a-half-hour flight. Crown Copyright For 35 years, the Swedish company SKF had led the world in the production of quality ball bearings, opening factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States. But with the advent of World War II, their plant in Luton, England, despite working day and night, couldn’t keep up with demand. Each Avro Lancaster bomber for the RAF required over 175 pounds of quality ball bearings and these aircraft were rolling off the production line at a rate of around 25 a week. But there were also Spitfires, Hurricanes, and plenty more besides. Britain had a huge variety of aircraft types in production, powered by a wide variety of different engines, and all required ball bearings of their own. Nor was it just aircraft. Tanks, armored cars, warships, and anti-aircraft guns all needed ball bearings. In fact, there were very few pieces of complex military machinery that didn’t. And that, of course, included the Merlin-engined Mosquito itself. A scene from an SKF ball-bearing plant, photographed soon after World War II. Photo by Walter Nurnberg/SSPL/Getty Images SOE ships carrying Swedish ball bearings first successfully ran the German blockade of the Skagerrak — the strait providing access between the North Sea and Sweden — in 1941. Since June 1942, though, BOAC had been running semi-regular courier flights along the 500-mile route between RAF Leuchars and Stockholm. The airbridge, so critical to both British intelligence and war industry, crossed some of the most hostile and heavily defended skies in the world, yet BOAC had struggled to find an aircraft to serve its needs. To begin with, the airline was given cast-off Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys. Slow and vulnerable, the obsolete RAF bombers were soon dispensed with in favor of new types acquired from the United States, small Lockheed Lodestars and Hudsons and a one-off, St. Louis, the first prototype of the new Curtiss C-46 Commando transport. The C-46 was capable of carrying heavy loads but remained vulnerable to the Luftwaffe. So too were the Douglas DC-3s that replaced it in the spring of 1943. The BOAC-operated Curtiss CW-20A (the prototype of the C-46), G-AGDI, named St. Louis, is refueled at Gibraltar, in 1941 or 1942. Crown Copyright At Leuchars, BOAC was very firmly of the view that “the Skagerrak is no place for a Dak” — a reference to the vulnerability of the Dakota, as the DC-3/C-47 was known in British service. But in the spring of 1943, the pressure to keep up the flights only intensified with a telegram from the British Minister in Stockholm, Sir Victor Mallett: “Since the need for at least 100 tons of bearings is desperate I recommend that risks should be taken as in any other wartime operation and that freight aircraft without passengers should fly regardless of bright nights throughout the summer months. If the Germans take to shooting them down the position can be reconsidered and at the worst, we will have lost one or two Dakotas and crews.” BOAC disagreed and, after trialing an alternative route to Sweden, concluded in a report that what was required was “an aircraft with great performance — speed, higher ceiling, and more endurance.” No. 105 Squadron Mosquito B.IVs. The B.IV was the first Mosquito to enter service with BOAC and remained popular with crews after the introduction of the subsequent FB.VI because it was a few miles per hour faster. Crown Copyright When, in 1938, as the prospect of war loomed over Europe, Geoffrey de Havilland first suggested the idea of a lightweight twin-engine bomber to the U.K. Air Ministry he was met with little enthusiasm. Undeterred, he decided that his company would build it anyway. And, if the new machine was built from wood, he knew he would not only be able to get it into production much more quickly than a metal design but would also avoid making any demand on vital supplies of the aluminum required to build every other military aircraft. In top secret, on the grounds of a moated stately home near St. Albans, north of London, his team got to work on a prototype. They were fortunate that despite the Air Ministry’s skepticism their efforts enjoyed determined and far-sighted support from Air Marshal Wilfred Freeman, the man responsible for research, development, and production of new aircraft for the RAF. Impressed as a young pilot in the Royal Flying Corps (the RAF’s immediate successor) by the performance of an earlier de Havilland bomber design, Freeman circumvented the objections of Bomber Command to the notion of an unarmed bomber by ordering 50 of de Havilland’s sleek new Mosquitos to fulfill a separate RAF requirement for high-flying spyplanes. Powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, the Mosquito was capable of flying to Berlin and back with the same 4,000-pound bombload as Boeing’s B-17 Flying Fortress yet flown by a crew of two instead of 10. Following a remarkable flying display laid on for Gen. Hap Arnold, the head of the United States Army Air Corps, in April 1941, he rated it “outstanding” and insisted on taking a set of the blueprints home with him. Three months later, in the same week that it entered frontline service, a Mosquito recorded a top speed of 433 miles per hour at a time when the RAF’s top fighter, the Spitfire Mk V, topped out at 370 miles per hour. Suddenly everyone wanted the Mosquito and because of its unique wood and glue construction, furniture factories, cabinetmakers, and musical instrument manufacturers around Britain were able to put their carpentry-skilled workforces to work helping keep up with demand. After first entering RAF service with a photo-reconnaissance unit in the summer of 1941, the first Mosquito bomber squadron formed a few months later. No. 105 Squadron’s operations remained classified for nearly a year until, in September 1942, after a low-level raid on a Gestapo HQ in Oslo, the Mosquito’s existence was revealed to the public in enthusiastic reports that noted its ability to “outpace the latest Focke-Wulf [Fw 190].” And that was exactly what BOAC needed. A Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190 at its airbase. As of mid-1942, this was the most potent German fighter in large-scale service and a major threat to the RAF. Photo by Weltbild/ullstein bild via Getty Images The first BOAC machine completed the ball-bearing run to Sweden in February 1943. Although not immune to the attentions of the German fighter squadrons that pincered the route, the Mosquitos, their camouflaged wings overpainted top and bottom with their civilian registration in huge letters and the airline’s iconic ‘speedbird’ logo on the nose, at least loaded the odds in favor of the airline pilots. A single Mosquito could carry a load of 1,400 pounds of Swedish ball bearings packed in cases and stowed in the bomb bay, but its speed meant it could complete two or even three runs between Leuchars and Stockholm in a single night. In June of 1943, the airline’s Mosquito fleet completed 30 round trips to help chip away at Britain’s ball-bearing deficit, but their greater contribution was made through a single, game-changing flight at the end of the month. Henry Waring and Ville Siberg had been kicking their heels in St. Andrews, on Scotland’s east coast, for nearly a week. Waring, a representative of the British Iron and Steel Corps, and his colleague, who ran SKF’s Luton factory, knew valuable time was being wasted. Ball bearings from neutral Sweden were supplied on a first-come, first-served basis and it was understood in London that the Germans, after Allied bombing of their own ball-bearing factories, were on the verge of placing a large order. Twice Waring phoned London urging action but was told that long, hot summer days and a complete lack of cloud cover meant attempting the flight in the waiting Lockheed 14 would be suicide. A BOAC Mosquito FB.VI G-AGGD prepares to land. Crown Copyright Waring was sunbathing by the swimming pool when, on June 24, an RAF driver pulled up at the hotel. Still in his swimming trunks, Waring was taken to Leuchars and informed that he and Siberg would be traveling to Sweden that night in a pair of hastily adapted BOAC Mosquitos. Each fortified by a stiff whisky before departure, the two businessmen reached Bromma just hours before the German negotiating team to secure SKF’s ball bearings for the Allies, and, as well as catering for British requirements, also deliberately placed orders for gauges they believed were in short supply in the Reich. Their safe delivery was recorded on the freight manifest as “one package Waring, one package Siberg.” Geoffrey de Havilland once wrote that “if the size is right, the aeroplane becomes very versatile.” But the Mosquito had a sort of Goldilocks quality to it. It could do anything. Doctrine has it that there are four roles of air power: control of the air; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; attack; and mobility. Broadly speaking, an air force requires fighters, spyplanes, bombers, and transport aircraft to perform these tasks, each usually requiring very different characteristics in an airframe. Prior to 1943, though, the Mosquito had already made its mark as an exceptional example of the first three. A BOAC Mosquito pilot climbing aboard an FB.VI. Note the four sealed 20mm cannon gun ports in the nose. Crown Copyright In going on to drop a total of nearly 27,000 tons of bombs on the enemy, Mosquitos suffered fewer losses per thousand sorties than any other aircraft in Bomber Command. And so accurate were they that, after the campaign to destroy V-1 flying-bomb launch sites in the autumn of 1942, records showed that Mosquito crews required less than a quarter of the tonnage of bombs to destroy each target than the next most effective bomber. There were single nights on either side of D-Day when Mosquito fighter-bombers would destroy nearly a thousand separate pieces of German motor transport. As heavily armed eight-gun fighters — especially as radar-equipped night-fighters — Mosquitos shot down over 800 enemy aircraft. Such was the fear that they induced within the Luftwaffe in the latter stages of the war as they loitered around German airfields after dark, ready to pounce on anything coming in or out, that the term Moskitopanik was coined. Flying photo-reconnaissance missions, Mosquitos crisscrossed Europe with near impunity gathering critical photographic intelligence that, among other things, helped delay the threat from Hitler’s V-2 ballistic missile. In assuming the mantle of airliner/transport for BOAC between Leuchars and Stockholm, the Mosquito became perhaps the only machine in history to successfully combine all four of these essential roles. BOAC crew with an RAF Flying Control officer at RAF Leuchars before departing for Stockholm. Crown Copyright In the six months that followed Waring and Viberg’s flight, Mosquitos flew another 129 round trips to Sweden and hauled back over 100 tons of ball bearings. But it was the human cargoes they carried to and from Scandinavia that really distinguished the British and Norwegian civilian pilots and radio operators employed by BOAC. As well as maintaining the flow of intelligence and personnel to and from Sweden, and by extension, Denmark, they were also responsible for repatriating downed Allied aircrews, many of whom had been spirited out of Denmark to Sweden by local resistance groups. A little before 6:30 a.m. at Bromma Airport on October 6, 1943, the crew of BOAC Mosquito FB.VI G-AGGG installed Niels Bohr in the bomb bay and briefed him on how to use the intercom and oxygen system. They said they would tell him when he was required to switch it on. He was given flares and a parachute in case they had to abandon the aircraft, then sealed into the claustrophobically compact space for the duration of the two-and-a-half-hour flight. Climbing west through 15,000 feet towards the thin air of what mountaineers call the death zone near 25,000 feet, the BOAC crew was confident that, behind them, Bohr would follow his instructions. Unknown to them, the leather flying helmet that contained his intercom didn’t fit easily over the scientist’s large head, so he couldn’t hear them. Nor did Bohr, who could be remarkably unworldly, properly understand how to use the oxygen. A BOAC Mosquito lines up for takeoff from RAF Leuchars in Scotland. Crown Copyright When the radio operator asked how he was getting on there was no answer from the bomb bay. He feared that Bohr had passed out through oxygen starvation. But until G-AGGG had swept through the jaws of the German air defenses ranged to the north and south, they had to stay high. Two and half hours after taking off from Bromma, after completing the final leg of the journey low over the North Sea, the Mosquito FB.VI landed at RAF Leuchars and taxied towards an anxious crowd waiting by the terminal. Where, to their great relief, the Great Dane, weak but alive, was liberated from the belly of the aircraft. The following month Bohr sailed for America, arriving at Los Alamos to join the Manhattan Project in the new year. Here, as historian Alex Wellerstein writes, Bohr’s contribution to building the first functional nuclear devices was highly significant, although subsequently underplayed. Capt. Gilbert Rae, a BOAC Mosquito pilot, at the controls of his aircraft. Rae was killed when his Mosquito crashed into the North Sea in 1944. Photo by The Print Collector/Getty Images Meanwhile, as a fighter, bomber, and spyplane, de Havilland’s ‘Wooden Wonder’ enjoyed a near-legendary reputation and established itself as something of a bête noire to Hermann Göring, commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe. The string of daring low-level Mosquito raids against pinpoint targets across occupied Europe that captured the imagination of the public inspired the 1964 film 633 Squadron, which in turn provided inspiration for the X-Wing’s trench-run attack against the Death Star in Star Wars. But, now almost forgotten, BOAC’s small fleet of unarmed couriers, more Millennium Falcon than X-Wing, made a crucial contribution of their own, flying vital personnel, cargo, and intelligence to and from Sweden. Completing their own Kessel Run over 520 times before the war’s end — on one occasion in early 1944, three times in a single night — the unarmed speedsters suffered losses due to bad weather and bad luck, but not one, despite coming under attack, was ever believed to have been lost to the Luftwaffe. Perhaps, though, that brief, seemingly insignificant scene in Oppenheimer will be as close as they ever get to movie stardom of their own.

I just think we might tend always to try to specialise and think that specialisation is the highest possible good.To turn this to software, it was powerful for Android and iOS to use languages for which a lot of developer talent existed already and to pay attention to the ease of development more than ultimate performance. Nokia used an active-objects based version of C++ which used little memory and could get good performance out of the tiny ARM chips of the day but was very hard to program for.

See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;sections&#x2F;health-shots&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;6412565....For me one of the most compelling data points wasn&#x27;t even a parenting reference. It was https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Amer.... First published in the mid-1990s, the chapters on the children of millionaires found that the more support millionaires gave to their children, the worse that those children turned out. Armed with that theory, I&#x27;ve always doubted the wisdom of extreme helicopter parenting that has become popular since. reply swalling 2 hours agoparentOne important thing that the NPR story completely glosses over is the component of race and class that permeates this issue. It’s not an accident that the prototypical mom of the “free range kid” movement is white and lives in a relatively wealthy neighborhood like the one mentioned in the story.Poor black and brown women are disproportionately targeted by child welfare authorities starting literally from birth. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7372952&#x2F; This makes it particularly important that we actually change the laws around what constitutes neglect or endangerment, not just create a culture shift. reply scaramanga 3 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d love to read the papers cited there without having to buy that book.I wonder if what is defined as \"support\" is actually, meddling, undermining, and pressurzing children into fulfilling the parents needs. reply btilly 3 hours agorootparentThe book wasn&#x27;t a compilation of independent research papers. It was produced out of a compilation of interviews done to better understand millionaires.Support was defined by the wealthy parent providing financial support, whether through a stipend, gifts, or whatever. It turned out that, despite the best of intentions, such support almost inevitably wound up with destructive emotional dynamics. reply londons_explore 1 hour agorootparentBut presumably it is also possible that some children were smart and successful, so therefore the parents didn&#x27;t feel the need to provide so much support.Whereas others were perhaps struggling with everything so the parents gave much more support.Everyday example: the parents of disabled people dedicate almost everything they&#x27;ve got to help their children, and often end up poor and with a poor quality of life themselves as a result. reply blitzar 1 hour agorootparentprev> It turned out that, despite the best of intentions, such support almost inevitably wound up with destructive emotional dynamicsSee the list of \"self made\" billionaires who started with a small loan of a couple 100 mil from their parents for examples. reply KptMarchewa 2 hours agorootparentprev\"Financial\" was the key missing word. reply sarkhan 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, it comes a lot of from the good stuff that involved parenting does.In other words, even taking kids to school in a car instead them walking (or at least on the bike, but their own feet still involved, therefore they are themselves 100% in control in going to school) is the support that is not the in the list of \"support\" but will be in the long run. I should mention, I do recognize the time constraints of current society. reply WalterBright 3 hours agorootparentprev> without having to buy that bookYou can get the book for $2.74:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Millionaire-Next-Door-Surprising-Amer...Unless there is some other reason you don&#x27;t want to buy it? reply okwhateverdude 1 hour agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;1996-the-millionaire-next-doorHere you go. reply yieldcrv 2 hours agoparentprevEpigenetics suggests that unnecessary stressors in the current generation reduce biological fitness, which competes with struggle for the sake of struggle when its not necessaryhope someone finds the happy medium of allowing growth without unnecessary stress reply RandomLensman 1 hour agorootparentAs opposed to necessary stressors in previous generations (hot and cold wars)? If not all stressors are bad, which ones are good? reply davidkuennen 1 hour agoprevWhen I was little (20 years ago), I left the house in the morning and came back in the evening. My parents didn&#x27;t really care what I did. It was the same for all the children in our small village.We played in the forest, created tree homes, tunnels and much more. It was an incredible time which I&#x27;m certain helped me a lot in my development.Granted, I was growing up on a farm in Germany. There wasn&#x27;t much traffic or other \"dangers\". reply adrianN 4 hours agoprevHow are children in car-centric societies supposed to be independent when they need adults to drive them to places? reply scaramanga 4 hours agoparentYou should read the paper. That&#x27;s basically what it&#x27;s about.eg. car oriented neighbourhoods mean kids don&#x27;t get to play as much, and that&#x27;s a factor which is independent of economic&#x2F;social status.But also other socio-economic factors can lead to similar outcomes (eg. underfunded schools, longer work hours for parents, and the like). reply Tade0 3 hours agoparentprevI see it as a scapegoat. The real reason is this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net&#x2F;img&#x2F;q60&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;assets...According to this poll from 2014, 43% Americans think that the government should require 12-year-olds to play at public parks under supervision.You could create the most walkable neighbourhood in the world and not achieve much in this regard. reply BytesAndGears 2 hours agorootparentI feel like the problem though is that people don’t trust their community, and they don’t trust that the kids will be safe.If the child’s playground is right next to a block of houses and shops with people walking around all day, it is much less likely that the child is taken away. Whether it’s actually safer, I’m not entirely sure, but it definitely feels safer to have your kid playing near a busy pedestrian area, compared to an abandoned playground down a quiet road at 4pm. And the feeling is what matters regardless.And that is a big part, but also just the feeling of trusting your neighbors increases when you live in a walkable place and see your neighbors all the time. [0] That source isn’t maybe the most thorough, but it echoes my experience of moving to a quiet but walkable neighborhood in the Netherlands from the US. People really do trust their neighbors much more here, and I’ve changed in that regard too. Everyone is always offering to help each other out.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC1448008&#x2F; reply CalRobert 4 hours agoparentprevThey aren&#x27;t, sadly. We moved to the Netherlands and seeing kids out on their own is great. It makes me for kids who lack this freedom though. reply Apocryphon 4 hours agoparentprevThey could bike, but how many neighborhoods are safely bikeable? reply riffraff 3 hours agorootparentI grew up in a small town where everybody drove everywhere and bike lane did not exist, but as a kid we grew up biking on the roads or walking around. Our typical soccer pitch was a partly secluded street, and getting the ball stuck under a car was the norm.Now in my home town there are zero kids on the street. Culture has shifted drastically. reply bbarnett 4 hours agorootparentprevEvery one I&#x27;ve ever seen.Most places I&#x27;ve seen, yes in the US, have bike paths, and houses are typically in a separate area from main thoroughfares. Why wouldn&#x27;t a kid bike to a friend&#x27;s house, or a local park? reply Apocryphon 3 hours agorootparentNot all bike paths exist in quiet suburbs. Some exist along busy main roads, which make them dangerous even for adult riders. reply asveikau 3 hours agorootparentI suspect this depends on a North American centric definition of \"busy main road\" and \"bike path\". reply bbarnett 3 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not really a bike path, now is it? It&#x27;s a painted lane on a road.I&#x27;ve never been in a place where I had to take a \"busy main road\" to get around locally. Cross it sometimes, sure, which can be done at a light. This sort of highlights the problem. Over-protectiveness, by examining the worst that can happen, and the worst scenario. reply caconym_ 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve been riding in a big west coast city for the better part of two decades, and I have definitely not been able to rely on dedicated bike paths (or even multimodal \"trails\") to get around. I mostly ride in the road, and often in the car lane rather than a paint-separated bike lane when I judge that the latter is unsafe (can happen for various reasons but mostly conflicts with cars turning right, pulling out, etc.).Despite that, I&#x27;ve avoided bad accidents and generally felt pretty safe, but only because I survived long enough to develop an acute intuition for when drivers are about to do something stupid&#x2F;illegal&#x2F;dangerous. Previous and contemporaneous experience driving a car on the same streets was also very important. I would not trust these streets with my daughter&#x27;s safety on a bike, and I honestly won&#x27;t trust her to read the idiots&#x27; minds until she has some experience doing so from inside a heavy steel cage.Riding within neighborhoods like the one I live in now is a different question, though some people do drive quite fast through here, and the size of the typical modern car makes clearances and sight-lines rather tight. I do see a lot of older kids out on their own walking, often to and from school, which I think is great. reply Apocryphon 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, frankly, perhaps you haven&#x27;t been to that many places. reply winrid 3 hours agorootparentprevI live in a decently nice neighborhood in San Jose. Houses $2-3m. People constantly run the stop signs, they don&#x27;t slow down at all, 30-40mph. I&#x27;ve only lived here one month and I already saw a car hit a pedestrian on a scooter at an intersection (and the guy just drove off).The issue is just don&#x27;t care, it seems. :( reply Geezus_42 3 hours agorootparentprevNever seen a bike path in any neighborhood in the part of the US I live in. I&#x27;m sure they exist somewhere, but they are definitely not common. The are bike paths in downtown areas, but not in the suburbs. reply SkyPuncher 3 hours agoparentprevI had plenty of access to play without driving anywhere.I spent hours and hours playing on my driveway and in my yard with minimal supervision. reply amrocha 3 hours agorootparentI hope you see how sad that statement is. Kids in truly free places ride the train around the entire city by themselves. reply palm-tree 2 hours agorootparentprevWow, a yard AND a driveway?I think the idea here is that children need to have the opportunity to explore the wider world independently, not just a 50 metre circle around their home. reply Broken_Hippo 1 hour agorootparentprevPlaying in your yard isn&#x27;t really \"minimal supervision\". You probably just didn&#x27;t know how often your parents checked on you. And you would have known that your parent could just look outside and see you.As a 8 or 9-year-old, could you go to a friends house, to the store, or to school without parental supervision?Did you have safe bike lanes to do this? Was there safe public transportation? Sidewalks on busier streets? Safe crosswalks where the cars are supposed to stop by law - and are those laws enforced heavily to keep you safe? Could you play independently outside of your yard? reply wincy 1 hour agorootparentI live in the USA and we picked our neighborhood specifically because of these things.My kid has been going to her friend’s houses by herself since she was 5. She goes down the block (sometimes a couple of blocks! Friends of friends) to her friend’s houses. I feel like we changed the culture in the neighborhood. Kids come out and go to our house and other houses all the time. It’s a good, safe neighborhood.Of course it just takes a few people to screw this up. Some busybody lady who felt the need to tell us she was a foster mom (okay? Maybe trying to signal what a moral person and upstanding person she was?) called CPS on us saying we were “neglecting” our child which meant a visit to verify we were not abandoning our child on the street. She later lost her job and had to move away, let me tell you I was very sad to hear it. To avoid such spurious accusations, we got our daughter an Apple Watch with cellular service, which we generally use to call her when it gets dark out.She’s eight now, and went to Walmart by herself earlier this year several times on her bike to buy a few things. I was very proud of her!This is extremely important to us that she be able to have this autonomy. It’s definitely not the default, though. There are a half dozen or more kids that regularly dip in and out of our house. It’s sad that some parents absolutely don’t allow their children out of their sight. There are kids just next door my daughter basically never sees because they aren’t allowed to leave their houses, despite being the same age as my kid. reply ilrwbwrkhv 3 hours agoprevParents shuffling around kids from activity to activity in their minivans is the bane of present day kids. The problem is that cities are so car centric. A good way of alleviating some of it is to do at least 3 hours of independent self play a day. reply baron816 4 hours agoprevThe Coddling of the American Mind is a good book on this topic https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thecoddling.com&#x2F;. reply scaramanga 3 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s on a different topic. ie.

Photograph: Clynt Garnham Transportation/Alamy The Observer Rail industry ‘It’s the same daily misery’: Germany’s terrible trains are no joke for a nation built on efficiency Deutsche Bahn’s once-admired service has descended into chaos. Whether decades of poor investment or the company’s unusual structure is to blame, it’s a huge headache for a coalition trying to meet climate goals Joanna Partridge Cologne Sat 14 Oct 2023 13.00 BST T he sleek high-speed train is 10 minutes behind schedule when it slides into Cologne’s main station before continuing its journey north to Dortmund. The delay is now such a common occurrence that the train manager does not even both to mention it to disembarking passengers. In late afternoon on an unremarkable weekday in this western German city, holidaymakers are hauling suitcases through the station, workers are commuting home, and the late arrival of Deutsche Bahn’s IC 118 from Innsbruck is no surprise. It does cause annoyance, though: a glance at the departures and arrivals board prompts one middle-aged man carrying a backpack to swear loudly as he enters the station. It’s hard to blame him: on the afternoon the Observer visited, the arrivals board showed that eight out of the next nine trains due into Cologne were behind schedule. The degree of lateness ranged from minutes to several hours, and a lengthy queue had formed at the entrance hall’s information desk. “The situation has severely deteriorated in recent years,” said Detlef Neuss, chair of the passenger lobby group Pro Bahn, standing outside Cologne’s main station, in the shadow of the city’s gothic cathedral with its distinctive twin spires. Detlef Neuss, chairman of passenger lobby group Pro Bahn. Photograph: Joanna Partridge “They tried to keep the trains running on time, so some building projects were postponed,” Neuss continues. “That was a big mistake, and the rail network has been run even further into the ground.” For travellers in the UK, this may sound familiar. Earlier this month, after weeks of speculation over the future of Britain’s planned HS2 high-speed rail link from Birmingham to Manchester, the prime minister finally announced that the northern leg was to be scrapped. But the UK’s train passengers are far from the only ones in Europe facing rail problems. Germany’s railways, once a source of national pride, have become something of an embarrassment in a country with a reputation for efficiency and engineering prowess. And this comes amid a time of economic anxiety, with Europe’s largest economy stagnating amid weaker global growth. Deutsche Bahn has been described as being in “permanent crisis” by Germany’s national audit office, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is usually known for its sober language. In an excoriating special report published earlier this year, the public audit body did not mince its words as it sounded the alarm, warning that the company responsible for running the national rail network, its stations and signals, along with many long-distance and local trains, risked becoming a “bottomless pit” for taxpayer money. It said debts at the company – which is wholly owned by Germany’s federal government – were growing at the rate of more than €5m (£4.3m) a day, and its total debt was now more than €30bn. Passengers on the concourse at Cologne station check a departure board showing delays of several hours. Photograph: Joanna Partridge Worsening reliability, including delays, cancellations and lengthy closures of large sections of track during upgrade work, have become a popular topic of conversation across Germany. Meanwhile passengers in neighbouring Austria are complaining about the knock-on effect of hold-ups across the border, and Switzerland’s famously punctual railways have stopped waiting for the arrival of connections from Germany. It was not always thus. Teacher Max Winter, 43, did not think twice about accepting a job at a school in the city of Wolfsburg, despite it being more than 140 miles from his home in Berlin, because Wolfsburg was on the line between the capital and Hanover, and there were regular rail services. “I didn’t consider it a big distance,” he says. “At the start I never thought about it, or even considered moving to Wolfsburg.” When he began his daily commute in January 2016, he had few problems with the hour-long journey on a high-speed intercity train, bookended by cycle rides. The trip would have taken three times as long by car. “In the past few years it has really changed, and I can’t defend Deutsche Bahn any more,” he says. Despite paying some €4,400 for an annual season ticket, in recent months Winter has had to put up with a weeks-long closure of the track between Wolfsburg and Berlin for upgrades, coupled with delays, cancelled trains and lack of staff. At one point, the father-of-one even had to temporarily rent a room in Wolfsburg to ensure he could make it to work. They run through a catalogue of excuses. Today it was damaged signal boxes, tomorrow defective train doors. Everyone on the platform says, oh, not again Birgit Schmitt-Janssen, commuter Back in western Germany Birgit Schmitt-Janssen, 61, also feels let down. “You can 100% count on Deutsche Bahn to be late,” she laughs. “It’s the same daily misery.” She does not have a driving licence, and describes herself as “dependent” on Deutsche Bahn for the daily 13-mile commute from her home in Mönchengladbach to her office in the town of Krefeld. Schmitt-Janssen, who volunteers with passenger group Pro Bahn, says the journey, which she has made for the past nine years, has been unreliable ever since the staffing shortages that followed the pandemic. “I get really annoyed when I’m standing on the platform and it becomes clear there are lots of delays,” says, adding that rail replacement buses could double the length of her commute. “You get the feeling they run through a catalogue of excuses. Today it was damaged signal boxes, tomorrow they’ll say it was defective train doors, and the following day it’ll be an earlier train running late. Everyone on the platform says, ‘oh, not again.’” Frustrated passengers regularly take to social media to share complaints or joke about the most improbable reason they’ve been given for a disrupted service. The extent of Deutsche Bahn’s problems is not just anecdotal. Official figures showed record delays in 2022, when more than a third of long-distance trains ran late, and delays to regional and freight trains became more frequent. Engineering work on Germany’s tracks can mean lines close for weeks. Photograph: Getty Images But things have got worse in recent months: more than 36% of long-distance trains were delayed in August, along with almost 9% of regional trains. This was blamed on the high volume of building work across the rail network – despite the company giving itself the buffer of saying passenger trains are on time if they are less than six minutes late. Germany may be the home of an ever-powerful carmaking lobby and an autobahn which includes some sections free of speed limits, but it is also heavily reliant on its extensive rail network. It connects the country’s major cities – Hamburg to Munich, Frankfurt to Berlin – to each other and to the rest of the continent, although the track network has in fact been shrinking for years. Many believe that decades of chronic underinvestment have now come home to roost, with the railways becoming a symbol of Germany’s creaking infrastructure – alongside motorways and bridges – at a time of economic malaise. The IMF and OECD have warned that the country will be a laggard among the world’s leading economies this year. It also comes as many are reassessing the priorities pursued during the Angela Merkel years, including the country’s energy policy and its dealings with Russia. Deutsche Bahn is in its biggest crisis since its creation almost 30 years ago, in the 1994 “rail reform” that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification. The company, formed from the existing West and East German railways, was freed from previous debts with the idea that it would be able, in time, to become profitable, with the goal of boosting Germany’s GDP and floating on the stock market. Except it did not quite work out that way. Unlike other similarly privatised companies such as Deutsche Telekom and the postal service Deutsche Post, which successfully went public, Deutsche Bahn remains in government hands. Its company structure is unusual in that it has one sole owner, shareholder and financial backer: the German state. Indeed, the German constitution requires the government to retain majority ownership of the national railway infrastructure. Critics have blamed this arrangement for what they see as Deutsche Bahn’s major failings, such as its decision to expand its global operations while ignoring its main objective and responsibility to German taxpayers: the operation of Germany’s rail network. “It is very clear that the company’s core business, rail in Germany, has to be its focus,” says Kay Scheller, the president of Germany’s federal audit office, from his office overlooking the Rhine in Bonn. “We have all the disadvantages of this company structure, without the benefits.” Since 1994, Deutsche Bahn has ballooned into an international transport giant: passengers in 10 European countries ride on buses run by its Arriva subsidiary, which also operates London Overground trains for Transport for London, while its Schenker division handles international air, land and sea freight. The German transport ministry, which has responsibility for Deutsche Bahn, stands accused of years of failure to get a grip on the company’s management and operations, all while stumping up funding. Scheller says: “The German federal government needs to coordinate the company more, and steer it more. That means if things don’t work, it has to intervene.” He adds: “All criticism rolls off the back of Deutsche Bahn’s management, because they don’t have to fear any sanctions or reforms which would fundamentally change the system. However, these are necessary and I’m not confident that the situation will improve otherwise.” Indeed, the company’s most recent financial results, for the first six months of 2023, illustrate a worsening situation: Deutsche Bahn made a net loss of €71m in the first half, compared with a profit of €424m for the same period a year earlier. Transport minister Volker Wissing promised €40bn of additional investment, as part of “the largest refurbishment and modernisation agenda in the history of this country’s railways” As a result, Germany’s current three-way coalition government will not be able to achieve some of its loftier ambitions for rail during this decade, according to the federal audit office. The governing agreement struck by the Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals in late 2021 committed them to doubling the capacity of passenger services by 2030, while setting a target for 25% of freight to be carried by rail by that date, and electrifying more railway lines amid attempts to meet climate goals. Contrary to the view of the country’s audit office, Neuss and passenger representatives believe more investment is the answer to many of Deutsche Bahn’s problems. At a recent rail summit organised by the government and Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s transport minister, Volker Wissing, called it “unacceptable” that rail infrastructure had been “neglected for decades”. Despite a “tight budgetary position”, he promised €40bn of additional investment in the railways to 2027, as part of what he called “the largest refurbishment and modernisation agenda in the history of this country’s railways”. A Deutsche Bahn spokesperson told the Observer that the country’s rail infrastructure had not kept pace with increased passenger and freight traffic, and admitted that the network was “in parts too old, too overloaded and too prone to faults”. The company has vowed to expand the most intensively used stretches of track, while replacing sleepers, track beds, rails, signal boxes and stations. While this plan may be music to the ears of Neuss and passenger groups, who have been calling for significantly more investment, it received a mixed response from the country’s frustrated rail passengers, many of whom took to social media to decry the announcement as “too little too late”. Scheller, the audit office president, also remains unconvinced. “So poor performance leads to even greater investment from the government,” he says. “This strengthens our argument: it won’t work without fundamental reform. Lots of money on its own isn’t a panacea.” Germany’s transport ministry did not respond to the Observer’s repeated requests for comment.

This can only be done by a state.

They measure delay at arrival at the end station. However, many trains have some margins built in during their ride, so they may be delayed en-route but \"catch up\" by the time they reach their end destination; resulting in more favorable numbers.2. Cancelled trains are not counted in the statistics. So ironically, to improve punctuality statistics, it is \"better\" to cancel a train than having it run with a delay.3. Trains are more delayed during peak hours than off-peak or during the weekend, but all trains count equally in these numbers.4. If a (e.g. 5 minute) delay causes you to miss your transfer, you arrive much later at your final destination (e.g. 30 or 60 minutes).5. If you inflate travel times (adding some extra \"margin\"), you can avoid bad statistics but passengers still don&#x27;t get at their destination faster. This has happened in the past.A fairer way to calculate delays would be to take a sample of all passengers and measure how delayed they arrive at their (final) destination.

Intercity rail is about as irritating as flying, delay wise. Getting good with the schedule app adds a lot of agency - I&#x27;ve made lots of spur of the moment connection change decisions (having the 50% off flexible fares card also helps).The rail system has been a bit of a victim of the Deutschlandticket&#x27;s success.

It&#x27;s also building&#x2F;upgrading new train stations in major cities.There is an extensive public transport system with regional trains and also long distance trains. Core technical infrastructure in many places for them is old. Especially computer controlled train operations have to be introduced in many places.Upgrading this takes a decade or more and this process is very expensive and will cause even more delays during the update phase. It will partly get worse, before it gets better.For example the high-speed connection between Hamburg and Berlin (roughly every 30 minutes ICE trains travel in both directions) will be upgraded during the next two years and there will be longer travel times for several months.Upgrading the major train stations is also very difficult, since most of them are in the center of already dense cities. Here in Hamburg one of the important ICE train stations (Altona, where several ICE trains are starting) will be moved to a new place in the city (a few km apart). The train station then will no longer be a terminus (trains now enter&#x2F;leave only in one direction), which will improve travel times.

I remember a train from Stuttgart to Amsterdam, even quite a few years go, the end result was we would be quite close to missing the last trains to final destination in Amsterdam due to mishaps at Frankfurt. We (the Dutchies) got better support from the NS (Dutch railways) than the Germans at all places. We could call a number to get alternative routes, get advice on where to go, what to ask and got notice on what to do when. Eventually we were told to board a train by taking a local train to Frankfurt Flugplatz but first get our tickets transfered so we would get prefered seats. Afterwards we even got all tickets back, including transfers, due to delays and even the transfer tickets back with a few online clicks while the Germans had to fill in all kinds of forms. On the final train the Germans were surprised when the Dutch officers were asking everyone their end destination (stil in Germany) to know if they could delay the transfer trains in the Netherlands so everyone could get home. If you could not a cab would be free of charge.For me that was the day I realised the Dutch trains weren&#x27;t as bad as I thought.edit: I did have a first class ticket but the end line -make sure every one got home- was in general no questions asked. reply Waterluvian 15 hours agoprevYou know that experience where as a company ages and grows, as a product evolves, it becomes harder and harder to do anything? Sure, if you do a great job planning and designing your runway is longer, but the music always slows.This also seems to happen with cities. The bigger and more established, the harder it is, for obvious reasons, to retrofit mass transit and whatnot. Downtowns of large cities always feel kinda hacked together.Does the same happen with a country? The longer a country’s current established governmental system exists, the more it inevitably bogs down? reply usrnm 15 hours agoparent> The longer a country’s current established governmental system exists, the more it inevitably bogs down?Doesn&#x27;t really apply to Germany all that well. reply thatfrenchguy 13 hours agoparentprevHave you seen the subway extensions in Paris? reply bluerooibos 16 hours agoprevThe UK: \"Hold my beer.\"At least Germany has high speed rail.The fact that the Beeching cuts of the 60&#x27;s happened should be a point of national embarrassment - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Beeching_cuts - the country is still suffering the consequences of this \"strategy\". reply laurencerowe 11 hours agoparentDespite the Beeching cuts the UK still has a pretty dense rail system.

The article mentions people blaming service deterioration on Deutsche Bahn being state-owned and without competition. UK should be quite different after Thatcher&#x27;s privatization campaign starting in late 80s (been there in early 90s on a London station heading to the east, totally confused which train to board while being yelled at ^H informed over the speaker about the service provider&#x2F;operator but not much else). reply fredley 15 hours agoparentAt times it can feel like being trapped in a nation of self-saboteurs. reply resolutebat 12 hours agoprev> Germany may be the home of an ever-powerful carmaking lobby and an autobahn which includes some sections free of speed limitsI recently spent a week driving around southern Germany. The freeways around Munich seemed to be in permanent Stau (jam) mode, even off peak on weekdays. Outside cities, on the notionally-unlimited stretches, I could rarely even drive at 130 (the advisory limit) because there was simply so much traffic. reply Febra33 15 hours agoprev> The delay is now such a common occurrence that the train manager does not even both to mention it to disembarking passengers.Do these corporations even have proofreaders? reply kingofpandora 4 hours agoparent> Do these corporations even have proofreaders?It&#x27;s called The Grauniad for a reason! reply Akashic101 16 hours agoprev> When he began his daily commute in January 2016, he had few problems with the hour-long journey on a high-speed intercity train, bookended by cycle rides.

The Germna traffic department has been held by the conservatives (CSU) for years, and ministers like Peter Ramsauer, Alexander Dobrindt, and Andreas Scheuer were more concerned with investing in roads (particularly in Bavaria, their home state) than in rails. Now the ministry is with the liberals (FDP, Volker Wissing), who also seem to be more concerned with defending drivers’ freedom. reply progx 15 hours agoprevNot only our trains! reply orwin 10 hours agoprevI want to give props to Italy and Spain. Highly efficient trains, the rail building is as fast as Switzerland and France, and cost way less (Italy used to have cost issues but it seems fixed now). I think they will have the 2nd and 3rd best railroad network in a decade if they keep up (behind Switzerland, and maybe ahead if Lausanne hub keep getting slowed down) (i&#x27;m forgetting about Benelux, let&#x27;s say the 3rd and 4th, and let&#x27;s not count countries like Luxembourg or smaller). reply whoisstan 14 hours agoprevmay I add to the list: - Covid Vaccination Rollout - Government plane routinely breaking - Berlin Airport Construction - Military Weapon Procurement - last but not least, German National team reply notrlyskeptik 16 hours agoprev [–] Look at the management boards of German transport and telco companies in the past twenty+ years.
