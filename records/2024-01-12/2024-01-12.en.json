    "originBody": "Blog The Internet Is Full of AI Dogshit The Internet is now a series of machines talking to machines 2:39 PM EST on November 28, 2023 Image source: System Shock, Nightdive By Gita Jackson Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share on Email 24Comments Join the Discussion The Internet used to be so simple to use that people collectively coined the term “let me Google that for you” to make fun of people who had the audacity of asking other people questions online. In the future I fear that people will have no other choice but to ask people for information from the Internet, because right now it’s all full of AI dogshit. In September of this year, Google users discovered that the search engine was incorrectly telling people that eggs can melt. Why? Because instead of surfacing websites, Google now grabs snapshots of pages in a drop down menu, allowing users to read search results without clicking on anything. This practice often grabs incorrect information, like an AI-generated answer from Quora that insisted that eggs can melt when they definitely cannot. In yet another example of the increasing uselessness of Google search: Literally today I was able to recreate comic artist Mattie Lubchanskey’s Google search for sinus inflammation that returned results for having an inflamed penis. Yesterday, an unhinged maniac on Twitter claimed to have performed an Internet traffic “heist.” How did he do this? He looked at the site index for the website he wanted to beat in Google search results, exported the article URLS, and then used AI to quickly write articles based on them. In the Twitter thread about this, he described manually editing the titles for these web pages as “optional.” We pulled off an SEO heist that stole 3.6M total traffic from a competitor. We got 489,509 traffic in October alone. Here's how we did it: pic.twitter.com/sTJ7xbRjrT — Jake Ward (@jakezward) November 24, 2023 Also yesterday, the once venerable outlet Sports Illustrated was caught with its pants down. According to a story from Futurism, it appears that multiple different articles on the site were not only written by AI, but claimed to be authored by people who were also completely made up. When Futurism reached out for comment, this content was deleted. Sports Illustrated later released a statement saying that the articles were authored by a third party, were not AI generated, and that the writers were writing under pseudonyms. This does not explain why the articles were removed after press reached out for comment. Nor does it explain why Sports Illustrated publicly stated they would be using AI to generate content for them in an article in the Wall Street Journal from February of this year. Today, an article was published alleging that Sports Illustrated published AI-generated articles. According to our initial investigation, this is not accurate. The articles in question were product reviews and were licensed content from an external, third-party company, AdVon… — Sports Illustrated (@SInow) November 27, 2023 The internet has been broken in a fundamental way. It is no longer a repository of people communicating with people; increasingly, it is just a series of machines communicating with machines. The once ubiquitous phrase “let me Google that for you” is now meaningless. You are as likely to return incorrect information as you are complete fabrications, and the people who put this content on the Internet do not care. The people who hold the purse strings for Sports Illustrated are more interested in gaming Google search results and the resultant ad revenue from that practice than actually serving their readers. If that means the rest of us get information about inflamed penises when we’re trying to know how long sinus inflammation is supposed to last, well, I guess we’re shit out of luck.

    "title": "Concerns Raised over Microsoft's New Outlook: Data Collection and Targeted Advertising",
    "originLink": "https://proton.me/blog/outlook-is-microsofts-new-data-collection-service",
    "originBody": "Privacy news(new window) Outlook is Microsoft’s new data collection service Edward Komenda(new window) Share this page Published on January 5, 2024 With Microsoft’s rollout of the new Outlook for Windows(new window), it appears the company has transformed its email app into a surveillance(new window) tool for targeted advertising. Everyone talks about the privacy-washing(new window) campaigns of Google and Apple as they mine your online data to generate advertising revenue. But now it looks like Outlook is no longer simply an email service(new window); it’s a data collection mechanism for Microsoft’s 772 external partners and an ad delivery system for Microsoft itself. Here’s how and why. Microsoft shares your data with 772 third parties Some European users who download the new Outlook for Windows will encounter a modal with a troubling disclosure about how Microsoft and several hundred third parties process their data: The window informs users that Microsoft and those 772 third parties use their data for a number of purposes, including to: Store and/or access information on the user’s device Develop and improve products Personalize ads and content Measure ads and content Derive audience insights Obtain precise geolocation data Identify users through device scanning This latest version of Outlook confirms that more of Big Tech’s profit margins are becoming ever more dependent on the collection of your personal data. Outlook also prompts you to choose how ads look on your screen, making it clear that advertising is a key part of the deal. Mac users logged into the new Outlook will even encounter ads that appear as inbox messages. Some ads are for Microsoft applications while others come from third-parties selling products. Microsoft’s “Advertising Partners” Thanks to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, Europeans are at least informed that a small village of third parties will be able to look at their data. Americans, thanks to their government’s refusal to pass privacy legislation, are never even informed this is happening. In Outlook settings, UK users can explore a “List of Advertising Partners,” which shows the disturbing number of ad companies working with Microsoft. These third-party companies – called partners – carry names such as “ADMAX” and “ADSOCY.” This is unavailable in the settings for users in the US and Switzerland. To some extent, the new Outlook lets you choose how your data is used, but it’s not as simple as clicking a single toggle. “Depending on the type of data they collect, use, and process and other factors including privacy by design, certain partners rely on your consent while others require you to opt-out,” reads the preferences page for users in the UK. “Click on each advertising company listed below to view their privacy policy and exercise your choices.” Not every partner has the same rules. Users can read each individual privacy policy before deciding, but reading is not required. Such policies are usually long, rambling, and notoriously difficult to understand(new window). But for many companies, that’s the idea(new window). Such policies are intentionally written this way to give companies the maximum freedom to do what they want with your data. That often means selling your personal details to third-party advertisers and data brokers while making it difficult for you to opt out. With the new Outlook, Microsoft forces users to enter maze-like privacy statements to seize back some control of their data. Of course, Microsoft knows that almost no one reads privacy policies(new window). If everyone understood those policies, revenue would be jeopardized. New Outlook steals your email password Microsoft’s integration of Outlook with cloud services has raised privacy alarm bells(new window). When you sync third-party email accounts from services like Yahoo or Gmail(new window) with the new Outlook, you risk granting Microsoft access(new window) to the IMAP(new window) and SMTP(new window) credentials, emails, contacts, and events associated with those accounts, according to the German IT blog Heise Online(new window). “Although Microsoft explains that it is possible to switch back to the previous apps at any time, the data will already be stored by the company,” Heise reported. “This allows Microsoft to read the emails.” You can’t use the new Outlook without syncing all this information with Microsoft Cloud — there is only the option to cancel, according to the developers’ forum XDA(new window). It is also configured to send login details – including usernames and passwords – directly to Microsoft servers. Although this transfer is secured with Transport Layer Security (TLS), according to Heise Online, your IMAP and SMTP username and password are transmitted to Microsoft in plain text. XDA(new window) was able to show their test credentials for a third-party email service provider on Microsoft’s servers. Microsoft is enabling itself to access your email account at any time without your knowledge, allowing it to scan and analyze your emails — and share them with third parties. To users unaware of the privacy implications, using the new Outlook may seem harmless. But what it could mean is welcoming Microsoft into your data vault and giving them complete freedom to potentially use it however they want. Professor Ulrich Kelber, the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, expressed concern about the data capabilities of the new Outlook. He announced on Mastodon(new window) his intention to request a report from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, which is responsible for ensuring companies like Microsoft uphold data protection and privacy standards. Microsoft has not issued a public response to criticisms about its latest data grab. But the software giant has been upfront about its push to use targeted advertising to reach new revenue heights. In 2021, Microsoft Advertising earned $10 billion. But Microsoft wants to double that total(new window). What kind of data does Microsoft collect? Per its advertising policy, Microsoft does not use personal data from emails, chats, or documents to target ads. But the ads that pop up may be selected based on other data that gave the company insight about you – such as “your interests and favorites, your location, your transactions, how you use our products, your search queries, or the content you view(new window).” A deeper dive into Microsoft’s privacy policy shows what personal data it may extract(new window): Name and contact data Passwords Demographic data Payment data Subscription and licensing data Search queries Device and usage data Error reports and performance data Voice data Text, inking, and typing data Images Location data Content Feedback and ratings Traffic data The policy offers a glimpse of where your data might end up(new window): Service providers User-directed entities Payment processing providers Third parties that perform online advertising services for Microsoft Microsoft steers toward data dollars When Google rolled out a privacy policy expanding its powers to collect data(new window), the company drew criticisms from regulators and rivals, including Microsoft, which took out full-page newspaper ads(new window) telling Google users that Google did not respect their privacy. A short time later, however, Microsoft unveiled a privacy policy(new window) allowing it to use personal information to sell targeted advertising, moving aggressively in a direction it once decried. Microsoft has since made significant moves toward surveillance revenue, following in the footsteps of Google, Facebook, and, most recently, Apple(new window). Like other Big Tech companies, Microsoft recognized a chance to generate large revenue streams by collecting and analyzing user data. This data-centric mindset has been part of a larger trend of established companies vying for a slice of the surveillance cash pie(new window). The appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO in 2014 marked a turning point for Microsoft, which faced scrutiny that same year after admitting to reading emails from a journalist’s Hotmail account(new window), forcing the company to tighten its privacy policy(new window). Within three months of taking the job, Nadella released a study from a market intelligence firm that concluded “companies taking advantage of their data have the potential to raise an additional $1.6 trillion in revenues over companies that don’t,” wrote author Shoshana Zuboff in her book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism(new window). Key developments that followed included the Bing search engine and the digital assistant Cortana, both designed to capture and analyze user data. The release of Windows 10 in 2015 further underscored Microsoft’s commitment to this new direction. Scrutiny from the privacy community was swift. Windows 10 “is currently a privacy morass in dire need of reform,” wrote software engineer David Auerbach in Slate(new window), describing how the new operating system, “gives itself the right to pass loads of your data to Microsoft’s servers, use your bandwidth for Microsoft’s own purposes, and profile your Windows usage.” Microsoft’s pivot toward advertising continued with its 2021 purchase of Xandr(new window), but then it decided that it wanted to capitalize on the captive user base its walled garden created and shifted its focus to show first-party ads in its services(new window). Given this direction, Outlook’s new form makes a certain sort of sense. In a 2022 interview with Business Insider(new window), Rob Wilk, Microsoft’s head of advertising, talked of opportunities with properties like Xbox, which includes a console business as well as logged-in accounts – “just one of the areas we’re going to play in,” he said. “Imagine a world, not too far off, where all of these pieces are stitched together to make a cleaner, clearer offering for our advertisers,” Wilk said. “And, don’t forget, we’ve also got browsing information and data across gaming and the Microsoft Windows business with billions of users – this gives us a unique advantage to understand intent.” Wilk dubbed Microsoft’s advertising push a “newfound religion(new window).” Surveillance in the name of profit Microsoft claims that collecting your data is “to provide you rich, interactive experiences.(new window)” Yet in the realm of Big Tech, advertising and ad revenue have become ends in themselves, justifying a business model based on the surveillance of your private data in the name of profit. With this rollout of the new Outlook as a data collection and ad delivery service, Microsoft has revealed itself to be no different than the Googles and Metas of the world. For those companies to make privacy the default would mean losing the revenue they have become addicted to. There are other business models out there deployed by companies that focus first and foremost on online security and privacy. Proton is one of them. Switch to real privacy Proton uses end-to-end encryption to protect your emails, calendar, files stored in the cloud, passwords and login credentials, and your internet connection(new window). Our security architecture is designed to keep your data invisible even to us, as our business model gives you more privacy, not less. Proton provides free and open-source technology to expand access to privacy, security and freedom online. But you can always upgrade to paid plans to access extra features, allowing you to pay with money rather than sensitive data. And Proton makes it easy to switch to our platform. In a few easy steps, you can migrate to an email service you can trust. We believe in building an internet that works for people and not just for profit. The privacy washing companies like Microsoft and Google routinely perform in the name of revenue is just one more obstacle to a better internet where privacy is the default.

    "originLink": "https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/11/24034705/discord-layoffs-17-percent-employees",
    "originBody": "Gaming/ Tech Discord is laying off 17 percent of employees Discord is laying off 17 percent of employees / In an internal memo, CEO Jason Citron said the company grew headcount too quickly over the past few years. By Alex Heath, a deputy editor and author of the Command Line newsletter. He’s covered the tech industry for over a decade at The Information and other outlets. Jan 11, 2024, 6:32 PM UTC| Share this story Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Discord is laying off 17 percent of its staff, a move that CEO Jason Citron said is meant to “sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization.” The cuts were announced today to employees in an all-hands meeting and internal memo I’ve obtained. They’ll impact 170 people across various departments. Based on Citron’s message to employees and my understanding of the business, Discord isn’t in dire financial straits, though it has yet to become profitable and is still trying to revive user growth after a surge during the pandemic. In his memo to employees, which you can read in full below, Citron said Discord grew its headcount too fast over the last few years — an admission that has become quite common among tech CEOs as of late. “We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020,” Citron wrote. “As a result, we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated.” Command Line / A newsletter from Alex Heath about the tech industry’s inside conversation.

These cuts are Discord’s largest to date after the messaging app laid off 4 percent of staff last August. They add to the layoffs that continue to sweep across the tech industry, including deep cuts at Google and Amazon just this week. Discord has raised a total of about $1 billion in funding. It has more than $700 million in cash on its balance sheet and the goal to become profitable this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company has been contemplating going public since it turned down a $12 billion acquisition offer from Microsoft in 2021, though I’m told it’s nowhere near close to doing so. Here’s Citron’s full memo to employees announcing the layoffs: Hi @everyone, I want to follow up on what we just covered at our all-company meeting and share some context. Today we are making the unfortunate and difficult decision to reduce the size of Discord’s workforce by 17%. This means we are saying goodbye to 170 of our talented colleagues. This is a decision we did not take lightly, but it is one that we have conviction in to better serve our users, our business and our mission over the long term. Where we are and how we got here Our company has changed and grown significantly over the past few years. We should all be really proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish together to serve the millions of people who turn to Discord every day to spend time with their friends. At the same time, we have to face some hard truths. We grew quickly and expanded our workforce even faster, increasing by 5x since 2020. As a result, we took on more projects and became less efficient in how we operated. Today, we are increasingly clear on the need to sharpen our focus and improve the way we work together to bring more agility to our organization. This is what largely drove the decision to reduce the size of our workforce. While difficult, I am confident this will put us in the best position to continue building a strong and profitable business that delivers amazing products for our users and supports our mission for years to come. What happens next I’m sure all of you are anxious to know what this means for each of you. - By 10:30 a.m. PT, everyone will receive an email. In your email, you will learn whether or not your employment has been impacted by this reduction-in-force - Leadership will hold a meeting with departing team members at 11:00 a.m. PT to discuss next steps - For all remaining employees, we will come back together this afternoon at 1:00 p.m. PT to talk about what’s next How we’re taking care of our colleagues It is incredibly important to me that we support departing team members through this difficult time and provide them with a sizable runway as they transition into future employment. To that end, we are offering them: - Five months of salary (plus an additional week for every full year at Discord) - Five months of benefit continuation - Three months of outplacement services - Equity vesting of awards scheduled to vest on Feb. 1, 2024 - Continued access to Modern Health through the end of 2024, and more I’ll end by sharing deep appreciation and gratitude for those leaving us. Discord is better because of your contributions and the passion you brought to delivering for our users, our company, and each other. Thank you for everything. It’s incredibly difficult to say goodbye to respected peers, many of whom have become friends. I’m hopeful that working on and with our product has reinforced that these bonds can be sustained and even strengthened beyond the “walls” of any one place.

    "title": "Richard Feynman: Discovering the Joy of Physics and Pursuing Curiosity (1985)",
    "originLink": "https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kilcup.1/262/feynman.html",
    "originBody": "From ``Surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman'', by Richard Feynman, Copyright 1985, pg. 157-158. Dr. Feynman was a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who, among other things, worked on the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, NM. He died in 1988. Then I had another thought: Physics disgusts me a little bit now, but I used to enjoy doing physics. Why did I enjoy it? I used to play with it. I used to do whatever I felt like doing - it didn't have to do with whether it was important for the development of nuclear physics, but whether it was interesting and amusing for me to play with. When I was in high school, I'd see water running out of a faucet growing narrower, and wonder if I could figure out what determines that curve. I found it was rather easy to do. I didn't have to do it; it wasn't important for the future of science; somebody else had already done it. That didn't make any difference. I'd invent things and play with things for my own entertainment. So I got this new attitude. Now that I am burned out and I'll never accomplish anything, I've got this nice position at the university teaching classes which I rather enjoy, and just like I read the Arabian Nights for pleasure, I'm going to play with physics, whenever I want to, without worrying about any importance whatsoever. Within a week I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling. I had nothing to do, so I start to figure out the motion of the rotating plate. I discover that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast as the wobble rate - two to one [Note: Feynman mis-remembers here---the factor of 2 is the other way]. It came out of a complicated equation! Then I thought, ``Is there some way I can see in a more fundamental way, by looking at the forces or the dynamics, why it's two to one?'' I don't remember how I did it, but I ultimately worked out what the motion of the mass particles is, and how all the accelerations balance to make it come out two to one. I still remember going to Hans Bethe and saying, ``Hey, Hans! I noticed something interesting. Here the plate goes around so, and the reason it's two to one is ...'' and I showed him the accelerations. He says, ``Feynman, that's pretty interesting, but what's the importance of it? Why are you doing it?'' ``Hah!'' I say. ``There's no importance whatsoever. I'm just doing it for the fun of it.'' His reaction didn't discourage me; I had made up my mind I was going to enjoy physics and do whatever I liked. I went on to work out equations of wobbles. Then I thought about how electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there's the Dirac Equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it (it was a very short time) I was ``playing'' - working, really - with the same old problem that I loved so much, that I had stopped working on when I went to Los Alamos: my thesis-type problems; all those old-fashioned, wonderful things. It was effortless. It was easy to play with these things. It was like uncorking a bottle: Everything flowed out effortlessly. I almost tried to resist it! There was no importance to what I was doing, but ultimately there was. The diagrams and the whole business that I got the Nobel Prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate.",

    "originBody": "Networking Cloud switching just got easier: Removing data transfer fees when moving off Google Cloud January 11, 2024 Amit Zavery GM/VP, Head of Platform, Google Cloud Join us at Google Cloud Next Early bird pricing available now through Jan 31st. Register At Google Cloud, we work to support a thriving cloud ecosystem that is open, secure, and interoperable. When customers’ business needs evolve, the cloud should be flexible enough to accommodate those changes. Starting today, Google Cloud customers who wish to stop using Google Cloud and migrate their data to another cloud provider and/or on premises, can take advantage of free network data transfer to migrate their data out of Google Cloud. This applies to all customers globally. You can learn more here. Eliminating data transfer fees for switching cloud providers will make it easier for customers to change their cloud provider; however, it does not solve the fundamental issue that prevents many customers from working with their preferred cloud provider in the first place: restrictive and unfair licensing practices. Certain legacy providers leverage their on-premises software monopolies to create cloud monopolies, using restrictive licensing practices that lock in customers and warp competition. The complex web of licensing restrictions includes picking and choosing who their customers can work with and how; charging 5x the cost if customers decide to use certain competitors’ clouds; and limiting interoperability of must-have software with competitors’ cloud infrastructure. These and other restrictions have no technical basis and may impose a 300% cost increase to customers. In contrast, the cost for customers to migrate data out of a cloud provider is minimal. Making it easier for customers to move from one provider to another does little to improve choice if customers remain locked in with restrictive licenses. Customers should choose a cloud provider because it makes sense for their business, not because their legacy provider has locked them in with overly restrictive contracting terms or punitive licensing practices. The promise of the cloud is to allow businesses and governments to seamlessly scale their technology use. Today’s announcement builds on the multiple measures in recent months to provide more value and improve data transfer for large and small organizations running workloads on Google Cloud. We will continue to be vocal in our efforts to advocate on behalf of our cloud customers — many of whom raise concerns about legacy providers’ licensing restrictions directly with us. Much more must be done to end the restrictive licensing practices that are the true barrier to customer choice and competition in the cloud market.

While sources at the company said the layoffs would be significant and as high as 20% — or reductions that would see Pixar’s team of 1,300 dropped to less than 1,000 over the coming months — Pixar says those numbers are too high. Rather, the studio said the number of impacted employees is still being determined due to factors like production schedules and staffing for future greenlit films. The studio stressed the layoffs are not imminent, but will take place later this year as Pixar focuses on making less content. According to insiders, the Pixar layoffs include headcount that was hired for Disney+ — hires Disney pushed on Pixar to produce for its streaming division, which hasn’t yet turned a profit. In Q4, Disney+ added 7 million new subscribers, bringing its total to 150.2 million, including Hotstar, beating analysts’ expectations of 148.15 million subscribers. Disney+’s ad-supported customers also grew by 2 million to reach 5.2 million, as more than 50% of new U.S. customers chose an ad-supported product. A Disney subsidiary, Pixar is best known for films like “Finding Nemo,” “Monsters, Inc.” “WALL-E,” the “Toy Story” franchise, and others. It’s now the latest to be impacted by Disney’s cost-cutting measures, which the company said during its Q4 earnings would increase by an additional $2 billion to reach a target of $7.5 billion, following a decrease in ad revenue from ABC and other TV stations and continued (though narrowing) losses within the Disney+ streaming division. Disney said it expects to get its streaming service out of the red by Q4 2024 as a result of the “restructuring” of the company that “enabled tremendous efficiencies,” CEO Bob Iger told investors during earnings. In addition, it has been cutting down on its streaming losses. As of Q4 2022, Disney+ lost nearly $1.5 billion; in Q4 2023, it lost “just” $387 million. Pixar’s “Elemental” was cited as one of the popular titles to hit the streaming platform in the quarter alongside other Disney and Marvel releases, like “The Little Mermaid” and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.” “Elemental” had grossed half a billion worldwide, Disney said, and was the most-viewed film on Disney+ in the quarter, but was initially considered a box office bomb and one of the worst debuts in Pixar’s 28-year history. The film made up for its poor opening over time, but had followed other under-performing titles like “Lightyear” and “Onward,” which forced Disney to reconsider its release strategy. Pixar’s “Onward,” released in March 2020, had run into issues due to the start of the COVID pandemic, but “Soul,” “Luca” and “Turning Red” were released directly to Disney+. “Disney had more or less trained audiences to expect big, hot Pixar content at home,” explained Brandon Katz, an entertainment industry strategist at Parrot Analytics. “Retraining the audience to re-embrace the theatrical experience and prioritize that…takes time.” Katz also noted that Pixar has had to contend with other changes in audience behavior and preferences, beyond the shift to streaming. For example, audiences in the 2010s preferred pre-established IP, which required less marketing and less buy-in from consumers. Now, audiences are facing sequel and franchise fatigue. “That pendulum swing has been hard for all studios, Pixar included, to keep up with,” Katz added. “If you look at their box office history, [2017’s] ‘Coco’ was their last megabucks box office original — meaning, surpassing $500 million-plus worldwide.” This year, the animation studio is set to release an “Inside Out” sequel and, in 2025, “Elio,” a new film about a boy who goes on an intergalactic adventure. This pace could help keep Pixar’s budget in line, which tends to hover around $200 million per film, Katz noted. Other animation houses have smaller budgets, like $75-100 million at Illumination and $70-145 million at DreamWorks. “Every single film when they’re at, 200 million plus, is going to require significant box office returns to break even and turn a profit,” he said. Earlier in 2023, Pixar laid off 75 positions, including two executives behind “Lightyear,” Reuters reported, including longtime animators Angus MacLane (“Toy Story 4,” “Coco”) and Galyn Susman, who had been with Pixar since the original “Toy Story.” Those cuts were part of Iger’s plan to reduce headcount by 7,000 jobs and $5.5 billion in costs, the report said. “Turning streaming into a profitable growth business” was a top opportunity Iger cited for 2024, he told investors in Q4. Also this year, Disney+ will gain Hulu content in the U.S., in another bid to boost its streaming business, mirroring other consolidation among its peers, including the Warner Bros and Discovery merger and a rumored Paramount merger. Disney execs at the Consumer Electronics Show this week in Las Vegas have been showcasing Disney’s ad tech that works across its linear and streaming platforms, following 2023’s launch of ad-supported streaming on Disney+.

    "originBody": "Unity’s Open-Source Double Standard: the ban of VLC 3 minute read VLC for Unity integrationPermalink For the readers unaware, we started distributing binaries on the Unity Store for the open-source VLC for Unity integration back in December 2019. The integration essentially was a bridge between the Unity game engine and the VLC multimedia engine, allowing to build your own media-player based on VLC technology in Unity-based games. Both Unity, through Mono, and LibVLC are highly portable so this is a compelling argument for this cross-platform integration. Since the start, we have had many users downloading the assets from the Unity Store for their Unity apps and games when requiring demanding multimedia solutions. We had 3 assets targeting specific platforms: Windows, UWP, Android. Unity Store banPermalink This all changed at the end of the summer 2023 when Unity emailed us the following: And just like this, our publisher account was instantly banned. After months of slow back-and-forth over email trying to find a compromise, including offering to exclude LGPL code from the assets, Unity basically told us we were not welcome back to their Store, ever. Even if we were to remove all LGPL code from the Unity package. Where it gets fun is that there are currently hundreds if not thousands of Unity assets that include LGPL dependencies (such as FFmpeg) in the Store right now. Enforcement is seemingly totally random, unless you get reported by someone, apparently. It gets better… Unity itself, both the Editor and the runtime (which means your shipped game) is already using LGPL dependencies! Unity is built on libraries such as Lame, libiconv, libwebsockets and websockify.js (at least). Full list of open-source Unity dependencies here. So Unity gets to use and benefit from LGPL open-source libraries, games built with Unity depend on LGPL code by default (hello glibc!), but publishers and Unity users are not allowed to do so through the Unity Store? Introducing the Videolabs StorePermalink Numerous companies make use of the LibVLC SDK and other related technologies (like FFmpeg). Sometimes they will run into issues or request a new feature and while the community can sometimes help, the limited time of a few volunteers only goes so far. I have written about OSS sustainability before and that is very much on topic here. It is in the best interest of both open-source project maintainers and commercial consumers to have a clear products and services offering for a given project, and that is what we have created with the Videolabs Store for both LibVLC and FFmpeg. If you are a company requiring multimedia products or consulting for your own projects, this store will be of interest to you. Flexible multimedia consulting packagesPermalink The Videolabs team is composed of VLC and FFmpeg experts in most protocols, formats and platforms. If you are using or planning to use LibVLC or FFmpeg in your project and need help, whether it be custom builds, bug fixes, SDK integration or simply answers to your questions for your specific needs, these packages are for you! We have created 3 multimedia consulting packages: 3 hours, 10 hours and 24 hours. They can be purchased for a one-time service or a monthly subscription. No matter which OS platform or toolkit you are building with, we can help. Other productsPermalink The LibVLCSharp commercial license and the LibVLC ebook can also be found in the Videolabs Store, as well as other upcoming products such as Kyber, our new ultra low latency game/desktop streaming and remote control SDK, and more game engine integration such as Unreal. The VLC Unity integration can of course also be purchased from our Store. Stay tuned for more Unity platforms support coming later this month!

    "title": "Is htmx the Ultimate JavaScript Framework for Long-lasting Websites?",
    "originLink": "https://htmx.org/essays/is-htmx-another-javascript-framework/",
    "originBody": "htmx docs reference examples talk essays Is htmx Just Another JavaScript Framework? Alexander Petros January 10, 2024 One of the most common criticisms of htmx, usually from people hearing about it for the first time, goes like this: You’re complaining about the complexity of modern frontend frameworks, but your solution is just another complex frontend framework. This is an excellent objection! It’s the right to question to ask about any third-party (3P) code that you introduce into your project. Even though you aren’t writing the 3P code yourself, by including it in your project you are committed to understanding it—and refreshing that understanding if you want to upgrade it. That’s a big commitment. Let’s break this criticism down into its constituent parts, and determine exactly how much htmx indulges in the harms it claims to solve. #The difference between a library and a framework Some htmx defenders jump to our aid with: “htmx isn’t a framework, it’s a library.” This is probably incorrect. “Framework” is a colloquial term—there’s no hard rule for the point at which some third-party code evolves from a “library” into a “framework”—but we should still try to define it. In this context: Library - 3P code whose API does not significantly influence the rest of the application Framework - 3P code whose API dictates the overall structure of the application If you prefer metaphors: a library is a cog that you add to your machine, a framework is a pre-built machine that you control by customizing its cogs. This distinction, fuzzy though it may be, is important because it describes how easily some third-party code can be replaced. For example, a JavaScript service that uses a CSV parsing library can probably swap in a different CSV parsing library without too much trouble; a JavaScript service that uses the NextJS framework, however, is probably going to depend on NextJS for its entire useful life, since an enormous chunk of the code is written with the assumption that it is interacting with NextJS constructs. Therefore, if your service is built atop a framework, its useful lifespan is tied to the useful lifespan of that framework. If that framework is abandoned, or despised, or otherwise undesirable to work on, the difficulty of modifying your project will steadily increase until you give up modifying it, and eventually, mothball it altogether. That’s what people are worried about when they ask is “is htmx just another JavaScript framework?” They want to be sure that they’re not committing to a system that will be obsolete soon, like so many of the past web development frameworks. So: is htmx a framework? And is it going to be fast made obsolete, leaving a trail of un-maintainable websites in the wake of its meteoric demise? #htmx is (usually) a framework With apologies to our community’s ongoing debate about this question—I think htmx is pretty clearly a framework, at least in the majority use-case. But it does depend on how you use it. Wherever you make use of htmx in your project, you’re including htmx attributes in your HTML (i.e. hx-post, hx-target), writing endpoints that are called with htmx-formatted data (with certain request headers), and returning data from those endpoints that is formatted in ways that htmx expects (HTML with hx-* controls). All of these attributes and headers and endpoints interact with each other to create a system by which elements enter and exit the DOM via network request. If you use htmx to handle a non-trivial number of your website’s network requests, then the inclusion of htmx in your application has significant implications for the project’s structure, from the way you structure your frontend markup, to the database queries your endpoints make. That is framework-like behavior, and in that scenario, htmx cannot be trivially replaced. You can definitely use htmx in a library-like manner, to add dynamic functionality to just a few sections of your web page. But you can write React in this library-like manner too and nobody argues that React isn’t a framework. Suffice to say that many people who use htmx in their applications are doing so in a way that bends to the demands of htmx, as a framework for building hypermedia applications. As they should! Building with htmx works a lot better if you play to its strengths. You can send JSON-formatted form bodies, if you really insist. But you shouldn’t! It’s simpler to just use application/x-www-form-urlencoded bodies, and write an endpoint that accepts them. You can write an endpoint that is re-used across multiple different clients, if you really insist. But you shouldn’t! It’s simpler to split your data and your hypermedia APIs into separate URLs. Yes, htmx can be used as a library, but maybe let it be your framework too. That does not mean, however, that htmx is Just Another JavaScript Framework, because htmx has a huge advantage that the other frameworks do not: HTML. #htmx is for writing HTML Let’s say you’re using htmx as a framework—is it a JavaScript framework? In one obvious sense, yes: htmx is implemented with ~4k lines of JS. But in another, much more important sense, it is not: React, Svelte, Solid, and so on have you write JS(X) that the framework converts into HTML; htmx just has you write HTML. This removes entire categories of maintenance that might make you abandon other frameworks with time. Codebases tend to get stuck when you want to upgrade or change some dependency, but the framework you use is incompatible with that change. Java is the most notorious offender here—there are untold millions of lines of Java in production that will never leave Java 8 because upgrading Spring is too hard—but the npm package ecosystem is a close second. When you use the htmx “framework” you will never have this problem, because htmx is a zero-dependency, client-loaded JavaScript file, so it is guaranteed to never conflict with whatever build process or dependency chain your server does depend on. Browsers render HTML, so no compiler or transpiler is ever necessary to work with htmx. While many htmx users happily render API responses with JSX, htmx works very well with classic template engines, making it portable to whatever language you like. Say what you will about Django and Rails, but they were relevant in 2008 and they’re relevant today—htmx integrates seamlessly with them both. This is a recurring theme with htmx-driven development: htmx works well with development tools old and new, because the common denominator in all these tools is HTML, and htmx is for writing HTML. Pushing the user to define the behavior of their application primarily in HTML, rather than JS, has too many advantages to cover in this essay, so I’ll stick to the one people hate most about JavaScript fameworks: churn. Depending on when you wrote your React application, you might have written your form with controlled class components, or react hooks, or this experimentalextension. This is genuinely maddening, especially if you—like me—first learned how to make a web form with class components. No matter when you wrote your htmx application, however, the behavior of an htmx form has always been defined in largely the same way a regular HTML form is: with . With htmx adding additional network functionality, you can finally use PUT requests and control where the response goes, but in all other respects—validation, inputs, labels, autocomplete—you have defaultelement behavior. Finally, because htmx simply extends HTML in a very narrow domain (network requests and DOM replacements), most of the “htmx” you write is just plain old HTML. When you have access to complex state management mechanisms, it’s incredibly easy to implement a custom collapsable div; when you don’t, you might stop long enough to search up theelement. Whenever a problem can be solved by native HTML elements, the longevity of the code improves tremendously as a result. This is a much less alienating way to learn web development, because the bulk of your knowledge will remain relevant as long as HTML does. In this respect, htmx is much more like JQuery than React (htmx’s predecessor, intercooler.js, was a JQuery extension), but it improves on JQuery by using a declarative, HTML-based interface: where JQuery made you go to the tag to specify AJAX behavior, htmx requires only a simple hx-post attribute. In short, while htmx can be used as a framework, it’s a framework that deviates far less from the web’s semantics than the JavaScript frameworks do, and will benefit from improvements in those semantics with no additional work from the user, thanks to the web’s excellent backwards compatibility guarantees. If you want to build a website that lasts for a long time, these qualities make htmx a substantially better bet than many of its contemporaries. NOTE: Despite agreeing with this analysis, finding no logical flaws in the essay, and allowing me to publish it on his website, Carson continues to insist that htmx is a library.haiku javascript fatigue: longing for a hypertext already in hand docs reference examples talk essays @htmx_org",

In today’s Finshots, we go back over two decades to how a mega-merger leading to a clash of cultures might have been the downfall of Boeing.

We strip stories off the jargon and deliver crisp financial insights straight to your inbox. Just one mail every morning. Promise! If you’re already a subscriber or you’re reading this on the app, you can just go ahead and read the story. The Story At 5 pm on 5th January, 171 passengers boarded an Alaska Airlines flight from Oregon to California. But barely 10 minutes in the air and cruising at 16,000 feet, this routine flight quickly turned into a nightmare… The plane broke! Or rather, a part of the plane disappeared. A gaping hole emerged, the wind rushed in, phones and caps were sucked out, oxygen masks dropped, and the passengers clung on for dear life. The pilots made an emergency landing. And let’s just say that, luckily, everyone made it out alive. But all eyes are on Boeing now. Its 737 Max 9 variant has been temporarily banned from taking off in the US. And the problem for Boeing is that it’s another body blow in a long series of problems in the past few years. Remember when two of its Max airlines plummeted to the ground in 2018 and killed hundreds of people on board? Yeah, things aren’t looking good for the plane manufacturer. And we must ask — where did it all go so wrong for Boeing? Well, it probably all began in the summer of 1997. Boeing wanted to establish dominance and show the world who was boss in the airline industry. So it decided to acquire another plane manufacturer called McDonnell Douglas. It was a massive merger worth $14 billion. Now after the merger, the new entity retained the Boeing name. It was expected since it was Boeing that splashed the cash. But the problem was that the culture of McDonnell Douglas seeped in. And that changed the face of Boeing completely. See, the Boeing of the pre-merger era was called an ‘engineers’ company’. The ones who made these flying machines called the shots. Costs didn’t matter and it was only quality and design that did. They wanted to ensure that only their best ideas took to the skies. Safety was paramount. And the Chief Financial Officer who was answerable to Wall Street about costs didn’t care much about trying to impress the bankers either. But after the merger, everything changed. The CEO of McDonnell Douglas actually became the CEO of Boeing. A chairman with no aviation background, but who’d worked in General Electric, was also appointed. The company started paying attention to creating shareholder value which was hardly a priority earlier. And as one article put it, “Now, a passion for great planes was replaced with a passion for affordability.” Boeing even turned to outsourcing critical operations. Sure, it made the balance sheet ‘asset light’, but, it came at the cost of quality. To top it all off, they even moved management headquarters away from where all the engineering took place — from Seattle to Chicago. At first, no one said anything. Sure, there was a joke that went, “McDonnell Douglas bought Boeing with Boeing’s money.” But it was a harmless observation. The planes kept rolling off the conveyor belt. But then 2018 happened. And the death of Boeing’s culture came to the fore. See, American Airlines was looking to place an order with Boeing’s rival Airbus. Airbus had created the A320neo which was more fuel-efficient. And while initially, Boeing scoffed at Airbus, the call from American Airlines was a jolt out of the blue. That’s when Boeing realised it had fallen behind. But it didn’t have time on its hands to innovate and build something from scratch. And that’s when the McDonnell Douglas way of doing things caught on — instead of spending $20 billion on a new plane, Boeing budgeted a puny $2.5 billion and decided to tweak its iconic 737. Technical drawings for the model were being churned out at double the pace, workers from other departments were pulled in for the Max project, and timely delivery took precedence over quality. The idea was to make small but significant changes to 737 while sticking to the original design so that pilots wouldn’t really have to be retrained either. But, flying a machine in the sky isn’t child’s play. Apparently, from 2010 to 2014, Boeing’s CEO never mentioned safety even once in their annual statement. And we all know what happens when ethics and quality fly out of the window! And in 2018, when two 737 Max planes crashed and killed hundreds of people, everyone knew that it was the billion-dollar merger with McDonnell Douglas that ultimately became Boeing’s downfall. The sad part? The problems don’t seem to be ending. In the past couple of years, Boeing has said that some of its aircraft might have loose bolts that could be dangerous. It said that one of its suppliers drilled holes in the wrong places for some jets. And it even stumbled in its quest to build the US President’s new Air Force One. For Boeing, the merger from 1997 is coming back to haunt it. The Max is the best-selling plane in Boeing’s history. And 76% of the company’s outstanding order book involves variants of these aircraft. And it’ll be a tough task to convince people that Boeing has not forgotten how to build an aeroplane.
