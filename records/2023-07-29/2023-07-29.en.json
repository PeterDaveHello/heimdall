Today I’m releasing version 1.0 of Cap’n Proto’s C++ reference implementation.Don’t get too excited! There’s not actually much new. Frankly, I should have declared 1.0 a long time ago – probably around version 0.6 (in 2017) or maybe even 0.5 (in 2014). I didn’t mostly because there were a few advanced features (like three-party handoff, or shared-memory RPC) that I always felt like I wanted to finish before 1.0, but they just kept not reaching the top of my priority list. But the reality is that Cap’n Proto has been relied upon in production for a long time. In fact, you are using Cap’n Proto right now, to view this site, which is served by Cloudflare, which uses Cap’n Proto extensively (and is also my employer, although they used Cap’n Proto before they hired me). Cap’n Proto is used to encode millions (maybe billions) of messages and gigabits (maybe terabits) of data every single second of every day. As for those still-missing features, the real world has seemingly proven that they aren’t actually that important. (I still do want to complete them though.)Ironically, the thing that finally motivated the 1.0 release is so that we can start working on 2.0. But again here, don’t get too excited! Cap’n Proto 2.0 is not slated to be a revolutionary change. Rather, there are a number of changes we (the Cloudflare Workers team) would like to make to Cap’n Proto’s C++ API, and its companion, the KJ C++ toolkit library. Over the ten years these libraries have been available, I have kept their APIs pretty stable, despite being 0.x versioned. But for 2.0, we want to make some sweeping backwards-incompatible changes, in order to fix some footguns and improve developer experience for those on our team.Some users probably won’t want to keep up with these changes. Hence, I’m releasing 1.0 now as a sort of “long-term support” release. We’ll backport bugfixes as appropriate to the 1.0 branch for the long term, so that people who aren’t interested in changes can just stick with it.What’s actually new in 1.0?Again, not a whole lot has changed since the last version, 0.10. But there are a few things worth mentioning:A number of optimizations were made to improve performance of Cap’n Proto RPC. These include reducing the amount of memory allocation done by the RPC implementation and KJ I/O framework, adding the ability to elide certain messages from the RPC protocol to reduce traffic, and doing better buffering of small messages that are sent and received together to reduce syscalls. These are incremental improvements.Breaking change: Previously, servers could opt into allowing RPC cancellation by calling context.allowCancellation() after a call was delivered. In 1.0, opting into cancellation is instead accomplished using an annotation on the schema (the allowCancellation annotation defined in c++.capnp). We made this change after observing that in practice, we almost always wanted to allow cancellation, but we almost always forgot to do so. The schema-level annotation can be set on a whole file at a time, which is easier not to forget. Moreover, the dynamic opt-in required a lot of bookkeeping that had a noticeable performance impact in practice; switching to the annotation provided a performance boost. For users that never used context.allowCancellation() in the first place, there’s no need to change anything when upgrading to 1.0 – cancellation is still disallowed by default. (If you are affected, you will see a compile error. If there’s no compile error, you have nothing to worry about.)KJ now uses kqueue() to handle asynchronous I/O on systems that have it (MacOS and BSD derivatives). KJ has historically always used epoll on Linux, but until now had used a slower poll()-based approach on other Unix-like platforms.KJ’s HTTP client and server implementations now support the CONNECT method.A new class capnp::RevocableServer was introduced to assist in exporting RPC wrappers around objects whose lifetimes are not controlled by the wrapper. Previously, avoiding use-after-free bugs in such scenarios was tricky.Many, many smaller bug fixes and improvements. See the PR history for details.What’s planned for 2.0?The changes we have in mind for version 2.0 of Cap’n Proto’s C++ implementation are mostly NOT related to the protocol itself, but rather to the C++ API and especially to KJ, the C++ toolkit library that comes with Cap’n Proto. These changes are motivated by our experience building a large codebase on top of KJ: namely, the Cloudflare Workers runtime, workerd.KJ is a C++ toolkit library, arguably comparable to things like Boost, Google’s Abseil, or Facebook’s Folly. I started building KJ at the same time as Cap’n Proto in 2013, at a time when C++11 was very new and most libraries were not really designing around it yet. The intent was never to create a new standard library, but rather to address specific needs I had at the time. But over many years, I ended up building a lot of stuff. By the time I joined Cloudflare and started the Workers Runtime, KJ already featured a powerful async I/O framework, HTTP implementation, TLS bindings, and more.Of course, KJ has nowhere near as much stuff as Boost or Abseil, and nowhere near as much engineering effort behind it. You might argue, therefore, that it would have been better to choose one of those libraries to build on. However, KJ had a huge advantage: that we own it, and can shape it to fit our specific needs, without having to fight with anyone to get those changes upstreamed.One example among many: KJ’s HTTP implementation features the ability to “suspend” the state of an HTTP connection, after receiving headers, and transfer it to a different thread or process to be resumed. This is an unusual thing to want, but is something we needed for resource management in the Workers Runtime. Implementing this required some deep surgery in KJ HTTP and definitely adds complexity. If we had been using someone else’s HTTP library, would they have let us upstream such a change?That said, even though we own KJ, we’ve still tried to avoid making any change that breaks third-party users, and this has held back some changes that would probably benefit Cloudflare Workers. We have therefore decided to “fork” it. Version 2.0 is that fork.Development of version 2.0 will take place on Cap’n Proto’s new v2 branch. The master branch will become the 1.0 LTS branch, so that existing projects which track master are not disrupted by our changes.We don’t yet know all the changes we want to make as we’ve only just started thinking seriously about it. But, here’s some ideas we’ve had so far:We will require a compiler with support for C++20, or maybe even C++23. Cap’n Proto 1.0 only requires C++14.In particular, we will require a compiler that supports C++20 coroutines, as lots of KJ async code will be refactored to rely on coroutines. This should both make the code clearer and improve performance by reducing memory allocations. However, coroutine support is still spotty – as of this writing, GCC seems to ICE on KJ’s coroutine implementation.Cap’n Proto’s RPC API, KJ’s HTTP APIs, and others are likely to be revised to make them more coroutine-friendly.kj::Maybe will become more ergonomic. It will no longer overload nullptr to represent the absence of a value; we will introduce kj::none instead. KJ_IF_MAYBE will no longer produce a pointer, but instead a reference (a trick that becomes possible by utilizing C++17 features).We will drop support for compiling with exceptions disabled. KJ’s coding style uses exceptions as a form of software fault isolation, or “catchable panics”, such that errors can cause the “current task” to fail out without disrupting other tasks running concurrently. In practice, this ends up affecting every part of how KJ-style code is written. And yet, since the beginning, KJ and Cap’n Proto have been designed to accommodate environments where exceptions are turned off at compile time, using an elaborate system to fall back to callbacks and distinguish between fatal and non-fatal exceptions. In practice, maintaining this ability has been a drag on development – no-exceptions mode is constantly broken and must be tediously fixed before each release. Even when the tests are passing, it’s likely that a lot of KJ’s functionality realistically cannot be used in no-exceptions mode due to bugs and fragility. Today, I would strongly recommend against anyone using this mode except maybe for the most basic use of Cap’n Proto’s serialization layer. Meanwhile, though, I’m honestly not sure if anyone uses this mode at all! In theory I would expect many people do, since many people choose to use C++ with exceptions disabled, but I’ve never actually received a single question or bug report related to it. It seems very likely that this was wasted effort all along. By removing support, we can simplify a lot of stuff and probably do releases more frequently going forward.Similarly, we’ll drop support for no-RTTI mode and other exotic modes that are a maintenance burden.We may revise KJ’s approach to reference counting, as the current design has proven to be unintuitive to many users.We will fix a longstanding design flaw in kj::AsyncOutputStream, where EOF is currently signaled by destroying the stream. Instead, we’ll add an explicit end() method that returns a Promise. Destroying the stream without calling end() will signal an erroneous disconnect. (There are several other aesthetic improvements I’d like to make to the KJ stream APIs as well.)We may want to redesign several core I/O APIs to be a better fit for Linux’s new-ish io_uring event notification paradigm.The RPC implementation may switch to allowing cancellation by default. As discussed above, this is opt-in today, but in practice I find it’s almost always desirable, and disallowing it can lead to subtle problems.And so on.It’s worth noting that at present, there is no plan to make any backwards-incompatible changes to the serialization format or RPC protocol. The changes being discussed only affect the C++ API. Applications written in other languages are completely unaffected by all this.It’s likely that a formal 2.0 release will not happen for some time – probably a few years. I want to make sure we get through all the really big breaking changes we want to make, before we inflict update pain on most users. Of course, if you’re willing to accept breakages, you can always track the v2 branch. Cloudflare Workers releases from v2 twice a week, so it should always be in good working order.Introduction NewsCap'n Proto 1.0CVE-2022-46149: Possible out-of-bounds read related to list-of-pointersCap'n Proto 0.10Cap'n Proto 0.9Cap'n Proto 0.8: Streaming flow control, HTTP-over-RPC, fibers, etc.Cap'n Proto 0.7 ReleasedCap'n Proto 0.6 Released: Two and a half years of improvementsAnother security advisory -- Additional CPU amplification caseSecurity Advisory -- And how to catch integer overflows with template metaprogrammingCap'n Proto 0.5.1: BugfixesCap'n Proto 0.5: Generics, Visual C++, Java, C#, Sandstorm.ioCap'n Proto, FlatBuffers, and SBECap'n Proto 0.4.1: Bugfix ReleasePromise Pipelining and Dependent Calls: Cap'n Proto vs. Thrift vs. IceCap'n Proto v0.4: Time Traveling RPCCap'n Proto v0.3: Python, tools, new featuresCap'n Proto v0.2.1: Minor bug fixesCap'n Proto v0.2: Compiler rewritten Haskell -> C++Cap'n Proto Beta ReleaseAnnouncing Cap'n ProtoInstallation Schema Language Encoding RPC Protocol The capnp Tool C++ Serialization C++ RPC Other Languages Road Map FAQMaintained by kentonv and friends ∙ Design by sailorhgFollow Cap'n Proto on Twitter",

Before making a request to the community, I want to express how deeply saddened I am by this loss. Ian and I collaborated extensively over the past three years, and we had become friends.As the de facto project lead, it now befalls me to fill Ian's very big shoes. Please, if you're able to contribute to the project, I could really use the help. And if you're a contributor or maintainer of some other implementation (C++, Rust, etc.), I would *REALLY* appreciate it if we could connect. I'm going to need to surround myself with very smart people if I am to continue Ian's work.RIP Ian, and thank you. I learned so much working with you.------P.S: I can be reached in the following places- https://github.com/lthibault- https://matrix.to/#/#go-capnp:matrix.org- Telegram: @lthibault- gmail: louist87replyfreedomben 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] I've had a couple people suddenly taken from me, and it is soul crushing.

It might be a good idea to mirror his blog before the domain expires, as it's a real treasure-trove.replyocdtrekkie 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I already have a copy (it's a static site).

But yes, Ian was truly prolific.replydoh 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] That is really sad news. Ian was an inspiration. Sorry for your loss and the loss of the whole community. He will be greatly missed.replyCodesInChaos 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I find it surprising how few protocols (besides Cap'n Proto) have promise pipelining. The only other example I can think of is 9p, but that's not a general purpose protocol.https://capnproto.org/news/2013-12-13-promise-pipelining-cap...replyjayd16 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] As neat as it is I guess it's hard optimize the backend for it compared to explicitly grouping the queries. I imagine a bespoke RPC call that results in a single SQL query is better than several pipelined but separate RPC calls, for example.But even still, you would think it would be more popular.replykentonv 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If you're thinking strictly about stateless backends that just convert every request into a SQL query, then yeah, promise pipelining might not be very helpful.I think where it shines is when interacting with stateful services. I think part of the reason everyone tries to make everything stateless is because we don't have good protocols for managing state. Cap'n Proto RPC is actually quite good at it.replycmrdporcupine 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The issue is that having per-session/transaction state on the server makes load balancing requests more difficult; especially when that state is long-lived.replykentonv 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] While it's true that load-balancing long-lived resources is harder than short-lived, a lot of the difficulty of load balancing with stateful servers is actually in the protocol, because you somehow have to make sure subsequent requests for the same state land on the correct server.Cap'n Proto actually does really well with this basic difficulty, because it treats object references as a first-class thing. When you create some state, you receive back a reference to the state, and you can make subsequent requests on that reference. The load balancer can see that this has happened, even if it doesn't know the details of the application, because object references are marked as such at the RPC layer independent of schema. Whereas in a system that returns some sort of \"object ID\" as a string, and expects you to pass that ID back to the server on subsequent requests, the load balancer is not going to have any idea what's going on, unless you do extra work to teach the load balancer about your protocol.replyparkerduckworth 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Wow that is super interesting. Thanks for sharing.replyTOGoS 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If it's the same backend handling multiple chained requests that happen to use the same database, it could in turn build a single big SQL query to generate the result(s). I used to write stuff like this all the time (not specifically Cap'n Proto servers, but general functional expression -> SQL -> here's your answer engines).replycatern 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I didn't know 9p had promise pipelining!Or more specifically, it seems to have client-chosen file descriptors, so the client can open a file, then immediately send a read on that file, and if the open fails, the read will also fail (with EBADF). Awesome!This is great, but \"promise pipelining\" also needs support in the client. Are there 9p clients which support promise pipelining? For example, if the user issues several walks, they're all sent before waiting for the reply to the first walk?Also, it only has promise pipelining for file descriptors. That gives you a lot, definitely, but if for example you wanted to read every file in a directory, you'd want to be able to issue a read and then walk to the result of that read. Which 9p doesn't seem to support. (I actually support this in my own remote syscall protocol library thing, rsyscall :) )replymananaysiempre 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There is also CapnP’s moral ancestor CapTP[1]/VatTP aka Pluribus developed to accompany Mark Miller’s E language (yes, it’s a pun, there is also a gadget called an “unum” in there). For deeper genealogy—including a reference to Barbara Liskov for promise pipelining and a number of other relevant ideas in the CLU extension Argus—see his thesis[2].(If I’m not misremembering, Mark Miller later wrote the promise proposal for JavaScript, except the planned extension for RPC never materialized and instead we got async/await, which don’t seem compatible with pipelining.)The more recent attempts to make a distributed capability system in the image of E, like Spritely Goblins[3] and the OCapN effort[4], also try for pipelining, so maybe if you hang out on cap-talk[5] you’ll hear about a couple of other protocols that do it, if not ones with any real-world usage.(And I again reiterate that, neat as it is, promise pipelining seems to require programming with actual explicit promises, and at this point it’s well-established how gnarly that can get.)One idea that I find interesting and little-known from the other side—event loops and cooperatively concurrent “active objects”—is “causality IDs”[6] from DCOM/COM+ as a means of controlling reentrancy, see CoGetCurrentLogicalThreadId[7] in the Microsoft documentation and the discussion of CALLTYPE_TOPLEVEL_CALLPENDING in Effective COM[8]—I think they later tried to sell this as a new feature in Win8/UWP’s ASTAs[9]?[1] http://erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html[2] http://erights.org/talks/thesis/index.html[3] https://spritely.institute/goblins/[4] https://github.com/ocapn/ocapn[5] https://groups.google.com/g/captalk/[6] https://learn.microsoft.com/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-d...[7] https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/combaseapi/nf-...[8] https://archive.org/details/effectivecom50wa00boxd/page/150[9] https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20210224-00/?p=10...replydontlaugh 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] io_uring supports that too, although not a network protocol.replymananaysiempre 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Last time I checked (a couple of years ago) they wanted to use eBPF to handle this sort of problem. Did they end up doing something simpler?replydontlaugh 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes. io_uring lets you issue multiple syscalls together, with the result from some being parameters for others.replydan-robertson 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Without knowing how exactly capnproto promise pipelining works, when I thought about it, I was concerned about cases like reading a directory and stating everything in it, or getting back two response values and wanting to pass only one to the next call. The latter could be made to work, I guess, but the former depends on eg the number of values in the result list.replykentonv 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In the actual implementation, when making a pipelined call on a result X, you actually say something like \"Call X.foo.bar.baz()\" -- that is, you can specify a nested property of the results which names the object that you actually want to operate on.At present, the only operation allowed here is reading a nested property, and that seems to solve 99% of use cases. But one could imagine allowing other operations, like \"take the Nth element of this array\" or even \"apply this call to all elements in the array, returning an array of results\".replygiovannibonetti 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Redis transactions [1] also apply pipelining, but AFAICT there is no practical way to use them for implementing generic RPC.[1] https://redis.com/ebook/part-2-core-concepts/chapter-4-keepi...replyackfoobar 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Does the pipelining in Redis allow you to have the second command depend on the result of the first command?replybyroot 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, but for that use case you have EVAL which execute an arbitrary lua script on the server.https://redis.io/commands/eval/replyjauntywundrkind 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That assumes you know & can generate the complete pipeline ahead of time. The elegance of promise pipelining is that your pipeline can also be asynchronously grown.replyTimon3 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] Congrats on the release! It must be very exciting after 10 years :)If you don't mind the question: will there be more work on implementations for other languages in the future? I really like the idea of the format, but the main languages in our stack aren't supported in a way I'd use in a product.replykentonv 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] This is indeed the main weakness of Cap'n Proto. I only really maintain the C++ implementation. Other implementations come from various contributors which can lead to varying levels of completeness and quality.Unfortunately I can't really promise anything new here. My work on Cap'n Proto is driven by the needs of my main project, the Cloudflare Workers runtime, which is primarily C++. We do interact with Go and Rust services, and the respective implementations seem to get the job done there.Put another way, Cap'n Proto is an open source project, and I hope it is useful to people, but it is not a product I'm trying to sell, so I am not particularly focused on trying to get everyone to adopt it. As always, contributions are welcome.The one case where I might foresee a big change is if we (Cloudflare) decided to make Cap'n Proto be a public-facing feature of the Workers platform. Then we'd have a direct need to really polish it in many languages. That is certainly something we discuss from time to time but there are no plans at present.replydoctorpangloss 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Hmm, the main weakness of Cap'n Proto is that you have to already know so much stuff in order to understand why it makes all the great decisions it does. The weakness you're talking about matters to me, sure, I don't use Cap'n'Proto because it lacks the same tooling as gRPC, but it is better than gRPC from an ideas point of view.I am not going to write those language implementations, I have other stuff I need to do, and gRPC is good enough. But the people who love writing language implementations might not understand why Cap'n Proto is great, or at least not understand as well as they understand Golang and Rust, so they will rewrite X in Golang and Rust instead.Anyway, the great ideas haven't changed in whatever it is, almost 10-15 years you've been working on this, they've been right all along. So it is really about communication.A comment on HN that really stuck with me was like: \"Man dude, this is great, but try to explain to my team that it's Not React. They won't care.\"I'm just a guy, I don't know how to distill how good Cap'n Proto is. But \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks\" is the prototype. What is the unreasonable effectiveness of Cap'n Proto? In games, which I'm familiar with, entity component systems, user generated content and their tooling have a lot in common with Cap'n Proto. \"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of ECS\" is deterministic multiplayer, but that is also really poorly communicated, and thus limits adoption. Maybe you are already facing the same obstacles with Cloudflare Workers. It's all very communications related and I hope you get more adoption.replyocdtrekkie 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, this has been the struggle with Sandstorm and self-hosting too. Ten years on, I'm still confident it's the best way to self-host, but to convince someone of that I have to sit them down and figure out how to get them to understand capability-based security, and most people lose interest about... immediately. :PI suspect a lot of things will eventually look more like Cap'n Proto and Sandstorm, but it will take a lot of time for everyone else to get there.replypbronez 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m sold on Sandstorm, but the company folded before I could do anything with it. If someone makes another push at it, I have a lot of security-focused enterprise folks who want more robust & streamlined ways to self host stuff.replyocdtrekkie 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have been pretty invested into Sandstorm for like ten years now, so I am very interested in getting that new push moving. If you know people interested in contributing to the project in any way, we are definitely interested in looking at ways to make it happen.We will probably put out a blog post sometime soon with an update.replyTimon3 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's completely understandable, thank you for the answer! I'd love to try and help with at least one implementation for those languages, but there's a good chance that it would end up like the existing implementations due to lack of time.Anyway, thank you for making it open source and for working on it all this time!replythegagne 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > if we (Cloudflare) decided to make Cap'n Proto be a public-facing feature of the Workers platform.How likely is this? What would be the benefits and use-cases of doing this? Would it be a standardized JS offering, or something specific to Workers that is deserialized before it hits the runtime?replykentonv 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This really hasn't been fleshed out at all, it's more like: \"Well, we're built on Cap'n Proto, it'd be really easy to expose it for applications to use. But is it useful?\"Arguably Cap'n Proto RPC might be an interesting way for a Worker running on Cloudflare to talk to a back-end service, or to a service running in a container (if/when we support containers). Today you mostly have to use HTTP for this (which has its drawbacks) or raw TCP (which requires bringing your own protocol parser to run in \"userspace\").That said there's obviously a much stronger case to make for supporting gRPC or other protocols that are more widely used.replybsder 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There are people who have tried to write the RPC layer without it simply being a wrapper around the C++ implementation, but it's a LOT of code to rewrite for not a lot of direct benefit.Feel free to take a crack at it. People would likely be rather cooperative about it. However, know that it's just simply a lot of work.replyhiddencost 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] For context: Kenton ran Google's in house proto system for many years, before leaving and building his own open source version.replyAceJohnny2 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] I believe he was the one who open-sourced protobufs.replymaccam912 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] If any cloudflare employees end up here who helped decide on Capn Proto over other stuff (e.g. protobuf), what considerations went into that choice? I'm curious if the reasons will be things important to me, or things that you don't need to worry about unless you deal with huge scale.replykentonv 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] Here's a blog post about Cloudflare's use of Cap'n Proto in 2014, three years before I joined: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-lua-capnproto-better...To this day, Cloudflare's data pipeline (which produces logs and analytics from the edge) is largely based on Cap'n Proto serialization. I haven't personally been much involved with that project.As for Cloudflare Workers, of course, I started the project, so I used my stuff. Probably not the justification you're looking for. :)That said, I would argue the extreme expressiveness of Cap'n Proto's RPC protocol compared to alternatives has been a big help in implementing sandboxing in the Workers Runtime, as well as distributed systems features like Durable Objects. https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-obje...replycoolsunglasses 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I don't work at Cloudflare but follow their work and occasionally work on performance sensitive projects.If I had to guess, they looked at the landscape a bit like I do and regarded Cap'n Proto, flatbuffers, SBE, etc. as being in one category apart from other data formats like Avro, protobuf, and the like.So once you're committed to record'ish shaped (rather than columnar like Parquet) data that has an upfront parse time of zero (nominally, there could be marshalling if you transmogrify the field values on read), the list gets pretty short.https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-... goes into some of the trade-offs here.Cap'n Proto was originally made for https://sandstorm.io/.

As I understood it, the primary engineer who built all of that out, Albert Strasheim, benchmarked the most likely serialization options available and found Cap'n Proto to be appreciably faster than protobuf. It had a great C++ implementation (which we could use from nginx, IIRC with some lua involved) and while the Go implementation, which we used on the consuming side, had its warts, folks were able to fix the key parts that needed attention.Anyway. Cloudflare's always been pretty cost efficient machine wise, so it was a natural choice given the performance needs we had. In my time in the data team there, Cap'n Proto was always pretty easy to work with, and sharing proto definitions from a central schema repo worked pretty well, too.

Personally, I previously also struggled to understand why. For me, the thing that clicked was to understand protobuf and Cap'n proto as serialization formats that need to work across API boundaries and need to work with different versions of their schema in a backwards- and forwards-compatible way; do not treat them as in-memory data structures that represent the world from the perspective of a single process running a single version without no compatibility concerns. Thus, the widely repeated mantra of \"making illegal states unrepresentable\" does not apply.replychubot 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Rich Hickey (creator of the Clojure language) has a good talk \"Maybe Not\" that touches on these issues, with a nice way of explaining ithttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpougThe capnproto link explains it concretely in terms of a message bus example, which is useful.But more abstractly you can think of the shape of data (aka schema, names and types) and field presence (optional/required) as separate thingshttps://lobste.rs/s/zdvg9y/maybe_not_rich_hickeyFirst, being valid or invalid with respect to a static type system is a GLOBAL property of program -- writing a type checker will convince you of that. And big distributed systems don't have such global properties: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36590799If they did, they'd be small :) Namely you could just reboot the whole thing at once. You can't reboot say the entire Internet at once, and this also holds for smaller systems, like the ones at say Google (and I'm sure Cloudflare, etc.).So the idea is that the shape/schema is a GLOBAL property -- you never want two messages called foo.RequestX or two fields called \"num_bar\" with different types -- ever, anywhere.But optional/required is LOCAL property. It depends on what version of a schema is deployed in a particular binary. Inherently, you need to be able to handle a mix of inconsistent versions running simultaneously.---To be pedantic, I woulds say \"making illegal states unrepresentable\" DOES apply, but you can't do it in a STATIC type system. [1] Your Maybe type is not useful for data that crosses process boundaries.A distributed system isn't a state machine.1. Lamport showed us one important reason why: the relative order of messages means that there is no globally coherent state. You need something like Paxos to turn a distributed system back into a state machine (and this is very expensive in general)2. The second reason is probably a consequence of the first. You can think of deploying a binary to a node as a message to that node. So you don't have a completely consistent state -- you always have an in-between state, a mix of versions. And presumably you want your system to keep working during this time period :)And that coarse-grained problem (code versioning and deployment) implies the fine-grained problem (whether a specific message in a field is present). This is because protobufs generate parsers with validation for you -- or they used to!---tl;dr Think of the shape of data (aka schema) and field presence (optional/required) as different dimensions of data modeling. Maybe mixes those up, which is fine in a single process, but doesn't work across processes.---[1] A very specific example of making illegal states unrepresentable without static types - my Oils project uses a DSL for algebraic data types, borrowed from CPython. The funny thing is that in CPython, it generates C code, which doesn't have any static notion of Maybe. It has tagged unions.And in Oils we first generated dynamically typed Python at first. Somewhat surprisingly, algebraic data types are STILL useful there.Now the generated code is statically typed with MyPy (and with C++), and we do pleasant type-driven refactorings. But using algebraic data types were still extremely useful before static typing. They made illegal states unrepresentable -- but you would get the error at runtime.replyskybrian 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I wonder about how to make this play nicely with systems that have different perspectives. Yes, a message bus is written to deal with any possible message and it can do that because it doesn't care what's in the message. Incomplete messages are useful to have, too.This is sort of like the difference between a text editor and a compiler. An editor has to deal with code that doesn't even parse, which is easiest if just treats it as a plain text file, but then you're missing a lot of language-specific features that we take for granted these days. Meanwhile, a compiler can require all errors to be fixed before it emits a binary, but it has to be good at reporting what the errors are, because they will certainly happen.It's unclear to me how the type of the field can be a global property in a large system. From a text editor's point of view, you can just edit the type. How can anyone guarantee that a type is always the same?Also, SQL tables actually do make closed-world assumptions; every record meets the schema, or it can't be stored there. If you change the schema, there is a migration step where all the old rows in the production database gets upgraded. This doesn't seem unrealistic?I guess it's unrealistic that you only have one production database, and not also a staging database, and every developer having their own database? And they will be on different versions. As soon as you have lots of databases, things get complicated.replyoftenwrong 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Typical provides \"asymmetric\" fields to assist with evolution of types:https://github.com/stepchowfun/typical#asymmetric-fields-can...>To help you safely add and remove required fields, Typical offers an intermediate state between optional and required: asymmetric.

Unlike optional fields, an asymmetric field can safely be promoted to required and vice versa.replyskybrian 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, it only works for migrations in fairly closed systems where you can upgrade or delete all the old data, though.reply3cats-in-a-coat 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Can't we extend this argument to eliminating basically all static typing? And frankly that'd not even be wrong, and is why Alan Kay defined OOP as one that's dynamically typed and late bound, and we went against it anyway to keep relearning the same lessons over and over.replykentonv 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The argument is really more like: Always defer validation until the point where the data is actually consumed, because only the consumer actually knows what is valid.Which is definitely a counterpoint to the oft-stated argument that you should validate all data upfront.Either way though, you can still have types, the question is just when and where (in a distributed system, especially) they should be checked.replymike_hearn 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The argument is actually more like: don't use badly written middleman software that tries to parse messages it doesn't need to parse.I was at Google when the \"let's get rid of optional\" crusade started. It didn't make sense to me then and over a decade later it still doesn't. If a program expects a field to be there then it has to be there, removing the protobuf level checking just meant that programs could now read garbage (some default value) instead of immediately crashing. But the whole reason we have types, assertions, bounds checking and so on is because, almost always, we'd like our software to NOT just blindly plough on into undefined territory when it doesn't understand something properly, so in reality it just means everyone ends up coding those very same required-ness assertions by hand.Now, Google's business model is remarkably robust to generating and processing corrupt data, so you can argue that in the specific case of this specific company, it is actually better to silently serve garbage than to crash. This argument was made explicitly in other forms, like when they deleted all the assertions from the HTTP load balancers. But in every case where I examined an anti-required argument carefully the actual problem would turn out to be elsewhere, and removing assertions was just covering things up. The fact that so much of Google's code is written in C++ that not only starts up slowly but also just immediately aborts the entire process when something goes wrong also contributes to the brittleness that encourages this kind of thing. If Google had been built on a language with usable exceptions right from the start it'd have been easier to limit the blast radius of data structure versioning errors to only the requests where that data structure turned up, instead of causing them to nuke the entire server (and then the RPC stack will helpfully retry because it doesn't know why the server died, promptly killing all of them).But this tolerance to undefined behavior is not true for almost any other business (except maybe video games?). In those businesses it's better to be stopped than wrong. If you don't then you can lose money, lose data, lose customers or in the worst cases even lose your life. I don't think people appreciate the extent to which the unique oddities of Google's business model and infrastructure choices have leaked out into the libraries their staffers/ex-staffers release.replykentonv 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > The argument is actually more like: don't use badly written middleman software that tries to parse messages it doesn't need to parse.The middleman software in question often needed to process some part of the message but not others. It wasn't realistic to define a boundary between what each middleman might need and what they wouldn't need, and somehow push the \"not needed\" part into nested encoded blobs.I'm not sure the rest of your comment is really addressing the issue here. The argument doesn't have anything to do with proceeding forward in the face of corrupt data or undefined behavior. The argument is that validation needs to happen at the consumer. There should still be validation.replynaasking 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > It wasn't realistic to define a boundary between what each middleman might need and what they wouldn't need, and somehow push the \"not needed\" part into nested encoded blobs.This is an interesting argument that I would like to see more elaboration on, because that's the obvious solution. Effectively you're building a pipeline of data processors and each stage in the pipeline reads its own information and then passes along a payload with the rest of the information to the next stage. This would preserve full static typing with required fields, but I can see how it might inhibit some forms of dynamic instrumentation, eg. turning verbose logging on/off might dynamically reconfigure the pipeline, which would affect all upstream producers if they're wrapping messages for downstream consumers.If this were a programming language I would immediately think of row typing to specify the parts that each stage depends on while being agnostic about the rest of the content, but I'm not sure how that might work for a serialization format. Effectively, you're pulling out a typed \"view\" over the underlying data that contains offsets to the underlying fields (this is the dictionary-passing transform as found in Haskell).replykentonv 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The particular piece of infrastructure I worked on sat in the middle of the search pipeline, between the front-end that served HTML web pages, and the back-end index. This middle piece would request search results from the back-end, tweak them in a bunch of ways, and forward them on.These \"tweaks\" could be just about anything. Like: \"You searched for Jaguar, but I don't know if you meant the cat or the car. The index decided that pages about the car rank higher so the first three pages of results are about the car. I'm going to pull some results about the cat from page 4 and put them near the top so just in case that's what you really wanted, you'll find it.\"Google Search, at least when I worked on it, was composed of a huge number of such tweaks. People were constantly proposing them, testing if they led to an improvement, and shipping them if they do. For a variety of reasons, our middleman server was a great place to implement certain kinds of tweaks.But what kinds of information are needed for these \"tweaks\"? Could be anything! It's a general-purpose platform. Search results were annotated with all kinds of crazy information, and any piece of information might be useful in implementing some sort of middleman tweak at some point.So you couldn't very well say upfront \"OK, we're going to put all the info that is only for the frontend into the special 'frontend blob' that doesn't get parsed by the middleman\", because you have no idea what fields are only needed by the frontend. In fact, that set would change over time.> If this were a programming language I would immediately think of row typing to specify the parts that each stage depends on while being agnostic about the rest of the contentIndeed, perhaps one could develop an elaborate system where in the schemas, we could annotate certain fields as being relevant to certain servers. Anywhere else, those fields would be unavailable (but passed through without modification or validation). If you needed the fields in a new place, you change the annotations.But that sounds... complicated to design and cumbersome to maintain the annotations. Simply banning required fields solved the problem for us, and everything else just worked.replynaasking 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Indeed, perhaps one could develop an elaborate system where in the schemas, we could annotate certain fields as being relevant to certain servers. Anywhere else, those fields would be unavailable (but passed through without modification or validation). If you needed the fields in a new place, you change the annotations.I don't think it has to be elaborate. What I was thinking was something more like, in pseudo-C#:// the framework's general channel type from which messages are read public interface IChannel { T Read() where T : interface; }// clients declare the interface they operate on: public interface IClientFields { public int Foo { get; set; } public string? Name { get; set; } } ... // client middleware function Task MiddlewareFn(IChannel chan) { var client = chan.Read(); ... // do something with client before resuming at next stage }The client's interface type T must simply be a structural subtype of the underlying message type. As long as the underlying format is somewhat self-descriptive with a name and type map, you can perform the necessary checking that only applies locally to the client. Nothing fancy, and the required fields that client cares about are still there and the rest are ignored because they're never referenced. This could return an interface that contains a series of offsets into the data stream, which I believe is how capnproto already works.replykentonv 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Are you saying that each service would need to declare, separately, the subset of fields they operate on, and make sure that those fields are always a strict subset of the overall set of fields the protocol contains?This essentially means declaring the same protocol multiple times, which seems like a big pain.replymike_hearn 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's easier to understand in context - some services (iirc web search but it might have been ads or something else very core) had kept adding fields to some core protobufs for years and years. It made sense, was the path of least resistance etc, but inevitably some of those fields became obsolete and they wanted to remove them but found it was hard, because every program that did anything with web search was deserializing these structures.Truly generic middleware like RPC balancers did what you are saying, but there were also a lot of service specific \"middlemen\" which did need to look at parts of these mega-structures.Now due to how protobufs work, you can do what you suggest and \"cast\" a byte stream to multiple different types, so they could have defined subsets of the overall structures and maybe they did, I don't remember, but the issue then is code duplication. You end up defining the same structures multiple times, just as subsets. With a more advanced type system you can eliminate the duplication, but there was a strong reluctance to add features to protobufs.reply3cats-in-a-coat 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Honestly I wonder what is the big win in terms of performance by using static types here, because this sounds so terribly well fit for dynamic types (of which optionality by default is in fact a limited example). Such an odd choice to calcify a spec in a places where it changes all the time. \"Static\" optimizations should be local, not distributed.replymike_hearn 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think you're defining consumer as the literal line of code where the field is read, whereas a more natural definition would be something like \"the moment the data structure is deserialized\". After all it's usually better to abort early than half way through an operation.It was quite realistic to improve protobufs to help dig web search out of their \"everything+dog consumes an enormous monolithic datastructure\" problem, assuming that's what you're thinking of (my memory of the details of this time is getting fuzzy).A simple brute-force fix for their situation would have been to make validation of required fields toggle-able on a per-parse level, so they could disable validation for their own parts of the stack without taking it away for everyone else (none of the projects I worked on had problems with required fields that I can recall).A better fix would have been for protobufs to support composition. They could then have started breaking down the mega-struct into overlapping protos, with the original being defined as a recursive merge of them. That'd have let them start narrowing down semantically meaningful views over what the programs really needed.The worst fix was to remove validation features from the language, thus forcing everyone to manually re-add them without the help of the compiler.Really, the protobuf type system was too simple for Google even in 2006. I recall during training wondering why it didn't have a URL type given that this was a web-centric company. Shortly after I discovered a very simple and obvious bug in web search in which some local business results were 404s even though the URL existed. It had been there for months, maybe years, and I found it by reading the user support forums (nobody else did this, my manager considered me way out of my lane for doing so). The bug was that nothing anywhere in the pipeline checked that the website address entered by the business owner started with https://, so when the result was stuffed into antag it turned intoand so the user ended up at https://www.google.com/www.business.com. Oops. These bad strings made it all the way from the business owner, through the LBC frontend, the data pipeline, the intermediate microservices and the web search frontends to the user's browser. The URL did pass crawl validation because when loaded into a URL type, the missing protocol was being added. SREs were trained to do post-mortems, so after it got fixed and the database was patched up, I naively asked whether there was a systematic fix for this, like maybe adding a URL type to protobufs so data would be validated right at the start. The answer was \"it sounds like you're asking how to not write bugs\" and nothing was done, sigh. It's entirely possible that similar bugs reoccurred dozens of times without being detected.Those are just a couple of cases where the simplicity (or primitivity) of the protobuf type system led to avoidable problems. Sure, there are complexity limits too, but the actual languages Googlers were using all had more sophisticated type systems than protobuf and bugs at the edges weren't uncommon.replykentonv 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I think you're defining consumer as the literal line of code where the field is readI am.> After all it's usually better to abort early than half way through an operation.I realize this goes against common wisdom, but I actually disagree.It's simply unrealistic to imagine that we can fully determine whether an operation will succeed by examining the inputs upfront. Even if the inputs are fully valid, all sorts of things can go wrong at runtime. Maybe a database connection is randomly dropped. Maybe you run out of memory. Maybe the power goes out.So we already have to design our code to be tolerant to random failures in the middle. This is why we try to group our state changes into a single transaction, or design things to be idempotent.Given we already have to do all that, I think trying to validate input upfront creates more trouble than it solves. When your validation code is far away from the code that actually processes the data, it is easier to miss things and harder to keep in sync.To be clear, though, this does not mean I like dynamic typing. Static types are great. But the reason I like them is more because they make programming easier, letting you understand the structure of the data you're dealing with, letting the IDE implement auto-complete, jump-to-definition, and error checking, etc.Consider TypeScript, which implements static typing on JavaScript, but explicitly does not perform any runtime checks whatsoever validating types. It's absolutely possible that a value at runtime does not match the type that TypeScript assigned to it. The result is a runtime exception when you try to access the value in a way that it doesn't support (even though its type says it should have). And yet, people love TypeScript, it clearly provides value despite this.This stuff makes a programming language theorist's head explode but it practice it works. Look, anything can be invalid in ways you never thought of, and no type system can fully defend you from that. You gotta get comfortable with the idea that exceptions might be thrown from anywhere, and design systems to accommodate failure.replyDylan16807 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Consider TypeScript, which implements static typing on JavaScript, but explicitly does not perform any runtime checks whatsoever validating types.

Look, anything can be invalid in ways you never thought of, and no type system can fully defend you from that. You gotta get comfortable with the idea that exceptions might be thrown from anywhere, and design systems to accommodate failure.It's only possible if you're doing something wrong type-wise. In particular, when ingesting an object you're supposed to validate it before/as you assign the type to it. Delaying the error until the particular field is accessed is bad TypeScript! Those kinds of exceptions aren't supposed to be thrown from anywhere.replymike_hearn 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I agree with a lot of this, but:1. The advantage of having it in the type system is the compiler can't forget.2. It's quite hard to unwind operations in C++. I think delaying validation to the last moment is easier when you have robust exceptions. At the top level the frameworks can reject RPCs or return a 400 or whatever it is you want to do, if it's found out 20 frames deep into some massive chunk of code then you're very likely to lose useful context as the error gets unwound (and worse error messages).On forgetting, the risky situation is something like this:message FooRequest { required string query = 1; optional list options = 2; // added later }The intention is: in v1 of the message there's some default information returned, but in v2 the client is given more control including the ability to return less information as well as more. In proto2 you can query if options is set, and if not, select the right default value. In proto3 you can't tell the difference between an old client and a client that wants no extra information returned. That's a bug waiting to happen: the difference between \"not set\" and \"default value\" is important. Other variants are things like adding \"int32 timeout\" where it defaults to zero, or even just having a client that forgets to set a required field by mistake.TypeScript does indeed not do validation of type casts up front, but that's more because it's specifically designed to be compatible with JavaScript and the runtime doesn't do strong typing. People like it compared to raw JS.replyskybrian 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think this comes from everyone wanting to use the same schema and parser. For example, a text editor and a compiler have obvious differences in how to deal with invalid programs.Maybe there need to be levels of validation, like \"it's a text file\" versus \"it parses\" versus \"it type checks.\"replymike_hearn 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sure, that would also have been a fine solution. There are lots of ways to tackle it really and some of it is just very subjective. There's a lot of similarities here between the NoSQL vs SQL debates. Do you want a schemaless collection of JSON documents or do you want enforced schemas, people can debate this stuff for a long time.You can also see it as a version control and awareness problem rather than a schema or serialization problem. The issues don't occur if you always have full awareness of what code is running and what's consuming what data, but that's hard especially when you take into account batch jobs.replysaghm 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > The argument is actually more like: don't use badly written middleman software that tries to parse messages it doesn't need to parse.> I was at Google when the \"let's get rid of optional\" crusade started.

It sounds like either having the message bus _just_ process the header and not the entire message or having the header have a version number that indicated which fields are required (with versions numbers that are newer than the latest the bus was aware of being considered to have no required fields). I don't claim that it's never correct to design a protocol optimizing for robustness when consumed by poorly written clients, but I similarly struggle to see how making that the only possible way to implement a protocol is the only valid option. Maybe the goal of cap'n proto is to be prescriptive about this sort of thing, so it wouldn't be a good choice for uses where there's more rigor in the implementation of services using the protocol, but if its intended for more general usage, I don't understand this design decision at all.reply3cats-in-a-coat 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's valuable what you say, and it's kinda odd some people here discard practical experience in favor of their subjective flavor of theoretical correctness.replylanstin 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The distributed part shifts the problem from \"find types that represent your solution\" to \"find a system of types that enable evolution of your solution over time.\" I think this is why bad things like json or xml do so well: they work fine with a client dev saying, \"I need this extra data\" and the server dev adding it, and then the client dev consuming it.The more modern approaches, like protobuf or capn proto are designed with the experience of mutating protocols over time.It works pretty well too unless the new field changes the semantics of old field values, e.g. adding a field \"payment_is_reversal_if_set\" to a payment info type, which would change the meaning of the signs of the amounts. In that case, you have to reason more explicitly about when to roll out the protocol readers and when to roll out the protocol writers. Or version it, etc.replyinsanitybit 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Can't we extend this argument to eliminating basically all static typing?No, because static typing exists in all sorts of places. This argument is primarily about cases where you're exchanging data, which is a very specific use case.replyklabb3 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] To elaborate on your point:Static type systems in programming languages are designed to break at compilation-time. The reason this works is because all users are within the same “program unit”, on the same version.In other words, static typing allows more validation to be automated, and removes the need for multiple simultaneous versions, but assumes that the developer has access and ability to change all other users at the same “time” of their own change.I find this whole topic fascinating. It seems like programmers are limited to an implicit understanding of these differences but it’s never formalized (or even properly conceptualized). Thus, our intuition often fails with complex systems (eg multiple simultaneous versions, etc). Case in point: even mighty Google distinguished engineers made this “billion-dollar mistake” with required fields, even though they had near-perfect up-front knowledge of their planned use-cases.replymike_hearn 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's actually the opposite. The billion dollar mistake is to have pervasive implicit nullability, not to have the concept of optionality in your type system. Encoding optionality in the type system and making things required by default is usually given as the fix for the billion dollar mistake.replyklabb3 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Huh? Did you read the link, from the guy who was there during the major failure at Google that led to proto3 being redesigned without that flaw?The whole lesson is that you can’t apply the lessons from static type systems in PLs when you have multiple versions and fragmented validation across different subsystems. Counter-intuitively! Everyone thought it was a good idea, and it turned out to be a disaster.reply3cats-in-a-coat 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It remains a big asterisk to me, why was some random middleware validating an end-to-end message between two systems, instead of treating it as just an opaque message.Why are we not having this debate about \"everything must be optional\" for Internet Packets (IP) for example?

If you want to ensure integrity you checksum the binary load.replyklabb3 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Things like distributed tracing, auth data, metrics, error logging messages and other “meta-subsystems” is certainly typical use cases.

The idea is you have no \"pre-burned\" static types, but dynamic types. And static types then become a disposable optimization compiled out of more dynamic code, in the same way JIT works in V8 and JVM for example (where type specialization is in fact part of the optimization strategy).replyinsanitybit 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You're describing dynamic typesreply3cats-in-a-coat 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But with the benefit of static types, and without the drawbacks of static types.replyinsanitybit 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No. \"Types only known at runtime\" are dynamic types. \"And also you can optimize by examining the types at runtime\" is just dynamic types. And it does not have the benefit of static types because it is dynamic types.reply3cats-in-a-coat 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is devolving into a \"word definition war\" so I'll leave aside what you call static types and dynamic types and get down to specifics. Type info is available in these flavors, relative to runtime:1. Type info which is available before runtime, but not at runtime (compiled away).2. Type info which is available at runtime, but not at compile time (input, statistics, etc.).3. Type info which is available both at compile time and runtime (say like a Java class).When you have a JIT optimizer that can turn [3] and [2] into [1], there's no longer a reason to have [1], except if you're micro-optimizing embedded code for some device with 64kb RAM or whatever. We've carried through legacy practices, and we don't even question them, and try to push them way out of their league into large-scale distributed software.When I say we don't need [1], this doesn't mean I deny [3], which is still statically analyzable type information. It's static types, but without throwing away flexibility and data at runtime, that doesn't need to be thrown away.replyinsanitybit 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Short of time travel one can not turn (3) or (2) into (1). I'm not sure where the confusion here is or what you're advocating for because this isn't making sense to me.> there's no longer a reason to have [1]I guess if you're assuming the value of static types is just performance? But it's not, not by a long shot - hence 'mypy', a static typechecker that in no way impacts runtime.I think this conversation is a bit too confusing for me so I'm gonna respectfully walk away :)reply3cats-in-a-coat 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The confusion is to assume \"runtime\" is statically defined. JIT generates code which omits type information that's determined not to be needed in the context of the compiled method/trace/class/module. That code still \"runs\" it's \"runtime\".replyinsanitybit 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, the types that JIT omits are dynamic types.replymrkeen 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's up to you.It's easy to imagine any statically typed language having a general-purpose JSON type.

In a RPC context that might even be fine, but in a message queue...I will never use Avro again on a MQ. I also found the schema resolution mechanism anemic.Avro was (is?) popular on Kafka, but it is such a bad fit that Confluent created a whole additional piece of infra called Schema Registry [1] to make it work. For Protobuf and JSON schema, it's 90% useless and sometimes actively harmful.I think you can also embed the schema in an Avro message to solve this, but then you add a massive amount of overhead if you send individual messages.[1] https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/i...replyinsanitybit 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > but it is such a bad fit that Confluent created a whole additional piece of infra called Schema Registry [1] to make it work.That seems like a weird way to describe it. It is assumed that a schema registry would be present for something like Avro. It's just how it's designed - the assumption with Avro is that you can share your schemas. If you can't abide by that don't use it.replydtech 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I do not think its unfair at all. Schema registry needs to add a wrapper and UUID to an Avro payload for it to work, so at the very least Avro as-is is unsuitable for a MQ like Kafka since you cannot use it efficiently without some out-of-band communication channel.replyinsanitybit 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Everyone knows you need an out of band channel for it, I don't know why you're putting this out there like it's a fault instead of how it's designed. Whether it's RPC where you can deploy your services or a schema registry, that is literally just how it works.Wrapping a message with its schema version so that you can look up that version is a really sensible way to go. A uuid is way more than what's needed since they could have just used a serial integer but whatever, that's on Kafka for building it that way, not Avro.replymorelisp 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > a serial integerAnd now you can't trivially port your data between environments.replyinsanitybit 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Can you elaborate?

With Avro you cannot read the message.replynly 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I mean a schema registry solves this problem, and you just put the schema in to the registry before the software is released.A simpler option is to just publish the schema in to the queue periodically. Say every 30 seconds, and then receivers can cache schemas for message types they are interested in.replythrowboatyface 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Disagree. Avro makes messages slightly smaller by removing tags, but it makes individual messages completely incomprehensible without the writer schema. For serializing data on disk it's fine and a reasonable tradeoff to save space, but for communication on the wire tagged formats allow for more flexibility on the receiver end.The spec for evolving schemas is also full of ambiguity and relies on the canonical Java implementation. I've built an Avro decoder from scratch and some of the evolution behaviour is counter-intuitive.replykentonv 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Exchanging schemas at the beginning of a connection handshake is hardly burdensome.I dunno, that sounds extremely burdensome to me, especially if the actual payload is small.And how exactly does exchanging schemas solve the problem? If my version of the schema says this field is required but yours says it is optional, and so you don't send it, what am I supposed to do?replydtech 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Avro makes that case slightly better because you can default value for a missing field in one of the two schemas and then it works.It's not worth the boatload of problems it bring in all other and normal use cases though.

It also makes the bus factor and longevity story very poor. Simplicity rules.replycmrdporcupine 16 hours ago | parent | next [–] Part of the problem with cap'n'proto whenever I've approached it is that not only does it have an opinion on how to architect your server (fine, whatever) but in C++ it ends up shipping with its own very opinionated alternative to the STL (\"KJ\") and when I played with it some years ago it really ended up getting its fingers everywhere and was hard to work into an existing codebase.The Rust version also comes with its own normative lifestyle assumptions; many of which make sense in the context of its zero-copy world but still make a lot of things hard to express, and the documentation was hard to parse.I tend to reach for flatbuffers instead, for this reason alone.Still I think someday I hope to have need and use for cap'n'proto; or at least finish one of several hobby projects I've forked off to try to use it over the years. There's some high quality engineering there.replykentonv 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, it's true, the C++ implementation has become extremely opinionated.I didn't initially intend for KJ to become as all-encompassing as it has. I guess I kept running into things that didn't work well about the standard library, so I'd make an alternative that worked well, but then other parts of the standard library would not play nicely with my alternative, so it snowballed a bit.At the time the project started, C++11 -- which completely changed the language -- was brand new, and the standard library hadn't been updated to really work well with the new features.The KJ Promise library in particular, which made asynchronous programming much nicer using the newly-introduced lambdas, predated any equivalent landing in the standard library by quite a bit. This is probably the most opinionated part of KJ, hardest to integrate with other systems. (Though KJ's even loop does actually have the ability to sit on top of other event loops, with some effort.)And then I ended up with a complete ecosystem of libraries on top of Promises, like KJ HTTP.With the Workers Runtime being built entirely in that ecosystem, it ends up making sense for me to keep improving that ecosystem, rather than try to make things work better across ecosystems... so here we are.replycmrdporcupine 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Oh I understand completely how that would happen.

Based on asynchronous promises and grounded in capabilities.You don't have to use it. You could just use it just as a 'serialization' layer but if you're writing services you could be missing half the advantage, really. And if you're writing in C++ you'll end up having to use their KJ library anyways.If you take the whole package the zero copy, capability-security, and asynchrouny (a word I just coined!) all fit together nicely.replyinsanitybit 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah I'm aware of all of that. What I'm saying is that I don't see what about the Schema Definition Language pushes you towards the RPC other than that they obviously go well together, just like gRPC is almost always used with protobuf, or http with JSON.> but it bothers me that what is ultimately a message encoding protocol has an opinion on how I should architect my server.To me, this is like saying \"Using JSON is unfortunate because it has an opinion that I should use HTTP\" when I don't think anyone would argue that at all, and I don't see the argument for capnp much either.replykentonv 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The main thing that Cap'n Proto PRC really requires about the serialization is that object references are a first-class type. That is, when you make an RPC, the parameters or results can contain references to new, remote RPC objects. Upon receiving such a reference, that object is now callable.Making this work nicely requires some integration between the serialization layer and the RPC layer, though it's certainly possible to imagine Protobuf being extended with some sort of hooks for this.replyajkjk 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Asynchrony?replyinsanitybit 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] Any plans to improve the Rust side of things?

This is interesting, actually. When originally designing Cap'n Proto, I was convinced by a capabilities expert I talked to that cancellation should be considered dangerous, because software that isn't expecting it might be vulnerable to attacks if cancellation occurs at an unexpected place. Especially in a language like C++, which lacks garbage collection or borrow checking, you might expect use-after-free to be a big issue. I found the argument compelling.In practice, though, I've found the opposite: In a language with explicit lifetimes, and with KJ's particular approach to Promises (used to handle async tasks in Cap'n Proto's C++ implementation), cancellation safety is a natural side-effect of writing code to have correct lifetimes. You have to make cancellation safe because you have to cancel tasks all the time when the objects they depend on are going to be destroyed. Moreover, in a fault-tolerant distributed system, you have to assume any code might not complete, e.g. due to a power outage or maybe just throwing an unexpected exception in the middle, and you have to program defensively for that anyway. This all becomes second-nature pretty quick.So all our code ends up cancellation-safe by default. We end up with way more problems from cancellation unexpectedly being prevented when we need it, than happening when we didn't expect it.EDIT: Re-reading, maybe you were referring to the breaking changes slated for 2.0. But those are primarily changes to the KJ toolkit library, not Cap'n Proto, and is all about API design... I'd say API design is not a constrained problem.replyTimothycquinn 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] Congrats in 10 years!

To be honest I wouldn't recommend Capnp. The C++ API is very awkward.The zero copy parsing is less of a benefit than you'd expect - pretty unlikely you're going to want to keep your data as a Capnp data structure because of how awkward it is to use. 99% of the time you'll just copy it into your own data structures anyway.There's also more friction with the rest of the world which has more or less settled on Protobuf as the most popular binary implementation of this sort of idea.I only used it for serialisation. Maybe the RPC stuff is more compelling.I really wish Thrift had taken off instead of Protobuf/gRPC. It was so much better designed and more flexible than anything I've seen before or since. I think it died mainly due to terrible documentation. I guess it also didn't have a big name behind it.replykentonv 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] I do agree that the API required for zero-copy turns out a bit awkward, particularly on the writing side. The reading side doesn't look much different. Meanwhile zero-copy is really only a paradigm shift in certain scenarios, like when used with mmap(). For network communications it doesn't change much unless you are doing something hardcore like RDMA. I've always wanted to add an optional alternative API to Cap'n Proto that uses \"plain old C structures\" (or something close to it) with one-copy serialization (just like protobuf) for the use cases where zero-copy doesn't really matter. But haven't gotten around to it yet...That said I personally have always been much more excited about the RPC protocol than the serialization. I think the RPC protocol is actually a paradigm shift for almost any non-trivial use case.replyfoobiekr 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] One thing about google proto is that, at least in many languages, every message throws off a ton of garbage that stresses the GC. On the send side, you can obviously re-use objects, but on the receive side no.replyhaberman 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] More and more languages are being built on top of the \"upb\" C library for protobuf (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb) which is designed around arenas to avoid this very problem.Currently Ruby, PHP, and Python are backed by upb.Disclosure: I work on the protobuf team, and created the upb library.replyfoobiekr 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agreed but please do something about Go.replytignaj 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is also because Google's Protobuf implementations aren't doing a very good job with avoiding unnecessary allocations. Gogoproto is better and it is possible to do even better, here is an example prototype I have put together for Go (even if you do not use the laziness part it is still much faster than Google's implementation): https://github.com/splunk/exp-lazyprotoreplycmrdporcupine 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I've always been excited about zero copy messages in the context of its potential in database systems; the thought of tuples working their way all the way from btree nodes in a pager, to query results on the network without copies seems fantastic.But every time I've tried to prototype or implement around this model I've run into conceptual blocks. It's a tricky paradigm to fully wrap one's head around, and to squeeze into existing toolsets.replymgaunard 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You mean flatbuffers, not protobuf.It has established itself as the de-facto standard, with a few other places using SBE instead.In any case the main problems with binary serialization are:- schemas and message version management- delta-encodingIf you ignore these, flat binary serialization is trivial.No library provides a good solution that covers the two points above.replykentonv 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What part of the industry are you in where flatbuffers is seen as the de facto standard? Personally I've never randomly encountered a project using flatbuffers. I see protobuf all the time.(I've randomly run into Cap'n Proto maybe 2-3 times but to be fair I'm probably more likely to notice that.)replyynx 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] As of the last time I was close, flatbuffer usage is or was near ubiquitous for use in FB's (ha ha, go figure) mobile apps, across Android and iOS at least.replycmrdporcupine 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Flatbuffers seems to have penetration in the games industry. And it sounds like from other posters that Facebook uses it.I recently started a job doing work on autonomy systems that run in tractors, and was surprised to see we use it (flatbuffers) in the messaging layer (in both C++ and Rust)replydtech 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Protobuf is very widely used, I just had to Google flatbuffers...replyRapzid 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I find MessagePack to be pretty great if you don't need schema. JSON serialization is unreasonably fast in V8 though and even message pack can't beat it; though it's often faster in other languages and saves on bytes.replyalfalfasprout 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Except messagepack is really slow...replyRapzid 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Is it?

We ran comparisons on objects with lots of numbers and arrays (think GeoJSON) and messagepack came out way ahead. Of course, something like Arrow may have fared even better with its focus on columnar data, but we didn't want to venture that far afield just yet.replyc-cube 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Why don't you compare JSON + gzip to msgpack + gzip? That'd be a more fair comparison.replycoder543 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I do not agree that JSON is faster.Encoding JSON or MessagePack will be about the same speed, although I would expect MessagePack to be marginally faster from what I’ve seen over the years. It’s easy to encode data in most formats, compression excluded.Parsing is the real problem with JSON, and no, it isn’t even close. MessagePack knows the length of every field, so it is extremely fast to parse, an advantage that grows rapidly when large strings are a common part of the data in question. I love the simple visual explanation of how MessagePack works here: https://msgpack.org/Anyone who has written parsing code can instantly recognize what makes a format like this efficient to parse compared to JSON.With some seriously wild SIMD JSON parsing libraries, you can get closer to the parsing performance of a format like MessagePack, but I think it is physically impossible for JSON to be faster. You simply have to read every byte of JSON one way or another, which takes time. You also don’t have any ability to pre-allocate for JSON unless you do two passes, which would be expensive to do too. You have no idea how many objects are in an array, you have no idea how long a string will be.MessagePack objects are certainly smaller than JSON but larger than compressed JSON. Even compressed MessagePack objects are larger than the equivalent compressed JSON, in my experience, likely because the field length indicators add a randomness to the data that makes compression less effective.For applications where you need to handle terabytes of data flowing through a pipeline every hour, MessagePack can be a huge win in terms of cost due to the increased CPU efficiency, and it’s a much smaller lift to switch to MessagePack from JSON than to switch to something statically typed like Protobuf or CapnProto, just due to how closely MessagePack matches JSON. (But, if you can switch to Protobuf or CapnProto, those should yield similar and perhaps even modestly better benefits.)Compute costs are much higher than storage costs, so I would happily take a small size penalty if it reduced my CPU utilization by a large amount, which MessagePack easily does for applications that are very data-heavy. I’m sure there is at least one terribly slow implementation of MessagePack out there somewhere, but most of them seem quite fast compared to JSON.Some random benchmarks in Go: https://github.com/shamaton/msgpack#benchmarkAlso take note of the “ShamatonGen” results, which use codegen before compile time to do things even more efficiently for types known ahead of time, compared to the normal reflection-based implementation. The “Array” results are a weird version that isn’t strictly comparable, the encoding and decoding steps assume that the fields are in a fixed order, so the encoded data is just arrays of values, and no field names. It can be faster and more compact, but it’s not “normal” messagepack.I’ve personally seen crazy differences in performance vs JSON.If you’re not handling a minimum of terabytes of JSON per day, then the compute costs from JSON are probably irrelevant and not worth thinking too hard about, but there can be other benefits to switching away from JSON.replyRapzid 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Size savings depends I guess on the workload. That home page example gets larger gzip'd so raw msgpack is smaller. Another comment says their data was considerably smaller vs json.Sometimes you can't gzip for various reasons. There were per-message deflate bugs in Safari and Brave somewhat recently. Microsoft is obsessed with the decades old CRIME/BREACH for some reason(I've never heard any other company or individual even mention them) so signalR still doesn't have the compression option yet..replynvarsj 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] fbthrift is still alive and kicking.replyunixhero 14 hours ago | prev | next [–] Congratulations to kentonv and the teamreplyhgsgm 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] Tell me about your uses of capn proto.replybkiran 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] I'm using Cap'N Proto in a message broker application(LcuidMQ) I'm building for serialization.

Seems like they have proven in testing that they can best maximize watch hours (or perhaps renewable) ONLY when the algorithm heavily influences what you watch (and by maximizing the number of exclusive series you start?), so it seems like they hide anything you’re already watching and push all their series at once.replyuncletaco 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I both like and am afraid of a system where you can just continuously flip to the next show or tv series, browsing by clip until you find something interesting and choose to roll back to the beginning of the episode.

The device he's showing apparently spaces out its transmissions 4 channels apart.What I meant by \"near instantaneous\" was that the delays were short enough that I don't recall registering them as \"I'm waiting for this,\" and when started I using digital TVs I registered the channel-switch speed as a noticeable and annoying regression.I guess my point is the simulation has a digitally-slow pause with static, which seems like anachronism with a coat of retro-colored paint.

VHS in general and junk tapes in particular would have been viewed by most people as low value junk that was tempting to disposed of. That's especially true during the decade or two before nostalgia and retro-cool starts making old junk more desirable.3. Tapes degrade. Even if someone kept them, they might not be readable and/or gum up the VCR you're trying to use to read them.4. VHS digitization equipment is also old. Apparently newer capture cards aren't very good compared to older ones, and there are specialized devices to fix signal errors (TBCs), allowing capture cards to actually work, that are becoming hard to find and expensive.5.

Analog TVs would change channels instantly.replyboomboomsubban 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] In my experience, it was fairly common for there to be (as an example) a channel 3 and a channel 5 but no 4, so if you were flipping through the channels on certain TV's you'd see static.replybombela 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Except here, there is static before the content appears on the channel. Which is not the same as stumbling upon an empty channel.Very old TV's did not have memorized channels, and so you had to tune to find the next channel, which would give you a progression to static and back.Then TV had a memory for the channel frequency. It would switch instantaneously the video. So fast that sometimes you could see the first frame in black and white. Then color info would come (color TV is atop of black and white and spread over frames if I recall). Then mono sound would come in. Then stereo (like color, the stereo signal is an augmentation). Still all of that faster than any modern technology.Then came digital TVs (still receiving analog TV signal) which could have a second or two of digital lag during channel change, but it wouldn't display static, simply a blank (dark) screen.replyanthk 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] By the 90s everyone in the Northerhn hemisphere got a decent TV with instant tuning.

The old kind had a manual rotary switch, and you had to move through all intermediate channels regardless of whether a station was broadcasting there, so you could see static when switching.For example, in my area, the main stations were at 4, 5, and 8. Switching from 5 to 4, I'd see no static because they're adjacent. Switching from 5 to 8, I'd see static while the knob was at 6 and 7.The 60s, 70s, and 80s TV sets on the site are the style I'm talking about.

You have over 100 broadcast markets, each of which got their own magazine essentially, but before widespread adoption of ISSN, so even keeping track of which is which is tough. And the supported markets changed over the years too, so even if you figure it out for say 1984, in 1985 it's all mixed up again.Then, most of these are missing. Archive.org's collection is thread-bare. For most calendar dates they only have one, and which market it is for is just random (though, it favors the big ones... California, NYC/NJ, etc).After that, each page of listings is just bad. It's not as easily OCRed as more traditional multi-column magazines. The listings often don't make mention of which episode is being re-run, title only quite often. This affects afternoon cartoons on UHF quite a bit, since they'd do alot of the short film Looney Tunes and Woody Woodpecker. You don't get any information on pre-emption at all. No sports-going-in-to-overtime or President-Reagan-has-an-important-announcement-about-the-commies. Daytime soaps can probably be pieced together just from the date (but that isn't perfect over long stretches and mixups accumulate, the NY Times lost track of their issue number and by the time they noticed they were off by 5000).Hell, I wonder how many different edited-for-tv edits of movies there are, for at least a few there might be more than one because there's more reasons to do it than just bleeping out profanity.replyLeonardoTolstoy 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have a bit of this information.

    "originBody": "NEWS ▼ CONTACT SUBSCRIBE Sci-Hub’s Alexandra Elbakyan Receives EFF Award for Providing Access to Scientific Knowledge yesterday by Ernesto Van der SarHOME > TECHNOLOGY > DIGITAL FREEDOM >The Electronic Frontier Foundation will award Alexandra Elbakyan, founder of the 'pirate' library Sci-Hub, for her efforts to provide access to scientific knowledge. According to EFF, Elbakyan's site is a vital resource for millions of students and researchers. Some medical professionals have even argued that the site helped to save lives.There are thousands of pirate sites on the Internet but only a few will receive a permanent entry in the history books. That includes Sci-Hub.Founded by Kazakhstani computer programmer Alexandria Elbakyan, the shadow library provides free access to millions of academic publications. As such, it’s an essential tool for less privileged students and researchers around the world.Tearing Down Paywalls Since 2011Without Sci-Hub, many academics would be unable to complete their research projects. This all comes at the detriment of the profits of major publishers, but many argue that’s an easy tradeoff to make.Alexandra knows this from experience. She started Sci-Hub after running into accessibility problems more than a decade ago while studying at a less fortunate university.“When I was working on my research project, I found out that all research papers I needed for work were paywalled. I was a student in Kazakhstan at the time and our university was not subscribed to anything,” Alexandra told TorrentFreak years ago.Today, Sci-Hub continues to tear down academic paywalls but that comes at a cost. Sci-Hub has been sued several times and owes millions in damages to major publishers. In addition, Elbakyan also drew the attention of the FBI.Instead of throwing in the towel, Sci-Hub’s founder continues to defend her ideals. They’re a thorn in the side of major publishers, but on the other side of the debate, Elbakyan reaps praise.EFF AwardThis week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) announced that Sci-Hub’s founder will receive an award for her accomplishments in advancing access to scientific knowledge.EFF’s awards are presented to people who have taken a leading role in the fight for freedom and innovation online. The previous winners include Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, Linux creator Linus Torvalds, and whistleblower Chelsea Manning.According to EFF, Elbakyan deserves the award as her life’s work enables millions of people to access scientific knowledge that would otherwise exist beyond their financial reach.“Sci-Hub is used by millions of students, researchers, medical professionals, journalists, inventors, and curious people all over the world, many of whom provide feedback saying they are grateful for this access to knowledge.“Some medical professionals have said Sci-Hub helps save human lives; some students have said they wouldn’t be able to complete their education without Sci-Hub’s help,” EFF adds.The Real Threat?EFF also highlights that Elbakyan’s work helps to challenge the current academic publishing system, where researchers are used as unpaid workhorses.“Through Sci-Hub, Elbakyan has strived to shatter academic publishing’s monopoly-like mechanisms in which publishers charge high prices even though authors of articles in academic journals receive no payment,” EFF writes.Elbakyan previously said that academic publishers are the real threat to the progress of science as they keep scientific progress and findings behind closed doors, instead of sharing knowledge freely as Sci-Hub does.In addition to Elbakyan, the digital rights group will also present awards to the Library Freedom Project and the Signal Foundation for their achievements.‘I Am Sci-Hub’Sci-Hub’s founder is pleased with EFF’s acknowledgment, although the initial plan to give the award to the Sci-Hub website, rather than her personally, wasn’t well received.“It was really disgusting to read they ask me to accept their EFF Pioneer award ‘on behalf of Sci-Hub’,” Elbakyan said in response two weeks before the awards were officially announced.“Why did not they want to give the award to me directly? Sci-Hub is my sole creation; it is not an organization and never had any team. In 1998 they awarded Torvalds, not Linux,” she added.That commentary apparently made EFF reconsider its plan. The award now goes to Elbakyan directly and it will be officially handed out at the awards ceremony in San Francisco this coming September.EFF previously recognized that it may be challenging for Sci-Hub’s founder to attend the ceremony in person, noting that there are secure methods of communication available in case she prefers to accept it virtually instead.Next Post Previous Post Tagged In: Alexandra Elbakyan eff sci-hub You Might Also Like:LAWSUITSSci-Hub Founder’s High Court Creativity Fails to Dismiss Publishers’ Lawsuit February 17, 2023, 10:39 by Andy MaxwellLAWSUITSGitHub and EFF Back YouTube Ripper in Legal Battle With the RIAA February 10, 2023, 18:58 by Ernesto Van der SarPIRACYDomain Registry Takes Sci-Hub’s .SE Domain Name Offline (Updated) January 26, 2023, 13:13 by Ernesto Van der SarSubmit a correction or tip.SPONSORSPOPULAR POSTS Which VPN Providers Really Take Privacy Seriously in 2023?

When both copyrights and patents were invented the longest 'corporate charter' a company could hold was 6 months in total.Patents and Copyrights were designed to aid fledgling businesses in America compete against the behemoth industrial machines of England, Spain, France, and Europe in general. Companies in those countries were expansionist and simply bought out any serious competition.Our country's founders didn't want that system taking hold of American economics, so invented protections against such things occurring here.Remove the copyrights and patents from ANY multinational corporation. If it's not an American-ONLY based company -where money isn't shipped wholesale overseas- then they can no longer enjoy patents or copyrights in America.POOF... problem solved.replyblitzar 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] > Our country's founders didn't want that system taking hold of American economics, so invented protections against such things occurring here.They had zero IP and were building a country on stolen IP, of course they wanted to play fast and loose.Now that the US has IP and others dont, they are doing what they do best, The World Police.replyskeaker 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think you and GP are agreeing.

Not that the MPA or John Deere would’ve respected the EFF anyway, but I’m sure it’s going to be mentioned in future court cases as a way to discredit the arguments.replypessimizer 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] I care far more about the availability of scientific publications than about producers putting DRM on their own products.The thing I'm against is the government telling me that I can't strip DRM.

BAILEY& NICK ALMOND / JULY 26, 2023 11:02 AMMidjourney modified by BlockworksSHAREWorldcoin — a new financial system connected to sensitive biometric information, mostly harvested from poor people — sure sounds like a terrible idea.“Terrible” doesn’t do it justice.Worldcoin will need to assemble a vast database of iris data. But not everyone is eager to gaze into an Orb. In the bootstrapping phase, at least, you had to pay people to scan their eyes. And so Worldcoin turned to the global south — home to the cheapest eyeballs — and played a dark game of ‘what will people do for money?’Incredibly, Worldcoin was unprepared for an obvious consequence of this rollout strategy: A black market for verified credentials. You can now seemingly buy a World ID for as little as $30. Anyone, then, with more than $30 on hand can command more than one digital identity (although Worldcoin is aware of this issue and has proposed solutions to resolve it). Connecting real people to digital identities is a thorny puzzle. Worldcoin does not fix this. And it’s unlikely it ever can, since nothing in the design can stop professional sybil attackers farming eyeballs on the ground level through nefarious means.This does not inspire trust in the system or its designers. And yet trust is what they demand. Worldcoin’s promotional materials are full of promises — to delete sensitive biometric information, or keep it hidden from view, or not use it in nefarious ways. One blog post (quoted here; the original appears to have been changed since initial release) put it this way: “During our field-testing phase, we are collecting and securely storing more data than we will upon its completion… We will delete all the biometric data we have collected during field testing once our algorithms are fully-trained.”“Trust us,” in other words. “We’ll totally delete the eyeball database.”But when it comes to sensitive information, promises aren’t enough. And the very people who insist that you trust them are the ones who should command the most suspicion. The fact that Worldcoin’s co-founder Sam Altman also heads up OpenAI — a firm currently being sued over allegations of dubious uses of large data sets — asks more questions than it answers.Sometimes Worldcoin’s privacy promises are conjoined with dazzling technical details. Zero-knowledge proofs, we’re told, will save the day, and allow users to prove humanity without connecting any particular financial activity to a World ID or other associated transactions.There’s a grain of truth here. Zero-knowledge proofs can generate impressive privacy guarantees. But in the case of Worldcoin marketing, they’re more theater than substance. Taking off your shoes at the airport makes it look like important precautions are being taken (but doesn’t actually make you any safer); and long blog posts about zero-knowledge proofs distract from, but don’t in fact address, the problem of Worldcoin asking for users’ trust.Linking immutable biometric traits to money could have dystopian consequences.Imagine that your digital identity has been lost in some way — shut down by authorities for non-compliance, or otherwise blocked. With traditional cash — and other cryptocurrencies — you can always make a new wallet and stash some fresh coins in it. But this isn’t Minority Report, and you can’t get a new iris from your neighborhood surgeon. When your immutable digital identity is locked — imagine merchants who won’t take your coins from you without a digital signature announcing your World ID — it’s over for you. No old account. No new account. No soup for you. You just lost your digital personhood.Boosters might reply that, thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, one could prove that a given transaction is associated with a valid World ID without disclosing which World ID that is — thus reducing the risk of total identity blockade. But this reply misses the point. Zero-knowledge proofs could be used in benign ways or to preserve user privacy. Or authorities could demand more; they could demand that users reveal all, or be locked out altogether. Setting up a system and simply hoping its full powers of surveillance and control won’t be used is naive, at best.Dystopian premise… dystopian premine?Worldcoin is billed as a network “owned by everyone.” Early promotional materials claim giving “every person on the planet an equal share of a new cryptocurrency” as a premise of the project. It sounds laudable. But a glance at the actual plan for distributing tokens casts doubt on whether equal distribution is an aim of the project at all, much less one it will achieve.It’s a curious ‘world’ coin that isn’t even available in the United States, Turkey, Sudan, or China. And if equal distribution is a goal, allocating a significant chunk of all the tokens that will ever exist to insiders is another curious choice. Early documentation put that insider number at twenty percent; it’s now slated to be at least twenty-five. Who are these insiders? It’s some combination of Worldcoin developers and their partners, Orb operators (with signup bonuses that exhibit a pyramid-like structure), and a slate of (in)famous investors including Sam Bankman-Fried and Three Arrows Capital. Such self-dealing is not the plan one would expect, to put the point mildly, from an operation with genuine egalitarian ambitions.Read more from our opinion section: Worldcoin hackable by cutting off someone’s face, draping it over your ownNow that Worldcoin has launched, we know a bit more about how token distribution will work. It is not entirely reassuring.There’s a well-known crypto trick; they call it a “Sam Coin” (yes, after that Sam). The idea is to release into circulation a very small percentage of all the tokens that will ever exist. Despite low liquidity and trading volume, some eye-popping fully diluted market cap numbers can result, which make for great marketing and creative accounting.Worldcoin — much like MAPS, a notorious crypto dud — is a Sam Coin.About one percent of the ten billion Worldcoin tokens that will ever exist are in circulation, mostly in the hands of market makers partnered with Worldcoin. And yet Worldcoin’s fully diluted market cap, at the time of writing, is somewhere around twenty billion dollars. It’s a great setup to attract speculative retail investors. And those market maker insiders, furthermore, have a deal that guarantees them access to tokens at a fixed price. Their profits are secure. The result is a market structure primed for manipulation and pump and dump dynamics — familiar to anyone who’s paid much attention to crypto.Worldcoin is no radical new financial system, and certainly not one aimed at equality or fairness. It’s just more of the same, but with extra data harvesting steps.Do not look into the Orb.Andrew M.

If you trust their orb, it generates a wallet for you - but anyone, human or otherwise - can use that wallet. There's a black market in China for these identities already [1] and of course the response from Worldcoin was there's nothing they can do - because there's nothing they can do.So this is just any other coin with extra steps, and the extra layer of trusting Sam Altman with your eyeballs to generate secret keys?[1] https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/24/black-market-for-...replyarketyp 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] It's funny how, in the end, the ultimate and perhaps only proof of personhood is being a person, engaged in the world. Sort of how the ultimate decentralized currency is encompassed in the global market of rising and falling economic powers. The oracle problem is a problem because there are no oracles. There is only the test of time. Or something along that line.replyEthanHeilman 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > the ultimate and perhaps only proof of personhood is being a person, engaged in the worldI buy this.Daniel Suarez had a very similar idea, although he referred to it as the bot problem[0]. I believe this approach of identities withstanding \"the test of time\" solves the oracle problem but at the cost of a delayed solution. Initially you have lots and lots of bots and Sybil attacks are common. Then after a while, identities/nyms that exist and interact with the world increase in trustworthiness. Trustworthy identities will eventually be stolen or sold to bad actors, but like fake identities today they will be expensive.My identity on hackernews is over 11 years old. Creating such an identity with the comment history, connection to a true name, and content over 11 years would be very expensive. Likely more expensive that a fake passport.For instance Islamic State terrorists were buying counterfeit passports allowing them to enter the EU for 15,000 USD [1].The major downside of such a system is that isolated people or people with few resources would be at a major disadvantage and we would essentially be replicating much of inequality of the credit score system.[0]: Daemon: Bot-mediated Reality, Daniel Suarez, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS5i1S8FXno[1]: \"One such network, run by an Uzbek with extremist links living in Turkey, is now selling high-quality fake passports for up to $15,000 (£11,132) purporting to be from various countries.

You might get some OK comments with ChatGPT and a stray upvote here and there, but I think you're more likely to get banned if you employ ChatGPT to write your HN comments at any significant volume.Not that everyone writes great comments, all the time, but I'm arguing you probably won't break into the 1000s of HN karma if you try to automate it (because you'll probably get shadowbanned first)replyfossuser 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Keybase was sort of trying to do this with social proof, though it's reliance on a centralized provider (keybase itself) made it brittle.I think you can get there with something like Urbit IDs that are easy to ban. If IDs are not infinite you can some protection against abuse - pairing that with some proof-of-humanity and you can get closer, but there are still issues of someone doing the proof and then selling their ID to a bot. At least if it's easy to ban you can try to make that not economical. Doubly true if the IDs have a non-zero (but low) cost.Helps make you resistant to a sybil attack: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attackThe problem isn't trivial though - it's not obvious what will work best and it'll likely always be somewhat of an arms race, especially if you want to keep privacy.replyineptech 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Keybase was sort of trying to do this with social proof, though it's reliance on a centralized provider (keybase itself) made it brittle.I think something like this could've worked, which is why I was so sad over its demise. I think Keybase (like the MIT PGP keyring, which it is sort of a fancier version of) was predicated on the idea that it's much easier to build a centralized keyring and then decentralize it once it's widely adopted than to build a decentralized keyring from the ground up.replyWorldMaker 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That did seem to be the direction Keybase was exploring. Their merkle trees weren't properly decentralized but hinted at ways that they could be.I'm curious where Keybase would have gone if they were better incentivized to explore that before its demise.replyAlex3917 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Daniel Suarez had a very similar idea, although he referred to it as the bot problemI also wrote about almost the exact same thing as what Worldcoin is doing back in 2006:https://www.alexkrupp.com/fourwebs.htmlAs proof of the original publication date, not only is it in the Wayback Machine, but it's also cited in several academic papers and books.

Creating such an identity with the comment history, connection to a true name, and content over 11 years would be very expensive. Likely more expensive that a fake passport.You can buy very old accounts on any platform for very cheap. Like under $100 for a 10 year account on a popular platform cheap. Most platforms offer comment editing, and most people don't archive everyone else's profiles nor do they have access to the database to check for consistent changes.Meaning that if we use your account for example, if someone bought it from you (or it was hacked after inactivity and you don't care for it, etc), they could easily rewrite what they need to paint the picture that your user isn't actually about using your real name, but a pseudonym. Most aren't going to care about this that far anyways, as usernames are easily ignored on most sites, same with comment histories. Just indicating how easy it is to rewrite both of those aspects.The only platforms where this would be difficult are platforms that already partake in substantial identity verification like Facebook.replyklyrs 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] On HN you can only edit comments until they're 2h old, only delete them until somebody responds. Editing history as you've described would require admin privileges. Good luck getting that for $100.replygochi 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This assumes that platforms never change policies and that admin privileges are expensive and impenetrable. Neither are true, as we've already witnessed multiple times now across various platforms.replyklyrs 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, it doesn't. I'm not speaking of \"platforms.\" I'm speaking of exactly one platform that has an extremely small admin crew. Buying your way to a rewritten history on HN is highly implausible. Hacking, perhaps, but I'd expect that this community has been rattling those doors for the platform's entire existence.replysebzim4500 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Ok so if I make 1000 LLM controlled AIs right now, then in 10 years I can sell them for millions?Sounds like a great system, let's do it.replyApofis 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don’t know if many people read other users comment history or heck even their user names.replyunderlipton 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even that's a bit of a crapshoot. I have a Reddit account that's over 15 years old. I have a Neopets account that's over 20. I can't get into either of them, a consequence of (my abuse of) poor UX design. (What's the fake birth date I chose in 2000? Who knows! Was taking advantage of Reddit's account-juicing tactic of not requiring an email worth losing a decade-old identity to hackers? Probably not!)I've tried to recover them, and faced a (perhaps justified) customer support brick wall. Was Neopets to anticipate Millennial nostalgia (and our preteen willingness to circumvent COPPA) in their sign-up processes a generation ago? How obligated is Reddit to investigate someone's claim to any single account?But without those accounts, I'm two closer to being a digital non-entity, for significant portions of my life.replybrnt 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] People still don't understand the 'this is not a pipe' painting...replylatexr 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I keep coming back to Scott McCloud’s spread in Understanding Comics.https://web.archive.org/web/20220819061912/https://i1.wp.com...The whole book is fantastic.

They never represent reality correctly, but they can be useful.There is a chain of complexity where subatomic wavicles assemble into atoms, molecules, self-reproducing molecules, cells, multicellular life, specialized multicellular life, different clades of life, and on up to forms of intelligence and self-awareness.It is not possible for a human-equivalent intelligence to maintain continuous awareness of all these levels of complexity, and so we operate, much of the time, in abstractions and metaphors that we mistake for being real. We code-switch, consciously and not, through sets of behaviors that pretend that various abstractions are real.Among these abstractions: a town is a group of buildings and people, but different social abstractions don't have to agree about the contents. So the post office, the street maps, the police and the real estate agents can all be simultaneously in disagreement about the house where the author lives in terms of their mappings of \"towns\" and \"jurisdictions\", yet all agree on the street address and which building they mean.When you can't do something because it's illegal, you can do it, but you know that various social institutions will attempt to inflict various consequences on you if they become aware of your action in the appropriate ways. But most of the time you just say \"I can't\" and fall back on \"I shouldn't\".There's a lot more, but it's about the same: we build lots of maps, we don't agree on them, but we keep acting as though they were real even though we know that they aren't. When someone is invested enough in their current map, they can become very upset with someone who points out that it's fictional.replycolordrops 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I never realized that painting was at the LA county museum of art until I was standing face to face with it.

Think conjoined twins (sharing a brain), disabled people, people in coma, long memory loss and all other edge cases.replyanileated 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The proof of humanhood is being made of meat, and that is what Sam Altman went after.The mistake he made is adding blockchain and crypto to that physical verification.replyjerf 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In the end, even that is an approximation. We want to limit our services to \"humans\" because humans can spend money, and humans can only put so much content into our services (spamming limited versus a bot), and humans want to talk to humans, maybe humans only want to date humans, etc.But if there was a bot that was well behaved (for whatever that means for a given service), and somehow legitimately viewed ads, and could legitimately decide to buy something with real money from an ad, there's a lot of sites that would no longer want to ban that particular bot. Now they need to distinguish between that bot and the other \"bad\" bots. In general, if a bot can \"behave well\" we don't necessarily want to kick them out just for being bots.In the end, the more bots become like humans and humans through things like the Mechanical Turk become more like bots, service providers will be required to very carefully think through what it is they actually want to demand of their users. Splitting people into \"human\" and \"bot\" is already only an approximation on the grounds that there's plenty of humans services don't want around, and there's already some bots that services are fine with (e.g., some helpful reddit bots), so that split isn't going to be good enough. The process of thinking through what is really desirable at a much higher level of detail will be fun to watch, and there will be a lot of different answers for different services.replyanileated 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For your service maybe certain humans don’t qualify and maybe certain bots qualify. However, the matter at hand and WC purpose is proof of humanhood in particular.replykmeisthax 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >perhaps only proof of personhood is being a person, engaged in the world.Not even. People have been having double-lives for a lot longer than we've had the Internet. The difference is that in physical space it's a lot harder to do so, because you can only be in one place at one time and you have to move from place to place rather than teleporting. So if you want to catch someone in the act of, say, voting twice, you just need to trace their movements.That being said, there are also plenty of situations in which we consider having multiple identities online to be a good thing. Facebook's \"real name\" policy - forcing everyone to tie themselves to a government issued legal name instead of just a consistent one - was and is cancer. The whole industry of V-Tubers literally runs on talent living a double life and a healthy dose of kayfabe. And we don't yell at character actors because Robert Downey Jr. is also Iron Man.Anonymity is considered a vital bedrock of liberal values. But so is voting, and this is where being able to create additional identities becomes a problem very quickly.Wikipedia has an interesting problem of \"ripened socks\" where people will register multiple accounts and keep them in reserve, specifically to defeat accusations of sock puppeting. This can be detected, but it's murky - are you actually a sock puppet, or do you just lurk Wikipedia a lot[0]? You could probably even go further and split your editing history across multiple sock puppets. Statistical analysis might be able to reveal that, say, two accounts tend to edit the same set of articles, but that would also have a high false positive rate and disenfranchise other editors.The underlying base assumptions of the crypto crowd is a sort of extreme para-identitarianism. Anti-identitarianism in its extreme would be something like Japanese-style imageboards[1], with their obsession over anonymous posting. Identitarianism would be Facebook's real name policy. Paraidentitarianism instead wants identity to be a side effect of resource scarcity. An identity like a signing key is non-scarce, I can just make more keys, so you cannot hold elections by simply counting the signing keys. But the money in your Bitcoin wallet is a paraidentity: it is provable scarcity, and thus can be bent into a sort of identity, at the expense of disenfranchising everyone who has not bought into the system. In fact, crypto hucksters explicitly threaten people who do not buy their coins of being left out of their future utopia.[0] I am in this situation[1] 2channel, Futaba, 4chan, etcreplysorokod 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Almost by definition, everything else is a low resolution replica which is inevitably open to be exploited.replyjstummbillig 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What an interesting thought.

That’s exactly what we’ve learned over the last decade. It never did either of those things. What it did is that it clouded reputation and trust just about enough to trick people into the illusion of a “trustless” system. There is no such thing. In the end you trust the coders trusted by the people who use the apps implementing the blockchain. There’s no tangible difference to trusting the coders trusted by the banks you use. Yes, with some cryptocurrencies they’re not associated directly with a centralised organisation. But that will absolutely change over time if the cryptocurrency ever becomes relevant to the big corporations of the world. Just as the WWW in practice now is controlled by Google and Apple.The point of selling the idea that a cryptocurrency is “trustless” is to trick you into trusting it just long enough to pull off a Ponzi-scheme or rug-pull. And yes, that goes for Bitcoin too.replysneak 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Controlling the commercial web is not the same as controlling the web.Holding a bunch of bitcoin or mining a bunch of blocks does not allow you or anyone else to redefine bitcoin's fundamental rules.These are incorrect statements.replyJohnFen 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > one of the biggest advantage of crypto stuff is removing the need for reputation and trust.I don't think it does that, though, at least when used as a currency.

Which you can also do with cryptocurrency.Credit cards come with a form insurance built in, but that doesn't mean you're not paying for it (they charge fees), including when you trust your counterparty and don't want to pay extra for insurance on a low-risk transaction.replyJohnFen 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > When people say \"trust\" in the context of Bitcoin, it's about not having to trust a middle manThat's all fine if you're a cryptocurrency guy, but in terms of what ordinary people mean by \"trust\", I don't see how cryptocurrency removes \"the need for reputation and trust.\" You still need those things.> neither does cashTrue.

The usage of biometrics doesn't _completely_ solve this problem, there is still a pool of insiders who have an outsized amount of wld, but a very large number of people will be able to walk up to an orb to claim some wld and they will all receive roughly equal amounts. The initial distribution of wld will be much more fair than the initial distribution of any other token or currency I know of. That is the value of the biometric.replyPurpleRamen 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > The initial distribution of wld will be much more fair than the initial distribution of any other token or currency I know of.

It is possible to create a wallet and send and receive transactions without ever visiting an orb. The only thing the biometric does is send an initial amount of WLD to your wallet and ensure that you can only receive that initial amount once.If someone steals your wallet there is no getting it back, it is not linked to your identity it is just a private key. I'm not really sure what it means in this context to steal your biometrics?> And just out of curiosity, does this system handle collisions of biometrics? Or is it just assuming and hopes for none to happen?This is territory I don't know very well. I believe irises were chosen specifically because they were not invasive and they contain enough entropy that the chance of collisions is quite small. I don't know if it has enough entropy that they can be sure there are no collisions or if it has enough entropy that the expected number of collisions was tolerably low.replyxypage 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It seems you didn't read the article, it specifically talks about people are already buying accounts for $30 or less to be able to make accounts in areas where you're not allowed to register.replylatexr 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > \"Scam\" implies some kind of fraud or lieThen Worldcoin is a scam.https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoi...https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/richardnieva/worldcoin-...replyoh_sigh 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Describing it like this makes it sound very much like a ponzi scheme.

Everybody needs to visit an orb to claim worldcoin but the set of active orbs is managed by worldcoin and when one of them acts suspiciously the orb can be deactivated, among other counter-measures. A set of wallets all owned by distinct people will act differently than a set of wallets controlled by one person.This is obviously not perfect, some fraud will occur.

It’s as if they _want_ the negatives to come to fruition and some sort of radical change to happen as a result of it.Maybe i am reading too much into it and giving sam and the other folks at openai too much credit, but the idea that they might be accelerationists is so crazy that it might actually be fact.Why else would you go above and beyond to build products that you yourself claim can be extremely harmful, they require radical change, other than you wanting for that negative outcome to happen so that you can achieve said change?Didnt the person say or write somewhere that he wants to solve inequality? And since ai would drastically increase inequality by extracting work from the masses and selling it for the profits of the few at massive scale doesnt it is logical to believe that he’a aiming to prove a point.

My original understanding of it was that ai/tech will become so advanced that it will take over a lot of the production and labor we currently do to feed, build, and supply the world with resources and when that part is automated, humans would hopefully be freed up to do more with their life. This would have to involve restructuring money, society and how governments and resources are allocated. Ties to UBI and how much people get will have to be solved in a different way since we no longer need to do all the menial work. The time span between ai starting to be able to do all of this (maybe starting soon) and when we finally figure out we don't need to work for money is the terrible part where loss of jobs would eventually cause an upheaval and rethinking of how society needs to be structured and the acceleration that people talk about is trying to speed through this bad part as fast as possible to get to the other side as possible. I guess my idea of it is not at all what others seem to think though? I'm pretty pessimistic the \"other side\" will actually be a utopia but that would be up to the collective to figure out but it seems like a worthwhile concept on the surface.replyJohnFen 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Of course, one of the problems with the idea is that it endorses throwing innocent others under the economic bus.

That capitalism is just getting started and that it's unstoppable and that it won't transition into socialisim like Marx predicted but rather will encompass more and more of everything and be the vehicle for the next evolution into a cybernetic species. It's the evolution of evolution and it's unstoppable. So get on with it and learn to love it.Quotes like \"it is easier to imagine an end to the world than an end to capitalism\" and Mark Fisher's (CCNU and Nick Land, etc)ideas around capitalism realism sort of sum it up.replyNursie 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I mean, it’s pretty easy to imagine capitalism precipitating the end of the world …replynemo44x 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't see that per-se. I think it's more likely that capitalism continues to rapidly advance technology to the point where we truly do evolve evolution. So a certain part of the global population will have access to DNA synthesizers and other biotech and AI and can reproduce a master race of post-humans that will dominate and eventually annihilate Homosapiens. After a few generations of rapid improvement (a singularity where post-humans and AI merge into a single entity) they'll view the rest of the world as we view other primates today and won't have much use for them. If not through intentional genocide then just being unable to compete for ecosystem, etc. Homosapiens will fade away as Neanderthals did.Capitalism is a system (much more than just an economic system) that allows for selection like this. In a sense a type of market driven Darwinism which chooses how energy is spent developing the tools that allow humans to evolve rapidly into the next thing. That it's natural that Capitalism started with the industrial revolution which marks the beginning of humans evolving tech rapidly. It's almost as if it was inevitable once we reached that stage. To be against it is futile as it's as natural as gravity. And we just keep getting better at it.replyJohnFen 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Capitalism is a system (much more than just an economic system) that allows for selection like this.You just described capitalism as a kind of suicide pact.I don't entirely disagree, but limit this critique to unrestricted capitalism.

It doesn't really matter since there's no alternative. Accelerationism isn't even a conscience choice per-se - it's a phenomenon that is a product of technological advancement of which Capitalism is the vehicle for. If anything, the only conscious choice is to not resist it as that's ultimately futile since it can't be stopped. Well, unless we went full Teddy K, which I don't think is likely.replyJohnFen 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is not a rational response, I admit, but I simply cannot accept that our doom is inevitable and resistance is futile.

Big picture, I don't think the problem of distinguishing humans from bots online is a big enough deal that we should take hits in other areas to solve it.The least-harm solution, as far as I can see right now, is to just accept that the internet cannot be made trustworthy in this way.

If you read comments on a news story about an upcoming election in your country, you should see some that are verifiably a human citizen from your country, separate from everything else. Pay attention to everything else at your discretion.I think a web that is half identified and half anonymous would work well.replypavlov 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There isn't a single solution to be had because there isn't a single way you interact with strangers online.Verifying identity is necessarily completely different if you're sending someone an item in exchange for money, or looking to date them for a while, or going into long-term business with them, or maybe just having a discussion where you want to validate that they work where they claim.We don't need blanket verification of people's identities online. If a bot is posting on a service and is indistinguishable from an interesting human, why shouldn't it stay? \"On the internet, nobody knows you're a dog\" used to be the Web 1.0 motto.replyfvdessen 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] In Europe there's eIDAS. You install an app on your phone that can be used to identify yourself. This is used to sign documents, payments, single sign on to other apps / websites, etc. During onboarding you will need to verify your identity with the help of the government, banks, or other recognised authorities. Afterwards it's just the app. It works very well.replybjelkeman-again 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The thing is that in some cultures people are strongly against ID cards. In the UK for example, for a long time there was a fight against a national identity card. Even though you have to get one (a passport) to travel abroad. Instead they would use electricity bills to prove things like you actually live somewhere. Or the driver license was a pice of paper, with no photo. With fraud as a result.I think it is based on that in some countries there is less trust in the government than in other countries.Where I live, Sweden, it is very hard to live without an ID card/passport and starting to get hard without a digital ID.However, the privacy laws and prevention against abuse is fairly good. Not perfect I am sure but pretty good, compared with the US or even the UK (both places I have lived).replyineptech 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > The only idea I see is for some certificates handed out by government to citizens and I absolutely hate it even in a democracy.I think this is the answer.

We can provide \"trust\", which is when we narrow the definition to verifying whether mathematical objects have been tampered with, or whether they can be observed without secret keys, but we could always make safes.Trusting a safe isn't like trusting a person.replyyreg 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't find this helpful.Captchas have solved a real problem.

So reddit doesn't get your identity, they are just able to prevent you from making another account (or perhaps limit it to a few accounts per real person). If they are nice, they don't even need to track which accounts belong to the same person.Of course there is a lot of space for abuse. And it would unfairly lock many/most people out, because services can only accept certificates from the governments they trusts.reply 54 more comments...",

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Electronic Frontier Foundation About Issues Our Work Take Action Tools Donate SEARCH The U.K. Government Is Very Close To Eroding Encryption Worldwide  BY JOE MULLIN JULY 26, 2023The U.K. Parliament is pushing ahead with a sprawling internet regulation bill that will, among other things, undermine the privacy of people around the world. The Online Safety Bill, now at the final stage before passage in the House of Lords, gives the British government the ability to force backdoors into messaging services, which will destroy end-to-end encryption. No amendments have been accepted that would mitigate the bill’s most dangerous elements. TAKE ACTIONTELL THE U.K. PARLIAMENT: DON'T BREAK ENCRYPTIONIf it passes, the Online Safety Bill will be a huge step backwards for global privacy, and democracy itself. Requiring government-approved software in peoples’ messaging services is an awful precedent. If the Online Safety Bill becomes British law, the damage it causes won’t stop at the borders of the U.K. The sprawling bill, which originated in a white paper on “online harms” that’s now more than four years old, would be the most wide-ranging internet regulation ever passed. At EFF, we’ve been clearly speaking about its disastrous effects for more than a year now. It would require content filtering, as well as age checks to access erotic content. The bill also requires detailed reports about online activity to be sent to the government. Here, we’re discussing just one fatally flawed aspect of OSB—how it will break encryption. An Obvious Threat To Human RightsIt’s a basic human right to have a private conversation. To have those rights realized in the digital world, the best technology we have is end-to-end encryption. And it’s utterly incompatible with the government-approved message-scanning technology required in the Online Safety Bill. This is because of something that EFF has been saying for years—there is no backdoor to encryption that only gets used by the “good guys.” Undermining encryption, whether by banning it, pressuring companies away from it, or requiring client side scanning, will be a boon to bad actors and authoritarian states.The U.K. government wants to grant itself the right to scan every message online for content related to child abuse or terrorism—and says it will still, somehow, magically, protect peoples’ privacy. That’s simply impossible. U.K. civil society groups have condemned the bill, as have technical experts and human rights groups around the world. The companies that provide encrypted messaging—such as WhatsApp, Signal, and the UK-based Element—have also explained the bill’s danger. In an open letter published in April, they explained that OSB “could break end-to-end encryption, opening the door to routine, general and indiscriminate surveillance of personal messages of friends, family members, employees, executives, journalists, human rights activists and even politicians themselves.” Apple joined this group in June, stating publicly that the bill threatens encryption and “could put U.K. citizens at greater risk.” U.K. Government Says: Nerd HarderIn response to this outpouring of resistance, the U.K. government’s response has been to wave its hands and deny reality. In a response letter to the House of Lords seen by EFF, the U.K.’s Minister for Culture, Media and Sport simply re-hashes an imaginary world in which messages can be scanned while user privacy is maintained. “We have seen companies develop such solutions for platforms with end-to-end encryption before,” the letter states, a reference to client-side scanning. “Ofcom should be able to require” the use of such technologies, and where “off-the-shelf solutions” are not available, “it is right that the Government has led the way in exploring these technologies.” The letter refers to the Safety Tech Challenge Fund, a program in which the U.K. gave small grants to companies to develop software that would allegedly protect user privacy while scanning files. But of course, they couldn’t square the circle. The grant winners’ descriptions of their own prototypes clearly describe different forms of client-side scanning, in which user files are scoped out with AI before they’re allowed to be sent in an encrypted channel. The Minister completes his response on encryption by writing: We expect the industry to use its extensive expertise and resources to innovate and build robust solutions for individual platforms/services that ensure both privacy and child safety by preventing child abuse content from being freely shared on public and private channels.This is just repeating a fallacy that we’ve heard for years: that if tech companies can’t create a backdoor that magically defends users, they must simply “nerd harder.” British Lawmakers Still Can And Should Protect Our PrivacyU.K. lawmakers still have a chance to stop their nation from taking this shameful leap forward towards mass surveillance. End-to-end encryption was not fully considered and voted on during either committee or report stage in the House of Lords. The Lords can still add a simple amendment that would protect private messaging, and specify that end-to-end encryption won’t be weakened or removed.Earlier this month, EFF joined U.K. civil society groups and sent a briefing explaining our position to the House of Lords. The briefing explains the encryption-related problems with the current bill, and proposes the adoption of an amendment that will protect end-to-end encryption. If such an amendment is not adopted, those who pay the price will be “human rights defenders and journalists who rely on private messaging to do their jobs in hostile environments; and … those who depend on privacy to be able to express themselves freely, like LGBTQ+ people.” It’s a remarkable failure that the House of Lords has not even taken up a serious debate over protecting encryption and privacy, despite ample time to review every every section of the bill. TAKE ACTIONTELL THE U.K. PARLIAMENT: PROTECT ENCRYPTION—AND OUR PRIVACYFinally, Parliament should reject this bill because universal scanning and surveillance is abhorrent to their own constituents. It is not what the British people want. A recent survey of U.K. citizens showed that 83% wanted the highest level of security and privacy available on messaging apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Element. Documents related to the U.K. Online Safety Bill: EFF info page on the U.K. Online Safety Bill EFF Deeplinks Blog: How the OSB attacks Free Speech and Encryption (August 2022)  EFF Deeplinks Blog: UK's Draft Online Safety Bill Raises Serious Concerns Around Freedom of Expression (July 2021) Civil society open letter on Online Safety Bill (November 2022) Open Letter from encrypted messaging providers about Online Safety Bill (April 2023)  EFF and Allied NGOs Briefing to House of Lords (July 2023)   RELATED UPDATES DEEPLINKS BLOG BY ANDREW CROCKER | JULY 27, 2023 Maryland Supreme Court: Police Can’t Search Digital Data When Users Revoke ConsentThis post was co-authored by EFF legal intern Virginia KennedyUnder the Fourth Amendment, police can search your home, your computer, and other private spaces without a warrant or even probable cause if you freely and voluntarily consent to the search.

People will want to use WhatsApp, the government themselves use it extensively. If meta refuses there is very little they can do. Facebook can continue to operate without a single person on the ground in UK. It might harm their business in some ways but it's definitely doable. The government might be able to force/convince Apple and Google to take it out their app stores in the UK but such regional restrictions are easily bypassed and WhatsApp is popular enough to make people try it. So that would then normalise the practices such as side loading / jail breaking and avoiding regional restrictions. Cyber criminals would be rubbing their hands at the opportunities this creates and I am sure the peodos and terrorists this is meant to be stopping will jump at the chance to get in on the act.replyajdude 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] > The government might be able to force/convince Apple and Google to take it out their app stores in the UKApple has even threatened to withdraw their own systems from the UK rather than comply with this.https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/20/apple-imessage-facetime-remov...replysneak 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Unlike in China, where they do presently escrow keys to the government for mass surveillance.replymatthewdgreen 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m pretty concerned about what Apple is doing in China, but there’s no evidence at all that Apple is escrowing end-to-end encryption keys to the government. There’s also no evidence that the Chinese government is using Apple’s non-E2E keys (held in Apple hardware in a cage at a Chinese hosting provider) for mass surveillance. I’m not saying that it’s impossible: I’m saying if you could come up with that evidence, either through reverse-engineering or a verifiable leak from Apple, it would be the biggest story in tech. You would be famous and (if you knew the right hedge fund) probably very rich.replycapableweb 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That Apple operates iCloud in every single country except China, where GCBD (AIPO Cloud (Guizhou) Technology Co. Ltd) operates iCloud, think I makes pretty clear what's going on.replygraeme 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That’s separate from iMessage, which is end to end.Apple used to be able to access iMessages through iCloud backups. They changed their system worldwide, now they can’t. So presumably GCBD also lost access to iMessages in iCloud backups.replysneak 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Apple can still read ~100% of all iMessages in real-time because iCloud Backup (non e2ee by default) serves as a key escrow backdoor in the e2ee of iMessage. It is thus legitimate to state that iMessage is not e2ee as in practice each iMessage is also encrypted to a key held by Apple (in addition to the endpoints).Even if you turn it (e2ee iCloud Backup) on, it's ineffective, as both parties to a conversation must have turned it on for the conversation to be private.Your beliefs are inaccurate.replyTwisell 50 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes and to be precise this is the relevant source : https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303The optional iCloud feature called \"Advanced Data Protection\" is currently an opt-in. It comes with a significant drawback for typical pop and mom users --> If you lost you password and recovery key it's game over you loose everything. So I guess it's sensible to keep this as an opt-in until users are better educated about this drawback.What will be quite significant is wether or not this feature will be available for chinese users.It make sense from a technical POV to block ADP feature in poorly democratic countries that might request it like China and maybe tomorrow the UK.PS : Once a significant % of users activated ADP it could be a good UX improvement to display a warning to mixed ADP status conversation that the conversation is not fully e2e encrypted. However this might be premature right now otherwise early adopters of ADP would be flooded by such warning.replythrowaway290 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > iCloud Backup (non e2ee by default)I don't see any option to enable e2ee iCloud Backup on iOS 16.6, does this mean your information is outdated and it's all e2ee now?replyvages 58 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] It’s called “advanced data protection”. You’ll find it hidden deep within the iCloud settings.It’s off by default.replysuumcuique 45 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Wow, thanks for mentioning this. I was also under the impression it was e2ee by default but it was actually disabled for me.replymotohagiography 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Regarding the financial impact, what's the trade if they find out China is different? Shorting Apple? I don't think that would be a consequence. Nobody cares that China intercepts everything, we just don't want to live there or in a regime like it.There was a rumor about separate HSMs for device personalization in China, and this would be verifiable by determining whether the Chinese HSMs could verify cryptograms produced by derived keys from a US device, against Apple's personalizaiton endpoints in china. I don't know the protocol off hand, but there is a short list of ways to do it. If Apple uses different root secrets in China from the rest of the world, what further evidence would you need?replymatthewdgreen 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Apple has claimed that they don’t allow China to intercept communications using these keys. They’ve said on the record to the WSJ that they don’t do any combination of these things, and they left very little wiggle room in their denials (Google Apple China encryption keys WSJ). If you could show that they were compromising security for the Chinese government but not making any allowances for the FBI, and that their executives were lying about it, it would be a massive political scandal. There would almost certainly be congressional hearings, simply because any one of {Apple, China, tech executives caught lying, tech executives secretly collaborating with foreign governments} is by itself an opportunity for Congresspeople to get their face on TV and this would cover all the bases. Following this there would be huge US government pressure for Apple to (at minimum) cease collaborating with China to surveil its people, or else to offer the same capability to the US government. Potentially Apple’s entire business in China could be jeopardized if it was predicated on secret collaboration, not to mention their whole supply chain would be even more at risk. In the long run Apple might maneuver out of the situation somehow, but in the short run it would certainly affect them very badly.replykahnclusions 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Chinese national security law includes a gag order for such assistance requests.Apple can say they don’t allow it, because their local partner company is the one actually doing it. And the local partner would say they don’t allow it, because Chinese law (and the Party) requires them to keep all national security assistance secret.replyfsckboy 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >Apple has claimed that they don’t allow China to intercept communications using these keys.

But it hasn’t given up hope on the West.replycoldtea 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Or Apple doesn't care about either, just pays lip service to both.replysupernikio2 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes, because China has double the population as the whole of Europe. Ceasing operations in the UK wouldn't hurt their revenue as much as doing so in China.replychongli 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, the population of China is not the issue. The problem for Apple is that so many of their products are still made in China that if they anger the Chinese government they risk having their factories closed, leaving them with no products to sell. To say this would be disastrous for sales would be an understatement.replyllm_nerd 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The last thing China is going to do is close manufacturing plants.Apple makes 10x more selling in the Chinese market than they do in the United Kingdom, even with all of the roadblocks and handicaps China erects. Further Apple realizes that as the UK is a Western, democratic nation it is easy to essentially bargain about policies. Apple's current threats are essentially negotiating. There would be no negotiating with China about stuff like this.replypeyton 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Beijing can’t even shut down the factories north of the city that dump particulates into the lungs of the leadership and their families.

Capitulation there isn’t a step onto the slippery slope. Doing the same thing in the UK would lead very quickly to EU and US demands to do the same.By exiting such a small market, Apple defends the much larger markets against creeping surveillance.Remember how fierce the backlash was to their CSAM scanning proposal? They walked that back. Some people might think it was for moral reasons, but I’m pretty sure they realized it would harm their bottom line.The way things work in China is not the same as the UK. They either play by CCP rules or they don’t play at all. Apple’s calculus here seems to be that not playing in the UK market is worth it, whereas missing out on the Chinese market is not worth it.replyAlupis 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Nobody needs to operate in China. That's the thing that's being overlooked.Apple made a choice to operate there - and would have still been the world's most valued company regardless.So, Apple's choice was to sell-out their privacy and security credentials to make more money - counting on their other large markets (ie. the US) not paying close enough attention to see the blatant hypocrisy.\"Security and privacy are great - unless we can make more money selling off your security and privacy to oppressive government regimes!\"Somehow that just doesn't have a catchy marketing ring to it...So now there's precedent that Apple will violate everything they stand for if a large enough market demands it.

I don't think any electronics manufacturer (or meta-manufacturer/designer/whatever/globalization is weird) within an order of magnitude of Apple's scale can practically operate without benefit of China's manufacturing base.It feels like you have to bend the intuitive notion of \"deciding\" to operate in China even means for this to make sense and you just want to pin something on Apple here because they're a giant corporation, and all giant corporations are morally gray at best. The global economy has \"decided\" that China has the manufacturing base for this kind of business.This doesn't seem productive in the way that appeals to personal responsibility fall flat in dealing with societal issues, like, we shouldn't have public drug treatment programs because people shouldn't do drugs. People do drugs, and there are costs to not having public treatment programs, so if you want to pretend it's just a matter of personal responsibility, you are indeed pretending, because it is also a societal problem not negated by framing it as personal responsibility.Here, we assign \"personal responsibility\" to Apple for operating in China, when we have the \"societal issue\" of large scale electronics manufacturing centralizing there so that they have the industrial base for it. The world, on the whole, has allowed China to link into the world economy in this manner regardless of their humans rights record and other issues.So, while there's nothing to love about Apple here, I feel like it's really missing the forest for the trees to frame this as an \"Apple\" issue in any sense whatsoever, but should be framed as a China-human-rights, globalization, and world economy issue, and we don't do ourselves any favors with appeals to \"corporate personal responsibility\"replydividedbyzero 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's also important to draw red lines right away before unwelcome precedents are set.

Much of my thinking about the importance of free play comes from Peter Gray, a professor of psychology at Boston College who is one of the world’s leading experts on the psychology of play. See his powerful TED talk, where he lays out the evolutionary origins of play—a necessity for all young mammals. He then shows how we have systematically deprived children of free play since the 1970s and shows that adolescents' mental health has declined substantially over the same period. He notes that this is a correlation, not proof of causation, although experiments with animals support the claim that play deprivation causes anxiety and poor social development.Peter gave that talk in 2014. Since then, the mental health of children and adolescents has worsened, and evidence has increased showing that Peter was correct. Peter recently published a major review article in the Journal of Pediatrics titled Decline in Independent Activity as a Cause of Decline in Children’s Mental Well-being: Summary of the Evidence. I think it’s among the most important essays ever written on play. I was planning to write a summary of the article for the After Babel Substack, but a few days ago, I got Peter’s own summary of the article, which he posted on his new Substack, Play Makes Us Human, which you can find and subscribe to here:Play Makes Us Human Letters about the roles of play in human evolution, child development, culture, and daily living By Peter GrayI asked Peter if I could repost his Substack essay at After Babel. He said yes, and you’ll find it below. Peter and I disagree on whether smartphones and social media are also major causes of the teen mental health crisis, as you’ll see. But we both agree that play deprivation is a major contributing cause and that anyone who is serious about the mental health of children and teens (and adults) should be up in arms about what America and many other countries have done to prevent children from playing in the ways they need and want to play.I note that Peter is a co-founder, with me, Lenore Skenazy, and Daniel Shuchman, of LetGrow.org, where we both serve on the board. LetGrow offers many resources for parents, schools, and state legislators that want to act on Peter’s advice and introduce more free play and autonomy into children’s lives.— Jon HaidtIn this letter, I summarize the contents of an article that anthropologist David Lancy, developmental psychologist David Bjorklund, and I published recently in the Journal of Pediatrics. For the full account, including citations to research supporting each point, see the article here. Throughout this letter, I use the term “children” to refer to everyone under 18 years old unless otherwise specified.We began the article with two very well-established and disturbing facts.Two Very Well-Established and Disturbing Facts Children’s freedom to play and explore has declined greatly over the last half-century.The first fact is that over the past 5 decades or more we have seen, in the United States, a continuous and overall huge decline in children’s freedom to play or engage in any activities independent of direct adult monitoring and control. With every decade children have become less free to play, roam, and explore alone or with other children away from adults, less free to occupy public spaces without an adult guard, and less free to have a part-time job where they can demonstrate their capacity for responsible self-control. Among the causes of this change are a large increase in societal fears that children are in danger if not constantly guarded, a large increase in the time that children must spend in school and at schoolwork at home, and a large increase in the societal view that children’s time is best spent in adult-directed school-like activities, such as formal sports and lessons, even when not in school.Children’s mental health has declined greatly over the last half-century.The second undisputed fact is that over these same decades, rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide among young people have increased enormously. Using data from standard clinical questionnaires administered to school-aged children over the decades, researchers have estimated that the rates of what we now call major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder increased by roughly 5- to 8-fold during the second half of the 20th century, and other measures indicate that they have continued to increase during the first two decades of the 21st century.Perhaps the most compelling and disturbing evidence comes from research on suicides and suicidal thoughts. Data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that the rate of suicide among children younger than age 15 rose 3.5-fold between 1950 and 2005 and by another 2.4-fold between 2005 and 2020. By 2019, suicide was the second leading cause of death for children from age 10 through 15, behind only unintentional injury (including traffic fatalities). Moreover, the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System survey revealed that during the previous year 18.8% of US high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, 15.7% made a suicide plan, 8.9% attempted suicide one or more times, and 2.5% made a suicide attempt requiring medical treatment.Such findings led the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and Children’s Hospital Association to issue, in 2021, a joint statement to the Biden administration urging that child and adolescent mental health be declared a “national emergency.”ShareReasons to Believe that the Decline in Freedom is a Major Cause of the Decline in Mental HealthYou would think it would be obvious that taking away free play and other freedoms to act independently would make children anxious, depressed, and in some cases suicidal, but we adults are remarkably skilled at burying our heads in the sand on this issue. If you read the popular press, you would think the problem is screens and social media, or almost anything else other than the fact that we have more or less locked children up around the clock. So, here is some of the evidence we spelled out in the Journal of Pediatrics article.Immediate effects of play and other independent activity on mental well-being.Research, proving what should be obvious, shows that play is a direct source of children’s happiness. When children are asked to depict or describe activities that make them happy, they depict or describe scenes of play. There is also research showing that when children are allowed a little more play—such as when schools offer a little more recess—the kids become happier. Research also reveals that children consider play to be activity that they themselves initiate and control. If an adult is directing it, it’s not play. The joy of play is the joy of freedom from adult control. Other research reveals that the rates of emotional breakdowns and suicides among school-aged children decline markedly every summer when schools shut down and rise again when schools open. During the summer children have at least some more opportunity for independent activity than they do during the school year. There is also evidence that teens who have part-time jobs are happier than those who don’t, because of the sense of independence and confidence they gain from the job.Long-term effects of play and other independent activity on mental well-being.Beyond promoting immediate mental well-being, play and other independent activities build mental capacities and attitudes that foster future well-being. Research shows that people of all ages who have a strong internal locus of control (internal LOC), that is, a strong sense of being able to solve their own problems and take charge of their own lives, are much less likely to suffer from anxiety and depression than those with a weaker internal LOC. Obviously, however, to develop a strong internal LOC a person needs considerable experience of actually being in control, which is not possible if you are continuously being monitored and controlled by others.Other research has assessed relationships between the amount of time children have to direct their own activities and psychological characteristics predictive of future mental health. Such research has revealed significant positive correlations between the amount of self-structured time (largely involving free play) young children have and (1) scores on tests of executive functioning (ability to create and follow through on a plan to solve a set of problems); (2) indices of emotional control and social ability; and (3) scores, 2 years later, on a measure of self-regulation.Moreover, two retrospective studies with adults have shown that those who recall more instances of independent play when they were children are, by various indices, happier and more successful in adulthood than those who recall less such independence. And research with college students reveals that those with over-controlling parents (as assessed with questionnaires) fare more poorly psychologically than those whose parents are less controlling. These and other correlational studies all point in the same direction. Opportunities to take more control of your own life when young predict better future well-being.Play is the primary vehicle through which children satisfy psychological needs essential to mental health.Dozens of research studies, conducted with people of a wide range of ages, have led to the conclusion that mental health for all of us depends on our ability to satisfy three basic psychological needs—the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The logic underlying this is straightforward. To feel in charge of our life, to feel we can meet the bumps in the roads of life with equanimity, we must feel free to choose our own paths (autonomy); feel sufficiently skilled to pursue those paths (competence); and have friends and colleagues for support, including emotional support (relatedness).How do children satisfy these psychological needs? They do so through play and other self-chosen, self-controlled activities. Play and other self-directed activities are, by definition, autonomous; such activities build skills (competence) in endeavors that children care about and that prepare them for adulthood (see Letter #5); and such activities are the primary means by which children make friends (relatedness).By depriving children of play and other independent activities we are depriving them of the experiences they need to grow up with the confidence and ability to run their own lives.Leave a commentFinal ThoughtsSo, what can you, I, and others do about this? Too many people are focusing on drugs and therapy, as if something is wrong with the kids that needs correction, and not enough of us are thinking about prevention. Prevention would involve bringing normal childhood back to children. Children are designed to play and explore and thereby becoming increasingly independent as they grow older. Their instincts tell them that something is seriously wrong if they don’t have such independence. Letter #14 outlines some ways to bring more play into children’s lives in today’s overprotective world, but we also need to work for change in the larger societal constraints on children’s lives.If you wish to see more of the research evidence behind what I have described here, including reference citations, you can do so by examining our article in the Journal of Pediatrics.PostscriptTo subscribe to Peter’s substack, enter your email address here:Play Makes Us Human Letters about the roles of play in human evolution, child development, culture, and daily living By Peter GrayIf you’re not already a subscriber to the After Babel substack, please enter your email address here:SubscribeShare243 Likes · 42 Restacks 243 104 Share A guest post by Peter Gray Boston College research professor Peter Gray specializes in the nature and value of play.

Not to compare them to children but the dogs that I care for who are the healthiest and happiest are the ones who are given opportunities to socialize and play freely and engage with nature on a regular basis. They are confident, curious, independent and have good, strong relationships. They also make better choices, especially in stressful situations. If it works for them, it must also work for children?We are pack animals and require connection and collaboration to grow and thrive.Obviously proper rest and nutrition are key contributors as well but let’s start with kicking the kids back outside to explore and play.

'Play' is a misleading term. They're testing the world. They're learning how things work. How gravity works. How friction holds lego together. How actions cause reactions. How friends and strangers behave when you do things. How to use language with make believe. How to comfortably and safely explore new ideas out loud with their action figures. How to discover what feels good and what doesn't. They're not playing. They're growing.\"My kids are young. But I'm confident this is generally true for teenagers, too. One quick example: I played WoW and looking back... I learned a ton about how to work in a team. How to be social. What social behaviours work and don't work. How to deal with people you don't like. How to delay gratification. How to plan. And it was all in a low-stakes environment.replylolinder 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] I wholeheartedly agree based on my own kids, but want to add a caution lest someone misunderstand: this testing, learning, and growing is of a kind that can only be done without adult supervision. It's not something that you can give them with a private lesson. It's not something that can be taught in a classroom. It's not something that can happen at all without adults letting the kids figure it out on their own by random trial and error.Parents generally have a strong instinct to try to make things easier for their kids than they were for themselves growing up. We know the food is hot, so we blow on the kid's food or let it cool before giving it to them. We know the toy will break if it's repeatedly thrown down the stairs, so we impose a rule that \"we don't do that in our house\". We know X, Y, or Z, so we sit down with them and explain it to them.I don't think that these explanations and rules have no place (I don't want a child learning what heat is by falling onto a wood-burning stove!), but we need to recognize that it's a strictly inferior way of learning something when compared to experience. And as you point out, unstructured play is where kids get that experience in a low-stakes environment.Play serves a valuable purpose, but as soon as parents get involved to try to assist the purpose evaporates.replyWaterluvian 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The way I explain this is, \"my job is not to protect my kids from harm, it's to protect them from irreparable harm.\"I've had this instinct whenever my kids are on the jungle gym to say, \"slow down!\" \"That's too high!\" etc. but I usually catch myself and think, \"if they fall is it a cry or a hospital visit?\"replymrguyorama 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If you don't allow your kids to fuck up, they will never build healthy behaviors around fucking up.

She just told her story, and talked about all the horrible shit she saw, but never once told us drug war lies.The other was from my English teacher a few weeks before graduation. The gist of it was: \"there's nothing I can say that will stop you from experimenting with drugs. A little bit of drugs probably won't ruin your lives, and might be fun, but pay attention to the people who don't moderate, and the people who do. The results speak for themselves.\"What it came down to was it was the two people that were honest with us who got heard. Some DARE cop lecturing us from a DEA handout about how marijuana addiction would ruin our lives didn't work, because kids aren't stupid, and they know BS when they hear it.replyet-al 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Fentanyl has changed things, though.Coke wasn't a big deal as an occasional party drug, but now we hear stories of tainted coke and overdosing.

What somewhat mattered is trying to explaing, honestly, the consequences. Sadly, this doesn't work good enough, but sometimes it helps when instead of panicking they panic but remember what to do in the case of emergency.reply_a_a_a_ 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That sounds like the right way to do it. I would have welcomed that down to earth honesty at my school. We only got half the info we needed, the half they wanted us to hear, and at that point I lost trust in them.replydror 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] - Lead by example. Be responsible about your own use and be honest about it.- Help them engage in constructive risk taking behavior. Sports are a common example, and there's plenty of research showing that they reduce harmful behavior. Teens, specifically males explore risky behavior. They have these new magnificent bodies and they want to test their limits.- Be present, available and engaged with them. Some of the time, they'll want you out of their face. That's fine, but try and keep routines like family meals, and talk to them, if they're willing.- Try to maintain the family. Sometimes a divorce/separation is the right thing, but for the kids, most of the time, keeping the family together in a dual-parent family is very important.replyTwo4 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] While your comment addresses the most common factors contributing to addiction, it doesn't really answer the question of how to let children experience the consequences of addiction in a way that's low stakes and not irreversible.replywhythre 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I am not sure it’s possible. Part of what defines addiction is that overpowers the will, which isn’t safe. It also is typically a long term decent, a series of poor decisions in the grip of a disease. Not easy to model.replychasd00 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] my kids aren't old enough to comprehend these things yet but family friends take their kids to volunteer at homeless shelters, food pantries, etc. Seeing addiction and what it does to lives first hand is a good motivator to not let it happen to you.replyjxramos 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I've been day dreaming about as more social data goes public on the internet how can that enable us to peer into the lives of folks who post material and leak details of their lives online. Can sociological studies be made where these bad choices can be reviewed in accelerated form where the individuals who picked the wrong path show the fruits of their choices visually and the decline is evident just looking at them and hearing the things they talk about.Not sure how feasible it is, but I think with all the photo and video data we now have on hand what sort of longitudinal studies we can produce from imagery alone with the occasional detail and context self professed by the individuals involved.reply_a_a_a_ 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] People can disregard fucking anything they don't want to hear.

It was super effective.replyem-bee 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] what works is living by example. and letting the kids grow up in an environment where nobody does drugs. showing them the bad outcome that others suffering from addiction experience may also be instructive. but generally kids do as the parents do. if you have a good relationship with your kids so that they are not trying to take drugs out of protest, then they won't be tempted to try.reply_a_a_a_ 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think you'll end up with drug-naive kids, which may be a similar risk. You've just shifted the risk to an older period of their life. Kids need information, not naivete enforced through ignorance.replyem-bee 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] living by example doesn't mean don't talk to your kids about drugs.there are only two options: kids learn about drugs by others telling them about it, or they learn by trying them. the latter is dangerous, so the former is the only option. everything else is the environment.my parents never talked to me about drugs or alcohol. we did talk about it in school though. i simply grew up in a family where alcohol or drugs did not exist, in an environment where kids didn't have easy access to alcohol and where we were generally educated in school to avoid that stuff. so noone did drugs or got drunk at school. maybe a few kids were drinking outside of school but it was never a big thing. i remember a classmate from middleschool saying that he refused to get cigarettes or beer for his dad because it's unhealthy. that's the kind of environment i grew up in. tell me how does that make me drug-naive and put me at risk? later as a student many of my peers frequently drank alcohol with meals, etc, i never did, and was never interested, because that's how i grew up.of course if that is not your environment then you have to be more proactive about making sure your kids are aware of the dangers, but in general, what has the most value is the example you give as parents. if you drink, you will have a much harder time to convince your kids to not drink.and for drugs it is my understanding that those who have experience with alcohol are more likely to try harder drugs too. (even just a small percentage) but more important the reverse, those that do not drink alcohol also are unlikely to try harder drugs. my interpretation of that is that if i want my kids to avoid drugs i can do that by not drinking alcohol and showing them that they need not join their peers when they drink.this is not to say that anyone drinking is putting their kids at risk, but that not drinking is very helpful to reduce that risk.replypineaux 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think this is bad advice.replypineaux 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This was already a solved problem. Just get the kids use all the stuff away from parents when they are between 14 and 18. Yes it will do a little bit of brain damage, but getting pissdrunk at that age and having your parents nurse you back to normal is a great experience for a kid. I know this from first hand experience, when I was 14 (it was sorta normal in the Netherlands at that time). I was a lot more carefully with any substances afterwards. As for addiction: kids are getting addicted to their phones and games all the time.replyvacuity 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't know about the Netherlands, but I'm definitely not doing that in the US if I have kids.

They're all ditzing around on busy sidewalks and the father barks \"Control yourselves!\"It occurred to me at that moment that this kind of hovering and scolding teaches children to externalize the responsibility of understanding their environment and their place within it. They will literally never learn the lessons this father wants to impart because he will always be there to act for them, until the children's brains lose the plasticity necessary to properly internalize those things. Perhaps they will always struggle with a psychological complex they can never fully understand.I know this because I had a doting mother who always defined my priorities for me. I learned to nearly fully externalize the maintenance of those priorities to her expectations (which were transitively pinned to those of the formal academic and \"professional\" systems).Because of this I'm currently going through something of an existential crisis -- I really don't know what I want to do. My career has been unfulfilling and trying to develop lasting hobbies and interests have not borne out the deep kinds of satisfaction others seem to be able to achieve. I still hold out hope I can find something that \"gets the ball rolling\" but learning patience while watching myself continue to orient myself toward goals that have definitive, quantifiable, socially-acceptable ends has been unsettling. I want to feel comfortable in my day-to-day, or at least confident that the processes I enact encourage the development of a more whole being.replySoftTalker 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Eh don't beat yourself up. I grew up with a lot of unstructured play time and I still don't feel like I have any real passions or a very satisfying career.

Such is the nature of parables.replyscruple 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'll offer a perspective. I'm a father of 3 young kids (4 year old twins, 20 month old). I often find myself in situations where I also need my children to stop whatever they're currently doing and pay attention to me.You mention this happened on a sidewalk. Cars drive next to sidewalks. The American culture of cars is the number one cause of anxiety in my life as a parent to young children. I do not want to feel this anxiety, I do not like how it makes me react towards my children, who just want to play and have fun and explore the world and try to understand it. But cars exist. And today they are a much bigger problem than they were when I was their age, for a whole variety of reasons that are very well understood and articulated by people far more intelligent and capable than I am. And my children are, practically every single day, within 4-6 feet of cars that are a) much larger than they have any right to be, and b) driving much faster than they have any reason to, to the point that if they are careless about where they are, or what they are doing, they run a very serious risk of being killed.That is why I sometimes respond to my children the way that I do, in line with what you've observed here. I don't like it, either, but it is what it is.Now, I go out of my way to get my kids into big, wide, safe open spaces on a daily basis, and I will deliberately ignore them (within reason -- I keep tabs on where they are, etc.) so that they can go off and find interesting ways to play, hurt themselves, whatever. But I still have to engage with the automobile problem multiple times almost every single day of our lives.replyrcpt 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > CarsThis is 99% of it (other 1% is fear of other parents scolding you). There's a beach bike path near us with only one street crossing in 5 miles. My 6 and 7 year old are free to explore the whole thing unattended provided they avoid that crossing. It has playgrounds and all kinds of stuff they can stop their bikes at.But I won't let them cross the street we live on because none of these drivers are thinking about pedestrians and even if they were I doubt any of the lifted trucks could even see a 4ft tall kid.replyuoaei 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I didn't mean to make it seem like I was challenging the parent's decision to involve themselves in the behaviors of their kids.

And actually, kids that are told to watch it actually overall do take more care about that sort of stuff then if parents just let them do whatever.replySomewhatLikely 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My young kids would be totally unaware if they were bumping into others, or causing them to stop abruptly, or otherwise interfering with others. Of course if those strangers yelled at them or provided some less harsh form of feedback it might register with them, but I find most people don't say anything so it's on me to let my kids know the effects they're behavior is having.replyryandrake 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > I find most people don't say anything so it's on me to let my kids know the effects they're behavior is having.People are terrified of saying anything because of the likely reaction of the kids' parents. The \"it takes a village\" mindset is gone. If someone's kid runs into you and you so much as say \"excuse me\" to them, you risk the parents getting in your face, holding up their cellphone camera, yelling \"You don't talk to my kids. Go mind your damn business, Karen!\" Not worth it--so bad behavior in public goes uncorrected.Even when kids aren't involved, people's reaction more and more to public criticism/correction is to get belligerent and tell you to mind your business.replydghlsakjg 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Truly.I was at a park concert once, the kind where everyone is sitting, and there was a large family in front of me. One of the kids (around 12 I would guess, old enough in any case) kept standing up, roaming around, and generally blocking the view of the people behind him, even though he wasn't watching the show (he was literally munching on snacks and facing back in the crowd). I wouldn't have cared if he was excited, dancing, enjoying the show, but that was just not the case.I asked him if he could sit down so I could see. His dad immediately got in my face and demanded that I apologize to his son. He didn't leave until the police got involved.replynly 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Awful parents breed awful kids.replywatwut 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Genuinely, I am not terrified.

In interactions I had or seen with parents or kids, literally never did any parent yelled at me or anyone else for saying \"excuse me\" or \"that is mine\".But fundamentally, keeping control Iverson a kid is on parent and I don't think about bumping kids enough to form a sentence. I just expect parents to tell them cause it is their job and in this story, the parent in fact intervened.replyuoaei 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Sure, it's important to give them feedback. That's a different thing from merely thinking for them, however. A (brief) conversation about the effects they may have on others and the feelings they expect others to have would go a long way toward engendering more pro-social considerations.replykryogen1c 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > The way I explain this is, \"my job is not to protect my kids from harm, it's to protect them from irreparable harm.\"Another way to phrase this:Your job as a parent is to expose your children to the maximum amount of love that is healthy and the maximum amount of pain that is healthy.Too little or too much of either is possible and damaging.replyant6n 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >> The way I explain this is, \"my job is not to protect my kids from harm, it's to protect them from irreparable harm.\"I also like to protect my shit from harm.

As you note it leads to important social development, it improves creativity and could lead to much better academic performance into the teens according to the studies he showed me.When he designed a playground it wasn't \"here they can do A and there they can do B\", but he strived to provide spaces that facilitated spontaneous play. He wanted the kids to do their own thing, and provided as many options as possible. An important factor here is that kids enjoy different kinds of play. Not everyone wants to kick a ball, some want more social play so might need a space that allows for that, perhaps a secluded sitting group.However as you note safety is a big issue. He had a guiding principle of two kinds of safety. There's subjective saftey, if you're high up you know falling might hurt. This is what kids should learn, and it's important they get to do that without permanent injury.The second kind is objective safety, which relates to the environment and equipment, which facilitates this learning of subjective safety. There shouldn't be rocks near by equipment which could cause permanent injury if a kid fell of the equipment. There shouldn't be gaps in the swing attachment where a kid could lose a finger, and so on.replykajaktum 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Whenever this kind of opinion props up I wonder how far would you let your child to \"fail\"? Clearly we need our children to stumble and fail in a low-stake environment before they actually experience them later on in life. This naturally involves taking some risk. I remember being able to walk freely around the village pretty much without any supervision, I did get hurt a lot either from running into walls or getting scratches from sword play. The problem I see is that modern people have absolutely zero tolerance for \"failure\" in this regard. Clearly I could have been kidnapped, fallen into the river, fall from a tall tree, got run over by the cows or whatever. Let's face it, this comes with risk. But modern society can't seem to tolerate even a single dead children. Is that for the better? Maybe? But I think trying this has a long term cost. Trying to min/max risk taking and maintaining absolutely zero children suffer is just not going to work. We'll probably lose on both ends.Note: I have no children nor do I plan to. Exactly because I have no idea how to deal with them nor do I want them to suffer being with me lolreplyjeremyjh 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, I grew up in a small town and pretty much had the run of it from the age of 6 or 7, and quite a lot of freedom even before that.

With my own kids I'm less protective than a lot of parents in my neighborhood but I wouldn't really be comfortable with that, certainly not at that age and even if I was none of their friends would be allowed to do that, most kids stay on their block or cul-de-sac.replyseszett 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > modern society can't seem to tolerate even a single dead childrenYou mean parents can't seem to tolerate even a single dead child.

I wouldn't put demolishing the playground outside of the realm of possibility.> Obviously they don't want them to die. To parents, their children aren't an abstract idea or a number that they can rationalize away.Yea and this is why this is quite interesting to think about for me. In a way, perhaps it is better that failures to happen in small numbers many times, instead of 1 big societal level failure that only need to happen once. I think part of the problem is that people have access to global news today. Even 1 children choking on some candy or whatever from the other side of the globe would mean that every children would be stripped of this experience.replyborski 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Imagine the reaction of a modern day town if a child had broke their neck from the playground, what would the reaction?This is extremely locale-dependent.

My parents were children before WWII and both came from large families—there were seven siblings on each side. On the other hand my generation had typically two kids.It would be ludicrous to suggest that my grandparents didn't love their kids or care as much about them given their numbers but the fact is—put brutally—there was considerable solace in having 'spares'.Today, it is very easy to forget that prewar many more kids per capita never reached adulthood. Most people alive today have never known a time without penicillin or the pre-polio-vaccine days. People in those days were much more fatalistic about life and the lives of their kids as life back then was considerably more 'fragile'. Today, we expect our kids to reach adulthood and outlive us, back then most hoped that would happen but they were more circumspect about it. When a kid died of course parents would be terribly upset but when it happened they always knew there was more chance of it happening than just a remote possability.I noticed this fatalism in my grandparents, especially my grandmother, she came from a big family and she had a big family and in both cases some kids died before reaching adulthood.replyred-iron-pine 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] except when someone shoots up their school, it seemsreplyseszett 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't understand what you mean, but I might be missing something since school shootings aren't a thing here.Are you saying that parents don't care when their children are killed in a school shooting?replyGerard0 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Of course we told (many times) our 3 yr old son not to put his hand on the stove.And one day he just had to try it and feel what all these stories were about.

Too much bubble wrap and they maybe will crumble in face of adversity, too much neglect and they will get their attention from elsewhere.

Someone wrote that first you are the authority figure and the lighthouse for love and safety, then you become more of a mentor as they grow up.Again, the best you can hope for is that they learn good enough values and let them live their lives, it’s THEIR LIVES, not yours and maybe they will come to you for help.

I think an important skill in life is to actually predict and understand danger ahead of time. As in, a knife won't just give you a bruise, it could be easily fatal if used in even the most mildly wrong way. Falling/jumping from great heights isn't something to just experiment with and try. Running in a busy street isn't something to try just to understand the dangers. Running up to an American bison isn't something to just try and see what happens. Etc.replyevandale 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Some of these dangers are relative though. A 6 foot fall for a toddler is probably not going to kill them but relative to the size of the kid it's a great height they can experiment with. A 10 foot drop for an 8 year old is a great height to them but they'll survive.The bison example, I would think any child would be very wary of walking up to a bison. On top of that, if a child were to approach a bison I highly doubt the bison would come out with full offensive. They'd probably assume a defensive posture to scare the kid away. If the kid kept coming you should keep in mind that mammals recognize babies of other mammals. It would be pretty extraordinary for the bison to consider a human child as a threat and attack them.The cars though, yeah. I don't even want to get into that.replybmitc 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not that the particular example even matters, but bison have absolutely attacked both children and adults and have killed a handful of people. I won't post the videos, but you can find the bison attacking even children on YouTube. In one instance, the child seemed fine, but the horn moving an inch to the left or right could have gored the kid.The point is that you are at their mercy and that it takes training and education to understand and predict that danger ahead of time. Even adults are ignorant along these lines. Everything is a spectrum, but there is a threshold, in my opinion, in which the probabilities of disaster become 100% out of your control for certain activities.For example, you can watch this guy on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV1fzwfJpmQ who appears to be calm and an \"expert\" on interacting with bears. However, you can also watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqwYUkJYRQc in which a grizzly shows absolutely insane stamina and strength, covering huge distances of rough terrain and water. It means that the guy in the previous video is 100% at complete mercy of the bear, no matter what he says. (As an aside, I'm actually surprised that guy hasn't had more trouble, as he clearly seeks out bear encounters.)I think my larger point is that part of the education of both children and adults is teaching to understand and ultimately respect the reality in which we live in. Animals, physics, biology, etc. all exist and we must live within those rules and understand the consequences of pushing them. I can't go jump into the sun just to try it out. And a project manager stating a schedule as if it dictates reality doesn't mean it does. Lol.

Ideally, they learn what a hoof to the face feels like BEFORE they start working with, say, horses.I guess my point is that anyone who needs to train safety totally understands how important it is for someone to understand the specific danger intimatelyreplyem-bee 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] i expect that they start with showing them how to use the knives first.montessori teaches 3 year olds how to properly handle sharp knives by letting them cut the fruits for snack breaks. they also don't use safety scissors but learn how to use real scissors.a lot of danger is removed by teaching kids how to properly use tools. when they feel how the knife cuts through the fruit, they learn that a knife has a sharp edge, and can cut things.my son learned to cook at age 8 or 9. yes, he gets burned sometimes, but he knows how to properly use a gas stove and he has learned to be careful with it because he had the opportunity to use it frequently and become familiar with it. he can cook a meal unsupervised, and i guess that will boost his confidence as he tries more complex recipes.replyHWR_14 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > We know the toy will break if it's repeatedly thrown down the stairs, so we impose a rule that \"we don't do that in our house\"For many parents, the toy is expensive enough that it warrants a rule (like the stove.)replyWaterluvian 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's all relative.

I did an iPhone 12 battery last year. iFixit has those guides down to a science).Might work miracles at showing teens they can fix problems (even those that even their parents are scared of!), that repairing stuff isn’t that scary, and that $40ish can go quite a long way.replylfowles 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Indeed, it's not just that I'm anxious the toy will break.

While them breaking the item may have changed the equation, generally it doesn't. In real life if you accidentally break something, you replace it and move on. If the child is old enough perhaps have the replacement come out of their allowance/have them do something in exchange, but if they are too young to take care of the issue themselves, they are too young to be responsible for taking care of the issue.replyem-bee 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] well, i might make that determination for a laptop used for school, but surely not for a thing to play computer games or watch tv. if that breaks there is unlikely to be a new one for at least a year.replylfowles 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I've tried preaching philosophy to my toddler but he just doesn't seem to get it for some reason :) Some toys do get \"broken\" (but easily fixed so they reappear in a week or more), but out of sight means out of mind!

I have a cat though. She's the first pet I've ever had in my life.I got lots of warnings from lots of people. Don't let her out or she'll cry all the time to go out. Keep her away from the door or she'll run out and you won't see her again. It sounded very difficult.However I didn't follow this advice and let my cat out in my backyard. And I found out that people were right and she does cry to go out all the time.At the start. So I ignored her. I didn't even tell her to be quiet. I let her whine and cry as much as she wanted. She was 100% fine and had everything she needed except the ability to go outside.She started to scratch the screen to voice her displeasure. I'm the boss and so she lost screen door privileges. She tried to negotiate but failed horribly because, again, I am the boss. She is a cat. The next weekend she got screen door privileges back and scratched the screen on day 2. She lost them again because I'm the boss and I don't want her to scratch my screen. When she got her screen privileges back again she never scratched the screen again.The door thing, same. She snuck out once. Then I started locking her in a safe room with everything she needed. It's still her room to this day and she can trash it as much as she wants, just like she could as a kitten. That's the only room she can do that and seems to understand that. She doesn't really come near the door if I'm leaving now, and if she's close she will not try sneaking out.She just turned two this past month, and while she was a nightmare as a kitten, she is a complete angel now.I'm not totally perfect and for example I can't keep her off my desk if it's in the sitting position. So I've learned to deal with it. If I don't want her on my desk I need to either keep her out of my office or use it standing. I can't seem to win this battle and I tried everything. I'll say that not buying a kid a new iPad seems like a much easier thing to do.I'm sure children are a lot different but the \"I can't teach children philosophy\" excuse sounds pretty weak.

If I allow myself to be driven by that instinct however, they'll never be well equipped which does not make for a well rounded adult.

That is so true. Personal anecdote:When I got my first car as a teenager (a cheap, used, beat-up sedan), I would often take it out to 'play', ehm, 'test the world'. I lived in a rural area and would drive random, remote backroads for hours with no maps (and no cell phones at the time). I would try to see if I could get lost. I never succeeded. I was always able to eventually find my way, while I was simultaneously building spatial awareness and a general sense of direction that accompanies me to this day. The winter time gave me the best 'testing' environment. I would drive these backroads when they were icey and very slick. When I had certainty there was no traffic anywhere near, I would see how I handled my car when I lost control. A few rotations later, after spinning uncontrollably, I was able to regain steering and was able to navigate out of the problem.Risky? Sure. Useful skills? Yes. Would my parents have stressed out knowing what I was doing, definitely. I'd like to think I'm a much better driver today because of it and have gotten myself out of some potentially consequential accidents because of my awareness of how a vehicle handles when out of control.Many people learn from doing - many kids especially.

You learn how to make hard choices (you may need to replace a friend with another guildmate if they are holding the whole team back by failing game mechanics, etc.), how to lead a team, how people behave in stressful situations, how to keep the team together, and how to keep morale high, etc. So next time you see a kid playing WoW with others, don't underestimate the learning experience he will get there.replyatonse 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] We have really made it a point to have our kid play freely as much as possible and minimize scheduled activities (piano lessons etc.) the problem is that most of his friends are in a million classes so even if he’s free, they often aren’t.That’s been the big challenge.

Harvard still accepts ~2000 people, around the same as 40 years ago, even though demand has skyrocketed. That is basically leading to more and more competition over the same slots, same as the bidding wars in the housing market.

You have to get on people's calendars a week or two out whenever you can, and if you're lucky, it eventually turns into easy, low-stress, open-ended playdates.Meeting other parents is a huge effort, though! It's basically dating all over again. If your kids ride the school bus, that's a big help because you automatically meet nearby parents who are home in the afternoon. Otherwise, you have to go to lots of events and ask parents for their phone numbers, but the majority don't work out for random reasons.replygenocidicbunny 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think the parent is not so much complaining that it's doable, more that the concept of play dates as a thing at all is what's infuriating. I agree with this as well.When I was young, my parents knew the parents of maybe one or two of my friends, and that was only largely because they knew each other from somewhere else. We didn't need to have our parents organize and sync up their schedules to go play together. We'd just go and meet up. If no one was around outside, might go up and knock on the door of a few friends see if they wanted to do something. But ultimately, we had largely free reign to ourselves.Now, at a later age, I also really wouldn't want to have to get to know the parents of my kids' friends either. Meet once or twice to get to see them face-to-face, maybe get some basic contact info just in case, but for the most part, I don't really want my kids' social relationships to be based on how well I can get along with other parents (with a few small exceptions.)replyjackcosgrove 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I used to think parents who overscheduled their kids were reacting to incentives put in place by college admissions offices and secondary selective admissions schools, and ultimately employers who demand elite credentials.But as I've studied this issue and experienced life, it seems to be the case that credentials are in reality overrated compared to competence and experience. The vast majority of colleges will admit anyone, and the vast majority of employers requiring a degree just ask that you have a degree of any kind.So now I think parents should just chill, not because it's the altruistic strategy in game theory, but because that's how the actual labor market works.

But of course, even with added downtime, those kids are more academically competitive, so they end up ratcheting up the standards in the area they go to.replytaeric 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Depends. If you think it is just diminishing returns, than you always get more the more you put in. Just not as much. You have to drop to negative returns for that to go away.And indeed, in that framing, it is going to be tough to make it so that those who can afford to spend their time shouldn't do so.So, are there policies where we could make it so that folks can put a legit value in the things they are neglecting for this extra spend in time? I can certainly hope so.replyem-bee 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Korea had to pass a law saying that private academies have to close at 10pmsimilarly, china banned private afterschool services for school subjects. i don't know how effective the ban is, but their argument was similar.replygrey413 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Things like this are actually some of the main reasons I'm moving my family to Europe.

Music lessons didn't get invented in the past two decades. Nor did school/college prep.

Of course someone will be more successful at doing thing x if they are scheduled to do thing x.That is good for planning/preparing for the future.Being scheduled to the gills means that the ‘now’ is constantly filled with planning/preparing/doing things for the future though.And with no time for the present or for being able to think/daydream.replytaeric 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm not confusing it. I'm questioning if people are really more scheduled today.Especially as we get to middle and high school. Many of us had jobs back then.

It's mostly grades that decide who get's into college and bologna affirms that you have a free choice on where to attend.

But I don’t think parents-overscheduled activities help that much with it. Otherwise discipline goes out the window when nobody is on your shoulder anymore.Learning to live self sufficiently is better with unstructured time IMO. When you have to learn to put together your own schedule, follow it and do day-to-day tasks. It’s horrible how many kids can’t make themselves dinner and clean up the house after themselves.

When she saw there was still someone there (an out of shape nerd who looks like a Best Buy worker—the opposite of intimidating) just holding a package, she let out a shriek from the depths of damnation, and basically stood there screaming until I set the package down and walked away.

There’s no expectation of entertaining guests if you pop in for a visit.replylotsofpulp 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I feel like a literal pop in does not work for many people due to mobile phones and suburbs. Suburbs make it so you have to go at least a little out of your way to visit someone, which means you might as well call to make sure they are available before wasting your time on a detour.Although, I see no problem with impromptu visits, I get them all the time. They just happen to call or text before coming.replySoftTalker 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agree.

There's a time and a place to teach them financial responsability, I feel distracting them with financial concerns during their most challenging years of schooling is not it.When I went to college (paid for by my parents), I had friends who had to work on the side to pay for rent and groceries. They barely hung by, very few had great grades since they had to split their time between work and study. One of my close friends ended up dropping out because he was burned out.Of course this doesn't mean you should pay 50k for a degree in feminist dance therapy, you make sure you only pay for something with ROI (That's another thing I don't understand about Americans.

But also I think that as long as you have a realistic plan and are able to consistently work on it early (I started learning web dev at 8) you can mostly disregard the standard education and progression systems. I think that railroading a child through the systems without a plan is wasted effort. Not that there aren't good things to learn that way. I ended up learning a ton about art and art history thanks to my college's degree requirements.I guess what I'm saying is you can throw a child into extracurriculars and just sort of hope the extra work makes the difference between comfort and struggling.

I never really had any monitoring on how I spent my time, for better or worse, but that reality allowed me to kind of chase interests (or ignore interests) and cultivate a lot of passion and curiosity. My sister's mother was the exact opposite. She prioritized \"getting to be a mom\" over my sister's time and enjoyment, so she became a Scout Leader, Soccer Coach, Ballet Coordinator, Cheer Coach etc. and had my sister join all of those activities. Every day was school from 7-whenever, straight to dance, straight to homework, straight to bed. I don't think my sister ever had more than an hour or two free for her entire childhood. The outcome is kind of wild. She's an anxiety mess, overly controlling, but also unable to really think for herself or prioritize her interests (maybe because she doesn't have a ton?), and usually just takes the path of least resistance or that she's been told to take.

The more people wall themselves away into their castles in the suburbs, the less they feel part of a community, and the more they distrust others.replycloverich 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In theory I agree. But in practice, where I grew up, it was pure suburbia. I lived a few miles from school. No sidewalks, and roads very car centric. In elementary and Jr high I used to bike to school, regularly, and I don't remember it being abnormal; I remember a lot of kids doing it. I remember my dad commenting on it being weird that there was a crossing guard we had to wait for on our school corner (which crossed a 4 lane busy-ish street) on one of the rare days where he picked us up in his car.I think a big part of this is just our risk tolerances change. We naturally want to protect kids, and looking historically we've taken safety to relative extremes compare to 20 years ago (and similarly before then). Its natural to want more security, and its obvious how it helps. But its not as obvious what we've given up in return.Interestingly, I moved to Portland recently, and live mid way between suburbs and downtown; its fairly dense but mostly SFH or townhomes in my neighborhood, many businesses, some homeless. Kids of all ages walk to school and are... just everywhere, around here. Its quite normal to see people walking with their kids too. Its just got a really great mix of urban density -- you can walk to stores, bars, school. There's a few high traffic streets, but they are not large and the speed limit is 20mph. I think what this neighborhood has taught me is, while our risk tolerances are lower than ever, its still a bit of a design and culture choice to not let kids walk around. Its nice to see here, in Portland of all places, there's a bit of a counter trend going on. I hope its what the future looks like in other places (here and elsewhere) too.replyNegativeLatency 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Cars as we know and use them have only been around for 100 years, which is very little time compared to say the evolution of the human brain.replySoftTalker 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Kids needed to learn to look out for lions and snakes though.replydeanmoriarty 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] Wow, this is so sad. I grew up in Europe in the 90s with parents who pretty much let me do whatever I wanted as long as I was a well-behaved child/teenager and getting reasonable school grades.At 6 years old I was literally biking by the river or wandering in the woods with my friends after school for hours on end. Every day was an exciting adventure without any adult supervision, just random groups of 2-10 kids who would gather in the afternoon to play together. The rule was \"home by dinner or there won't be any dinner for you\". I never did any extracurricular activity, ever.This did not prevent me from going to a great university in my country, get my master in Computer Engineering, graduating in the top 5% of my class, have a curriculum good enough to legally immigrate to the US, and working at several tech companies including FAANG, making high 6 figures now.I would never give away those wonderful memories and early life experiences for some random extracurricular activity just to \"stand out\" later on, I do believe such freedom helped form my character to a much greater extent than any scripted activity would have.replyhiAndrewQuinn 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] You're going to have to be somewhat careful or forward thinking to keep those same benefits for your kids going forward, I'm afraid.

Letting them have some unstructured, unsupervised time, especially out in the neighborhood.2. Not automatically doing or thinking for them, especially by answering advice questions with questions that encourage reflection and independent decision-making.3. Expect them to help with chores and needs self-service, pushing back against the expectation that parents are the forever barbers, waiters, and maids while the kids are on permanent vacation.replycarabiner 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Helicopter parenting is bad until it gets your kid into Cornell.

I also grew up in the 90s.In my experience, in higher education the prestige of the school has a smaller impact on learning than most people seem to think. Mostly, it seems to function as networking and a badge on your resume which can open the next door.But once you have a bit of experience, more doors will open. In a few years, people care more about what you worked with than what school you went to, even if it’s an Ivy for instance.Plus, working at smaller companies is a much faster way to learn than faang, imo. Sure, you get good at politics, perf reviews, and learn some best practices, but in terms of domain knowledge and practicing decision making, faang is terribly inefficient for “growth”. I wish I had worked more at smaller companies/freelancing, because frankly most of big corp was a waste of time (although money is good).replyred-iron-pine 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > (although money is good).what is the point of growth if not to make more money?you could quit your faang job and work as a janitor while hacking projects on the side if so inclined. except one has a pathway to 500k+ and the other does not.replyklabb3 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > what is the point of growth if not to make more money?I’d definitely swap those two, for life in general. (Depending on what you mean by growth, which is why I quoted it, because I don’t really subscribe to the implicitly assumed linear progression model.)Anyway, I’d be the first to say money is important, because of what it lets you do. Similarly, the potential of earning money in the future (should it be needed) provides financial safety, and having faang on resume helps with that. But money also has an aggressive diminishing returns curve for what most people do with it, including me.A lot of young people are concerned that they have to be competitive early to not have doors close on them, which is what I’m arguing is less true than they are mostly told. Especially for tech. So I was mainly arguing that sacrificing childhood to be molded in the senseless game of early credentialsm and extracurriculars is a tactically meh choice in most cases, and that’s excluding the emotional abuse itself.> you could quit your faang job and work as a janitor while hacking projects on the side if so inclined.Already did :) except the janitor part.replymedvezhenok 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This is a really good point that people miss.

EXPLORE:QUICK GUIDESSMARTER BALANCED TEST SCORES FOR 2022 Donate Subscribe TOPICS PROJECTS & INVESTIGATIONS AUDIO & VIDEO COMMENTARIES DATA PUBLICATIONS ABOUT EDSOURCE California moves to silence Stanford researchers who got state data to study education issues ACLU says contract blocking legal testimony violates First Amendment POLICY & FINANCE JULY 28, 2023 JOHN FENSTERWALD 6 COMMENTS REPUBLISH CREDIT: LOUIS FREEDBERG / EDSOURCE The California Department of Education building in Sacramento.The California Department of Education has threatened to sue two prominent Stanford University education professors to prevent them from testifying in a lawsuit against the department — actions the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California calls an attempt to muzzle them. The ACLU, in turn, is threatening a lawsuit of its own — against CDE for infringing their and other researchers’ First Amendment rights. Observers say the dispute has the potential to limit who conducts education research in California and what they are able to study because CDE controls the sharing of data that is not available to the public.At issue is a restriction that CDE requires researchers to sign as a condition for their gaining access to nonpublic K-12 data. The clause, which CDE is interpreting broadly, prohibits the researcher from participating in any litigation against the department, even in cases unrelated to the research they were doing through CDE.  “It keeps education researchers from weighing in on the side of parties who are adverse to the California Department of Education. So it’s really skewing the information and expertise that can come into courts,” said Alyssa Morones, an ACLU attorney involved with the case. “Individuals and students seeking to vindicate their rights no longer will have access to these education experts, and the court can no longer hear what they have to say.”Court brief: State failed to lead academic recoveryProfessors Sean Reardon and Thomas Dee had signed separate and unrelated data-partnership agreements with the department, and both were asked by attorneys in an ongoing lawsuit, Cayla J. v. State of California, to testify on behalf of students filing the case. The lawsuit, against the California Department of Education, the State Board of Education and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, charges the state with failing to prevent the deep learning loss imposed by the pandemic on low-income students and other high-needs students. Reardon, who had co-authored landmark nationwide research on pandemic learning, said he would have considered providing expert testimony. But warned this month by CDE that he’d be breaching his contract, Reardon declined — even though his learning loss research did not involve the data obtained through his agreement with CDE.STAY UP-TO-DATE Sign-up below to receive breaking news alerts from EdSource by text message.Dee, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Stanford, agreed to serve as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Cayla J. case on the effects of Covid-19 on enrollment, chronic absenteeism and student engagement in California. This month, he was one of a half-dozen nationally prominent education professors who filed briefs in the case. In it, Dee cited data on enrollment declines and chronic absenteeism. He concluded, “Because of both its comprehensive data systems and its powerful fiscal and operational capacities, the state of California is in a unique position to provide leadership in better understanding and meeting the serious challenges of academic recovery. However, to date, the state has not clearly demonstrated such leadership, instead emphasizing responses by local school districts.”CDE moved against Dee even though the data contract he had signed on behalf of a Stanford program was for research unrelated to the Cayla J. case. On Feb.24, after CDE discovered that Dee had filed the brief, the department warned Dee that he had violated the contract he had signed in February 2022 as the chief investigator for the John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities at Stanford. As a result, the letter said, CDE was suspending the data partnership and demanding that Dee “mitigate further damage.” The department would consider seeking an injunction to prevent him from participating in the Cayla J. case along with a $50,000 fine. “Also, be aware,” wrote Cindy Kazanis, the director of CDE’s Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division, “that your actions have adversely impacted your working relationship with CDE, and your response to this letter is critically important to existing and future collaborations between us.” The letter was copied to Stanford. The contract that Dee signed with CDE is to examine how the California School Dashboard was affecting alternative schools serving those at risk of dropping out and those with motivation and behavior issues. He said he signed the contract in his capacity as faculty director of the Gardner Center, but had not actually looked at any of the data. Dee said he relied on publicly available data in writing his brief for the Cayla J. case. He declined to comment further on the case. The dispute is now in the courts. The plaintiffs’ attorneys in Cayla J., the public interest law firm Public Counsel and Morrison Foerster, a San Francisco-based law firm doing pro bono work, are asking a Superior Court judge to allow Dee’s participation in this case and protect him from CDE’s penalties — but only in this particular lawsuit. A hearing is scheduled early next week in Alameda Superior Court. The ACLU filed a brief on Feb. 27 supporting Dee’s participation in the Cayla J. case. But meanwhile, it took the first steps toward a larger lawsuit to eliminate CDE’s litigation prohibition. ‘What are state officials afraid of?’Michael Jacobs, an attorney with Morrison Foerster, said he was disappointed that the state would attempt to block education experts from giving their expertise. “The futures of the least advantaged schoolchildren in California are at issue. The data these experts utilized are all public.”“What are state officials afraid of?” Jacobs said. “That their performance in running the school system during the pandemic in fact aggravated the achievement gap? That notwithstanding their protestations, they haven’t done enough to address that problem?”CDE declined to comment on the need for the litigation ban in data contracts or its threats and actions against Dee or Reardon. Researchers told EdSource they were unaware of similar prohibitions in other states, but EdSource could not verify that. In a July 7 letter, the ACLU gave the department 10 days to expunge the restriction from all contracts with researchers. In a one-sentence defense a week later, Len Garfinkel, general counsel for CDE, stated, ”In our view, the Department’s data protection agreements are compliant with law.”ACLU hasn’t revealed when it might take its next step. ACLU’s focus was a separate five-year research contract that the department signed in 2018 and updated in 2020 with the Learning Policy Institute, a Palo Alto-based nonprofit education research organization.The next-to-the-last clause in the 11-page document, titled “Interests adverse to the California Department of Education,” states that as long as the contract is in effect, “LPI’s employees, executives, and other representatives shall not voluntarily testify for, consult with, or advise a party in conjunction with any mediation, arbitration, litigation, or other similar legal proceeding where LPI knows that party is adverse to the CDE, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction or the State Board of Education.”  In addition, if anyone covered by the contract does become involved in litigation, CDE can immediately revoke the contract and demand all the data be returned or destroyed. LPI and signers of the agreement would be subject to a fine. That’s the same wording as in Dee’s contract through the Gardner Center. Linda Darling-Hammond among contract signersReardon, professor of poverty and inequality in education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education as well as a senior research fellow at LPI, signed that contract, along with 15 others, mainly LPI employees and researchers. Signing as the principal investigator was Linda Darling-Hammond, LPI’s president and CEO. She also is the president of the state board and an adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom. She signed the original agreement a year before Newsom nominated her to the state board. The ACLU, acting on its own, asserted the provision is clearly unconstitutional. A government can set restrictions for granting access to nonpublic data for research purposes, but not to limit a researcher’s First Amendment right of free speech, it said in its nine-page letter to the department. What’s “even ‘more blatant and more egregious,’” the ACLU wrote, citing a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision, is the department’s “viewpoint discrimination.” The contract doesn’t ban an education researcher from testifying for the department in a lawsuit; it just can’t testify against it.“Viewpoint discrimination is poison to a free society,”  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a different high court opinion in a 2019 case that the ACLU also cited in its letter. Morones, who wrote the ACLU letter, said the prohibition is far more broad than the government needs to protect its data. As shown by the department’s response in the Cayla J. lawsuit, the department could apply the provision to thwart LPI and anyone who signed the contract from participating in any litigation against the department, the state board and the state superintendent, Thurmond, she said.The Education Recovery Scorecard, the learning loss research that Reardon co-authored, relies on publicly available data from California and 39 other states, and, Reardon said, does not use any data provided to the LPI for its research project. Reardon’s project with LPI  is focused on the pre-pandemic success of English learners in California from 2006 to 20-19.Researchers rely on partnership agreementsResearchers seek agreements with the department to access nonpublic data, especially student-level data that detail the demographic information and the performance records over time of California’s 5.8 million students but without any names or identifying information. That data is the gold standard for accurate research. A partnership contract details the department’s commitments and researchers’ responsibilities, including strong assurances they will have security protections in place to protect students’ privacy and anonymity.The dispute does not involve the disclosure of any student-level information.Maria Clayton, the director of communications for CDE, said the agreement “is standard language that CDE has used for years in these types of data-sharing agreements.”Reardon said in an email, “It’s perfectly appropriate – even necessary – that CDE or any state agency ensure student privacy and factual correctness when the state’s data is used by external researchers. It is unclear to me, however, how restricting researchers’ freedom to testify in a lawsuit, even an unrelated one, serves the interests of California’s students.” “The restriction does not make research better,” he added,  “and does nothing that I can see to protect student privacy. It may limit which researchers are willing or able to work with the state, leaving the state without access to some of the best researchers; and it may limit the effectiveness of litigation that might benefit California’s students.”No restrictions on what researchers can publishThe contract does not impose any restrictions on researchers’ ability to independently report what they learn from the data.Patrick Shields, the executive director of LPI, said the department doesn’t interfere in how researchers report on their findings. And since LPI is a research organization that does not engage in litigation, it is not affected by the restriction not to testify against the state.“We don’t feel restrictions on portraying data as it is. There have been no internal discussions (with the department) that we can’t say this or that,” he said.   But researchers seek access to analyze data without knowing what they will discover. LPI’s contract with the department, which it calls the California Equity Project, covers a range of topics that have already generated and will produce dozens of studies on teacher shortages, teacher and administrator professional development, homeless students, English learners, foster youths and K-12 achievement and funding gaps.Studies using a wide swath of data could lead to legislation, or it could also prompt advocacy organizations like Public Counsel and the ACLU to pursue remedies through the courts to fix flaws in state laws or address poor student performance or inequities in funding. ACLU argues that preventing researchers from sharing their expertise with the plaintiffs would be prior restraint and deny the public a full and fair presentation of the issues.For this and other reasons, David Plank, the retired executive of Policy Analysis for California Education or PACE, a collaborative research and policy organization based at Stanford and several other universities, said he “would never have signed a contract in which we agreed to protect the interests or reputation of the agency with which we would have signed.” To do so, he said, would be “contrary to the fundamental norms of academic research.”To get more reports like this one, click here to sign up for EdSource’s no-cost daily email on latest developments in education.Republish this article SHARE ARTICLE John Fensterwald writes about education policy and its impact in California.

As yet more can be inferred from public data (eg home address, rough estimates at parental income, etc.). This was back in the day. I'm sure now it's much worse.Most of the questions you want to ask about education are about treatments and outcomes. If these treatments (eg extra-curriculars) and outcomes (eg attended college, graduated HS, etc) are public then you can often figure out which student corresponds to each supposedly anonymous data-point.Maybe not perfectly. But way more than you would think. It's like the statistics version of those little logic puzzles from grade school -- \"Four people have red hair. Five are girls and two are boys. Billy and Sally are chewing gum. Boy gum chewers have brown hair. No one over 5 has red hair. Sally is 4. etc. etc. etc. Match each person's name with their hair color.\".

It’s just what CA considers deidentified and if it’s still useful enough to these researchers. For the topic they are researching it should be pretty straightforward to remove PII enough to protect individuals and only remove some really unique characteristics (ie, only a single 20 year old or a particular race and ethnicity).But I’m guessing age groups by race and gender and socioeconomic are possible to preserve without tying back to an individual.

This obviates the above concern, since the researchers won't need to compromise themselves in order to get exclusive access to data that allows them to be expert witnesses and rake in $$$$.But the problem with that proposal is re-identification: if we can't make the data anonymous, then we all agree that it shouldn't be released (implicit in the \"anonymized, of course!\" caveat to \"just release all the data\" proposal).Then you pointed out that even for more important data like healthcare data, FDA apparently has ways of allowing release of data that takes into account the risk of re-identification risk (I didn't know this; thanks for sharing!)Then dragonwriter and you got deep into the weeds on HIPPA stuff.TBH I have no idea which of you is most correct here. But anyways, there are two ways for this conversation to go:1. You are correct, good enough anonymization is possible: Stanford researchers should not be silenced; it is problematic that they have access to data other people cannot access, but the correct solution is to negate the originally problematic distinction between those researchers and the general public by making data public. Then there is no reason for the researchers to agree to these contract clauses, because they will have access to the data.2. dragonwriter is correct, good enough anonymization is not possible: We can go back up to the top-level concern and observe that \"just release all the data with anonymization\" isn't a feasible solution to this problem. Or maybe there isn't actually a problem here at all. IDK. But in any case, \"obviate the problem in the top-level post by releasing anonymized data\" isn't a workable solution.Again, not following closely enough to have an opinion, but that's where we are now.I think a good compromise position is that we should have a law stating that K12 data should be available to certain education researchers -- subject to IRB approval and so on -- without any other strings attached. Including \"don't sue me\" clauses in releases of public data sets does feel like an inappropriate abuse of student privacy concerns.replynradov 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The researchers don't have a trusted relationship with schools. They have a contractual relationship with the state government.

In practice, you can often re-identify individuals even in an anonymized dataset. For example, if you're dealing with a very rare disease, or a small minority group, you can usually figure out an anonymized row of data is referring to if you really try.

The entire dataset of course because it’s everyone’s student records.

Education researchers want to aggregate and statistically sample the data in new ways; pre-aggregating it removes most ability to do so. If you want to do a principal component analysis of a few variables-- good luck with aggregate data.If you provide nearly any data at the student-level, there's a pretty high chance that it can be deanonymized.At the same time, the state's position of attempting to prevent education researchers from participating in litigation (when using only public, non-restricted data) is egregious.replyprepend 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’m talking about perturbing the micro data enough to allow researchers to answer their questions while remaining analytically valuable.For example with school attendance data you could easy release a dataset at the county level with every student’s record with unique generated student id, race, grade, gender, absences by year (or even month) and still have 5-20 of each category to be able to show attendance trends before and after Covid without being able to identify individuals. And, if necessary, suppress really unique race or gender instances (eg, maybe there’s only one trans, Native American in a school) while still being useful enough to make useful findings for general trends.I don’t know what specific questions, but the state not releasing any data to them and claiming privacy is silly.The census and department of ed already do this and the department of ed has a very useful description of how they apply privacy protections and validate that data are sufficiently anonymized for public release, https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_d...replymlyle 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > For example with school attendance data you could easy release a dataset at the county level with every student’s record with unique generated student id, race, grade, gender, absences by year (or even month) and still have 5-20 of each category to be able to show attendance trends before and after Covid without being able to identify individuals.Yes, for any kind of specific study you want to do, you can form aggregates that support it. Indeed, lots of aggregate data is already released publicly.Lots of aggregate data is already released publicly.If you want the actual, real data, so you can answer questions like --- \"what about attendance on Mondays in students receiving subsidized lunch-- what does it predict about that student's attendance in the future?\" --- you'll either need the real data, or for the state to basically do your data aggregation for your specific question.replyamalcon 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The word \"anonymized\" needs to be excised from our collective vocabulary. \"Anonymization\" is not a thing that can be meaningfully done to a dataset about individuals.

The privacy issue is a huge red herring, used to co-opt well meaning people like you.I requested data about STAR, the California standardized test used for Lowell's admissions. I wanted rows of the form (randomized student ID, STAR question ID, answered correctly), however they were recorded, and literally nothing more.They rejected the request because (1) they claimed such records didn't exist, which makes no sense because how exactly did they administer the test then; and (2) because standardized testing is carved out, in their opinion, from the related sunshine law.Why did I want these records? I wanted to show that scoring well on tests and using them to gate admissions doesn't mean what people think it means. Specifically, that if you administered the test Lowell used (STAR) by hardest question first, then terminated the test after the student gets N (close to 1) questions wrong, you would select nearly the same list of students. Only asking the vast majority of students only e.g. 1 question, which they all get wrong, can't possibly measure how much they study, how comprehensive their knowledge is, etc. But these claims are routinely made in defense of the test and its purpose in selecting a class. This is coming from someone who wants test based admissions.So clearly political, right? I had to carefully word my request around all these conclusions. If you read the CDE's requirements, they really have specific political goals. You either align with them or you don't. And I tried to work around that, and I stilled failed. They just looked at the absence of a political bent, and correctly concluded that it wasn't evidence of absence.If you want to do good, politically impactful educational research: run your own school. That's what the CDE wants you to do. It's not about discovering how to improve public schools.replychaps 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not sure it's fair to say it's a red herring, or that I'm \"co-opted\" like you suggest.

People still keep sending their kids to private schools. I just don't know how much it matters.They surely care about privacy in their internal research and metrics, but they don't employ a full time Privacist. They might employ someone who checks the right boxes for them and deals with FERPA shit. But because they are aligned with the parents in delivering the best educations, for the most part, they are trusted to do with data what they want, and that sometimes includes inviting outside collaborators to look at it, without anywhere near the same faff as the CDE.If you're a journalist and you want to help a private school make a better education, out of the thousands of private schools, one of them will both let you write about it and also tell them something they don't wanna hear. Some might use privacy or whatever as the reason they don't want to collaborate with you, but on average it will be about trust.The CDE is never going to do that. There's only 1 CDE, and they are there to preserve the status quo.replychaps 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For sure :)Very similar things happen when investigating criminal cases. There's possibly hundreds or thousands of instances of some type of misconduct or improper arrest... but none of the defense attorneys with those sorts of cases will talk about it with the press because of the very real potential harms of talking with the press. Or the ones that do talk are too high level.. or they might have some ulterior motive like self-promotion. It's really hard to express how many issues are a direct result of lawyers understandably, but systematically not raising any public awareness about truly awful things.Have you tried getting your data through CPRA requests? I'm out in Illinois and our law is pretty decent and not super familiar with CA's public records nuance, but it's really worth a try. What I know though is that California CPRA officers get away with a strange amount of abuse of the law. But even with that, you might be surprised what records are available. So if you do submit some requests, don't exactly expect it to be easy or immediate. Expect to be stonewalled, and need to sue at some point though. But IME public record suits are pretty hands-off (except when they're not..). And most of the lawyers I've worked with are upfront about what they will and won't litigate over.One thing you'll find is that.. basically nobody is looking into most of the awful things you'd expect would have eyes. It's very likely you'll be the only one doing those requests, or incrementally identifying how to get what you want through multiple requests over months. But each step breaks new ground and turns into feedback loops if you can build a community around it.replyDylan16807 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If going until the student gets one or two of the hardest questions wrong is highly predictive of whether they get selected, that implies that students near the selection threshold are getting very few questions wrong, right?> Only asking the vast majority of students only e.g. 1 question, which they all get wrong, can't possibly measure how much they study, how comprehensive their knowledge is, etc.This seems like a strawman?Yes, a single question can't measure those things to a high degree of certainty.But if you have students that do poorly on all the hard questions, and students that do well on all the hard questions, then asking them a single hard question might be 80% predictive of what group they're in.Why is it bad for that percentage to be high?The reason the test has lots of questions is specifically to increase the predictive quality.

A partnership contract details the department’s commitments and researchers’ responsibilities, including strong assurances they will have security protections in place to protect students’ privacy and anonymity.\"The thing about this sort of data is, removing PII from the dataset doesn't make it fully or even sufficiently anonymous. If there's only one Pacific Islander student in the Shasta Union High School District then it's easy to figure out who that is by coming it with other public data.Quoting https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy :] Statistical organizations have long collected information under a promise of confidentiality that the information provided will be used for statistical purposes, but that the publications will not produce information that can be traced back to a specific individual or establishment. To accomplish this goal, statistical organizations have long suppressed information in their publications. For example, in a table presenting the sales of each business in a town grouped by business category, a cell that has information from only one company might be suppressed, in order to maintain the confidentiality of that company's specific sales.The clear justification for keeping this information private is that the government won't get sufficiently useful data without this promise. The United States Census Bureau released \"confidential\" information about draft evaders and Japanese-Americans; if you think they might do that again, perhaps you'll lie about some of the questions.People who receive this sort of information are required to take special care to maintain the needed level of anonymity.There's of course no reason why this should be used to muzzle researchers for completely unrelated fields.replyIronWolve 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] IMHO,Making the public pay for records, at high expense in a digital age is how the government limit information.

A while back my friend Sumana asked me an interesting question – why are these things so hard to learn about? Why do they seem so mysterious?For example, take DNS. We’ve been using DNS since the 80s (for more than 35 years!). It’s used in every website on the internet. And it’s pretty stable – in a lot of ways, it works the exact same way it did 30 years ago.But it took me YEARS to figure out how to confidently debug DNS issues, and I’ve seen a lot of other programmers struggle with debugging DNS problems as well. So what’s going on?Here are a couple of thoughts about why learning to troubleshoot DNS problems is hard.(I’m not going to explain DNS very much in this post, see Implement DNS in a Weekend or my DNS blog posts for more about how DNS works)a lot of the system is hiddenWhen you make a DNS request on your computer, the basic story is:your computer makes a request to a server called resolver the resolver checks its cache, and makes requests to some other servers called authoritative nameserversHere are some things you don’t see:the resolver’s cache. What’s in there? which library code on your computer is making the DNS request (is it libc getaddrinfo? if so, is it the getaddrinfo from glibc, or musl, or apple? is it your browser’s DNS code? is it a different custom DNS implementation?). All of these options behave slightly differently and have different configuration, approaches to caching, available features, etc. For example musl DNS didn’t support TCP until early 2023. the conversation between the resolver and the authoritative nameservers. I think a lot of DNS issues would be SO simple to understand if you could magically get a trace of exactly which authoritative nameservers were queried downstream during your request, and what they said. (like, what if you could run dig +debug google.com and it gave you a bunch of extra debugging information?) dealing with hidden systemsA couple of ideas for how to deal with hidden systemsjust teaching people what the hidden systems are makes a huge difference. For a long time I had no idea that my computer had many different DNS libraries that were used in different situations and I was confused about this for literally years. This is a big part of my approach. with Mess With DNS we tried out this “fishbowl” approach where it shows you some parts of the system (the conversation with the resolver and the authoritative nameserver) that are normally hidden I feel like it would be extremely cool to extend DNS to include a “debugging information” section. Like maybe it could be in the additional section and we could use TCP DNS so so that the response could include unlimited debug info? There’s probably prior art here that I don’t know about. confusing toolsEven though a lot of DNS stuff is hidden, there are a lot of ways to figure out what’s going on by using dig.For example, you can use dig +norecurse to figure out if a given DNS resolver has a particular record in its cache. 8.8.8.8 seems to return a SERVFAIL response if the response isn’t cached.here’s what that looks like for google.com$ dig +norecurse@8.8.8.8 google.com ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER>HEADER>HEADER<<-, flags:, OPT PSEUDOSECTION:, QUESTION SECTION:, ANSWER SECTION:) the spacing is weird (why is the no newline between OPT PSEUDOSECTION and QUESTION SECTION?) MSG SIZE rcvd: 47 is weird (are there other fields in MSG SIZE other than rcvd? what are they?) it says that there’s 1 record in the ADDITIONAL section but doesn’t show it, you have to somehow magically know that the “OPT PSEUDOSECTION” record is actually in the additional sectionIn general dig’s output has the feeling of a script someone wrote in an adhoc way that grew organically over time and not something that was intentionally designed.dealing with confusing toolssome ideas for improving on confusing tools:explain the output. For example I wrote how to use dig explaining how dig’s output works and how to configure it to give you a shorter output by default make new, more friendly tools. For example for DNS there’s dog and doggo and my dns lookup tool. I think these are really cool but personally I don’t use them because sometimes I want to do something a little more advanced (like using +norecurse) and as far as I can tell neither dog nor doggo support +norecurse. I’d rather use 1 tool for everything, so I stick to dig. Replacing the breadth of functionality of dig is a huge undertaking. make dig’s output a little more friendly. If I were better at C programming, I might try to write a dig pull request that adds a +human flag to dig that formats the long form output in a more structured and readable way, maybe something like this: $ dig +human +norecurse@8.8.8.8 google.comHEADER: opcode: QUERY status: NOERROR id: 11653 flags: qr ra records: QUESTION: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1QUESTION SECTION: google.com. IN AANSWER SECTION: google.com.21 IN A 172.217.4.206ADDITIONAL SECTION: EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512 This makes the structure of the DNS response more clear – there’s the header, the question, the answer, and the additional section.We’ve learned a lot about how to design more user friendly command line tools in the last 40 years and I think it would be cool to apply some of that knowledge to some of our older crustier tools.weird gotchasDNS has some weird stuff that’s relatively common to run into, but pretty hard to learn about if nobody tells you what’s going on. A few examples (there are more in some ways DNS can break:negative caching! (which I talk about in this talk) It took me probably 5 years to realize that I shouldn’t visit a domain that doesn’t have a DNS record yet, because then the nonexistance of that record will be cached, and it gets cached for HOURS, and it’s really annoying. differences in getaddrinfo implementations: until early 2023, musl didn’t support TCP DNS resolvers that ignore TTLs: if you set a TTL on your DNS records (like “5 minutes”), some resolvers will ignore those TTLs completely and cache the records for longer, like maybe 24 hours instead if you configure nginx wrong (like this), it’ll cache DNS records forever. how ndots can make your Kubernetes DNS slow dealing with weird gotchasI don’t have as good answers here as I would like to, but knowledge about weird gotchas is extremely hard won (again, it took me years to figure out negative caching!) and it feels very silly to me that people have to rediscover them for themselves over and over and over again.A few ideas:It’s incredibly helpful when people call out gotchas when explaining a topic. For example (leaving DNS for a moment), Josh Comeau’s Flexbox intro explains this minimum size gotcha which I ran into SO MANY times for several years before finally finding an explanation of what was going on. I’d love to see more community collections of common gotchas. For bash, shellcheck is an incredible collection of bash gotchas.One tricky thing about documenting DNS gotchas is that different people are going to run into different gotchas – if you’re just configuring DNS for your personal domain once every 3 years, you’re probably going to run into different gotchas than someone who administrates DNS for a domain with heavy traffic.A couple of more quick reasons:infrequent exposureA lot of people only deal with DNS extremely infrequently. And of course if you only touch DNS every 3 years it’s going to be harder to learn!I think cheat sheets (like “here are the steps to changing your nameservers”) can really help with this.it’s hard to experiment withDNS can be scary to experiment with – you don’t want to mess up your domain. We built Mess With DNS to make this one a little easier.that’s all for nowI’d love to hear other thoughts about what makes DNS (or your favourite mysterious technology) hard to learn.Want a weekly digest of this blog?

    "commentBody": "Why is DNS still hard to learn? (jvns.ca)409 points by TangerineDream 17  219 commentstristor 16 hours ago | next [–] I don't agree with this article. I think DNS is something few people take the time to learn, but it's not actually hard to learn. One of the great things about DNS is that the system itself will tell you about it's internal state in response to queries. It's very easy to inspect a DNS server for a known zone and understand how it works, and there's very good tooling that's free and widely available to do this (like dig).It's always been a big surprise to me that my DNS expertise is what seems to be most memorable for a lot of folks I've worked with through my career, when I don't believe I know anything mystical or special. DNS is extremely well standardized, the most common server and client implementations rigorously follow the standard, and it's very easy to inspect with free tooling. It just takes some effort and time to learn, but it's not really hard.replyjvns 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] Hello! I wrote this post and I have a couple of things to say about this \"DNS is not actually hard\" take. It took me many years to feel totally comfortable debugging DNS problems, and I wrote this post to explain why I think it was hard for me.I also used to think that \"no, actually, it's easy!\" was an encouraging response to \"this is hard to learn\". And I kind of get it! I love DNS! I think it is surprisingly simple in many ways, and I've written about that a lot, for example in https://implement-dns.wizardzines.com which shows you how to implement a toy DNS resolver from scratch in some pretty simple Python code.But over the years I've learned that \"no, it's easy to learn!\", instead of coming off as an encouraging comment (\"you can do it!\"), often gets received as \"no, it's not hard, actually the problem is that you're dumb\". Like, I've been confused about this for years, and you're telling me that, no, actually it's easy? Not that helpful!So I've stopped telling people that, and instead I put a huge amount of work into trying to understand _why_ people find certain things hard and work to help remove some of those barriers.replyanyfoo 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Maybe everyone sees this differently? Or maybe is more than one viewpoint to it.For example, if someone tells me that something is \"actually really simple\", and I did not get it yet, I tend to think that I likely (not certainly, but likely) have not found the right approach to that something yet, and once I found that way to look at it, things will resolve itself.But if people assure me that something is \"hard to learn\" or \"hard to get\", I'm rather suspecting that that thing is full of unwieldy complexity and/or unintuitive aspects, and unless I'm either up for the challenge (definitely the case sometimes), or learning it is crucial for achieving a certain goal (in which case it may turn out to be fun after all, even if still hard), I might think twice if I want to put the time and energy into it.In the case of DNS, which I've learned in the nineties, I found the principle simple and elegant, the tools and software unwieldy and sometimes arcane, and a large multitude of little details that are not strictly necessary for understanding and using DNS in basic ways, but that can get important when either debugging or working at scale.So, in the case of DNS, I'd say the answer is \"depends on how deep you want to go\", but don't shy away from the simple and elegant principle, even if the arcane software (it has gotten better, though) stands in the way.I think that matches the content of your article overall?replysaghm 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Maybe everyone sees this differently?

When someone does so while also touting their status among their peers due to their knowledge and talking about how anyone could do it by just putting in the work, it's not surprising that people might interpret that as implying that people who don't have the same knowledge are either too lazy to put in the effort or not capable of it, regardless of whether that was the intended message. If the goal is to try to help people, it's more effective to communicate in a way that conveys understanding and not judgment; if someone doesn't care to improve their methodology of helping people, that's fine, but it does raise more doubts about whether they're being honest about their intentions.replyzhte415 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Your post reminds me of three things -The nature of what's being learnt. Some things require a continuity - to understand B, prior A is needed (or helps, to understand faster).The method of learning. Book/theory-based, or practical? For either, what's the nature of scaffolding (self, or via resources) to help leap the chasm? If testing one's self, what's the complexity and can that complexity be broken down into simpler (or more discrete) parts, (perhaps testing working better in smaller parts)? Perhaps A isn't fully (or at all) required to 'know' B, depending on how it's learnt. Which goes on to -The nature of the learner (at that point for that task). Someone that's looking to solve a task, somewhat surface, or someone that's interested and will go deeper into edge cases or approach with greater curiosity?[I'm skipping the nature of the learning/knowledge, since 'resolving DNS' is a pretty externally verifiable result. However it might be fruitful to consider the nature of the learning is not only 'resolving DNS', and even if 'resolving DNS' fails, learning always happens (intended/unintended, positive/negative, a can of worms there).]You point out that 'easy' and 'hard' are motivators that might have unexpected, or the reverse, effects vs. intended, depending on the reader. When putting it into those 3 parts, perhaps this shows the usefulness of framing.reply13of40 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Just my 2 cents: I worked on the DNS in Windows Server back in the 200x's (validating the UI and back-end functionality, not dev work), so I did have to learn about it at one point and I recall that there was a vicious level of complexity to it compared to what we ask it to do. The 99% scenario is turning a domain into an IP via an A record. Next after that is doing the same with an MX record. Beyond that is this deep well of other things people thought someone might want to do with DNS, but that almost nobody takes advantage of in real life. So DNS is probably easy to understand if you're just concerned about the one or two first class scenarios, but if you had to implement an RFC-correct instance of a DNS server, it's a bit of a brain melter.replysyntheweave 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is the comment I wanted to make. DNS is one of those technologies that has a simple explanation - \"it's indirection\" - with consequential ramifications that turn it into someone's job. Most people will not interact with it often enough to know how to perform the job, so they remain hesitant and try not to do anything at all with it, because it burned them once before.Git is analogous - most uses of Git are formulaic, and the underlying concepts are simple enough - but actually accessing the right lever to pull when disaster strikes is unclear and hard to experiment with. I'm in this latter category with DNS: I get it at a high level, but it's like a student who has only done the simple example project.I'm of the opinion that we're at a good moment to redo the things DNS does with better separation of concerns by going towards \"put those records on a blockchain, streamline it for known applications, reframe the hard problem around bootstrapping access to on-chain data\". It's already been explored in varying degrees(e.g. Ethereum Name Service, Symbol namespaces) but it's not really something that has to be the monopoly of any specific chain.replycyberax 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] ANYTHING that has the word \"blockchain\" is automatically disqualified from pretty much any real use.In particular, pretty much nobody wants to trust DNS names that can cost hundreds of millions to blockchain. Because if you lose (or compromise) your private key, then that's it. The domain is gone.With regular DNS this would be solved by a couple of irate phone calls to registrars. At worst, via a court case.replyzx8080 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Git is analogous - most uses of Git are formulaic, and the underlying concepts are simple enough - but actually accessing the right lever to pull when disaster strikes is unclear and hard to experiment with.Would you mind sharing some examples of hard-to-recover git related disaster? I ask because I previously worked with applying hundreds of patches on top of chromium (yes, Opera). This resulted in __multiple__ merge‐conflicts. However not anything close to what I would call a git related disaster. Anything could be undone nicely.What is important is that git is very verbose by default. It guides through not only a repo current state but also options user has.I've met many developers not caring to read any of a git output and then claiming git is too complex and git broke their repo and it's \"too complex to use\". I'm sure it's not the case for you though.So I'm just curious what kind of disaster was mentioned above.replyAlotOfReading 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not OP, but I've encountered a few situations where the solution was modifying .git/ manually.

There are many other concepts this happens with and in other ways: people sing praises of the pedagogic excellence in Skiena’s & Sedgewick’s algorithm textbooks (and the awful EPI book by Aziz et al) but I hate reading them, they’re actually written horribly to explain things, IMO. I think this form of difficult writing on top of already difficult concepts is a weird type of gate keeping (perhaps sometimes unintentional?) and it should be tackled all over Computer Science by better writers who have an explanation style like yours.replysitzkrieg 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] i thought to post about how i thought \"dns looks fairly straightforward\" (which i guess it is on paper) then learned all the nuances over the years of maintaining a few services across a few domains and debugging network issues as a networking fw dev. i paused and the difference is perfectly between the the parent and grandparent post really.some things seem deceptively easy and you can get by for years on basic features. then it happens, you try something new you learned you can do with $THING , add to it and things start to break and you dig in and realize you never fundamentally understood how the basic features that got you here worked. and thats okreplyredog 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I get it.

It encourages mental weakness.At the same time, I understand that your aim is to reach as large an audience as possible so your educational material can have max impact.

Dig is powerful, but abbreviates everything like we're on an 80 column terminal. At times Wireshark was a better tool debugging DNS issues than Dig was.Give someone PowerDNS or another modern DNS server and I think they'll have a much better time configuring a working DNS server. I don't know a good modern DNS client, so I've learned to deal with Dig instead. As a user of the \"--color\" flag for the `ip` command, I'd love to see tools like dig produce more modern output (I'll alias the command line flags, just add it to the command!)Seriously, \"MSG SIZE rcvd: 71\" did not need abbreviation. \"flags: qr rd ra\" could've been full words as well. I don't know what the semicolons before the lines are supposed to convey but they're only making things confusing.I find it no wonder people get confused learning DNS with the materials provided to them.replychefandy 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'd conservatively estimate 90% of the people who make core FOSS software interface decisions haven't had to learn anything technical in an entirely unfamiliar domain where there existing mental models didn't apply in decades. Beyond that, many consider having learned these arbitrary, terse interfaces as a badge of honor, and for some reason thinks that makes them better technologists. I'll bet they'd be even better had they been able to focus on the core concepts rather than trying to get into some systems engineer's head who worked at Berkley in 1984.replydahfizz 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I disagree.The CLI is inherently a super-user oriented interface. The CLI needs to let an experienced user be as productive as possible.If you need a pretty UI with everything spelled out, you should go on GitHub and find a GUI that someone built on top of the core tool. But dumbing down the core tool is not the way to go.The --help message should be good, and the man page needs to be good, but the tool itself should favor power and productivity over handholding someone who doesn't want to Google a how-to.replytmpX7dMeXU 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is full of false dichotomy. Making things more understandable isn’t “dumbing them down”. There isn’t necessarily a trade-off. An application being CLI-based is not a get out of jail free card for UX critiques, nor is it an implication that it’s for power-users. You can’t just put the minimum viable effort into considering how someone will use your software without any thought to intuitive mental models and cry “it’s for power users”.Old-school FOSS nerds have a hard time admitting that they tend to be absolutely useless at considering user experience, because then that’s something On Computers that they’re not good at. The best they can do is shoo it away by claiming that the sort of UX concerns I’m talking about only apply to software used by Lesser Beings and not Smart Computer Boys such as themselves.It’s such an outdated user-hostile boys club attitude fuelled by insecurity and misplaced and not even well-thought-out elitism, and I’ll never pull any punches when talking about it.replyhitpointdrew 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > nor is it an implication that it’s for power-users.Yes it is. As an administrator being a CLI tool means that I can automate configs and deployment with ansible or Nix OS. I would argue doing these sorts of automation what are what “power-users” would do.GUI’s often lack any sort of automation capability or have some half-cocked API that usually lacks features or endpoints that would be trivial if the thing was just a CLI tool with a config file.replychefandy 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Good interface design absolutely does not require a gui. When I first encountered a BSD distro that used ports, that was a huge interface improvement. Then Deb or whatever beyond that.Using sane labels and coherent layouts isn't dumbing anything down. You can make things easier for humans while having sane interfaces for scripting. Redirecting the output of `ls` and similar commands automatically change the layout to something easy for cli i/o manipulation.We realized long long ago that the API and human-facing interfaces are often better when separated, which is why I don't browse the web with curl... or maybe telnet.replysdf4j 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I disagree.I'm a super-user and as such I have to use hundreds of tools to GTD.

I try to write documentation that is as clear as it is concise and well structured. But sometimes that’s just not realistically possible, and expressing information often _has_ to assume some level of familiarity with the underlying concepts.I’ve never considered DNS to be a complicated technology, and I’ve never considered that tools like dig and the abbreviations they use need to change much. If there’s something that isn’t clear, it’ll be in the man page, a mailing list, Internet based documentation, StackOverflow, etc.Personally, I value information density, and I don’t mind terseness at all.That doesn’t necessarily mean I would design some of this stuff the same way, but after more than a decade using it, I feel like changing it now is just an appeal to futility. A tool like dig more or less looks and works the same today as it did 15 years ago, and there’s value in that kind of stability.replychefandy 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > but after more than a decade using it, I feel like changing it now is just an appeal to futilityAnd that's why your learning to use these tools a decade ago was as painful as it was for me 20+ years ago, and so on. Nobody improves it because the only people with the clout to make the changes is too set in their ways to change it, and have come to believe the ridiculous notion that it's beneficial for people to learn it, despite not being related to the actual problem.I worked in technical roles for the better part of 25 years, including 10 as a back end developer. One of the reasons I got into design was to try and break chains like this, but talking to the FOSS community about design gets nearly zero traction and a whole lot of pushback from folks who think they know a lot more about design than they do. Nothing you do matches the information density of a train schedule in a large city, and those designs are so ubiquitous and intuitive that we take them for granted. That was not always the case— someone decided to lay things out like that at some point because they knew it works be easier and more intuitive for the majority even if it might take some adjustment for existing everyday users. And designers still work to make them better, to this day.I wrote a tutorial teaching non-technical folks to use a rest API. It required no knowledge beyond familiarity with using web browsers, and ended with people making useful queries with curl. It was short, visual, and effective- I learned that multiple non-profits at the time used it in their materials to teach folks technical literacy. Just because using a bunch of terse jargon is easier for developers to write and acceptable for other developers to read doesn't mean it's optimal... Or even good.

In my experience, online tutorials for setting them up come tantalizingly close to giving me what I need, but I often end up getting stuck with the last few details (usually the weird punctuation required) because, again, I touch this stuff so infrequently I just don't remember from one time to the next.

One of the things that I found out and became more curious about was why DNS was so critical for Active Directory, upon where I discovered the magic of SRV records. After that I decided I wanted to learn DNS in detail, so I read the RFCs, poked around with nslookup and dig, and then set up a local copy of BIND on a Linux VM to experiment with. In the numerous intervening years I've picked up more over time and been involved in numerous situations where I had to assist someone by doing DNS spelunking, often learning something in the process. I jumped from being a help desk monkey to being an L2 sysadmin in my very next job largely on the basis of my DNS and Active Directory knowledge, all of which was learned by reading documentation and poking at things, nothing particularly difficult about either.What always causes challenges is weird edge cases, but if you understand how things are supposed to work at a protocol level you have the basis of knowledge to troubleshoot the edge cases, which is how you learn about the more esoteric or implementation specific behaviors of things. I wouldn't expect anyone to particularly have deep knowledge of AD or DNS edge cases, but the basics of how they work aren't particularly hard knowledge to acquire and it's a constant surprise to me how few tech people understand DNS in particular, since it's a critical system for nearly every aspect of modern computing.As far as resources, when learning these things way back when I only used the official Microsoft documentation, the RFCs, man pages, and sites like nixCraft to learn about it. These same resources still exist (although Google sucks now and makes anything decent hard to find), and these protocols have changed very little in the intervening nearly 20 years, so I don't think it's any harder for folks to learn today than it was for me back then. This stuff is very literally not rocket science, DNS is an extremely basic protocol. In fact, nearly all its weird edge cases is because it's such a basic protocol that some behavior isn't clearly defined, however /most/ behavior is. It's very nearly all text on the wire, and all of the zone records, queries, and responses are human readable. As someone else mentioned, you can just use Wireshark and learn about DNS. It's inspectable on the wire, not just through tooling.FWIW, Active Directory is far more difficult to learn in detail than DNS, largely because Kerberos is deeply complex, and Active Directory has many unique complexities (like how FSMO roles work). DNS in comparison to most other things you are expected to know as even a semi-competent systems administrators / SRE is mindbogglingly simple.replyWarOnPrivacy 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Setup an in-house server to sinkhole malware requests.replyoneplane 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] I think the article hits the nail on the head. DNS itself isn't hard, but learning real-world DNS is, due to the (as described) hidden nature of many parts between intending to do a lookup and getting the expected result.Some of this also stems from the divergence of what used to be a 'default' way to be connected to the internet (one interface, one gateway, one DNS server provider) and what is now far more common like having to figure out how to actually do the lookup in the first place (connected to multiple WANs, sometimes concurrently like LTE and WiFi) and as a user, not actually being able to tell which resolving path was used (was it the browser? the standard interface in the system C lib? was it some local resolver or recursor that sits in between the lookup? do any of them have a local cache? do any of them add special options by default?).Even if everything works, you'd still not be able to blindly trust if the query and response used the same path in one application as it did in another. Three browsers might all use something different, and the OS itself might use something different yet again, only to have mDNS add a fifth option.replythunderbong 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] Because the only three hard problems in computer science are cache invalidation and naming things.And DNS is a caching system for names of things.https://reddit.com/comments/15c2ul2/comment/jtty9dyreplyyard2010 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] Also, off by one errors, which is impliedreplypphysch 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] To be fair, DNS is one of the best examples of \"naming things done right\".It's globally-curated (IANA), hierarchical, federated, easy to modify.replyjl6 14 hours ago | prev | next [–] It's one of those things where there is a mismatch between how easy it seems to be, and how hard it turns out to be.We all use DNS every day, and it seems really easy. The everyday language of DNS is: domain names, lookups, IP addresses. This language is exposed in browsers for all to see, and through this exposure we develop a mental model of how we think it works.But under the covers there is a whole new language: zones, resolvers, delegated authority, that weird dot after the top-level domain...replygerdesj 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] \"that weird dot after the top-level domain\"That weird dot is called root. Without it, a name is unqualified, with it the name is completely defined. That means that context is everything. Without the dot, a resolver might add the resolver's domain or parts of it, repeatedly.Now, you and I know exactly what: host.example.co.uk is supposed to mean but without the trailing dot a resolver could try to look up host.example.co.uk.example.co.ukWindows out of the box, if this happened would also try host.example.co.uk.example.co then host.example.co.uk.example and then host.example.co.uk.example, then host.example.co.uk. and get a result. However I never saw Windows actually try the first effort and I think the behaviour was designed to deal with large corp with DNS federated monstrosity Active Directories.Your browser is probably toddling off to a DNS over https (DoH) server these days without your say so and canoodling with all sorts of ne'er do wells. Your DNS lookups are basic data - your ISP used to love seeing where you go. Your OS vendor (if you buy your OS) obviously can pass back \"telemetry\". Mr Google, doesn't own the desktop but does own the browser, so by ensuring you use \"safe\" DNS servers for your browser instead of whatever you have configured, its all good. All these shenanigans does make IT troubleshooting far more exciting than it used to be.I shouldn't worry too much about trailing dots. You will almost certainly not be using the DNS servers you think you are. I get why DOH was invented and there is a good reason for some \"civilians\" to use it - ie a non IT specialist using a nasty wifi hotspot will be protected from some harm by their browser going home securely to do DNS lookups. However is it up to the browser vendor to trample all over the user's choice of Endpoint Security?DNS is way more complicated than simply looking up addresses. Its about money these days (actually it always has been since around 2000) and there are now a lot of very opinionated mega corps who want to decide who profits off you.replybriHass 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You might actually be surprised, or at least I was, that browsers -- and typically worse, IoT junk, still generally respect the DNS server(s) served to them via DHCP or they use plain ol' 53 to the hardcoded Google/Cloudflare standards. Some (like the Facebook Portal) are tricky enough to try DNS over TLS, but insofar as my big-list-of-common-DNS-IPs in the block rule is accurate, nothing reaches out over DoH unless explicitly configured to do so.Like you, however, I see the writing on the wall. Being able to easily see (and block) how these devices/operating systems/apps relentlessly and obsessively phone home to upload as much telemetry as they can get their hands on is not something these corporations want. Eventually, they will all just use your connection for the bandwidth and pass everything over a VPN to hardcoded endpoints.replydclowd9901 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It’s the distribution part that makes it hard right?

I knew about `dig(1)` and BIND and a CS101 idea of how recursive DNS resolution works, etc. But I was missing the working knowledge needed for designing and implementing anything non-trivial or for debugging non-working systems. So I read \"DNS and BIND\" (not quite cover-to-cover, but close, skipping over the details on some of the more exotic features). I set up a real BIND server for some unimportant personal web sites. None of it was hard, but it did involve a bunch of (time) investment. To be clear, BIND is not the right thing for many use cases, but a lot of DNS ideas and terminology still come from BIND and I found that stuff very valuable.I think books are underappreciated for learning stuff like this. Most resources you find on the web are high-level theory (\"here's a block diagram of how recursive lookup works\"), task-oriented (\"how do I get `dig` to do a recursive lookup\"), or otherwise low-level (e.g., reading the source of your local DNS client to understand its retry policy). To understand the pieces and how they fit together, from the theory (what they're trying to achieve) down to implementation (what caches exist where), I find there's no substitute for a holistic approach that you usually find in books, but rarely (not never) find on the web.replygunapologist99 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] It's probably a good idea for all IT people to have a working knowledge of how to debug DNS issues.DNS has historically been a vector for significant security holes and it's likely that this will continue to be true for the indefinite future. These holes also lead to other vectors in nearly every other protocol like SMTP. Even the CA system used for HTTPS is highly dependent on a basically insecure protocol. (Would you notice if your bank bought a DV certificate instead of OV? likely not)So, perhaps it's not such a bad thing that it seems hard to learn to those who don't have enough interest, since even now we see people building DNS things without taking the time to really understand the history of things like port randomization, cache poisoning, AXFR, etc.replydgb23 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] It seems to me that everything which broadcasts/asserts routing decisions in a network (any layer) is deceptively simple and potentially dangerous.replychasd00 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > deceptively simple and potentially dangerousAlso, there's not a lot of people keeping the whole thing running. iirc there's only like 13 or 14 root DNS servers on earth.replygloria_mundi 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There are 13 root name server addresses, but most (all?) of these use anycast, i.e. there are actually several servers with the same address, and your traffic will usually be routed to the one closest to you.

Instead of setting the WRT54G's DHCP server to hand out the domain controller's static IP as the DNS server for proper name resolution I just used IP addresses and host file entries to make everything work. I also had the MX record for the domain set to the router's WAN IP and didn't have any PTR records set - the fact that e-mail delivery went as smoothly as it did is an absolute miracle in retrospect. A few years later I figured out how DNS actually worked and in my early 20s I inherited a corporate intranet where BIND was used as the nameserver for all external corporate domain zones. Moving this setup to VPSes for increased reliability taught me a _lot_ (mostly zone transfers, SOA, etc). I'm grateful for the experience but these days everything is pretty much done for you so this is a low-value activity... \"IT\" isn't valued the same way that \"software engineering\" is for better or worse.replyTheNewsIsHere 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is why I continue to maintain that ops and SE excel at remaining distinct fields, though I certainly don’t mind overlap.Most of my friends are software developers and/or software developers working on cloud-based stacks.Two of those friends lead the platform engineering groups at their respective companies. One of them has a very basic understanding of networking and could figure out how to do subnetting that didn’t come out of the box, but they’d need to stop and go learn that.That isn’t everyone by any stretch, but I see it more often than not these days.I agree fully with the idea that younger professionals aren’t as used to the infrastructure underneath the infrastructure being as complex as the higher layers of the OSI model that they’re frequently more experienced with.What I hope we don’t end up with is a future where all the data center people and all the network engineers (and so on) are almost exclusively employed by a small number of mega-corps.

Pretty obvious, but when someone asks the reasonable question \"can you open a firewall hole for thing.behind.cdn.it\"Some servers forward requests, some delegate, some will look stuff up for you others won't. And there's the magic with search domains on clients, and if clients or internal resolver libraries will honor TTLs or not.There's also the myriad different types of records, and sometimes the server will tell you to reconnect in TCP instead of UDP, etc.So -- DNS is pretty complex; it has the illusion of being simple because it works so well and most of the fiddly bits are abstracted away by stuff that mostly just works.replyhiAndrewQuinn 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Re/ knowing older protocols, I recently took a few weeks to read _Networking for System Administrators_ and take+review copious Anki card notes.

Glue records are really just A records with clout, returned with the IP of your name server. This glue is maintained by the higher level authoritative zone. So you query for example.org and the nameserver for .org returns ns1.example.org as the name server for your zone, as well as the IP address for that server.This is why you could run a DNS server at ns1.example.org as your authoritative DNS.replyharoldp 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Pretty good! :)Besides what was mentioned by others, there are two more mistakes in the SOA and one in each NS.replythrow0101b 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > mistakes in the SOAI figured there was since (e.g.) the numbers looked 'off' (regular TTL vs. negative TTL), but couldn't be arsed to look up the exact SOA format.replysomat 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Also the CNAME if you have a cname you don't want any other records with the same name.

Unsavory jokes in mailing list/code bases, etc. However, we've come upon a bunch of people who take the aggressively negative view on the words and interactions used and have taken it upon themselves to rename things and force changes. (Master/main, master/slave, whitelist/blacklist, [theres a whole list of these \"undesirable\" language things] etc ).On top of that the CoC has implemented toxic positivity rules on projects. Implementers overlook the fact that they have been used as a weapon to be put in the project it's self.

I still spent most of my time in front of it playing games, of course, but I also learned to program a little bit, and by the time we had our first PC at home, I also learned troubleshooting because every time I broke it I had to get it working before one of my parents needed it.Other than that, I think school prepared me well in terms of foundations (perhaps better than what some kids see today, at least I'm surprised how few people who went through formal CS/SWE university training recently know enough about the reasons the relational model was introduced, or how operating systems work).On the other hand, practical skills taught at school were not immediately useful to me. In particular, the software stack most used at school (Pascal, then Delphi, we did have some courses using C, Prolog, ASM, COBOL, and SQL, but most of my programming hours in school were spent in Pascal/Delphi) was not used in any of the jobs I've had, with the exception of COBOL), so I did a lot of learning on the job.I make a living working on databases now, and I sometimes like to tell the story of how I got into them: while working at a bank, the web banking application had an SQL Server backend database for its frontend (actual banking happened in another network, on a mainframe, I don't know which DB it used but it was some IBM thing and it was not DB/2). There was a settings table that was basically a key/value store controlling different config options of the app. One of them was a maintenance flag which, if set to whatever the value for true was, would show a \"we're under maintenance\" page when serving any user request. One day they asked me to go put the site on maintenance (\"go put the site\" because I had to go walk upstairs and enter the datacenter to do this back then), so I went to the console, opened the query editor, and entered something like:update settings set value = 1;Notice the lack of a where clause. When I saw the number of rows affected, I panicked, ran downstairs, explained what I had done, and a colleague (who was also young but I think at his second job after school, and way more experienced than me) calmed me down, walked up with me again, showed me where the backups where, and helped me restore one.I've been hooked on databases since that day!replyxtagon 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The downside to things that \"just work\" is that they become magical black boxes where learning how they work isn't a requirement until things really go wrong.replydv_dt 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] DNS concepts are pretty straightforward, but I agree with the article that there are a lot of little holes to fall into.

Really if anything, stuff has regressed since then.Our setup in the early 2000s was the same as today, except the AP, router, and modem were separate devices.

Most people will only ever need to modify A/CNAME, occasional MX and TXT, and maybe an SOA/PTR.Even the more arcane record types (as far as I've ever used them) are essentially key-value pairs with the record type analogous to a namespace.replypaulddraper 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] AAAAAlso NS is reasonably common.replynaniwaduni 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, that's the dropdown.replymsie 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Exactly.

Best to have some knowledge of systems like that so you can design them.replychaps 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] One of the best, but also strangest explanation of DNS I've seen is from \"A Cat Explains DNS\". It's wonderful.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZtFk2dtqv0reply1vuio0pswjnm7 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'm not a \"developer\" and I learned DNS without any problems. Therefore agree with other commenter that DNS is not actually difficult to learn. I like the output from DNS utilities such as BIND and tinydns format.DNS is worth learning for any internet user, IMHO. I've written primitive utilities that when used together can do stuff none of the popular DNS utilities can do. I use these every day.Here's DNS challenge for readers. Try to look up the domain \"bootable.com\". Use whatever is the preferred method.People writing about DNS often compare it to a telephone book. IMO the way most people use DNS is more like \"directory assistance\".IP addresses do change but by and large most stay the same for long periods. Old zone files, publicly available scans^1 and other bulk DNS data collected from web crawls and public DNS caches comprise the \"phone book\" for me. Absolutely essential.1. Sadly, in recent some of these sources have changed to non-public. No phone book for you! Call directory assistance.replyrconti 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] > DNS is not actually difficult to learn.> tinydns format.You earned my disagreement right there!replymkeedlinger 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I found out about https://www.nslookup.io/learning/ recently, which greatly increased my knowledge of DNS.

The game mechanics are straightforward, and it gets more complex from there.DNS bears the burden of delivering you to complex IT systems. It’s abused in various ways to enforce geographic restrictions, service levels, etc. It generally works, so long as everyone upstream knows how to configure things so that downstream things they don’t know exist work well.When things don’t work… that’s not easy.replymike31fr 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] DNS-noob here: For what use case is it useful to debug DNS like described in this article?

You'd start the client, go \"/world ZebraMUCK\" and then the TUI would hang while the DNS name resolved.So then we figured out asynchronous DNS (this was in the days when you linked with \"-lresolv\" on SunOS) and it was like a breath of fresh air! You could go \"/world ZebraMUCK\", control was returned to the keyboard, and even if it took 120 seconds to resolve zebramuck.nozebra.example.com, you could go about your business, like in another world, or issue some other client commands.And client developers learned a little about select(3).replylanstin 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] with the caching, it's a nice bimodal distribution, 99.99$ 0 ms response time, 0.01% 30 ms response time (with a small chance of having that query packet be dropped, with retries in the 1000s of ms). I've seen people write caches that use the old value and kick off a new query in the background to hopefully populate the cache again.replyertian 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] 'Still'? There's a famous talk[1] in the network community about how DNS complexity is growing so fast that effectively nobody can keep up with it. There's so many competing, overlapping, and overriding RFCs that it's hard to make sense of it anymore.[1] https://blog.apnic.net/2018/03/29/the-dns-camel/replyneilv 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] At one point, I had to make and maintain my own DNS zone text file, knowing only a little. Today, cheap providers give me various Web forms interfaces, but that doesn't mean it will always \"just work\", so knowing a little can still help.I still had to break out `dig` the other day, when a DNS provider started answering records days past TTL, breaking email and Web.To know when if/when that happened again, I looked around for a monitoring service, but didn't quickly find one that did what I wanted (and was overwhelmed by SEO, and very aggressive robo-sales emails from one of them), so I wrote a script that essentially runs `dig` and `diff`: https://www.neilvandyke.org/check-my-dns/The monitoring script discovered one of a provider's DNS servers had ongoing problems, so I sent them a monitoring report, saying I wasn't a DNS expert, but perhaps, if there's a problem, the report would be helpful to their DNS experts. This seemed to immediately get past any \"have you tried rebooting Windows\" front-line flowchart response that I wouldn't have been surprised to hear, and they said they're working on it.replymqus 12 hours ago | prev | next [–] For me, the issue isn't so much DNS itself, but more that there are more things that try to resolve names on your PC, like /etc/hosts and all the stuff you put into resolv.conf.Then you read online that you should try dig or so and those tools don't really match up with what your tools do(=resolving via libc), because dig really only does the DNS part.replylaserbeam 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] Here's what's cool about the article:- Presents some nice theories which make things hard to learn (infrequent use, poor tools...)- Describes how DNS tools could be improved.- Gives you a few gotchas for how one may shoot themselves in a foot with DNS.Here's what's a bit (not much) less cool:- I really have no clue if those things ACTUALLY make things hard to learn (because it's not a research paper on learning).- It's a plug for other content on the side which actually describes the DNS protocol.

The article points some of that out (stub resolvers, even different implementations of libc); recursive versus authoritative responses; the recursion process; recursive versus authoritative servers.A lot of deployment implementations are \"bottom of the barrel\" and aren't correct to begin with, although they work for the intended purpose. There is no checklist for server implementations which I am aware of (I've asked where people should know!). There's a lot of folklore which persists because if it works it's presumed correct.There's \"DNS\" and then there's \"The DNS\", the \"one true root\" with arbitrary restrictions on the contents of labels. There's political interference with implementations in terms of the \"one true root\" doctrine, which interferes with marrying a resolver which e.g. queries a control plane and serves an application plane (where they have different roots): there are e.g. notions of forwarded zones, but there is no notion I am aware of of a \"always recurse and lie that you're authoritative\" zone (you can hack source code to accomplish this of course).Even MITRE ATT&CK doesn't always get it right. They had it listed that DNSSEC \"traffic\" had to be examined with SSL tools, until I pointed it out (I didn't get credit). DNSSEC related records are ordinary DNS records, nothing is being encrypted.I could go on: the experts were wrong on (UDP) frags, anycast...replymagicmicah85 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] \"(like, what if you could run dig +debug google.com and it gave you a bunch of extra debugging information?)\"The flag they're looking for is +trace and it provides exactly what they're looking for which is a path of how resolution occurs from root nameservers all the way down to the domain.replyroomey 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] There's an old saying: if someone tell's you they know how DNS works, they're lyingreplyrsync 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] The question I have is:Why isn't there a combined MTA/DKIM/DNS server ?Why am I installing and configuring and running and monitoring all of these different server software packages ?I'd like to have a single config file that handles everything required to run a mailserver.If I have more complex needs I can split things up make them modular ... but I don't.replyquesera 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] > Why isn't there a combined MTA/DKIM/DNS server ?If the nameserver was part of the MTA, where would you configure a CNAME for your webserver?> I'd like to have a single config file that handles everything required to run a mailserver.I think the kids call that Ansible. :)replyandrewfromx 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] sometimes it's hard to even know WHERE to change the settings.

It is likely an extension that is meant to provide a more human-readable output, making it easier for people to understand the results.+norecurse: This flag tells the DNS server (in this case, the server at IP address 8.8.8.8, which is a public Google DNS server) not to perform recursive lookups. Recursive lookups involve the DNS server querying other DNS servers if it doesn't have the requested information in its cache. By using +norecurse, the server will only provide information if it has it directly available.@8.8.8.8: This indicates the DNS server being queried, which is the Google Public DNS server located at IP address 8.8.8.8.google.com: This is the domain name being queried.Now, let's look at the different sections of the response:HEADER: This section provides general information about the response. opcode: QUERY: Indicates that the query type is a standard query. status: NOERROR: Indicates that the query was successful, and there were no errors. id: 11653: This is a unique identifier for the query, used to match queries with their respective responses. flags: qr ra: The flags indicate that this is a response (qr) and that recursion is available and allowed (ra). QUESTION SECTION: This section shows the domain name and the type of record being queried. google.com. IN A: The domain name \"google.com\" is being queried for its IPv4 address (A record). ANSWER SECTION: This section provides the answer to the query. google.com. 21 IN A 172.217.4.206: This line shows the answer. It says that the IPv4 address of \"google.com\" is 172.217.4.206. The \"21\" is the time to live (TTL) value in seconds, which indicates how long the information can be cached by other DNS servers or clients before it should be refreshed. ADDITIONAL SECTION: This section provides additional information related to the query. EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512: This line indicates the use of EDNS (Extension Mechanisms for DNS), which is a set of extensions to the DNS protocol. The version is 0, and the flags are empty. \"udp: 512\" refers to the maximum payload size that can be used for UDP communication. In summary, the query asked for the IPv4 address (A record) of \"google.com\" from the Google Public DNS server at IP address 8.8.8.8. The response confirms that the IPv4 address is 172.217.4.206, and it is valid for 21 seconds.replyreadonthegoapp 6 hours ago | prev [–] i had hella trouble with it, but not just it - all the related topics - reverse dns/proxy setups, 10 ways to configure it/them, cname flattening and the 15 ways to configure that, the 15 ways you can do it with cloudflare or not, dis/advantages of all those setups/combinations/permutations, etc.doubt a course could teach me half of what i would need to know in some reasonable amount of time - say, two or three months.but open to the idea.reply",

Google's latest maneuver, if we don't act to stop it, threatens our freedom to explore the Internet with browsers of our choice.Editorial note: For greater visibility, this article has been published here, on fsf.org. You can also find it on defectivebydesign.org, which also has other DRM-related articles and materials.Using a free browser is now more important than ever. We've written recently on this topic, but the issue we wrote about there was minor compared to the gross injustice Google is now attempting to force down the throats of web users around the world. The so-called \"Web Environment Integrity\" (WEI) is the worst stunt we've seen from them in some time. Beginning its life as an innocuous, if worrying, policy document posted to Microsoft GitHub, Google has now fast-tracked its development into their Chromium browser. At its current rate of progress, WEI will be upon us in no time.By giving developers an API through which they can approve certain browser configurations while forbidding others, WEI is a tremendous step toward the \"enshittification\" of the web as a whole. Many of us have grown up with a specific idea of the Internet, the notion of it as a collection of hyperlinked pages that can be accessed by a wide variety of different machines, programs, and operating systems. WEI is this idea's antithesis.Compared to its staggering potential effects, the technical means through which WEI will accomplish its ends is relatively simple. Before serving a web page, a server can ask a third-party \"verification\" service to make sure that the user's browsing environment has not been \"tampered\" with. A translation of the policy's terminology will help us here: this Google-owned server will be asked to make sure that the browser does not deviate in any way from Google's accepted browser configuration, precluding any meaningful use of the four freedoms. It is not far-fetched to imagine a future in which sites simply refuse to serve pages to users running free browsers or free operating systems. If WEI isn't stopped now, that future will come sooner than we think.While Web Environment Integrity has a policy document that attempts to explain valid ways in which it could be used, these are all non-issues compared to the way that we know it will be used. It will be used by governments to ensure that only their officially \"approved\" (read: backdoored) browsers are able to access the Internet; it will be used by corporations like Netflix to further Digital Restrictions Management (DRM); it will be used by Google to deny access to their services unless you are using a browser that gels with their profit margin.Once upon a time, Google's official policy was \"don't be evil.\" With the rapid progress they've made on Web Environment Integrity in such a short time, we can say very safely that their policy is now to pioneer evil. As we write this, talented and well-paid Google engineers and executives are working to dismantle what makes the web the web. Given that Google is one of the largest corporations on the planet, our only hope of saving the Internet as we know it is a clear and principled stance for freedom, a collective upholding of the communal principles on which the web was based.Let us repeat: there is absolutely no legitimate justification for WEI. The use cases that the policy document highlights are nothing compared to its real use case, which is developing a method to obtain complete and total restriction of the free Internet.We urge everyone involved in a decision-making capacity at Google to consider the principles on which the web was founded, and to carefully contemplate whether Web Environment Integrity aligns with those principles. We hope that they will realize WEI's fundamental incompatibility with the free Internet and cease work on the standard immediately.And if they don't? Well, they ought to be ashamed.Document Actions Share on social networks Syndicate: News Events Blogs Jobs GNUTake ActionLet the representatives of your government know that end-to-end encryption is vital, and share your message on social media to inspire others.FSF community blog Licensing Compliance Lab blog Associate Membership blog System Administrator's blog Free Software Directory blog GNU Press blog Sign upEnter your email address to receive our monthly newsletter, the Free Software SupporterNewsThe next round of FSF board candidate discussions will start on July 24 Jul 20, 2023The FSF board candidate discussions will start on May 29 May 16, 2023Announcing the FSF's board candidates May 02, 2023 More news…Recent blogs \"Web Environment Integrity\" is an all-out attack on the free Internet From pro-democracy activists to minorities: Why people use Tor and encrypted chats Working together for free software: Meet Ali \"Miracle\" Abdulghani Working together for free software: Our interview with Protesilaos Stavrou Recent blogs - More…Upcoming EventsFree Software Directory meeting on IRC: Friday, August 04, starting at 12:00 EDT (16:00 UTC) Aug 04, 2023 12:00 PM - 03:00 PM — #fsf on libera.chat Previous events… Upcoming events…  The FSF is a charity with a worldwide mission to advance software freedom — learn about our history and work.Copyright © 2004-2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Sure, corporations are going to corporate away, so what are the options for us, users, and future users, who currently do not care, but might find current iteration of internet useful? I don't mind Google shutting all their products behind some wall, that requires using custom unmodifiable browser to access them, but do not spread it all over the place.

At one point some users were inserting purposefully wrong answers or slurs into the unknown word to mess with the data collection.I expect the idea is the same with images, if there are 4 buses I expect 2 it knows are correct and used as a sanity test, 1 it's pretty sure it's correct (from majority of users selecting it), and 1 has some heuristics that might be a bus but it is currently testing to see whether users believe is or not. Similarly with the 5 not a bus images.replynashashmi 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It doesn’t know the answers are correct. I intentionally give it the wrong answers.

Seems like better marketing does wonders, as I haven't seen any discussion of this.https://blog.cloudflare.com/eliminating-captchas-on-iphones-...Some interesting bits:> [...] We don’t actually need or want the underlying data that’s being collected for this process, we just want to verify if a visitor is faking their device or user agent.

But as Google themselves note in their explainer¹, they're quite different, and Google considers PAT insufficient for the kind of enforcement they intend to do.For example, PAT is ultimately just \"not a bot\" attestation and so doesn't involve the exchange of device and browser environment data. In contrast, WEI needs that data to enable the kind of \"DRM for the web\" use cases we're reading about.https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/...replynull0pointer 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > we just want to verify if a visitor is faking their device or user agentWhat does it mean to fake a device or user agent? Their intent is probably devices and user agents who say they’re one thing but are actually another. But browsers have been lying about who they are for decades. And what’s the difference between a fake device/UA and an unusual device/UA? Probably none, as far as they’re concerned.replyuzername 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I read about this last year in the original Cloudflare post. Cloudflare is a darling but I thought this one was dangerous for the web too.replywmf 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think the difference is that PAT allows ad blockers but WEI won't.replyschoen 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Does the PAT implementation still require that the page content is being rendered live to a human user, or not exported or something?(I know web APIs can't directly prevent those things, but they might be able to let a site determine whether a user is doing something to prevent CSS or Javascript tricks from preventing them.)replygigel82 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] PAT and WEI can allow and disallow whatever the hell they want, there's nothing preventing WEI from allowing ad blockers just like there's nothing preventing PATs from disallowing them.

Same reason it does not matter to my zoomer brother its contemporaneous TikTokers.People DO-NOT-GIVE-A-SHIT. Because there are bigger problems, like \"what the fuck am I going to pay the rent with tomorrow\", and more entertaining spectacles, like watching a person pretend it's an NPC for 5 hours straight and give them money for it.And I feel a lot of the people I have worked with are the same type of individual, used to realizing they are getting screwed sideways, addicted to complaining, but only as long as it's among a very select group of individuals sharing common interests.It's the most draining type of revolution.

Keep that up and push for other companies to reject it or for regulation to stop it.You know what Google fears most? Being broken down.

Why not? Those companies had real power. How did they lose?> This is a \"why didn't the slaves all get together and end slavery\" type argument.Your argument is what, that no one should make any attempt to end slavery because the slavers have too much power?No, you keep fighting until you win. Be creative, coordinate with like-minded people. This is not a community of powerless victims. There are people who hate this who have money and skill in surplus. It's not illegal to do something which is net negative for you but net positive for society purely out of altruism, or anger, because it's your life and you get to choose what you do.Reallocate the time you spend advocating defeatism to building something which is a threat to the people attacking you.replylapcat 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I'm actually heartened by the amount of public debate and pushback there has been already. Remember that this issue only came to the forefront about a week ago. You can't expect just to win overnight.People do care, but there are steps to creating public pressure.

If the new standard is dns blockers for everyone that’s an improvement in the landscape, at a small cost to the users.There is little adoption or support of privacy tools when there is no need for it and we trust our systems to be free and open, everyone is a tinfoil hat wearer until they aren’t and the boundaries have shifted.

No big deal.replyfailbuffer 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] Presumably the end game is for Google and a few other corporations to control what web browsers you can use to access most of the web. Mozilla may or may not play asking (they did on EME). Linux won't work except maybe for Ubuntu and Red Hat build if/once they get around to adding support for it. That could be a long time since you need a long chain of verifications to pass thru the browser, OS, kernel, boot environment, and TPM to work AND you'll need to convince Google that the chain is strong enough to not be hacked. Ad blockers will be shut out at some point.And no, you can't just go back to playing flight simulator off of floppies. Your bank, your airplane and concert tickets, heck even your child's pediatrician will require it. Not that doctors are hungrily reading up new web specifications, but they'll be using a medical services platform that relies on some cloudflare defaults that all the security guys like because it cuts down on bots and DDoS.You'll be left using walled garden operating systems that spy and advertise as incessantly as cable TV.Maybe a big stink will cause Google to backtrack a little, or make promises they won't and can't ultimately keep. The only real solution is to use the government to prevent users from losing control.replywilsonnb3 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Linux won't work except maybe for Ubuntu and Red Hat build if/once they get around to adding support for itThey could have stopped Linux support from Chrome at any time, or not created it to begin with.

There are still some details to work out, though.We want to be very careful with backward compatibility. We do not want another Python 3 situation, so any changes in third-party code needed to accommodate no-GIL builds should just work in with-GIL builds (although backward compatibility with older Python versions will still need to be addressed). This is not Python 4. We are still considering the requirements we want to place on ABI compatibility and other details for the two builds and the effect on backward compatibility.

No-GIL mode coming for PythonPosted Jul 28, 2023 23:51 UTC (Fri) by tialaramex (subscriber, #21167) [Link]Just over six months ago I wrote this: https://lwn.net/Articles/919666/ \"this PEP needs to specify a mechanism which ensures if you have a 2022 C library which was fine because of the GIL, and a 2022 Python program which used that C library, you cannot set everything on fire by trying to use these with a nonGIL Python. Even if you recompile the C library, even if you do some basic tinkering (adding/ removing -D parameters, fussing with file locations, that sort of thing)\" I still don't see the clarity I'd want that they understand this. They've said they don't want another Python 3, but that's acknowledging that the bad outcome was bad - it crucially is *not* a refusal to do the same thing which had that consequence. I consider this a red flag, because it communicates that they know they were expected to learn something, but they didn't and they're hoping for approval anyway.

I think that is an uncharitable read of their statement, because it immediately follows through with this: > ...so any changes in third-party code needed to accommodate no-GIL builds should just work in with-GIL builds (although backward compatibility with older Python versions will still need to be addressed). This was a major problem with Python 3 (i.e. code written for 3 was incompatible with 2), which they are explicitly refusing to repeat. They have learned their lesson from the 3.x fiasco, and are applying that lesson to this PEP. Perhaps this is not the lesson you, personally, wanted them to learn from the 3.x fiasco, but it is disingenuous to claim that they have learned nothing. More directly relevant to your comment, from the PEP: > CPython builds without the GIL will not be ABI compatible with the standard CPython build or with the stable ABI due to changes to the Python object header needed to support biased reference counting. C-API extensions will need to be rebuilt specifically for this version. The exact thing that you are asking for (GIL-less Python fails loudly if you try to load a GIL-assuming module) is already being done - the module is ABI incompatible with the new CPython, so it will fail to load. The only other question is whether they will introduce a clear error message for that situation, and it is totally unreasonable to expect a PEP to specify such fiddly details. Also of note: > This PEP poses new challenges for distributing Python. At least for some time, there will be two versions of Python requiring separately compiled C-API extensions. It may take some time for C-API extension authors to build --disable-gil compatible packages and upload them to PyPI. Additionally, some authors may be hesitant to support the --disable-gil mode until it has wide adoption, but adoption will likely depend on the availability of Python’s rich set of extensions. > > To mitigate this, the author will work with Anaconda to distribute a --disable-gil version of Python together with compatible packages from conda channels. This centralizes the challenges of building extensions, and the author believes this will enable more people to use Python without the GIL sooner than they would otherwise be able to. So the only people who will be using this in the short term are Conda users, and they have a whole package manager which is specifically responsible for detecting and dealing with this sort of compatibility problem. I doubt they even *need* a clear error message from CPython. Conda will (should) refuse to create such an invalid installation in the first place.

Side note: Your comment also mentions the end user recompiling the module, possibly with -D flags etc., but that is wildly unreasonable. C is an unsafe language. Any time you fool around with a C compiler, without actually understanding what you are doing, you are assuming the risk of shooting yourself in the foot. If the user can figure out what flags they have to pass, they can also find and write or rewrite any hypothetical \"I'm compatible with GIL-less Python\" API calls that may need to exist, so this is simply impossible unless you completely deprecate the old API and start over from scratch (which might be worth doing anyway, see HPy, but that's a separate discussion). No-GIL mode coming for PythonPosted Jul 29, 2023 5:52 UTC (Sat) by whoami (guest, #166229) [Link]C isn't inherently an unsafe language. Remember to use a condom when \"fooling around with a C compiler\". No-GIL mode coming for PythonPosted Jul 29, 2023 2:03 UTC (Sat) by Subsentient (subscriber, #142918) [Link]Truly, the end of the world is nigh -- CPython abandoning the GIL. It would be terrific to use a GIL-less Python, but since it's an omen of the end times, I assume we'll all be dead before we can finish benchmarking the improvement. Jokes aside, I've wanted this for many, many years. I don't care if C extensions require a little fiddling to update them for the GIL-less version. It's worth it. Threading on Python right now is just async with internal pthread handles unless you're calling into C and explicitly release the GIL. As someone who extensively, and I mean extensively, uses multithreading in my codebases, this will open up beautiful new possibilities for me. While they're at it, they should make an entirely new, easier, simpler C API that has consistency in the ownership of objects -- with the old API still there and supported, of couse. I shouldn't constantly have to check the C API reference to know if I need to decrement the reference count of a Python object or not. No-GIL mode coming for PythonPosted Jul 29, 2023 7:18 UTC (Sat) by atnot (subscriber, #124910) [Link]As big of an achievement this is, I'm still personally kind of disappointed they went this specfic route. Even though they say that they don't want to create another python2/3 split, the fact of the matter is still that little existing Python or C code has been written with this sort of concurrency in mind, and more importantly neither the ecosystem nor the languages have any features that make getting concurrency right easy. The amount of intended and unintended breakage this will cause is immense. Especially considering how common python is as a first programming language, and how hard shared memory concurrency is to teach. There was a real chance to make something better with the ongoing subinterpreter work plus some native lightweight communication channels ala erlang or go, but I fear the appetite for that will be significantly reduced now that this is in motion.Copyright © 2023, Eklektix, Inc.
