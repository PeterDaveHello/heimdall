    "originBody": "I Just Wanted Emacs to Look Nice — Using 24-Bit Color in Terminals Jan 27, 2024 - terminal Thanks to some coworkers and David Wilson’s Emacs from Scratch playlist, I’ve been getting back into Emacs. The community is more vibrant than the last time I looked, and LSP brings modern completion and inline type checking. David’s Emacs looks so fancy — I want nice colors and fonts too, especially my preferred themes like Solarized. From desktop environments, Emacs automatically supports 24-bit color. Graphical Emacs: Fonts and Colors But, since I work on infrastructure, I’ve lived primarily in terminals for years. And my Emacs looks like: Terminal Emacs: Not Fancy It turns out, for years, popular terminals have supported 24-bit color. And yet they’re rarely used. Like everything else, it boil down to legacy and politics. Control codes are a protocol, and changes to that protocol take time to propagate, especially with missteps along the way. This post is two things: how to enable true-color support in the terminal environments I use, and how my desire for nice colors in Emacs led to poring over technical standards from the 70s, 80s, and 90s, wondering how we got to this point. NOTE: I did my best, but please forgive any terminology slip-ups or false histories. I grew up on VGA text mode UIs, but never used a hardware terminal and wasn’t introduced to unix until much later. ANSI Escape Codes Early hardware terminals offered their own, incompatible, control code schemes. That made writing portable software hard, so ANSI standardized the protocol, while reserving room for expansion and vendor-specific capabilities. DEC VT100 (1978) ANSI escape codes date back to the 70s. They cover a huge range of functionality, but since this post is focused on colors, I’m mostly interested in SGR (Select Graphics Rendition), which allows configuring a variety of character display attributes: bold or intensity italics (not frequently supported) blink foreground and background colors and a bunch of other stuff. You can look at Wikipedia. 3-, 4-, and 8-bit Color When color was introduced, there were eight. Black, white, the additive primaries, and the subtractive primaries. The eight corners of an RGB color cube. Later, a bright (or bold) bit added eight more; “bright black” being dark gray. 4-Bit VGA Text Mode Palette In 1999, Todd Larason patched xterm to add support for 256 colors. He chose a palette that filled out the RGB color cube with a 6x6x6 interior sampling and added a 24-entry finer-precision grayscale ramp. Output From colortest-256 NOTE: There’s a rare, but still-supported, 88-color variant with a 4x4x4 color cube and 8-entry grayscale ramp, primarily to reduce the use of historically-limited X11 color objects. NOTE: We’ll debug this later, but Todd’s patch to add 256-color support to xterm used semicolons as the separator between the ANSI SGR command 48 and the color index, which set off a chain reaction of ambiguity we’re still dealing with today. Where Did 24-Bit Color Support Come From? It’s well-documented how to send 8-bit and 24-bit colors to compatible terminals. Per Wikipedia: ESC[38;5;m sets foreground color n per the palettes above. ESC[38;2;;;m sets foreground color (r, g, b). (Again, that confusion about semicolons vs. colons, and an unused colorspace ID if colons are used. We’ll get to the bottom of that soon.) But why 5? Why 2? How did any of this come about? I’d struggled enough with unexpected output that it was time to discover the ground truth. Finding and reading original sources led me to construct the following narrative: In the 70s, ANSI standardized terminal escape sequences, resulting in ANSI X3.64 and the better-known ECMA-48. The first edition of ECMA-48 is lost to time, but it probably looks much like ANSI X3.64. The 2nd edition of ECMA-48 (1979) allocated SGR parameters 30-37 and 40-47 for setting 3-bit foreground and background colors, respectively. By the way, these standards use the word “parameter” to mean command, and “subparameter” to mean argument, if applicable. The 3rd edition (1984) introduced the concept of an implementation-defined default color for both foreground and background, and allocated parameters 39 and 49, respectively. Somewhere in this timeline, vendors did ship hardware terminals with richer color support. The Wyse WY-370 introduced new color modes, including a direct-indexed 64-color palette. (See Page 86 of its Programmer’s Guide.) 38 and 48 are the most important parameters for selecting colors today, but they weren’t allocated by either the 4th (1986) or 5th (1991) editions. So where did they come from? The 5th edition gives a clue: reserved for future standardization; intended for setting character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT Recommendation T.416] ISO 8613 was a boondoggle of a project intended to standardize and replace all proprietary document file formats. You’ve never heard of it, so it obviously failed. But its legacy lives on – ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) (1993) built on ECMA-48’s codes and defined parameters 38 and 48 as extended foreground and background color modes, respectively. The first parameter element indicates a choice between: 0 implementation defined (only applicable for the character foreground colour) 1 transparent; 2 direct colour in RGB space; 3 direct colour in CMY space; 4 direct colour in CMYK space; 5 indexed colour. There we go! That is why 5 is used for 256-color mode and 2 is 24-bit RGB. Careful reading also gives a clue as to the semicolon vs. colon syntax screw-up. Note the subtle use of the term “parameter element” vs. “parameter”. If you read ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) and ECMA-48 closely, it’s not explicitly stated, but they seem to indicate that unknown parameters for commands like “select graphics rendition” should be ignored. And parameters are separated with semicolons. That implies ESC[38;5;3m should be interpreted, in terminals that don’t support SGR 38, as “unknown, ignored (38)”, “blinking (5)”, and “italicized (3)”. The syntax should use colons to separate sub-parameter components, but something got lost along the way. (Now, in practice, programs are told how to communicate with their terminals via the TERM variable and the terminfo database, so I don’t know how much pain occurs in reality.) Thomas Dickey has done a great job documenting the history of ncurses and xterm, and, lo and behold, explains exactly the origin of the ambiguous syntax: We used semicolon (like other SGR parameters) for separating the R/G/B values in the escape sequence, since a copy of ITU T.416 (ISO-8613-6) which presumably clarified the use of colon for this feature was costly. Using semicolon was incorrect because some applications could expect their parameters to be order-independent. As used for the R/G/B values, that was order-dependent. The relevant information, by the way, is part of ECMA-48 (not ITU T.416, as mentioned in Why only 16 (or 256) colors?). Quoting from section 5.4.2 of ECMA-48, page 12, and adding emphasis (not in the standard): Each parameter sub-string consists of one or more bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/10; the bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/09 represent the digits ZERO to NINE; bit combination 03/10 may be used as a separator in a parameter sub-string, for example, to separate the fractional part of a decimal number from the integer part of that number. and later on page 78, in 8.3.117 SGR – SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION, the description of SGR 38: (reserved for future standardization; intended for setting character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT Recommendation T.416]) Of course you will immediately recognize that 03/10 is ASCII colon, and that ISO 8613-6 necessarily refers to the encoding in a parameter sub-string. Or perhaps you will not. So it’s all because the ANSI and ISO standards are ridiculously expensive (to this day, these crappy PDF scans from the 90s and earlier are $200 USD!) and because they use a baroque syntax to denote ASCII characters. While writing this post, I had to keep man ascii open to match, for example, 03/10 to colon and 03/11 to semicolon. I guess it’s how standards were written back then. A Hacker News thread in the context of WezTerm gives more detail. So, to recap in the timeline: 1999: Thomas Dickey merged Todd Larason’s 256-color patches with ambiguous semicolon syntax. 2006: Konsole added support for 256-color and 24-bit truecolor using the same ambiguous syntax as xterm, with a follow-on discussion about colons vs. semicolons. The issue was noticed, but semicolon syntax was adopted anyway. 2012: Thomas Dickey fixed xterm to accept the standards-compliant syntax. 2016: Windows 10’s built-in console gained ANSI escape code support, including 24-bit colors. Unfortunately with the ambiguous semicolon syntax. 2019: Windows Terminal is released, with ANSI escape code support, but also using ambiguous semicolon syntax. 2022: Microsoft announced ecosystem-wide migration from the legacy framebuffer-based VGA-style console subsystem to ANSI terminal emulation, specifically using xterm as a guide. 2022: Konsole gains support for standards-compliant syntax. Okay, here’s what we’ve established: ANSI codes are widely supported, even on Windows. Truecolor support is either widely supported or (for example, on the Linux text mode terminal) at least recognized and mapped to a more limited palette. Semicolon syntax is the most compatible, though the unambiguous colon syntax is slowly spreading. I wrote a small colortest.rs program to test color support and attributes like reverse and italics to confirm the above in every terminal I use. Terminfo Now that we’ve established terminal capabilities and how to use them, the next trick is to convince software of varying lineages to detect and use the best color support available. Typically, this is done with the old terminfo library (or the even older termcap). Terminfo provides a database of terminal capabilities and the ability to generate appropriate escape sequences. The TERM environment variable tells programs which terminfo record to use. Its value is automatically forwarded over ssh connections. Terminfo uses ridiculous command names: infocmp, tic, toe. (Not to be confused with the unrelated tac.) To see the list of terminfo records installed on your host, run toe -a. (Do we /really/ need to install support for every legacy hardware terminal on modern machines? Good luck even finding a hardware terminal these days. They’re collector’s items.) infocmp is how you inspect the capabilities of a specific terminfo record. $ infocmp xterm-256color # Reconstructed via infocmp from file: /lib/terminfo/x/xterm-256color xterm-256color|xterm with 256 colors, am, bce, ccc, km, mc5i, mir, msgr, npc, xenl, colors#0x100, cols#80, it#8, lines#24, pairs#0x10000, acsc=``aaffggiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz{{||}}~~, bel=^G, blink=\\E[5m, bold=\\E[1m, cbt=\\E[Z, civis=\\E[?25l, clear=\\E[H\\E[2J, cnorm=\\E[?12l\\E[?25h, cr=\\r, csr=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dr, cub=\\E[%p1%dD, cub1=^H, cud=\\E[%p1%dB, cud1=, cuf=\\E[%p1%dC, cuf1=\\E[C, cup=\\E[%i%p1%d;%p2%dH, cuu=\\E[%p1%dA, cuu1=\\E[A, cvvis=\\E[?12;25h, dch=\\E[%p1%dP, dch1=\\E[P, dim=\\E[2m, dl=\\E[%p1%dM, dl1=\\E[M, ech=\\E[%p1%dX, ed=\\E[J, el=\\E[K, el1=\\E[1K, flash=\\E[?5h$\\E[?5l, home=\\E[H, hpa=\\E[%i%p1%dG, ht=^I, hts=\\EH, ich=\\E[%p1%d@, il=\\E[%p1%dL, il1=\\E[L, ind=, indn=\\E[%p1%dS, initc=\\E]4;%p1%d;rgb:%p2%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X/%p3%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X/%p4%{255}%*%{1000}%/%2.2X\\E\\\\, invis=\\E[8m, is2=\\E[!p\\E[?3;4l\\E[4l\\E>, kDC=\\E[3;2~, kEND=\\E[1;2F, kHOM=\\E[1;2H, kIC=\\E[2;2~, kLFT=\\E[1;2D, kNXT=\\E[6;2~, kPRV=\\E[5;2~, kRIT=\\E[1;2C, ka1=\\EOw, ka3=\\EOy, kb2=\\EOu, kbeg=\\EOE, kbs=^?, kc1=\\EOq, kc3=\\EOs, kcbt=\\E[Z, kcub1=\\EOD, kcud1=\\EOB, kcuf1=\\EOC, kcuu1=\\EOA, kdch1=\\E[3~, kend=\\EOF, kent=\\EOM, kf1=\\EOP, kf10=\\E[21~, kf11=\\E[23~, kf12=\\E[24~, kf13=\\E[1;2P, kf14=\\E[1;2Q, kf15=\\E[1;2R, kf16=\\E[1;2S, kf17=\\E[15;2~, kf18=\\E[17;2~, kf19=\\E[18;2~, kf2=\\EOQ, kf20=\\E[19;2~, kf21=\\E[20;2~, kf22=\\E[21;2~, kf23=\\E[23;2~, kf24=\\E[24;2~, kf25=\\E[1;5P, kf26=\\E[1;5Q, kf27=\\E[1;5R, kf28=\\E[1;5S, kf29=\\E[15;5~, kf3=\\EOR, kf30=\\E[17;5~, kf31=\\E[18;5~, kf32=\\E[19;5~, kf33=\\E[20;5~, kf34=\\E[21;5~, kf35=\\E[23;5~, kf36=\\E[24;5~, kf37=\\E[1;6P, kf38=\\E[1;6Q, kf39=\\E[1;6R, kf4=\\EOS, kf40=\\E[1;6S, kf41=\\E[15;6~, kf42=\\E[17;6~, kf43=\\E[18;6~, kf44=\\E[19;6~, kf45=\\E[20;6~, kf46=\\E[21;6~, kf47=\\E[23;6~, kf48=\\E[24;6~, kf49=\\E[1;3P, kf5=\\E[15~, kf50=\\E[1;3Q, kf51=\\E[1;3R, kf52=\\E[1;3S, kf53=\\E[15;3~, kf54=\\E[17;3~, kf55=\\E[18;3~, kf56=\\E[19;3~, kf57=\\E[20;3~, kf58=\\E[21;3~, kf59=\\E[23;3~, kf6=\\E[17~, kf60=\\E[24;3~, kf61=\\E[1;4P, kf62=\\E[1;4Q, kf63=\\E[1;4R, kf7=\\E[18~, kf8=\\E[19~, kf9=\\E[20~, khome=\\EOH, kich1=\\E[2~, kind=\\E[1;2B, kmous=\\E[, rmm=\\E[?1034l, rmso=\\E[27m, rmul=\\E[24m, rs1=\\Ec\\E]104\\007, rs2=\\E[!p\\E[?3;4l\\E[4l\\E>, sc=\\E7, setab=\\E[%?%p1%{8}% /dev/null; then echo \"$t\"; fi; done $ Nesting Terminals conhost.exe (WSL1) +-------------------------+mosh| +---------------------+|tmux|| +-----------------+||emacs terminal||| +-------------+|||$ ls|||| foo bar baz|||+-------------+||+-----------------+|+---------------------++-------------------------+ I’d never consciously considered this, but my typical workflow nests multiple terminals. I open a graphical terminal emulator on my local desktop, Windows, Mac, or Linux. I mosh to a remote machine or VM. I start tmux. I might then use a terminal within Emacs or Asciinema or GNU Screen. Yes, there are situations where it’s useful to have some screen sessions running inside or outside of tmux. Each of those layers is its own implementation of the ANSI escape sequence state machine. For 24-bit color to work, every single layer has to understand and accurately translate the escape sequences from the inner TERM value’s terminfo to the outer terminfo. Therefore, you need recent-enough versions of all of this software. Current LTS Ubuntus only ship with mosh 1.3, so I had to enable the mosh-dev PPA. TERM must be set correctly within each terminal: tmux-direct within tmux, for example. There is no standard terminfo for mosh, so you have to pick something close enough. Graphical Terminal Emulators Most terminals either set TERM to a reasonable default or allow you to override TERM. I use Konsole, but I think you could find a similar option in whichever you use. Konsole's TERM value selection ssh Often, the first thing I do when opening a terminal is to ssh somewhere else. Fortunately, this is easy, as long as the remote host has the same terminfo record. ssh carries your TERM value into the new shell. tmux But then you load tmux and TERM is set to screen! To fix this, override default-terminal in your ~/.tmux.conf: set -g default-terminal \"tmux-direct\" For extra credit, consider setting tmux-direct conditionally with %if when the outer TERM supports 24-bit color, otherwise leaving the default of screen or tmux-256color. And then let me know how you did it. :P mosh While recent mosh does support 24-bit color, it only advertises 8 or 256 colors. Thus, it’s up to you to set TERM appropriately. Mosh aims for xterm compatibility, but unfortunately only supports semicolon syntax for SGR 38 and 48, so TERM=xterm-direct does not work. So far, I’ve found that vscode-direct is the closest to xterm-direct. There is no convenient “I’m running in mosh” variable, so I wrote a detect-mosh.rs Rust script and called it from .bashrc: unamer=$(uname -r) unameo=$(uname -o) if [[ ! \"$TMUX\" ]]; then if [[ \"$unamer\" == *Microsoft ]]; then # WSL 1 export TERM=vscode-direct elif [[ \"$unameo\" == Cygwin ]]; then # Eh, could just configure mintty to set mintty-direct. export TERM=vscode-direct elif detect-mosh 2>/dev/null; then # This should be xterm-direct, but mosh does not understand SGR # colon syntax. export TERM=vscode-direct fi fi It works by checking whether the shell process is a child of mosh-server. The jury’s still out on whether it’s a good idea to compile Rust in the critical path of login, especially into an underpowered host like my Intel Atom NAS or a Raspberry Pi. It Works! Beautiful Emacs themes everywhere! Emacs within tmux within mosh This was a ton of work, but I learned a lot, and, perhaps most importantly, I now feel confident I could debug any kind of wonky terminal behavior in the future. To recap: Terminals don’t agree on syntax and capabilities. Terminfo is how those capabilities are queried. Terminfo is often limited, sometimes inaccurate, and new terminfo versions are released infrequently. What’s Next? If you were serious about writing software to take full advantage of modern terminal capabilities, it would be time to break from terminfo. I imagine such a project would look like this: Continue to use the TERM variable because it’s well-supported. Give programs knowledge of terminals independent of the age of the operating system or distribution they’re running on: Programs would link with a frequently-updated (Rust?) library. Said library would contain a (modern!) terminfo database representing, say, the last 10 years of terminal emulators, keyed on (name, version). Notably, the library would not pretend to support any hardware terminals, because they no longer exist. We can safely forget about padding, for example. Continue to support the terminfo file format and OS-provided terminfo files on disk, with some protocol for determining which information is most-up-to-date. Allow an opt-in TERMVERSION to differentiate between the capabilities of, for example, 2022’s Konsole and 2023’s Konsole. Allow describing modern terminal capabilities (like 24-bit color, 256-color palette animation, URL links, Kitty’s graphics protocol) in an accurate, unambiguous format, independent of the timeline of new ncurses releases. Backport modern terminal descriptions to legacy programs by providing a program to be run by .bashrc that: Uses TERM and TERMVERSION to generate a binary terminfo file in $HOME/.terminfo/, which ncurses knows how to discover. Generates unambiguous 24-bit color capabilities like RGB, setf24, and setb24, despite the fact that getting them added to terminfo has been politically untenable. Otherwise, assumes RGB-unaware programs will assume the 256-color palette, and leaves colors#0x100, initc, oc in place. Palette animation is a useful, widely-supported feature.

It's weird to think just how much complexity goes into a terminal application. Makes me even more grateful to the devs behind iTerm and Kitty (and all the others!) EDIT: for iTerm+zsh, I collected some functions for setting tab colors: https://gist.github.com/aclarknexient/84ebe33c1879f921685304... EDIT2: Contrast terminfo with the old-school method of connecting to HTTP or SMTP with telnet. Yeah, it's simple text but that text is being displayed by a complex application that supports all sorts of wild stuff! reply vidarh 18 hours agoparentI use my own terminal, and early made the decision not to give a shit about terminfo, pretend to be rxvt, and deal with the fallout (now, admittedly, the only user I care about for my terminal is me - at least for now). Modern terminals supports enough of a shared subset that it's less painful doing that than having to deal with applications get all confused because they don't recognize your TERM variable, to the point where I've typically found the closest match whenever I've used a less common terminal in the past too. (This matters less if you don't regularly ssh into new systems, of course) reply JoshTriplett 15 hours agorootparentAbsolutely agreed. The main problem with that is providing new features that xterm doesn't support, but terminfo pretty much refuses to add new features anyway, so modern terminals have had to work around that with some combination of autodetection, separate environment variables, or YOLO approaches. So, at this point, I'm not sure it's worth supporting terminfo at all for most applications, either as a terminal emulator or as a CLI program. (The article makes a similar point about the negative value terminfo is providing for modern applications.) If you're building a program that takes over the terminal screen, you probably should use one of the established libraries that abstracts over terminfo and over old non-ANSI Windows consoles. But if you're doing light terminal handling in an application that doesn't take over the screen, such as emitting colors or doing simple cursor control, forget about terminfo and just handle two or three cases: ANSI, optionally old pre-ANSI Windows consoles, and files/terminals with no support for anything. Rounding ancient terminals or terminal emulators to \"no support\" and giving them the same thing you'd give a redirection to a file seems entirely reasonable for a new program. reply bitwize 2 hours agorootparentJust... please please please call isatty() and don't barf ANSI cruft into my buffers. reply vidarh 38 minutes agorootparentI'd frankly far prefer people not to call isatty(), and require switches for machine-readable output. The kind of tools that \"barf ANSI cruft\" are usually the tools I want to do so even when I'm piping their output into something else. It's a real nuisance to e.g. deal with options to preserve colours through a pipe for every element. There might well be exceptions where I'd prefer to default to checking isatty(), but they are few. If there was any remotely standard way of signaling the preferred default, and a remotely standard command line option to toggle that default, it'd make things a lot nicer, because I totally understand where you're coming from; I get equally annoyed just in the opposite scenarios, so the situation is a nuisance for both of us. reply kps 17 hours agorootparentprev> pretend to be rxvt, and deal with the fallout (now, admittedly, the only user I care about for my terminal is me - at least for now It's fine when it's just you. Unfortunately, there are some widely used terminals that default to claiming to be xterm, but are not xterm compatible. reply vidarh 17 hours agorootparentFrankly, I find most work well enough with xterm or rxvt termcaps to prefer that over having apps just refuse to even try to work until you've changed settings. But conversely, if distributed like that, I'd also feel that this implicitly means any failure to act like xterm is a bug they've implicitly suggested it is reasonable to report or complain about (and if the version number doesn't imply it's an early stage release, and it still doesn't work well with its defaults, I'd get cranky) reply o11c 8 hours agorootparentprevIf you send feature-detection queries it doesn't matter. The nasty part is that RXVT violates ISO 2022 structure in weird ways. It's not alone in that, but most of the other-program violations are much more easily fixed. reply bloopernova 18 hours agorootparentprevThat's fascinating! Did you have a specific itch you wanted to scratch by writing your own terminal? Or was it a learning project that you found useful? reply vidarh 17 hours agorootparentA combination of a procrastination project, wanting a pure Ruby library I can use for output from hybrid applications (e.g. my editor) to be able to have a mostly terminal UI but being able to add in limited graphics when available, and wanting a testbed for other terminal changes I want to experiment with in terms of creating more of a hybrid UI. A basic terminal can be fairly small - mine is ~1800 lines of Ruby at the moment, which I consider disappointingly large. For comparison st is ~8k lines, I think, and xterm is ~88k. But you can do a working terminal in far less than my 1800, even in more verbose languages, so it's a nice space to play in where you can get something that works in very little (set TERM to a dumber terminal than rxvt, dump any escape sequences your terminal doesn't yet understand to a log, and run the apps you need, then iterate...), and build up in whichever direction you want to something quite usable very quickly. Then you can spend a lifetime polishing quirky little details nobody with you will ever care about... ;) reply tambourine_man 17 hours agorootparentprevI’d like to know more of the motivations for building your own terminal. Are you using a library or written all from scratch? reply vidarh 17 hours agorootparentSee a lengthier reply elsewhere in this thread, re: motivations etc. but it's almost all from scratch. Frankly, a simple terminal is not a huge amount of work, and you can get something working \"well enough\" to start with with very little code. The huge amount of work comes from nailing all the quirks you will have to deal with if you let a bunch of other users loose on it, with their expectations of running all kinds of applications I've never tested that does weird stuff. reply tambourine_man 17 hours agorootparentYeah, the last 10%. I saw your reply after posting mine, thanks. reply ddingus 10 hours agorootparentFamously the last 90% of the project :( reply liamwire 6 hours agoparentprevAny chance you’d be willing to share some screenshots of the tab colours in action? reply bloopernova 2 hours agorootparentGood point, I'll add some tomorrow. reply assimpleaspossi 10 minutes agoprevIn my case, I don't care. Give me plain black and white all day long--and I do. When you have that many colors on the screen it no longer is helpful and only becomes a blur of clown colors. If you must, use just a couple of colors--or even just shades of gray or bold--to highlight important things like functions. But that's what indentation is for. You indent/format your code to help find things. It seems to work well in books. And that works everywhere without any work involved to make it happen. reply barrkel 17 hours agoprevI found it easier to tune the 16 color palette in each of my various terminal apps than to try and get application-side terminal codes just right. In my ~/.Xdefaults for rxvt-unicode: ! yellow Rxvt*color3:rgb:F5/79/00 ! magenta Rxvt*color5:rgb:AD/7F/A8 ! cyan Rxvt*color6:rgb:88/8A/85 ! white Rxvt*color7:rgb:BA/BD/B6 ! ...

The raw 16 color palette is too saturated and often has bad contrast. reply rollcat 14 hours agoparent> (if (display-graphic-p) This right here. Emacs actually supports graphical output (X11, Cocoa, Win32). Additional bonuses include: Esc is actually Esc; you can bind Ctrl+Shift or Cmd; you can use more than one font at a time; you can display a picture; change the shape of the cursor...

If not add the following to .bashrc, .zshrc, .fishrc (you know the drill): export COLORTERM=truecolor (reload the shell, or just execute this line and start emacs -nw again, voila.) For some reason, this article makes it look like you need to dig into terminfo, generally you won't need to, maybe 10 years ago, not now.

This is mentioned in a footnote in the linked Emacs document about detecting truecolor support, and it appears in their Konsole screenshot, but I suspect it got lost inside their layers of terminal multiplexers (as, I find, it often does). It lets you skip past all this hard stuff straight to the part where the app understands that you want true color. A terminfo database isn't even required. reply chadaustin 15 hours agoparentYou're right: I should have included COLORTERM in this history, and a couple of the other fits and starts, like the `RGB` terminfo capability. The issue I had with COLORTERM is that not every program respects it. In fact, I've had this in my .bashrc for a while: case $TERM in linuxscreen*) unset COLORTERM ;; *) export COLORTERM=truecolor ;; esac (Screen does support 24-bit color now, so that case probably came from Ubuntu 18.) reply csdvrx 14 hours agorootparentAgreed - COLORTERM has its own problem. I prefer your approach, it looks very sound! A fork of terminfo may be needed if the description of modern terminal capabilities can't be added -- or if old and deprecated attributes repurposed for that job (like in your padding example): if you're automating the correction/creation of terminfos in ~/, IMHO, it may be better to piggyback on tic as much as possible. Anyway, to backport modern terminal descriptions to legacy programs, creating correct binary terminfos in ~/.terminfo seems the best practice. You can also invent new TERM. When I wanted to have italics etc about everywhere, personally that's just what I did for sixel-tmux: https://github.com/csdvrx/sixel-tmux/?tab=readme-ov-file#ste... : just declare a new $TERM you know to be right, and use that in the apps that let you use a little logic in their configuration file I do that in my .vimrc: \" If Vim doesn't know the escape codes to switch to italic let &t_ZH=\"\\e[3m\" let &t_ZR=\"\\e[23m\" \" Italics pseudo-auto toggle: force italics if we recognize it's supported from TERM if match($TERM, \"xterm-256color-italic\")==0 highlight Comment cterm=italic endif BTW you should package your emacs config file with the emacs APE from https://cosmo.zip/pub/cosmos/bin/emacs to do a cuteemacs, to carry your config files and everything in a portable binary: https://github.com/csdvrx/CuteVim Another idea: have you considered that the \"program that would be run by .bashrc\" to generate the \"unambiguous 24-bit color capabilities\" could set environment variables to communicate them? Like, if you can't stuff them in terminfo, stuff them in environment variables! Env var work well on Windows, and the configuration files of terminal programs could just use these when available to override.

Emacs is my terminal emulator. All my terminal programs get run in a (graphical) emacs shell-mode buffer. The rare program that needs full screen control uses term-mode. It's not the most featureful or fastest terminal emulator, but I can jump around the buffer like any other buffer and seamlessly access it along with the other content I'm editing. On a remote computer where I can't run a graphical emacs, I either remotely edit files via tramp, or run a headless emacs server process and connect remotely with a graphical emacsclient. reply ghosty141 7 minutes agorootparentCould you explain the part about the headless emacs server? I thought emacsclient only worked locally. reply radarsat1 12 hours agorootparentprevI also use emacs graphically, somehow I managed to switch after years of using it in the terminal and now I prefer it. However, I've never managed to settle on any of the terminal emulation modes. Just too many keyboard shortcut conflicts and complicated magic to remember how to copy and paste between different types of buffers. These days I've pretty much settled on having and emacs window and GNOME Terminal side by side as my two main work windows, and it's pretty comfortable. I like that I can mouse select and copy from the terminal window and then C-y into emacs and vice versa. If I really have some need I might still open a shell or ansi-term session but it's pretty rare now. Sometimes it's convenient when I find myself in a remote shell session and want to have a text editor and shell vertically tiled, I'll just run emacs with ansiterm because for the life of me I can't ever remember the screen keyboard shortcuts for splitting windows. reply hollerith 13 hours agorootparentprevI do that, too, for the reason you describe, except instead of shell mode, I use a mode I wrote myself. reply m463 11 hours agoparentprevI agree.

Getting it not to hang the display of the buffer list or lock up Emacs completely for minutes at a time requires a deep dive in to a decade of Stack Overflow breadcrumbs. I've done this, and I'm still not completely satisfied with the performance. I do however love the concept. reply db48x 15 hours agorootparentNo, it requires only one thing: turn on persistent SSH connections. This means that new SSH connections to the same server do not actually require opening a new TCP connection, do not require negotiating new session keys, and do not require additional authentication. To turn this on, add these settings to your ~/.ssh/config file: ControlMaster auto ControlPersist yes ControlPath ~/.ssh/control/%C You should also use key–based authentication so that TRAMP never has to ask for a password, but this is less important once you are using persistent connections. Add something like this to your ssh config: Host orod-na-thon Hostname 192.168.2.133 User db48x IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_your_private_key Now go to Emacs and open up /ssh:orod-na-thon:~/.ssh/authorized_keys. This is the TRAMP path for your authorized_keys file on the machine named orod-na-thon. It will ask you for your password. Paste in your public key (which you can get by opening up the .pub file that goes alongside the private key in ~/ssh), and save it. Now future connections to orod-na-thon will be able to authenticate automatically using this key pair, and there will be no password prompt when you open a file there. reply cycomanic 14 hours agorootparentOne problem that I looked briefly into, but have not found a solution is that often I'm browsing the file system (in a terminal) on the remote box and want to open up a file in a certain location (often just for a quick edit). The process of typing pwd, and copying the location into emacs (similar applies to Neovim) already is too much friction, that it's easier to just open the barebones Vim on the remote. Anyone aware of a solution of how to start the local editor from the remote to open the remote file? reply db48x 14 hours agorootparentBest solution to that is to use Eshell. Run `M-x eshell` to open the shell inside Emacs (on your local machine), then type `cd /ssh:orod-na-thon:path/to/files`. This will transparently ssh to the server and change to the path to your files. The `ls` command will now show the files that exist on the remote server rather than the local computer. You might now expect that there would be an eshell command that you could type to open a remote file in your local Emacs, but there isn’t. No, in Emacs you always open a file by typing `C-x C-f`. (Unless you rebound it to some other key, in which case make the obvious substitution.) Any time you hit `C-x C-f` to open a file it defaults to opening files from the working directory of the current buffer. The working directory of the eshell buffer is on the remote server, so the default list of files that you see are all the ones you were already looking at with `ls`. You can start typing a filename and autocomplete will do the rest. This is an even deeper and more convenient composition of the shell and the editor than having special commands for tasks like opening a remote file in the local editor. reply ngai_aku 9 hours agorootparent> You might now expect that there would be an eshell command that you could type to open a remote file in your local Emacs, but there isn’t.

Its really neat, until you try to sshing somewhere. If the remote system doesn't have kitty in its terminfo, nothing works. Kitty's \"solution\" to this is to use a custom ssh wrapper, which I'm sorry, is not an acceptable solution. A simple solution would be to let users override what TERM gets set to, but they refuse to allow this on some moral ground. Maybe I'll try it again in a few years when its in more terminfo packages. reply jrockway 16 hours agoparentI just type 'export TERM=xterm' whenever I log onto one of these systems (I use tmux-direct as my $TERM). It seems like Debian 12 has a lot of newer terminfos these days in the default install, and I've tried to upgrade most places I ssh to that. Like our CI system can take a Docker image as the place where your code runs; so instead of using the default one from 2018 or whatever, I just made my own that has all these niceties. (I use kitty on Mac and Windows Terminal on Windows, but it ends up not mattering because I'm always in tmux, so that's the terminfo that remote machines need. I never bothered setting up 24 bit color though, so I have no idea if that would work with my setup. I switched to TERM=tmux-direct to get italic fonts in Emacs running on Linux inside tmux inside an SSH session from Windows Terminal. It works!) reply shirro 11 hours agoparentprevThe distros I use (debian, arch) have a kitty-terminfo package. First thing I install when I ssh into a machine.

Speaking of deploys, how are your Q1 OKRs shaping up? reply vulcan01 15 hours agorootparentprevThat is what kitty's \"custom SSH wrapper\" does, if I understand correctly. Each time you ssh into a server, it will copy kitty's terminfo file if it doesn't already exist. I use the ssh kitten, it works fine. reply db48x 14 hours agorootparentOh, that’s nice. I don’t see why anyone would be against using that. reply IshKebab 16 hours agoparentprevYeah that's silly. TERM is as broken as web user-agents.

Unless you're showing pictures in your terminal, why would you want true color and the overhead that introduces? If you're just doing a status bar on a black background, your eye won't really see the difference between FF0000 and FF1515 (which I picked because the next 16 bit color is FF3333 which you can already barely tell the difference from). I'm just saying I'm not sure I would want that much color choice, it would just give me anxiety about picking the right color! reply spudlyo 15 hours agoparent> I'm just saying I'm not sure I would want that much color choice, it would just give me anxiety about picking the right color! Developers of themes for Emacs often target the GUI first, where 24-bit color is the default. If you're a hardcore terminal Emacs user (and there are many legit reasons for this) you're stuck by default with 256 colors, and the themes just don't look right due to having to map the carefully chosen colors to the nearest color in the 256 color palette. reply chadaustin 15 hours agorootparentExactly correct. Loading solarized in 256-color emacs shows just how poorly the (carefully-selected) Solarized colors map onto the xterm-256color palette. reply bhaak 14 hours agoparentprevIt clearly depends on what you do but having more colors is nice. Even if 256 colors are available it's not enough. The palette of the 256 colors is gruesome. You can clearly see that a technical person without any knowledge of color theory designed it. reply omaranto 11 hours agoprevWow, this looks so much harder than simply running GUI Emacs. reply globular-toast 16 hours agoprevHmm... My Emacs has just worked with full colour in terminal for years. I didn't know it was a thing that needed to be configured. Skimming through the article I hope I never have to know this stuff. I also have icons in my terminal by using nerd icons. reply spudlyo 16 hours agoparentThe article is a deep dive on the evolution on terminal color, mentioning some of the \"colorful\" characters in the scene. This is specifically about the ultimate 24-bit expression of gawdy terminal bling, aka COLORTERM=truecolor. Perhaps you're not the kind of person who would notice if their Emacs color theme looked wrong because the theme designer's carefully chosen 24-bit color was mapped to the nearest color in the 256 color palette of the stock terminal. reply globular-toast 14 hours agorootparentOh, I am that kind of person, believe me. Mine looks identical in the terminal. I use zenburn theme. The only thing I ever set in my bashrc is `TERM=xterm-256color`. I'm not sure why. I do have `COLORTERM=truecolor` set, but I didn't do it myself. It just works for me with or without those variables set in both xterm and alacritty. reply austinshea 16 hours agoprevThis is fantastic!

There's plenty of stuff that Emacs don't that VSCode doesn't do very easily. reply shmerl 7 hours agoprev> It turns out, for years, popular terminals have supported 24-bit color. And yet they’re rarely used. Hard to say how rarely. I've been using 24-bit color in bash prompts and neovim scheme for a while. Can't go back to 16 or 256 color ones, they are just too limited. I wish tty terminal also supported 24-bit color. For setting the color in bash I use something like: printf \"\\x1b[38;2;${r};${g};${b}m\" or printf \"\\x1b[${f};38;2;${r};${g};${b}m\" If I need to set extra bits like bold. reply medo-bear 16 hours agoprevGreat article !

Think of it as an open alternative to cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems. You can self-host Ubicloud or use our managed service. I find this hard to parse and the first few times I thought you were saying it's a linux alternative. I just clicked to the docs and the \"What is Ubicloud?\" section is clearer because you say concretely and directly what it is rather than how I should think of it metaphorically: \"infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) features on providers that lease bare metal instances, such as Hetzner, OVH, and AWS Bare Metal. It’s also available as a managed service.\" There's some old \"counterintuitive\" adage I'm too lazy to look up about how the best marketing to engineers is just saying in concrete language what it is rather than the benefit it provides. In this case, I'd do both: tell me what it actually is and why that makes it cheaper/better. Also a minor note, there's a typo in that paragraph (missing space \"systems.Ubicloud\"). reply robertlagrant 15 hours agoparentIf we're doing nits, because this product looks cool, here are a couple of potential tweaks: > Imagine to do more I'd get rid of this. I don't understand the phrase, and it sounds like fluff. > Fast runs even at this price point I'd get rid of the \"point\". \"Price point\" isn't a synonym for \"price\", which I think is what's being attempted here.

So, while this is the first time I've heard of ubicloud, I use gha extensively. Abd frankly, I think it's just because Github has a crazy markup on their actions compute over the raw compute. Taking a quick look, it appears that their base rate is like $0.008 per-minute!! That's a rate that wouldn't look crazy out of line with EC2's hourly rate. I've worked on projects where we saved significant money, and improved build times just by launching a single EC2 instance and connecting it to Actions. reply pinkgolem 15 hours agorootparentIops on GitHub runners is also terrible slow, you easily get a 5x to 10x improvement We did the same, and set up GitHub actions runners on hetzner Halfed the integration test time and made them more reliable. reply crohr 1 hour agorootparentJust a catch with Hetzner vs AWS: pricing at AWS is per-second while Hetzner is per-hour, which is (very) inconvenient if you're launching ephemeral runners. reply password4321 15 hours agorootparentprevI've heard CI/CD in general and GitHub Actions specifically is where old cloud hardware goes until it dies. reply umur 13 hours agoparentprevThank you for your feedback!

It must have been 2009ish. I was at Microsoft. Part of the code I was responsible for ran on the Windows build servers. This code was triggering a kernel bug in the Windows registry. The only way I knew how to reproduce it was by building Windows. Because thousands of Windows builds happened per day, maybe 1 of them would hit it every 1-3 days. The way I got it in a kernel debugger was to constantly run the problematic race condition inside a VM, when it detected that it hadn't hit, it would roll back the VM to a save state of the code already running in progress ... Took an overnight run to hit it on a machine in the office. All that said, I'd still say it's not very expensive to run a build machine. reply necubi 16 hours agoprevWe've been using Ubicloud builders for our Rust project [0] for several months, and it's worked very well.

[1]: https://runs-on.com reply ploxiln 15 hours agorootparentprevAlso consider the carbon footprint of using caches! Apparently it takes longer, because it has to send/recv more data, compress and decompress, cause load on other systems ... It's really kinda impossible to judge the carbon footprint for these kinds of things, and if it's justified. Consider the carbon footprint of all the dumb AI feature rolled out at Facebook, Google, etc. Consider the carbon footprint of everyone trying to use ChatGPT now.

Is it worth it? ... who can judge eh reply sophiabits 10 hours agorootparentThere’s a French think tank called “The Shift Project” which actually produced a report estimating CO2 impact of data transfer a few years ago [1]! The numbers are obviously very rough; there’s a LOT of factors to consider and which vary from one node to another. But the methodology is quite comprehensive, e.g. they factor in power consumption of the end user’s device while waiting for the data to transfer over the wire Green software engineering is interesting to me because it seems like a good way to impact greenhouse gases _without_ requiring consumers to change anything about their lifestyle (which is the hard part of climate change…) There’s a cool presentation from Rasmus Lerdorf from around the time when PHP7 released where he estimated a 50% adoption rate of PHP7 would result in a saving of 3.5B kg CO2/year iirc, purely because of the compute efficiency gains from PHP6 -> PHP7. I used their numbers to calculate that swapping our CI/CD clones at my day job over to shallow clones saved (maybe) 5.5 kg/week of CO2 emissions [2]. Not quite as impressive as the PHP7 figures, but I still think it’s kinda neat.

I've been looking at the repository and noticed that some jobs are still running on Github hosted runners.

We never bothered to switch those over because they complete quickly on github and fit within our included runner minutes. I should say we also use BuiltJet for docker builds because of their arm support. Now that ubicloud has arm we may switch those over as well. reply csdvrx 16 hours agoparentprev> One counter-intuitive thing we found is that it's slow to save and restore caches, but the machines have good CPU, so for us it's been faster to disable cache entirely and just redo everything on each build. The link to SPDK was very interesting: https://www.ubicloud.com/blog/building-block-storage-for-clo.... I use filesystems for very high performance applications, and I've found ZFS to often be the limiting factor when compared to simpler solutions of XFS +- mdadm +- encryption. It's a controversial point, but others have made similar findings: https://klarasystems.com/articles/virtualization-showdown-fr... : \"Although I suspect this will surprise many readers, it didn’t surprise me personally—I’ve been testing guest storage performance for OpenZFS and Linux KVM for more than a decade, and zvols have performed poorly by comparison each time I’ve tested them\" OpenZFS seems to be starting to consider optimizations to better perform on modern drivers (SSD, NVMe) which have very different performance profiles to what ZFS was built for (spinning rust) In the SPDK summary they say \"To make VM provisioning times go faster, we changed our host OS from ext4 to btrfs\" (...) \"Also, when we switched the host filesystem to btrfs, our disk performance degraded notably. Our disk throughput dropped to about one-third of what it was with ext4.\" Ubicloud: the problem seems to be generic to CoW filesystems, and it's interesting you came with a slight variation (CoA) but have you considered the even simpler alternative of any journaling filesystems (XFS, Ext4...) with overlays? Or just UFS2 + snapshots to restore from a given state (initialized, ready for each test) then restore to this state between tests? I think customers finding that disabling cache works better means the CoA has similar issues to CoW. Personally, I'd have just tried to using SR-IOV with a namespace per customer, and call it a day instead of bringing extra complexity, but there must be good reasons for it. I'd love to know what these reasons are. reply necubi 15 hours agorootparentIn this case, I don't think the issue is due to filesystem performance. Someone from Ubicloud can correct me, but my understanding is that for custom runners Github still stores the cache on their side. So Ubicloud (in Europe) needs to transfer the cache from Github (in the US) on every run. reply pwmtr 15 hours agorootparentHi, I work for Ubicloud. Yes, that is correct. We are also working on implementing our own caching, which should speed up cache downloads/uploads significantly. reply ozgune 17 hours agoprevHi there, I'm Ozgun, one of Ubicloud's founders. We have dozens of customers using Ubicloud runners in production today. We’re now designing our caching layer (Docker instance registry, Docker layer cache, or package cache).

Also, if you have any points related to the broader topic of an open and portable cloud, please pass them along! reply maxmcd 11 hours agoparentYes, please do what Depot does and put fast persistent disks close to builds to cache docker layers. Github action runners and circleci and all the others adding expensive network calls to manually cache layers has always been such a time sink and I think moves lots of people to remove caching entirely. reply kylegalbraith 4 hours agorootparentDepot [0] founder here. Thanks for the mention. We're also planning on bringing a bit of a different take to GitHub Action runners that's not tied to Hetzner directly. It will be entirely open-source as well, so you can take it and run it on your own instances if you'd like. Similar to how Depot supports self-hosted builders in your own AWS account [1].

Saved over $25k in CI costs compared to GH Actions - they're also using super powerful bare metal servers with Hetzner - we got about a 94% reduction in build time! Absolutely chuffed, good to see more companies on the market though. [0] https://buildjet.com reply hangonhn 17 hours agoprevOur biggest GHA fees come from running on MacOS. Do you offer MacOS as a managed service (or plan to?) and how much cheaper is that than GitHub? reply ozgune 16 hours agoparentNot for the foreseeable future. Ubicloud runs on bare metal providers and they don't lease Mac hardware. Technically, we could run MacOS VMs on arm64. However, our interpretation of Apple's End User License Agreement (EULA) tells us that we can't do this. This repo has some good references on the topic: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM?tab=readme-ov-file#is-this... reply dewey 16 hours agorootparentWould something like https://www.macstadium.com work for your use case? reply hangonhn 15 hours agorootparentThat's exactly what we had looked at but we didn't want to be in the business of maintaining our own instances. We just want to use the GH runner part. reply HideousKojima 16 hours agoparentprevBiggest issue with MacOS is that it requires a physical Mac (not virtualization) and IIRC the licening from Apple requires a minimum \"rental\" period of 24 hours or something like that Edit: the TOS for OS X says this: 3. Leasing for Permitted Developer Services. A. Leasing. You may lease or sublease a validly licensed version of the Apple Software in its entirety to an individual or organization (each, a “Lessee”) provided that all of the following conditions are met: (i) the leased Apple Software must be used for the sole purpose of providing Permitted Developer Services and each Lessee must review and agree to be bound by the terms of this License; (ii) each lease period must be for a minimum period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours; reply yla92 10 hours agorootparentWhat I did for work was, getting a Mac Mini and set up multiple self hosted runners in Tmux (very hackish, I know). The builds became faster (and cheaper) because each run no longer had to download the dependencies again. Of course, hosting myself means I also gotta own the uptime of it.. reply mysteria 9 hours agorootparentprevHow does Github Actions get away with this? They certainly don't bill and provide the machine for 24 hours for each CI run. reply suryao 16 hours agoparentprevWe support GitHub MacOS 13 runners on M2 Pros at WarpBuild [1].

I'm willing to create an organization and move the repository, but I won't bother if it's right around the corner. macOS ARM runners are a gamechanger given the offensively high pricing GitHub offers them at. reply suryao 12 hours agorootparentWe're not prioritizing personal accounts at this point, one of the reasons being to limit spammy accounts. Sorry about the hassle - you sound like a genuine user. reply electroly 9 hours agorootparentNo worries. I've already created the organization; I doubt this will impact many serious users. I look forward to seeing your new Mac support on HN as a top level submission. Since GitHub doesn't give free macOS ARM minutes at all, this should be immediately interesting to anyone running such builds. reply joshstrange 16 hours agorootparentprevNice, I don't think you supported them last I looked. I'll be glad to get off GH's mac runners which are straight garbage, like it's embarrassing or it should be for them. The sheer audacity to charge 10x the linux runners and still be so slow... At 10x price they are 2x+ slower than the linux runners for doing the same thing (checking out repo, installing dependencies, running webpack). reply suryao 15 hours agorootparentThat is correct. We went live with them about a week ago. Will likely introduce it to the HN friends in the next couple of days. I agree with the stuff you've mentioned, obviously, but also empathize a bit with the GitHub folks because of all the licences and limitations Mac runners come with. The perf for comparable operations is squarely on them though. reply mike_hearn 15 hours agorootparentprevI'm curious what you need macOS for if you're doing a JS project.

I hope Ubicloud will be even more successful than the previous project, Citus! reply lpgauth 15 hours agoprevOne thing I find frustrating about the Github Actions's runner pricing is that it's calculated on a minute basis. Couldn't you bill by the second instead? Maybe set a minimum to 1 min but after that charge by the second? I assume this is done to cover the time that the VM reboots between jobs? reply suryao 12 hours agoparentThis is exactly what we do at WarpBuild, more in the interest of fairness and not passing on random costs to users. The VM reboot times add up quickly and that's likely the rationale. However, it gets hard when there are users running linting jobs that take ~2s but running it with 16vcpu instances so we kept the 1 min floor. reply tmpfs 3 hours agoprevThis looks great and the pricing is obviously a big improvement, I will try it out for our Linux jobs. Sure would be good to see competition for the MacOS and Windows runners too, these are the ones that tend to cost us the most. reply JoshTriplett 16 hours agoprevSigh.

One thing that helps quite a bit imho is to avoid virtualization -- our approach is to run all CI jobs in containers, not VMs. Yes this has isolation implications, and requires some futzing to get docker-in-docker and docker-in-docker-in-docker to work (shout out to the Earthly team for figuring out how to host kind/k8s inside a container), but the \"runs on any computer\" property of containers (vs virtualization) is powerful. Want CI on your laptop? No problem. On a Windows machine? No problem. reply belthesar 16 hours agoparentprevFor what it's worth, you can also self host your runners without Ubicloud on Github. That doesn't remove other reasons to not run Gitlab, but it's also not unique.

On GitHub provided runners you need to explicitly move data between jobs. I find that useful in preventing weird side effects in one job affecting another. reply amenghra 16 hours agoparentprevIf the data is also encrypted at rest (as they claim it is), then even if the raw data is recovered it shouldn't be useable without a combination of key leak. reply fdr 16 hours agorootparentI work at Ubicloud. Although we have a KEK and DEK code for regular VMs, they are not operative on GHA...yet. The reason has to do with a technical conflict with copy-on-write we aim to close, not least of which because Ubicloud needs to grow its own copy-on-write features for block device snapshots, things we lack today. I expect within a few months, all expired GHA vms will be cryptoshredded upon their deletion. This is already true for regular virtual machines or managed postgres machines. reply csdvrx 16 hours agorootparent> because Ubicloud needs to grow its own copy-on-write features for block device snapshots, things we lack today. Just, why? CoW (or your own CoA) are ripe with performance problems.

I’d like to see an amendment to the Constitution to update the fourth amendment for the modern era, where a huge amount of information can be gathered about people without “searches and seizures”. The general issue of data collection is obviously one of the largest of our time, but I think most people would agree our own government should not be using our money (or debt) to legally circumvent our rights. reply caseysoftware 18 hours agoparentThis goes back to Third Party Doctrine. It's the premise that once you give up data to a third party, you no longer have any \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" so therefore it's not a search. There is similar case law backing up searching your garbage can. While it's up against your house (aka still under your control), you have rights to it.. once you put it on the street for the garbage truck to collect, you've surrendered those rights. I'm NOT saying this is good or what I like - specifically, I hate it - but it's how it currently works under US case law. Therefore, to change things, we need Congress to write new laws and/or new Amendments. Our opinions of \"how it should be done\" are irrelevant unless backed by the law. reply kmeisthax 18 hours agorootparentThe funny thing is, when it comes to freedom of speech, the courts made the opposite decision with the State Actors doctrine. If the government wants to censor you, they can't reach through a private institution to do it. But the Third Party Doctrine says they can reach through a private institution to search and seize your property. This is an arbitrary distinction chosen purely by judicial fiat. There was no democratic movement to strengthen 1A and weaken 4A/5A in this manner. Ergo, we shouldn't necessarily have to get Congress involved just to fix this weird inconsistency in caselaw. The courts have an understandable aversion to \"legislating from the bench\", but if you've already done so, I think it's fine to at least fix obvious mistakes. reply bpt3 17 hours agorootparentThere's a major (and important) distinction between the two scenarios. The State Actors doctrine says that the government can't hire someone to do something on their behalf that they're not allowed to do. Under the Third Party Doctrine, they aren't searching and seizing your property in this case, as your data is no longer your property since you gave it to that third party already. If the government was paying Neustar (or whomever) to go acquire this data on their behalf, it would be an issue under current law. But buying something that was handed over willingly* is a different issue. *the article makes a valid point that many people are unaware they have agreed to hand this data over to a service provider, which is something that should be addressed IMO. You might not agree with it, but it's not an \"obvious mistake\" and it's not a \"weird inconsistency\" in caselaw. reply staplers 10 hours agorootparentUnder the Third Party Doctrine, they aren't searching and seizing your property in this case, as your data is no longer your property since you gave it to that third party already. If you have a child in public education, you are forced to use third party tools to communicate, acquire class photos, enroll in sports, etc. Nothing with data collection is \"voluntary\". To exist in our society there are so many \"private institutions\" that essentially wield governmental power. It will absolutely be our undoing as a country that we cannot see the forest from the trees. reply voxic11 18 hours agorootparentprevI don't think the courts or the companies which hold your personal data consider you to have any property right to that data (beyond the intellectual rights you may have via any copyrights, even if you count those much personal data like your location history or your DNA isn't copyrightable). Imo when the government receives a copy of your personal data from a third party they aren't \"taking your property\" any more than I would be if I took a photograph of your house. How do you imagine property rights for personal data to work? Even in places like the EU with stronger rights/protections around personal data they don't try to fit those rights/protections into the existing framework of property rights because they are so different. reply caseysoftware 17 hours agorootparentWe don't have to imagine, we can read their TOS. We continue to \"own\" the data, but we've given them a worldwide irrevocable unlimited license to do what they want, limited only by local law.. hence why I put \"own\" in quotation marks. reply voxic11 17 hours agorootparentWell that is in regard to any copyrighted material you may give them. But for uncopyrightable things like data from a heart rate sensor, or your shopping history on amazon, you can only ever own the physical objects the data is manifested in, not the data itself. And any company will definitely tell you that you have zero property rights over the actual storage devices in the datacenters where your data happens to reside. reply voxic11 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah certain information held by third parties is already protected by statute such as video tape rental or sale records, or emails held by a service provider for less than 180 days.

Which, in my view, is worse than if it were just the government. reply cj 18 hours agorootparentI think there needs to be some kind of \"responsible and clear disclosure\" laws that require companies to very clearly and overtly disclose what data they're collecting and how they're using it. Some kind of standardized \"label\" (something like the standardized nutritional facts on food products) that is easy for consumers to read and comprehend, not buried in pages of paperwork, without needing to read a 20 page TOS / Privacy Policy. The legal problem is everyone is \"consenting\" to data collection by accepting a TOS which protects companies and makes it \"legally acceptable\". The real problem that needs solving is consumers are rarely aware of what they're consenting to. Companies might not hoover up and sell as much data if they were required to clearly tell everyone they're doing it. Basically, let's get rid of this idea that agreeing to a 20 page TOS / Privacy Policy is legally binding whenThe real problem that needs solving is consumers are rarely aware of what they're consenting to. Right, which means consent was never actually given. In order for it to be consent, you have to be fully informed of and understand what you're being asked to consent to, and there has to be a realistic and meaningful way to withhold that consent. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparent> you have to be fully informed of and understand what you're being asked to consent to This really makes it seem like only a very limited set of contracts would actually be legal. To me a big problem we have is that we act as if there is a fair \"fight\" between a mega corporation with a expensive team of lawyers, expert psychologists, and supercomputers against ... my gandma who googles to get to google. I think we all know that nearly no one reads pretty much anything they sign and if they did it is not clear that they are fully informed, understand, or are not under pressure (clear case might be medical consent forms authorizing something like a emergency surgery. I'd find it impossible to convince me the person signing was well informed and not under duress. I'd rather case like that revolve around expert of doctors determining if an action was reasonable to another doctor rather than have anything to do with a patient or surrogate signing a document. Seems to just waste time).

Freely Given Reversible Informed Enthusiastic Specific reply 20after4 16 hours agorootparentprevA TOS is absolutely not a contract that people enter into fully aware of the implications. We should have granular control over the permissions we give companies in how they use data. I don't feel it is enough to require clear disclosure of the ways a company uses data, I think they should require explicit and knowing consent from the user, and the user should have a meaningful way to withhold consent other than to abstain entirely from using any online services. It is hardly fair or equitable, and surely should not be legal that a company can, without any meaningful way for a user to withhold their consent, declare & demand unlimited control and benefit (of/from the user's data) for any purpose whatsoever, including sharing and selling said data for a profit to data brokers who have no contractual obligation to the user once they obtain the data. reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentI'm fully with you, but my question is how you actually inform people at the power of their data? I often pressure people into chatting with me through Signal and I'll be honest, there is often a defeatist or lack of knowledge at what this data can be used for even among graduate CS students. Honestly, I think one of the major issues is that the world is exceptionally complex these days (well, always has been, but surely there's more now). Our entire world runs on specialization but we often act as if one needs to be an expert in nearly every domain. Is not the definition of an expert someone who understands the nuances and complexities of said niche? It would then seem de facto unreasonable for people to have a nuanced understanding of practically any given subject. Because of this, I want to question the common framing about focusing on informing people. I don't want to stop informing people, to be clear. But I think we should look for solutions that are not reliant upon people being informed, as this is clearly not a scalable nor stable mechanism for creatures with finite ̶t̶a̶p̶e̶ ̶ knowledge and finite time. reply Eji1700 18 hours agorootparentprevI honestly don’t think this would work. The number of “well why should I care if they have the data” conversations I’ve had is just depressing. reply cj 18 hours agorootparentWe can't force people to care about privacy.

There is nothing that I’m aware of that says banks or digital service providers need to collect any more information than is necessary to provide the service they offer.

Let's be honest here, how many people are \"clearly informed?\" That's fuzzy definition. I'll give a personal example here[0]. Certainly the implications here are operating through fairly abstract and indirect mechanisms (it's even called \"metadata\") and most people are not trained to operate within these types of frameworks. FWIW, no one seems happy with the situation but feel that they have no choice in the matter. It's said that you can choose not to use said service, but often the implication of that means no phone, no internet, no computer (at least non-linux), no bank, etc. There may be a literal choice available, but not a reasonable choice. I think we need to have a clear distinction between these two, because the literal choice is often used to justify something that would have major impacts. I think it is difficult to argue that one could create a reasonable and relatively average modern life with no access to phone, internet, or computer. It also then clearly becomes \"well I'm forced to share with x people, so I guess I'll share with y\" and often x is \"the government\" (even if it isn't). [0] I've on several occasions had conversations with my family where they've been convinced that their phone is listening to every conversation they have (this dates back to 2010 btw but continues today) because they were served ads for something they were talking to about with a friend, in person. They are convinced that is the only way that such an inference could be made rather than through knowledge that the friend made the purchase (recently), that the companies know these two people are standing right next to one another for an extended period of time, and have a decent knowledge of their interests to infer that this product would be likely discussed by these two people. Ironically the recording is more complex, but it appears simpler.

They understand that the 4th Amendment doesn't offer these protections but made a claim that it does \"in spirit.\" > It is and should continue to be legal for people to tell the government whatever they want. You're right, but that's not what's happening here. What's happening here is one of 2 things. 1) Government initiated: seeks out and requests information from others and in this case, offering payment. 2) Information holder initiated: who is specifically offering information in exchange for compensation. This is more akin to walking into your police station and saying \"I have crimes to report, but I will only do so if you pay me first.\" Obviously this has perverse incentives and I think we can see how this can clearly be abused to circumvent any requirements for warrants or other such due process. I do agree that this situation is in violation of the __spirit__ of our legal system. Clearly a loophole is de facto not in spirit. Whether that is a 4th Amendment or not, idk, IANAL and neither is the OP and I assume neither are you(?). 4th Amendment seems pretty reasonable to point to considering it mentions warrants and this practice is being done explicitly to circumvent warrant requirements. But clearly we all understand what is trying to be communicated here, and that's the point. I wouldn't have made such a comment if you mentioned explicitly third party doctrine (as casey did an hour before you) or cited some law which added clarity to the situation. But yes, everyone knows you can just freely go tell the police about a crime you witnessed. I'm not sure who does not understand this. I would be extremely surprised if anyone actually believed it was illegal to report crimes to authorities and immediately question their mental capacity. But I guess we disagree at what constitutes basic and obvious knowledge. reply kube-system 13 hours agorootparentIt doesn't violate the spirit of the 4th, nor is it a loophole. The 4th is not a prohibition on the government collecting information, nor is it a data privacy law. The 4th is about preventing the government from abusing their power to compel.

This was the case then and it is the case now. > 1) Government initiated: seeks out and requests information from others and in this case, offering payment. 2) Information holder initiated: who is specifically offering information in exchange for compensation. Like a wanted poster and a bounty for information? These existed when the BoR was written. They weren't prohibited by the writers because the writers didn't have an issue with it. The 4th isn't a \"government can't know anything or can't ask anything\" rule, it's a \"government can't bust down your door for no reason\" rule. > I wouldn't have made such a comment if you mentioned explicitly third party doctrine (as casey did an hour before you) or cited some law which added clarity to the situation.

The example I gave was a practical illustration of how silly reality would be if third-party-doctrine wasn't a thing. reply lumb63 10 hours agorootparentI see your point regarding wanted posters and providing bounties for info on criminals. What’s going on with the intelligence agencies buying data from data brokers is definitely similar. However, it seems to me that the scale of what is going on at present is much larger; it is likely akin to having a wanted poster and providing bounties for any info on all people, criminal or otherwise. The vast majority of people whose data is being provided are probably innocent and not suspected of any crimes at all, nor will they ever be. And, as you say, the fourth amendment is a “government can’t bust down your door for no reason” rule. It seems where we differ is that I interpret (as does the U.S. Supreme Court since Katz v. United States) the “bust down your door” part to mean much more than my physical door, which is why I find that it violates the “spirit” of the fourth amendment: in my mind, an amount of privacy that it is reasonable to expect (e.g. what entities a person is communicating with over their own internet connection) is being denied by the government to perhaps all citizens using the Internet. It sounds like we agree that the amount of data being collected on people via the internet is way too much and should be restricted. I think that regardless of whether or not stopping the government and its agencies from purchasing such data is or is not in keeping with the spirit of the fourth amendment, we will need legislation to protect the privacy we want from the government, and definitely from corporations. Let’s work toward that end. reply kube-system 9 hours agorootparent> we will need legislation to protect the privacy we want from the government, and definitely from corporations. Let’s work toward that end. I agree with the latter, but not the former. If you solve the commercial data privacy issue here, the entire problem is solved, because it is the root cause.

But no doubt destroying surveillance capitalism will be a big win for the privacy, security, and safety of the public. From the government, foreign adversaries, and other members of the public alike. But the war will not be won despite victory in a major battle. > We don't need a law that prevents the government from buying records about your internet traffic. You're right. We shouldn't need a law and this will likely come down to a court case that would make explicit the spirit part. As government entities are not allowed to obtain evidence via means that an average citizen would. Which is the entire point. If the gov would need a warrant to collect that data themselves, they need a warrant to elicit that evidence (distinctly different from evidence freely and voluntarily being given to them). Meaning they need a warrant to buy the evidence. > We need a law that prevents companies from selling it to anyone. We need laws to prevent the collection in the first place. reply kube-system 3 hours agorootparent> We need laws to prevent the collection in the first place. Agreed, when possible. But the vast majority of this information is just generated from the activities inherent to doing business and it's always possible to prevent it from being collected at all.

But I think people don't expect or like the idea of that information being shared with third parties who didn't need to be involved. reply godelski 6 hours agorootparentprevThe reason we cannot agree is because you refuse to acknowledge the direction of action. There is a difference if you report to the cops and if the cops come to you and ask you to report. These are completely different. You taking action: okay. Cops taking action: needs due process. Full stop. > The 4th is about preventing the government from abusing their power to compel. Let's get the 4th in here to so we actually read it and not from memory > The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. The 4th is in part about government abusing its power, and that's true for all amendments. But it is clear that the 4th is about protecting information. I do not think it is hard to read as \"The government is not allowed to collect information on people without warrants and without due probable cause.\" It clearly has a legal setting for this given that it is what is cited to prohibit wiretapping[0] and I'll even quote Justice Potter[1] > For the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected. Note that the stress here is on intention to have public and intention to have private. You are protected even if in the public but intending to be private. Surely Potter would believe that were one to walk to a secluded area to hold a phone conversation and the government followed to secretly listen in, that this would be within the protection of the 4th Amendment. Many people incorrectly assume that you cannot have a reasonable expectation of privacy out in public. You sure can and everyone does it. Bathrooms are an uncontestable example. > Like a wanted poster and a bounty for information? The government cannot print wanted posters without due process. Yes, I have no problem with this. The due process part is essential. > The example I gave was a practical illustration of how silly reality would be if third-party-doctrine wasn't a thing. There is a huge difference between someone coming to the government out of their own free will -- someone who is not under duress nor are they incentivized by payment -- than the government making a request. Action is important. The government here is making an explicit action to seek and gather information. Obviously I do not object to someone reporting a crime and I should not need repeat myself any further. There's a reason this is different and you need to stop pigeonholing me into a completely irrelevant argument. Here's how this can be abused. The government (or \"friend\") creates a private corporation. Private corporation does everything that the government cannot do without getting a warrant. Private corporation then gives the information to gov. How is this not a loophole? That's the thing. The government is __seeking__ information that it would normally require a warrant to obtain. Were companies to freely offer this information to the government, then that's a completely different scenario and precisely the one you keep arguing which no one disagrees with. But if the government takes action to elicit that information, (aka ACTION) then that is not the same thing as information volunteered.

The 4th has never prohibited the government from collecting public information, information volunteered by the public, anything they observe in the course of their duties, or literally anything else that isn't compelled. The government has always collected these types of information, both now and at the time that this was written. The writers were aware that police need to collect information in their own investigations, and from other people, to do their job. This is why they specifically wrote what they did, and did not write your rephrasing. > What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection. But what he seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected. Right, phone booths do not have any rights under the 4th. And if Charles Katz is in a phone booth, he expects the conversation to be as private as speaking in a phone booth is. But if Charles Katz gambling partners at the other end of the phone decided to snitch on him, that's legal for them to do, even if Charles Katz didn't want them to. Make no mistake, Justice Potter is definitely not saying \"if you tell someone about a crime, it's illegal for them to snitch\". He's saying that there are situations in public spaces where privacy from direct government surveillance is expected. Phone booths, bathroom stalls, changing rooms, etc. These are public spaces with some expectations of privacy. But there's nowhere, anywhere, that other people are prohibited from talking about you to the police. > The government (or \"friend\") creates a private corporation. Private corporation does everything that the government cannot do without getting a warrant. Private corporation then gives the information to gov. How is this not a loophole? Because the government has a monopoly on the use of force. If people working for a private corporation searched or seized information from others by force, it would be a crime. Data brokers do not use force to obtain their data. There is no search or seizure happening when you volunteer your data to a data broker or their affiliates. reply BobaFloutist 17 hours agoparentprev> It seems to me that the government accessing, even if by purchase, information > of citizens without probable cause is a violation, if not in letter, then in > spirit, of the fourth amendment. On the one hand, I fully agree. On the other hand, I also agree with the intuitive argument that it's very strange to let private corporations surveil and gather, buy, and sell information about citizens to exploit for profit, but then say that the government can't buy that same information for law enforcement and national security. It feels wrong to say that it's fine for someone with only a profit motive to use private data in small, petty ways to extract more profit from someone that's already paid them, but that the duly elected representative government can't use it for big, important things. Or, if law enforcement and national security are too fraught, what about, say, public health policy? The obvious answer is that corporations shouldn't have access to it either, but that's a much harder sell, and so we're in this weird limbo. reply w4 17 hours agorootparent> It feels wrong to say that it's fine for someone with only a profit motive to use private data in small, petty ways to extract more profit from someone that's already paid them, but that the duly elected representative government can't use it for big, important things. We make this distinction all the time in areas like speech and searches, for good reason. The government is the only entity with near-omnipotent power over you. Corporations may be powerful, but they are ultimately restrained by the government’s monopoly on force; the government has no such restraints because it has the monopoly on force. It’s therefore reasonable and prudent to have different, more stringent rules for the government. If someone working for a corporation doesn’t like you, they can’t kill or imprison you (legally).

They do have some DNA that is almost certainly from the criminal but it does not match any DNA they have on file. • Years later they compare that DNA to DNA in some large DNA database that is not focused on criminals. • There are no matches that indicate that the criminal's DNA is in that database, but there are several matches that indicate people who are relatives of the criminal. • They can then look at assorted public records to find people who are related in the right way to some of those relatives. • Among those people, some previous person who either never was a suspect originally or a very weak suspect comes up. They then take a thorough look at any records can find about that person's activities at the times of the crime and find that they were actually connected to most of the victims and in the right places at the right times to be the criminal. • That gives them enough evidence to compel a DNA sample from that person, or they start watching the person and get a DNA sample from something like a discarded napkin or cup that the person unwisely discarded in a public trashcan. That sample matches the samples from the crime scene. • It is that latter sample, and the records of the person's activities and relationships with the victims, that form the bases of the conviction. reply EasyMark 16 hours agorootparentThe point is they absolutely shouldn't have the ability to do blanket searches of DNA banks.

Data collection is required to some degree to, e.g., prosecute criminals. Any agency tasked with law enforcement would use all means at their disposal to do that, and legally purchasing data on the open market does seem reasonable. I agree with you that the Constitution and laws as they are today are unlikely to find any issue with the practices in place. However, my interpretation of the spirit of the fourth amendment is that Americans should not have to tolerate their government (or its agencies) infringing on their privacy unless they are suspected of having done something wrong, which is why the purchase of data from data brokers seems wrong to me. Personally, I would deem such means permissible to investigate someone suspected of having committed a crime. Where I find issue is the widespread use of such techniques to monitor for crimes, since they come at such a large cost to personal privacy, and are searching for a needle in a haystack. Millions will have their privacy compromised so that maybe a single criminal can be caught, and personally, that cost is too high. I understand some folks might disagree that, but I hope Sen. Wyden, and others who join forces with him or follow him, will continue to represent that idea, and pursue legislation to codify it in law. reply tootie 18 hours agoparentprevI doubt it. The data collected by brokers is going to all be indemnified by whoever collected the data.

Geolocation can link an IP address to a region as imprecise to a country to a more precise region such as a city. Combining rough location to a few other data points can greatly narrow down meatspace candidates for a particular account [1]: > According to one landmark study, these three characteristics are enough to uniquely identify 87% of the U.S. population. A different study showed that 63% of the U.S. population can be uniquely identified from these three facts.

If a website happens to collect gender or birthday, then the website might share/sell the info to data brokers.

The US State department Exchange Online hack is an example of where \"NetFlow\" being purchased could be more interesting as an example. IP addresses such as those registered in Russia and to OVH data centres logging into State Department executive mailboxes at 3:00AM in US time zones should be laughably easy to detect.[4] Rented US virtual servers and AWS/Azure/GCP servers outside federal government availability zones would also be trivial to detect as suspicious source locations. The question that purchased \"NetFlow\" would help answer is what is connecting to those suspicious IP addresses, what is connected to those, what else do the chain of IP addresses found communicate with, etc.[5] - Worst case there was no one was watching that attack as it occurred over ~4 months through use of \"NetFlow\" that may have been available and useful to use. - Controversial case is someone was watching (possibly including attacker's use, if any, of US servers) and decided that it was better to keep watching and following the attackers than to immediately prevent a few State Department emails being leaked. - Best case (not implemented) would seemingly be to fix terribly configured government systems so they can only be accessed from trusted locations and not random rented virtual server IPs, and \"NetFlow\" analysis is then probably not required. Security features such as \"We've noticed your account is accessing this system from a new ISP--confirm this is really you?\" aren't new.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu",
    "originBody": "Quickemu Quickly create and run optimised Windows, macOS and Linux desktop virtual machines. Made with 💝 for Introduction Quickly create and run highly optimised desktop virtual machines for Linux, macOS and Windows; with just two commands. You decide what operating system you want to run and Quickemu will figure out the best way to do it for you. For example: quickget ubuntu-mate 22.04 quickemu --vm ubuntu-mate-22.04.conf The original objective of the project was to enable quick testing of Linux distributions where the virtual machine configurations can be stored anywhere, such as external USB storage or your home directory, and no elevated permissions are required to run the virtual machines. Quickemu now also includes comprehensive support for macOS and Windows. Features macOS Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave & High Sierra Windows 10 and 11 including TPM 2.0 Ubuntu and all the official Ubuntu flavours Over 360 operating system editions are supported! Full SPICE support including host/guest clipboard sharing VirtIO-webdavd file sharing for Linux and Windows guests VirtIO-9p file sharing for Linux and macOS guests QEMU Guest Agent support; provides access to a system-level agent via standard QMP commands Samba file sharing for Linux, macOS and Windows guests (if smbd is installed on the host) VirGL acceleration USB device pass-through Smartcard pass-through Automatic SSH port forwarding to guests Network port forwarding Full duplex audio Braille support EFI (with or without SecureBoot) and Legacy BIOS boot Graphical user interfaces available Quickemu is a wrapper for the excellent QEMU that attempts to automatically \"do the right thing\", rather than expose exhaustive configuration options. We have a Discord for this project: See this (old) video where I explain some of my motivations for creating Quickemu. Requirements QEMU (6.0.0 or newer) with GTK, SDL, SPICE & VirtFS support bash (4.0 or newer) Coreutils EDK II grep jq LSB procps python3 macrecovery mkisofs usbutils util-linux sed socat spicy swtpm Wget xdg-user-dirs xrandr zsync unzip Installing Requirements For Ubuntu, Arch and nixos systems the ppa, AUR or nix packaging will take care of the dependencies. For other host distributions or operating systems it will be necessary to install the above requirements or their equivalents. These examples may save a little typing Debian (and direct derivatives such as MX Linux): sudo apt install qemu bash coreutils ovmf grep jq lsb-base procps python3 genisoimage usbutils util-linux sed spice-client-gtk libtss2-tcti-swtpm0 wget xdg-user-dirs zsync unzip Fedora: sudo dnf install qemu bash coreutils edk2-tools grep jq lsb procps python3 genisoimage usbutils util-linux sed spice-gtk-tools swtpm wget xdg-user-dirs xrandr unzip MacOS: This is a work in progress (see issue 248 for other steps and changes that may enable running on MacOS) brew install qemu bash coreutils grep jq python@3.10 cdrtools gnu-sed spice-gtk wget zsync Usage Graphical User Interfaces While quickemu and quickget are designed for the terminal, a graphical user interface is also available: Quickgui by Mark Johnson and Yannick Mauray. Many thanks to Luke Wesley-Holley and Philipp Kiemle for creating the Quickemu icons 🎨 Quickgui for Ubuntu sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannick-mauray/quickgui sudo apt update sudo apt install quickgui quickemu quickget X terminal project From Nov 2023, there is also a multi option desktop integrated text interface, with lots of unique tools and utilities to help you make light work of installations, snapshots and disk management qqX is independently curated by Alex Genovese (see the github pages) Install Quickemu Arch Quickemu is available from the AUR (Arch user repository), and can be installed via any AUR helper. Assuming your AUR helper is yay, Run the following command: yay -Sy quickemu Ubuntu Quickemu is available from a PPA for Ubuntu users. The Quickemu PPA also includes a back port of QEMU 6.0.0 for 20.04 (Focal) and 21.04 (Hirsute). To install Quickemu and all the dependencies run the following in a terminal: sudo apt-add-repository ppa:flexiondotorg/quickemu sudo apt update sudo apt install quickemu Other Linux git clone --filter=blob:none https://github.com/wimpysworld/quickemu cd quickemu Now install all the Requirements documented above.

Post-install: Install the SPICE agent (spice-vdagent) in the guest to enable copy/paste and USB redirection. Install the SPICE WebDAV agent (spice-webdavd) in the guest to enable file sharing. macOS Guest quickget automatically downloads a macOS recovery image and creates a virtual machine configuration. quickget macos catalina quickemu --vm macos-catalina.conf macOS high-sierra, mojave, catalina, big-sur, monterey and ventura are supported. Use cursor keys and enter key to select the macOS Base System From macOS Utilities Click Disk Utility and Continue Select QEMU HARDDISK Media (~103.08GB) from the list (on Big Sur and above use Apple Inc. VirtIO Block Device) and click Erase. Enter a Name: for the disk If you are installing macOS Mojave or later (Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey and Ventura), choose any of the APFS options as the filesystem. MacOS Extended may not work. Click Erase. Click Done. Close Disk Utility From macOS Utilities Click Reinstall macOS and Continue Complete the installation as you normally would. On the first reboot use cursor keys and enter key to select macOS Installer On the subsequent reboots use cursor keys and enter key to select the disk you named Once you have finished installing macOS you will be presented with an the out-of-the-box first-start wizard to configure various options and set up your username and password OPTIONAL: After you have concluded the out-of-the-box wizard, you may want to enable the TRIM feature that the computer industry created for SSD disks. This feature in our macOS installation will allow QuickEmu to compact (shrink) your macOS disk image whenever you delete files inside the Virtual Machine. Without this step your macOS disk image will only ever get larger and will not shrink even when you delete lots of data inside macOS. To enable TRIM, open the Terminal application and type the following command followed by pressing command on the hard disk when files are deleted: sudo trimforce enable You will be prompted to enter your account's password to gain the privilege needed. Once you've entered your password and pressed in the form of two questions that require you to type response as though you said \"no\": IMPORTANT NOTICE: This tool force-enables TRIM for all relevant attached devices, even though such devices may not have been validated for data integrity while using TRIM. Use of this tool to enable TRIM may result in unintended data loss or data corruption. It should not be used in a commercial operating environment or with important data. Before using this tool, you should back up all of your data and regularly back up data while TRIM is enabled. This tool is provided on an \"as is\" basis. APPLE MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THIS TOOL OR ITS USE ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH YOUR DEVICES, SYSTEMS, OR SERVICES. BY USING THIS TOOL TO ENABLE TRIM, YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE TOOL IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. Are you sure you with to proceed (y/N)? And a second confirmation once you've confirmed the previous one: Your system will immediately reboot when this is complete. Is this OK (y/N)? As the last message states, your system will automatically reboot as soon as the command completes. The default macOS configuration looks like this: guest_os=\"macos\" img=\"macos-catalina/RecoveryImage.img\" disk_img=\"macos-catalina/disk.qcow2\" macos_release=\"catalina\" guest_os=\"macos\" instructs Quickemu to optimise for macOS. macos_release=\"catalina\" instructs Quickemu to optimise for a particular macOS release. For example VirtIO Network and Memory Ballooning are available in Big Sur and newer, but not previous releases. And VirtIO Block Media (disks) are supported/stable in Catalina and newer. macOS compatibility There are some considerations when running macOS via Quickemu. Supported macOS releases: High Sierra Mojave Catalina (Recommended) Big Sur Monterey Ventura quickemu will automatically download the required OpenCore bootloader and OVMF firmware from OSX-KVM. Optimised by default, but no GPU acceleration is available. Host CPU vendor is detected and guest CPU is optimised accordingly. VirtIO Block Media is used for the system disk where supported. VirtIO usb-tablet is used for the mouse. VirtIO Network (virtio-net) is supported and enabled on macOS Big Sur and newer but previous releases use vmxnet3. VirtIO Memory Ballooning is supported and enabled on macOS Big Sur and newer but disabled for other support macOS releases. USB host and SPICE pass-through is: UHCI (USB 2.0) on macOS Catalina and earlier. XHCI (USB 3.0) on macOS Big Sur and newer. Display resolution can only be changed via macOS System Preferences. Full Duplex audio requires VoodooHDA OC or pass-through a USB audio-device to the macOS guest VM. NOTE! Gatekeeper and System Integrity Protection (SIP) need to be disabled to install VoodooHDA OC File sharing between guest and host is available via virtio-9p and SPICE webdavd. Copy/paste via SPICE agent is not available on macOS. macOS App Store If you see \"Your device or computer could not be verified\" when you try to login to the App Store, make sure that your wired ethernet device is en0. Use ifconfig in a terminal to verify this. If the wired ethernet device is not en0, then then go to System Preferences -> Network, delete all the network devices and apply the changes. Next, open a terminal and run the following: sudo rm /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist Now reboot, and the App Store should work. Windows 8, 10 & 11 Guests quickget can download Windows10 and Windows 11 automatically and create an optimised virtual machine configuration. This configuration also includes the VirtIO drivers for Windows. Windows 8.1 is also supported but doesn't feature any automated installation or driver optimisation. quickget windows 11 quickemu --vm windows-11.conf Complete the installation as you normally would. All relevant drivers and services should be installed automatically. A local administrator user account is automatically created, with these credentials: Username: Quickemu Password: quickemu The default Windows 11 configuration looks like this: guest_os=\"windows\" disk_img=\"windows-11/disk.qcow2\" iso=\"windows-11/windows-11.iso\" fixed_iso=\"windows-11/virtio-win.iso\" tpm=\"on\" secureboot=\"off\" guest_os=\"windows\" instructs quickemu to optimise for Windows. fixed_iso= specifies the ISO image that provides VirtIO drivers. tpm=\"on\" instructs quickemu to create a software emulated TPM device using swtpm. SPICE The following features are available while using the SPICE protocol: Copy/paste between the guest and host Host file sharing to the guest USB device redirection To use SPICE add --display spice to the Quickemu invocation, this requires that the spicy client is installed, available from the spice-client-gtk package in Debian/Ubuntu. quickemu --vm ubuntu-22.04.conf --display spice To enable copy/paste with a Windows guest, install SPICE Windows guest tools in the guest VM. Headless To start a VM with SPICE enabled, but no display attached use --display none. This requires that the spicy client is installed, available from the spice-client-gtk package in Debian/Ubuntu to connect to the running VM quickemu --vm ubuntu-22.04.conf --display none You can also use the .ports file in the VM directory to lookup what SSH and SPICE ports the VM is connected to. cat ubuntu-22.04/ubuntu-22.04.ports If, for example, the SSH port is set to 22220, and assuming your VM has a started SSH service (details vary by OS), you can typically SSH into it from the host as follows: ssh -p 22220 your_vm_user@localhost Accessibility Qemu provides support for using BrlAPI to display braille output on a real or fake device. quickemu --vm ubuntu-22.04.conf --braille --display sdl BIOS and EFI Since Quickemu 2.1.0 efi is the default boot option. If you want to override this behaviour then add the following line to you VM configuration to enable legacy BIOS. boot=\"legacy\" - Enable Legacy BIOS boot Tuning CPU cores, RAM & disks By default, Quickemu will calculate the number of CPUs cores and RAM to allocate to a VM based on the specifications of your host computer. You can override this default behaviour and tune the VM configuration to your liking. Add additional lines to your virtual machine configuration: cpu_cores=\"4\" - Specify the number of CPU cores allocated to the VM ram=\"4G\" - Specify the amount of RAM to allocate to the VM disk_size=\"16G\" - Specify the size of the virtual disk allocated to the VM Disk preallocation Preallocation mode (allowed values: off (default), metadata, falloc, full). An image with preallocated metadata is initially larger but can improve performance when the image needs to grow. Specify what disk preallocation should be used, if any, when creating the system disk image by adding a line like this to your VM configuration. preallocation=\"metadata\" CD-ROM disks If you want to expose an ISO image from the host to guest add the following line to the VM configuration: fixed_iso=\"/path/to/image.iso\" Floppy disks If you're like Alan Pope you'll probably want to mount a floppy disk image in the guest. To do so add the following line to the VM configuration: floppy=\"/path/to/floppy.img\" File Sharing All File Sharing options will only expose ~/Public (or localised variations) for the current user to the guest VMs. Samba 🐧 🍏 🪟 If smbd is available on the host, Quickemu will automatically enable the built-in QEMU support for exposing a Samba share from the host to the guest. You can install the minimal Samba components on Ubuntu using: sudo apt install --no-install-recommends samba If everything is set up correctly, the smbd address will be printed when the virtual machine is started. For example: - smbd: On guest: smb://10.0.2.4/qemu If using a Windows guest, right-click on \"This PC\", click \"Add a network location\", and paste this address, removing smb: and replacing forward slashes with backslashes (in this example \\\\10.0.2.4\\qemu). SPICE WebDAV 🐧 🪟 TBD VirtIO-9P 🐧 🍏 TBD Network port forwarding Add an additional line to your virtual machine configuration. For example: port_forwards=(\"8123:8123\" \"8888:80\") In the example above: Port 8123 on the host is forwarded to port 8123 on the guest. Port 8888 on the host is forwarded to port 80 on the guest. Disable networking To completely disable all network interfaces in a guest VM add this additional line to your virtual machine configuration: network=\"none\" Restricted networking You can isolate the guest from the host (and broader network) using the restrict option, which will restrict networking to just the guest and any virtual devices. This can be used to prevent software running inside the guest from phoning home while still providing a network inside the guest. Add this additional line to your virtual machine configuration: network=\"restrict\" Bridged networking Connect your virtual machine to a preconfigured network bridge. Add an additional line to your virtual machine configuration: network=\"br0\" If you want to have a persistent MAC address for your bridged network interface in the guest VM you can add macaddr to the virtual machine configuration. QEMU requires that the MAC address is in the range: 52:54:00:AB:00:00 - 52:54:00:AB:FF:FF So you can generate your own MAC addresses with: macaddr=\"52:54:00:AB:51:AE\" USB redirection Quickemu supports USB redirection via SPICE pass-through and host pass-through. SPICE redirection (recommended) Using SPICE for USB pass-through is easiest as it doesn't require any elevated permission, start Quickemu with --display spice and then select Input -> Select USB Device for redirection from the menu to choose which device(s) you want to attach to the guest. Host redirection NOT Recommended USB host redirection is not recommended, it is provided purely for backwards compatibility to older versions of Quickemu. Using SPICE is preferred, see above. Add an additional line to your virtual machine configuration.

Here is an example of how to create a shortcut. quickemu --vm ubuntu-22.04-desktop.conf --shortcut Screen and window size (Linux guests only) qemu will always default to the primary monitor to display the VM's window. Without the --screen option, quickemu will look for the size of the smallest monitor, and use a size that fits on said monitor. The --screen option forces quickemu to use the size of the given monitor to compute the size of the window. It won't use that monitor to display the VM's window if it's not the primary monitor. This is useful if the primary monitor if not the smallest one, and if the VM's window doesn't need to be moved around. The --screen option is also useful with the --fullscreen option, again because qemu will always use the primary monitor. In order for the fullscreen mode to work properly, the resolution of the VM's window must match the resolution of the screen. To know which screen to use, type: xrandr --listmonitorsgrep -v Monitors The command will output something like this: 0: +*HDMI-0 2560/597x1440/336+1920+0 HDMI-0 1: +DVI-D-0 1920/527x1080/296+0+0 DVI-D-0 The first number is what needs to be passed to the --screen option. For example: quickemu --vm vm.conf --screen 0 The above uses the 2560x1440 screen to compute the size of the window, which Quickemu sizes to 2048x1152. Without the --screen option, Quickemu would have used the 1920x1080 monitor which results in a window size of 1664x936. The '--screenpct' is an optional integer value between 25 <= pct < 100 which will override system default screen sizes. The VM size will be 'pct' of the chosen screen. If --fullscreen is chosen screen will be fullsize instead of being scaled down by --screenpct value. References Useful reference that assisted the development of Quickemu.

I used to use this all the time for managing bunches of disparate vm hosts and local vms. reply freedomben 19 hours agoparentvirt-manager is one of the most underrated softwares there is. It's a powerhouse and I use it all the time. It is going to expect you to know some basic terminology about VMs, but it reminds me a lot of the old skool GUIs that were packed with features and power. If your needs are simple or you're less technical with the VMs, Gnome Boxes uses the same backend and has a beautiful streamlined GUI. With the simplicity of course comes less flexibility, but cool thing is you can actually open Gnome Boxes VMs with virt-manager should you later need to tweak a setting that isn't exposed through Boxes. reply buffet_overflow 19 hours agorootparentI’m so appreciative that virt-manager has a GUI that crafts and then lets you edit the XML directly. It really eased that beginner into competent stages of using the program for me. reply beebeepka 15 hours agorootparentAgreed, it's much better than nothing, though I still don't know how to port forward. reply blcknight 18 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely love virt-manager. I try gnome-boxes every so often and it just doesn’t compare.

Run it on a remote system via ssh, and it will \"X-Forward\" the Qemu console on my local Wayland session in Fedora. First time I ran it, thinking I was doing a headless mode, and it popped up a window, was quite surprising. :) reply stracer 13 hours agoparentprevLibvirt and virt-manager are just simplified user interface to the real software, which is qemu(and KVM). They solve pretty trivial problems, like parsing config file and passing the right options to the qemu binary. Yes, they have some additional useful administration features like start/stop based on a config file, serial console access, but these are really simple to implement in your own shell scripts. Storage handling in libvirt is horrible, verbose, complex, yet it can't even work with thin LVs or ZFS properly. Unless you just want to run stuff the standard corporate way and do not care about learning fundamental software like qemu and shell, or require some obscure feature of libvirt, I recommend using qemu on KVM directly, using your own scripts. You'll learn more about qemu and less about underwhelming Python wrappers, and you'll have more control on your systems. Also, IBM/Red Hat seems to have deprecated virt-manager in favour (of course) a new web interface (Copilot). Quickemu seems to be of more interest, as it allows launching new VM right after a quick look at examples, without time wasting on learning a big complicated UI. reply anthk 7 minutes agorootparentLibvirt can dump configs as scripts. If virsh/virt-manager does the 90% of the tedious work with a fine UI in order to be replicated later, I guess libvirt wins here. reply o11c 11 hours agorootparentprevThe real advantage to libvirt is that it also works with things other than qemu. reply gamepsys 11 hours agorootparentprev> Quickemu seems to be of more interest, as it allows launching new VM right after a quick look at examples, without time wasting on learning a big complicated UI.

Imagine what life would be like if configuration was separated from the software it configures. You could choose your favorite configuration manager, and use that, rather than learn how each and every program with a UI reinvented the wheel. The closest thing we have are text configuration files. Every program that uses them has to choose a specific language, and a specific place to save its configs. An idea I've been playing with a lot lately is a configuration intermediary. Use whatever language/format you want for the user-facing config UI, and use that data as a single source of truth to generate the software-facing config files. reply 3np 15 hours agorootparentYou have some incumbent competition already, in case you're not aware, and I'd say many of these are closer to what you're describing than text configuration files. You would do well to learn by past and current attempts. This book should be enlightenig (and yes, Elektra is very much alive): https://www.libelektra.org/ftp/elektra/publications/raab2017... Would also be a useful excercice to write a new configuration UI for existing configuration backend(s) (preferably something already in use by some software you're already in want of better configuration for) - even if you do end up aiming at your own standard (xkcd.com/927), it should give you some clarity on ways to approach it. reply thomastjeffery 12 hours agorootparentThe irony here is that the problem you have proposed - the complexity introduced by creating a new solution - is the same problem that each solution is intended to solve. That means that any adequate solution should recursively resolve the problem it introduces. oh, and also thank you for introducing me to Elektra. That was very helpful of you. reply acatton 22 hours agoprevJust a security reminder from the last time this got posted[1] This tool downloads random files from the internet, and check their checksum against other random files from the internet. [2] This is not the best security practice. (The right security practice would be to have the gpg keys of the distro developers committed in the repository, and checking all files against these keys) This is not downplaying the effort which was put in this project to find the correct flags to pass to QEMU to boot all of these.

While GPG key verification would be the best way to ensure authenticity, it's doing nothing different from what almost everyone does: download the ISO from the distro's own HTTPS site. It then goes beyond what most people do and validates that the hashes matche. reply JeremyNT 19 hours agorootparentIMO you're exactly right. I just looked at the shell script and it's not \"random\" at all, it's getting both the checksum and the ISO from the official source over TLS. The only way this technique is going to fail is if the distro site is compromised, their DNS lapses, or if there's a MITM attack combined with an incorrectly issued certificate. GPG would be more robust but it's hardly like what this tool is doing is some unforgivable failure either. It's not that the OP is wrong but I think they give a really dire view of what's happening here. reply npteljes 16 hours agorootparentprevGetting the signature and the file from the same place is questionable practice in itself. If the place is hacked, then all the hacker needs to do is to just hash his own file, which has happened in at least one high profile case [0]. And this practice doesn't even offer any extra protection if the resource was accessed with HTTPS in the first place. [0] https://www.zdnet.com/article/hacker-hundreds-were-tricked-i... reply funcDropShadow 1 hour agorootparentprev> It then goes beyond what most people do and validates that the hashes matche. It might go above and beyond what most people are doing, but not what most tools are doing. Old school package managers are still a step ahead in this area, because they use GPG to check the authenticity of the data files, independent of the transportation channel. A website to download files and checksums is one such channel. This enables supporting multiple transportation channels, then it was a mirror of ftp mirrors. Today, it might be bittorent or ipfs or a CDN. And GPG supports revoking the trust. Checksums that are hardcoded into a tool cannot be revoked. As soon as we start to codify practices into tools, they become easier to game and attack. Therefore tools should be held to higher security standards than humans. reply repelsteeltje 21 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely true, but one additional factor (or vector) is that this adds a level of indirection. That is, you're trusting the Quickemu people to take the same diligence you yourself would do when downloading an ISO from, say ubuntu.com for each and every target I can conveniently install with Quickemu. It's a subtle difference, but the trust-chain could indeed be (mildly) improved by re-distributing the upstream gpg keys. reply Joker_vD 20 hours agorootparentEh, you can fetch the GPG keys from some GPG keyserver, it's not like those keys are just random files from the Internet. They're cross-signed, after all! reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparentHow do you know which keys to get? Let me guess... you read their website. reply st3fan 20 hours agorootparentprevBecause you wrote HTTPS in italic .. HTTPS doesn't mean anything. Both the good and bad actors can have perfectly valid HTTPS configured. It is not a good indicator of trustworthiness of the actual thing you download. reply hn_throwaway_99 19 hours agorootparent> HTTPS doesn't mean anything. That's not accurate at all. HTTPS should mean \"we've validated that the content you're receiving comes from the registered domain that you've hit\". Yes, it's possible that the domain host itself was compromised, or that the domain owner himself is malicious, but at the end of the day you have to trust the entity you're getting the content from. HTTPS says, importantly, \"You're getting the content from whom you think you're getting it from.\" reply funcDropShadow 1 hour agorootparentBut by using GPG to check the authenticity of the actual files that are downloaded, we can remove the web site -- whether https is sufficienctly secure or not -- from the trust chain all together. The shorter the trust chain, the better. reply st3fan 18 hours agorootparentprevYes but we abandoned that idea a while ago. There are no more green locks in browsers. Nobody buys those expensive certificates that proof ownership. When you curl something it doesn't show anything unless it is an actual invalid certificate. You are correct that it _should mean_ but reality today is that it doesn't mean anything. reply yjftsjthsd-h 15 hours agorootparentNo, it still means that you've connected to the domain that you wanted to connect to and the connection is reasonably resistant to MITM attacks. It doesn't say anything about who controls the domain, but what it provides still isn't nothing. reply st3fan 6 hours agorootparentIt is not about the domain. \"It is not a good indicator of trustworthiness of the actual thing you download.\" I just downloaded something with malware from github.com. I indeed wanted to connect to github.com and I trust that it is Github.com. But again ... it did not say _anything_ about the trustworthyness of the _actual_ thing I did, which was to download an asset from that domain. That is my point. In the context of this discussion about downloading dependencies. reply electroly 18 hours agorootparentprev> HTTPS says, importantly, \"You're getting the content from whom you think you're getting it from.\" You need certificate pinning to know this for sure, due to the existence of MITM HTTPS spoofing in things like corporate firewalls. HTTPS alone isn't enough; you have to confirm the certificate is the one you expected. (You can pin the CA cert rather than the leaf certificate if you want, if you trust the CA; that still prevents MITM spoofing.) reply brirec 18 hours agorootparentI’m not aware of any HTTPS MITM that can function properly without adding its own certificate to the trusted roots on your system (or dismissing a big red warning for every site), so I don’t think certificate pinning is necessary in such an environment (if the concern is MITM by a corporate firewall). An attacker would still need to either have attacked the domain in question, or be able to forge arbitrary trusted certificates. reply yjftsjthsd-h 18 hours agorootparentprevIf an attack requires compromising my operating system certificate store, I'm reasonably comfortable excluding it from most of my threat models. reply electroly 15 hours agorootparentObviously you choose your own relevant threat models, but it's common to do in iOS apps--many apps are including it in their threat models. Pinning the CA cert is what Apple recommends to app developers. It's not an unreasonable thing to do. https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9ejcf8y reply yjftsjthsd-h 15 hours agorootparentThat link discusses how to do it but not why. The most likely thing that occurs to me is that iOS apps consider the user a potentially hostile actor in their threat model, which is... technically a valid model, but in the context of this thread I don't that counts as a real concern. reply EasyMark 19 hours agorootparentprevTrust is an input into any security equation. Do you trust all sources of these files? I don't think anyone was challenging gpg reply jvanderbot 20 hours agoparentprevHow much of this is outdated practice? Shouldn't TCP/TLS be doing checksum and origin signing already? In the days of FTP, checksum and gpg were vital. With http/TCP, you need more GPG due to TCP handling retries checksum etc, but still both due to MitM. But with https, how does it still matter? It's doing both verifications and signature checks for you. reply acatton 19 hours agorootparentTLS prevents a different kind of attack, the MitM one which you describe. GPG signing covers this threat model but much more, the threats include: * The server runs vulnerable software and is compromised by script-kiddies. They, then, upload arbitrary packages on the server * The cloud provider is compromised and attackers take over the server from the admin cloud provider account. * Attacker use a vulnerability (from SSH, HTTPd, ...) to upload arbitrary software packages to the server GPG doesn't protect against the developer machine getting compromised, but it guarantees that what you're downloading has been issued from the developer's machine. reply jvanderbot 18 hours agorootparentI agree, but I think that model of GPG is not how it's used any more. I think nowadays people upload a one-shot CI key, which is used to sign builds. So you're basically saying \"The usual machine built this\". Which is good information, don't get me wrong, but it's much less secure than \"John was logged into his laptop and entered the password for the key that signed this\" So, you're right, that GPG verifies source, whereas TLS verifies distribution. I suppose those can be very different things. Perhaps counter example: https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-ci/+archive/ubuntu/stable-bac... > The packages here are from the latest upstream release with WORK IN PROGRESS packaging, built from our repositories on Phabricator. These are going to be manually uploaded to the Backports PPA once they are considered stable.

Manual or automatic? reply spookie 12 hours agorootparentOne shot CI keys. I guess I shouldn't have used that term, it certainly is more work that doing otherwise. Nevertheless, their advantages offer nothing of value in this context. At least, I think so. Correct me if I'm wrong. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparentprev> They then upload arbitrary packages on the server And change the instructions to point to a different GPG key (or none at all).

[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mtQyEd-zS4 reply hnfong 20 hours agorootparentprevI believe GP implicitly assumes that bash (and generally POSIX-y shell script) has lots of quirks and footguns (to which I generally agree). After skimming through the source code though, I'd say the concerns are probably overstated. reply jstrieb 18 hours agoparentprevWhile I agree in general that shell script is not usually fun to read, this particular code is really not bad. Not sure if this will sway you, but for what it's worth, I did read the bash script before running it, and it's actually very well-structured. Functionality is nicely broken into functions, variables are sensibly named, there are some helpful comments, there is no crazy control flow or indirection, and there is minimal use of esoteric commands. Overall this repo contains some of the most readable shell scripts I've seen. Reflecting on what these scripts actually do, it makes sense that the code is fairly straightforward. At its core it really just wants to run one command: the one to start QEMU. All of the other code is checking out the local system for whether to set certain arguments to that one command, and maybe downloading some files if necessary. reply arghwhat 17 hours agorootparentI do see that it is better structured, but as any other bash script it relies heavily on global variables. For example, `--delete-vm` is effectively `rm -rf $(dirname ${disk_img})`, but the function takes no arguments. It's getting the folder name from the global variable `$VMDIR`, which is set by the handling of the `--vm` option (another global variable named $VM) to `$(dirname ${disk_img})`, which in turn relies on sourcing a script named `$VM`. First, when it works, it'll `rm -rf` the parent path of the VMs disk_img variable is set to, irrespective of whether it exists or is valid as dirname doesn't check that - it just tries to snip the end of the string. Enter an arbitrary string, and you'll `rm -rf` your current working directory as `dirname` just return \".\". Second, it does not handle relative paths. If you you pass `--vm somedir/name` with `disk_img` just set to the relative file name, it will not resolve`$VMDIR` relative to \"somedir\"- `dirname` will return \".\", resulting in your current working directory being wiped rather than the VM directory. Third, you're relying on the flow of global variables across several code paths in a huge bash script, not to mention global variables from a sourced bash script that could accidentally mess up quickemu's state, to protect you against even more broken rm -rf behavior. This is fragile and easily messed up by future changes. The core functionality of just piecing together a qemu instantiation is an entirely fine and safe use of bash, and the script is well-organized for a bash script... But all the extra functionality makes this convoluted, fragile, and one bug away from rm -rf'ing your home folder. reply keyringlight 21 hours agoparentprevI'd say this is a general issue with software, most generally how and what you do to establish trust, what expectations/responsibilities there are of a developer and user. The \"many eyes make all bugs shallow\" phrase does seem to be a little bit of a thought terminating cliché for some users, if it's open to scrutiny then it must be fine, conjuring an image of roaming packs of code auditors to inspect everything (I'd expect them more on the malicious side rather than benevolent) Over for windows, there's been a constant presence of tweak utilities for decades that attract people trying to get everything out of their system on the assumption that 'big corp' developers don't have the motivation to do so and leave easy options on the table behind quick config or registry tweaks that are universally useful. One that comes to mind which I see occasionally is TronScript which if I had to bet on it passes the 'sniff test' with its history and participation I'd say it's good, but presents itself as automation, abstracting away the details and hoping they make good decisions on your behalf. While you could dig into it and research/educate yourself on what is happening and why, for many it might as well be a binary. I think only saving grace for this is that most of these tools have a limited audience, so they're not worth compromising. When one brand does become used often enough you may get situations like CCleaner from piriform that was backdoored in 2017. reply wjdp 20 hours agorootparentGoogled that, found the GitHub with aof > DO NOT DOWNLOAD TRON FROM GITHUB, IT WILL NOT WORK!!

A prompt could be: \"You are a linux guru, and you have extensive experience with bash and all forms of unix/linux. I am going to be pasting a large amount of code in a little bit at a time. Every time I paste code and send it to you, you are going to add it to the previous code and ask me if I am done. When I am done we are going to talk about the code, and you are going to help me break it down and understand what is going on. If you understand you will ask me to start sending code, otherwise ask me any questions before you ask for the code.\" I have used this method before for some shorter code (sub 1000 lines, but still longer than the prompt allows) and it works pretty well. I will admit that ChatGPT has been lazy of late, and sometimes I have to specifically tell it not to be lazy and give me the full output I am asking for, but overall it does a pretty decent job of explaining code to me. reply yoyoinbog 22 hours agoprevLooks interesting but would someone be so kind to point out if there are any advantages for a guy like me who just runs win 11 in VirtualBox under Ubuntu from time to time? reply kxrm 22 hours agoparentHard to answer this question as it largely depends on what you are doing with your VM.

You do `docker create --name ubuntu ubuntu:22.04` and then `docker export ubuntu` to create a tar from an arbitrary docker image. Then you extract that to `/var/lib/machines/ubuntu`. Make sure to choose an image with systemd or install systemd in the container. Finally do `machinectl start ubuntu` and `machinectl shell ubuntu` to get inside. systemd-nspawn is very simple and lightweight and emulates a real Linux machine very well. You can take an arbitrary root partition based on systemd and boot it using systemd-nspawn and it will just work. reply tarruda 19 hours agorootparentsystemd-nspawn is simple but AFAIK it doesn't do any security other than the kernel namespacing. Docker is even worse because it runs containers as root, which means a rogue process can take over the host very easily. Incus/LXD runs containers as normal users (by default) and also confines the whole namespace in apparmor to further isolate containerized processes from the host. Apparmor confinement is also used for VMs (the qemu process cannot access anything that is not defined in the whitelist) reply viraptor 19 hours agorootparentDocker runs container as the user you tell it to.

By Nilay Patel, editor-in-chief of the Verge, host of the Decoder podcast, and co-host of The Vergecast. Jan 30, 2024, 2:00 PM UTC| Share this story If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. There’s a lot of pressure on the new Apple Vision Pro, Apple’s long-awaited entry into the world of computers you wear on your face. Apple claims that the Vision Pro, which starts at $3,499, is the beginning of something called “spatial computing,” which basically boils down to running apps all around you. And the company’s ads for it do not hedge that pressure even a little: they show people wearing the Vision Pro all the time. At work! Doing laundry! Playing with their kids! The ambition is enormous: to layer apps and information over the real world — to augment reality. Apple has to claim that the Vision Pro is the beginning of something new because people have been building headset computers for over a decade now. I tried on a development prototype of the first Oculus Rift in 2013, and The Verge’s Adi Robertson, who edited this review, has tried basically every headset that’s been released since. All of that development means there are some pretty good products out there: that first Oculus evolved into the Quest line at Meta, which is now shipping the Quest 3 — a very good VR headset with a huge library of games and some AR features of its own, which costs $500. 7Verge Score Apple Vision Pro $3499 The Good Display is a technical marvel with the best video passthrough yet Hand and eye tracking are a leap forward Works seamlessly with Apple’s ecosystem Fun to put windows all over space The Bad Very expensive Video passthrough is still video passthrough and can be blurry Hand and eye tracking can be inconsistent and frustrating Personas are uncanny and somewhat terrifying It’s pretty lonely in there $3499 at Apple How we rate and review products In the meantime, Apple, from Tim Cook on down, has largely insisted that augmented reality will be much more valuable than virtual reality. And it’s been building toward AR for a long time: developers have access to AR tools in iOS, and higher-end iPhones and iPads have had lidar depth scanners for a few years now. The Vision Pro is Apple’s first attempt at building a computer out of all those ideas — a computer that works in the space around you. The goal is for the Vision Pro to be a complete device that can sit right alongside the Mac and the iPad in Apple’s ecosystem of devices and let you get real work done. You can use Excel and Webex and Slack in the Vision Pro, and you can also sit back and watch movies and TV shows on a gigantic virtual 4K HDR display. And you can mirror your Mac’s display and just use the Vision Pro to look at a huge monitor floating in virtual space. Related Apple’s view of the future is a lonely one Vision Pro apps: the good, the bad, and the ridiculous Meta Quest 3 review: almost the one we’ve been waiting for It sounds amazing, and sometimes it is. But the Vision Pro also represents a series of really big tradeoffs — tradeoffs that are impossible to ignore. Some of those tradeoffs are very tangible: getting all this tech in a headset means there’s a lot of weight on your face, so Apple chose to use an external battery pack connected by a cable. But there are other, more philosophical tradeoffs as well. As I’ve been using it for the past few days, I kept coming up with a series of questions — questions about whether the tradeoffs were worth it. Is using the Vision Pro so good that I’m willing to mess up my hair every time I put it on? Is it so good that I want to lug it around in its giant carrying case instead of my laptop bag? Is it so good that I want to look at the world around me through screens instead of with my own eyes? Basically, I keep asking if I prefer using a computer in there rather than out here. And as interesting as the Vision Pro is, there’s a long way to go before it can beat out here. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Hardware Apple doesn’t want anyone to think of the Vision Pro as a VR headset, but it’s a VR headset — albeit a VR headset that almost lets you pretend it’s not a VR headset. You put it on your head in a way that blocks out your vision entirely, and then it shows you a 3D video feed of the world around you passed through from the cameras on the front, as though you can see right through the device. But it can also put you in virtual reality, at various levels of immersion: I spent some time working entirely on the Moon and a lot of time in my kitchen with a bunch of windows floating around a portal into Joshua Tree. Defining “reality” is a messy business in computing. The past decade has seen a dizzying race to come up with new words for what head-mounted displays do, including disagreement over what each one of these phrases means. So here’s our interpretation of a few terms used in the review: Augmented reality: virtual projections that are directly related to objects in the physical world, like an automatic translation of a restaurant menu or a virtual poster pinned to a real wall. Mixed reality: a computing system that mixes the virtual and physical without direct interaction between the two, like an app window floating in your living room. Virtual reality: a computing experience that immerses you in a fully virtual space, deliberately blocking out your perception of the physical world. The Vision Pro is stunning compared to other VR headsets, which are largely plastic and often downright goofy-looking. The Vision Pro, by contrast, is built of magnesium and carbon fiber in an aluminum enclosure that feels like a natural extension of Apple’s familiar design language. There’s a little iPhone 6 in there, a little AirPods Max, a little Apple Watch. It is the cutting edge of technology in a package that seems instantly familiar. Almost everyone I’ve shown it to thinks it looks smaller in person than they expected, especially compared to some of the huge VR headsets we’ve seen over the past decade. The front display on the Vision Pro is an attempt at keeping you from being isolated from other people while you’re wearing it. In Apple’s photos, it looks like a big, bright screen that shows a video of your eyes to people around you so they feel comfortable talking to you while you’re wearing the headset — a feature adorably called EyeSight. In reality, it might as well not be there. It’s a low-res OLED with a lenticular panel in front of it to provide a mild 3D effect, and it’s so dim and the cover glass is so reflective, it’s actually hard to see in most normal to bright lighting. When people do see your eyes, it’s a low-res, ghostly image of them that feels like CGI. The effect is uncanny — the idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone is a fantasy. And there are no controls or indicators in visionOS for this external display, so you never really know what other people are seeing. Imagine looking someone directly in the eyes and talking to them without knowing if they can see your eyes — it’s weird! EyeSight is so weird. So, so weird. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge That cover glass hides a huge array of cameras and sensors. There’s a pair of high-res front cameras for the video passthrough, cameras that face down and to the sides to track your hands, a lidar scanner and TrueDepth cameras for spatial tracking, and infrared floodlights so everything can work in low light. Underneath all that, you’ve got an M2 processor and Apple’s new R1 spatial coprocessor and a pair of fans to move the heat from all this tech out the top. The fans were never perceptible during my time testing the Vision Pro, but the heat was: after long sessions, the headset was definitely warm. On the top edge, you’ll find what feel like larger versions of some familiar Apple Watch controls: a digital crown that adjusts both the volume and the level of virtual reality immersion on the right as you look through the headset and a button on the left that lets you take 3D photos and videos. You get two headbands in the box: the solo knit band and the dual loop band. They both attach and detach easily; you snap them right on and then pull the little orange tab to disconnect them. The solo band is unquestionably cooler and messes up your hair slightly less — but they both mess up your hair, so if the dual loop fits you better, just go with it. I found the solo loop much more comfortable; I also wish the mounting points were on the outside face so I could pull the band around my head and clip it on instead of constantly pulling it over my hair. The front of the Vision Pro is covered in cameras and sensors. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge The solo loop is by far the cooler strap. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The huge case costs an additional $199 and looks like a marshmallow from space. I love it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The other two pieces are the light seal, which comes in various sizes, and the headband, which comes in two thicknesses. (You get fitted for these in the store or by scanning your head with an iPhone if you buy online.) Both attach magnetically, which means they also detach magnetically — you want to pick this thing up by the frame because grabbing it by the light seal can lead to disaster. The idea that you’ll be making real eye contact with anyone while wearing the Vision Pro is a fantasy If you have glasses, you can click in custom Zeiss lens inserts — Apple sent us reader lenses to see what that process looks like, but I just used the Vision Pro while wearing my soft contacts, and it was fine. The Vision Pro’s speakers are housed in the arms on the side, and they are good and loud and do a convincing job of rendering spatial audio. Things really sound like they are happening where they appear to be happening, which is a neat trick. The speakers are also pretty leaky, so everyone else around you can hear what you’re up to unless you use headphones. You can use any Bluetooth headphones you want, but you get a bunch of extra features if you use the latest AirPods Pro, like lower latency, lossless 48KHz audio, and Apple’s Adaptive Audio system, which automatically mixes in sound from the real world as appropriate. Since you’ll mostly experience the Vision Pro in there, the most noticeable thing about the hardware after a while is that it’s just… heavy. You’re supposed to wear this thing on your face for long stretches of computer time, and depending on which band and light seal you use, the headset alone weighs between 600 and 650 grams. I keep joking that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but it’s heavier than an 11-inch iPad Pro (470 grams) and pushing close to a 12.9-inch iPad Pro (682 grams), so in a very real way, it’s an iPad for your face. All of the Vision Pro’s heft is totally front-loaded, too. Other big headsets like the Quest Pro (722 grams) have elaborate headbands to balance out their weight, but the Vision Pro just rests it all on the front. Swapping to the dual loop strap helps keep things more stable but doesn’t really reduce the overall sensation of having all that headset on your face. You’re just going to feel it after a while. The Vision Pro’s external battery pack is fine, mostly because it’s such a stationary device overall. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Notably, the Vision Pro is substantially heavier than the familiar Quest 2 (503g) or even the heavier Quest 3 (515g) — headsets that have built-in batteries. Apple told me that it chose to use an external battery specifically to reduce the headset’s weight. The battery itself is barely worth talking about — it’s a silver brick that weighs another 353 grams with a USB-C port and a motion-activated LED that’s green when it’s charged and orange when it’s not. It connects to the headset with a satisfying twist connector, but the nice braided cable is permanently attached to the battery itself, so don’t break it. You can buy extra batteries for $199, but you can’t hot-swap them; disconnecting the battery from the Vision Pro cuts the power entirely. I don’t really have strong opinions on this battery setup, which is mostly because nothing about the Vision Pro feels like you’re supposed to move around that much in it, so it’s more or less fine. It’s funny that Apple of all companies shipped this compromise, but it’s also very Apple that the battery is not actually bigger so it can provide more than two and a half hours of run time. (If you plug the battery in, the Vision Pro just runs on wall power for as long as you want.) Setting up the Vision Pro is dead simple — the headband adjustments are the only manual adjustments involved. Everything else is motorized and sensor-driven. There’s no fiddly lens wheel to dial in; the headset asks you to hold down the digital crown when you first put it on to adjust the lenses to your eyes, and then you go through a pretty standard eye tracking setup. The rest of the setup is almost exactly like any other iOS device: if you have an iPhone, you can bring it close to the Vision Pro to send over all your settings, and you have to agree to some terms and conditions. If you don’t have an iPhone, you’ll have to enter your passwords and so on manually, but it’ll work fine as a standalone device. After all of that, you’re computing in the future. See? It’s a VR headset. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Apple is very proud of the displays inside the Vision Pro, and for good reason — they represent a huge leap forward in display technology. The two displays are tiny MicroOLEDs with a total of 23 million pixels that are just 7.5 micrometers in size, which is about the size of a red blood cell. And each of those tiny pixels is composed of three RGB subpixels laid out in what Apple tells me is an S-stripe pattern. Just thinking about the level of precision required to make these displays and then make them work in a device like this is mind-blowing. They also look generally incredible — sharp enough to read text on without even thinking about it, bright enough to do justice to movies. Apple calibrates them for color at the factory so they are also vibrant and color-accurate without looking oversaturated or blown out. They are so small, but they work so well that they seem huge. The displays are the main reason the Vision Pro is so expensive — they’re at the heart of the Vision Pro experience and what makes the whole thing work. You are always looking at them, after all. But for all their technical marvels, they are not without tradeoffs of their own when deployed on a device like this. The speakers are nice and loud and convincing with spatial audio. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge See this thing — a passthrough VR headset with a silly external battery pack and a display that shows ghostly images of your eyes on the front — is not the big goal. The big goal is AR, or augmented reality. In particular, the big goal is optical AR, where light passes directly through unobtrusive glasses to your eyes, with digital information layered over the top of what you’re seeing. AR is a technology with the potential to literally change humanity, and Apple CEO Tim Cook has been talking about how isolating VR headsets are and how important he thinks AR will be for years now. Tim Cook, 2016: “Few people are going to view that it’s acceptable to be enclosed in something.” Tim Cook, 2017: “Unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world.” Tim Cook, 2017: “I also like the fact that [AR] doesn’t isolate [...] I’ve never been a fan of VR like that because I think it does the opposite.” Tim Cook, 2020: “I think [AR is] something that doesn’t isolate people. We can use it to enhance our discussion, not substitute it for human connection, which I’ve always deeply worried about in some of the other technologies.” You get the idea. The problem is that the technology to build a true optical AR display that works well enough to replace an everyday computer just isn’t there yet. The Magic Leap 2 is an optical AR headset that’s cheaper and smaller than the Vision Pro, but it’s plagued by compromises in field of view and image quality that most people would never accept. So Apple’s settled for building a headset with real-time video passthrough — it is the defining tradeoff of the Vision Pro. It is a VR headset masquerading as an AR headset. And let me tell you: the video passthrough on the Vision Pro is really good. It works! It’s convincing. You put the headset on, the display comes on, and you’re right back where you were, only with a bunch of visionOS windows floating around. It sounds simple, but it is an astonishing engineering achievement to do that in real time, at high resolution, in a computer that fits over your eyes. Apple claims there’s only 12ms of latency between what the cameras see and what’s on the display, and that latency includes the exposure time of the cameras themselves. The actual data processing is faster. Do the math, and Apple says there’s not even a frame’s worth of latency; the next frame of video is ready before you’re done looking at the last one. Still cameras, still displays. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge You can also see Apple’s incredible video processing chops right in front of your eyes: I sat around scrolling on my phone while wearing the Vision Pro, with no blown-out screens or weird frame rate issues. I also worked on my Mac in front of a large window while wearing the headset, which is a torture test for dynamic range, and while it wasn’t perfect, it was still usable. It is the best video passthrough that’s ever shipped in a consumer device by far. If you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow The problem is that cameras are still cameras, and displays are still displays. All cameras have motion blur, for example. In low light, cameras either have to increase exposure times at the cost of sharpness or increase ISO at the cost of noise, which then requires noise reduction, which makes things blurry and dull. And cameras and displays both have real limits in terms of color reproduction. The Vision Pro cannot overcome the inherent nature of cameras and displays. You can easily see motion blur when you move your head in the Vision Pro — motion blur that increases in low light and leads to some weird warping of straight lines. Low light also causes the overall sharpness of the video passthrough to drop as noise reduction kicks in: my iPhone screen got noticeably blurrier when the sun set. If you’re in a medium-lit room halfway immersed in a dark virtual environment with a bright window open — say, sitting in your kitchen at night with the lights on while writing a review in a Google Docs window floating on a dark beach — you will notice the display brightness slowly ramp up and down as the system tries to average out the brightness of everything you’re looking at. The LCD clock on my microwave flickers when I look at it through these cameras. And Apple’s specs say the display supports 92 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which means the Vision Pro can only show you 49 percent of the colors your eyes can actually see. Video The vision pro's video passthrough did not like the clock on my microwave. The displays have other limitations: the field of view isn’t huge, and the essential nature of looking at tiny displays through lenses makes that field of view feel even smaller. Apple won’t tell me the exact number, but the Vision Pro’s field of view is certainly smaller than the Quest 3’s 110 horizontal degrees. That means there are fairly large black borders around what you’re seeing, a bit like you’re looking through binoculars. On top of that, there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. All of this makes the usable field of view feel even smaller. If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast — a white text window floating above a dark desert landscape, for example — you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. A screen capture from the Vision Pro and a simulated view of what it feels like to look in the headset. I asked Apple about all of this, and yep — that’s how it’s supposed to look. Apple spokesperson Jacqueline Roy told me that a combination of hardware and software in the Vision Pro is specifically designed to minimize these various effects, but they’re definitely in there, and you’ll see them. You’re constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is a lot more interesting than that If you have been paying attention to VR for the past decade, you know that these are very familiar VR headset display issues. You’re passing light from a screen through lenses mounted on someone’s face and trying to line those lenses up with their eyes, which are notably in different spots on different people’s faces. (Our bodies are designed very badly when it comes to mounting hardware on them.) So a little weirdness at the edges of the displays is not a deal-breaker or even a surprise — except Apple is charging $3,499 for the Vision Pro and making it sound like these displays are perfect enough for you to casually wear this thing while folding laundry. I’m serious when I say the Vision Pro has the best video passthrough I’ve ever seen on the sharpest VR displays any normal person will ever come across. But you’re still constantly being reminded that you’re looking at video on screens, and reality is just a lot more interesting than that. There are vanishingly few contexts in reviewing consumer devices where anyone has to care about color gamuts — but if you want me to perceive reality through something, I’d like to see all the colors of the rainbow. This is the best anyone has ever made in there look, and it’s still not nearly as good as out here. Waiting. Watching. Ready to mess up your hair at a moment’s notice. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Controls The other thing Apple is very proud of is the eye and hand tracking control system, which is light years beyond any other consumer hand or eye tracking systems out there. You look at things you want to control, you tap your fingers to control them, and that’s how you get around the entire interface. You’re not reaching out and touching things — it’s more like your eyes are the mouse, and your fingers are the button: you tap them together to click on what you’re looking at. The first few times you use hand and eye tracking on the Vision Pro, it’s awe-inspiring — it feels like a superpower. The Vision Pro’s external cameras just need to see your hands for it to work, and they can see your hands in a pretty large zone around your body. You can have them slung across the back of the couch, resting in your lap, up in the air with your elbows on a table, pretty much anywhere the cameras can see them. It actually takes a minute to realize you don’t have to gesture out in front of you with your hands in the air — and once you figure it out, it’s pretty fun to watch other people instinctively reach their hands up the first time they try the Vision Pro. But the next few times you use hand and eye tracking, it stops feeling like a superpower — and in some cases, it actively makes using the Vision Pro harder. It turns out that having to look at what you want to control is really quite distracting. Think about every other computer in your life: the input mechanism is independent of whatever you’re looking at. On a laptop, you can click on controls and use the keyboard while keeping your focus on a document. On a phone, you can do things like drag sliders in a photo editing app while keeping your eyes focused on what those changes are actually doing to your photo. The Vision Pro simply doesn’t work like that — you have to be looking at something in order to click on it, and that means you are constantly taking your attention away from whatever you’re working on to specifically look at the button you need to press next. I spent some time playing a lovely little game called Stitch that quickly became maddening because I kept looking away from the piece I wanted to move to the place I wanted to move it, which meant I wasn’t picking it up when I tapped my fingers. Reach out and touch faith. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge visionOS feels also designed for an eye tracking system that’s just slightly more precise than it actually is — a lot of controls are just a little too small and a little too close together to let you quickly bop around the system. You have to look, make sure you’re looking at the thing you want, and then tap, or you might end up clicking on the wrong thing. Sometimes the fastest way to select what you want is to look away entirely and try again. It works until it doesn’t. It’s magic until it’s not. Think about it like this: The keyboard and mouse on a Mac directly control the Mac. The click wheel on an iPod directly controlled the iPod. A lot of work has gone into making it feel like the multitouch screen on an iPhone directly controls the phone, and when it goes sideways, like when autocorrect fails or an app doesn’t register your taps, it’s not pleasant. Your eyes and hands aren’t directly controlling the Vision Pro: cameras are watching your eyes and hands and turning that into input, and sometimes the interpretation isn’t perfect. The best example of this is the hilarious on-screen keyboard, which you use by staring at each letter and pinching your fingers to select it or henpecking with two fingers at the floating keys in front of you. It’s not worth using for anything beyond entering a Wi-Fi password — for anything longer, you’ll want to use dictation or connect a Bluetooth keyboard. Why? So you can directly control the input. It’s not a given that the Vision Pro can always see your hands, either. There’s a pretty large bubble around the front of your body where the cameras can see your hands — it basically extends the length of your arms in a semicircle around the front of your body. But if you lean back in a chair with your arm at your side, it can’t see your hand. If you’re sitting at a table and your hands are on your legs, it might not see your hands. If you’re lying down in a dark room and the IR illuminators can’t reach your hands, the cameras might not be able to see them. If you’re simply standing up with your arms at your sides, it might not be able to see your hands if they drift too far backward. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge I recognize that it is fundamentally silly to complain about a hand tracking system needing to see your hands, and it is possible to navigate quite a lot of visionOS with Siri and dictation: you can manage apps, open different virtual immersions, and so on. If you squint, you can see a glimpse of how a computer that you use by talking to it and manipulating things in space might one day work. But right now, the limits are obvious. Using the Vision Pro makes you constantly aware of what you are looking at and where your hands are in a way that is unlike any other computer I’ve ever used. When it fails, it’s maddening. (Oddly, Apple’s newest watches can detect a pinching gesture, but there’s no ability to use those as control devices on the Vision Pro.) The flip side is that a system that’s constantly watching your hands for input tends to register a lot of extra inputs, which can be very funny. I talk through writing video scripts to make sure things flow, and I talk with my hands. So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident. I cracked up the first time I realized what was happening. But eventually, it meant that I took the Vision Pro off and wrote the rest of the script on my Mac, which only does things when I actually want it to. Just as with the displays, I think this is the best eye and hand tracking system anyone’s ever shipped. It really can feel like magic… until it doesn’t. And if you want people to do their computing in there, the input system needs to be absolutely rock solid. Personas I won’t go into that much detail on Apple’s deeply weird and extremely uncanny 3D persona system here — the best way to understand them is by watching the video review above, which features a FaceTime call between The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern, Marques Brownlee, and me, all using our personas. To quote Marques, personas are really impressive and also really bad. You can see why Apple put the beta label on them; there’s a long way to go before using a persona on a call isn’t distracting at best and, at worst, extremely rude. I will say, Joanna’s persona accurately captured her reaction to personas in general here. Marques looks like he’s happy to welcome me into PlayStation Home. One small note: personas can show up whenever an app calls for a front-facing camera, so they work in basically everything. I used mine on a Google Meet call in Safari just fine, although the other people on the Meet call did not think it was fine at all. Spatial cameras I would not recommend shooting photos in the Vision Pro unless you really need to. Pressing the shutter button a single time delivers a 2560 x 2560 still, which works out to 6.5 megapixels. As far as I can tell, it’s always from the left main camera, which the EXIF data says has an 18mm f/2.0 lens. The photos look like 6.5-megapixel photos from a tiny camera sensor optimized for video, which is to say that they look pretty bad. 1/7 1/7 Video is slightly better — the Vision Pro shoots 2200 x 2200 square videos at 30fps. They look a little better than the photos, but there’s still an awful lot of compression going on, and if you happen to watch them on anything but a Vision Pro, you’ll notice some barrel distortion as the camera moves around. None of this feels particularly important: I really can’t think of situations where I’d want to be taking video with the headset on since all these videos and screen captures come with a ton of excess motion from your head moving around. Also, you will look fundamentally ridiculous trying to take photos of your family with this thing on your face. I think it’s fair to assume most Vision Pro buyers also own iPhones, which take great videos, so whatever. One thing that is very convincing is taking spatial videos on the iPhone 15 Pro Max and watching them in 3D on the Vision Pro. I took some videos of my daughter at the zoo and around Christmas time, and like any dad, I could probably watch them over and over again forever. They play back in a sort of ghostly white haze, and the overall effect is incredibly bittersweet — you can relive a brief memory, but you’re alone in the headset and can’t share it with anyone else. The other problem is that, currently, you can choose to shoot iPhone video in spatial in 1080p at 30fps or at the full 4K resolution the phone supports but not both. For now, I’m going to stick with the higher-res video, but there’s going to come a time where shooting in spatial by default is the smart move, and that will be a real turning point. visionOS The Vision Pro runs visionOS, which Apple says is based on iPadOS, with a lot of customization around latency and vision to make it work for spatial computing. Starting with the iPad as a foundation represents an incredible head start for Apple — it’s taken years for Meta to build out all the features of the Android-based Quest OS and populate its app store, and it’s still mostly games. Apple gets to start with the full set of mature iPadOS features and most of the huge iPad app library. It’s funny to keep saying that the Vision Pro is an iPad for your face, but when it comes to the current set of apps, it’s also not totally wrong. Most of them work like iPad apps, and the homescreen comes preloaded with a folder labeled “compatible apps” that’s full of actual iPad apps. It’s hard to judge the app ecosystem for a product that has barely launched, but I feel totally comfortable judging the iPad app ecosystem at this point, and Apple shipping its own podcast and news apps as iPad apps on the Vision Pro feels like a sign in a lot of ways. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge There’s already controversy in the world of Vision Pro apps: some huge developers like Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube have decided to wait before allowing their apps to run on the Vision Pro and aren’t even allowing their iPad apps to run. As always, the open web serves as the pressure release valve for Apple developer politics, and Safari on the Vision Pro is a capable riff on iPad Safari: I watched Netflix in Safari and it worked without a hitch, although you can’t put the video in a nice environment like you can with the native apps. I also watched the NFL playoffs on YouTube TV in Safari on the Vision Pro, and it worked with a few minor hiccups, although it did keep asking me to confirm my location over and over again. The stranger thing is that Safari on the Vision Pro is pretty disconnected from web-based 3D experiences. Apple has made noise about supporting the WebXR standard, and there are flags in Safari’s advanced preferences to turn on support, but it’s pretty hit-or-miss in terms of actually working right now — it mostly does not. I asked about this, and Apple told me that it is actively contributing to WebXR and wants to “work with the community to help deliver great spatial computing experiences via the web.” So let’s give that one a minute and see how it goes. On the other hand, I asked Apple why the huge library of VR video on YouTube doesn’t work at all on the Vision Pro, and the company basically told me it wasn’t good enough to support, saying that “much of this content was created for devices that do not deliver a high-quality spatial experience” and that the company’s efforts were instead focused on “delivering the best spatial media experience possible including spatial photos and videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 3D movies available on Apple TV.” Translation: don’t hold your breath for YouTube VR support. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The really big difference between visionOS and iPadOS is that iPadOS has a lot of opinions about how you can arrange apps and how many apps you can run at a time, and visionOS is full-on free-floating window chaos. I love it. It is bananas. You can open as many apps as you want and put them anywhere you want in space. You can open windows in the kitchen, walk away from them and open some more in the living room, and then go back to the kitchen to find all your old windows waiting for you. Late one night, I made an art gallery of giant Safari windows in our office’s large open cafe area and walked around, looking at huge webpages for a while. I am telling you, it is wild. Sadly, visionOS doesn’t have any ability to share these windows or experiences with anyone else: two people in Vision Pro headsets sitting in the same room can’t see the same things floating in space at the same time. Apple tells me some enterprise developers are working on experiences with shared views, and you can mirror the view from one Vision Pro to another over FaceTime, but in the end, my big Safari art gallery only ever had one patron: me. It’s amazing you can do all of this, but it is also quite lonely to put things all over a space knowing no one else will ever really experience it. Video You can put windows anywhere you want — I love it. To move windows around, you just grab the bar at the bottom and put it wherever you want to in space. You can layer windows, you can put them directly above your head, you can put them on the floor — you can really just do whatever you want. To switch between them, you just look at the window you want and tap your fingers; inactive windows go slightly translucent, which means all kinds of things can be happening at once all over your space. On top of that, you can have apps from three different operating systems on-screen at the same time: native visionOS apps; iPad apps; and then you can also connect your Mac via Wi-Fi and have a whole Mac display with all the chaotic glory of macOS floating around in space. One area where visionOS has clear room to improve is window management. There’s no Exposé or Stage Manager to collect all your open windows in front of you or put them into preset arrangements, and the management that does exist is not exactly discoverable or intuitively laid out. You can tap and hold the X button in one app to hide all your other apps. If you want to hide everything, you double-click the digital crown on the headset itself. If you want to close all apps, you just ask Siri; if you want to quit a misbehaving app, you hold down the top button and the digital crown simultaneously to bring up a force quit window. It’s a lot of different ideas all at once. Once you figure out the moves, you can get around, but it takes a minute, and it means you’ll be thinking about window management more than any other iOS device I can think of and maybe even more than a Mac, which has four decades of window management ideas built into it. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Speaking of the Mac, I know a lot of people are excited about the idea of buying a Vision Pro just to put up giant virtual monitors. There’s good news and bad news about that. The good news is that Mac display sharing works really well, and Apple ecosystem tricks like Handoff and Continuity are pure magic in this context. You can copy on your Mac and paste in visionOS, and it just works. You can open your Mac display in visionOS and drag the mouse off the screen, and suddenly, your Mac’s keyboard and trackpad are controlling visionOS apps. It works just like it does between a Mac and an iPad. I found myself putting a virtual Mac display over my MacBook Pro’s screen and making it look like I had a 50-inch laptop to use Lightroom with — it’s awesome. There is a lot of very complicated display scaling going on behind the scenes here, but the easiest way to think about it is that you’re basically getting a 27-inch Retina display, like you’d find on an iMac or Studio Display. Your Mac thinks it’s connected to a 5K display with a resolution of 5120 x 2880, and it runs macOS at a 2:1 logical resolution of 2560 x 1440, just like a 5K display. (You can pick other resolutions, but the device warns you that they’ll be lower quality.) That virtual display is then streamed as a 4K 3560 x 2880 video to the Vision Pro, where you can just make it as big as you want. The upshot of all of this is that 4K content runs at a native 4K resolution — it has all the pixels to do it, just like an iMac — but you have a grand total of 2560 x 1440 to place windows in, regardless of how big you make the Mac display in space, and you’re not seeing a pixel-perfect 5K image. It is incredible that all of this works with just a single button click, but all that scaling complication also explains the bad news: you can only have a single Mac display in visionOS. You can’t have multiple Mac monitors floating in space. Maybe next time. Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge One of the weirder things about visionOS (and the Vision Pro itself, really) is that there’s not a lot of true AR in the mix — as in, actual interaction between physical objects in your space and digital ones. After all these years of Apple talking about AR, I counted exactly three things in my entire time with the Vision Pro that offered a preview of the AR future. One: when you look at your Mac, the Vision Pro sometimes puts up a “connect display” button above it that starts screen sharing. Two: when you’re typing on a Bluetooth keyboard and look down at your hands, it puts a little text preview window above the keyboard so you can see what you’re typing. These are little features, yes, but they are some of the first true AR computing features that have ever shipped on a mainstream device, and they are an incredibly tantalizing glimpse of what might be possible. They also happen to be incredibly useful. The third AR thing I saw was the loading screen of Super Fruit Ninja, which allows you to throw a strawberry at a pig that’s running around on your floor. This seems slightly less historic. That’s more or less it. There’s not a lot of reality being augmented in the rest of visionOS. There’s an awful lot of what you might call mixed reality: virtual objects floating around in space with no connection to anything real. All those app windows floating around are doing so independently of the physical environment. And in the entertainment context, where Apple lets the Vision Pro fall back into being the VR headset it fundamentally is, it absolutely shines. Watching movies on the Vision Pro is a ton of fun, especially in the Apple TV app’s immersive movie theater that lets you pick where you want to sit. It’s also very cool to watch a movie in one of Apple’s virtual environments like Mount Hood and see the colors from the screen reflect onto the landscape or look around one of the Disney Plus environments like Avengers Tower. And movies themselves look great — the incredible quality of the Vision Pro’s displays is really obvious when you’re watching something. I watched far more of Top Gun: Maverick than I intended to just because it looked so good blown up to drive-in movie size, floating over a mountain. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge Since the Vision Pro sends separate images to each eye, it can do true 3D movies — and Apple and its partners like Disney have already released quite a few. If you have a large Apple movie library, you get the 3D versions for free — you just choose 2D or 3D playback when you hit play. Apple is also making immersive versions of some of its Apple TV Plus shows, which basically means a 180ish-degree 3D video that feels like the best Google Cardboard demo of all time. I watched someone walk a tightrope in Adventure, and it was very convincing — but if you’ve never tried this before, I’d be careful that you get used to VR motion before diving into 3D videos. Apple has also promised immersive sports content, but sadly, I wasn’t able to try any of that yet. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV — but after a while, the weight of it reminds you that this very nice TV is resting on your face. (I usually made it about 30 minutes to an hour before wanting a break.) It’s also a very expensive TV that doesn’t have HDMI inputs, so you’re limited to Apple’s gaming library, which feels deeply unfair. And unlike any other TV in your life, the Vision Pro can literally DRM your eyes — if you’re watching a movie in the Apple TV app or Disney Plus and go to take a screen capture, the content blacks out. It’s strange to experience a reality where big companies can block you from capturing what you see, even if all you’re trying to do is show people how cool it looks in a review. You can get around DRM screenshots on an iPhone by just taking a photo of the screen, but there’s no such off-ramp for the Vision Pro. Speaking of gaming, there aren’t any real VR games or fitness apps here — there’s nothing like Beat Saber or Red Matter or Population: One, all hit games on the Quest. Fitness, in particular, has helped the Quest reach a more mainstream market: Supernatural’s Chris Milk told me in 2021 that his user base is 50 / 50 men and women, 60 percent of whom are over 40. That led to Meta buying Supernatural outright because it was worried about Apple buying it first. You can get pretty far making the argument that the Vision Pro is worth it simply as a very expensive TV Yet, there’s just nothing like that on the Vision Pro at launch, even though Apple is so focused on fitness and health across its other devices. I think it’s because the Vision Pro just doesn’t seem suited to those kinds of physical game experiences — it’s heavy, with that external battery, and it’s hard to see how some of these games would even work without controllers. Apple tells me that game developers working in Unity are hard at work porting over more games and that visionOS allows developers to come up with custom hand gestures, which might solve for some of the controller issues — I was able to try a prerelease version of Super Fruit Ninja that used a custom slashing gesture in a briefing, and it seemed to work well, but that was about it so far. One note about VR motion in the Vision Pro: it doesn’t really do anything to protect you from yourself. I am fairly comfortable in VR — my wife and I use Supernatural, and I went through a brief, delightful period of being absolutely addicted to Gran Turismo 7 VR on the PSVR 2. I am pretty aware of my limits in VR motion, and I can do most things without a problem. But the Vision Pro is so convincing and so unconcerned with whether you might have any limits that you can easily go too far too fast and get yourself a little queasy. I watched five minutes of Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D in Disney Plus — the Vision Pro is the first consumer device to support high frame rate movies in 3D! — and immediately needed to stop because the motion was just too much. I recommend early adopters go slowly and make sure you find your limits gently. That first bout of VR motion sickness is no joke. Wrap up The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There’s a part of me that says the Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge. That’s good! There are a lot of ideas in the Vision Pro, and they’re all executed with the kind of thoughtful intention that few other companies can ever deliver at all, let alone on the first iteration. But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can’t ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn’t. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge The other way to look at the Vision Pro is that Apple knows all of this, but the technology to build the true AR glasses it has long hinted at is simply not there — so the Vision Pro represents something like a simulator or a developer kit. A dream factory for people to build apps and meaningful use cases for the imagined hardware yet to come: true optical AR glasses that let you share digital experiences with other people. In that framework, this Vision Pro is the hardware Apple can ship right now to get everyone thinking about these ideas while it pours all those resources into the hardware it wants to build. Maybe! It’s fun to think about that possibility, and a lot of people have already assumed that’s the case. But one of the oldest rules we have here at The Verge is that you have to review what’s in the box — the product that’s shipping today, not the promise of improvements yet to come. And so I keep coming back to all the questions I’ve been asking myself ever since I first strapped the Vision Pro onto my head. Starting, of course, with the most important: Do you want a computer that messes up your hair every time you use it? Do you want a computer that smears your makeup every time you use it, if you wear makeup? Do you want a computer that allows the Walt Disney Company to prevent you from taking pictures of what you see? Do you want to use a computer where you easily can’t show anyone else what you’re looking at? Do you think the fanciest TV you own should have HDMI inputs? Do you want to use a computer that doesn’t work as well in a dark room? Do you want to use a computer that is always looking at your hands? That is a lot of tradeoffs — big tradeoffs, not little ones. And the biggest tradeoff of all is that using the Vision Pro is such a lonely experience, regardless of the weird ghost eyes on the front. You’re in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in. After using the Vision Pro for a while, I’ve come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating. That’s fine for traditional VR headsets, which have basically turned into single-use game consoles over the past decade, but it’s a lot weirder for a primary computing device. I don’t want to get work done in the Vision Pro. I get my work done with other people, and I’d rather be out here with them.

My hats off to the Verge; great job. I have racked up hours upon hours of actual, productive work in my Quest 2 and 3, so to say that I am a big proponent of the ideas that Apple is trying to advance would be an understatement. This makes me all the more disheartened to read that, for all their efforts, this release is mired by the same drawbacks that I have encountered across numerous headsets over the last decade: > [..] there’s a little bit of distortion and vignetting around the edges of the lenses, and you’ll see some green and pink color fringing at the edges as well, especially in bright environments. [..] If you’re looking at something bright or otherwise high contrast [..] you’ll see highlights reflecting in the lenses. Prior to this review, I was actually willing to understand certain seemingly odd decisions, such as the concept of putting an OLED display on the outside, the potential for weight distribution issues, and an external battery, as I was hopeful that, similar to the iPhone, there'd be a cohesive whole in the end that wasn't fully understandable until reviewers got to use it. I also was, somewhat naive, I admit that, under the impression that their handling of vignetting, etc. would be less noticable then what seems to be the case and, again naively following their marketing videos, had higher FOV expectations. To draw a parallel, the initial iPhone made some major tradeoffs and at the time odd choices, to say the least, many of which were laughed at for arguably justifiable reasons at the time, but I could see something in that that went beyond then-available touch-only smartphones and PDAs in terms of usability and cohesiveness. I fail to see the same in this review. Neither as an actual user nor as an enthusiast, do I see anything here that has not been done before. While your then-PDA may have supported 3G and came with many other capabilities the first iPhone lacked, there were certain things in regard to build, design, usability and intuitiveness that were unparalleled in the products at the time. Comparing an iPhone and an iPAQ Pocket PC made the latter seem ancient, even though it could do a lot the iPhone couldn't. Compare a Vision Pro to a Quest 3, I am saddened to say I don't see the same. reply bombcar 18 hours agoparentThe whole thing feels very ... \"original xbox\" to me. Hear me out. It was argued that a big part of the original xbox for Microsoft was making sure they had a toehold in the gaming console market because that market had a change of disrupting the personal computer - and if that happened, they wanted to be there for it and have something ready to go. They did something similar with phones, and we can see how it spectacularly failed - they have zero say or relevance in the massive smartphone market. I almost feel the Vision Pro is Apple's attempt to put a toe in the water just in case this VR stuff takes off and destroys the smartphone market. reply PaulHoule 18 hours agorootparentGood analysis. Part of it too is that Apple feels pressure to do something innovative. They made some big bets in the 2000s that paid off very well but a company that has a hit like the iPhone becomes profoundly conservative. The trouble is that there aren't many market opportunities bigger than smartphones, there's a possible iCar and an iHouse and that's about it. Apple's worst fear might be being successful as a niche product: what if every seat of Dassault 3Dexperience ends up with an Apple Vision Pro? Apple might be left with the maintenance burden forever but no real prospects for a mainstream product. reply nox101 18 hours agorootparentI wonder if an iTV would sell. All mondern smart tvs are covered in ads and spying. monitors of similar sizes cost 3x to 4x. so to me there might be a market for a non spying iTV with bultin Apple TV for say 1.5x. Or not, not sure enough people care about those issues. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentApple TV already exists as a set-top box. And even something similar embedded in some TVs. What I could see Apple doing is some kind of \"Made for Apple TV\" feature that combines eArc, HDMI, etc, and makes the TV turn into a \"dumb TV\" for the Apple TV when it is connected and detected. reply mynameisvlad 12 hours agorootparent> And even something similar embedded in some TVs. I don't believe there is an \"tvOS Embedded\". \"Apple TV+\" is just an app within the OS; there isn't really any similarity between the embedded app and tvOS. reply smaccona 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat I do is buy a smart TV, never connect it to the network (thus making it a dumb TV), and plug an Apple TV (or other devices) into it. So far, this has worked - I haven't seen any ads from the TV itself (the apps running on the Apple TV are another story), and it can't phone home about what I'm watching or otherwise doing with the TV. reply TeMPOraL 10 hours agorootparent> and it can't phone home about what I'm watching or otherwise doing with the TV Are you sure? The old idea of giving TVs built-in cellular backup connection is probably still too risky/expensive - dealing with people extracting and repurposing the SIM card with a free (for them) data plan is a hassle. But what about eSIM? reply badwolf 9 hours agorootparentWhy bother with an esim, when you can use something like Amazon Sidewalk, just use whatever nearby Echo or other device to send whatever small data packets reply bigbabybuckman 10 hours agorootparentprevIntriguing and possible I suppose; Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. However, I imagine the numbers would show it's unnecessary these days. My humble estimation is that most people, at least in the developed world, connect the TV to wifi for the convenience if available. reply fzzzy 8 hours agorootparentprevput a faraday cage around your house lol reply TeMPOraL 1 hour agorootparentMark my words: one of these days, there will be a huge national security scandal involving data stolen from a SCIF, possibly with loss of life as a consequence, and it'll turn out there wasn't any intelligence op or treason involved - just adtech fuckery getting out of hand. Think disposable microphone and eSIM in a popcorn bag, sending telemetry to a publicly-readable S3 bucket, or something, because it's superbowl and they HAVE TO know if you're watching. reply PaulHoule 17 hours agorootparentprev10 years ago I thought Apple would fail if they tried it because they'd have a chauvinistic attitude about having HDMI or any other ports that aren't Ethernet. (You can't plug your phonograph into an iPod) For that matter I'd expect them to have a chauvinistic attitude about connecting to my home theater. Back then you were just going to have to deal with the rubbish cable box but I think Apple wasn't going to stand for it. Today Blu Ray seems to be on the way out and so is the cable box (now we have the spectacle of seemingly competitive vMVPDs that are all priced the same within a few dollars), it now is going to be a fight over game consoles. TVs though have a serious race to the bottom and the TV with an Amazon Fire TV built in is going to be attractive to a lot of people. (Also already Apple makes a \"TV\" removes the tuner and replaces the HDMI ports w/ something else and calls it a \"monitor\" and charges 5x. No way are they going to cannibalize that market to sell something that only costs 1.5x) reply Someone 17 hours agorootparentprevI think a problem with TVs for Apple is that they’d be under pressure to build them in a zillion different sizes. That’s not in their DNA. A good beamer might be more fitting for them; they would only have to build them in ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’. In either case, like you I’m not sure the market is large enough for a company of Apple’s size and DNA (it’s unlikely that they’ll try to find not one huge next big hit, but lots and lots of smaller ones. They’re not Ikea) reply Aaronmacaron 12 hours agorootparentNot really. The vast majority of modern TVs are 43, 55 or 65 inch sizes. That's three sizes. reply hbn 17 hours agorootparentprevApple won't even make a consumer-targeted dedicated monitor, I can't see them doing a TV. reply throw0101d 17 hours agorootparentprev> I wonder if an iTV would sell. All mondern smart tvs are covered in ads and spying. Probably best to just connect TVs to some box (Apple TV, Roku, etc) via plain HDMI and leave it that. There's no technical reason to connect TVs to an IP directly anymore IMHO: what would that actually provide over and above what you get with some box/stick? reply PaulHoule 16 hours agorootparentI like wall-mounting TVs but it sure is a mess to have a power cable and two or three HDMI cables and a composite cable (got a VCR, rubbish Denon receiver won't convert composite to HDMI) and an Ethernet cable and who knows what else hanging below it. Now that I think about it it wouldn't be hard to cut a few holes and route the cables through the wall and have them come out in a spot that's not too conspicuous but who's going to do that? People who believe in aesthetics uber alles (Apple fans?) might appreciate a TV that has just a power cable and connects through WiFi but you could mostly accomplish that with the right kind of stick. You might say in 2024 who needs a cable box or Blu Ray but game consoles are still a reason to have HDMI. (Though somehow I think Apple would think plugging a Playstation into an Apple TV is as unthinkable as plugging a phonograph into an iPod.) reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentprevEthernet over HDMI exists, luckily it hasn't taken off ... reply timcederman 14 hours agorootparentprevDo you not feel Apple has been successful with the Watch and AirPods? Their wearables revenue dwarfs the revnue of most top tech companies. reply PaulHoule 14 hours agorootparentBoth of those are accessories to the phone. reply bakje 11 hours agorootparentActually, I find airpods to be very usable as bluetooth earbuds for all kinds of devices, these days I mostly use them behind my desktop PC when playing games and they work just fine. When I pop them out of the case they automatically connect to my PC just like they would an iPhone or other apple device. They won't automatically switch to the PC like they would for apple devices but they also won't just switch from the PC so I don't mind. Taking them out doesn't pause media but the play/pause controls do work. I do think that most people without an iPhone won't buy them so they're essentially still bought as iPhone accessories, but they don't have to be! I agree about the watch though, that's definitely an iPhone accessory. reply kogepathic 17 hours agorootparentprev> Apple might be left with the maintenance burden forever but no real prospects for a mainstream product. This seems unlikely. Apple has not hesitated in the past to exit market segments they felt did not suit them. To name a few: servers, displays, routers. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentAnd to be fair to Apple, on those sunsetted products, they supported them quite well during the sunset and even after, especially the Xserve. reply n6242 36 minutes agorootparentprevBut VR has been going on for a while now. I have a VR headset, I use it occasionally and I love it because it allows things that wouldn't be possible in any other platform. But strapping something on my face is not something I'd want to ever use as my main system. It's like a racing wheel, you use it for some games but it doesn't replace a controller so it's just a very niche product. reply jspaetzel 6 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft failed to disrupt the smartphone market because they tried doing it at a period of all time low Microsoft sentiment, especially in the developer community. If they tried it again today, it might actually work. Apple putting a toe in the water is roughly equivalent to Microsoft's HoloLens effort. I wouldn't compare it to Xbox or even the Windows Phone. Ironically Apple might fail here because they're developer relations isn't exactly great right now and they might lose this the same way Microsoft lost mobile. reply renhanxue 8 hours agorootparentprev> just in case this VR stuff takes off I think the last few years have pretty conclusively proven that there is no VR train to miss. It remains mainly a novelty (with some niche uses) and none of its fundamental issues have been resolved. reply wkat4242 4 hours agorootparentI think it's pretty great already tbh. I use it almost daily. reply mhh__ 18 hours agorootparentprevI could imagine that might have been why it came about originally but that line of thinking doesn't seem to justify the R&D spend alone. I'd imagine they have some belief in it being able to make new business of its own. If I'm not mistaken this is the first properly post-Steve product? reply CharlesW 17 hours agorootparent> If I'm not mistaken this is the first properly post-Steve product? Jobs publicly bemoaned the lack of, and presumably thought a lot about, \"headphones for video\". I think it's a safe bet that he set the stage for Apple Vision (and probably sketched out a 50 year plan) with current Apple leaders before his death. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO0OGmNDKVg > \"You know, the fundamental problem here is that headphones are a miraculous thing. You put on a pair of headphones, and you get the same experience you get with a great pair of speakers, right? > \"There's no such thing as headphones for video, right? There's not something I can carry with me that I can put on, and it gives me the same experience I get when I'm watching my 50-inch plasma display at home.\" reply Topfi 16 hours agorootparentYeah, I honestly hadn't thought about those statements in quite a while. Thanks for bringing them back to mind. It makes me ponder whether they had a very rough, early prototype of an FPV display device at that time, and if so, what that looked like. The interviewer briefly mentions what was available at the time, which Steve calls \"lousy\", so it could also be that he was more fascinated by the inherent concept. As is often the case, I'd give a lot for companies such as Apple to be more open with their ancient prototypes once a new device gets launched. Sometimes brands, such as Microsoft[0] in the console field showcase iterative prototypes or even produce full-on documentaries of their history, but rarely for new device categories. I understand why that's not possible, but still, one can dream.

This is definitely the first post-Jony Ive product though. (Rumors are that Ive was against the idea of doing a headset from the start, so it happened either without him, or after he left, depending on when it started.) - [0] https://www.wired.com/2015/04/the-apple-watch/ > Ive began dreaming about an Apple watch just after CEO Steve Jobs’ death in October 2011. reply Topfi 18 hours agorootparent> This is definitely the first post-Jony Ive product though. Ironic considering, if there is a product whose design arguably should be driven by an obsession with reducing weight and thickness, the AVP is it. reply ketzo 18 hours agorootparentprevI think AirPods were post-Steve? And they were both widely mocked at launch and wildly successful. reply wharvle 18 hours agorootparentLike so many Apple things, I thought AirPods were dumb until I got some (as a gift). I'd tried some Logitech wireless earbuds just a couple months before first trying AirPods. Those were dumb. God they sucked. I've avoided the Watch for that reason. The little conveniences of various Apple-thingies are the sort of stuff you can't un-experience, and then you're stuck buying the damn things forever. reply hbn 16 hours agorootparentI think about this frequently while using my AirPods. It's annoying that we're all becoming accustomed to spending anywhere from like $130 to $250 on in-ear headphones that aren't guaranteed a particularly long lifespan, to replace wired headphones that an acceptable quality pair can be had for like $15. But I'll be damned if the AirPods experience isn't far more convenient, and has me using them more than I ever did with wired headphones because they're so quick and easy to use. I can pop one in an ear and immediately I'm listening to a podcast while doing laundry. No cord tethering my head to my pocket, nothing to get snagged on a doorknob, it just works. When I pull one out of my ear it pauses, and resumes when I put it back in. When you only have one AirPod in, it knows and automatically converts the audio stream to mono so you still hear everything. Still would be nice to have the 3.5mm jack back, but I certainly haven't felt a desire to go back to wired headphones since I got AirPods. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentprevIf it makes you feel any better, I think the watch is more of a \"pickup or put down\" device, especially if you do not usually use a watch. I sometimes wear it religiously, meaning all the time, and sometimes religiously, meaning only for an hour on Sundays and holy days ;). reply jes5199 12 hours agorootparentprevI got an Apple Watch in 2019, and I don't wear it anymore. It was just another thing that needed to get charged every day, and none of the apps are very useful, and most of them are buggy and poorly supported. reply cozzyd 5 hours agorootparentI'm surprised people put up with daily charging in a watch where sleep tracking is a core feature. reply mcphage 18 hours agorootparentprev> that line of thinking doesn't seem to justify the R&D spend alone I'm sure they're also looking to use the technologies they develop for this in other products, too. reply monkeynotes 18 hours agorootparentprevNo way will this tech destroy phones as you know them today. What is going to destroy phones is natural language. Maybe, maybe in the distant future this tech will be mature enough to provide the visual support to a natural language first device. xBox addressed a very well defined product sector with a couple of big players doing stuff that is well understood. xBox wasn't a toe in the water, they planned a whole strategy around it using known facts about the industry, how people play, what kind of games work, they didn't break much new ground with the xBox. All they had to do was make a compelling, affordable gaming device that had amazing games on it. The rest takes care of itself. Apple Vision Pro is nothing like that. There is no existing market to put your toe in, there are no real competitors, we haven't even found a killer use case for these devices. No one really knows how these AR/VR devices can fit into everyday life. Currently Apple is working on finding the water to put their toe in. Right now they are at an exclusive oasis when they really need an ocean. reply mostlysimilar 18 hours agorootparentHard disagree. Phones and computers do text/images/video. Voice input and audio output is a poor substitute for text and not at all a replacement for images/video. reply monkeynotes 16 hours agorootparentI didn't say there wouldn't be a screen. But natural conversations will be much more fluid and efficient than a keyboard and google search. Having a conversation is so much better for all sorts of applications. Today's smartphones have to evolve this way, imo. I don't know what the most efficient hardware realization would look like but I imagine it's something that isn't in your pocket most of the time, more of a sleek wearable. It will need to be able to hear and see what you do. reply orangecat 17 hours agorootparentprevRight. And there are too many scenarios where audio I/O isn't usable (quiet libraries, loud streets) so you always need an alternative. reply vel0city 18 hours agorootparentprev> they didn't break much new ground with the xBox I kind of disagree with this. They made networking and online gaming on consoles finally a thing most home consumers were interested in. Sure, there were some earlier forays into online gaming/networking on previous consoles (SegaNet, for example), but those were generally pretty niche. Sega only included a dial-up adapter by default, while the Xbox shipped with an Ethernet adapter. Shipping the Xbox with Ethernet made networking on the box pretty simple right at the time when people started buying home routers and broadband internet and opened up the console to easy LAN gaming. Microsoft made Xbox Live a pretty massive feature of the console a year after launch. While Xbox Live launched a year after the console shipped, I'd still say the planning of it and including the Ethernet port was something nobody else in the console gaming world was doing and ended up defining the console gaming future. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentA big part of the success of the Xbox (and maybe it's not the Japan destroyer the fanboys wanted it to be) was that they really really let it be its own product, and develop an ecosystem. They not only made it a \"PC for your TV\" which was widely what it was held as on release, but also expanded the capabilities of what a console was expected to do. Sadly they also popularized and solidified the \"pay to play games online\" feature of consoles, vs the \"online play is free except for MMOs\" that PCs normally have. reply kemayo 11 hours agorootparentprev> No way will this tech destroy phones as you know them today. What is going to destroy phones is natural language. I'm extremely skeptical of this, just because of the vast number of situations where speaking-out-loud isn't going to be desirable. It'll have a place, for sure, but I think it'll be more of a supplement to our current phone paradigm. reply throwuwu 18 hours agorootparentprevMobile phones and VR are different non competing markets. AR might eventually compete with phones once you can wear an AR device all day everywhere you go. AR and VR should be treated as distinct; a good VR headset is bad for most AR usecases and vice versa. Maybe at some distant time there will be hardware capable of doing both really well but not for many years. VR fits into daily life as a social experience and will be obvious once eye, face and full body tracking are included with the headset. Even before that if someone solves the network problems with concurrent users and delivers an experience that handles audio well enough to work with multiple people having conversations within earshot of each other. AR is really just putting screens and overlays everywhere, conversational interfaces will have more and better impact than that. reply chrischen 18 hours agorootparentprevMaking interfaces natural language is like making all buttons touch screen. Versatile, yea, but in practice it can be less efficient than dedicated controls or more tactile interfaces. reply monkeynotes 16 hours agorootparentBare in mind I am not anticipating the Google Home level of interaction, I am talking full sophisticated natural language. And there is no reason touch cannot play a role, I'm just saying these devices will be unlike our current phones. I've listed some use cases that I think beat out touch easily elsewhere in the comments. reply tverbeure 18 hours agorootparentprevNatural language is even worse than video for quick content consumption: you can’t quickly skip through content that way the can fast scroll through a blog post. reply monkeynotes 16 hours agorootparentNatural language in place of other inputs, the command can result in summoning up a video for you, or a blog post to view. If I am cooking and can hold a whole conversation with my virtual chef,that beats a video though. Talking through ideas at my desk would be great. Talking for navigation while I drive, yes please. Shopping with my headphones on and the device seeing everything I see and making suggestions about deals, recipe options, what's low in your pantry, and so on. I'll take that. I see technology becoming more and more transparent in our life. User interfaces will feel awkward when all you need to do is say \"show me a video of cats\" and it serves it to your companion screen without ever needing to touch tap any UI. No need to even have a web UI for youtube. Just an API and your device does the rest. It can show you a list of related videos without YouTube themselves providing anything more than the data model. The cost cutting of not needing sophisticated front ends will be a big driving factor if this is as effective as I think it could be. Anyways, my head is full of ideas like this. reply HDThoreaun 17 hours agorootparentprevNatural language wont work as the main control until we have a nueralink type product. I dont want to be talking at my computer constantly. reply JKCalhoun 18 hours agorootparentprev> What is going to destroy phones is natural language. Then the Watch is the future. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparentDick Tracy will have his revenge, in this model or the next. reply m3kw9 18 hours agorootparentprevNatural language really sucks as a UI because a lot of things can be done faster than when you speak it. Like volume control as a tip of the iceberg example reply Ancapistani 16 hours agorootparentprev> No way will this tech destroy phones as you know them today. This device? No, absolutely not. I see it as a speculative play by Apple: release a very capable device with a bare-bones ecosystem at a high price. \"Early adopters\" will buy it because that's what they do. \"Influencers\" will buy it, because that's what they do. Their social media posts about it will give Apple all the data they need to nail down the size of the potential market. Finally, developers will buy it, because it's cool tech. We'll tell ourselves that it's an emerging market, and we can get it early. The launch of the iOS App Store spawned a gold rush for app developers; I expect that the launch of the AVP and its visionOS App Store will do the same. The size and profitability of that opportunity will be determined by how well Apple develops and popularizes the product. This is where I'm at on it. I expect the AVP to be best-in-class in terms of hardware and OS-level integration (though, to be fair, I expect the latter will be limited at first in odd ways, in the grand Apple tradition). I'll get one. I plan to use it for productivity, and as long as that justifies the cost I'll be happy with it. I'll also work on some minimal apps for visionOS. The purpose there will be to \"skill up\". If Apple releases a more consumer-focus headset that gains adoption, I'll be in a good position to take advantage of that by selling paid apps that are already mature by the time the general public are getting on the bandwagon. > What is going to destroy phones is natural language. Maybe? We've heard about \"wearable computing\" and \"personal area networks\" for decades at this point. While it still feels like something in the near future, the truth of the matter is that for a large segment of the population, it's already here. I already have an iPhone with me whenever I'm away from home, and usually an iPad as well. If I'm going to be away from home for a while, I've got an MBP in my backpack. All of those devices can hand off tasks between each other to an increasingly large degree - it's not uncommon for me to pull out my phone to show someone a website I had open on my laptop before I left home, then pull out my iPad if they're interested in it so they can interact with it more easily. Until recently, I had an Apple Watch surfacing an integrated notification stream from all of the above. Today, smartphones are the central \"wearable computing\" device that ties everything together. They act as a hub for a computing experience. There's no guarantee in my mind that it will continue in that role forever. Maybe the hub will end up being the descendant of the AVP. Maybe it will be something more akin to a Humane AI Pin, or a Rabbit R1. In other words... phones have already destroyed phones. Smartphones are really wearable computing hubs that we just happen to still _call_ \"phones\", because that's what they used to be. They're very rarely used for telephony, and many other devices are capable of doing so. > Maybe, maybe in the distant future this tech will be mature enough to provide the visual support to a natural language first device. My hope is that it ends up being a \"spatial\" interface that provides a generic interface so it can be used by pretty much anything. reply bombcar 16 hours agorootparent> They're very rarely used for telephony, and many other devices are capable of doing so. This is a really important distinction. And if you calculate your phone bill by actual minutes used for talking, it's an insane number of dollars per minute. I'd be completely unsurprised if the amount of \"talking on Zoom/Teams/voice chat\" is soon to surpass the total number of minutes talking on phones. reply penjelly 11 hours agorootparentprevit feels like theyve been doing RnD on VR/AR, bleeding cash, and theyre making a product to \"justify\" this cash burn to me. That plus shipping a product is the only way you can iterate, and a common mentality in tech companies is \"to ship\". IMO theyre late to the game, and excited to see if they can offer anything new reply rewgs 2 hours agorootparentprevApple's approach to both AR/VR and ML/AI is giving me big \"Microsoft missing the boat on mobile\" vibes. reply pjmlp 18 hours agorootparentprevOriginall XBox was also a money sink for Microsoft, bleeding money, bringing everyone on board to develop for it. Modern Apple is anything like that. reply thelastparadise 8 hours agorootparentprevUh I guess you aren't respecting the NDA then? reply m3kw9 18 hours agorootparentprevBut it isn’t hard to see that people who are constantly glued to their phones scrolling wouldn’t want to just have the screen on their faces instead of holding it. To me it’s the natural evolution of the way we absorb digital info/entertainment reply hammyhavoc 4 hours agorootparentprevNow do Microsoft and the HoloLens. reply chris-orgmenta 18 hours agoparentprevSorry for the slight tangent, but: What's the current state of VR&AR Headset friction / boot time? This is what I expected Apple to solve first. With VR/AR headsets, the friction to 'boot in' seems to be one of the biggest problems in adoption, and one that I feel Meta et al don't openly talk about. (Note, I am ignorant of this field in general). How close are we to seamless, quick boot, such that one puts on a headset and are 'immediately' immersed? (Compare to my phone, which unlocks before my eyes even have time to focus on the screen). (My admittedly poor) web searching of this question just tends to offer webpages on common boot issues (e.g. 'Quest boot time'/'Vive startup time' just leads to complaints and support forums.) I suspect this also to be a primary issue with the true 'metaverse' taking hold. GTA6 will, in my opinion, be the luxury 'hang-out' metaverse, but will likely take many minutes to access. I feel that Microsoft could have made Minecraft the de facto metaverse (by implementing certain features), but will never quite get there. Perhaps a WebGL game that can take you to a bookmarked 'spacial' lobby within 3000ms can get real traction. reply jayd16 18 hours agorootparentThis is a pretty strange complaint to me. When you use a VR headset you don't really put it on and take it off frequently during a session. When you take it off you can plug it in and it'll stay in standby, which is similar to phone standby. Its also not any slower than Playstation standby. reply chris-orgmenta 18 hours agorootparentIt's not a complaint (from me or my acquaintances), it's something that I thought (possibly incorrectly, but as mentioned I am ignorant hence me asking) was a hindrance to the success of the market. I.e. when I speak to most people re: VR/AR, they say something like \"It sounds like a lot of faff\", or \"I have one gathering dust, I can't be bothered to use it\". I have no skin in the game and no intention of buying anything for another couple of years at least, FWIW. Anyway: Sibling post says ~5 seconds from standby - Which seems very reasonable to me, so I suppose it's just lack of compelling features (subjectively to the people in question, not regular users) that result in the 'gathering dust'... Which means the people I have spoken to haven't wanted to bother keeping it on standby (thus increasing the barriers further). reply kllrnohj 11 hours agorootparentIt takes substantially more effort to put it on than it does to \"boot up\" And while it may sound weird that putting it on is such an ordeal, keep in mind that there's a lot of inherently fiddly bits and many have compromises. Like the PSVR2 requires me to go turn the lights on, because it uses inside-out tracking which doesn't work well in a dark room. But also you have to fiddle around with the position of it, get it in a comfortable spot, wiggle it a bit so the lenses line up with your eyes as you had it last configured, etc... Then realize that you smudged the lens with your forehead so take it off and clean it and do it again but more carefully this time. reply s3p 17 hours agorootparentprevHaving used a Quest 2 and owning a Quest 3 personally I can tell you the delay is essentially zero. It takes 2-3 sec to get the headset fully secured around your head, and the Quest will wake up the very moment it starts to get moved. That's part of the reason it annoys me so much-- just moving the controllers will wake it up, even if it's sitting on my desk. reply sph 1 hour agorootparentYou can turn that feature off, at least on the Quest 3 reply aranelsurion 10 hours agorootparentprev> just moving the controllers will wake it up, even if it's sitting on my desk. Odd that it doesn't work that way for me with controllers, maybe it's a setting you chose? For me no amount of moving the controllers or even pushing the buttons or triggers will wake the headset, it only wakes up if I put it on or through the power button. reply Topfi 18 hours agorootparentprevCold boot time on a Quest is roughly half a minute, though most of the time, you'll just wake it up from standby. For testing, I just put my Quest 3 on my head, and without pressing the power button, I counted five mississippis (seconds) before I was fully in their heavily customized version of Android with hand tracking recognizing my digits. reply wharvle 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat's booting? Nothing I use with any frequency gets rebooted except for updates, more or less. Exception: non-Apple stuff. Because those things tend to die while \"sleeping\" and unplugged, very quickly (my secondary work Windows laptop, which burns almost half its battery per 12 hours in \"sleep mode\"; my Steamdeck, which is barely better than that; the Switch though it's almost always on the dock anyway so that's rarely an issue) reply chris-orgmenta 17 hours agorootparentI agree that we should pretend that my question said \"from standby\" instead of \"boot\" reply wharvle 17 hours agorootparentIf it's like iOS devices, I'd assume less than a second to interactive, potentially so fast that most people don't notice it isn't instant.

I picked it up, spent 10 seconds finding the power button, hit button, put it on, waited 25 at the meta logo then was in VR. Didn't test opening a game but for a big one it's probably the same 10-45 seconds to start I'd imagine. It's not something I ever really thought about, you boot it once a session and it goes idle/wake, not hibernate if you just put it on your desk for a minute. The MQ3 is WAY better than my Vive and better even than the MQ2 at being a \"throw on and gun\" quick device. It's way lighter, less work to get going with.

When I see comments like this, and there seem to be many, I can’t help but think VR is a technology in search of a problem. With every platform Apple has launched they show the problem it will solve for customers and I just don’t see that here, and really haven’t seen it with any VR headset, at least not enough to overcome the downsides. I can’t help but think of this video of Steve Jobs… “you’ve got to start with the customer experience and work backward to the technology. You can’t start with the technology and try to figure out where you’re going to try and sell it.” https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oeqPrUmVz-o reply PaulHoule 18 hours agorootparentprevI got a Hololens 1 that turned out to be a white elephant and I read a lot of stories about people buying VR headsets and abandoning them so when I got an MQ3 I was quite deliberate about getting a variety of games and apps and spending enough time with VR to succeed at it. reply theNJR 18 hours agorootparentI co-founded a (failed) vr startup so I’ve got my 100 hours in the Oculus and Vive reply tfandango 18 hours agoparentprevOut of curiosity, what are you using for work on your Quest? I also have a Q2 and have tried, maybe not too seriously, several of the screen sharing apps to do work but couldn't quite get past the resolution and lag. Perhaps that has gotten better since, it's been some time. Instead now I use it for entertainment and very much like it, but if I could make that next leap it would be great! reply Topfi 18 hours agorootparentFor that purpose, the difference between the Q2 and Q3 was so vast that I cannot oversell it. While it's still not perfect due to the resolution, the switch to pancake lenses made screencasting to the Q3 something I could do for many hours at a time and enjoy it, whereas on the Q2 with the limited sweet spot in the center, it was really only for very specific use cases. On the Q2, even slightly off center becomes unreadable; on the Q3, you can move your eyes right to the panel border and still read text at the edge. The main use case is heavy multitasking with Confluence, Jira and an IDE in full-sized windows. reply tfandango 18 hours agorootparentThank you. Your experience with the Quest 2 mirrors my own. I'm undecided if I will try a Q3 or skip a generation. It definitely seems like things are moving in the right direction and I'm excited about that! reply tuscen 3 hours agorootparentI'd advice you to skip another generation. I can give my experience with it. I have Q3 and try to use it for work from time to time and it is still not enough to replace an actual monitor, at least for me. FOV of 110 degress is too narrow, maybe 140 degress would solve it, but I'm not sure. The thing is that apparently I glance to content without turning my head a lot and I discovered it when I tried to use Q3 for actual work. Even though the lenses and POV are much better than on Q2 and other wired VR glasses it's not enough for me still. Also sometimes reflections in the lenses are too bright and distracting and I don't know how to fix this. Resolution is much much better than Q2 and Quest S that I also have, but it's still not enough. And IPS panel is the biggest downside of it. That should've use OLED instead. But the main problem that stops me from using it is the smoothness of the whole process of starting to work. You can't just sit behind you desk, put on the glasses and start working. The whole process reminds me of preflight preparation: you need to ensure that the software is running and correctly setup on you PC and that's not always the case. You always need to ensure that you have controllers by your side, because hand tracking often fails, and Q3 often struggles to find my hands at all. Basically, software wise it's not there for a 100% smooth ride like with screens where you just sit at your desk and start to work without a single hitch. In short, it's like a death by thousand cuts. Some people can tolerate some of them and can use Q3 for work, but in my case I wasn't able to tolerate any of them and that kills it for me for now. I hope for Q4 or maybe Quest Pro 2 after seeing a slim prototype that Mark showed some time ago. reply swozey 18 hours agorootparentprevVirtual Desktop for desktop work reply tinyhouse 18 hours agorootparentprevSame. I find it useless for work stuff. I have a large screen at home and in the office. I don't need to look at a large screen through a heavy headset on my face that I feel bad after wearing for more than 30 min. I also don't find the VR meeting experience better than a zoom call. reply KronisLV 11 hours agoparentprev> I have racked up hours upon hours of actual, productive work in my Quest 2 and 3... I have a Quest 2 right now and attempting to use it for desktop computing just doesn't work all that well for me (their Quest Link app with desktop windows, or SteamVR desktop feature; might also have to use the Meta Workspace app or whatever it was called in the future). All of the text feels a bit blurry and it's like the resolution just isn't there. I don't even have that high of a resolution dev setup outside of VR, just four 21.5\" monitors running at 1080p. I do catch myself squinting a little bit at them sometimes, but 10, 11 and 12 font sizes (in JetBrains IDEs and VS Code) seem too small in VR and going bigger decreases the lines of code per screen to an annoying degree. Best I can do in VR for that ends up being one huge monitor in front of me, two on each side, as well as a huge overhead one, but that leads to a lot of turning my head, maybe just a bit more than I'd like to. I'm not sure whether it's the headset with the lenses that's messed up, whether it's my eyes that are just bad, or the fact that the distance between the lenses should be a little higher than the headset allows for (at least based on what an IPD test I read online suggests), but the end result is that the experience isn't very good... yet. reply treprinum 18 hours agoparentprevNever buy version 1 I guess (unless the company is fighting for survival and has to deliver, with 100% focus). reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 18 hours agoparentprev> I have racked up hours upon hours of actual, productive work in my Quest 2 and 3 I have a lot of questions. Would you recommend them? Do you work primarily in VR? I haven't tried VR but the use-case I envision is to put on a VR headset and be \"at work\". reply Topfi 18 hours agorootparent> Would you recommend them? Yes, no, maybe. Thing is, I've never used a device or software that I haven't found faults with. Overall, the Quest has turned into a solid, though still imperfect, platform, with Meta pushing updates at a consistent, but also breakneck pace, sometimes at the expense of addressing existing issues. Hand tracking from the early days of the Q2 has made massive leaps and has become my preferred method of navigation for its reliability and ease, yet at the same time, the changes in camera placement between the Q2 and Q3 lead to a decrease in controller tracking performance in very specific scenarios. Essentially, they are constantly experimenting, both on the hard- and software front, trying to optimize what they can within their very low price point. Still, if you are interested and have an idea what you'd like to use the headset for, I'd recommend trying one within the return window, though I'd strongly suggest adding a \"halo-style\" strap (BoboVR is my current favorite) for comfort. > Do you work primarily in VR? No, a more healthy mix between a single 27\" JOLED and the Quest 3 for workloads that require more screen real estate but can go without as much overall resolution. About 60/40 in favor of the regular panel. reply jbellis 17 hours agorootparentI use my xreal air as my airplane display. I would love the Quest 3's higher resolution but my understanding is that compared to the XA the Q3 - Requires controllers - Requires wifi instead of plugging in the cable and it just works* - Has fairly limited battery life Am I mistaken on these points / do you think it would work on an airplane despite them? * To be fair, the XA only \"just works\" in vanilla display mode, the fancy xreal multiple virtual monitors feature called Nebula doesn't work well enough to be worth the hassle. reply Topfi 16 hours agorootparentTried my hand at a Viture One for two weeks, but the diopters did not work with my specific vision, perhaps I'll give the new XA2 a shot now that they are more available in the EU. Concerning your question, it's very different. While VR content can be cast both over USB or wireless, for flat-screen casting, wireless is the preferred and most comprehensively supported way, which, whilst tether-free, can be less seamless when out-and-about than just plugging in a cable. Note that wireless does not require a local WiFi router or internet connection but can also be handeled directly from a host device, still, less reliable than a plain cable carrying video signal. Furthermore, as the Quest has its own full on operating system based on Android, rather than receiving an HDMI signal like the Viture or XA, there is an additional point of complexity to consider, and it looks a lot less inconspicuous than the XA. Lastly, tracking via the cameras is a great advantage in general use, though a very inclosed, darkish space such as an aeroplane may push the small sensors to their limit and yes, battery life can be a limit as well, though I do hot-swap BoboVR battery at the back of my skull for that. Still not as convenient as just using your phones power and having that charged. Quest does not require an controller at this point, hand tracking is currently my prefered way of navigating the system day-to-day. Overall, I'd agree, on an airplane I'd consider the Quest to be of marginal usability. reply igammarays 17 hours agoprevThis review confirmed this is exactly what I need. I don’t care about my hair messing up, I work from home. I don’t care if the display doesn’t look as good as reality, that was never my expectation anyway. The display just needs to look good enough to work with fine text and hi-res images. I don’t care if it’s too heavy to wear for hours at a time, I always work in 25 minute blocks anyway. Breaks are good. I don’t care if personas look creepy, Zoom virtual backgrounds are also creepy. I don’t care if the eye/hand tracking isn’t up to par for “serious” work, I plan to use it with a keyboard and mouse anyway (at least while working, not in entertainment/writing mode). Every single “fault” which this reviewer mentioned doesn’t matter to me, I was never expecting this device to replace reality for me anyway. What I want is, the ability to have large displays laid back on my bed/couch, and the ability to walk around the room and place different open Safari windows and apps around my physical space as I think and study some new topic.

So as I was writing the video script for this review in the Vision Pro, the system kept catching my hands moving and started scrolling and clicking on things by accident.

The only obvious thing not available in iPad Pro is much smaller and higher quality screen. Hopefully they can reduce price to $1500 in next few generations and increase functionality: - macOS support (We can only probably dream about it) - usb-c / hdmi out so this can replace desktop iMac when connected to external monitor (still probably unlikely) - 3rd party access to cameras stream if given permission - hard to make any innovation with this hardware if you cannot even detect QRCodes because Apple doesn't provide any API and you don't have access to camera feed. reply HDThoreaun 10 hours agorootparentprevI heard the display alone costs $1000.

Consider how when people own both an iPhone and an iPad, they almost always use the iPhone, even for use cases in which the iPad is superior. It's quicker, more flexible, hassle-free, always ready.

The tracking hardware is just commodity accelerometers/gyroscopes for high resolution (albeit only relative) motion sensing, and a constellation of IR LEDs to give a clear reference point for the headset cameras to follow in absolute space and correct the IMU drift. Knowing Apple they would more likely follow the lead of the Quest Pro controllers though, which have their own set of cameras and perform their own inside-out tracking independently of the headset. It's expensive and power hungry but more robust since they work just as well when the headset can't see the controllers. reply teeray 18 hours agoprevI feel like this will be a spectacular flop.

One has worked with VR for research, and is familiar with the HTC Vive and Meta Quest headsets, but has not used VR for personal use. The other person used the Quest for gaming, and has been curious about Apple's approach. Outside of people with past experience using VR, though, I haven't personally heard people talking about Apple's version. The price point is likely a major factor: a larger number of people could imagine owning an Apple Watch or iPad shortly after release (even if relatively pricey), in contrast to the Apple Vision Pro upon release. reply spacemadness 14 hours agorootparentPeople already invested in VR are not a big market at Apple’s scale. reply johnnyanmac 6 hours agoparentprevTo be fair, the iphone was subsidized by AT&T back in the day and was sold out for $200 or so, and the earpods and Watch weren't more than $300 we're arguably in a recession right now and this device is priced higher than almost any other apple product in history.

When the Vision Pro was announced, Apple was its typical self by not revealing anything about another future product (plus, the iPhone is its flagship, and Apple likes to keep the excitement coming from its actual announcement). Shooting spatial videos will be a standard feature on all iPhones in a couple of years. It will stay if the Vision product range continues to do well enough while Apple iterates and figures out the product positioning (Apple is generally good at these things). If it doesn’t work out well enough for Apple’s satisfaction, this will go the way of 3D Touch on some older iPhones.

In the review they note that the experience is “lonely”, even if you and your spouse both had Vision Pro you would still watch content separately as there is no way (at least right now) to sync your experience. This most probably will be addressed in a software update, but the first point still stands - you will need to buy as many headsets as you have people in your house that want to watch content together. reply causal 18 hours agoprevMany HN'ers are probably like me, in that hearing about its imperfections is kind of a relief.

Plus I get to add additional apps outside the screen if visionOS natively supports them (Slack, email, and iMessage are good examples. Plus the web browser can be a native app. You can seamlessly move your mouse/keyboard between them and copy/paste too.) The weight is definitely on the \"let's see how big of a deal this becomes\" list though. reply PKop 15 hours agorootparentYes but it doesn't hurt your neck or make you sick after a few hours while also having better resolution and easier usability for basic computer interactions. Vision pro as desktop computer replacement sounds like a Rube Goldberg solution to a problem that doesn't exist. Possibly Vision Pro as laptop screen replacement sounds plausible but I still don't think the UX will be comfortable nor do I think the virtual screen will actually hold up as good for typing/reading text. A mouse, keyboard, and proper monitor/screen work likely work better than a virtual screen without all the well known negatives that come with the latter. We'll see how it plays out though. reply ninkendo 10 hours agorootparentIt feels like you’re arguing with me, but I’ve already said twice that the comfort level is still an unknown and that if it’s too uncomfortable I’m going to return it. Also worth pointing out that the mouse seamlessly moves from your Mac screen to any native Vision Pro apps. So if I do all my web browsing in “native” Vision Pro, then add in Slack and Messages and Mail as native vision pro apps (using the same keyboard and mouse for input, mind you), I will likely only be using the virtual Mac screen for my IDE.

    "originBody": "Intel’s Humbling Posted onTuesday, January 30, 2024Tuesday, January 30, 2024 Author by Ben Thompson There are times when being a semiconductor CEO is rather easy. Just consider Brian Krzanich: when he took over the Intel job in 2013, I wrote in The Intel Opportunity: A new CEO has taken over Intel. Their core business, upon which the company has been built, is floundering. Does the new CEO, who is not really new at all (he’s the current COO), have the vision to ensure Intel’s continued success? I’m not talking about Brian Krzanich, who today was promoted from COO to CEO at Intel. Rather, I’m talking about Andy Grove, who took over Intel in 1987. The crisis Grove encountered was Intel’s floundering memory business; he exited memory and focused on logic chips, and the rest was history. I thought that Krzanich should do something similar: Intel should stop focusing its efforts on being an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) — a company that both designed and manufactured its own chips exclusively — and shift to becoming a foundry that also served external customers. Back to the Article: Today Intel has once again promoted a COO to CEO. And today, once again, Intel is increasingly under duress. And, once again, the only way out may require a remaking of their identity. It is into a climate of doom and gloom that Krzanich is taking over as CEO. And, in what will be a highly emotional yet increasingly obvious decision, he ought to commit Intel to the chip manufacturing business, i.e. manufacturing chips according to other companies’ designs. Krzanich did not take my advice, and this is what happened to Intel’s stock during his tenure: The thing is, if you don’t invest in the future, or see fundamental changes in the market coming, then you don’t have to spend as much; if you don’t have to spend as much then you can increase margins. And, while there were some analysts that could foresee the extent to which fabs were dramatically increasing in price, and would thus need to significantly increase volume to maintain profitability in the long run, this was clearly a case where Wall Street mostly cared about the forecast for the next quarter or the next year. All of this was compounded by the assumption that Intel would stay in the process lead forever; indeed, while I was right about the changing costs of foundries and the need for Intel to open up to outside customers, in 2013 I didn’t forecast Intel losing their process leadership. That happened under Krzanich too: TSMC started manufacturing 7nm in volume in early 2017, and Intel announced a delay in 10nm (which was roughly equivalent to TSMC’s 7nm) in April 2018. And yet the stock went up, faster than ever. Intel’s Struggles Later that year Krzanich was fired for having a relationship with an Intel employee; Bob Swan stepped into the CEO role, but it was ultimately current CEO Pat Gelsinger that is paying the price for Krzanich’s lack of strategic foresight and total fumble in terms of execution. Consider the company’s earnings announcement last week; from Bloomberg: Intel Corp. tumbled the most in more than three years after delivering a disappointing forecast, a reaction that Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said Friday was overblown. The shares fell 12% to $43.65 in New York after Intel’s first-quarter projection for both sales and profit came in well short of Wall Street estimates. It was the biggest single-day decline since July 2020. The outlook sparked fears that Gelsinger’s long-promised comeback bid has gotten off track. Though the chipmaker’s personal computer business is recovering, demand is weakening in the lucrative market for data center processors. Intel also is contending with a slowdown in programmable chips and components for self-driving vehicles, and a fledgling business that makes semiconductors for other companies hasn’t yet taken off… During a conference call with analysts, Gelsinger acknowledged that the first quarter wasn’t going as well as hoped, but that he expected the rest of 2024 to improve quarter by quarter. Intel’s efforts to return to the cutting edge of manufacturing are still on track, he said. That’s crucial to improving its products and staying competitive. He also asserted that the chipmaker is no longer losing sales to competitors in PCs and data centers. This stock price decline was just one of many under Gelsinger’s leadership: This past quarter continues many of the trends driving this multi-year decline: client PCs are finally making a comeback from the COVID hangover, but many of Intel’s non-CPU businesses are struggling and/or facing inventory corrections, including MobileEye, networking, and FPGAs. The biggest problem, though, continues to be the data center: AMD makes better CPUs on a better process (TSMC’s) and they continue to eat Intel’s lunch amongst the biggest cloud providers who, because they buy the most CPUs, are willing to do the work necessary to make the best performing chip work (this is why Intel’s on-premise and government business has long held up better). That direct competition is compounded by the secular pressure from ARM on one side and the diversion of spend to GPUs (primarily Nvidia, but also AMD) on the other. Intel’s Progress This is where being a semiconductor CEO is very difficult. Over the last few years Gelsinger has done exactly what needed to be done a decade earlier: he is transforming Intel into a foundry that serves external customers, and he is working to at least make Intel competitive again on the leading edge, and maybe even take the lead in a few years, if you believe Intel’s claims about its 18A process. 18A is the fifth of the fabled “five nodes in four years” that Gelsinger promised shortly after he took over, and it appears that he is pulling it off. Gelsinger summarized those five nodes in a Stratechery Interview last fall: So Intel 7 is the last of the pre-EUV technologies. Intel 4, the first EUV technology for us, Intel 3 refined the final FinFET, really helped us take those learnings, but largely was a common architecture of transistor and process flow — really just the refinement. Much like you say, TSMC and others have done, get the initial one working and then refine it for scale manufacturing, that’s Intel 3. And given it’s the second generation of that, we’ll be applying that to our big server products, Granite Rapids, Sierra Forest, big die. We need to get down the learning curve with Meteor Lake, our first client partner. And then now with the big server die, and that’s also what we’re introducing on Intel 4, more so on Intel 3, a lot of the advanced packaging technologies come big into the technology footprint. Then the new transistor, the new backside power begins with 20A, and for that Arrow Lake is sort of the first, get it up and running small die, something easier to design and then when we get to 18A, the journey is done. To summarize:Transistor Lithography Power TSMC Equivalent Intel 7 FinFET DUV Frontside 7nm Intel 4 FinFET EUV Frontside 5nm Intel 3 FinFET EUV Frontside 4nm Intel 20A FinFET EUV Frontside 3nm Intel 18A RibbonFET EUV Backside 2nm The TSMC equivalents are a bit fuzzy, particularly once you get into the future; TSMC CEO C.C. Wei has been adamant on the last couple of TSMC earnings calls that TSMC’s advanced 3nm process will outperform Intel’s 18A (Intel’s argument is that backside power will make chips much easier to design, since the power is separated from the communications layer, eliminating interference). What’s important, though, is that that is a question worth answering. Gelsinger said of 18A, which is the process that Intel is pushing hard to potential foundry customers, on the company’s earnings call: We are first in the industry to have incorporated both gate-all-around and backside power delivery in a single process node, the latter unexpected two years ahead of our competition. Arrow Lake, our lead Intel 20A vehicle will launch this year. Intel 18A is expected to achieve manufacturing readiness in second half ’24, completing our five nodes in four year journey and bringing us back to process leadership. I am pleased to say that Clearwater Forest, our first Intel 18A part for servers has already gone into fab and Panther Lake for clients will be heading into Fab shortly… Our success with IFS will be measured by customer commitments and revenue. We have taped out more than 75 ecosystem and customer test chips. IFS already has more than 50 test chips in the pipeline across 2024 and 2025, 75% of which are on Intel 18A. During CES, we welcomed the Valens Semiconductor to the growing list of foundry customers as they announced they would use IFS to fabricate their MIPI A-PHY chipsets using our advanced technology. In addition to the 3 Intel 18A customers we disclosed in Q3, we won a key design win with a significant high-performance computing customer. This customer was particularly motivated by our unique leading-edge manufacturing capabilities and U.S. capacity. We came into 2023 committing to one 18A foundry customer. We executed on four inclusive of a meaningful prepay and our momentum continues to grow. The ultimate proof point for Gelsinger’s strategy will be chips designed by external customers, fabbed on Intel’s 18A process, running in devices in people’s pockets; nothing is assured until then. That, unfortunately, is the rub: there is no revenue until then either, and “then” is still a few years into the future. One wonders if Gelsinger will be there to enjoy the uplift that would only then be justified, at least from the perspective of Wall Street. From my perspective — which, as exemplified by my disappointment with Krzanich despite Intel’s great stock returns during his tenure, is absolutely not stock-picking advice — he very much deserves the chance. Intel has the right strategy and seems to be executing; the challenge is that semiconductor cycles operate in something closer to decades than years, much less quarters. Intel’s New Partner So what does Intel do in the meantime? Last week also brought news of a very interesting new partnership that helps answer that question. From Nikkei: Intel and Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) on Thursday announced a partnership that will lead to production in the U.S. state of Arizona by 2027, part of the American semiconductor company’s push to expand its business of making chips for others. The partners will develop relatively mature 12-nanometer technology, ideal in building chips for Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, microcontrollers, sensors and a range of other connectivity applications, but not for cutting-edge central processing units or graphics processors. Intel said the long-term agreement can leverage its U.S. manufacturing capacity and UMC’s extensive foundry experience in mature chip production technologies that serve a wide range of chip developers. Based in the Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, UMC is a smaller peer of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world’s biggest contract chipmaker or foundry. UMC is the world’s third-largest contract chipmaker. Last week I wrote about TSMC’s earnings and explained how TSMC has been forced to increasingly adopt the old Intel model, first in pricing, and then in its equipment usage: The leading edge costs a lot of money to ramp up — N3 is lowering margins for now, as every new node does its first few years — but those costs are made up for by the ability to charge much higher prices. To that end N3 is already up to 15% of TSMC revenue, followed by 35% at N5, and 17% at N7. This reality is not new for TSMC, but it is different than how the company has operated historically. TSMC started out as a foundry selling trailing edge chips; the primary way of making money over the long run was to build a fab relatively cheaply using established equipment, and then run that fab for many years. Once all of the equipment was depreciated, every chip produced was almost pure profit, even if the revenue on a per-chip basis was fairly low. It was Intel, on the other hand, that charged the highest prices for the fastest chips, and all of its business was on the leading edge, selling its own chips; that meant that the company would take down old fabs and repurpose as much equipment as it could for the next node, instead of running the fab forever like a foundry would (this is one of Intel’s challenges in becoming a foundry: they simply don’t have much depreciated trailing edge capacity throwing off cash). What is interesting to note is that TSMC’s shift to a more Intel-like model in terms of its revenue drivers (leading edge) and profit drivers (high prices) is starting to impact how they manage their fabs. CFO Wendell Huang said in his prepared remarks: In addition, we have a strategy so that some of our N3 capacity can be supported by N5 tools given the strong multiyear demand. Such a plan will enable higher capital efficiency in the mid to long term, but requires cost and effort in the near term. Most of this conversion will occur in second half of 2024, and we expect it to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in second half of 2024. Notice what is happening here: TSMC, unlike its historical pattern, is not keeping (all of its) 5nm capacity to make low-cost high-margin chips in fully-depreciated fabs; rather, it is going to repurpose some amount of equipment — probably as much as it can manage — to 3nm, which will allow it to expand its capacity without a commensurate increase in capital costs. This will both increase the profitability of 3nm and also recognizes the reality that is afflicting TSMC’s 7nm node: there is an increasingly large gap between the leading edge and “good enough” nodes for the vast majority of use cases. This Intel-UMC deal represents the inverse of what is happening at TSMC: a viable foundry business can’t just rely on selling leading-edge chips at very high margins — particularly since Intel’s claims that it will regain process leadership remain to be seen. What is critical is having fully depreciated foundries still making chips: yes, those chips cost a lot less than the leading edge, but given that the marginal costs are practically zero (at least relative to the fixed costs) they are an important source of cash flow and profits, which can be re-invested in the leading edge. This deal is about capturing that depreciated cash flow. Intel’s Needs Intel, however, as I noted, only ever needed leading edge fabs — no one wants an old Intel chip when newer and faster ones are on the market. This was a big reason, of course, why Krzanich so badly missed The Intel Opportunity: in 2012 Intel was right in the middle of the FinFET-deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography era of chip fabrication, but the end of both was already on the horizon in the form of RibbonFET (i.e. Gate-All-Around transistors) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Given the astronomical costs of EUV in particular it would have been reasonable to forecast then that there might develop a sweet spot making FinFET transistors with DUV, but Intel missed out on a decade of building up the capability to serve external customers. This capability — or the lack thereof — remains one of the biggest questions around Intel’s foundry efforts. In 2022, when Intel tried to buy Tower Semiconductor, I wrote in an Update: It is not only the case that Intel primarily makes its own designs, it also makes only digital chips (i.e. everything is a 1 or a 0). However, there is also an entire universe of analog chips, which can process gradations; this is essential for processing data from the physical world like sound, power, light, etc. Tower specializes in a whole host of specialized chips in the analog space; adding Tower’s capabilities to Intel Foundry Services (IFS) will make the latter much more of a true one stop shop for chip fabrication, matching the capabilities of TSMC or GlobalFoundries. To me it is the GlobalFoundries angle that is the most interesting here: I have long been a proponent of Intel buying GlobalFoundries, despite the fact that GlobalFoundries isn’t a particularly great business, has given up on the leading edge process race, etc. My thinking has been that Intel can bring the capability (maybe) and willingness to invest in the leading edge, while GlobalFoundries can bring the breadth of capabilities and customer service orientation necessary to be a foundry. Sure, that’s expensive, but allowing IFS to be choked off by Intel’s integrated and not-invented-here culture would be even more expensive. I suspect the Tower acquisition firmly closes the door on that possibility (which to be fair, was clearly remote). Here the calculus is much more straightforward: Tower brings certain capabilities and customer relationships that Intel believes it can scale up inside its factory network at a much lower cost than GlobalFoundries (whose current market cap is $29 billion), and it will be much easier to absorb and integrate into Intel’s business. The big question is whether or not integrating into Intel’s business is in fact the entire problem that needs to be avoided. At Intel, manufacturing has always called the shots. The design side of the company had to accommodate the fabs, whether that be using their archaic design software, working around manufacturing challenges, or figuring out how to make a faster chip on recycled equipment. This made sense for a long time, but there was a cost: Intel designs stopped being innovative and became dependent on Intel’s manufacturing for performance; when Intel’s manufacturing prowess hit a wall Intel’s designs were exposed. Gelsinger told me: So all of a sudden, as Warren Buffet says, “You don’t know who’s swimming naked until the tide goes out.” When the tide went out with the process technology, and hey, we were swimming naked, our designs were not competitive. So all of a sudden we realized, “Huh, the rising tide ain’t saving us. We don’t have leadership architecture anymore.” And you saw the exposure. Indeed, we see the stock price! That, though, was only part of Intel’s problem: the more fundamental issue is that a foundry is, as I wrote, a customer service organization: an entity like TSMC adapts to customers’ designs, not the other way around. They use industry standard design software. They have extensive libraries of IP that make designing a chip more akin to assembling a collection of Lego blocks. They ship when they say they will ship, and they run the fab for which a chip was designed forever. Intel did none of these things, and had a mentality and culture that ran in the exact opposite direction: in a foundry, manufacturing is not king but a servant; customer sales is not about “take-it-or-leave-it” but “let us help you solve your problem.” I was — and frankly, remain — dubious about Intel’s ability to create that sort of culture internally, which is why I advocated for an acquisition, first of Global Foundries, and then of Tower. Thanks to its decade delay Intel didn’t have time to learn how to serve customers: it had rapidly obsoleting fabs that needed to be filled as soon as possible, if the company ever had hope of making enough cash to fund its push back to the leading edge. Unfortunately China blocked the acquisition of Tower, in what I suspect was retaliation for U.S. restrictions on China. Worse, from what I have heard Intel responded by starting to sell a lot of old equipment at rock-bottom prices, which usually ended up in China; the fact of the matter is that the company needs cash. Intel’s Humbling Perhaps, though, the fire-sale is coming to an end: all of this context explains why this deal exists, and why I think it is a fantastic idea: UMC, like GlobalFoundries before it, has struggled to keep pace with ever more expensive fabs. The company has a 14nm offering, but has shown little evidence it can or will go further, and the EUV transition seems completely out of the question. However, UMC does have a large foundry business, which is to say that UMC is a customer service organization, with the compatibility and IP necessary to succeed. Intel, meanwhile, has a ton of capacity with FinFET and DUV processes. One of the costs of the company’s failure at 10nm and 7nm was that the company built extra 14nm fabs. A huge amount of that equipment, particularly the lithography, is not useful for the leading edge, but it is fully depreciated and could be used to build pretty fast chips for a lot less than the leading edge. This deal — which is for a new, designed-for-external-customers 12nm process — brings together the two companies’ core capabilities: UMC is the customer service organization, and Intel is the manufacturer. Yes, that means lower revenue and margins for both, but both have already built the capabilities necessary to make the deal succeed, which means the business should be accretive to both revenue and profits for each of them. The big question is how big of a market there is for fast-but-not-the-fastest chips: Intel is talking up things like communications chips, image sensing processors, etc., but a new process will require new design wins. Moreover, TSMC is counting on the same market for its 7nm process: that process should be faster, but it is also more difficult to make (7nm requires quad-patterning, while 12nm is dual patterning; this means easier designs, higher throughput, and better yields for the latter). It is also, one might say, a bit humiliating: mighty Intel, which bestrode the tech industry for 50 years, the keepers of Moore’s Law, is making a deal with a Taiwanese also-ran, because it needs the help. That, though, is no insult: Intel needed some humbling, and this deal, more than any 18A design win or lofty promise about the AI PC, gives me hope that the company is in fact turning things around.

They've moved up so many process nodes so quickly and have made some earnest headway in being an actual fab. Let's ignore the elephant in the room which is taiwan and it's sovereignty, and only focus on the core r&d. Intel flopped so hard on process nodes for 4 years up until Gelsinger took the reigns... it was honestly unprecedented levels of R&D failure. What happened over the 8 years prior was hedge funds and banks had saddled up on Intel stock which was paying healthy dividends due to cost cutting and \"coasting\". This sudden shock of \"we're going to invest everything in R&D and catch back up\" was news that a lot of intel shareholders didn't want to hear. They dumped the stock and the price adjusted in kind. Intel's 18A is roughly 6 months ahead of schedule, set to begin manufacturing in the latter half of 2024. Most accounts put this ahead of TSMC's equivalent N2 node... Fab investments have a 3 year lag on delivering value. We're only starting to see the effect of putting serious capital and focus on this, as of this year. I also think we'll see more companies getting smart about having all of their fabrication eggs in one of two baskets (samsung or tsmc) both within a 500 mile radius circle in the south china sea. Intel has had 4 years of technical debt on it's fabrication side, negative stock pressure from the vacuum created by AMD and Nvidia, and is still managing to be profitable. I think the market (and analysts like this) are all throwing the towel in on the one company that has quite a lot to gain at this point after losing a disproportionate amount of share value and market.

It is not a good long term strategy: The winds of politics may change, politicians may set more terms (labour and environment), foreign market access may become politicized too (US politicians will have to sell chips like they sell airplanes on foreign trips).

If an activist hedge fund got to run the show, it means that they could get these passive shareholders on their side or to abstain.

You're right: AMD wasn't competitive for an incredibly long time and ARM wasn't really meaningful for a long time. That's the perfect situation for some MBAs to come into. You start thinking that you're wasting money on R&D. Why create something 30% better this year when 10% better will cost a lot less and your competitors are so far behind that it doesn't matter? It's not that Intel should have seen AMD coming or should have seen ARM coming. It's that Intel should have understood that just because you have weak enemies today doesn't mean that you have an unassailable castle. Intel should have been smart enough to understand that backing off of R&D would mean giving up the moat they'd created. Even if it looked like no one was coming for their crown at the moment, you need to understand that disinvestment doesn't get rewarded over the long-run. Intel should have understood that trying to be cheap about R&D and extract as much money from customers wasn't a long-term strategy. It wasn't the strategy that built them into the dominant Intel we knew.

Ryzen I will give you is a surprise, but in a healthy competive market, \"the competition outengineered us this time\" _should_ be a potential outcome. IMO the interesting question is basically whether Intel could have done anything differently.

Had Intel adopted the molten tin of EUV, the cycle of failure would have been curtailed. Hats off to SMIC for the DUV 7nm which they produced so quickly. They likely saw quite a bit of failed effort. And before we discount ARM, we should remember that Acorn produced a 32-bit CPU with a 25k transistor count. The 80386 was years later, with 275k transistors.

The first ARM CPU competed against the 286, and did win. The 386 was a big deal though. First, software was very expensive at the time, and the 386 allowed people to keep their investments. Second, it really was a powerful chip. It allowed 11mips vs ARM3’s 13, but the 486 achieved 54mips. ARM6 only hit 28mips. It’s worth noting that the 386 also used 32bit memory addressing and a 32 bit bus while ARM was 26bit addressing with a 16 bit bus. reply chasil 6 hours agorootparentAt the same time, it had unquestioned performance dominance until ARM made the decision for embedded.

In Japan the best award you can get for having an outstanding company in terms of profit, topline, quality, free-cash, people, and all the good measures is the Deming Award. Deming was our guy (an American) but we Americans in management didn't take him seriously enough. The Japanese to their credit did ... ran with it and made it into their own thing in a good way. The Japanese took 30% of the US auto market in our own backyard. Customers knew Hondas, Toyotas cost more but were worth every dollar. They resold better too. (Yes some noise about direct government investment in Japanese companies by the government was a factor too, but not the chief factor in the long run). We Americans got it \"explained to us.\" We thought we were handling it. Nah, it was BS. But we eventually got our act together. Our Deming award is the Malcolm Baldridge award. Today, unfortunately the Japanese economy isn't rocking like it was the 80s and early 90s. And Toyota isn't the towering example of quality it once was. I think -- if my facts are correct --- they went too McDonalds and got caught up in lowering price in their materials, and supply chain with bad effects net overall. So things ebb and flow. The key thing: is management through action or inaction allowing stupid inbred company culture to make crappy products?

This is apocalyptic scale incompetence. reply zer00eyz 9 hours agoprev>>> Notice what is happening here: TSMC, unlike its historical pattern, is not keeping (all of its) 5nm capacity to make low-cost high-margin chips in fully-depreciated fabs; rather, it is going to repurpose some amount of equipment — probably as much as it can manage — to 3nm, which will allow it to expand its capacity without a commensurate increase in capital costs. This will both increase the profitability of 3nm and also recognizes the reality that is afflicting TSMC’s 7nm node: there is an increasingly large gap between the leading edge and “good enough” nodes for the vast majority of use cases. My understanding is that 5nm has been and continues to be \"problematic\" in terms of yield. The move to 3nm seems to not be afflicted by as many issues. There is also a massive drive to get more volume (and a die shrink will do that), due to the demands of all things ML.

All within a large but manageably hot crystal. Space and power in datacenters are at a premium; packing so many pretty decent cores into one CPU allows to run a ton of cloud VMs on a physically compact server. AMD EPYC, by the way, follows the same dtatcenter-oriented pattern. reply noopl 9 hours agoprevAs someone that doesn’t really understand the space and stuff that the article is talking about, I was surprised that “Apple Silicon” didn’t appear here since from my perspective having used both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs, it’s a huge “wow” change. Was Apple leaving and Apple Silicon Macs being so incredibly better than Intel ones not actually a big deal for Intel? reply timschmidt 9 hours agoparentApple had been sandbagging the Intel chips for several generations of macbook with anemic cooling solutions, poor thermal throttling curves, and fans that wait until the last moment to turn on. To the extent that the fastest CPUs available in Macbook Pros did not outperform lower models, because both became thermally saturated. When properly cooled, the Intel silicon tends to perform a lot better. Additionally, both Intel and AMD manufacturer CPUs for HEDT and servers which are far beyond anything Apple is fabricating at the moment. Apple has no response to Epyc, Threadripper, or higher end Xeon. Similarly, Apple has no equivalent to Intel, AMD, and Nvidia discrete GPUs. Apple made a quality cell phone chip, and managed to exploit chiplets and chip-to-chip interconnects to double and quadruple it into a decent APU. But it's still an APU, just one segment addressed by current x86 designs. reply jdewerd 8 hours agorootparentAbsolutely ridiculous. No, Apple did not juice the M1 by giving it better cooling than x86. Quite the opposite, they took a big chunk of their design+process wins to the bank and exchanged them for even cooler and quieter operation because that's what they wanted all along. Cool and quiet was a deliverable. It's absurd to point out that apple could have gotten higher perf from x86 at higher power as if it's some kind of win for intel. Yes, obviously they could have, that's true of every chip ever. They could take it even further and cool every macbook with liquid nitrogen and require lugging around a huge tank of the stuff just to read your email! They don't, because that's dumb. Apple goes even further than most laptop manufacturers and thinks that hissing fans and low battery life are dumb too. This leads them to low power as a design constraint and what matters is what performance a chip can deliver within that constraint. That's the perspective from which the M1 was designed and that's the perspective from which it delivered in spades. reply timschmidt 8 hours agorootparentMaybe it's not clear to everyone... hot transistors waste more power as heat. It's a feedback loop. And it doesn't require liquid nitrogen to nip in the bud. Running the chip hot benefits no one. Kicking on a fan, and racing to idle without throttling would use less battery power. I'm not sure what's so upsetting about the assertion that chips composed of a similar number of transistors, on a similar process node, cooled similarly, might function similarly. Because when all variables are controlled for, that's what I see. reply sangnoir 7 hours agorootparentprev> Absolutely ridiculous. No, Apple did not juice the M1 by giving it better cooling than x86.

But then does Apple deserve credit for TSMC's process advantage? AMD was never stuck in the way Intel was, and they have had the performance crown since for most kinds of workloads. I suppose Apple figured if they were going to switch chip vendors again it might as well be to themselves. reply whynotminot 7 hours agorootparentTrue, it's not just a story of Apple besting Intel. AMD has been beating them too. Rough recent history for Intel. I agree that Apple figured if they were going to switch, they should just go ahead and switch to themselves. But the choice was really to switch to either themselves or AMD. Sticking with Intel at the time was untenable. 14nm is certainly a big part of that story, and I'm glad you at least finally recognize there was a serious problem. If Intel had been able to deliver on their node shrink roadmap, perhaps Apple never would have felt the need to switch--or may have at least delayed those plans. Who knows, that's alternate history speculation at this point. The article in question is about Intel potentially getting back to some level of process parity, perhaps even leadership. I'm looking forward to that because I think a competitive market is important. But pretending Intel's laptop processors weren't garbage for most of the last 8 or so years is kind of living in an alternate reality. reply timschmidt 7 hours agorootparentI think a lot has happened in Intel land since Apple folk stopped paying attention, as well. Intel still has a lot of work to do to catch up to AMD, but they have been fairly consistently posting gains in all areas. Apple really doesn't have a power advantage other than that granted by their process node at this point, against either AMD or Intel. AMD has seemingly delayed the Strix Halo launch because it wasn't necessary to compete at the moment. And Qualcomm is taking the same path Apple has, but is willing to sell to anyone, and as a result has chips in all standalone VR headsets other than Apple's. It remains to be seen if Apple is willing or able to scale their architecture to something workstation class (the last Intel Mac Pro supported 1.5TB of ram, it's easy to build a 4TB Epyc workstation these days). reply cookingmyserver 8 hours agorootparentprev> When properly cooled, the Intel silicon tends to perform a lot better. Of course, but the average Joe does not want to wear ear protection when running their laptop. Nor do they want the battery to last 40 minutes or have it be huge brick, or have to pour liquid nitrogen on it to not get it to not thermal throttle. Apple innovated by making chips that fit the form and function most people need in their personal devices. They don't need to be the absolute fastest, but innovation isn't solely tied to the computing power of a processor. It make sense that Intel excels in the market segment where people do need to wear ear protection to go near their products. If they need to crank in an extra 30 watts to achieve their new better compute then so be it. We don't know the specifics of the conversations between Apple and Intel. Hopefully for Intel it was just the fact that they didn't want to innovate for personal computing processors and not that they couldn't. reply timschmidt 8 hours agorootparentIt seems like you think I'm trying to dunk on Apple. I am not. Apple Silicon is a great first showing for them. Performance simply isn't better than Ryzen APUs running in the same power envelope. And power usage is what you'd expect of silicon running on the latest node. Further, some of Apple's choices - bringing memory on package, only two display outputs - caused regressions for their users compared to the previous Intel offerings. I wouldn't call what Apple did innovation - they followed predictable development trajectories - more integration. They licensed ARM's instruction set, Imagination's PowerVR GPU, most of the major system busses (PCIe, Thunderbolt, USB 3, Displayport, etc), they bonded chiplets together with TSMC's packaging and chip-to-chip communication technologies, and they made extensions (like optional x86 memory ordering for all ARM instructions which removes a lot of the work of emulation). Incidentally, Apple kicked off it's chip design efforts by purchasing PA Semi. Those folks had all the power management chip design expertise already. But again, it's been a good first showing for Apple. I think they were smart to ship on-package DRAM in a consumer device. Now is about the right time for the CPU to be absorbing DRAM, as can be seen by AMD's 3D VCache in another form. And it's cool for Apple folks to have their own cool thing. Yay y'all. But I've run Linux for 20 years, I've run Linux on every computer I can get my hands on in that time, and through that lens, Apple silicon performs like any x86 APU in a midrange laptop or desktop. And as regards noise, I never hear the fans on my 7800x3D / 3090Ti, and it is very very noticeably faster than my M1 Mac. Apple Silicon's great, it's just for laptops and midrange desktops right now. reply charrondev 7 hours agorootparentSomehow you are comparing Apple’s first gen laptop/iPad chip to a a desktop setup requiring 10x the power consumption and 10x the physical size (for the chips and all the cooling required).

Apple \"sandbagging\" was them desperately trying to get a poor Intel product to work in laptops they wanted to be thin and light.

I think you're the one doing the brand-oriented thinking here. reply timschmidt 7 hours agorootparent> nothing in Intel's lineup at the time was any good for a laptop. You leave no room for nuance here, friend. And somehow I doubt you're familiar with every single one of Intel's tens of thousands of SKUs over decades. Intel has made a lot of CPUs. They're in lots of laptops. You might consider your wording if you're not trying to be corrected. reply whynotminot 7 hours agorootparentPlease correct me then. I'm willing to learn about the Intel laptop chip that Apple could have used to achieve M1 performance and efficiency at the time they switched. You're right that I am not familiar with every one of Intel's SKUs they produced at the time. reply timschmidt 6 hours agorootparentM1 was released in 2020, that puts it in line with Tiger Lake and Comet Lake, for which I'm seeing 7 different SKUs at 7W TDP. The fastest of which seems to be the Core i7 1180G7, which seems to perform almost as well as the M1 while using about half as much power: https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/intel-core-i7-1180g7-v... Just the first example I grabbed. Intel made quite a few more chips in the 15W and higher envelopes, still under M1's ~20W TDP. I didn't check their embedded SKUs yet. Nor enterprise. reply nemothekid 6 hours agorootparentIt's hard for me to square your statements with actual real world products. The Core i7 1180G7 was the CPU in the ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 2 (IIRC), and that laptop got half the battery life of an M2 Pro and a third of the battery life of the M1 air. TDP doesn't seem to be the whole story - the datasheet is one thing, but I've yet to see a reviewer get 30 hours from an Intel laptop. reply timschmidt 6 hours agorootparentFor sure there's interesting stuff to talk about here. Intel allows OEMs a lot of configuration with regard to TDP and various ways to measure chip temp accounting for thermal mass of the cooling solution and skin temperature of the device. Many OEMs screw it up. Even the big ones. Lenovo and Apple included. Screen backlight usually has as much to say about battery life as the CPU does. And it's hard to deny Apple's advantage of being fully vertically integrated. Their OS only needs to support a finite number of hardware configurations, and they are free to implement fixes at any layer. Most of my PC laptops make choices which use more power in exchange for modularity and upgradeability as well, like using SODIMMs for ram, and m.2 or SATA removeable storage, all of which consume more power than Apple's soldered on components. reply whynotminot 6 hours agorootparentprevDid you make a mistake in your comparison link? Because I've been looking at it for a few minutes now and I don't get it. It doesn't support your contention that Intel was making comparable chips at the time to the M1, I'll say that at the least. reply timschmidt 6 hours agorootparentI guess we're reading different graphs. The one I'm seeing shows Intel producing 70% of the performance with 35% of the power of an M1. That's... checks math... better performance per watt, and lower overall power consumption. If you want more performance, you are free to step up to a 15W version which outperforms the M1 at 70% of it's TDP. reply whynotminot 6 hours agorootparentI think I have a better sense of some of the misunderstanding here. I think you're taking Intel's TDP figures as honest and straightforward, when they really truly aren't. Anandtech has talked about some of Intel's TDP shenanigans before, even for Tiger Lake: https://www.anandtech.com/show/16084/intel-tiger-lake-review... reply timschmidt 5 hours agorootparentI wouldn't call them shenanigans. At least Intel publishes numbers (Apple does not). There are simply a lot of power states Intel CPUs are capable of engaging, and many configuration options about when and under what circumstances to do so. Much of this is configurable by the OEM and is not hard-set by Intel, or even under Intel's control after the processor leaves the fab. The Anandtech article seems to indicate that it's perfectly possible to run this Intel CPU within the advertised 7W TDP, and that it can also be allowed to turbo up to 50W, which I'm sure most OEMs enable. My favorite OEMs provide the knobs to adjust these features. reply timschmidt 8 hours agorootparentprevIntel makes plenty of chips in the 15W and even 5W envelopes to this day. MSI just built a gaming handheld with one. reply whynotminot 8 hours agorootparentAt those envelopes they are nowhere near as good as what Apple makes. Even if Intel makes a thing that doesn't mean it's actually any good. I had some of those Intel ULV parts back in the day. They sucked. reply timschmidt 7 hours agorootparentI'm not sure what you had back in the day, but even Intel's E cores these days are spritely. Gone are the days of slow Atom cores. Pretty sure an equivalently clocked Intel E core of today beats the fastest Intel core ever shipped in an Apple product. reply whynotminot 7 hours agorootparentNeither here nor there--when Apple needed Intel to ship a decent, performant core that didn't overheat and chew through battery life, they could not. Apple switched to their own silicon, and life for their customers has radically improved. Maybe Intel has a great E Core now. Good for them if they do. reply timschmidt 7 hours agorootparentIt sounds like Apple just wanted to vertically integrate, to me. Which is a fine reason to do something.

Apple silicon macs run at 100+ degrees at load. Apple would rather run their chips hot than turn on the fans, which may or may not be justified. We don't really see chips dying from high temps, especially for typical workloads a casual user would use. reply gryn 8 hours agorootparentJust wait for them to get a little older and you'll probably have a wave of motherboards dying in the future like what happened with the MBPs from around 2011 - 2013 with apple denying it for years until the threats of class action lawsuits before offering replacements with other motherboards that also fail. reply doublepg23 8 hours agorootparentprevThat’s pretty common for modern CPUs.

If it did, I’d consider it a downgrade. reply jeffbee 7 hours agorootparentI don't think Apple \"sabotaged\" them but it is true that the M1 series came with very different thermal design parameters than the terminal Intel models. Apple's Intel laptops would ramp chip power to the max as soon as anything happened. Apple's M1 ramps very, very slowly, dwelling for hundreds of milliseconds at each voltage before stepping up.

It’s a good example of the foundry model that the article is talking about. reply jsheard 9 hours agorootparentNot only do they manufacture Apple Silicon, but Apple usually buys out the first runs of their new processes so they have a head-start against even other TSMC customers. I believe every 3nm wafer that TSMC makes is still going to Apple, hence the just-released Qualcomm SD8G3 flagship chip still being made on TSMC 4nm. reply timschmidt 9 hours agorootparentNvidia's AI $trillions may influence this arrangement in the near future. In the recent past Nvidia has bid Samsung against TSMC in attempts to save costs, but Apple's strategy works well for as long as one foundry has a process advantage. reply mdasen 7 hours agorootparentI think Apple's advantages are that it has a lot of cash and a very predictable business. I'm not arguing that Nvidia doesn't have a good business, but it seems to be a bit less predictable and a bit less regular than Apple's business. Apple really knows how many chips it's going to want years in advance. Even if Nvidia also wants TSMC's latest process, that could work to Apple's advantage. Right now it's looking like Apple might end up with TSMC's 3nm process for 18 months. If Apple and Nvidia split the initial 2nm capacity, it could be 3+ years before AMD and Qualcomm can get to 2nm. If Nvidia launches the RTX 50 series in late 2024 or early 2025 on TSMC's 3nm (which seems to be the rumor), what does that do for availability for AMD and Qualcomm? Maybe what we'll see going forward is Apple taking the capacity for the first year and Nvidia taking the capacity for the second year leaving AMD and Qualcomm waiting longer. That would certainly benefit Apple. Apple isn't competing against Nvidia. If Nvidia uses up TSMC capacity leaving Apple's actual competitors at a bigger disadvantage, that's pretty great for Apple. reply frankchn 6 hours agorootparentprevThe chips Nvidia requires are a lot bigger (>800 mm2 sometimes) and they are much more expensive to make on a cutting edge process with relatively low yields compared to the 100-150 mm2 chips Apple wants for its Axx iPhone chips. reply Rapzid 8 hours agorootparentprevNot a good deal for consumer IMHO.

Firstly, Apple built experience over a decade designing and building the chips, taking over more and more of the design and IP. Then making these chips at a Intel competitor TSMC, who has a different business model to Intel. Apple were also willing to compromise. The first years had weird experiences for customers with Rosetta, broken apps and Macs that could only drive a single external monitor and connect to few devices. Yet we clearly saw the power efficiency from the better foundry tech at TSMC, coupled with decade of saving watts for mobile phone batteries. reply ken47 7 hours agoprevThis reminds me of the situation at Boeing, albeit w/ less fatal consequences. For a long time, it's been a company that has focused on maximizing profits through \"innovative\" business practices, first and foremost, rather than innovative R&D. It's completely unsurprising that Intel has been struggling lately against its genuinely inventive competition. reply oldgradstudent 6 hours agoprev> I thought that Krzanich should do something similar: Intel should stop focusing its efforts on being an integrated device manufacturer (IDM) — a company that both designed and manufactured its own chips exclusively — and shift to becoming a foundry that also served external customers. That would only work if Intel has a competitive foundry. Intel produces very high margin chips. Can it be competitive with TSMC in low margin chips where costs must be controlled? The rumors I've heard (not sure about their credibility) is that Intel is simply not competitive in terms of costs and yields. And that's even before considering it doesn't really have an effective process competitive with TSMC. It's easy to say it should become a foundry, it's much harder to actually do that. reply Sparkyte 4 hours agoprevYou can not innovate without competition.

How true it that there is an actual advantage vs TSMC? reply mdasen 7 hours agoparentIt all depends on timing. TSMC is also working on backside power delivery. Intel's roadmap looks great. However, I'm skeptical of whether they're actually meeting that roadmap. Meteor Lake was launched last month using Intel 4, but it looks like Intel 4 has lower transistor density than TSMC's 5nm. Intel 3 is listed on their roadmap as second-half 2023, but we've yet to see any Intel 3 parts. Realistically, there won't be too much of an advantage for Intel. It's pretty clear that even when Intel ships things, they aren't shipping these new nodes in volume. Intel 4 is only being used for some laptop processors and they're even using TSMC's 5nm and 6nm processes for the graphics and IO on those chips. They canceled the desktop version of Meteor Lake so desktops are staying on Intel 7 for now. Intel's latest server processors launched last month are also Intel 7. If Intel were able to get a year or two ahead of TSMC, then I could see a nice advantage. However, it looks like Intel's a year behind its roadmap and even being a year behind they're only shipping laptop parts (and not even able to fab the whole chip themselves). But past success/failure doesn't predict the future. Maybe Intel will be shipping 20A with backside power in 2024 and it'll be 2025 before TSMC gives Apple a 2nm chip with backside power. But given that we haven't seen them shipping Intel 3 and they haven't taken Intel 3 off their roadmap, I'm going to be a bit skeptical. Intel is doing way better than they had been doing. However, I've yet to see something convincing that they're doing better than TSMC. That's not to say they aren't going to do better than TSMC, but at this point Intel is saying \"we're going to jump from slightly worse than 5nm (Intel 4) to 2nm in a year or less!\" Maybe Intel is doing that well, but it's a tall ask. TSMC launched 5nm in 2020 and 3 years later got to 3nm. It doesn't take as long to catch up because technology becomes easier over time, but Intel is kinda claiming it can compress 5-6 years worth of work into a single year. Again, maybe Intel has been pouring its resources into 20A and 18A and maybe some of it is more on ASML and maybe Intel has been neglecting Intel 4 and Intel 3 because it knows it's worth putting its energy toward something actually better. But it also seems reasonable to have a certain amount of doubt about Intel's claims. I'd love for Intel to crush its roadmap. Better processors and better competition benefit us all. But I'm still wondering how well that will go. TSMC seems to be having a bit of trouble with their 3nm process. 2024's flagship Android processors will remain on 4nm and it looks like the 2024 Zen 5 processors will be 4nm as well (with 3nm parts coming in 2025). So it looks like 3nm will basically just be Apple until 2025 which kinda indicates that TSMC isn't doing wonderfully with its 3nm process. Android processors moved to 5nm around 6 months after Apple did, but it looks like they'll move to 3nm around 18 months after Apple. But just because TSMC isn't doing great at 3nm doesn't mean Intel will face similar struggles. It just seems likely that if TSMC (a company that has been crushing it over the past decade) is facing higher struggles at 3nm, it's a bit of wishful thinking to believe Intel won't face similar struggles at 3nm and below. reply mmaunder 6 hours agoprevIntel is just like Boeing: A company with legendary engineering roots taken over by myopic financial engineers who can’t think further than next quarters stock price, which is their only measure, their only target, and to which all their bonuses are attached. reply kortilla 5 hours agoparentThis is oversimplified and actually underplays how serious the issue is.

Spectre/meltdown barely registers on the radar of issues that Intel has. People are still mostly buying Intel CPUs in laptops, desktops, and servers, and the N100 seems to be gaining ground in the Raspberry Pi space. Maybe it gave an opening for AMD in some markets, but Intel really hasn’t seen some huge tarnished reputation because of it. The far greater threats are that they missed the phone market, and are missing the GPU/AI market. Those are entirely new markets where growth would happen, instead of the mostly fixed size of the current CPU market where the same players are just trading small percentage points. reply kbutler 7 hours agoprevAndy Grove's philosophy was \"Only the paranoid survive\".

I've heard this from a number of people who are comparing the x13s or new mac's with their 14nm intel that has a discrete nvidia gpu (which is eating another 10W+) from 2017/8 or so. I have a pile of laptops including the x13s, and that part burns a good ~30W for a couple minutes, while running ~30% (or worse) slower, then thermally throttles and drops another ~30% in performance. For light browsing it manages to stay under 5W and gets 10h from its 50Wh battery. This is also doable on just about any AMD or Mac laptop. The AMD machine I'm typing this on tells me I have more than 12 hours remaining and i'm sitting at 81% battery (67Wh). And this machine is a good 3x faster compiling code, or running simple benchmarks like speedometer when its plugged in or allowed to burn 35W. Except it also has a fan that turns on when its under heavy load to keep it from thermally throttling. Yes the x13s is cute, it is a thin/light laptop and is probably the first windows on arm machine that isn't completely unusable. But, its going to take another leap or two to catch-up with current top of the line machines.

Theobald & Huai-Ti Lin Nature Communications volume 15, Article number: 689 (2024) Cite this article 1656 Altmetric Metrics details Abstract Explanations of why nocturnal insects fly erratically around fires and lamps have included theories of “lunar navigation” and “escape to the light”. However, without three-dimensional flight data to test them rigorously, the cause for this odd behaviour has remained unsolved. We employed high-resolution motion capture in the laboratory and stereo-videography in the field to reconstruct the 3D kinematics of insect flights around artificial lights. Contrary to the expectation of attraction, insects do not steer directly toward the light. Instead, insects turn their dorsum toward the light, generating flight bouts perpendicular to the source. Under natural sky light, tilting the dorsum towards the brightest visual hemisphere helps maintain proper flight attitude and control. Near artificial sources, however, this highly conserved dorsal-light-response can produce continuous steering around the light and trap an insect. Our guidance model demonstrates that this dorsal tilting is sufficient to create the seemingly erratic flight paths of insects near lights and is the most plausible model for why flying insects gather at artificial lights.

Krapp & Stephane Viollet Odour motion sensing enhances navigation of complex plumes Article 09 November 2022 Nirag Kadakia, Mahmut Demir, … Thierry Emonet Introduction The interaction between flying insects and artificial light, is such a common occurrence that it has inspired the saying “drawn like a moth to a flame”1. Artificial light is an ancient method to trap insects, with the earliest written records dating back to the Roman Empire around 1 AD2,3. Efforts to improve light trap efficiency have generated many observations about nocturnal phototaxis, including phenomenological data on the effects of wavelength, the moon, sky brightness, and weather4,5. Consequently, several qualitative models of how insects gather at light have been proposed6. Some of the most popular theories are: (1) Insects are drawn to light through an escape mechanism, directing their flight toward it as they might aim for a gap in the foliage7. (2) Insects use the moon as a celestial compass cue to navigate, and mistakenly use artificial light sources instead8. (3) Thermal radiation from light sources is attractive to flying insects9. (4) The sensitive night-adapted eyes of insects are blinded by artificial lights, causing them to fly erratically or crash, and trapping them near light sources10,11. Understanding how insects interact with artificial light is particularly important amid modern increases in light pollution that are a growing contributor to insect declines12,13. Compared to the abundance of hypotheses, the kinematic data required to test their predictions are exceedingly rare11,14. The thermal radiation model has been conclusively found to be flawed15, while other models continue to be proposed today16,17. Why has a conclusive answer evaded us? In part, because 3D tracking of small flying objects in low light is technically challenging, and necessary tools did not exist18. That did not stop researchers from attempting innovative experiments, such as attaching moths to polystyrene boats11. However, in-flight 3D flight trajectory and orientation measurements have remained difficult19,20. We leveraged advances in camera hardware and tracking software to consider the sensory requirements for insect flight control, and how artificial light may disrupt them. Flying animals need a reliable way to determine their orientation with respect to the external world, especially with reference to the direction of gravity. Throughout the long evolutionary history of insect flight, the brightest part of the visual field has been the sky, and thus it is a robust indicator of which way is up. This is true even at night, especially at short wavelengths ( 5° from the median (~90°), the frame was removed from the trajectory. These instances reflected either poor tracking or accidental mislabelling. Recordings of up to 30 min consisted of many smaller sections with variable marker visibility. Individual trajectories were excised if the marker frame was not visible for longer than 0.5 seconds. This kept closely time-linked trajectories together despite small gaps but separated different bouts of flight around the light. When analysing the data, we used separate flags to distinguish 6 DoF data (in which all three markers of the rigid-frame were tracked) from 3 DoF data in which only one marker needed to be visible. While we required 6 DoF data to distinguish orientation of the insect, we could still use 3 DoF data to demonstrate flight speed and the position of the insect around the light. Given that insects would frequently settle on the light or walls and occasionally walk around at low speeds, we filtered out any data below 0.3 ms−1 to avoid including data in which the insects were not in flight. To quantify the insect’s body orientation, we used a composite of non-additive bank and pitch angles relative to the horizontal plane. For pitch angle, we measured the angle between the animal’s long body axis (from posterior to anterior) and the global vertical. To quantify bank angle, we calculated the magnitude of the angle between the insect’s lateral vector (aligning left to right laterally across the animal’s body) and the horizontal plane. It should be noted that this methodology reflects around the horizontal plane (maximum bank is limited to 90°), meaning that an insect completely inverted upside down would score the same as one the correct side up. For our motion-capture recordings, this was not of practical relevance, as near-inverted animals would obscure their markers from the camera system above. Laboratory video recordings To test the effects of artificial light on smaller insects than those used in our motion capture recordings, we caught Honeybees (Apis mellifera) and an assortment of Diptera & other Hymenoptera from the grounds of Imperial College London. We also collected small insects arriving at a light trap in Cambridge, UK. These crepuscular/nocturnal taxa included Trichoptera & Ephemeroptera (see Table 4 for full taxonomic breakdown). Captured diurnal insects were recorded in experiments within 1 h of capture (14:00 to 18:00). Nocturnal light trapped insects were recorded the following day within 24 hrs. We collected Drosophila spp. from a local compost heap (Cambridge, UK), using them within 48 h of capture. Drosophila spp. were given small sections of banana on which to feed before recordings were made. We contained these insects within a Perspex-sided cube 20 cm on a side (Fig. 4d). A small portion of damp cartridge paper in one corner of the box provided sufficient humidity that most tested insects survived the experiments and were able to be released afterward. On one side of the cube, we placed two infrared LED panels facing through the centre of the box (850 nm Splenssy 96 LED array). The closest wall of the cube was covered in thin paper, diffusing the transmission of the infra-red light to create a near-even backdrop against which insects could be silhouetted. We placed UV (TBE Lighting L276, 9w) or white LED bulbs (QNINE B22-G45 6000k, 6w) above and below the cube, having independent control of each via toggle switches. We positioned a high-speed camera (Phantom v211, Vision Research, with 50 mm Nikon F-mount lens) to look through one wall of the cube at the diffuse infra-red illumination. We recorded the flight behaviour at 1000 fps. Switching between the lights caused insects to congregate either at the top of the container (when the light came from above) or at the bottom (when light came from below). Periodically switching between the lights was generally sufficient to elicit flight responses. We also found lightly tapping the box a reliable method for generating flight recordings, especially in Drosophila spp. who did not congregate around the light source. Light switching For our light switching experiments, we hung two UV LED lights (TBE Lighting L276, 9w) from a metal frame (3 m tall) outdoors in Cambridge, UK (Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Movie 6). The lights were thus suspended 2 metres from the ground. We arranged a single high-speed camera (Chronos 2.1, Kron Technologies, with IR filter removed) facing directly upward beneath the lights. Either side of the camera we arranged two IR illuminators (850 nm Splenssy 96 LED array) facing upward, which picked out flying insects against the dark sky above. We recorded behaviour at either 500 or 250 fps. We switched on one of the lights and waited for wild insects to begin orbiting behaviour. We also introduced wild-caught diurnal species by releasing them individually. When an insect was orbiting beneath one of the lights, we swapped to the other light using a manually toggled switch. After a short interval (500 °/s) substantially between samples, while retaining sufficient samples for statistical power. For testing the nonuniformity of our circular distributions (e.g., for horizontal velocity relative to the light) we used the Rayleigh z-test. This test assumes that non-uniformity is unimodal. However, when concerning insects travelling or tilting around a light source, our expected distributions are bimodal (insects can travel both clockwise and anticlockwise around the light whilst orbiting). To correct for this effect, we used an angle doubling procedure. All velocity bearings from the light (0°–360°) were doubled. We then subtracted 360° from any doubled angles >360°. This resulted in the bimodal clockwise-anticlockwise orbiting forming a single unimodal concentration. When testing the turning direction of insects near point sources versus those near diffuse sources, we used a chi-square test. For each condition, created a contingency table with two variables: light direction (left or right), and turning direction (left or right). Trajectory data from each condition was subsampled to 10 Hz, as in other trajectory analyses. Light and environmental measurements We measured the spectra of the two UV lights (LED bulb) and the UV Tube used in the field and lab experiments. We also measured the spectrum of the reflected light inside the laboratory tent. We used a calibrated FLMT03251 Flame Ocean Optics Spectrophotometer to take relative irradiance measurements. An Integration Time of 40 ms, with 10 Scans to average and electric dark correction enabled, and no nonlinearity correction enabled, with a Boxcar width: 0 were used. The light sources were placed a meter from the light and tilted to ensure the sensor was not saturated. For the dark sky measurements, we used the Environmental Light Field setup (https://github.com/sciencedjinn/elf) as described in52. We used a Nikon D850 with a Sigma 8 mm/F3.5 lens to take a dark calibration as recommended with a 20 s exposure time. A Govee H5072 humidity and temperature hygrometer was used to take measurements in the 2021 field experiments. Wind speed was recorded using a handheld anemometer. The Ambient Weather WS-2902 was used to measure humidity, temperature, and wind speed for the experiments in 2023. Simulating dorsal tilting To mimic the dorsal turning responses, we introduced a proportional controller that pulled the dorsal axis of our simulated insect towards the direction of the light source (Fig. 6a). The proportional controller caused the insect’s body to rotate with an angular speed proportional to the error between the dorsal axis and the line-of-sight (LOS) vector to the light source. We termed the gain on this controller k1, in units of s−1. We did not attempt to capture realistic flight dynamics but merely to provide an approximation of the observed dorsal tilting phenomenon. We implemented a second controller to pull the dorsal axis back towards the true vertical with a gain k2. This stabilising controller represented active and passive mechanisms in the insect’s flight system that may orient the insect right-side-up. We included this based on our observation that S. striolatum flying in total darkness still retains some degree of correct body attitude. Finally, we introduced a third controller that pulled the longitudinal body axis of the insect towards its velocity vector. This accounts for the active and passive effects of an insect’s body tending to remain head-on to its direction of travel. Thus, the planar formulation of the steering embodied by the simulated insect is given by: $$\\dot{\\theta } \\;=\\; {k}_{1}\\theta \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma } \\;=\\; {k}_{2}\\gamma \\\\ \\dot{\\beta } \\;=\\; {k}_{3}\\beta $$ (1) Where θ is the angle between dorsal axis and the LOS to the light, γ is the angle between the dorsal axis and vertical, and β is the angle between the body axis and the velocity. k1, k2, and k3 are the respective proportionality constants for the steering responses. \\({\\dot{\\theta}},\\, {\\dot{\\gamma}},\\, {{{\\rm{and}}}} \\, {\\dot{\\beta}}\\) are the angular velocity steering corrections to the simulated body axes due to the light source direction, passive stability, and velocity direction respectively. The effects of these corrections were summed within each model time step. Drag The aerodynamic drag for flapping insects depends on multiple influences, including speed, wing posture, and body orientation amongst other factors. Here, we adopted a simplistic quadratic air drag model with a form factor c. This constant could be determined by setting the terminal velocity achieved by an insect in freefall. Varying the terminal velocity of the simulated agents allowed for the characterisation of insects of differing sizes. Where c is a constant reflecting the deceleration due to drag for a given airspeed, g is gravitational acceleration (scalar), and vt is the insect’s terminal velocity (scalar). Within our simulations of the three behavioural motifs, we used a constant of 0.80 s−1 with a terminal velocity of 3.5 m/s. This value was chosen as it kept simulated flight-speeds similar to those measured in our motion-capture recordings. During random gain simulations, we set the constant between 0.09 s−1 and 39.24 s−1 (terminal velocity between 10.5 and 0.5 m/s2 respectively). $$c=\\frac{g}{{{v}_{t}}^{2}}$$ (2) Kinematics Simulations were run on a discrete time interval basis. The evolution of the flightpath being governed by the following set of equations. Vectors are written in bold. Firstly: $${{{{{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}=\\left|{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{forw}}}}}}.}\\right|\\widehat{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}}}}}+\\left|{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{dors}}}}}}.}\\right|\\widehat{{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{z}}}}}}}}$$ (3) Where ab is the acceleration generated by the model insect. aforw. and adors. Are the forward and dorsal components of the generated acceleration, and bx and bz are the x and z axes of the insect’s body. The hat notation over the vectors denotes unit vectors. The insect’s body rotates based on the controller described in the ‘Dorsal Tilting’ Section. This acceleration is then combined with gravity and drag to create the net acceleration. $${{{{{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{net}}}}}}}\\left(t\\right)={{{{{\\boldsymbol{g}}}}}}-\\hat{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}}}}(t-1)(c\\left|{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}}}(t-1)}^{2}\\right|)+{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{b}}}}}}}(t)$$ (4) Where anet is the net acceleration on the simulated insect’s body. g is gravitational acceleration, c is the drag constant, and v is the velocity vector of the simulated insect. Here, (t−1) refers to the value from the previous time step. This net acceleration is then added to the body kinematics as follows: $${{{{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}}}\\left(t\\right)={{{{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}}}\\left(t-1\\right)+{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{a}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\\boldsymbol{net}}}}}}}(t)\\varDelta t$$ (5) $${{{{{\\boldsymbol{p}}}}}}\\left(t\\right)={{{{{\\boldsymbol{p}}}}}}\\left(t-1\\right)+{{{{{\\boldsymbol{v}}}}}}(t)\\varDelta t$$ (6) Where p is the position of the simulated insect and Δt is the elapsed time between iterations. Flight simulations There are 4 model parameters to set in the simulation. To recreate example motifs observed in nature, we chose the following parameters: k1 = 15 s−1, k2 = 1 s−1, k3 = 15 s−1, vt = 3.5 ms−1. The forward component of acceleration was 5 ms−2 and the dorsal component was 15 ms−2. For these examples, the Δt per iteration was kept at 10 ms. These parameters were chosen to reflect an insect flying at a relatively low Reynolds number (low terminal velocity), rapid aerial mobility (k values giving rapid reactions like those measured in insect pursuit flight controllers), and with lift and thrust profiles like those observed in our measured data (Supplementary Fig. 3). To avoid conclusions drawn from a well-tuned combination of parameters, we initiated 300 simulations with randomly assigned parameters within reasonable ranges. The ranges were as follows: 0 s−1 < k1 < 20 s−1, 0 s−1 < k2 < 20 s−1, k3 = 15 s−1, 0.5 ms−1 <vt < 10.5 ms−1, 0 ms−2 < aforw. < 10 ms−2, 9.81 ms−2 < adors. < 24.81 ms−2. We determined starting positions at random within the cube defined by +/− 5 m of the light source along each of 3 spatial axes. Initial headings were parallel to the ground plane but started at a random horizontal bearing. Although interactions over the full parameter set are outside the scope of this work, we found the agents in most simulations were entrapped, drawn closer to the light with many entering a stable orbit. Additionally, we adapted our flight simulations to match the assumption of a corrupted celestial compass. This model used the same structure as our dorsal tilting model, but with the light response component of the controller attempting to maintain the light at a fixed egocentric direction (rather than over the dorsum). This arbitrary direction was set by the initial direction of the line-of-sight to the light source, from an egocentric perspective. All other components of the simulation were kept the same as previously discussed.

Keys will often ring in the ultrasonic and poorly mimic the frequencies that a lot of bats use. If you have a population of bats that hunt near you, the bugs will typically just drop. Like, just drop to the ground as fast as they can. They know the sound of hunting bats and your keys may be just close enough to that sound that they think they're being hunted. So they do the best that they can to get out of the way and go with gravity. At least, that's my theory. Fun little thing to do as a bet or with the kiddos. reply trklausss 4 hours agoparentWell you have no sources and you can be full of it.

Do you know how in the summer flies tend to enter rooms and circle the middle of it (where usually the turned off light fixture is)? And they seemingly can't or don't want to find open window to leave the room? At one point for unrelated reasons I replaced light fixture in my room with more than 200W worth of strongest E27 Philips LED lightbulbs I could find (20*1521lumen). Few flies gathered in the middle of the room as usual during the summer day. Then I turned on this light just out of curiosity. The flies dispersed within seconds, suddenly perfectly capable of not flying in circles. I don't think it was the heat or the discomfortably bright light just scaring them off. Even this amount wasn't as bright as sunny day. I think more light and more distributed light (not just comming from the direction of the window) fixed their navigational abilities somehow. reply NL807 6 hours agoparentI have a few theories, these are my own speculations, so I could be wrong. I speculate that the flies rely on a phenomenon called \"optic flow\" for navigating around obstacles. Basically the rate of feature movement perceived on each side of their head/compound eyes determines proximity to objects. Their vision is very blurred, so features need to be quite large, or at least contrasting. If you have a dimly lit room, with white walls, the whole space will appear mostly featureless to the fly, until they get close enough to the wall, and thus fly around in circles. Perhaps they also use a fixed contrasting object as a reference point, like the light fixture (turned off) and return to it if they veer off too far into the \"featureless void\". If you turn on the light, the perceived illumination in the space is inverted. The light makes previously invisible objects around the room more contrasting for them to navigate about and to fly closer, even land. reply bethekind 1 hour agoparentprevI like bright lights as much as anyone else, could you explain how you got a 20x fixture set up in your room? I've heard of 500 watt E38 mogul fixtures, but not 20x mini ones reply darkwater 13 hours agoparentprevThis actually squares with the study, no? I mean, when they are inside - and it's my experience as well - they might take the window as the main source of light and think that's the sky, so they start to fly in circles. reply paiute 13 hours agoparentprevI was under the impression they confuse lights for stars and it messes with them. So if you simulate the sun the probably don’t get confused. You can but red spectrum lights that also are supposed to be bug friendly reply zuzun 12 hours agoparentprevFlies easily fly through the window if it's substantially brighter than the room. reply kevin_thibedeau 13 hours agoparentprevI notice that clouds of gnats will gather at the boundaries between light and shade. Other insects may adopt similar behaviors. reply switch007 5 hours agoparentprevI’m curious: how are those 20 bulbs installed? You got a single fixture with 20 bulbs?? reply dclowd9901 5 hours agorootparentFixture adapter like this maybe? https://a.co/d/iOgDKZf reply codetrotter 14 hours agoprevSo am I understanding correctly that this confirms the common perception they cited: > Insects use the moon as a celestial compass cue to navigate, and mistakenly use artificial light sources instead reply _xerces_ 10 hours agoparentI think a lot of the comments are also missing the fact that the moon is an unreliable means of navigation due it not always being present the whole night (or at all), changes brightness, moves around the sky and can be covered by cloud. It is unlikely then that insects would specifically evolve to use it as a means of navigation. The paper states that it is the general brightness of the sky, even at night, compared to the ground that is the point of reference. So insect point top side at diffuse bright area and bottom side will be parallel to ground. reply conductr 4 hours agorootparentIt seems to me they are using it, but as you mentioned navigation may not be the purpose. There may be none. It may just be that insects that do this congregate and reproduce thus it’s just a mate finding thing that’s evolved. Since insects often have short lives, I’d guess it also explains why they’re always doing it (they need to mate asap). Might also explain why they don’t go directly to the light but eventually end up there circling it erratically, increased odds of bumping into a mate. reply consp 1 hour agorootparentThe paper mentions that the insects enter stall conditions, maybe due to the banked orientations, sometimes and then recover. This would explain erratic behaviour without any mate present. reply mapreduce 13 hours agoparentprevI don't think it confirms that. It seems to be one of the popular theories they investigated. Later they say - \"In both field and lab conditions, insects rarely head directly towards, but consistently fly orthogonal to the light source. This refutes the fundamental premise of an escape response.\" \"An insect should keep a light source at a fixed visual location for maintaining its heading. Switching light position (Supplementary Fig. 5) shows that insects readily hold the light source on either side of the body.\" It makes sense to me. Imagine you were an insect and you would use the moon for navigation. Would you really be flying directly towards moon? No, right? Then how could someone think that insects flying directly towards artificial light source is the basis for the theory that insects use moon as navigational aid? reply SamBam 13 hours agorootparentI think you're misunderstanding GP. This definitely refutes the theory that insects are trying to escape towards the light, because, as the article shows, insects don't head directly for the light, but instead move orthogonal to it. But this doesn't mean they can't use moonlight to help with flying. The theory, as I understand it, is that they use a distant light source -- e.g. the daytime sky -- to maintain altitude. There's no reason they couldn't use the moon to do this too. Again, they would not be flying towards the moon, they'd be keeping the brightest light to their dorsal side. Since the moon is distant, unlike a lamp, this would result in steady flight. I'm not sure that it confirms whether they use the moon or not, but it seems like a possibility. reply CobrastanJorji 8 hours agorootparentOkay, something I'm confused about. \"Dorsal side\" means, as far as I can tell, your back. So if a fly is keeping its dorsal side facing the moon, that means its back is pointing at the moon. When the moon's directly overhead, this makes lots of sense. Fly goes around wherever. But if the moon's low on the eastern horizon, would we expect flies to mostly be facing upwards, and mostly flying west? reply dclowd9901 5 hours agorootparentDoesn’t it just make more sense that they orient their movement in relation to the moon? Doesn’t matter what the specific orientation is — if the moon is 3 inches across and sitting in a room, it’s gonna fuck with the insect’s navigation. reply moffkalast 13 hours agorootparentprevWait, so it could be a parallax thing? The moon is in practical terms infinitely far away, and no matter how far the insect flies it won't budge and stay as a stationary feature to localize by. But do the same with a lamp that's only 3 m away, and keeping it in the same spot can only mean flying around it in circles, towards, or away from it, otherwise it'll move around a lot relative to the insect observer. reply jameshart 12 hours agorootparentThe spiraling in might also be a kind of vertigo response as well. Normally the moon only goes up or down in your field of vision if you’re adjusting your angle - pitching or rolling. But an artificial light source moves up or downwards if you’re changing altitude but maintaining attitude. That would make flying up past the light ‘feel like’ pitching away from it, which might cause autonomic steering responses, similar to inner ear/visual conflicts causing humans to stagger and fall over. reply Retr0id 13 hours agorootparentprevIf your logic is \"keep the brightest light source on your left\", then for a light source that's nearby (as opposed to \"infinitely\" far away, like the moon) you'll end up orbiting it. Depending on your precise navigation logic, you'll either end up with an increasing or decreasing orbit radius. If it decreases, you'll eventually crash into the light source. reply rdtsc 12 hours agorootparentprev> Imagine you were an insect and you would use the moon for navigation. Would you really be flying directly towards moon? No, right? Then how could someone think that insects flying directly towards artificial light source is the basis for the theory that insects use moon as navigational aid? If you're flying parallel to the ground (horizontally), you'd want the moon to be where your back is and you'd have a good change of flying straight. It's like when the kids say that the moon seems to \"follow\" them. \"Dorsal\" means where the top part is, the insect's back, as it were. reply jameshart 12 hours agorootparentWhat’s so special about keeping it ‘where your back is’? The moon is rarely located directly overhead. Wherever it is, keeping it in a fixed relative position will get you going in a straight line. The article talks about the ‘dorsal flight response’ being more about the overall alignment to the sky hemisphere, not the moon specifically. “the brightest part of the visual field has been the sky, and thus it is a robust indicator of which way is up. This is true even at night, especially at short wavelengths ( What’s so special about keeping it ‘where your back is’? Since we're to imagine the grandparent flying around like an insect. I imagined them as person flying but with insect wings. Since we're mammals with eyes pointing straight ahead, as opposed with them being on the side of our heads, we'd need some light sensor on our back to ensure we're flying straight at night and keeping the moon above, as opposed to having to look behind every so often to ensure the moon is still there :-) reply jgilias 13 hours agoparentprevThat’s my understanding too. The way I thought about this before was that normally an insect would ‘keep the moon’ on one side to navigate straight, but artificial light messes that up and they end up spiraling around those light sources. Which seems exactly the behavior that they have demonstrated in the research. reply pavedwalden 13 hours agorootparentI think the moon theory was almost right, but I didn't see any reference to insects keeping the light source to one side or the other. The researchers seem to think that insects orient as if the brightest thing they see is \"up\". reply mapreduce 13 hours agorootparentprev> they end up spiraling around those light sources What I'm struggling to understand is how the insects then reach so close to the artificial light. Why don't they spiral the artificial light from a great distance like 1 metre or 2 metres away? I see the insects hovering like millimetres or centimetres away from artificial light. reply codetrotter 13 hours agorootparentSee this comment by another user ITT: > Wait, so it could be a parallax thing? > The moon is in practical terms infinitely far away, and no matter how far the insect flies it won't budge and stay as a stationary feature to localize by. > But do the same with a lamp that's only 3 m away, and keeping it in the same spot can only mean flying around it in circles, towards, or away from it, otherwise it'll move around a lot relative to the insect observer. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39195508 Seems a reasonable explanation to me :) reply andmonad 7 hours agorootparentprevIf I understand correctly part of the explanation is that when they're flying horizontally they need to compensate for gravity by pushing up, kind of like what planes do. If you put them in a place where there's no gravity with a light floating in the middle of a room they'd orbit the light while also getting closer as they're trying to compensate for gravity, and when you put gravity back I guess that produces the weird orbiting we observe. Haven't seen flying insects since last summer but if I think they kind of lose altitude the closer they get to the light source, which would be when their torso is less horizontally oriented. Also this is just a guess but I imagine the closer they're to the light source and the larger the contrast between bright and dark is, the stronger is their tendency to get locked into the orbiting path as opposed to flying randomly. reply aeternum 9 hours agorootparentprevThe larger the distance, the more it actually works as a navigational source so you won't see those insects since they are navigating just fine. The insects you see are the ones that happen to get too close and thus their nav gets 'jammed'. It's similar to planes navigating by compass. Works great, until you go up to the arctic circle, then you better have another nav source or you too will be flying in circles. reply Berniek 12 hours agoparentprev>Insects use the moon as a celestial compass cue to navigate, and mistakenly use artificial light sources instead I think that was one of the theories being investigated by this research. The paper demonstrates that it is the actual light (of the moon or stars or sun or artificial source) they use to orientate themselves in the horizontal plain BUT that is not navigation. With a \"tilt\" in their orientation they will fly in circles around the light but this tilt also causes inefficiencies in their actual flight mechanism so will cause erratic directional stability as their flight path rapidly changes their spacial relationship to the light source. Whatever their navigation imperative (heat, cold pheromones,smell, sight, sound) will be affected by this spacial relationship instability. reply huydotnet 15 hours agoprevThe dorsum to the light fact is interesting. And now, watching some random moth to the light vids on Youtube makes more sense to me [1]. [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhNpOsTUqzA reply palata 10 hours agoprevWhat about the color? I know it is slightly orthogonal, but the article says: \"This is true even at night, especially at short wavelengths ( The wavelength of our orange LEDs is 610nm, putting them outside of the spectrum visible to must bugs, but still well inside the boundaries of human vision. As a result, most bugs will not congregate around our orange light because they simply don’t know it is there. That colour also feels reminiscent of a camp fire, which I've often thought could be related — a bug wouldn't survive long if it flew into fires. reply wolverine876 10 hours agoparentprevTry different colors at your home! reply palata 10 hours agorootparentWell I was hoping for something more scientific. I read a bit about that, and it seems like insects are more affected by smaller wavelengths (UV/blue rather than yellow/red) and some species polarized light. But then if we know it, why don't we engineer the street lights to not attract insects? reply wolverine876 10 hours agorootparent> Well I was hoping for something more scientific. What is more scientific than testing the hypothesis yourself? That's science; that's its essential joy and spirit and nature.

The only difference, the only barrier, between you and a 'scientist' is that someone else took that step to do it themselves. Tomorrow you could be a scientist - next time you have an idea! You don't have to publish in Nature to be a scientist. Really, I mean that in the best way. I am a scientist every day. It's powerful, it's joyful, it's curious and exploratory (very important parts of your brain to work out, per research by professional scientists), it's extraordinarily practical: Science, by me, has reduced my energy consumption and bill by around (very roughly) 70%. reply dekhn 8 hours agorootparentYou're likely describing citizen science and engineering, which cannot really be considered for publication in Nature. The work here represents many thousands if not millions of hours of accumulated scientific skill in building experiments that are likely to produce useful conclusions, rather than falsely rejecting the null hypothesis. I've worked in citizen science and I have even done some exciting stuff in my garage, which attracted the world's leading researcher in my area of interest. The first thing I'd need to do with my tech is to bring it to his lab and reproduce it on science-grade equipment. then we would need to come up with good hypotheses we could test, and spend an enormous amount of time designing protocols, and debugging lab details. All of that comes before even thinking about writing a manuscript that would be accepted in nature, which is one of the most prestigious journals with enormous readership. I don't want to discourage young folks who want to get into science, but the reality is that the vast majority of real science is dull work, such as requesting money, writing presentations to convince people you're right, and debugging experiments. I'm not defending this as the way it should be, but observing the reality of the situation. I have actually met a very small number of people who managed to turn citizen science into Big Science and get published, but they are a much smaller group than the folks who do bad citizen science in their garages and get attention on sites like Hackaday. reply wolverine876 8 hours agorootparent> You're likely describing citizen science and engineering That's what you are describing. If you read my comments, I am not talking about that (though I don't object to it), and my main point is that science is not defined by the type of work that gets published in journals, or by whatever qualifies as 'citizen science'. reply dekhn 8 hours agorootparentI read all your comments carefully, in detail, before responding. Can you give us some examples of what you mean? I'm struggling to see how somebody on their own could come up with a non-trivial scientific result that was meaningful in any way. reply LeonB 1 hour agorootparent> I'm struggling to see how somebody on their own could come up with a non-trivial scientific result that was meaningful in any way. Richard Feynman at 67, partaking in an inquiry into the space shuttle challenger disaster, dunked some pieces of rubber, taken from a model of the challenger, in ice cold water and observed that they lacked springiness. The full story is fascinating. Other simple, non-rigorous experiments he performed also had meaning and whether they were “non-trivial” is nothing to do with science, that’s political nonsense. There’s a lot of examples of individuals performing simple experiments that are meaningful. ——- https://lithub.com/how-legendary-physicist-richard-feynman-h... reply wolverine876 5 hours agorootparentprev> a non-trivial scientific result that was meaningful in any way I assume you mean non-trivial and meaningful to society and to the progress of human knowledge. My whole point is that those properties are not necessary to doing 'science'. What I do is non-trivial and meaningful to me and sometimes to people I know, to a few people on the Internet, and/or to my community or co-workers. Though sometimes the data is trivial even to me, and still it's a joy, the joy of exploration and curiosity. Also, there are infinite questions beneath the threshold of professional science costs that can be investigated (and some of those are just hyper-local questions). Science doesn't have to be big and globally meaningful. That stuff is very important, but that's not all there is - not nearly. Just do science - just do it and stop debating if and the semantics - do some experimentation, with some hacked objectivity, controls, etc. It's a powerful tool: what you discover when you actually try it, whatever it is, will change your perspective, will raise new questions, and will lift up your mind and spirits, guaranteed. I know so much more about the world than many people, simply by doing a bit of exploration through experimentation. reply RHSman2 4 hours agorootparentHuman curiosity.

It must be that the number of calories required to produce bioluminescence to create this effect must be greater than the calories that could be derived from hunting that way. But if someone else provided that free energy for hunting… reply patall 13 hours agoparentOr you are observing evolution in action. A bioluminescent spider would likely be an easy target for birds or bats. One by the lamp is not because hunters have simply not adapted yet. Or maybe, spider webs used to be enormous and profitable everywhere, only that insects dying globally makes them profitable now only in those light spots. reply wolverine876 10 hours agoparentprevInteresting. I sometimes wonder how they end up near the lights: there wouldn't seem to be a light source at night for most of their evolution. Maybe they used the moon in the background. But is it correct to assume that, if something is naturally possible (e.g., bioluminescence), and provides significant evolutionary advantage, the species will evolve it? If so, why are we the only intelligent ones (so far)? Why didn't chimpanzees, sharing a common ancestor with us 7 million years ago, evolve intelligence? reply xattt 9 hours agorootparentMy guess is that apes with similar interests started socializing because it was enjoyable and more stimulating than hanging out with apes who could not/would not perceive the nuances of the world the same way. reply xattt 9 hours agoparentprevThis spider-webs-covering-lights phenomenon is replaced over and over and over in every Northern Ontario community.

Otherwise, yes. reply Berniek 12 hours agoprevWell one other aspect of this research springs to mind. Most \"bug zapper\" design are wrong. It should consist of a light source and a single grid perpendicular to the light source rather than surrounding the light source. The light source should also be constantly varying to ensure the insects' tilt (and hence their circling behavior) will also change the radius of their circles. reply sschueller 15 hours agoprevSo one could optimize an outdoor light location design to reduce insects? Like for example an outdoor dining terrace? reply bee_rider 14 hours agoparentI’m not sure if there’s interesting optimization to do. Simply: bugs are attracted to light, light=more bugs, no light=fewer bugs. Motion detectors, for example, can make it so that the light is only temporary and you don’t get those moth parties. reply stinos 13 hours agorootparentbugs are attracted to light Isn't the takeaway from this study that they aren't really, but rather that once they happen to come close to it they cannot get away from it anymore? reply joemi 13 hours agorootparentThe effect is the same (for the purposes of an outdoor dining area), and I believe that's what they were referring to.

Light isn't the only thing they're attracted to so you'd have to optimize distance and cover different variables for different bugs. One fun thing you can do is relocate small swarms of bugs with a torch to another light source. So if you're being pestered, turn on a torch... and slowly walk the bugs to a different light source (a distant lamp for example). Then turn off the torch and walk back to where you were. The light will keep them there. reply Simon_ORourke 14 hours agorootparentWould or could that be automated?

I understand better. reply nashashmi 14 hours agoprevI have a feeling the stars are used by insects to navigate in pitch dark environments.

I am not sure if the clouds were there. But I realize I have not seen stars in a long time. reply chankstein38 13 hours agoparentI'd argue that, based on what this paper is discussing at least, it'd be pretty impossible for them to use stars to navigate. I'm not sure what they'd do in pitch dark environments but if they're using either the sun, moon, or artificial light to help them navigate, I highly doubt stars would even register/be detectable to them. reply tzs 13 hours agoparentprevIt depends on what you count as using stars. Insects don’t have good enough eyes to see individual stars, but dung beetles can see the Milky Way and use it for navigation. reply r2_pilot 14 hours agoparentprevI hope you get the opportunity to see them soon. I live in the south and I enjoy them, although the \"seeing\" (astronomy term) is poor here due to the jet stream. reply elpocko 15 hours agoprev> Contrary to the expectation of attraction, insects do not steer directly toward the light. Instead, insects turn their dorsum toward the light, generating flight bouts perpendicular to the source. Under natural sky light, tilting the dorsum towards the brightest visual hemisphere helps maintain proper flight attitude and control. Near artificial sources, however, this highly conserved dorsal-light-response can produce continuous steering around the light and trap an insect. reply nomoreusernames 5 hours agoprevive seen all types of flying animals fly to a light source, and ive observed a family of lizards feed upon the bug who are attracted to the lamp. the parents taught the baby lizards who now are teenagers. once a big grasshopper flew into the light and passed out and a lizard saw it happen but didnt go down and eat it. lights are on at night and cold nights lizards are dumber and lazier than usual. reply tomxor 14 hours agoprev [–] So now we can blame the insects bad attitude rather than our artificial lights. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Follow Click to save this article. You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. Got it Jan 26, 2024,10:21am EST Man pulling red sweater over face GETTY At the onset of the pandemic, we found ourselves at a pivotal crossroads that compelled us to reimagine how we work. This shift was as profound as it was inevitable, marking our turn towards a new direction in reshaping the essence of our ways of working. Work from home has now stabilized at ~30% in the U.S. as of December 2023, which is almost four times pre-pandemic levels, according to a recent paper from the American Economic Association. The paradigmatic shift induced by remote work has enabled businesses to remodel their operational cost structures and redefine new ways of working. Companies are now navigating a landscape that oscillates between in-person, fully remote, and hybrid workforce models, each presenting its unique set of opportunities and challenges. According to a recent research paper published by University of Pittsburgh, compelling evidence suggests that organizations are leveraging Return-To-Office mandates not to enhance firm value, but rather to reassert control and shift blame for poor performance onto employees. Contrary to the belief that RTO boosts company value, the analysis revealed that RTO mandates are more likely in firms with poor recent stock performance and have had no significant impacts on firm profitability or stock-returns. Moreover, a notable drop in employee job satisfaction was observed, further questioning the efficacy of these mandates. Offices across the U.S. are at an all-time occupancy low, and commercial real estate is starting to see an all-time high of almost 20% of unleased space, according to the Wall Street Journal. The reduction in real estate spend has enabled companies to reduce their operating expenses, thereby positively impacting their financial health. This poses the question: Are return-to-work mandates better for the workforce or for business bottom lines? Connecting To All Stakeholders A considerable number of companies continue to grapple with the right model that aligns with the preferences and philosophies of all stakeholders involved - customers, employees, boards, leadership teams, and shareholders. Many companies, albeit reluctantly, were forced to embrace a remote work model during the pandemic, discovering the potential for enhancing productivity while reducing costs for long-term business growth in a virtual environment. Airbnb exemplified this, having navigated an abrupt halt in revenue at the onset of the pandemic to achieving profitability and executing a successful IPO shortly thereafter, all while operating entirely remotely. Airbnb leveraged their learnings to create a unique Live and Work Anywhere program in April 2022, which balanced a blend of remote work and in-person gatherings. The program was a great success because it tied to their business model and promoted remote work for all their stakeholders, including their shareholders, employees, and their customers (guests and hosts). However, CEOs of companies like WebMD continue to poorly communicate demands and convey threats to their employees in 2024 by telling their employees, “Don't mess with us.” The irony in this approach is that some of their products, like their online symptom checker, are tools that help anyone to remotely evaluate their symptoms and determine treatments needed. Why are companies that promote remote services so opposed to enabling remote work, and more importantly, feel the need to threaten their employees? Last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the CEO of L’Oreal insisted that he was certain that remote workers in their organization lacked attachment, passion, and creativity. He went on to explain that remote work was bad for the mental health of employees, according to Business Insider. The Unintended Consequences Mandating in-office attendance raises questions about the resulting employee behaviors and employer reactions. With enforced attendance, mechanisms like badge access tracking have been implemented in several companies. Will these enforcements result in action being taken, thereby losing or reprimanding engaged talent, or will this just be an empty threat? Companies that mandate office attendance for their workers will likely inherently create the opposite effect they intended. This will result in a subculture of employees going in to grab a coffee and then leave (coffee-badging) or share their badges with co-workers (shadow-badging) to meet the mandates. While mandating these extreme return-to-office policies, companies end up restricting their operations to specific geographic locations and are limiting their talent pool to the same boundaries. On the other hand, being completely remote has a direct impact on onboarding new hires into company culture and can sometimes lower engagement and motivation as employees may lose a strong sense of belonging and connection over time. There can also be a disconnect between the desire to work remotely between the leadership teams across various functions within an organization, thereby resulting in inconsistent behaviors. What's Next? Executives should focus on figuring out the right workforce model for their business while recognizing that there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The key is to focus on implementing a model that is reflective of the nature of their own business model and stakeholder needs. This does not mean that hybrid work with mandating office attendance a few times a week is the only option. Companies should adopt an intentional and regular gathering strategy for all employees to connect routinely. By doing so, they can recharge their social barometers, which is essential for driving organizational alignment, motivation, and engagement. It’s time to move on from debating what model is best and focus on driving momentum on business outcomes. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

You need to have as little friction as possible to propose a 1-1 or a 15 min roundtable to quickly brainstorm something orally. Then you need remote \"telemetry\", meaning access either to chat messages, email, tickets, etc. and a way to process it at scale (without reading everything) in order to defuse sticky situations based on partial infos or misunderstandings.

That seems bonkers to me. reply luch 1 hour agorootparentThat's not what I wanted to say. With remote teams, you need to establish a way to organize the work using written communications which are either mail/slack/sharepoint/whatever and within this framework management needs to have a \"view\" into what the team is doing. It means for example being systematically in cc for mail exchanged and being in every teams discord channel. The new social contract when working remotely is \"you (the manager) can't look over my shoulder to see if I'm working correctly so I (the employee) need to show proofs of communication instead\".

While employers control the data, they don't use it like people seem to assume. Managers are not managing if they attempt to resolve conflicts by attempting to decipher private conversations. There are many ways to resolve these problems without resorting to spying on messages. In an in-person situation with a conflict, there may be no record. We know methods to resolve these conflicts, so I don't understand why people go immediately to \"employers control the data so they can just use it.\" reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 13 hours agorootparentprevBonkers or no, that is a current legal reality if you're talking about chat or email messages which are sent and received using employer-provided means.

We had a good track record of bringing in grads and training them on the job, but the cohort that came in during COVID had a terrible experience, and despite our efforts I'm not sure we ever really provided a good onboarding experience for them, and I don't think the training they received was nearly as effective as the training we used to provide in person. I think WFH is often great for experienced professionals, but ever since that experience I have felt really bad for young professionals trying to make a start in their careers. reply helij 11 hours agorootparentWe successfully onboarded a few grads and interns these last three years and all are productive team members today with a clear path for career progression as well.

People in office do tend to communicate organically with the humans around them, but online it's much harder. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentSometimes I wonder if those of us who prefer remote work are just the same set of people who found \"communicate organically with the humans around them\" to be a major hindrance to their productivity. Increasingly more over time, I have come to really miss the office I went to every day before I worked remotely. I miss having coffee and lunch with people, saying hi on the way in and out, and I really miss having team meetings and 1:1s and brainstorming sessions in person. But I don't miss my desk even a little bit. I spent as much of my time as possible working from private cubbies. When I'm working, I don't want people around, and I don't want to be pulled into \"organic\" communication. In practice, the best process (for me) in an office setting was to ping people asynchronously - \"hey let me know when you have a moment, I want to brainstorm about xyz\" - and then get together when it works for both of you. But this is the same process used in remote work! The downside is you can't walk-and-talk or get a coffee together or find a spot with a whiteboard, everything is soul-sucking video calls. But for me, losing the \"organic\"-ness of communication, specifically, is a pro, not a con. reply shortrounddev2 16 hours agorootparentprevI read an advice column in the Washington Post a couple weeks ago [1] in which the person writing in was asking for advice about implementing RTO mandates. They work for a non-profit and found it hard to manage people remotely. Their complaints were: > 1. They have daily check-in meetings with everyone on the team to make up for the lack of impromptu chats in the office > 2. Collaboration is harder over email than in-person. As an example, they have to produce reports for stakeholders regularly, which requires input from several people. They sync their work by frequently emailing each other changes to the document > 3. Socializing with coworkers is more difficult, which results in less social capital for people to advance their careers with For each point, the author pointed out that there are simple technological and management solutions for each: > 1. Stop doing daily check-ins and trust your reports to do their jobs on their own time table. You didn't do daily check-ins in the office, so don't do them now > 2. Stop using email. It's the worst format of online communication. Slack, MS Teams, etc. have been around for a while. Use them and the features available to you to collaborate. Additionally, use document editing software like MS Word or Google Docs to edit the same document within a cloud account simultaneously instead of sending files to each other. This tech has existed for sooooo long that it should be considered a bit of an embarrassment if a manager in 2024 doesn't know about it yet > 3. Work socialization must become intentional, and opportunities for advancement should be based off of merit and output instead of personal relationships But it seems pretty clear that companies which mandate RTO are simply not equipped, technologically or intellectually, to run such an organization. It's not that remote work is inherently less productive, it's that managers are unable or unwilling to adapt their processes and communication to make it work. Final note: it seems like another big problem with managers is they find they have little work to do if they are not monitoring people all the time and dragging them into unnecessary meetings. I think they feel threatened by the fact that their jobs are being automated away by software --- [1] https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/10/hybrid-wo... reply alberth 16 hours agorootparent> 2. Stop using email. It's the worst format of online communication.

I will fight this new trend of 100% Slack/Teams/Etc. as long as I possibly can. Email provides a barrier between you and the work -- email isn't a real time form of communication. Chats, meanwhile, imply immediate response. Hell, these apps even show when you're active -- I've gotten passive-aggressive messages like, \"I know that you have DND on, but can you confirm you're seeing these messages?\" chats outside of working hours. I get why Slack/Teams/Etc. is a great supplement to email, especially when it's a smaller internal team collaborating. But ditching email is a terrible idea. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentThis is just culture / familiarity. Absolutely nothing about chat implies immediacy by necessity. But I agree that expectations are often set badly, and that's an important cultural problem to solve. reply alberth 15 hours agorootparentprevGlad to hear I'm not alone.

I've often wondered if the real problem is group chat / channels, and not per se the 1:1 type of chat messages. reply shortrounddev2 15 hours agorootparentprevMy problem with email is the amount of spam makes it unusable, and I don't just mean unsolicited advertisements. I get spam from work in the form of notifications and unnecessary CC's, so I'm accustomed to ignoring all emails. I think it may also be generational: at my previous job, I get chewed out by my manager for not responding to some question another coworker had sent me. I was confused because I don't remember getting any questions from them, and I was told that he had emailed it to me. He's in his 40s and I was 26. I told him I get so many useless emails I never check work email. And the best way to reach me is via slack. Still, some on the team continued to use email reply danaris 12 hours agorootparentSounds like you need to learn to manage your email inbox. I have dozens of filters set up to direct emails to particular folders before I ever see them. This is precisely the way to deal with automated notifications. They're always coming from the same source; in some cases, they're not going to your email directly, but to a group address that you can easily filter on. If you're getting unnecessary CCs from particular people commonly, you can set up a filter to automatically route that category (from:thisuser@company, cc:me) to a folder of \"check this once a day (or whatever timetable) to see if anything real got through\". The answer to \"I have trouble with email,\" in an organization where email is a normal mode of communication, is not \"so the whole rest of my team needs to change their workflow to deal with me.\" It's \"so I need to pick up some skills and make checking my email part of my daily workflow.\" reply shortrounddev2 5 hours agorootparentThe rest of the team didn't use emails, only the older team members did. Honestly, none of the companies I worked for used email for communication, I think it's abnormal to be the one using it on the team. Slack doesn't require as much configuration as you described. I don't get the point of email when we have slack reply crowcroft 12 hours agorootparentprevIn large organizations I always see the same bad outcomes. 1. Lots of random DMs/Group DMs. Everything is messy, and gets lost easily. The 'closed' nature of DMs and small groups then often builds up cliques and creates office politics. 2. Move everything into open channels -> descend into pure chaos with 1,000s of channels that no one can keep up with. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentprevYeah, in my experience, chat is way more useful for collaborating than email. But we also haven't built up as much tolerance to its distractions.

I get that we love to categorize argue about RTO vs no RTO but I think the real topic is how companies/organizations are deciding on which model to commit to and why -- the \"why\" helps with communicating and convincing adults to do something like commuting (management is hard work, right?). I get that a contrarian stance can come up with an example to contradict what the article is trying to convey. However, I think the article more so tries to draw situations in which CEO/Management is failing generally (with WebMD) and is hoping that a forced in office environment would solve their management woes. I do believe that a majority of organizations are in this bucket rather than the one you claimed. reply sanderjd 16 hours agoparentprevIf you're a poor manager of your organization's current style of work, is that still poor management, even if you're a good manager in a different setting? To use a sports metaphor, if I'm a really good manager of a team in the German Bundesliga, but then I switch to manage a team in the English Premier League and I'm terrible at that, then that's still bad management, even if I'm not a \"bad manager\" in some universal sense. And it would be weird for the organization to try to fix that problem by moving the team I'm managing to Germany. They would expect me to figure out how to be a good manager in the new setting, or they would find someone to replace me. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 15 hours agorootparent> If you're a poor manager of your organization's current style of work, is that still poor management, even if you're a good manager in a different setting? can we stop making excuses for people? management is about people, unless you're literally moving to a different culture (and I don't mean company culture), your failures as a manager are yours. I can tell you that my current manager is ruthless in that he has no issues getting rid of someone if they're not pulling their weight. I appreciate that about him. He also always has our back. Put him in an organization in which it's more challenging for him to influence our work and I'm confident I would still enjoy him as a manager.

In the Before Times occasional remoting was informal and casual - if you had a doctor's appointment at an odd time, you'd remote for the day, with no formal approval nor teeth-gnashing. Now even small everyday things like this are fraught. There are often formal approval chains now for what used to be entirely between you and your boss. Even where there aren't formal approval chains your boss now knows that these arrangement count against the team in some opaque metrics even they don't have access to. Likewise, hiring remote candidates has become a minefield - pre-pandemic it was often entirely discretionary on the part of the hiring manager. Sure, the default was in-office, but making exceptions to it was entirely between the people who needed to work with the candidate and whether they thought they can make the arrangement work. Now it has to be run up the flagpole - in some places all the way up the flagpole to the very top of the company. And at every rung along that ladder everyone knows - again - that allowing the exception will count against them in opaque and faceless metrics that are being scrutinized. A top performer has to move out of town because of family reasons? In the old days you talk to your manager, maybe your skip, they'd tell HR it's fine, and... it just goes. Now? 95% chance the person has to leave the company, because someone in the newly-installed approval chain is going to nix it because - again - it counts against them personally where it didn't before. Sigh. In so many ways we've regressed on this so much. The level of flexibility and discretion teams have on work locations has narrowed so dramatically, in exchange for yet another spreadsheet-driven bureaucracy. reply symfoniq 17 hours agoparentWish I could give this more upvotes.

When I joined them, I was already in a different state because of my wife's work. So I told them, I cannot join if they don't give me remote exception; it took them ~4-5 weeks to get the sign off for remote exception from the VP. I took the job and 9 months in, Jassy decided to force everyone back to the office. A few of my coworkers (3 out of ~15 people team) have/had left when RTO mandate was announced, and I know at least 4 people are thinking of leaving as soon as they have a chance. Since the RTO, a lot of my colleagues have started working at 9 am and log out at 5pm pronto. Before RTO, they would be working until 6-7 pm and will be logging in around 8 am. Sometimes, coworkers would even log in late because they were commuting. I wonder if Amazon would check the Slack+Chime logs to see how the activity drops before and after RTO mandate. Based on my observation, I would bet that the activity/productivity drops significantly more. Glad I left Amazon.

It measures a lot of things like whether our teams have certain internal processes in place, job satisfaction, tools satisfaction, etc. The surveys provide a list of fixed answers you can choose or if you rank something \"negatively\", you can select an option to describe why you ranked something poorly. Some of us have indirect access to the larger data through senior-level middle management who will either show us the connections data in private Slack DMs (if you're lucky enough to have a friend up that high) or they will blatantly tell us what the data shows in meetings.

There are so many variables involved in trying to predict your distant future that sometimes it makes more sense to take care of the present, with an eye on the near-term. reply yodsanklai 14 hours agorootparentThis is just anecdata, but I spend my 20s/30s doing all sorts of hobbies that I don't even like anymore. I'm working much more in my 40s and have a high income, and I'm at least as happy as I was back then. Also I don't know what age I'll retire, but I'm sure that the money I'm saving now will buy me some comfort in the future. reply hshsh667 16 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's not. Just think about your stress levels commuting, people infecting you with all kinds of diseases at work that lower your quality of life and have the chance to impair you to a great extend. reply zdragnar 16 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of stressful jobs you can find yourself in, and having kids exposes you to far more diseases than working in an office. Nothing is guaranteed, and if you're young having a few stressful years now then retiring is certainly easier than working dead end jobs for another 20. reply abadpoli 11 hours agorootparentprevMy commute isn’t your commute, and you can’t make blanket statements like that. My stress level while commuting is basically zero. Tbh the commute makes me less stressed because it’s a nice time to listen to audio books and provides a physical barrier to “transition” into work mode. I dislike RTO for other reasons, but my stress level was higher while WFH than it is from commuting. reply DiggyJohnson 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat if you don't find commuting (I have a 12 minutes commute against the flow of traffic, I kind of like getting out and seeing the city and I enjoy driving), and aren't too worried about \"all kinds of diseases at work\" (i.e. Covid, Flu, and colds)? To be honest, you seem very paranoid about the risk of impairment by disease caught from coworker at your presumably white-collar tech job. This is minuscule. Does it surprise you that other's might not find your example to \"just think\" about not compelling at all? reply gnicholas 16 hours agorootparentprev> people infecting you with all kinds of diseases at work that lower your quality of life Someone who retires at 40 probably goes to watch movies, eats in restaurants, and travels on airplanes. reply rurp 16 hours agorootparentprevI guess it depends on what you find fulfilling. Having new and interesting experiences in your 20s and 30s can have a pretty different effect on your life than leasure time in your 40s+. In my experience there is minimal overlap between people who maximized working hours in their younger years and have an exciting life outside of work later on. But I'm sure that's partly a reflection on my social circle and everyone is different; there's no one-size-fits-all life advice. reply abadpoli 11 hours agorootparent100% agree, but I don’t think a work commute will be the deciding factor in that. If I wasn’t commuting, I’d just be logging into work earlier, or maybe waking up later. It’s not like I’d be using the extra 30 minutes each morning to go adventure in the mountains. Commuting doesn’t necessarily mean working long hours and missing out on the rest of life. I still only work 35-40 hours, I just sit in my car for 30-45 minutes each day. I definitely wish I didn’t, but for the pay I get (and the pay cut I’d take for taking a remote role), the 30-45 minutes is worth it at least temporarily. reply yodsanklai 14 hours agorootparentprevBetween RTO and long commute, you may have a third option which is moving near the office. reply godelski 16 hours agoparentprev> started working at 9 am and log out at 5pm pronto. Isn't this 7-7.5 hrs? Are you not required to take at least a 30 minute break within that period? Or does Amazon pay for lunch? I thought 9-5 was a myth/thing of the past. reply hazmazlaz 16 hours agorootparentRequired breaks are only for non-exempt roles (typically hourly FTEs with a set schedule). reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentI've had required breaks at part time jobs and minimum wage jobs (which will never give you >35hrs/wk and your schedule is definitely not consistent). My understanding is it is state law and the 3 west coast states all have unpaid 30min breaks (if you aren't on call during break) for >5hrs work. reply DiggyJohnson 16 hours agorootparentprevI work 9-5 almost exactly (sometimes a little less) but I think that's just because we have a relaxed team when it comes to this. I usually end up making up some hours one or two evenings per week at my choosing. It's a really nice situation, but most of y'all would laugh at my TC. Everything in life's a tradeoff. reply mesh 15 hours agorootparentprevGenerally salaried positions, at least in tech on west coast include lunch, breaks, etc... reply godelski 14 hours agorootparentInteresting. Maybe because I'm an intern at a big CA based tech company right now that's been pro WFH, but my timesheet will specify the regular and unpaid hours. It even puts the unpaid into a lunch category. But then again, my internship feels like a job and I'm a bit confused. I do all the work with no direction, just report to my manager weekly and no training. Every internship I've had just feels like every job I've had except I don't get the equity and 401k that normal employees do. I've also always had to fill out a timesheet for every salaried position I've had, which seems a bit odd too. It's at least be quicker to fill out a checkbox lol. reply ryandrake 9 hours agorootparentI don't think it's unusual to have to fill out a timesheet for salaried jobs. Most of the places I've worked have required employees to do that ritual. And I say \"ritual\" because it's basically just writing \"8\" in the \"hours\" field for each day and signing it, regardless of how much you actually worked. I remember once getting a talking-to for writing anything but 8 into my time sheet. I've also worked at a place where I had to physically clock in and clock out (even for breaks and trips to the bathroom), and it was a salaried software development job. Not unheard of at all. reply un1xl0ser 13 hours agorootparentprevThat's not a sign of a good internship program. I've always put a great deal of time coming up with projects that are suitable for the intern, and they always have to be tailored to the individual skill-set after the process. At the end of it we either have something that worked, and we have a good sense of the capabilities and fit with the team dynamic. I would ensure that you have someone to talk to who can discuss what success looks like for the role (of intern). With that, there is always what you want to get out of it, but if you are looking for a job, you need to have performance and goal conversations reguarly. How are you doing compared to peers or other interns, etc. reply godelski 11 hours agorootparent> That's not a sign of a good internship program. I don't think you're wrong, but my situation appears to be the norm when talking with others[0]. All but one internship I've had is like this and honestly I don't think I can adequately say I've gotten training, be it internship (excluding the one) or job (I worked prior to grad school). I've simply concluded that training is a thing of the past, or it is expected to be self-driven, and performed outside work. (Personally I do not think this is an intelligent move, but these companies are quite successful and I'm not even a millionaire, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯) > How are you doing compared to peers or other interns, etc. Hard to say, as I'm not sure who would be an adequate peer. If you are to ask me personally compared to my expectations, I would say below expectations. In part there is a lack of the adequate resources I need to do the job (I work in generative ML but I'm trying to not dox myself so I can be honest and I want to hear your advice), there is more complexity than I expected and no one to really bounce ideas off of or whom can offer advice, and I'll be honest that my motivation is nowhere near where it was when I started, so I'll admit that I could do better. But I do want to say that I am still learning a lot during this time, getting work done (my manager seems happy, I've had no complaints, and its the second job I've had where someone says \"well done\" more than once in a blue moon. It's been extended twice now, so its a decent signal that they're happy with my work), and having a reasonable wage does reduce a significant amount of stress. So I don't want this to come off as depressed doom and gloom, it's more that the conversation is around critiques rather than highlighting the good or benefits. I'm generally happy about the opportunity but it is clear that my experience(s) does not fit the common expectation of this title and that there is room for improvement (both me and them). But if critiques aren't acknowledged, how then can I improve? (I am looking for other teams who may offer a better fit, as that might just be it) [0] There is a gap that I do notice though. It appears that this is not the norm for those who obtain internships that are more prestigious or the highly sought after ones. But I am not at a top 10 school and that appears to be one of the stronger variables of correlation (more so than understanding, as I do talk and collaborate with people from those institutions so I think I have a decent gauge on at least intellectual capabilities. There are, of course, people who stand out, but most seem no different). Connections appear to be a key part of getting internships and undoubtedly this is an opportunity feedback system. You take what you can get. I'm a bit surprised others do not exploit this, as it reasons that you could get top talent by creating top talent, but that's an entirely different conversation. reply un1xl0ser 14 hours agorootparentprevYou may actually be hourly and not salaried. That said, it's not uncommon to be forced to log when you work, especially when there are PTO and things like that involved and that need to be accounted for. Are you paid for the hours you work in the internship? If so then you are not an exempt salaried employee. reply godelski 13 hours agorootparentPretty sure I'm technically hourly but clearly not for any practical purposes. I'm not allowed to place additional hours, even if I worked them. My work has unlimited PTO fwiw. Though I've also worked full time salaried jobs and also been always required to fill out a timesheet. Often being told that it doesn't matter and the manager just saying they fill out a standard block at the beginning of each week. This is really what I've done at every job. But I do want to make clear that I've had salaried positions in the past and not been given such offers. I am also not aware of any person that I know (offline) who has a paid lunch period and this includes many people in many sectors mostly in the west coast. This even includes my now retired parents. reply dpflan 16 hours agoparentprev> \"Since the RTO, a lot of my colleagues have started working at 9 am and log out at 5pm pronto\" In office workers have more defined working schedules? Is that what this means? That seems healthy for the worker. -- UPDATE -- Must consider the commute factor for time-demand on employee. reply swasheck 16 hours agorootparenti agree with the sentiment of your comment, but the pervasive RTO narrative from c-levels is not about restoring their employees' collective, holistic health. rather, it's couched in a narrative of productivity and community, the former being what i believe was being countered in the comment. there's also the push/pull of the health benefits and disadvantages of commutes and other external factors that go into office-based dynamics. additionally, as i've mentioned in another comment on a similar thread, RTO mandates are not accompanied by corporate commitments to restore the cultures and environments that were present in the pre-remote migration which only intensifies the skepticism and recalcitrance of the workers. edit: changed \"ramps up\" to \"intensifies\" reply bdw5204 16 hours agorootparentEmployees working exactly 9 to 5 is absolutely the opposite of what employers doing RTOs for \"productivity\" want. They want them putting in unpaid overtime and are suspicious that they aren't when they're at home because they can't see them. In a healthy work environment where there's high morale and trust, the exact work hours are going to be off somewhat on a day to day basis in either direction based on logical stopping points. In a toxic environment, workers will pretend to work towards the end of the day then go home exactly when the clock hits 5. Once they can, workers in such an environment will probably leave. reply NineStarPoint 16 hours agorootparentprevIn a vacuum, yes. In practice, a ton of people I know spent all that extra time commuting which is probably worse for most people than putting some extra work in. reply sanderjd 16 hours agorootparentprevFlexibility has both costs and benefits, for both employers and workers. Being able to switch off and on work throughout the day is a significant benefit for many people, and many people experience having a less well-defined schedule as a significant cost. For some people the benefit will outweigh the cost and for others the opposite will be true. (And I'm sure for lots of people, they will think the benefits outweigh the costs, while actually working in an unhealthy detrimental way.) But one size doesn't fit all. I'm honestly sympathetic to management of companies figuring out how to balance what's best for individuals with what's best for teams and organizations as a whole. But I strongly believe that the most successful companies coming out of this period will be those who take this problem seriously, rather than those who pine for the old days and \"solve\" it with a one-size-fits-all edict from the top. reply Clubber 16 hours agorootparentprevTo me it says that working in an office+commute is much more draining than working at home. So much so that they work only the required amount. When they worked at home, they worked more because it was more enjoyable. reply ryanSrich 16 hours agoparentprevSounds like a PR-friendly way to do layoffs. Force people back into the office knowing 30%+ are going to quit. reply potatolicious 15 hours agorootparentYeah, sometimes these are soft-layoffs, but even under that logic it's a bad idea: your best employees are the ones who have the most options outside of your company. If you do a traditional layoff you get to decide who stays and who goes and have at least the chance to try and retain your top players. If you do a soft-layoff someone else does the choosing, and the more employable the employee is on the outside the more likely they are to leave. Just ass-backwards decision-making no matter how one slices it. reply ryanSrich 15 hours agorootparent> your best employees are the ones who have the most options outside of your company Aren't these employees the most likely to get exceptions though? reply CodeNest 16 hours agoparentprevTotally agree with your move! reply mrweasel 17 hours agoprevSo research is finally coming to the same conclusion that a lot of people, myself included came to over a year ago. Well managed companies don't care where you work, it simply doesn't matter. The problem is that management is a lot harder than many thought, but you could sort of hide the fact that you're bad at it when everyone is at the office. There simply isn't enough talented managers around. We're not solving that by requiring everyone to return to the office, the terrible managers are still terrible. If anything companies could use this opportunity to identify people with poor management skills. If a team under-performed during the work-from-home period, then it's probably time get their manager some training. reply timmg 16 hours agoparent> The problem is that management is a lot harder than many thought, but you could sort of hide the fact that you're bad at it when everyone is at the office. There simply isn't enough talented managers around. I feel like this is true for so many jobs these days. Like I think that a lot of people (in high skill jobs) are really not good enough for their jobs. But we simply don't have enough good people for all the jobs. Just as a programmer, so many people that are paid to do it are... bad. Managers, same. PMs (I think) same. I wouldn't be surprised if others in other professions feel the same. reply mrweasel 15 hours agorootparentThat's true, but at least most of the developers have some training. Many people are thrown into management or wants to be managers, but never put any effort into building the skill set required. There are remarkably few people who are just born as talented managers, probably the same number that are just naturally talented developers. All of the best managers I've had have all had some level of management training. Some got training while I worked on their teams and the improvement from no training to just a few months of training is pretty remarkably. reply Keegs 15 hours agorootparentprevProduct management is tricky because the skills PM applicants are evaluated for are not necessarily the skills that make a good product manager. But I think this supports your point. Where it's hard to judge performance, actual talent will vary. reply marvelagex 12 hours agoparentprevYes. We should not blame the one who actually performs bad.

Working in the office necessarily forces you to structure your work in time and space. reply Spivak 15 hours agorootparentYou do know you're just parroting RTO thought leadership propaganda, right? The phrasing of structuring your work \"in time and space\" is rather unique and comes most recently from business thinkfluencers trying sell RTO as \"new paradigm at the workplace.\" The real point underpinning the CEO ball fondling is strategies for creating structure for people that need it originally assembled for students working async and remote. Moving between spaces can create structure, putting on a \"uniform\" creates structure, having blocks of time planned out ahead creates structure, having small incremental goals creates structure, having blocks of work with regular check-ins (cards/standup) creates structure. Like it's just your standard ADHD time/focus management but pretending that these two specific things are best for everyone. reply otabdeveloper4 3 hours agorootparentSorry, I've never read a \"business thinkfluencer\" in my life. Wouldn't even know where to find one. The undeniable fact is that people want \"work from home\" because they have serious issues following schedules and making plans.

But maybe it is more interesting what you should do afterwards. What did you do afterward? reply Joeboy 16 hours agorootparentThe project came to an end (hence me having to wrap up their work), so I didn't do much. I'm on a new project now, but I have the same question. If someone keeps insisting their work is coming along great and they'll be checking it in real soon, how do I know if it's true? reply potatolicious 14 hours agorootparentAsk for proof. Some employees are lower-performing and some need more structure. \"Can you push your work-in-progress branch so I can take a look?\" If they are consistently under-performing you need to structure them. Split larger tasks into smaller sub-tasks that are more tractable over shorter time periods. If a large task is expected to take 3 weeks, split it into chunks of 1-2 days. That way if a code review isn't sent out you get a quick signal that progress isn't being made. Remember that as the manager you have authority. They may chafe at being asked to do intermediate checkins and splitting the work into smaller quanta - that's fine, they can grouse about it with their friends, but they still have to do it. If they are underperforming even within this structure, have them keep a work log - which is basically a 1:1 asynchronous standup with just you and them. Read this work log daily and, in combination with smaller quanta of work, it should be fairly obvious progress isn't made. At all points don't hide the ball from them that they are underperforming. Tell them that they are underperforming but give them the resources necessary to improve. Solicit their ideas on how to improve and consider implementing them. Some employees can be structured to improve this ways. Others cannot - you work with HR on that latter group. But again: as the manager you do not need to see butts-in-seats to gauge productivity. More importantly, it is on you to set a benchmark for productivity and communicate to your team your expectation that everyone hits it, and alert them in your (frequent!) 1:1s when they are falling short. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentprev> their work is coming along great and they'll be checking it in real soon This is the process problem in my mind. Why are they working on something that goes weeks without checking in code? They should have smaller actionable chunks that can be checked in at least once a week. More importantly, take that same employee and put them in an office and do you really think things are going to be different? Alt tab is a thing, looking busy is a thing, and if you're entirely relying on their word that things are going well then you're going to get yourself in trouble regardless of whether you're in an office or remote. reply Joeboy 12 hours agorootparent> Why are they working on something that goes weeks without checking in code? I think it was a couple of days' worth of work, which they told me was nearly finished for a couple of weeks. All I was saying was there was no way for me to know whether that was the true or not. Unless they pushed the code, which they were always supposedly on the cusp of doing. On the last day before the holidays I was very explicit that they needed to push their code by the end of the day, which they said they would but didn't. Perhaps I need to be more assertive about it, or insist they pushed it live while I watched or something. I do think I'd have found the situation easier if we had a face-to-face relationship, although that's not really what I was trying to argue. reply DiggyJohnson 15 hours agorootparentprevI'm sorry about your Christmas, but that seems like a poor reason to never give the benefit of the doubt going forwards. Situations are situational. reply Joeboy 14 hours agorootparent> Situations are situational Indeed. I suspect a lot of people here work in situations where there's slack in the system and nothing particularly bad happens if the work doesn't get done. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentYeah, no. We have tight deadlines that we're expected to hit and clear milestones for reaching those deadlines. If we miss them hundreds of people throughout the organization will know and ask why, and multi-million dollar sales contracts go out the window. reply Joeboy 12 hours agorootparentOk, but unlike the person I was replying to you seem to be arguing against giving people the benefit of the doubt. reply lolinder 10 hours agorootparentI'm arguing against shrugging and saying \"it's because of remote work\" when your project is falling apart.

I know many people that are not productive at home, none of them have a home office, instead are using some Shared Space, like a corner of the living room, the kitchen table, etc. If you do not have a dedicated home office then likely your home will be filled with distractions, Living situations impacts this as well, if you lived a alone with no pets vs having a house full of roommates, children, spouses, pets, etc. So from a Management perspective do they fire all the people that cant work from home, or require everyone to return to office?

Today I'm working from home as I can't afford the commute time, last week was pre-pandemic 4 days in office. What I don't like is changing what WFO looked like. If someone had to WFH for personal reasons (e.g. repair, packages, child issues, doctors appt), they just did it. Four days a week was normal, five was never normal. If we are trying to do 3 days and go to four, then everyone needs a dedicated desk. If you aren't willing to put a dedicated desk for people, you don't have a mandate for WFO, you have a mandate for hybrid. I sit next to an officer who is not ranked highly enough to have a desk.

There are about 120 seats on our floor and about 1000 in the building. I’ve heard only sixty people use the building in a given day. So the usage rate is much much lower than the occupancy rate, i.e. we count as occupants even with zero usage. reply pauldix 16 hours agorootparentOMG we had half of the 4th floor of that building on sublease when the pandemic hit (and for 2 years prior). The week of the first lockdown in 2020 we were all set to sign a new long term lease for an entire upper floor and half of the one below. Lockdown happened and we told them \"let's just hold off on this for a bit\". They were, of course, disappointed and desperate to get us to sign. We held off, and it quickly became obvious the pandemic was going to be a long term thing. So when our sublease expired in September 2020 we moved out and have been fully remote and distributed ever since. We lucked out and dodged a bullet by not signing a long term lease for more space than we needed at the absolute top of the market. Granted, we were already 60% remote at the time so it wasn't a completely massive shift. But that's it, we're remote and distributed and we're never looking back.

I suspect, but obviously don't know for sure, that merely making use of the real estate doesn't factor at all. It's more \"come into the office because that's how I know how to manage people\" and \"somethings actually are hard to do remote.\" We are productive remote for some things, but then get stuck on tricky issues that seem to get solved instantly when we are together.

Which brings us to the answer to your question: > Why didn't ICANN just charge a flat fee for any string to resolve to an IP? Because ICANN doesn’t control what strings resolve! They delegate to registries (by putting NS records in the root resolvers), and for ccTLDs it’s up to each country to set policy and infrastructure to taste.

Regardless, I have the .co, .me, and .io that match my best .com domain even though I'll never use them. I'd do the same for .ai, but it's too expensive. Even the new gTLDs are iffy depending on your risk tolerance. In my opinion, the only truly \"safe\" domains since ICANN removed most price controls [1] are .com and .net. Also, many of the new gTLD registries are owned by Ethos Capital via Identity Digital [2] (Donuts + Afilias). > In January 2021, Ethos Capital acquired Donuts after their failed bid to gain control over the .org internet domain.

I wouldn't say to never use those TLDs, but I would use a strategy that only relies on them for shortening URLs and redirecting traffic to top tier TLDs. For example: somecompany.balloons --> somecompanyballoons.com And never let a non-premium new gTLD registration lapse if there's a chance you want to use it.

    "originBody": "The photo to the right is of the Staples parking lot behind the York Road store in Baltimore, a classic example of a place that needs to be turned back to urban forest — or developed into a much-needed something else. I can’t think of a time when, during fairly frequent trips to this store, I saw more than a dozen vehicles in the long, large lot. And, if you keep it top-of-mind as you travel, you see this sort of thing in many urban and suburban places. As I just suggested in my Sun column, Baltimore and the surrounding counties should conduct a “useless parking lot inventory” to identify all impervious surfaces, public or private, that are either no longer needed or too large for their current use. Retail shopping centers in decline, abandoned industrial buildings — remove the unnecessary asphalt and plant some trees. Or do something constructive with this unused, paved space — new housing, a solar energy field. Part of this is a result of poor planning and ordinance-making that long ago overcompensated for the wide use of automobiles. Henry Grabar, a staff writer at Slate, mentions this in a book published last year, Paved Paradise: How Parking Explains the World. ”On a national level, certainly, there’s far more parking than we need,” Grabar said in an interview. “There are at least four parking spaces for every car, meaning that the parking stock is no more than 25 percent full at any given time. And some of those cars are moving at any given time, so parking may be a good deal emptier than that.” I don’t know that anyone besides Grabar is even thinking about this, because parking lots are so deeply embedded in the American psyche, in the environment we take for granted. But certain changes to how we live and work — the demise of malls and the decline of brick-and-mortar retail, the advance of telecommuting in the wake of the pandemic — must have diminished the need for all that asphalt. And all that asphalt effects both human health and the health of the planet. Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

Thankfully, it seems a fair number of cities are removing such restrictions, but hopefully it becomes more widespread. In general I hope the US can urbanize, the older I get the more I realize it’s not really enjoyable living in this country. I don’t think I want hyper dense, but having more places to walk, bike, and explore that aren’t just cookie-cutter boilerplate-esque suburbs and freeways would be really nice. More places to meet people too, there’s so few third places. And not needing to drive would be a really big convenience. (To be clear, I doubt most of the US will urbanize given the rural nature of a lot of it, but I hope at least bigger cities can move in that direction) reply coldpie 13 hours agoparent> having more places to walk, bike, and explore that aren’t just cookie-cutter boilerplate-esque suburbs and freeways would be really nice. We're at a critical juncture here in the Twin Cities. The state DOT needs to re-build the interstate that cuts right through the entire metro area (I-94) for the first time since it was first built 50 years ago. There is a serious proposal to remove the interstate entirely and replace it with a street. This would be amazing, the area around I-94 is, as you'd expect, quite unpleasant to be in. It's noisy, dirty, and dangerous. The interstate is infamous for being one of those roads that was planned to run through and destroy working class and Black neighborhoods in the 50s and 60s[1], and removing it would go some way to regaining what had been room for people to live. I think it's a bit of a longshot, but dang, I would love to see the cities recover that space for the people who actually live here, not just those who are driving through it. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm really hoping we don't blow it by just rebuilding the stupid thing.

There is already a bypass, I-481 that loops around the city to the East to connect with I-90. Very similar story - the highway divides Syracuse University from the poor Black neighborhoods. It's a scar through the middle of town. I'm very excited to see how the city heals around it. reply coldpie 11 hours agorootparentCongrats, that's huge! reply jnwatson 2 hours agorootparentprevHouston is about to remove the Pierce Elevated, a section of I-45 that separates Downtown from midtown.

MnDOT has contact info on the Rethinking I-94 page[1], tell your city council rep, your county commissioner, your mayor, your state legislators, the governor. Tell your friends and neighbors. It's so easy to just fall back and do the same thing we've always done; making a change is really hard and we need to show that there is support for it.

I'm afraid that this would wind up like Vancouver, which lacks freeways through the city and has pretty bad traffic as a result. Better maybe to tunnel it under if possible? That works well for Seattle, although we still have I5 to contend with that divides the downtown from Capitol Hill (there is talk of lidding the entire freeway through downtown). reply avianlyric 12 hours agorootparentHow does a freeway through a city improve traffic in a city vs building a freeway around a city (no need to bother with the expense of tunnelling under). Cars on a freeway are either headed to your city as a destination, in which case the speed at which you deliver them into the city doesn’t make much difference, they’re always going to cause traffic when they leave the freeway. Or the cars are headed through the city, in which I would assume most of them would be just as happy to go around the city as go through it. So if you get to pick between through and around, why would any sane city choose to put the freeway through your city? You’re just bringing noise and pollution into your city, putting a huge great impassable scar through your city, and forcing the people who live to drive everywhere because the freeway slice up the city into segments that you move between in a car. reply eropple 11 hours agorootparentThe highway under Boston has turned out to be one of the better solutions that the area could've had, I think. It doesn't mean that the highway that goes around (I-95) is unused, or even underused, but I-93/the former Central Artery going underground has allowed some really important revitalization of parts of the city while also giving pretty direct and (outside of the worst part of rush hour) quick access to most of Boston and Cambridge by car. As forward-looking as much of the area is, we weren't getting away with \"less car\", and I don't think most places will today either. reply kelnos 10 hours agorootparentI was thinking about this too. I've never lived in Boston, but have visited often enough over the past 20-25 years. While the Big Dig was an awful, wasteful, corrupt project, the results -- IMO -- make it all worth it. Moving all those highways underground made quite a few areas much more livable than before. reply fragmede 10 hours agorootparentprevless car means ebike and scooters which are a viable option these days reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentprevYou can't build a freeway around Seattle unless you plan to make it float. Well, there is 405, but that is way around (and is its own chokepoint on the east side). Vancouver has much of the same problem with hills and water making it act as a choke point. I'm not sure how the Twin Cities compares. reply dghlsakjg 4 hours agorootparentThere’s the trans Canada highway that skirts around Vancouver. It’s the fastest route by far whether you are going into the city or through it. The I5 meanwhile turns into the 99 on the Canadian side of the border, and goes right through the city. It’s a nightmare since it is officially a highway, but in reality just a surface street in the city. reply fragmede 3 hours agorootparent101 in sf is the same way. it's a highway not a freeway, but it's just a city street that goes across the city. reply kelnos 10 hours agorootparentprevTraffic will suck in a city that isn't designed to discourage people from driving. It doesn't matter if there is an elevated highway running through it or not; traffic is going to suck. Invest in transit and make it easier for people to get around without cars; that's the only way to solve traffic. Building more roads (and widening existing roads) just induces more demand. reply dghlsakjg 4 hours agorootparentprevYou completely leave out that the trans-Canada highway has a six lane bridge, and a train bridge less than 5 miles east of the downtown peninsula, and there was a conscious decision to not route the freeway through the peninsula. Any freeway through Vancouver would have to cut through all of east Vancouver and then the downtown core then Stanley park, and they would have to completely rebuild the lionsgate bridge since it is only three lanes total, and then tear out a huge portion of the residential neighborhood on the other side of the bridge. Why in the world would Vancouver, which is on a much narrower strip of land want to do what Seattle did and divide their city in half so people can get to Whistler 15 minutes faster. reply sfpotter 12 hours agorootparentprevCreating I-5 was really contentious at the time. It destroyed neighborhoods. My family has lived in the area for several generations and my parents can attest to this. Lidding it would be great, but removing it would be better. There are loads of people who live in the suburbs north and south of Seattle and expect to be able to drive 20-30 miles each way day-in-day-out to commute. If the city continues to grow, this simply isn't tenable in the long run, because you can't grow highway capacity forever; they would no longer be able to do this, which would be good. Just rip the band-aid off. reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agorootparentThe only thing worse than having I5 is not having I5. There really isn't enough north-south corridors to replace it (15th, 99, east/west lake...really that's it), given that I5 is close to the water and a huge hill as it comes in across from UW. It is already non-viable to expect a 20-30 minute commute into the city. We saw what happened when the Palestine supporters blocked off I5 a few weeks ago...on a weekend without a rush hour, people were stuck in traffic for hours. reply sfpotter 11 hours agorootparentThere are no major highways through Manhattan. The city is better for it. Drive around the lake if you need to get past the city. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentI used to commute from westchester county into midtown, and there were definitely parkways in, although I never needed to go all the way down to Manhattan itself. I would usually try to take the train though (often not possible given how westchester county is poorly connected to train stations). reply aidenn0 3 hours agorootparentprevHow do you get from the GW bridge to the Cross-Bronx Expressway if there are no major highways through Manhattan? reply resonantjacket5 11 hours agorootparentprevIt's actually a bit interesting to see WSDOT's plan for i-5. For capacity they aren't expanding I-5 directly, but expanding i-405 and sr167 instead for people trying to go past Seattle. For i-5 within Seattle area, there are some 2030s plans to convert the hov lanes to toll lanes and reconfiguring the reversible express lane system. * I-5 Managed Lanes: SR 16 to Pierce/ King County Line * I-5 Managed Lanes: Pierce/ King County Line to I-405 * I-5 Managed Lanes: I-405 to US 2 https://www.psrc.org/media/4840 reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentI don't see that working out. I405 is often worse than I5, it is just as bottlenecked as I5 is, and there isn't much room to expand it especially when it runs right up next to the water. I feel sorry for anyone who has to actually do that commute. It was horrible when I was living in Bothell and attending UW 30 years ago. reply resonantjacket5 9 hours agorootparentThey are constructing it right now the expansion between bellevue to renton. https://wsdot.wa.gov/construction-planning/search-projects/i... The bellevue to lynnwood section was already 'expanded' a decade ago though as one can tell, it still has traffic. They're opting to increase the tolls now. reply mc32 6 hours agorootparentprevI think Boeing threatened to pull out of Seattle if WSDOT did not improve freeways, some years ago -getting stuff in and out of Everett is really important to them. If I-5 was torn down and only left with surface streets, what's left of Boeing would pull out and go to Kansas or some place. reply uoaei 12 hours agorootparentprevCan you articulate a cogent reason why people need to cross the city on such a thoroughfare just to live their lives? reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentYou are located in the north of the city and need to get somewhere south of the city, or vice versa. You only have a few roads to do that east or west of Lake Washington. In most cases, people aren't going to downtown Seattle, downtown Seattle is just in the way. reply uoaei 11 hours agorootparentWhy are those services not available in the north of the city? This is as much a planning issue as traffic is. reply ndriscoll 9 hours agorootparentMaybe it doesn't make sense to have duplicated services for the city. I grew up in Tucson. There's a zoo, but it wouldn't really make sense to have 2 zoos. Likewise with the Sonoran Desert Museum. There are also unique locations to visit. There's 1 Titan Missile Museum. There's 1 Old Tucson Studios. There's 1 Biosphere 2. They are spread out on opposite ends of the city. There are a bunch of hiking spots that are all different, and people don't want to go to the same one over and over. Then you have things like the air force base or the university. They're important for the economy so you may work at or near them, but for the most part you don't really want to live directly adjacent to them. Fighter jets are very, very loud all day long (my mom lived where you could see the runway right behind her house when I was a teenager), and the military is known to dump very nasty chemicals for their training exercises. University students throw parties, and there's more crime in the area. For a few years, I lived a little over 2 miles from the university, and I had my bike stolen out of my backyard. In the further out part of town where I grew up, that was completely unheard of. Some of the downtown parks are mostly full of homeless adults. The parks where I grew up were mostly full of kids/teenagers. So there's reasons why you might want to live within a ~30 minute drive of a denser area with services or work, but without having to actually live near a dense area. And your day-to-day services are already spread across most of the city, so you don't need to travel for those. I get the impression that many cities have a similar dynamic. reply com2kid 11 hours agorootparentprevSeattle is a narrow city bordered by water on the west and the east, so a lot of its expansion has happened along the north/south axis. If I want to buy furniture, I need to go either to the far north or far south of the city to a suburb just outside the city limits (cheaper land). Culturally, lots of food can only be found in certain areas of the city, which means north/south traveling. In regards to services overall, obscene land prices means that not much new is being built that isn't owned by large corporations, so we are pretty much stuck with what we have, and what we have is rather quickly disappearing. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentprevI think it has to do with the way the city grew out north and south, with the city itself as a chokepoint (since it is surrounded by water otherwise). Common reasons people need to go from north seattle to south seattle: IKEA, Southcenter, Seatac. I'm sure there are reasons for people to go north as well, but I have a harder time thinking of them (other than that they went south and now have to come back north). reply com2kid 11 hours agorootparentThere is some really great African food up north just outside the city. :-D Likewise along the northern parts of Aurora you can get some really great Korean food. (Also not strictly in the city limits). Parks, lots of parks. The only decent real \"spas\" I've found are all up north (Again, Shoreline, just outside of the city) Ballard and Fremont are both big draws. UW, kind of a biggie. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentFederal Way has good Korean food also (well, along with lots of Koreans). Frankly, you'll find Asian communities south, east and north, with the high end in the east, the middle end in the north, and lots of value in the south. Schools are better in the north, which is why we chose Ballard rather than Beacon Hill. The reason I don't think about North Seattle so much is because I live here, I guess (and getting places isn't so hard if I'm not crossing Seattle). reply sfpotter 10 hours agorootparentIt sounds like you are already set up for I-5 getting obliterated. If you only go to the south end for Ikea, Southcenter, and Seatac, how often do you really need to do those things? It's not like it becomes impossible to drive there, it just takes a little longer. Frankly, traffic in Seattle just isn't that bad compared to other major cities. I just checked the traffic from Ballard to Ikea, and it's 45 minutes on 99... I-5 isn't even the ideal route right now. Of course I'm playing devil's advocate a little bit here, but you also have to weigh this against just how much additional real estate would come available if I-5 was gone. I don't think people's need for driving convenience actually stacks up that strongly against all the other positive considerations. reply seanmcdirmid 10 hours agorootparentWhenever I-5 is blocked off, 99 will be a mess, so its not like I can just say \"oh, not my problem because I can avoid using it.\" You have to think about the traffic between Vancouver BC and Portland Oregon, it has to go somewhere, and 405 is even worse than I5 most of the time. reply resonantjacket5 11 hours agorootparentprev> I think it has to do with the way the city grew out north and south, with the city itself as a chokepoint (since it is surrounded by water otherwise).

Also I find it a bit interesting you have a harder time thinking of interesting stuff in north seattle, I am actually sometimes annoyed having to drive north past downtown seattle to reach north seattle. I didn't really think about it but yeah ikea/southcenter are relatively easy for me to reach. :) @uoaei Anyways regarding planning itself. Seattle is actually actively planning their next community plan, one of the items called out is whether to allow more 'urban villages' which have shops and other amenities. For malls, Northgate should have been the north seattle mall but it's currently being redeveloped. There's U village but it's a bit high end. The other alternative of Alderwood mall isn't too bad to get to by driving but during peak traffic can be quite slow. https://www.seattle.gov/opcd/one-seattle-plan reply buildsjets 5 hours agorootparentLight Rail to Lynnwood will be open by September of this year, which gets you to within 2 miles of Alderwood Mall. Light Rail to Alderwood? 2040, suckers. reply seanmcdirmid 11 hours agorootparentprevI live in Ballard, so maybe I just got used to everything up here. We don't usually need to drive unless we go somewhere far away (if anything downtown, just take the D line). reply mitthrowaway2 3 hours agorootparentprevBecause nobody knows how to build a train, it's a mystery. reply _whiteCaps_ 12 hours agorootparentprevI love that Vancouver doesn't have a freeway through the city - but they've also got a relatively good transit system. IIRC it's the equivalent of 26 lanes for cars. reply seanmcdirmid 12 hours agorootparentVancouver has some horrible stroads to make up for its lack of freeways. I wouldn't call it very nice, more like dystopian. reply mb7733 12 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, having lived in Vancouver as well as many cities that _do_ have highways running right through town, I didn't miss that in Vancouver at all. Traffic will suck both ways, and at least Vancouver avoids having ugly, loud highways along its waterfront and through most of its downtown. Definitely, the best case for cars is to have fast highways that bypass the city, but there isn't a lot of room with that given Vancouver's geography, so it's a lesser-of-two-evils. Beyond cars, public transit and cycling provide a better solution in my opinion anyway. Regardless... the biggest traffic pain point in downtown Vancouver is the 3-lane (total) Lions Gate bridge. reply seanmcdirmid 7 hours agorootparentOne of the reason I passed on a townhome in Wallingford with a really good view was because of the tire noise on the ship canal bridge. I’m not sure the other bridge is any better though. A tunnel under it all would be ideal. Whenever I visit Vancouver, I find the traffic horrible compared to Seattle. It’s like…no I don’t want to drive here (to be fair, I don’t want to drive downtown Seattle either, but there is so much more going on in downtown Vancouver that it’s hard to avoid). reply coldpie 12 hours agorootparentprevGotcha covered here in the twin cities -- we already have north and south bypasses in I-494 and I-694. Now we have an opportunity to get I-94 out of the middle of the metro. reply kredd 10 hours agorootparentprevI live in Vancouver, and absolutely love how we didn’t go with the freeway idea. And traffic will suck anyways, might as well let the locals enjoy the walks and life instead. reply seanmcdirmid 10 hours agorootparentIf you search for Stroads, you inevitably bring up Vancouver. You've just swapped one evil for another. I can't imagine walking along a stroad being very nice. https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2014/03/12/metro-vancouver-str... reply kelnos 10 hours agorootparentStroads aren't inevitable when you get rid of elevated highways. They're just yet another result of poor urban planning. reply seanmcdirmid 10 hours agorootparentYes, they aren't. But my position is that what Vancouver has (world famous stroads) is worse than if they buried a freeway through town instead. If someone suggests deleting I5 through Seattle and replacing it with Vancouver-like Stroads, I'm going to vote against them as fast as possible. reply kredd 8 hours agorootparentprevOh, I totally agree about the stroads, I wish we could somehow make them disappear, alas impossible. They’re doing an ok job densifying some parts of them, so it’s less dead at least. reply trimethylpurine 11 hours agorootparentprevI was just driving around in Seattle and couldn't help but notice everywhere I went was just a few miles away but it took 20-30 minutes because there was no highway in between. I have to wonder if that reduces or increases emissions. I suspect it's the latter since you have more cars running longer and stop/starting more often. reply uoaei 12 hours agorootparentprevBad traffic is a good catalyst for spurring local commercial development, assuming zoning and other bureaucratic measures don't hamper the situation entirely. reply stefan_ 12 hours agorootparentprevAll cities will forever have \"bad traffic\". Car transport capacity is plain abysmal. reply mitthrowaway2 3 hours agorootparentTokyo's traffic is pretty reasonable, actually. It's quite surprising. I rarely encounter a traffic light where all the cars don't make it through, unless there's construction. This is probably because train transport capacity is prodigious, and driving is expensive. reply shiroiuma 2 hours agorootparentThat's exactly it. Almost no one actually drives anywhere: most of the cars are taxis, and most of the rest of the vehicles are commercial (e.g. cargo trucks). When most of the people outside are taking a train, walking, or riding a bicycle, there aren't too many cars on the roads and consequently there isn't much traffic. The busiest places I see are near logistics centers, with lots of truck traffic coming and going. Also, driving isn't expensive in Tokyo at all, it's actually free except on the toll highways. What's expensive is parking: with few places to park, and it being expensive to rent a parking space in your apartment, it's not that affordable or practical to drive. People also aren't allowed to own cars unless they have a place to park them, so we don't have the problem of car owners fighting over scarce street parking like many other cities. reply UtopiaPunk 13 hours agoparentprevI think urbanizing core metro areas is actually key to protecting rural areas. I was sitting in a coffee shop in a small town and I overheard a conversation next to me. Two elderly men were talking, and one of them made a comment to the effect of, \"I like a rural town, so I try to vote to keep it that way.\" Two or three decades ago, this town really was a small farming town, but the population is growing and the town is changing. It's not becoming a city, though, not by any means! As the city (somewhat) nearby is becoming more expensive, the suburban sprawl is, well sprawling. The small rural town is transforming into a suburb of the city. I would agree that this is a negative change for the small town, and I would argue that the solution is to urbanize the nearby city. There should be much more housing, and it should be much more affordable to live in the city. As it stands, many people want to live in that city, but find the housing prices unaffordable. So these people make a compromise between how much they are willing to pay on housing vs how long they are willing to travel (almost always by car) into the city. I count myself in this group. Urban areas and rural areas complement one another, and there's pros and cons to living in either kind of place. However, post-WWII styled suburbs are, in my opinion, a net negative. reply jacoblambda 13 hours agorootparent> I think urbanizing core metro areas is actually key to protecting rural areas. It really is. Some subruban and rual places are starting to get this as well. A common theme among the ones that get it is to provide density bonuses (i.e. if you allocate large blocks of conservation space, you can build more densely). The result is that you get the same overall density in an area but the people are living much closer together and not sprawling out and building over the natural environment. I personally think most of them are too conservative with their approaches (often setting upper limits on density even with the bonuses) but the general approach of \"build dense to limit the impact on rural spaces\" is progress. reply UtopiaPunk 12 hours agorootparentThere are some silly culture-war politics which makes reasonable discussions difficult. But also some of the politics problem is that a lot of these decisions are being made at the local town/city level. Small rural towns may try to dig in their heels and and resist urbanization (and the specific tactics involved are usually kind of bad, imo). Meanwhile, big cities often don't have strong incentives to not sprawl, at least in the US. Sprawl moves the costs of housing and transporation onto someone else (either the surrounding towns or the individuals), while the city maintains some portion of a tax base (sales tax and local businesses). Some cities have some political will to fight for these anyway, but even at the best of times, these policies have to make some harmful compromises. I think the most promising solutions to this problem are policies from state-level governments. reply ethanbond 12 hours agorootparentprevAbsolutely. The enemy of rural is suburbia, not urban development. Build moderate density city centers, ideally in the form of several small self-contained villages that happen to abut each other, and leave the surrounding area as legitimately rural as possible. reply al_borland 1 hour agoparentprevParking lot requirements make sense in areas where cars are the only viable means of transportation. Removing those requirements only makes sense when other forms of transportation are provided to reduce the number of cars required to get people to the places of business. Near me, the city is talking about removing a big parking lot and strip mall and turning it into a mixed use space, but as far as I’ve read there has been no talk of transportation. The area sits at the intersection of two stroads. It’s technically walkable, but it’s not a pleasant walk. It’s technically can be biked, but not without competing with cars for space on the road. There might be buses, but they are very infrequent and slow. Everyone I know would want to drive, as the alternatives are significantly worse than driving. If people can’t park, they simply won’t go. I’d love to get rid of my car, but that requires the city, and region, make significant investments in public transit infrastructure. The non-car option can’t just be available for those who are willing to put in a lot of effort to avoid using a car. The non-car options need to be better than the car option. Easier, cheaper, safer, and more pleasant. Removing parking lots makes driving worse, but doesn’t make the alternatives better. reply J_Shelby_J 14 hours agoparentprevIt should decrease housing costs as well. The rules in my area are two spots per bedroom - mandatory. But my building is in uptown Dallas and the main draw to the area is that people work in the area and walk to work. So many people don't own cars or are only a one home house hold. And because it's a highrise parking spots are expensive. Like $50k+ each. And that goes directly to the price of housing in rents.

With malls, you could come into a boundary and spend a significant amount of time in a walkable arena with lots of different stores. You knew there would always be parking except possibly at Christmas. Downtown? Not so much. And you probably had to pay for parking. And carry quarters for the meter. And risk getting parking tickets. etc. Malls were what all the anti-car people supposedly promise will happen when you remove cars.

I grew up in the suburbs of New Jersey and Maryland, spent a little time in my 20s in the denser-than-suburbs suburbia of the Bay Area, and then the past 14 years in San Francisco proper. More recently I've been spending 1-1.5 months at a time living out in \"rural\" parts of Truckee, CA. I just don't know anymore. In San Francisco I live within a few minutes' walk of two dozen or so useful businesses (corner store, grocery, bakery, butcher, restaurants, bars, etc.), and everything I need to live I can get by walking no more than a half hour. I hate driving and love this. In Truckee, the closest convenience store is a 40-minute walk, and all the other necessities are at least a 10-minute drive. On the other hand, I'm a light sleeper, and the intense darkness (moonlight, at most, only!) and quiet in Truckee was wonderful for restfulness. In SF we live near a Muni bus depot, where they clean buses well past midnight every night. I can mostly -- but not entirely -- get darkness with blackout blinds, but it's really not the same. I definitely don't want to go back to the suburbs, but that sort of thing -- with much better city planning than most (all?) US suburbs have -- has potential to give me quiet and darkness, but the ability to walk everywhere I need to go. Ultimately, though, what drives where I want to live is where my friends are.

We can't remove parking minimums because everyone needs a car because it's not walkable. But we can't take out the parking lots, because no one walks, because there's too many parking lots between the places people want to go. And we can't put in dedicated bus lanes, because that would reduce parking, which we need because buses are too slow. How do we break the cycle? reply crq-yml 6 hours agorootparentHere is what I see taking shape across a number of cities: 1. A big micromobility boom. This describes a number of phenomena: the e-bikes are perhaps the most visible since they add a lot of power to a bike commute and make it easier to justify doing big distances by bike. But equally, the docked bikeshares have found a foothold in many places big and small, and those help extend transit range quite a bit while creating an institutional platform for bike-friendly streets: the bikeshare services will always lobby for whatever makes them the best option. 2. The \"unbundled car\". This is something Tony Seba uses in his discussions on disruption: the car bundled a large number of services into one solution: \"get in the car and drive.\" Many of those solutions have transitioned to online, delivery, etc. So the car's raison d'etre is diminished today and diminishing further as we develop more alternatives. 3. The future rebundling of transport as a service. The first step in this was the reshuffling of taxi/delivery drivers to gig economy labor. This was probably too early and too reliant on zero interest rates, but one of the things that always courted investment in these businesses was that robotics could take over and perform self-driving. And while it's still not an evenly distributed phenomenon, Waymo exists. I have it on my phone. Waymo itself may not be the last word in how self-driving tech is deployed, but the tech will increasingly realign \"cars\" with \"transit\" by lowering the cost of professional vehicle operation. In the current US market, there's been a shortage of bus drivers, and scheduling them is a large pain point for deploying transit. You can't drop driver quality because of the liability involved in operating huge vehicles. Private autos have gotten away with a legal hack that normalizes poor driving by making the individual an owner-operator and blaming them for their inevitable failures. So the economics will work out that cars and fixed-route mass transit are still competitive, but you will get more mobility per dollar invested by adding self-drive to your transit system, because then high-quality driving and scheduling scales and you can flood the streets with both big and small transit vehicles. Therefore, in the future, city buses will run more frequently on more routes and at later hours. reply PeterisP 3 hours agorootparentprevYou can slowly, gradually reduce parking minimums. reply shiroiuma 8 hours agorootparentprevFor me, it was pretty simple: I packed up and moved to a walkable city (which meant leaving the US). The only way you're going to get a walkable city out of a non-walkable US city is to completely change the zoning laws, eliminate the free parking and making driving horribly inconvenient and expensive, then go through a cycle of death and rebirth as the city largely dies out and then gets revitalized a couple decades later.

Pretty much every argument I see against removing parking boils down to 'The city gets denser with more nice things to the point I can't drive my SUV there any more!'

Make street parking in those surrounding neighborhoods resident-only. And then people considering living in the \"underparked\" neighborhood who need parking will have no alternative but to select units that include parking, or live in another neighborhood (and if enough people opt not to live there, developers will include more parking to satisfy demand).

It's a pain for everyone involved. And you better never have a party where more than a couple people visit at once. reply FooBarBizBazz 10 hours agorootparentprevWhere I saw this, households would generally pay for a 2hr guest permit (maximum one per household, or maybe two) that they lend visitors to display in their windshield, and if someone needs to stay longer, then you pay for a temporary two-day guest permit at the parking office. Either way, the permit is used for street parking. Finding a spot can be a minor adventure but is usually doable. You may have to walk a block. If someone is visiting for longer then they probably need to pay for a spot in a parking garage, or just -- fly in and leave the car at home. reply _dain_ 13 hours agorootparentprevThis is the stated justification but it doesn't really correspond with reality.

As with most things, a lot of this comes down to money. The more dense an area, the more use the things you want are used, and the more money they make, they more likely they are to thrive. The more dense an area, the bigger the tax base, the more money there is for nice things that maybe don't make money on their own. reply baby 5 hours agoparentprevThe grid life in the US with large roads and few commercial streets really suck imo.

They close the public transit before the bars in almost every city across the country, and they ensure the bars are far enough away and restrictive enough that you have to drive. Then they tax the hell out of taxi services to ensure that there aren't enough cabs to take you home and rides can exceed $100 (which is a lot in most of the country by area, not population). It's zoned this way where bars and restaurants aren't near houses, in summary. If they did it like Spain, for example, where you can just walk out of your home, sit on the street at any restaurant, and drink wine with your friends, we'd have exactly what you're describing. But then they wouldn't be able to rake in DUI profits. reply dfxm12 11 hours agorootparentA city does not want drunk people crashing cars into infrastructure or murdering its inhabitants.

It's often a developer handout that results in a degraded standard of living for existing residents in the neighborhood around a new development. Let's say a developer builds a bigger, taller building than what was there previously and adds residents. If they're not required to include sufficient parking, the new cars will flood the surrounding neighborhood, and existing residents will now have no place to park. This depends on the type of neighborhood, of course, but it happened in mine in Chicago. Not being able to just come home and go inside, but rather have to drive around and around in ever-larger circles (in the winter) to look for a parking spot because some alderman got paid off by a developer to screw his constituents... that's the reality. We're seeing this in L.A. too, where local politicians will sell out to developers and publicly excuse it by pretending that parking creates cars and cars = bad. L.A. is a giant county masquerading as a city, and it's never going to be Amsterdam (you hear this asinine comparison all the time). Pretending that people aren't going to bring cars to their residence is absurd and damaging. But big vacant parking lots growing weeds? Hell yeah, we have those all over the place, around dying malls and boarded-up Macy's. But what did CA politicians do? Pass laws that allow developers to destroy one single-family home and build 10 units there, overriding any local zoning or review and without local ability to prevent it. So now we're going to pave over even MORE ground and cut down MORE trees, while said malls are still sitting there. As if the place isn't hot, barren, drought-stricken, and depressing enough.

Sometimes the space can be used to make room for transit, too. By making these places denser and more livable, it prevents even more trees, meadows, etc. from being cleared for more exurbs. I'd start with Suburban Nation, move on to StrongTowns and MissingMiddle, then take it from there. reply mytailorisrich 14 hours agoprevTrees are great to provide shade in parking lots.

And this wasn't because the market decided to do that, it's all been mandated by law. I think it's good to have a diversity of types of development. Just as people who don't want to drive shouldn't expect access to car-dependent environments to be easy, people in cars shouldn't expect the very few pockets of hard-won walkable environments to be optimal for driving into. reply matsemann 13 hours agoparentprev> where you either have to pay a fortune to park That's a good thing.

I no longer see a link to the Google cache within search result snippets but that doesn't mean you cannot access to cache, you can. Now when you click the three dots for more information for a search result snippet, the cache button is missing. Here is a screenshot Frank Sandtmann shared with me and he posted more on Mastodon: I tried this in several browsers and on two different internet connections and also no longer see the cache button. So how do you access the cache? Just Google [cache:domain.com] - so for example, this site - you can search for [https://www.google.com/search?q=cache:seroundtable.com]. Do you still see the cache link? Maybe I am in a test group still? Forum discussion at Mastodon. Copied!

There was a brief moment it had some good advice on products and services, until SEO jerks got wind of it and astroturfed over the whole thing. reply A_D_E_P_T 22 minutes agorootparentYeah, Reddit is the most astroturfed place on the internet. There's a thriving market in \"high karma\" accounts that are bought and sold by PR firms, SEO companies, and guerilla marketers -- and a huge fraction, if not an outright majority, of product-related posts are engineered from such sources with undisclosed interests. These days, it's one of the cheapest, and one of the \"best,\" ways to advertise. I don't think that Reddit was ever good. (The upvote/downvote system stifles real discussion, and even normal people treat it like a game -- exaggerating and making up stories for upvotes.)

I have absolutely no idea what's happening with Google's project managers these days, or whoever in the company is making product decisions. Thousands of highly intelligent and highly paid staff just keep making their core product and associated features increasingly user hostile. YouTube search is an absolute travesty. Google search just floods the first page with various cards that take up previously useful space and doesn't add value to the simple need to find answers to questions. I firmly believe that only relying on A/B testing for feature launches reached peak usefulness years ago.

They also list Google as an ancillary, as well as many others. But the \"feel\" is more from the UI, and the relevance of the results. Both of these ways Google completely fails on now. reply jfoutz 5 hours agorootparentprevthis makes me want to roll my own. But it's such a huge undertaking (maybe?).

Archive.Today also rate-limits submissions and will through up CAPTCHA tests if you're exceeding rates (though so long as you're retaining cookies, though seem to stay good for a while). I've archived 100s to low 1,000s of my own personal contributions on a few online services to both sites. For Archive Today, it is possible to expedite the archival process by generating the initial submission URL, though you'll have to complete another two steps after that point manually as I recall. If you're archiving a large set of sites, you can compile a list, generate a Web page off of that, and work through it at a pretty good clip. ________________________________ Notes: 1.

    "title": "Covid Test Provider's Data Breach Exposes 1.3M Patient Records, Including PII",
    "originLink": "https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/report-coronalab-breach/",
    "originBody": "COVID Test Data Breach: 1.3 Million Patient Records Exposed Online Jeremiah Fowler Published on 22nd January 2024 Cybersecurity researcher Cybersecurity Researcher, Jeremiah Fowler, discovered and reported to vpnMentor about a non-password protected database that contained nearly 1.3 million records, which included COVID-19 testing information and personally identifiable information such as the patient’s name, date of birth, and passport number. The publicly exposed database contained an estimated 1.3 million records that included 118,441 certificates, 506,663 appointments, 660,173 testing samples, and a small number of internal application files. The exposed certificates and other documents were all marked with the name and logo of Coronalab.eu. Although the website appears to be offline, Coronalab is owned by Microbe & Lab, an ISO-certified laboratory based in Amsterdam, Netherlands. According to the NL Times, “CoronaLab is one of the two largest commercial test providers in the Netherlands”. I sent multiple responsible disclosure notices and did not receive any reply and several phone calls also yielded no results. The database remained open for nearly 3 weeks before I contacted the cloud hosting provider and it was finally secured from public access. In most cases the organization replies or closes public access immediately after receiving a responsible disclosure notice. Another research-based online publication, Cybernews, claimed to have found a similar leak around the same time of my discovery. I cannot confirm if it's related or not. The exposed COVID test records contained each patient’s name, nationality, passport number, and test results, as well as the price, location, and type of test conducted. The database also contained thousands of QR codes and hundreds of.csv files that showed appointment details and many patients’ email addresses. With personal data and emails exposed, cybercriminals could attempt to exploit this information or launch targeted phishing campaigns using internal information or posing as a laboratory employee. The criminal could potentially reference test dates, locations, or other insider information that only the patient and the laboratory would know. Any potential exposure involving COVID test data combined with PII could potentially compromise the personal and medical privacy of the individuals listed in the documents. According to the Microbe & Lab website: Coronalab.eu is an online platform which helps individuals and companies to test for COVID-19. We do this with a fast COVID test service (PCR test, the Rapid test and the Serological test) with which we can guarantee same day results. Tests include a free travel certificate. During the height of the pandemic, proof of a negative COVID test was required for nearly all everyday life activities. In many cases, testing was often mandatory for travel, special events, and even employment. There was a massive amount of COVID test data collected in a short period of time, which needed to be accessible for patients or verifications, yet still secure from unauthorized access. Even under normal conditions, data and cloud storage infrastructure takes time to build, test, and properly configure. The speed of the pandemic and the massive amount of testing data forced many laboratories and medical facilities around the world to rush the process. This increased the risk for permission and configuration errors in data storage and data protection. In my professional opinion, now that the pandemic is mostly behind us, it is time for organizations to review the massive amounts of data they have stored and determine if these records are still needed. If they are, organizations must ensure the data is secured from unauthorized access. The records should be encrypted or anonymized to prevent unwanted data exposures or threats from malicious actors. This screenshot shows a positive COVID test certificate that includes the name, date of birth, passport number, and nationality of the patient. This screenshot shows an example of an exposed QR code as well as the information that appeared on my phone once it opened. The data (including the patient’s PII) appeared in plain text — no password or specialized software needed, just a regular smartphone’s camera. The database included.csv files indicating names, emails, test results, pricing, dates, and internal logging information. This screenshot shows an archive snapshot of the coronalab.eu website that now appears to be offline and returns a 404 error. Possible risks of this exposure Leaked COVID-19 test results could potentially turn into a breach of personal and health information, compromising the individual privacy of those who may have been affected. The issue of COVID became a contentious political issue full of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and social repercussions that divided people around the world. Many people still don’t want to disclose their vaccine status or if they previously tested positive for COVID for fear of stigmatization. It is not known if anyone else gained access to the exposed COVID test data. The public exposure of COVID tests has a range of potential future risks due to the fact that so much is still unknown about the long-term health effects of the virus, and we don’t know how pandemic-era data could be used years later. Hypothetically, insurers could raise premium rates if research showed that those who were infected with the virus had a higher risk of future health issues. Overall, leaked COVID test results not only pose risks to personal and medical privacy, but they could also affect how patients view public healthcare providers and how much they trust them to safeguard their medical data. It's crucial for healthcare organizations and technology providers to prioritize data security, including data storage and cybersecurity measures. Another important issue healthcare providers must face is to implement clear record retention policies to determine how long medical records should be kept and how to prevent the risks associated with data that is no longer being actively used. A passport is a government-issued identity document that contains information intended to be private. Exposed passport details — such as the document number, full name, date of birth, and nationality — could be potentially valuable pieces of information for identity thieves and cyber criminals. Passport data has the potential to be misused for various fraudulent activities, ranging from travel-related fraud (such as booking flights, renting cars, or hotel reservations) to opening financial accounts in the passport holder's name. I am not implying that the people whose passports were exposed were ever at imminent risk; I only mean to provide a real-world example of potential repercussions. The database contained a large number of test result QR codes. A Quick Response (QR) code can store various types of data, such as website URLs, text, contact information, or commands. Nearly every phone camera can scan a QR code without any additional software. When QR codes store and transmit sensitive data (such as personal details, passport data, and medical test results) in plain text, the codes represent a potential security risk in case they are publicly exposed. In this instance, I was able to scan numerous QR codes and see the test results and all the confidential personal data they contained. As useful and as user friendly as QR codes are, they can be a major security risk. For example, the codes can be easily changed to redirect users to fake websites or prompt them to download malware or other malicious applications. I highly recommend any organization that uses QR codes containing personal information to implement proper security measures to safeguard sensitive data. Encrypting the information, for instance, can help prevent potential threats to privacy and security. It is unknown how long the data was publicly exposed or if anyone else may have accessed the thousands of COVID-related records. Only an internal forensic audit would identify if others may have accessed the database or performed any other suspicious activity. It is also unclear if customers, patients, or the authorities have been notified of the data incident. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs data protection and privacy for individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). Medical data, including COVID test results, are classified as sensitive personal data or as a special type of personal data under the GDPR regulations. Organizations who collect and store medical data must adhere to the GDPR's stringent requirements regarding data protection, ensuring confidentiality and security when processing potentially sensitive information. This also includes the technical measures to safeguard data against unauthorized access or any public data exposure. As an ethical researcher, I never download the data I discover. I only access a minimal sample for verification purposes and redact PII for privacy. Although all records were marked with names and logos of Coronalab and Microbe & Lab, it is unknown who owned or managed the database. I imply no wrongdoing by Microbe & Lab, CoronaLab.eu, or any of their partners or affiliates. Furthermore, I do not imply that patients or data are at imminent risk. I publish my findings to raise awareness and underscore the importance of cybersecurity best practices.

AT&T wanted it from me to add a phone on a business account that was shipping to our physical address, which has not ever changed since the account was opened. eBay wanted it (and my SSN! and my wife's!) despite our account being a business account registered with an EIN and connected to a business bank account.

But they normalized this behavior when moving to mobile apps for netbanks by requiring people to photograph their IDs and take selfies for KYC. After all this KYC stuff, photographing personal documents became normal and then many other big tech companies started requiring this stuff. I think even Facebook started asking people to send pictures of IDs to verify accounts. I know phone companies in EU started doing this. I still refuse doing it for all these trivial services and it has a real cost in that it prevents me from using several services. At some point I will probably have to do it. In my country, we recently had a real estate agency who got hacked and had all their KYC stuff exposed and sold for ID theft. It is a huge mess. The company then reached out to all the persons that were affected by mail telling them that this happened and that they should contact them immediately. So I contacted them.

Yes, CNN is biased up the wazoo. But at that point it rationally didn't matter the cause, but nipping this in the bud the best we could. The cause, and even lists of potential causes, are important to prevent future patient zeroes. And given all of the crap that's happened with wildlife to human transmission in the past (SARS 1, MERS, metapneumovirus, bird flu, swine flu, mpox, hemorrhagic viruses) there are other important avenues of transmission to deal with in addition to safe laboratory and sample collection practices. > I remember press conferences telling vaccinated people not to hug their unvaccinated loved ones. Why not when it's 100%, 95%, 90%, kind of%, maybe% effective? Injected vaccination (getting a shot into your muscle) was only really going to help with duration of symptoms (potentially shutting COVID down when it's just the sniffles, if you're lucky). It's much worse at preventing transmission than mucosal vaccination is. If you want to protect others, wear a mask. If you want to protect yourself, a quality mask is better, but a vaccine is okay. > and there's a reason it just disappeared almost overnight. Yeah, I was really pissed when the California government dropped both masking and social distancing at the same time, just in time for Delta to hit, once the first vaccines had been out for ~ 3 months. I'm also pissed at the wishy-washyness of talking heads when asked whether masks are recommended again around the holiday season. Well fitting and well used masks are superior to vaccination.

Toronto forced masking months before it was forced across the entire province of Ontario. The \"unvaccinated\" people, including those who were perfectly healthy the entire time, also faced significant discrimination and harm into late 2022, well after it was obvious that many people who'd taken numerous shots were still getting sick. Also, a significant number of people lost jobs, lost their businesses, lost educational opportunities, were prevented from visiting with dying loved ones, were prevented from holding and/or attending funerals, and otherwise suffered other irreparable damage. Maybe you lucked out and were in an area where the restrictions weren't too bad. That certainly wasn't the case for everybody, though. Lots of people went through prolonged and completely unnecessary suffering, and they will never forget how they were harmed. reply bearjaws 16 hours agoparentprev [–] So the company getting hacked isn't to blame?

Most people at this point are going to infer that you have some kind of problem with the pandemic response, whether they agree with you or not. So, that's likely the dogwhistle being referred to here.

    "originBody": "February 1, 2024 15 min read Inside the Crime Rings Trafficking Sand Organized crime is mining sand from rivers and coasts to feed demand worldwide, ruining ecosystems and communities. Can it be stopped? By David A. Taylor Credit: Mark Smith February 2024 Issue Ethics Transnational security investigator Abdelkader Abderrahmane set out from the Moroccan city of Kenitra with two research assistants to inspect sand-mining sites on the Atlantic Ocean coast. They drove across the dry, flat terrain for six kilometers, the last stretch on a rutted dirt road that had them crawling in low gear, windows closed against the hot dust. The beach dunes where they were headed lay beyond a rise. As they approached, a man wearing a gendarme cap suddenly appeared to their right, speeding toward them on an all-terrain vehicle. With angry gestures, he forced them to a stop. “Why are you here?!” he demanded. “There's nowhere to go.” One assistant said they just wanted to visit the beach and the nearby tourist camp. The gendarme shook his head: no further. They turned around and began to creep back down the rough road, but as soon as the gendarme was out of sight they turned off and snuck along a hidden side of the ridge. About 400 meters further they stopped and cut the engine. Abderrahmane walked quietly to the crest of the bluff to peer down, keeping low to avoid being seen. Despite all his research into illegal sand mines, he was unprepared for the scene below. Half a dozen dump trucks scattered across a deeply pitted moonscape were filled high with brown sand. Just beyond lay the light blue sea. Abderrahmane was stunned by the “major disfiguration” of the dunes, he told me later on a video call. “It was a shock.” Part of his shock came from the sight of desecrated nature, but part came from seeing the brazenness of trucks hauling sand in full daylight. “You cannot illegally mine sand in daylight if you don't have people helping you,” he says—people in high places. “Big companies are being protected, perhaps by ministers or deputy ministers or whoever. It's a whole system.” Everyone in the sand-trafficking market “benefits from it, from top to bottom.” On supporting science journalism If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

For the past 15 years the slender, bespectacled Abderrahmane has studied environmental trade and crime for the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), an African research and policy advisory organization based in South Africa. ISS papers showed how environmental degradation can fuel tensions among people and compromise security. But until a few years ago Abderrahmane had never heard of sand trafficking. He had been in Mali doing fieldwork on the drug trade when a source noted that most cannabis in Mali came from Morocco and that sand trafficking was also a major market in that country, with drug traffickers involved. “I think that when you talk about sand trafficking, most people would not believe it,” Abderrahmane says. “Me included. Now I do.” Very few people are looking closely at the illegal sand system or calling for changes, however, because sand is a mundane resource. Yet sand mining is the world's largest extraction industry because sand is a main ingredient in concrete, and the global construction industry has been soaring for decades. Every year the world uses up to 50 billion metric tons of sand, according to a United Nations Environment Program report. The only natural resource more widely consumed is water. A 2022 study by researchers at the University of Amsterdam concluded that we are dredging river sand at rates that far outstrip nature's ability to replace it, so much so that the world could run out of construction-grade sand by 2050. The U.N. report confirms that sand mining at current rates is unsustainable. The greatest demand comes from China, which used more cement in three years (6.6 gigatons from 2011 through 2013) than the U.S. used in the entire 20th century (4.5 gigatons), notes Vince Beiser, author of The World in a Grain. Most sand gets used in the country where it is mined, but with some national supplies dwindling, imports reached $1.9 billion in 2018, according to Harvard's Atlas of Economic Complexity. Companies large and small dredge up sand from waterways and the ocean floor and transport it to wholesalers, construction firms and retailers. Even the legal sand trade is hard to track. Two experts estimate the global market at about $100 billion a year, yet the U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summaries indicates the value could be as high as $785 billion. Sand in riverbeds, lake beds and shorelines is the best for construction, but scarcity opens the market to less suitable sand from beaches and dunes, much of it scraped illegally and cheaply. With a shortage looming and prices rising, sand from Moroccan beaches and dunes is sold inside the country and is also shipped abroad, using organized crime's extensive transport networks, Abderrahmane has found. More than half of Morocco's sand is illegally mined, he says. Luis Fernando Ramadon, a federal police specialist in Brazil who studies extractive industries, estimates that the global illegal sand trade ranges from $200 billion to $350 billion a year—more than illegal logging, gold mining and fishing combined. Buyers rarely check the provenance of sand; legal and black market sand look identical. Illegal mining rarely draws heat from law enforcement because it looks like legitimate mining—trucks, backhoes and shovels—there's no property owner lodging complaints, and officials may be profiting. For crime syndicates, it's easy money. The environmental impacts are substantial. Dredging rivers destroys estuaries and habitats and exacerbates flooding. Scraping coastal ecosystems churns up vegetation, soil and seabeds and disrupts marine life. In some countries, illegal mining makes up a large portion of the total activity, and its environmental impacts are often worse than those of legitimate operators, Beiser says, all to build cities on the cheap. Questionable mining happens worldwide. In the early 1990s in San Diego County, California, officials stopped mining from the San Luis Rey River, only to see operators move across the border into Baja California to plunder riverbeds there. Until a few years ago, a mine north of Monterey, Calif., operated by Cemex, a global construction company, was pulling more than 270,000 cubic meters of sand every year from the beach, operating in a legal gray zone. That was the last beach mine in the U.S., shut down in 2020 by grassroots pressure. Mining in rivers and deltas, however, is still going strong throughout the U.S., not all of it legal.

Sverdrup et al., in BioPhysical Economics and Resource Quality, Vol. 2; May 2017 (data) Sand is any hard, granular material—stones, shells, whatever—between 0.0625 and two millimeters in diameter. Fine-quality sand is used in glass, and still-finer grades appear in solar panels and silicon chips for electronics. Desert sand typically consists of grains rounded like tiny marbles from constant weathering. The best sand for construction, however, has angular grains, which helps concrete mixtures bind. River sand is preferable to coastal sand, partly because coastal sand has to be washed free of salt. But coastal sand does get used, especially when builders take shortcuts, leading to buildings that have shorter life spans and pose greater risks for inhabitants. Such shortcuts worsened the damage from the disastrous February 2023 earthquake that shook Turkey and Syria, says Mette Bendixen, a physical geographer at McGill University who has investigated the effects of sand mining since 2017. I was first alerted to sand mafias by Louise Shelley, who leads the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University. Shelley realized sand mining could be a natural evolution of organized crime when, five years ago, she was a guest at a NATO lunch conference held near the Pentagon. A top NATO official approached her to talk about illegal fishing off West Africa, saying it posed a serious threat to European and NATO security. They talked about how the low threshold for entry into an environmental crime such as wildlife poaching can draw criminal rings and then lead them into other types of organized environmental crime, such as illegal logging. Sand mining was another case in point. Shelley says in northwestern Africa there is a confluence of trafficking factors: the region offers entry to European markets, and its mosaic of fragile governments, terrorist groups and corrupt international corporations makes it vulnerable. In addition to social instability, Shelley is concerned about sand mining's “devastating environmental impacts.” Stripping away sand removes nature's physical system for holding water, with huge effects for people's way of life. River sand acts like a sponge, helping to replenish the entire watershed after dry spells; if too much sand is removed, natural replenishment can no longer sustain the river, which aggravates water supply for people and leads to loss of vegetation and wildlife. Harvesting has removed so much sand from Asia's Mekong Delta that the river system is drying up. Removing sand from coasts makes land that already faces sea-level rise even more exposed. Abderrahmane saw this in Morocco when he drove north from Rabat to Larache, known as “the balcony of the Atlantic.” The town, which looks out over 50-meter-high cliffs toward the sea, is a hub of Morocco's thriving fishing industry. A 2001 government document known as the Plan Azur proposed greater protection of nature in many places in the country scoured for sand, including Larache. But in his 2021 field research, Abderrahmane found that the dark sand and rock-strewn beach there was rife with mining. Teams of workers loaded up donkeys with saddle packs full of sand, leaving stony craters at the water's edge. They goaded the donkeys up footpaths torn into the soft, steep bluffs to trucks waiting above to haul the illicit material to various concrete production sites. In Mozambique, increasingly destructive flash flooding has hit the town of Nagonha, which lies on the Indian Ocean. Elders there told Amnesty International they can't recall any comparable flooding in the past, before the Hainan Haiyu Mining Company started operations in 2011, harvesting sand and minerals such as ilmenite, titanium and zircon from the dunes. The company dumped leftover sand across a wide area, spreading it to make a level working surface, which buried existing vegetation and blocked drainage, according to an Amnesty International report. The company's procedures failed to comply with Mozambican law, changed the flow of fresh water and are blamed for making Nagonha more vulnerable to the flash floods that have partly destroyed it, Amnesty International reported. One flood washed 48 homes into the sea, slicing a channel through the dunes, leaving nearly 300 people homeless. One man described to Amnesty International how his family's two-bedroom house vanished: “We felt the house collapsing, and we ran for our lives” as he saw their home “being dragged by the water.” Sand looting is changing the hydrology of entire rivers. Halinishi Yusuf experienced this as a girl growing up in Kenya. She also witnessed mining's violent excess and eventually helped to bring it under control. Credit: John Knight; Sources: Transnational Crime and the Developing World, by Channing May, Global Financial Integrity, March 2017 (crime data); “The Global Estimated Value of Illegal Sand Extraction,” by Luis Fernando Ramadon, SandStories.org (sand extraction estimate) Yusuf, now studying sand mining and river systems as a Ph.D. candidate at Newcastle University in England, was born in Makueni County, southeast of Nairobi. As a girl, she carried water from the river, and like most residents, her family relied on rain-fed farming to eke out a living. But seasonal rains became erratic as a result of several interconnected climate patterns, and local farming and jobs declined. As life got harder, residents turned to harvesting sand for the construction boom in Nairobi. It was an easy form of employment because no investment was required except a shovel. Yusuf went away for high school in the early 2000s, and when she visited home, she saw trucks parked in the riverbed, loading up. Residents worked as loaders, and vendors sold food to the crews. Any river or tributary was fair game: if it gathered sand, it was exploited, and it wasn't illegal. Yusuf didn't connect the mining to environmental damage. “It was just sand, anyway,” she says about her outlook back then. And the trade pumped cash into the economy; the village “was vibrant,” Yusuf told me on a video call. But damage to river systems was becoming clear. Groundwater levels were sinking; riverbeds stripped of sand didn't hold water and failed to refresh aquifers underground. Farmers already struggling couldn't irrigate their crops. Social tensions grew heated. Under Kenya's “devolution” of public services from the national government to the country's 47 counties, local agencies took responsibility for sand-harvesting licenses, often without resources to manage it. The process was unregulated and soon overwhelmed. To try to stop the chaos, Makueni County passed a law in 2015 creating a local sand authority. But from 2015 to 2017 violence over sand wracked the area, leaving at least nine people dead and dozens injured. Even legal actors operated clandestinely, and local governments exploited permit fees, Yusuf says. “No one was frowning on this activity.” Other counties had similar conflicts, but in Makueni a small group of sand loaders changed course and became vigilantes. They realized that mining was worsening arid conditions and that only outsiders were profiting. They saw officials getting rich from bribes and construction teams hauling the county's sand wealth elsewhere. The group vowed to stop trucks no matter what it took. It imposed its ban on trucks leaving the area by torching offenders. Late one December night in 2016 two Kenyan truck drivers met a horrible death when they were parked beside the Muooni River, loading sand right out of the riverbed after midnight. The vigilantes surrounded them and set the trucks on fire. Both drivers died, burned “beyond recognition,” police reported to local media. Not all the local people wanted to stop the lucrative business, however, and two factions clashed, resulting in more deaths. The Nairobi transport network poured cash into the pro-mining faction. “The conflict was funded from outside by the sand cartel in Nairobi,” Yusuf says, and law enforcement failed to intervene. The violence and damage to the rivers peaked in mid-2017, around when Yusuf left Nairobi, where she had been working on fisheries management. She returned home to lead the Makueni County Sand Authority, which had made little headway. When applying for the job, Yusuf made her soft skills a selling point. She said she would enforce the 2015 law but noted that “there's a palatable way of making the community start appreciating why we need to do this.” Credit: Mark Smith When she began the job, she called a morning meeting in Muooni with local stakeholders. The village administrator and elders spread the word. Several dozen people toting plastic chairs gathered at the Muooni River, where mining was rampant, and sat in the shade. Yusuf had rehearsed her spoken Kikamba, the local language. Although she had taken part in stakeholder meetings in her fisheries job, she had never led one like this. “The entire county is watching,” she thought at the time. “I have to bring it forward.” Yusuf explained to her audience how sand supports water in dry areas and how water gets replenished. She said the sand was like a sponge that made water available for them and the ecosystem. “Where there is sand, there is water,” she told them. During the discussion residents became reassured that they could gain income from sand while also allowing it to recharge the water supply. Over the next five years, under Yusuf's leadership, the sand authority gained trust. It prosecuted the worst offenders and imposed strict fines on illicit mining. Yusuf's strategy was threefold. First, she used government power to stop sand from leaving the county. The authority allowed permits only for local construction projects: no more trucks from Nairobi. Second, Yusuf continued a series of meetings with local groups at the rivers. Finally, she made her office's books public and used that transparency to show that half the revenue from licensing fees went straight to river restoration projects. People aiming to flout the controls backed off. Shady syndicates from Nairobi no longer had effective local agents in Makueni and found it easier to source their sand elsewhere. For the first time, sand revenues produced visible local benefits. Projects ranged from “sand dams”—concrete weirs across the riverbed that catch sand pushed downstream by the rains—to “water sumps,” concrete tanks sunk several meters below the riverbed, used to draw drinking water. Leaving riverbeds untouched for even one rainy season (Kenya has two rainy seasons a year) allowed upstream sediment to replenish the controlled withdrawals, according to Yusuf. The community saw that there could be a way of life beyond selling sand to outsiders. Change is harder in places where local groups lack the power to manage resources. In Morocco, Abderrahmane found a wide range of people profiting from the clandestine system, from local workers to high officials. The few people who protested were intimidated. French documentarian Sophie Bontemps experienced this in 2021 when her crew was filming at dunes near El Jadida. Police arrested them for filming, Bontemps told me, interrogated them for a full day, and confiscated their equipment. That evening a military colonel working with two plainclothes officials arranged a mock trial in a hotel; near midnight they forced the crew members to sign a document in Arabic admitting they had no right to film and to erase their footage. Finally, they were released. (The team had saved the footage elsewhere.) To Bontemps, it was clear that national officials were involved in sand trafficking. Her film, Morocco: Raiding on the Sand, reports incidents of local protesters being threatened and beaten. Credit: Mark Smith Abderrahmane was finding it difficult to clarify the range of corruption. Sand mined for nearby buildings might fly below the radar of local officials. But long-haul transport involving scores of trucks traveling long distances on a public highway could not escape notice. In Larache, he couldn't count on government support, so he took a gamble. His team posed as real-estate developers seeking contractors for a big project in Casablanca, more than 200 kilometers south. At a compound where massive reddish sand piles signaled construction supply, one of Abderrahmane's assistants entered through a corrugated metal gate late in the day, when trucks were back from deliveries. He made bidding inquiries for a fictitious building project. He was stunned by the response: bidders could mobilize hundreds of trucks and front-end loaders within a week. “That would be very easy,” one man told him. On other days the assistant directly approached drivers of sand-laden trucks parked downtown. From the driver's seat, one transporter explained that contractors could arrange night hauling with up to 250 trucks through a syndicate of firms. Once the sand got delivered, construction companies mixed trafficked sand with legal sources. The contractor's confidence that they could deliver such volumes across great distances, requiring large loads to pass at least 10 highway checkpoints, indicated multiple layers of official collusion, Abderrahmane says. Because local people often struggle to push back against big syndicates, international pressure can push governments to prosecute traffickers. In Morocco, a strategy would likely require stronger environmental regulations, promotion of sustainable practices and transnational enforcement. An international certification system akin to the Forest Stewardship Council's process for timber sourcing is still only in the discussion phase, says Pascal Peduzzi of the U.N. Environment Program. But Abderrahmane's Moroccan sources say the government might consider action if sites were certified by the Convention on Wetlands, an international process dating back to the 1970s and observed by most U.N. member countries. A country submits a list of wetlands for accreditation, and if the international body overseeing the convention grants it, the wetlands can be monitored by an independent advisory committee to help ensure the site is preserved and not plundered. New technology might help distinguish whether sand came from a legal or illegal operation; in 2023 researchers from several universities demonstrated an optical system that can fingerprint sand grains, allowing them to be traced back to their site of origin. Before conservationist Rachel Carson created a narrative in the 20th century for water and air pollution in Silent Spring, the general public had little context for seeing streams or the sky as health threats. Journalist Beiser told me he thinks a similar situation exists for sand. George Mason's Shelley is encouraged by a new generation's energy for the problem. When we spoke, she was reading student papers about illicit environmental trade, happy that many of the students are career professionals in agencies where they can make a difference. Often it takes fresh eyes to change things, and Yusuf and Abderrahmane may inspire other people who are concerned about the environment and abuse of local communities. More research will help build cases against crime rings. The number of sand studies presented at the American Geophysical Union's annual conference grew from two in 2018 to more than 20 in 2023, McGill's Bendixen says. That research can eventually yield better mapping of sand flows, showing hotspots and illegal activity. Bendixen was heartened that the African Futures Conference in 2023 devoted a special session to sand extraction. “The time is running out for sand,” she says. “More people from as many different angles as possible are shouting out to the world, ‘We have an issue!' I think it's one of the most understudied global challenges of the 21st century.” From Our Archives Deep-Sea Dilemma. Olive Heffernan; September 2023. ScientificAmerican.com/archive David A.

Fire limestone to get lime, add fly ash and other additives for increased strength. Ratio of Water to Cement is important to get a complete reaction, but dont add too much water. Aggregate - angular aggregates provide the cement something to stick to and distribute the stresses evenly. You want a well graded aggregate, including sand particles up to larger chunks of rock. In my part of the world the aggregate is typically crushed limestone. Add clean sand for different mixes. There are other chemical additives that will increase strength, workability, and the speed of cure. Since reaction of water to cement is exothermic - on the really high tech monolithic pours they're using technology to carry away the waste heat. You want the whole mass to be at the same temperature to reduce the internal stresses. There are actually spherical glass orbs you can add to your concrete if you want it light-weight.

In a matter of minutes, it can produce “highly viscous, unmanageable concrete mixtures”.[32] These problems were faced with Portland cement as well, leading to the development of mix designs and admixtures that increase workability; to a limited extent, those techniques can be applied to geopolymer binder. reply namibj 2 hours agorootparentAnd in Roman times, concrete was laid in lifts like how foundation soil is handled today. Yeah, it's more effort than just pouring a thick soup into a vibrating mould, but e.g. precast slabs could handle a non-pourable paste.

You use tie in rods of rebar to bind one slab to another, not the aggregate because the aggregate does sh*t all for structural strength. It's more for the compressive strength. Tbh you can make a form or concrete out of perlite and cement. It's light af, great for ship hulls when reinforced with steel. Still concrete,just doesn't need any sand. reply margalabargala 12 hours agorootparent> Cement binds and aggregate shape doesn't count for bugger all. This isn't true at all. Using your example of rebar, this is why any piece of rebar has lugs down it; to bond better with the cement. If you use a smooth cylinder of steel, it won't bind to the cement as well and you wind up with a weaker finished product. The ribs of the rebar increase the surface area and make the rebar-cement bond stronger. Same thing with desert sand. If you have rounded sand grains, you've got reduced surface area per unit volume, and thus reduce the strength of the bond between the aggregate and the cement. That weaker bond becomes a fracture point. reply eszed 13 hours agorootparentprevThanks. Yeah, I've poured a few slabs and built a few walls, but construction engineering is waaay out of my normal competencies, so I appreciate the vocabulary corrections. You say \"aggregate shape doesn't count for bugger all\". So why does river / crushed sand work, and desert sand doesn't? It sounds more like there are different aggregate mixes / types of aggregate material that work for particular applications (hadn't thought that through, but it makes perfect sense), and that \"rough\" sand is better for the most-common concrete use-cases. Do you know of specific types of concrete where \"smooth\" sand would be preferred? reply gtvwill 12 hours agorootparentSomeone covers it further down. There's a whole bunch more to the strength of concrete than the aggregate. Man last major concreting I did smooth sand would have been awesome. We were already trying to use the finest grade sand we could find. It was on mad max 4. Making concrete not look like concrete (think underwater caverns, cliffs, waterfalls). So smooth is awesome, makes it easy to texture to look like different types of weathered rock. All the structural strength was from steel rebar with chook mesh wired to it. The crete and scratch coats were about 100mm thick at the most. reply MootheCat 14 hours agorootparentprevSelling sand to the Arabs is a thing. Their sand is too fine if I remember correctly. reply 1-more 13 hours agorootparenttoo smooth too. Windblown desert sand has smooth grains that won't adhere inside of the concrete mix. Sand grains from water have been slowed down by the water when hitting one another, so the grains have jagged parts.

So on the one hand it's an impending ecological disaster, and on the other its an economic catastrophe reply mattigames 3 hours agorootparentAll fair points except the one about \"evenly distribute into a near infinite volume of sand\", which makes no sense since you would obviously target the zones being used by the crime rings themselves, of course you can't find them all but if the risk of mining useless sand becomes big enough it may stop being economically attractive for those criminals. reply namaria 35 minutes agorootparentSo to apply your solution, assuming there is such a product and it has zero negative impacts, we'd need first find an illegal mining operation with certainty and reach it with a lot of man power.

At an aggregate mine located in Brazil, the total expenses are $80-$160 per ton [1]. The price of sand at home depot is 5.96 for a 50lb bag, $238 per ton.

(Assuming an infinite number of routes and no change in cost per distance) reply maxglute 5 hours agorootparentI think, unqualified speculation, transportation cost scales linearly because most economical exploitation past shores is along river/waterway sand, hence exploitation will be not be squared. Squaring coverage territory, as in getting sand from land introduces land shipping, which is even less efficient because cost per distance is subject to geography. Unless, engineered sand comes from coastal infra that takes regional inputs and pipes it strait onto barges, which also makes sense.
