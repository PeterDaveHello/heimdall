Node.js will transpile TypeScript source code into JavaScript source code. During the transpilation process, no type checking is performed, and types are discarded. Roadmap Refs: nodejs/loaders#217 Motivation I believe enabling users to execute TypeScript files is crucial to move the ecosystem forward, it has been requested on all the surveys, and it simply cannot be ignored. We must acknowledge users want to run node foo.ts without installing external dependencies or loaders. There is a TC39 proposal for type annotations Why type stripping Type stripping as the name suggest, means removing all the types, transform the input in a JavaScript module. const foo: string = \"foo\"; Becomes: const foo = \"foo\"; Other runtimes also perform transformation of some TypeScript only features into JavaScript, for example enums, which do not exists in JavaScript. At least initially in this PR no trasformation is performed, meaning that using Enum, namespaces etc... will not be possible. Why I chose @swc/wasm-typescript Because of simplicity. I have considered other tools but they require either rust or go to be added to the toolchain. @swc/wasm-typescript its a small package with a wasm and a js file to bind it. Swc is currently used by Deno for the same purpose, it's battle tested. In the future I see this being implemented in native layer. Massive shoutout to @kdy1 for releasing a swc version for us. ⚠ Refer to the PR changes in typescript.md for implementation details and limitations. 423 11 88 176 127 35 Collaborator nodejs-github-bot commented Review requested: @nodejs/actions @nodejs/gyp @nodejs/loaders @nodejs/security-wg @nodejs/tsc nodejs-github-bot added lib / src needs-ci labels marco-ippolito mentioned this pull request module: add --experimental-strip-types marco-ippolito/node#2 Closed marco-ippolito added the semver-minor label legendecas reviewed View reviewed changes Member legendecas left a comment • edited Choose a reason for hiding this comment The reason will be displayed to describe this comment to others.

This is something we definitely want look into, to be able to maintain compatibility with what you run and what you compile. It's in the checklist for future iterations, it might be resolved with extensions guessing (?), it requires further discussion. 7 Member panva commented This is something we definitely want look into Glad it's on your mind then!

It's still in Stage 1 so it will take at least a few years but I hope v8 will implement the api to make it happen 🔥 Member GeoffreyBooth commented • edited Resolution of import specifiers isn’t specific to module type, so we can’t have extension searching just for TypeScript files; and for many reasons we don’t support it in ESM. However it’s not necessary: users should write their import specifiers with .ts extensions, like import './file.ts', and there’s https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#allowImportingTsExtensions allowImportingTsExtensions to support this via tsconfig.json. Such behavior also aligns us with Deno. If the user wants to use the same source files both run directly via this new flag and run as transpiled JavaScript output by a build tool, it would be the responsibility of the build tool to convert file.ts into file.js; but this is something that build tools are more than capable of handling. marco-ippolito force-pushed the feat/typescript-support branch from e7d70d7 to 7a22f7f Compare Member joyeecheung commented There are two aspects of TypeScript support here: Stripping the syntax (i.e. essentially polyfilling the type annotation as syntax proposal) Modify the resolution rules so that .ts files are accepted, with 1 applied (and as @panva mentioned, allow e.g. import 'foo' to resolve to /path/to/foo/something.ts) AFAICT this does both (although the second one does it in a limited way), so that brings up the question on whether we want to make this this unflagged eventually. If we want to unflag it eventually then 2 is going to be a breaking change for existing TypeScript loaders that also try to modify the resolution rules in their own way, then we should only strip the syntax for files with explicit formats but don't try to override the resolution rules. If we want to keep it flagged as --strip-syntax eventually, then doing 2 is fine, though we might want to warn that it would be in conflict with other TypeScript loaders that actually do more like supporting enums.

Imports are either extensionless or use .js one (see point 2). To complicate things even further ESMs resolution in TypeScript is mostly achieved in codebases by adding .js extension to imports even if the .js file at that path does not exist. https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules/theory.html#module-resolution-for-libraries This is especially important in library code (as many projects out of there simply opt-out of ESM entirely and either create bundles FE-wise, or they compile down to CJS for Node ones) but the number of real world products using this pattern increases consistently every day with CJS being phased out by an ever growing number of projects. I wonder whether the flag could strip types and run @swc/wasm-typescript on files regardless of their extension. If it is a normal js file it will simply not need to strip anything (albeit it will still have to parse it). 11 marco-ippolito force-pushed the feat/typescript-support branch from f6fd494 to 206457c Compare Member Author marco-ippolito commented • edited This is neat, I'd like to see extensionless imports work if possible, but I also think this can land as-is and those issues fixed before making it stable. @benjamingr this is currently not possible because of this mandatory-file-extensions, it really depends on the esm loader.

    "commentBody": "Node.js adds experimental support for TypeScript (github.com/nodejs)900 points by magnio 16 hours agohidepastfavorite410 comments zarzavat 12 hours agoOne thing to note is that it is impossible to strip types from TypeScript without a grammar of TypeScript. Stripping types is not a token-level operation, and the TypeScript grammar is changing all the time. Consider for example: `foo( x )`. In TypeScript 1.5 this parsed as (foo (x)) because bar&baz wasn’t a valid type expression yet. When the type intersection operator was added, the parse changed to foo(x) which desugared to foo(x). I realise I’m going back in time here but it’s a nice simple example. If you want to continue to use new TypeScript features you are going to need to keep compiling to JS, or else keep your node version up to date. For people who like to stick on node LTS releases this may be an unacceptable compromise. reply madeofpalk 8 hours agoparentIt looks like the team has already considered this in one regard > There is already a precedent for something that Node.js support, that can be upgraded seperately, its NPM. Node bundles a version of npm that can upgraded separately, we could do the same with our TypeScript transpiler. > We could create a package that we bundle but that can also be downloaded from NPM, keep a stable version in core, but if TypeScript releases new features that we don't support or breaking changes, or users want to use the new shiny experimental feature, they can upgrade it separately. This ensures that users are not locked, but also provides support for a TypeScript version for the whole 3 years of the lifetime of Node.js release. https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/217 reply SomeCallMeTim 2 hours agorootparentAs long as Node understands to use the project-specific version of TypeScript (i.e., the one in node_modules or the PNP equivalent), that should be fine. But it would be a step backward to need to globally upgrade TypeScript (as you do with npm), since some older projects will not be compatible with newer versions of TypeScript. Ask me how I know. ;) reply silverwind 1 hour agorootparent> As long as Node understands to use the project-specific version of TypeScript It won't, but in such a scenario, typescript would only be a type checker, wich is a entirely different endeavor than running typescript. reply WorldMaker 3 hours agoparentprevThe syntax from the perspective of type stripping has been relatively stable for more versions of Typescript than it was unstable. You had to reach all the way back to 1.5 in part because it's been very stable since about 2.x. The last major shift in syntax was probably Conditional Types in 2.8 adding the ternary if operator in type positions. (The type model if you were to try to typecheck rather than just type-strip has changed a lot since 2.x, but syntax has been generally stable. That's where most of Typescript's innovation has been in the type model/type inferencing rather than in syntax.) It's still just (early in the process) Stage 1, but the majority of Typescript's type syntax, for the purposes of type stripping (not type checking), is attempting to be somewhat standardized: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations reply teaearlgraycold 2 hours agorootparentThey did just add a new keyword, satisfies, in 5.4. That would be a breaking change if you can’t upgrade the type stripper separately. reply felixfbecker 1 hour agorootparentThis is true, but in other cases they added keywords in ways that could work with type stripping. For example, the `as` keyword for casts has existed for a long time, and type stripping could strip everything after the `as` keyword with a minimal grammar. When TypeScript added const declarations, they added it as `as const` so a type stripping could have still worked depending on how loosely it is implemented. I think there is a world where type stripping exists (which the TS team has been in favor of) and the TS team might consider how it affects type stripping in future language design. For example, the `satisfies` keyword could have also been added by piggy-backing on the `as` keyword, like: const foo = { bar: 1 } as subtype of Foo (I think not using `as` is a better fit semantically but this could be a trade-off to make for better type stripping backwards compatibility) reply Timon3 6 minutes agorootparentI don't know a lot about parser theory, and would love to learn more about ways to make parsing resilient in cases like this one. Simple cases like \"ignore rest of line\" make sense to me, but I'm unsure about \"adversarial\" examples (in the sense that they are meant to beat simple heuristics). Would you mind explaining how e.g. your `as` stripping could work for one specific adversarial example? function foo() { return bar( null as unknown as T extends boolean ? true /* ): */ : (T extends string ? \"string\" : false ) ) } function bar(value: any): void {} Any solution I can come up with suffers from at least one of these issues: - \"ignore rest of line\" will either fail or lead to incorrect results - \"find matching parenthesis\" would have to parse comments inside types (probably doable, but could break with future TS additions) - \"try finding end of non-JS code\" will inevitably trip up in some situations, and can get very expensive I'd love a rough outline or links/pointers, if you can find the time!

Still. reply felixfbecker 1 hour agoparentprevI think the kind of teams that always stay on top of the latest TypeScript version and use the latest language features are also more likely to always stay on top of the latest Node versions. In my experience TypeScript upgrades actually more often need migrations/fixes for new errors than Node upgrades. Teams that don't care about latest V8 and Node features and always stay on LTS probably also care less about the latest and greatest TypeScript features. reply the_gipsy 11 hours agoparentprevYou would also have to update your compiler. I guess you could phrase this as: you can't update your TS versions independently from your node.js version. But that's probably not an issue. reply zarzavat 10 hours agorootparentIt’s an issue because node has a system of LTS releases, whereas TypeScript has quarterly updates, so the release cadence is different. Updating node is much more fraught than updating TypeScript. For example, it may break any native code modules. That’s why users are directed to use the LTS and not the most recent release, so that there’s enough time for libraries to add support for the new version. On the other hand, I usually adopt a new TypeScript version as soon as it comes out. reply satanacchio 9 hours agorootparentI made it sure to decouple the transpiler from node itself, the transpiler is in a npm package called amaro, that is bundled in node. The goal is to allow user to upgrade amaro indipendently so we dont have to lock a ts version for the whole lifespan of a release reply mort96 9 hours agorootparentprevTypeScript feels \"boring\" enough at this point that being a few years behind isn't gonna be an issue in most cases. For teams who want to stay on the absolute latest release of TypeScript but want to be more conservative with their Node version, external compilation will remain necessary; but for someone like me, where TypeScript has been \"good enough\" for many years that I'm not excited by new TypeScript releases, this feature will be really nice. (\"Boring\" in this context is a compliment, by the way) EDIT: Though reading other comments, it seems like you can update the typescript stripper independent of node? That makes this moot anyway reply mu53 8 hours agorootparenttypescript is still evolving in dramatic ways. The 5.0 release has some really good improvements reply mort96 6 hours agorootparentBut at the same time, it's good enough and has been good enough for many years. It's like how I'm sure EcmaScript 2024 contains cool new stuff, but if node only supported ES6, I would have no trouble writing ES6. reply another-dave 10 hours agorootparentprevThough I'd primarily see this as a feature for the REPL or manual scripts where I'm not going to mind doing a `nvm use X`. For production use, I'd still put my TS files through a build pipeline as normal reply chrisweekly 6 hours agorootparenttangential protip: if you're using nvm to manage node versions, take a look at fnm as a superior replacement. (It can read the same .nvmrc file to switch on cd into a given dir, but it's faster and \"cleaner\" wrt impact on your shell.) reply klodolph 5 hours agorootparentprevNot necessarily. With a couple exceptions (like enums), you can strip the types out of TypeScript and end up with valid JS. What you could do is stabilize the grammar, and release new versions of TypeScript using the same grammar. Maybe you need a flag to use LTS grammar in your tsconfig.json file. reply nialv7 5 hours agoparentprevUsing inequality signs as angled brackets really is a mistake isn't it... reply jmull 5 hours agorootparentMistake isn't the right word. It's just a tradeoff. There was no perfect solution available, so a tradeoff was necessary. You can disagree with this particular tradeoff, but had they gone another way some people would disagree with that as well. To be a mistake there would have had to have been an option available that was clearly better at the time. Anyway, the idea that TS 5 should be backwards compatible with TS 1 is probably a bad one. Personally, I think packages with wide usage break backwards compatibility far too easily -- it puts everyone who uses it on an upgrade treadmill, so it should be done very judiciously. But even I wouldn't argue that TS 1 should have been its final form. reply SomeCallMeTim 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a TypeScript mistake. You could argue that it was a C++ mistake. It makes parsing harder, but otherwise seems to work as expected, so I don't consider it a mistake, but you could at least argue that way. But regardless if it was a mistake in C++, it's now a complete standard, used in C++, Java, C#, and other languages to denote type parameters. I would argue that it would have been a mistake to break that standard. What would you have used, and in what way would that have been enough better to compensate for the increased difficulty in understanding TypeScript generics for users of almost every other popular language? reply vips7L 2 hours agorootparentIt's definitely the right choice for Typescript. You could have gone the Scala route and used [] for generics, but that is so heavily used in ts/js as arrays it would not have made any sense. reply klodolph 5 hours agorootparentprevI’ll flip this around… reusing comparison as angle brackets is the mistake. C++ ran into some issues too. I think Rust made the really smart move of putting :: before any type parameters for functions. Go made the good move of using square brackets for type parameters. reply zarzavat 5 hours agorootparentThe problem can be traced back to ASCII/typewriters only including three sets of paired characters, plus inequality signs, which is not enough for programming languages. We really need five sets: grouping, arrays/indexing, records, type parameters, and compound statements. Curly braces {} are also overloaded in JS for records and compound statements, leading to x => {} and x => ({}) meaning different things. Square brackets wouldn't work for parametric functions because f[T](x) already means get the element at index T and call it. reply parasense 1 hour agorootparentPaired characters... That's an interesting topic. Do you happen to know if UTF-8 contains more \"pair\" characters? In Latex we call these delimiteres, but that's just my limited experience coming in from math side. I tend to agree that it would be helpful to have more kind of nesting/pairing/grouping/delimiting characters. The problem is my imagination is limited to what I know from the ASCII world, and so it goes... no idea what new sets would look like. reply pshc 34 minutes agorootparentSo many different pairs are available. I like Asian corner brackets 「」and French guillemets « ». The angle brackets 〈〉 are popular in CS/math papers I think, though they might be confused with . reply xigoi 4 hours agorootparentprevI think the D syntax would work: f!T(x) reply behnamoh 4 hours agorootparentprevEverytime a standardization happens, part of human creativity gets suppressed. Before ASCII, people were inventing all sorts of symbols and even the alphabet was flexible to changes. After ASCII, we got stuck with a certain set of letters and symbols. Heck, even our keyboards haven't changed that much since then. I really think we need more symbols than just &@$#%^*}{][()/\\_~| reply lolinder 5 hours agorootparentprevI don't think you're flipping it around, I think that's exactly what OP was saying, just clearer. reply noname120 10 hours agoparentprevIt's already the case for ECMAScript and I don't see why TypeScript should be treated differently when Node.js has to transpile it to JavaScript and among other things ensure that there are no regressions that would break existing code. Unlike Python typing it's not only type erasure: enums, namespaces, decorators, access modifiers, helper functions and so on need to be transformed into their JavaScript equivalent. reply Tade0 10 hours agoparentprevI'm not worried about that too much to be honest. To me beyond v4.4 or so, when it started being possible to create crazy recursive dependent types (the syntax was there since ~4.1 - it's just that the compiler complained), there weren't a lot of groundbreaking new features being added, so unless an external library requires a specific TS version to parse its type declarations, it doesn't change much. reply 3np 8 hours agorootparent> crazy recursive dependent types Some edge-cases involving those have bugfixes and ergonomy improvents I've run into on 5.x. reply getcrunk 7 hours agoparentprevDo you really need to update all the time? Are the new features always that immediately important? reply spoiler 11 hours agoparentprevIt's possible that internal SWC version will be versioned alongside Node, meaning TS syntax support won't drift. Or am I missing something? reply satanacchio 2 hours agorootparentyes but can also be upgraded separately as npm package reply thecopy 10 hours agorootparentprevTypeScript evolves independent of Node, and the syntax you can use depends on your `typescript` version in the `package.json` reply re-thc 9 hours agorootparentNot if SWC or your tooling doesn't support it. reply unilynx 3 hours agoprevIf this feature ever becomes the default (ie not behind a flag) - how will the NPM ecosystem respond? Will contributors still bother to build CJS end EJS versions when publishing a NPM module, or just slap an 'engine: nodejs >= 25' on the package.json and stop bothering with the build step before pushing to NPM ? I personally would very much prefer if NPM modules that have their original code in TS and are currently transpiling would stop shipping dist/.cjs so I unambiguously know where to put my debugger/console.log statements. And it would probably be very tempting to NPM contributors to not have to bother with a build step anymore. But won't this start a ripple effect through NPM where everyone will start to assume very quickly 'everyone accepts TS files' - it only takes one of your dependencies for this effect to ripple through? It seems to me that nodejs can't move this outside an opt-in-experimental-flag without the whole community implicitly expecting all consumers to accept TS files before you know it. And if they do, it will be just months before Firefox and Safari will be force to accept it too, so all JS compilers will have to discard TS type annotations Which I would personally be happy with - we're building transcompiling steps into NPM modules that convert the ts code into js and d.ts just to support some hypothetical JS user even though we're using TS on the including side. But if node accepts .ts files we could just remove those transpiling steps without ever noticing it... so what's stopping NPM publishers from publishing js/d.ts files without noticing they broke anything? reply satanacchio 2 hours agoparentWe dont support running .ts files in node_modules, this is one of the main constraints to avoid breaking the ecosystem reply nfriedly 2 hours agoparentprevFor the old libraries I maintain that are typescript and transpiled into .cjs and .mjs for npm, I'll probably just start shipping all three versions. For a new thing I was writing from scratch, yeah, I might just ship typescript and not bother transpiling. [edit: Apparently not. TS is only for top-level things, not libraries in node_modules according to the sibling comment from satanacchio who I believe is the author of the PR that added TS support and a member of the Node.js Technical Steering Committee] reply WorldMaker 2 hours agorootparentWhy are you still transpiling to .cjs in 2024? ESM is supported in every LTS version of Node now. We can kill CJS, we have the power. reply nfriedly 1 hour agorootparentBecause I don't like breaking things unnecessarily. Some of my libraries are 10 years old and depended upon by similarly old projects that are not using ESM and probably never will. Besides, it's already going through one transpilation step to go from TS to ESM, so adding a second one for CJS really isn't that much hassle. I think if node.js had made require() work with ESM, I could probably drop CJS. But since that's probably never going to happen, I'm just going to continue shipping both versions for old projects and not worry about it. reply WorldMaker 20 minutes agorootparent> I think if node.js had made require() work with ESM, I could probably drop CJS Why is making downstream have to switch to `await import()` that big of a deal? You can use async/await in CJS just fine. Sure, sometimes you may need to resort to some ugly async IIFE wrappers because CJS doesn't support top-level await like ESM does, but is that really such a big deal? Sure, it's a breaking change, but that's what semver major bumps are for. I just think that if projects want to stay in CJS they should learn how to use async/await. I clearly don't understand why CJS libraries feel a need synchronous require() for everything. (Though to be fair, I've also never intentionally written anything directly in CJS. I learned enough in the AMD days to avoid CJS like a plague.) reply nfriedly 4 minutes agorootparent> Why is making downstream have to switch to `await import()` that big of a deal? > You can use async/await in CJS just fine. Sure, sometimes you may need to resort to some ugly async IIFE wrappers because CJS doesn't support top-level await like ESM does, but is that really such a big deal? It might seem like a small amount of work, but for a library you have to multiply that small amount of work by the number of users it will effect, which can become a quite large amount in aggregate. And, for what benefit? So I can drop one line from my CI config? It just seems like a huge waste of everyone's time. Also, as a library user, I would (and occasionally do) get annoyed by seemingly unnecessary work foisted on my by a library author.

Once it becomes un-flagged I might consider dropping CJS. reply pansa2 14 hours agoprevIf Node.js can run TypeScript files directly, then the TypeScript compiler won't need to strip types and convert to JavaScript - it could be used solely as a type checker. This would be similar to the situation in Python, where type checkers check types and leave them intact, and the Python interpreter just ignores them. It's interesting, though, that this approach in Python has led to several (4?) different popular type checkers, which AFAIK all use the same type hint syntax but apply different semantics. However for JavaScript, TypeScript seems to have become the one-and-only popular type checker. In Python, I've even heard of people writing types in source code but never checking them, essentially using type hints as a more convenient syntax for comments. Support for ignoring types in Node.js would make that approach possible in JavaScript as well. reply winter_blue 14 hours agoparentFlow (by Facebook) used to be fairly significant in the JavaScript several years ago, but right now it's somewhat clear that TypeScript has won rather handily. reply mattnewton 13 hours agorootparentBefore that there was the closure compiler (Google) which had type annotations in comments. The annotation syntax in comments was a little clunky but overall that project was ahead of it's time. Now I believe even inside google that has been transpiled to typescript (or typescript is being transpiled to closure, I can't remember which - the point is that the typescript interface is what people are using for new code). reply miki123211 13 hours agorootparentClosure was also interesting because it integrated type checking and minification, which made minification significantly more useful. With normal Javascript and typescript, you can't minify property names, so `foo.bar.doSomethingVeryComplicated()` can only be turned into `a.bar.doSomethingVeryComplicated()`, not `a.b.c()`, like with Closure. This is because objects can be indexed by strings. Something like `foo.bar[function]()` is perfectly valid JS, where the value of `function` might come from the user. A minifier can't guarantee that such expressions won't be used, so it cannot optimize property accesses. Because Closure was a type checker and a minifier at the same time, it could minify the properties declared as private, while leaving the public ones intact. reply kevincox 4 hours agorootparent> it could minify the properties declared as private, while leaving the public ones intact. I don't think it ever actually did this. It renamed all properties (you could use the index syntax to avoid this) and just used a global mapping to ensure that every source property name was consistently renamed (no matter what type it was on). I don't think type information was ever actually used in minification. So if you had two independent types that had a `getName` function the compiler would always give them the same minified name even though in theory their names could be different because they were fully independent types. The mapping was always bijective. This is suboptimal because short names like `a` could only be used for a single source name, leading to higher entropy names overall. Additionally names from the JS runtime were globally excluded from renaming. So any `.length` property would never be renamed in case it was `[].length`. reply mananaysiempre 7 hours agorootparentprev> A minifier can't guarantee that such expressions won't be used, so it cannot optimize property accesses. Given TypeScript’s type system is unsound, neither could it even if it tried, right? I guess Flow could, but well, here we are. reply afavour 7 hours agorootparentTheoretically TS could… until it encounters an ‘any’ type in that code path, then it would have to give up. But there are TSconfig options to ensure no use of any so with the right level of strictness it could happen. reply epolanski 6 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by unsound exactly. I'm asking because there's no accepted definition of what an unsound type system is. What I often see is that the word unsound is used to mean that a type system can accept types different to what has been declared, and in that case there's nothing unsound about ts since it won't allow you to do so. reply cstrahan 4 hours agorootparent> and in that case there's nothing unsound about ts since it won't allow you to do so Consider this example (https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=10&ssc=1&pln=1&pc=1...): function messUpTheArray(arr: Array): void { arr.push(3); } const strings: Array = ['foo', 'bar']; messUpTheArray(strings); const s: string = strings[2]; console.log(s.toLowerCase()) Could you explain how this isn't the type system accepting types \"different to what has been declared\"? Kinda looks like TypeScript is happy to type check this, despite `s` being a `number` at runtime. reply epolanski 2 hours agorootparentThat's a good example, albeit quite of a far-fetched one. In Haskell land, where the type system is considered sound you have `head` functions of type `List a -> a` that are unsound too, because the list might be empty. reply crdrost 54 minutes agorootparentThat option also exists, you can just leave out the `messUpTheArray` lines and you get an error about how `undefined` also doesn't have a `.toLowerCase()` method. However this problem as stated is slightly different and has to do with a failure of OOP/subtyping to actually intermingle with our expectations of covariance. So to just use classic \"animal metaphor\" OOP, if you have an Animal class with Dog and Cat subclasses, and you create an IORef, a cell that can contain a cat, you would like to provide that to an IORef function because you want to think of the type as covariant: Cat is a subtype of Animal, F should be a subtype of F. The problem is that this function now has the blessing of the type system to store a Dog in the cell, which can be observed by the parts that still consider this an IORef. Put slightly differently, in OOP, the methods of IORef all accept an implicit IORef called `this`, if those methods are part of what define an IORef then an IORef is necessarily invariant, not covariant, in . And then you can't assume subtyping. So to be sound a subtype system would presumably have to actually mark contra/covariance around everything, and TypeScript very intentionally documents that they don't do this and are just trying to make a \"best effort\" pass because JavaScript has 0 types, and crappy types are better than no types, and we can't wait for perfect types to replace the crappy types. reply sharlos201068 4 hours agorootparentprevThat’s not correct, there’s several ways the actual type of a value differs from what typescript thinks it is. But soundness isn’t a goal of typescript. reply WorldMaker 3 hours agorootparentIt's maybe useful to note in this discussion for some that \"soundness\" of a type system is a bit of technical/theoretical jargon that in some cases has specific mathematical definitions and so \"unsound\" often sounds harsher (connotatively) than it means. The vast majority of type systems are \"unsound\" for very pragmatic reasons. Developers don't often care to work in a \"sound\" type systems. Some of the \"most sound\" type systems we've collectively managed to build are in things like theorem provers and type assertion systems that some of us don't always even consider useful for \"real\" software development. Typescript is a bit more unsound than most because of the escape hatch `any` and because of the (intentional) disconnect between compiler and runtime environment. Even though \"unsound\" sounds like a bad thing to be, it's a big part of why Typescript is so successful. reply mananaysiempre 2 hours agorootparentprev> there's no accepted definition of what an unsound type system is Huh? The cheeky answer would be that the definition here is the one the TypeScript documentation itself uses[1]. The useful answer is that there’s only one general definition that I’ve ever encountered: a type system is sound if no well-typed program encounters type errors during its execution. Importantly, that’s not a statement about the (static) type system in isolation: it’s tied to the language’s dynamic semantics. The tricky part, of course, is defining “type error”. In theoretical contexts, it’s common to just not define any evaluation rules at all for outwardly ill-typed things (negating a list, say), thus the common phrasing that no well-typed program must get stuck (unable to evaluate further). In practical statically-typed languages, there are on occasion cases that are defined not to be type errors essentially by fiat, such as null pointer accesses in Java, or escape hatches, such as unsafeCoerce in practical implementations of Haskell. Of course, ECMAScript just defines behaviour for everything (except violating invariants in proxy handlers, in which case, lol, good luck), so arguably every static type system for it is sound, even one that allows var foo: string = 42. Obviously that’s not a helpful point of view. I think it’s reasonable to say that whatever we count as erroneous situations must at the very least include all occurrences of ReferenceError and TypeError. TypeScript prevents most of them, which is good enough for its linting use case, when the worst possible result is that a buggy program crashes. It would definitely not be good enough for Closure Compiler’s minification use case, when the worst possible result is that a correct program gets silently miscompiled (misminified?).

Fwiw I’ve been working with TypeScript for 8+ years now and I’m pretty sure wrong type hints has never been a problem. TS is a God-send for working with a codebase. reply cstrahan 3 hours agorootparentNo, TypeScript is not unsound because it uses structural typing. A language has a sound type system if every well-typed program behaves as defined by the language's semantics during execution. Go is structurally typed, and yet it is sound: code that successfully type checks is guaranteed to abide the semantics of the language. TypeScript is unsound because code that type checks does not necessarily abide the semantics of the language: function messUpTheArray(arr: Array): void { arr.push(3); } const strings: Array = ['foo', 'bar']; messUpTheArray(strings); const s: string = strings[2]; console.log(s.toLowerCase()) `strings` is declared as a `Array`, but TypeScript is happy to insert a `number` into it. This is a contradiction, and an example of unsoundness. `s` is declared as `string`, but TypeScript is happy to assign a `number` to it. This is a contradiction, and an example of unsoundness. This code eventually fails at runtime when we try to call `s.toLowerCase()`, as `number` has no such function. What we're seeing here is that TypeScript will readily accept programs which violate its own rules. Any language that does this, whether nominally typed or structurally typed, is unsound. reply nyssos 5 hours agorootparentprevThere's not much connection.

The only time an issue ever came up for me was in dealing with arrays let foo: number[] = [0, 1, 2] // typed as number but it’s really undefined let bar = foo[3] But once you’re aware of the caveat it’s something you can deal with, and it certainly doesn’t negate the many massive benefits that TS confers over vanilla JS. reply lolinder 2 hours agorootparentYeah, that example is unsound in the same way that Java's type system is unsound, it's a compromise nearly all languages make to avoid forcing you to add checks when you know what you're doing.

There are a few edge cases that I'm aware of, but they don't really come up in practice. reply jaggederest 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah I start projects by explicitly typing `any` all over the place and gradually refining things, so every type that's specified is explicit and checked, I'm really enjoying that style. reply crabmusket 13 hours agorootparentCombine this with an eslint config that nudges you about explicit any, and the typescript compiler option to disallow implicit any, and you're well taken care of. reply pansa2 13 hours agorootparentprevWith this approach, do you still use Python's standard syntax for type hints? def mersenne(p: int): return 2**p - 1 Or, given there's no need for the type hints to be checker-friendly, do you make them more human-friendly, e.g: def mersenne(p: 'prime number'): return 2**p - 1 reply Humphrey 13 hours agorootparentprevExactly. And if you use a library that does lots of meta programming (like Django) then it's impossible to pass all type errors. Hopefully one day the type system will be powerful enough to write a Django project with passing tests. reply edflsafoiewq 6 hours agorootparentprevIME if you aren't checking them, they're eventually going to be out of date. reply BiteCode_dev 9 hours agoprevEventually, node might allow JS to introspect those types. That would be a huge win. Right now in Python, great tools like pydantic exist because Python can introspect said types, and generate checks out of them. This mean you can define simple types, and get: - type checking - run time data check - api generation - api document generation Out of a single, standard notation. Right now in JS, things like zod have to do: const mySchema = z.string(); Which is basically reinventing what typescript is already doing. reply bythreads 9 hours agoparentThat's not entirely true. `z.string()` in Zod offers more than just type safety akin to TypeScript. TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, while Zod adds runtime validation and parsing. For those unfamiliar: `z.string()` effectively converts `mySchema` into a functional schema capable of parsing and validation. For example: `mySchema.parse(\"some data\")` returns successfully. `mySchema.parse(321)` throws an exception. I've used it in places where you need runtime validation and in process verification - it works pretty well for that and you can extract the types from it via : const A = z.string(); type A = z.infer; // string Meaning if you define your types in zod first, and infer their types from that you get compile and runtime type checking. --- It a bit of an overkill for nimble and fast code bases though - but works wonders for situations where in process proofing needs to be done, and in all honesty it isn't that big of a task to do this. reply Dylan16807 7 hours agorootparent> Zod offers more than just type safety akin to TypeScript. TypeScript provides compile-time type checking, while Zod adds runtime validation and parsing. Well of course it offers more, or you wouldn't be installing a library. The problem is that even when you're expressing normal Typescript types, you have to use entirely different syntax. It's good that you can usually avoid double-definition, but it's still a big barrier that shouldn't be necessary. reply tommy_axle 6 hours agorootparentprevThere's also typescript-to-zod that makes it possible to generate the zod schemas from your types. reply MrBazlow 8 hours agoparentprevA lot of the focus by the TypeScript team is focused on alignment with the JavaScript language these days and novel new features such as run time types have all but been dismissed or at the very least pushed behind the TC39 JavaScript types proposal. Much like using decorators on variables outside of class structures was. Having said that, TypeScript allows plugins, these are very rarely used as they augment the language by introducing other features that are transformed into the resulting JavaScript files. One plugin that relates to your suggestion of run time types is called Typia, it permits you to use your TypeScript type signatures at runtime with guards like `assert(myValue)` where it intercepts the function call to construct an exhaustive if statement in the transpiled JavaScript checking the nature of the passed variable. So while I don't see it being a part of the language in the next four to six years, there are at least libraries out there already that allow you to do it today. reply hajile 4 hours agoparentprevIf JS ever adds type checking, I hope it doesn't choose Typescript. We need a type system that is actually sound and TS is intentionally unsound. We need a type system that doesn't allow bad coding practices like TS does. We need a type system that enforces program design that allows programs to be fast. We need a Hindley Milner type system. If you want a module to be typed, add a `\"use type\"`. This should disallow bad parts of the language like type coercion. It should disallow things that hurt performance like changing object shape/value type or making arrays of random collections of stuff. Incoming data from untyped modules would either coerce or throw errors if coercion can't be done at which point the compiler can deeply-optimize the typed code because it would have far stronger type guarantees and wouldn't have a risk of bailing out. reply ahuth 3 hours agorootparentWhat bad coding practices does TS allow, and why are they bad? reply DexesTTP 1 hour agorootparentTS allows you to pass a read-only object to a method taking a read-write value: type A = { value: number; } function test(a: A) { a.value = 3; } function main() { const a: Readonly = { value: 1 }; // a.value = 2;Does TS keep your object shape from changing so it will get optimized by the JIT? it actively does the opposite giving TONS of tools that allow you to add, remove, modify, and otherwise mess up your objects and guarantee your code will never optimize beyond the basic bytecode (making it one or two orders of magnitude more slow than it could otherwise be). Can you elaborate or point to some of the tools? So I know what tools I may need to avoid reply aitchnyu 9 hours agoparentprevDoes this mean Node can know if an exception is subclass of ValueError or an object is instance of SomeClass? I'm a TS newb, I thought types outside of array, object, number, string arent present in JS and Zod and typeguard functions return plain objects with \"trust me bro\". reply gampleman 9 hours agorootparentIn JS, classes do retain runtime information. So the `instanceof` is a real runtime operator that works by checking the prototype chain of an object. So checking subclasses can be done at runtime. However, in TS other type information is erased at compile time. So if you write type Foo = \"a\"\"b\"; the runtime code will see that just as a plain string. reply LelouBil 9 hours agorootparentprevYou are right, they aren't. In the JavaScript languages which is what gets actually executed, there are no typescript types. The parent commenter was talking about a way for nodejs to provide, via an API, the content of type annotations on fields/functions/variables like in python. However, in python the type annotations are a property of the object at run time, whereas they are completely stripped before execution for typescript. So I'm not sure how it would work except by changing the typescript philosophy of \"not changing runtime execution\" reply samtheprogram 14 hours agoprevBun’s DX is pretty unprecedented in this space, and most of my use cases are now covered / not causing Bun to crash (when actually using run-scripts with `bun run`). Meanwhile, I can’t configure node to not require extensions on import, nor have tsc configured to automatically add .js extensions to its compiled output, without adding on a bundler… although native TypeScript support would remedy this nit quite a bit, I can’t imagine the user experience (or performance) to match Bun’s when it reaches stable. reply spankalee 14 hours agoparentExtensions should be required.

And node has access to the filesystem, so it can do path searches just fine if it wants to support existing code. reply WorldMaker 3 hours agorootparentYou probably don't need a bundler in the browser anymore. We're not yet to the point that is a popular \"mainstream\" opinion, but between massive improvements in browser connection handling (HTTP 1.1 connection sharing actually works in more places, HTTP/2+) and very good ESM support in browser's well optimized preloaders and caching engines (which can sometimes reduce download size much better than all-or-none bundles can, sure the trade-off is network requests but we are in a good place to take that trade-off), we're at an exciting point where there is almost never a need to bundle in development environments, and it is increasingly an option to not bundle in production either. It is worth benchmarking today (I can't tell you what your profiler tools will tell you) if you are really gaining as much from production bundles as you think you are. Not enough people are running those benchmarks, but some of them may already be surprised. The Developer Experience of unbundled ESM is great. Of course you do need to do things like always use file extensions. But those aren't hard changes to make, worth it for the better Developer Experience, and if it can help us start to wean off of mega-bundler tools as required production compile time steps. reply samtheprogram 13 hours agorootparentprevThat makes sense. I guess since using .js for the relevant imports just works in TypeScript I should be happy then… reply silverwind 9 hours agorootparentprevYeah, besides that, leaving out the extension also creates ambiguity when the same filename exists with multiple file extensions. reply WuxiFingerHold 8 hours agoparentprevI like Bun a lot, but Deno is (still) the more mature, stable, capable (e.g. stable workers, http2) and depending on the use-case more performant option (V8 > JSC).

And surprisingly even though rust is on a different end of the language spectrum but yet it offers a similar feel. Edit: JIT was not the right terminology to use. I lazily wrote JIT. Apologies.

For scaling out rather than up, node and python are both far more performant because the footprint of minimum viable environment is much smaller.

As an example, when my org needs to contact folks about potential mass shooter events, our SLA is 90 seconds. If we did it in cloud with java or .net, it'd be too slow to spin up.

And nimbleness of the experience according to me plays a decent role. Currently for me, either I really care about performance and I default to rust for those applications or I need solutions where the product will evolve quickly over time and I need great DX over performance and I default to typescript for those.

But they could be even better by having first-class support for templating the module version into the URL so that the version can be stored separately, alongside the module name. Popular hosts with well-known URL structures could have their URLs automatically templated so you only have to specify the host and not the rest of the URL. In other words, the tooling could be better, but the fundamentals of URL imports are sound, IMO. reply zzo38computer 2 hours agorootparentI disagree. It should not default to \"https://\" (I think defaulting to local files would be better). Furthermore, I think that it should be made so that the \"hashed:\" scheme that I had invented (in the Scorpion protocol/file-format specification document, although this scheme can be used independently of that) can also be usable. And, popular hosts with well-known URL structures automatically templating also I would disagree, although it might do to allow any expressions in place of the string literals and then add functions for abbreviations of some of those URLs, if that would help (although I still think it is unnecessary). reply niklasmtj 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are also the `npm:`, `node:` and `jsr:` specifiers now.

Elle Griffin Jul 24, 2024 103 Share this post Every company should be owned by its employees www.elysian.press Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 67 Share There are 47 millionaires working for Central States Manufacturing, and they’re not all in the C-Suite. Many of them are drivers or machinists—blue-collar workers for the company. How? The company is owned by its employees. Every worker gets a salary but also a percentage of their salary in stock ownership. When the company does well, so do the employees—all of them, not just the ones at the top. And the company is doing well. “When we sat down eight years ago, we said we want to be a billion-dollar company and have 1,500 people, we are on track to be both of those this year,” Tim Ruger, president of Central States, tells me. That’s right, this manufacturing company will become a unicorn this year—one of only 6,000 companies in the world earning more than $1 billion in revenue. But unlike Walmart, Amazon, and Apple, it’s not just the executives getting paid out. “It’s not like 80 percent of the company is owned by management and the rest is owned by employees, it’s really well spread across all functions,” Ruger tells me. “We've got a number of people that have been here 15, 20 years and they have $1 million plus balances, which is really cool for a person that came out of high school and runs our rollformer. You can’t do that everywhere.” The Elysian is independent journalism focused on a better future. Thank you for supporting my work. Subscribe He’s right, and because you can’t do that everywhere there is a huge wealth disparity in America. Even though the economy has been on an upward trajectory for a century, the wealth it generates has funneled to a much smaller population who owns it. After a 1990s bill meant executives started getting paid in stock options while the rest of their employees earned a static salary, executive pay skyrocketed with the market while their workers’ pay stagnated. If employees had also owned part of the company, their pay would have skyrocketed with the market too, but they didn’t. “It's hard to build true wealth for yourself if you don't have some type of ownership in something, and it's hard for most people to get ownership in something,” Ruger says. Upping the minimum wage won’t fix that. As Nathan Schneider says in his book Everything for Everyone: “One way or another, wealth is going to the owners—of where we live, where we work, and what we consume.” So why not make workers the owners? There is a growing movement to do just that. Central States is one of 6,533 companies that have formed an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (or ESOP) in the United States, and that number is growing by about 250 companies annually. That’s 14.7 million employees who have ownership in companies worth, collectively, $2.1 trillion. Every year, those employees get a percentage of their salaries in company stock. During Central States’ worst year, employees earned the equivalent of 6 percent of their pay in stock, during their best they earned 26 percent. Last year, an employee earning $100,000 a year received $26,000 worth of stock in their account. As the company has grown, the value of that stock has averaged 20 percent returns annually, outperforming the stock market. Just like Jeff Bezos can sell a portion of his Amazon stock to buy a new house, employees at ESOPs can pull money out of their stock accounts to pay for tuition, medical bills, or as a downpayment on a primary residence. “We have several in production and drivers who have been here for over 20 years that have multi-million dollar accounts,” Chad Ware, Central States’ CFO tells me. “We’ve had several folks take out enough money to buy a home outright.” An ESOP account functions a lot like a second 401k, but invested solely in the company. Employees can pull out whenever they’d like, but outside of those approved uses they will have to pay taxes and an early withdrawal fee to remove the funds before the age of 59 ½. After they leave the company or retire, the complete balance of their accounts will be paid out to them over a six-year period. This means the company needs to have that cash on hand to pay out, and this has to be budgeted into their annual cash flow. But it also means the employees are incentivized to participate in the wellbeing of the company. On the stock market, executives are expected to produce quarterly results, often to the detriment of their companies’ long-term success. After Boeing famously rushed the rollout of its 737 MAX aircraft to meet quarterly expectations, fatal crashes and safety concerns killed 346 people and cost the company $20 billion. Companies like Wells Fargo, Sears, and Bausch Health have similarly cut corners to inflate short-term results at the expense of their long-term health. But an employee at Central States doesn’t care about one good quarter, they care about a good 10 years, and a good 50. If the company’s products turn out to be inferior next year their stock in the company will tank, if the company goes bankrupt in 20 years it will go down to zero. It’s in their best interest to act in the long-term interest of the company, and to grow it sustainably rather than quickly. “One of our CEOs likes to say that these companies are not looking to hit home runs, they're looking to hit singles and doubles on a regular basis,” Noelle Montaño, executive director for Employee-owned S Corporations of America (or ESCA) tells me. “When the C-Suite goes into work every day, they see the receptionist, the person on the factory floor, the guy who's building the building or digging the ditches, and they know that those are the shareholders they are responsible for. They take that seriously.” Every month, Central States executives share the company’s P&L with employees, and every year they share the financials of the business at annual shareholders meetings, where employee-owners can participate in discussions about the future of the company. After a new plant was struggling with sales in its second year, one employee-owner raised his hand at a shareholder meeting and said, “This isn’t helping our company, and it’s not helping my share price, can we discuss the closure of this plant?” “It was a great conversation, I love the fact that it’s not somebody else's problem,” Ruger says. “They're thinking like business owners, which is what you want, right?” As a result, ESOPs are generally healthier companies. “These companies do better at employee retention, they do better at retirement benefits, they default less often on loans,” Montaño says. “Our companies did better during the Great Recession, they did better during Covid.” There are serious benefits to the company for operating this way. ESOPs are a viable alternative to unions—there is no rift between the owners and the workers, workers are the owners! They are also exempt from paying income tax—though they tend to spend those dollars on their employees instead. “It helped us grow when we were smaller. Now that we're larger, what we're paying out each year to our employee-owners is probably more than we would pay in tax, quite honestly,” Ruger says. “But if I have to choose who we pay our money to, I'd rather pay employee owners than give it back to the government. I think it's probably the right way.” He brings up a good point. I’ve mentioned before that I do not think the answer to our wealth disparity is to “tax the rich.” Don’t take Jeff Bezos’ money and give it to the government, better distribute Amazon’s earnings among its employees—not just to its founder. “I think our taxes are way too burdening and we don’t do a good job using the money. I wouldn’t mind paying more if we were using it well, I just don’t know if we are,” Ruger says. “Why redistribute the wealth after it’s already been earned, why can’t we earn it beforehand? It naturally levels out the haves and have-nots.” It’s worth noting that the “haves” still benefit from this equation. “Most ESOP companies start because the founder wants to exit or cash out, but they don't want to sell to a private equity firm that will run their company into the ground or slash and burn employee headcount,” Ware says. “A lot of owners built a company and were in the trenches with the people beside them. They want to take care of them, but they also want to cash out. A good option is to set up an ESOP, and that's exactly how Central States got started.” Carl Carpenter founded Central States in 1988, but sold it to his employees when he retired in 1991. More specifically: He sold a portion of the shares of his company to an ESOP trust, which holds the company's shares on behalf of the employees. In 2011, the company bought the remaining shares and became 100% employee-owned. Carpenter sailed into the sunset with a nice retirement package even as he allowed his employees to start building their own, and I don’t see why every founder shouldn’t do the same. “There are real benefits for an owner turning the company into an ESOP,” Ruger says. “They personally benefit from the sale when they exit the business. Additionally, there are some real tax benefits to turn it into an ESOP—they pay a whole lot less taxes when they sell the company.” The only reason they don’t do it more often is because they don’t know about it. “The number one issue is education,” Montaño says. “If you're looking to sell your business and you go to your accountant or lawyer, they may not say ‘Have you thought about an ESOP?’” It’s also not a quick process—founders interested in selling to their employees need to plan ahead. A feasibility study needs to be conducted to ensure the viability of an ESOP plan and an independent valuation of the company needs to be conducted to determine the fair market value of the shares. A trust needs to be defined and structured, and a trustee appointed to oversee it on behalf of the employees. “If an owner just wants to get out, an ESOP is not for them,” Montaño says. That might be changing, ESOPs have bi-partisan support in Congress and moves have been made to improve education about ESOPS and make the transition easier for founders. “We have support from Members of Congress across the political spectrum.... It's capitalism at its best,” Montaño says. “A year and a half ago, there was legislation mandating the Department of Labor to open an Office of Employee Ownership, and they've taken a more robust interest in ESOP companies and recently appointed someone from the employee ownership community to this important role.” In 2022, only 34 percent of families in the bottom half of income distribution held stocks, while 78 percent of families in the upper-middle-income group did—95 percent of families in the top one percent held stocks. But employee ownership changes that equation. As the process becomes easier and education about ESOPs grows, more and more founders will exit by selling their companies to their employees, and the result is that more and more of the wealth will be owned by everyone who works, not just the person they work for. As the stock market gets richer, so will we all, and that’s a future I’m excited about working toward. “I'd love to see it more and more and more,” Ruger says. “It's really generating wealth for people, I’m convinced we're going to change generations.” Leave a comment This is a continuation of my capitalism series which is figuring out how capitalism can work better for everyone while serving as research for my utopian novel.

How would a business like this get started? Usually the owner is the one who invests a lot of their own time and/or money into the business to get it off the ground in the first place. Would we be asking workers to pony up in those early years when failure is likely? With Central States, the story picks up AFTER all that, when the business is already large and successful, and the owner just wants to retire. And what happens when the business struggles or fails later? In the case of Central States, the workers were asked to buy shares from the owner, probably using a portion of the salary they'd otherwise get. IOW, they're being underpaid relative to market, in exchange for ownership, expecting to get more later when they sell the shares. So far so good, but how does this look when the business has a rough patch, even one that's not their fault? reply nostrademons 2 hours agoparentThe article is arguing for ESOPs, basically stock options for employees. The examples cited are actually quite tame by tech industry standards: \"During Central States’ worst year, employees earned the equivalent of 6 percent of their pay in stock, during their best they earned 26 percent.\" By contrast, FANG employees routinely make >50% of their compensation in stock, and it can be up to 80% in good years. As for how these get started, it's the same as any tech startup. The founding team owns the whole company at formation, and then they progressively give it away to increase the overall valuation of the company. You can do that through giving away stock in exchange for funding from a VC that you can use to pay employees, or you can give away stock directly in exchange for services rendered. And yes, this looks bad during a down year. Tech companies have this problem all the time - employees are demotivated when the stock price goes down, which can have further negative effects on the stock price. reply jasode 1 hour agorootparent>As for how these get started, it's the same as any tech startup. [...] To clarify, the gp was asking a rhetorical question that he already knew the answer to when he stated, \"How would a business [that already looks attractive for ESOP] like this get started? [... his recap similar to your recap ...]\" To put it differently, the scenario he's trying to explain is something like this given that ~9 out 10 businesses fail : - you can't look at just a single company's successful timeline to judge the ESOP for society; you also have to consider all the failed companies and how ESOPs would play out in those timelines as well. Since ~90% of businesses fail, you have to play out the financial dynamics of employees buying into ownership of all those failed companies. And in contradiction of employee-ownership, a lot of employees would prefer getting a bigger paycheck from a dying company rather than having money deducted to buy worthless equity shares. - e.g. of course employees would love to be significant workers-cooperative owners of Amazon Inc and Apple Inc. But the analysis also must include employees owning worthless shares of Pets.com (bankrupt 2000 and shutdown) and Commodore Computer (bankrupt 1994). Some workers got employee-ownership shares of Commodore Inc instead of Apple Inc?!? Well, it sucks to be those workers. reply victorbjorklund 1 hour agorootparentprevGetting some of your salary in stock options isn't really an employee owned company. How many % of total Google shares are owned by employees (excluding the founding employees)? 0,0000000001%? At least 50% would be required for it to be viewed as an employee owned company. reply jonas21 1 minute agorootparentGoogle paid out over $22 billion in stock-based compensation in 2023. You can read this in their public earnings reports. That's over 1% of the value of the company transferred to employees in one year. Now most people probably sell that stock as soon as they can, but it would be hostile to employees to prevent them from selling in an effort to make it an \"employee-owned company\". reply nostrademons 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't know about Google specifically, but I know that it's way more than 0.0000000001% because I personally have been paid more than 0.0001% of Google in stock compensation. A typical Series A startup reserves 20% of the company for the option pool, and then there are follow-on refresh grants. Note that if you run the math on the company in the article, they're considerably less generous than that. They say they have 1500 employees, $1B in revenue, and the average employee makes about 8-26% of their earnings. Figure that's maybe $20K/employee * 1500 employees = $30M in stock compensation on $1B in revenue, so they spend 3% of their revenue on stock compensation. If you figure the company is valued at $4B, they're giving away like 0.75% of the company per year, a bit less than Google and way less than a tech startup. This is probably a PR hit for Central States Manufacturing anyway, to help their recruitment efforts. reply stagger87 29 minutes agorootparentprevIn an ESOP, employees typically own 100% of the stock. reply overrun11 58 minutes agorootparentprevThere's no reason why this is beneficial. Money and stocks are fungible you can freely exchange one for the other as much as your heart desires. There's no difference between which one you receive. reply nostrademons 46 minutes agorootparentMoney and stocks would be fungible if all companies were public, all investors had perfect information, and no employee could make a difference in the stock price of their employer. All three of those conditions are false. You may be working for a private company that you would not otherwise be able to buy the stock of; sometimes, employment is the only way to get ownership of it. You often have better information about how your own employer is doing than you do about random public companies. And for smaller companies, you can often make a difference in the company's bottom line. This is why companies offer stock compensation in the first place, as an incentive for you to have a stake in the company's success. If your company is a shithole or fraud, then you absolutely do not want to be receiving company stock. But then, if that's the case you may want to re-evaluate working for it at all. reply bognition 41 minutes agorootparentprevLet's ignore that most of the places people work are not publicly traded companies and pretend that any employee could buy stock in their employer. If that were the case and employees were compensated equally in stock vs cash, then yes there is no _rational_ difference. However, most human are not rational. People like to take pride in their work and do a great job, this is amplified when they stand to directly benefit from their efforts. By enabling employees ownership in a company you're hoping to incentivize them to work harder and therefore amplify the return on their labor. reply overrun11 26 minutes agorootparentThe private company case is worse because now it's completely illiquid. This all strikes me as a rich person's idea of what poor people want. Someone making $15/hour wants the $15 not $10 + equity in a private company worth $5 which they cannot sell but gives them 1/1000 voting rights and maybe sometimes a 7 cent a quarter dividend subject to board approval and market whims. Most workers are not sophisticated investors and I'd rather they put excess savings into broadly diversified index funds instead of low quality equity in whatever small business they happen to be working at. reply bumby 37 minutes agorootparentprev>If that were the case and employees were compensated equally in stock vs cash, then yes there is no _rational_ difference. Even if this assumes an equal net present value, wouldn't the volatility of stock vs. cash make a very rational difference in expected future value? For people who are risk adverse, the cash would probably be preferred; for those who are less risk adverse, the opposite is probably true. reply stagger87 26 minutes agorootparentprevIn an ESOP, stocks are not normally fungible and cannot be traded easily. Usually they are bought back post employment. In my case I was able to either get cash or have it put into a 401k. reply RhodesianHunter 53 minutes agorootparentprevYou seem to have missed an absolutely critical element of what drives human behavior. We call it \"incentive\". reply overrun11 46 minutes agorootparentYes both the money and the stock are incentives and they are of equal value. You've still failed to explain why one is better than the other. reply yibg 2 minutes agoparentprevThis model also puts a lot of risk on the employees. It’s basically forcing investment in the same company that pays your salary. An investment that has less liquidity than standard investments. It’s like putting all your retirement fund into your company’s stock. reply RandomCitizen12 2 hours agoparentprev> How would a business like this get started?

Would we be asking workers to pony up in those early years when failure is likely? In Canada, there are 'Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations' with union overseers to do this and special tax deductions for investing money through these. They are, of course, a giant failure that neither provides easier access to capital for entrepreneurs nor generates any notable return for investors. reply harhargange 1 hour agorootparentMoreover, splitting the decision making is so conflict prone and unoptimised for competition. I had a look at some statistics that showed most successful startups take off when they have a single founder reply esarbe 41 minutes agorootparentThis is about ownership, not decision making. How you set up the decision making process is entirely up to the company. The same argument could be made for any other kind of shared ownership company. reply zozbot234 48 minutes agoparentprev> How would a business like this get started? Every business gets started as \"100% owned by its founders\" with no other people involved. The interesting question is why founders might want to (1) cede some equity stake in the business, or (2) hire outside people for fixed wages, as opposed to a share in the business itself. The dirty little secret is that people hate to put all of their eggs in one basket, so working in exchange for an equity stake is actually a pretty bad deal in both cases. Both fixed wages and the selling of equity stakes (as an alternative to issuing debt) are, at their most basic level, mechanisms for dealing with risk and uncertainty. In practice, a partnership-like corporate structure works well for business that have low capital intensity, which doesn't describe most startups but might be quite true of some service-provision businesses, even in the \"tech\" sector. reply hemantv 3 hours agoparentprevIndividuals have visions not committee. We build monuments for individuals not for committee. Having said that no man is island of itself. Current incentive structure works great to motivate individuals to start companies reply Draiken 58 minutes agorootparentI don't think this holds to scrutiny. This breaks down as soon as you get out of the idea phase. Everyone has visions, and most great achievements today are the results of an amalgamation of them. The really big achievements are almost always the result of groups, not individuals. People that idolize others have to turn a blind eye to everything surrounding that individual's achievement. It's simply easier to simplify big achievements as \"this person was great\". In reality though, it's a culmination of everything that came before that individual, the support around them, some of their decisions and much more. In other words: monuments are a bad argument to evaluate if something is good or not. Especially in today's individualistic society. It's a shallow Instagram motivational phrase. reply Apocryphon 2 hours agorootparentprevSeems like confirmation bias. We often than not like to lionize successful individuals, but plenty of visions are false or otherwise fail. On the other hand, we tend not to remember group efforts because it's harder to remember multiple individuals at a time. But surely they do exist. Was there a single visionary behind Bell Labs? Xerox PARC? The traitorous eight? The Apollo program? The Manhattan Project? reply harhargange 1 hour agorootparentI believe there would be a single polymath who has skills in multiple fields, such as Oppenheimer who was great at science and administration who can lead a group for successful execution. For Apollo moon mission, it was the US president vision at the foremost. Even for TSMC and other companies such people exist. I don't want to say that entire credit goes to an individual but leaders with multiple skills are necessary. reply pineaux 42 minutes agorootparentNah, this is not true. This is just the narrative because someone want to get the honors or the stacks of cash. Apple wasn't created by Steve Jobs. Not even created by Steve Jobs and the Woz. They did start something that eventually became Apple. They had a lot of sway, but without all the other people that worked there and created all the important details it would have just been a pipe dream. reply nsonha 2 hours agorootparentprevGroups are slower and less consistent in decision making than individuals, simple as that. reply Apocryphon 2 hours agorootparentThere are different types of group governance and almost all of them having an individual decision-maker at the front. Oppenheimer directed the Manhattan Project but he wasn't a \"visionary individual,\" he had plenty of talented geniuses working under him. reply sidmitra 2 hours agorootparentprev>We build monuments for individuals not for committee.

If the story is \"every company should offer stock options to its employees\", then sure, that's often a good business plan. The reason not every company does it to all its employees is probably that for those employees, it wouldn't affect incentives much and it would make payment subject to the vagaries of the stock market. Your barista at Starbucks is not going to increase the stock price no matter how well he fills your order; at the same time, maybe he wants to know how much he takes home every day. If the story is \"it should be the law that every company offers stock options\", then that would be a dumb law for the reasons above. If the story is \"all companies must be fully employee-owned workers' cooperatives\", then first, note that you are calling for a restriction on workers' rights: they have to be given part of their pay as stocks, and they can't sell them freely. Second, that will probably make markets work worse. There's a large economics literature on this: worker-owned cooperatives have not taken over the market, although they are an available institutional form, because (a) they find it hard to raise capital (b) they tend to make decisions that maximize worker welfare rather than profit, e.g. they won't sack underperforming divisions or expand in ways that dilute existing workers' stake. reply stavros 11 hours agoparentThen maybe \"taking over the market\" is a bad metric, and we should be optimizing for making a company that makes the workers' lives better. The US cultural bias is showing here, as it's assumed that profit is above all else, and a company that forgoes profit to make workers happier must thus be less good. The vast majority of people in companies are workers. Let's stop optimizing for owner wealth and start optimizing for worker happiness instead. reply sotix 6 hours agorootparent> The US cultural bias is showing here, as it's assumed that profit is above all else I asked my Greek teacher what they biggest change she experienced moving to the US was, and she said that in Greece, her community prioritized happiness above all else, but everyone she met in the US prioritized making money. I also asked her what the financial crisis was like in Greece, and she said that you couldn’t find an empty seat at a taverna in her village on the weekends. They barely had any money, and few around her were employed, but they had certain priorities.

That by itself already puts small scale cooperatives at a competitive disadvantage, you can't raise as much capital as the non-cooperative startup, even if their product could be better and their employers could be happier the lavishly monied startup will try to outcompete them by throwing money away until they get a larger share of the market.

I think the idea is, keeping a market relatively free (with a sane amount of regulation) allows capital to seek returns. This leads to a lot of independent, decentralized value production, like startups popping up out of nowhere because some founders have an idea and attract capital. The thing is, people who pile up capital don’t have to be efficient with it. They can basically do whatever they want with their money. They can build giant vanity estates, which you could certainly call inefficient — who needs 20,000 square feet for a family of 3? But… we also care about freedom, so we let people do inefficient things. The only difference between rich people and poor people is they have more money so their inefficiencies are louder. But everybody spends money on senseless wants and vanity. Who needs manicures and hair extensions? Arguably nobody. The “poor” spend on vanity too. And we let them because we care about freedom.

Similarly, consider that 20k ft sq mansion in context: all the prior owner(s) of that property were traded revenue for the land. And the construction workers were paid. And now the gov gets taxes.

If the metric you are tracking is instead covering general population health or things easily caught with preventative medicine, then the US scores abysmally in those metrics. In other words, the US healthcare system actually turns out to be very good (if perhaps not on a per-cost metric)... but access to the good healthcare system is extremely poor.

Of course compared to pretty much every highly developed country if we factor in relative spending per capita you'd be right. But yeah, purely market/profit driven systems (with extremely poor and inefficient regulation) certainly don't work in certain sectors like healthcare. Also it depends on what do you mean by 'socialized medicine', if you're specifically talking about single payer, your point is only valid if you ignore all other countries which don't have single payer besides the US. The Swiss and (as far as I can tell) to a lesser Dutch healthcare systems are 'privatized' to a much higher degree than the one in US i.e. effectively fully, there are no Medicare/Medicaid equivalents there. Instead they are very strictly and relatively efficiently regulated. They pretty much have Obama/Romneycare++. If you mean something else than single-payer then the US system is arguably heavily 'socialized', both through insurance polling (just like in the countries I mentioned) and because the US government itself spends more on healthcare than most industrialized countries even relative to GDP. e.g. if we exclude all private spending (both individual and insurance) government health spending per capita in the US is significantly higher than in Britain and more than 2x higher than in Spain (and still significantly higher if adjusted by PPP GDP per capita) https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.GHED.PP.CD?locat... reply WalterBright 2 hours agorootparentprevThe US health care system is primarily run by the government. reply jazz9k 4 hours agorootparentprevSocialized systems are subsidized by the US drug companies.

Therefore you can't really allow both in the system/country. So realistically \"socialism\" can only exist if the state suppresses any alternatives using various degrees of coercion and force. Since no real competition and by extension dissent can exist (i.e. nobody has enough resources to challenge the state without significantly damaging their career/status/wellbeing) the state ends up becoming more and more oppressive/controlling and unavoidable corrupt.

You could make a similar case that making decisions solely around stock price leads to underperformance as well, if we quantify \"performance\" in terms of value provided to the broader economy. Mass layoffs are great for stock price, but they deal serious damage to your institutional knowledge base. Rather than simply shuttering an underperforming division, if you buy out the ownership stakes of the people working there, they'll have cash to re-train with. If we find that co-ops have a tendency to avoid doing that when necessary, we can tweak the incentives and subsidize a portion of the buyout, under certain circumstaces. Subsidies to tweak incentives are nothing new. > This isn't something that anyone can decide upon Yes, it is.

In the worst case, these performative interventions create harmful unintended consequences at the same time, leading to them being a net negative. It's worth noting, also, that nothing other than \"actual humans\" are involved in any aspect of this.

At the end of the day, people need to be willing to pay a business in exchange for its goods and services, and if they don't feel like they are obtaining net positive value from the transaction, they won't be. reply consteval 1 hour agorootparentI think key word here is \"feel\". The reality is that modern products are absurdly complex, and consumers truly don't know what is (and isn't) worth their money. Which is why marketing, making people \"feel\" a certain way, is SO important. Maybe even more important than the product itself. I mean, do you know how any of your food is produced? If you wanted to verify that the ingredients are what they say they are, can you? If you're buying a car how confident are you the transmission is reliable? Do you actually understand how the transmission is designed OR... is it just brand name? It's brand name, right. Ultimately companies don't need to, and are better off not, producing high quality and safe goods. It makes much more sense to produce lower quality goods and reinvest the savings into advertising. The consumer won't know the difference, and they couldn't find out even if they wanted to. reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparentprev> if they don't feel like they are obtaining net positive value from the transaction, they won't be. Excepting for the cases where people have no other choice. reply stavros 11 hours agorootparentprevWhy? It sounds good to me. reply vrotaru 6 hours agorootparentJust an example. Should teachers be judged on how a pleasant life they live, or how good they teach? reply Qwertious 6 hours agorootparentThat's not as relevant as you'd think - the \"customers\" of teachers are, arguably, taxpayers and not children. Alternatively it's parents, or perhaps politicians who set the budget. Focusing on children is the more pro-social preference, but children who attend schools famously don't have jobs in functioning societies. More importantly, the teaching system is basically un-incentivized by incentives - teachers in the US (focusing just on the US for a sec) are incredibly underpaid, and basically rely on masters-degree teachers putting in effort completely disproportionate to the pay. Everyone accepts this state of affairs specifically because we're all ignoring market incentives in favor of the good of society (i.e. the quality of childrens' education). So, let's suppose we judge teachers based on how well they appease politicians and parents who support their funding: they pass all students, regardless of how poorly they do on tests and how badly the children need to just repeat the year. This is a terrible outcome, and yet you're implicitly endorsing it. reply vundercind 5 hours agorootparentprevI assure you that being allowed to teach well would greatly increase the pleasantness of life for a hell of a lot of teachers. Nobody gets into teaching for the money—and, for that matter, there’s not a clear connection between doing it well and any kind of rewards at all, as it stands. reply chasd00 1 hour agorootparentTeaching is a good example. When you teach in public schools which is basically where the \"people own the means of production\" since the school is paid for by the taxes collected by an elected government, you're absolutely right. No rewards for quality teaching basically at all. However, if you're really good at teaching you can teach at a private school and reap a lot more rewards. Better pay, better recognition, a better work environment this list goes on and on. /wife is a teacher and has taught in both public and private highschool reply Droobfest 6 hours agorootparentprevObviously by how well they teach, but if we give them a stake in their teaching performance, their teaching should improve even more… reply seneca 5 hours agorootparentThey do have a stake in their performance. It's their salary. If their performance is poor, in a functioning system they lose that salary. reply kerkeslager 3 hours agorootparentprevWell, it sounds like a step up from most companies, which is don't optimize for consumers, don't optimize for producers, optimize for shareholders. reply Arainach 11 hours agorootparentprevStop optimizing for financial leeches sucking value out of the system and externalizing all the societal consequences, start optimizing for the vast majority of the population. ....sounds better when you elaborate on the categories you selected. reply robertlagrant 10 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of the population are consumers. Each of us consumes far more services than we produce. Making life better for consumers is making life better for everyone. reply brabel 8 hours agorootparentYou're ignoring the proportions. Your happiness is maybe 80% related to your job and salary (at least up to a point where you can be considered wealthy, after that there's decreasing returns), and each product you consume from each different company affects your wellbeing by a minuscule amount. Even adding them all up won't give more than, say, 15% as most of your expenses are not on products, but things like housing and transport. Given that, if you could make everyone's jobs more fullfilling and increase people's salaries at the cost of things costing a bit more, you would definitely increase overall wellbeing. People would afford a small amount less, but that would not impact them significantly, or maybe at all. The problem I see is that in global competition, you may be put out of business by countries that give much less shit about worker's wellbeing because people will still spend almost all their money on the cheapest available option (even more so if they can afford less!), and that IMHO explains why American companies have taken over so many markets overseas (and now, China seems to be doing it even more). When that happens, everyone in the country loses. So there needs to be a balance, which I think Europe is doing more or less well: people still have great working conditions but can afford less than in the USA, where people have very near the worst possible working conditions (nearly no vacation mandated by law, no parental leave, no healthcare except for the best jobs), but can buy more useless stuff. reply mantas 7 hours agorootparentEU is on the same path. Actually even worse with over-the-top ecological requirements. Making it harded for local businesses, while making trade deals with iffy countries left and right. For now it's rolling on selling assets to China or US. But obviously that's not sustainable long term. Either we need to protect our internal market and tax the crap out of imports, or the party will be over. reply Qwertious 6 hours agorootparent>Actually even worse with over-the-top ecological requirements. That seems hard to judge in the short term - if in 50 years some economically-critical ecosystem collapses like the north atlantic fisheries did, they will have been absolutely necessary in retrospect. reply mantas 16 minutes agorootparentNo matter what ecological requirements would EU impose on local businesses, the rest of the world would happily pollute to cover its part. And eu itself would by that stuff. Point in case - fertilizers. EU regulations for fertilizer plants are getting stricter and stricter. Local produce prices are sky-high, especially after cheap gas was cut off. Yet imports from Russia (!!!) are massive. davidcbc 6 hours agorootparentprevGiven that wealth is continually being concentrated towards the very rich I don't think this is accurate. As a whole the working class is producing more value than they are consuming, but the excess is going to the rich not those producing the value reply tempfile 8 hours agorootparentprevBy definition, the average person consumes as much as they produce. Generally speaking, the poorer someone is, the more they produce relative to what they consume. Making life better for producers improves the lot of the poor; making life better for consumes improves it for the overconsumers (i.e. the rich). reply fuzzfactor 3 hours agorootparentprev>Each of us consumes far more services than we produce. Speak for yourself, not everyone is in debt all the time, and some never in debt whatsoever even when they have no unusually above-average earnings. But as part of a vast majority, you are as correct as possible. Then again capital is just plain Other Peoples' Money, and you can't be a capitalist without capital, no matter how much you wish it was true. One problem with housing is that real estate has investment potential but for decades it has been too expensive for average people. Debt is crafted to barely make it possible to get into a property, and you may do well if values increase but there is an entire system in place so that others profit more from the same piece of property than you. Vehicles are another high-dollar item where debt is usually incurred, but these almost always depreciate fast. You can draw the line there and be pretty realistic, but there are plenty of people who are at the extreme where everything that costs money is borrowed. So that's about as close to capitalist as most people get. That's about all of OPM they have at their disposal, and the only thing invested in that has upside potential is the home. For those fortunate enough to have gotten in when it was more within reach. And there can still be a gradual spiral downward which is too slow to notice until it's too late. Sometimes it helps to do the math and not be afraid to admit how far from capitalist you actually are compared to how capitalist everbody thinks they are.

    "originLink": "https://jordaneldredge.com/notes/corrupted-skins/",
    "originBody": "The bizarre secrets I found investigating corrupt Winamp skins Jul 24, 2024 In January of 2021 I was exploring the corpus of Skins I collected for the Winamp Skin Museum and found some that seemed corrupted, so I decided to explore them. Winamp skins are actually just zip files with a different file extension, so I tried extracting their files to see what I could find. This ended up leading me down a series of wild rabbit holes where I found: Encrypted files which I was able to crack to discover their secrets A gift a dad in Thailand had made for his two and a half year old son, but didn’t want published online Somebody’s email password A secret biography of Chet Baker Cryptic backwards audio files A file called worm.exe which held quite the surprise A host of extremely random images and files 56 previously unknown Winamp skins hidden inside other Winamp skins! This all aligned perfectly with my love of Winamp, my love of found items and was enabled by storing all the data I have about these skins in an sqlite database (as discussed on Hacker News). Here’s the story: The first corrupted file I looked at contained just a PDF advertising a rentable bowling pin mascot costume: Another was called bobs_car.wsz and, as advertised, contained just this picture, which I have to assume is the titular “Bob’s car”. But then things got interesting. I found one that was an encrypted zip archive. resubmitted.2003_rsx.wsz I took the opportunity to learn about tools for brute forcing passwords in zip files. Soon enough, I cracked it, and found its contents: The password was \"honda”. No idea why it might have been encrypted. Another one had been created by a dad in Thailand who made an Adobe Illustrator mock up illustration of a Winamp skin he had designed as a gift to his two and a half year old son. But he didn't know how to make it a skin, so he sent it to winamp.com (along with a text file letter) asking that it be made into a skin that he could use. The letter was very touching but he asked them not to share the skin, so I have not included it here. I found another encrypted zip file. This time the password was not in my wordlist. After a bit of fiddling with the cracking tool’s config file, I was able to brute force it as well. The result was a valid Winamp skin! Password was \"nayane”. I went ahead and uploaded the decrypted version here. This got me interested in other “sensitive” things that might be included in skins, so I started searching for things like “password” inside the files inside all the Winamp skins. I found one with a file called E-mail passwords.txt which contained… their email address and email password. Not great operational security. Another skin contained a text file with hundreds of blank lines and then, at the very bottom, the text: YOU HAVE FOUND THE SUPRISE!!! USE THIS PASSWORD:KEWL16 Inside the skin was a file Suprise!.zip which was itself encrypted, but the password didn’t work! Eventually I figured out that the password needed to be lower case. Inside were a bunch of .avs files: This skin included a file named secret.txt which was just a biography of Chet Baker. Some skins included mp3s inside them: sqlite> SELECT skin_md5, file_name FROM archive_files WHERE file_name LIKE \"%.mp3\"; 105a63846a068bcd2199f3921c006c99|winampme/MSNet d�marrage Win-Me.mp3 125a87ff1e2b7bce537aa3126b1a80d8|cool.mp3 329105cd7d11d3ec1236a7333a6b46e9|WILLIAM/Winamp Skin/MegaMan/Megaman/[MegaMan X] - X Theme.mp3 57a98f6b68236dd22a006fc8171f94b5|SPARKY.MP3 7653b2504bc3d9404a17c8eca7ba71af|Knuckle-Duster/hagmans_demo.mp3 86080023e53a798ccda91109d33abeb7|arrrrrrg.mp3 9f9c65a5d416d1a97f18dd8488e8cf7b|Blair Amp Project f/Heather_Sorry.mp3 a5a3a08340feb5dae3aa87af698b0654|cool.mp3 b6a51893dde10f4bcbee50a1fa24b217|(Adam Sandler - Billy Madison - Back 2 School).mp3 b6a51893dde10f4bcbee50a1fa24b217|(Mike Myers - Huge Head).mp3 b6cf670eb351e2e76f9048a25aeb639d|Diablo.mp3 b8ba93a4d427d8fd4f4c5fba7bcba627|BROTHEL - Breathe Swallow.mp3 b8ba93a4d427d8fd4f4c5fba7bcba627|BROTHEL - Fuck That Noise.mp3 b8ba93a4d427d8fd4f4c5fba7bcba627|BROTHEL - SunScreen2000.mp3 c647cd24f5809664e0d2e210a68310c1|SKATEBOARDING - Osiris ShoesTheme.mp3 c9b348ae2b93471b76ee2634a12d1dce|The Mark, Tom and Travis show/Blink 182 - Dammit (Sample).mp3 d54e166f5227967e153ec40783473c0b|cos-xenu.mp3 d54e166f5227967e153ec40783473c0b|lrh-xenu.mp3 e47edeecb002afecf1b30ebab8c8d1e9|Destroy v2.0.mp3 fcf17a808fdb485bb3e95a64debea848|Diablo.mp3 For example this bizarre five second cool.mp3. cool.mp3 This skin included a file named Sovergein Sect.wav.

Some days later I found a skin that contained just one file: WORM.EXE That sounds dangerous! I fed it to Virus Total but it didn’t detect any issues. So, someone in the Webamp Discord bravely tried running it in a VM and got this prompt: It was a worm game, like the game snake! Here’s top speed: Another skin had just one file Standing around the hoop.jpg Another one contained just a single file ellie.bmp Here’s Ellie I suppose? Reencoded as .png Another had two new born baby pictures and a text file: Here is a few pictures of Dom's baby. Joe Finally, I thought to look for skins that contained other skins within them, and discovered 127 skins! 54 of which were not already in the museum, so I uploaded them. It’s so interesting how if you get a large enough number of things that were created by real people, you can end up finding all kinds of crazy stuff! This was such an amazingly strange and interesting ride!

I was hugely into the scene of making/releasing skins for any/every program that included the ability (and a bunch that didn’t, thanks to unsigned applications). To this day I’m the type to customise everything I own and I despise staring at generic looking programs all day. It’s even worse when it’s stuff like Discord that has a very opinionated style that won’t even respect the small amount of customisation my Linux theming gives me. I feel like a huge reason the indie web died off was OSes and programs limiting user customisation which was a gateway drug for many. MySpace themes would get people learning html/css. Winamp skins got people learning photoshop/graphics. mIRC scripting taught people basic coding. OS customising had all of it. Now you just shut up and use it as they dictate. reply donatj 26 minutes agoparentI truly miss working in software in the early 2000's. We were all using XP but it was all customized up the wazoo. Almost all of us had custom themes and icons and what not.

I, in no small part, owe my career as a software dev to falling in love with Linux because of the ability to theme everything, apps, desktops, ui toolkits.

My pictures from the end of high school have a similar vibe, despite having no basketball. reply bityard 2 hours agorootparentIt's not from a digicam, it's a scan of a photo. The white bar on the left is from a subpar cropping job and is slightly crooked. The resolution (1275x1167) is higher than a typical 3:4 digital image sensor of the day, which would have maxed out at 640x480 in the late '90s to early 2000's, maybe 1024x768 for a really high-spec (expensive and uncommon) camera. As for the \"look\", I'm not a photographer but this was likely taken on either a low-end handheld film camera or disposable jobbie, which were absolutely ubiquitous around this time frame because they were so cheap (practically free, until you went to develop them). The picture was taken on an overcast day at dusk, later in the evening. Just dark enough to auto-trigger the insufficient flash which lights up the middle of the image and puts everything in the periphery in a dark shadow. I do like that the kid with the beer isn't looking at the camera and seems to have missed the point that everyone was supposed to be holding the ball. reply cpach 9 hours agorootparentprevWhen I look at the sky and the bricks I get the impression that the photo has “grain”.

I was always telling people, that you can make computers do your bidding, make them part of your life, frictionless. But I never needed IT help, I knew that whatever frustrations I might have are because of something I can work and fix with some digging around. But having things like Windows auto updates, websites ever changing makes even me feel the frustration and friction. It's no longer a wrench, it's a wireless corporate-run ad-powered e-wrench which needs printer ink for bolt-screwning. reply mcny 8 hours agorootparent> Windows auto updates if I remember correctly, Windows Updates were a pain in Windows 98 or even Windows XP. Maybe it was just a pain because I was on slow as molasses dial up but just the fact that active x(?) only worked on Microsoft Internet Explorer and it was required(?) for Windows Update, made me wonder why updating Windows requires a web browser. I think Windows auto updates are a good thing. I just think people should have to opt IN to auto updates for different stuff differently and then opt IN to automatic reboots. An operating system should never auto reboot without at least a one time user consent. Any corporate computer I've ever used disables this automatic reboot when a user is logged in. I think this is proof that the setting should be like this. Of course, over the long term, what we really need is to make more of updates not require a reboot, but that is a different conversation. reply elbelcho 6 hours agorootparentprevIt's no longer a wrench, it's a wireless corporate-run ad-powered e-wrench which needs printer ink for bolt-screwning.

The old internet was way less organized, which means that it was less useful, but it also gave this fantastic sense of exploring something new. It was highly personal, the lack of common standards meant that everyone had to reinvent the wheel in their own way. Its dangers were more direct and \"in your face\". Yes, you could stumble upon a pedofile on an open forum and ordering a taxi online was wrong on so many levels, but there was no systematic explotation of human weaknesses like we have nowadays. The phrase \"global village\" captures the experience really well, as opposed to the megacity we have now. I think it's a curse of progress.

I think the big reason why social media is toxic is because going online is no longer a choice and it follows you around. Some decisions by social media providers aren’t helping, but mobile is more guilty than social itself. reply hluska 13 hours agoparentprevIt might be somewhere between the two. The internet was messier back in the day. It didn’t feel as corporate and there was a strong spirit of sharing cool things because cool things are fun. Nowadays, it seems like everyone is just trying to get paid. And that’s fine because getting paid is fun too, but the spirit has changed. On the other hand, my eight year old is a big fan of a YouTube channel called Pilot Debrief. We just watched a documentary on the Gimli Glider and when we talked about it after, it was apparent that she has learned a tremendous amount about flying from that channel. So for my kid, that spirit of sharing cool things because cool things are fun is still going strong. And when I experience her experiencing things like that, I’m reminded that that spirit is still out there but I’m just old. reply ilrwbwrkhv 13 hours agoparentprevThe old internet is harder to find, which means its harder to ruin by normies.

    "originBody": "Research AI achieves silver-medal standard solving International Mathematical Olympiad problems Published 25 July 2024 Authors AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry teams Share Breakthrough models AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 solve advanced reasoning problems in mathematics Artificial general intelligence (AGI) with advanced mathematical reasoning has the potential to unlock new frontiers in science and technology. We’ve made great progress building AI systems that help mathematicians discover new insights, novel algorithms and answers to open problems. But current AI systems still struggle with solving general math problems because of limitations in reasoning skills and training data. Today, we present AlphaProof, a new reinforcement-learning based system for formal math reasoning, and AlphaGeometry 2, an improved version of our geometry-solving system. Together, these systems solved four out of six problems from this year’s International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), achieving the same level as a silver medalist in the competition for the first time. Breakthrough AI performance solving complex math problems The IMO is the oldest, largest and most prestigious competition for young mathematicians, held annually since 1959. Each year, elite pre-college mathematicians train, sometimes for thousands of hours, to solve six exceptionally difficult problems in algebra, combinatorics, geometry and number theory. Many of the winners of the Fields Medal, one of the highest honors for mathematicians, have represented their country at the IMO. More recently, the annual IMO competition has also become widely recognised as a grand challenge in machine learning and an aspirational benchmark for measuring an AI system’s advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities. This year, we applied our combined AI system to the competition problems, provided by the IMO organizers. Our solutions were scored according to the IMO’s point-awarding rules by prominent mathematicians Prof Sir Timothy Gowers, an IMO gold medalist and Fields Medal winner, and Dr Joseph Myers, a two-time IMO gold medalist and Chair of the IMO 2024 Problem Selection Committee. “ The fact that the program can come up with a non-obvious construction like this is very impressive, and well beyond what I thought was state of the art. Prof Sir Timothy Gowers, IMO gold medalist and Fields Medal winner First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language for our systems to understand. In the official competition, students submit answers in two sessions of 4.5 hours each. Our systems solved one problem within minutes and took up to three days to solve the others. AlphaProof solved two algebra problems and one number theory problem by determining the answer and proving it was correct. This included the hardest problem in the competition, solved by only five contestants at this year’s IMO. AlphaGeometry 2 proved the geometry problem, while the two combinatorics problems remained unsolved. See our system's IMO 2024 solutions Each of the six problems can earn seven points, with a total maximum of 42. Our system achieved a final score of 28 points, earning a perfect score on each problem solved — equivalent to the top end of the silver-medal category. This year, the gold-medal threshold starts at 29 points, and was achieved by 58 of 609 contestants at the official competition. Graph showing performance of our AI system relative to human competitors at IMO 2024. We earned 28 out of 42 total points, achieving the same level as a silver medalist in the competition. AlphaProof: a formal approach to reasoning AlphaProof is a system that trains itself to prove mathematical statements in the formal language Lean. It couples a pre-trained language model with the AlphaZero reinforcement learning algorithm, which previously taught itself how to master the games of chess, shogi and Go. Formal languages offer the critical advantage that proofs involving mathematical reasoning can be formally verified for correctness. Their use in machine learning has, however, previously been constrained by the very limited amount of human-written data available. In contrast, natural language based approaches can hallucinate plausible but incorrect intermediate reasoning steps and solutions, despite having access to orders of magnitudes more data. We established a bridge between these two complementary spheres by fine-tuning a Gemini model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements, creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty. When presented with a problem, AlphaProof generates solution candidates and then proves or disproves them by searching over possible proof steps in Lean. Each proof that was found and verified is used to reinforce AlphaProof’s language model, enhancing its ability to solve subsequent, more challenging problems. We trained AlphaProof for the IMO by proving or disproving millions of problems, covering a wide range of difficulties and mathematical topic areas over a period of weeks leading up to the competition. The training loop was also applied during the contest, reinforcing proofs of self-generated variations of the contest problems until a full solution could be found. Process infographic of AlphaProof’s reinforcement learning training loop: Around one million informal math problems are translated into a formal math language by a formalizer network. Then a solver network searches for proofs or disproofs of the problems, progressively training itself via the AlphaZero algorithm to solve more challenging problems. A more competitive AlphaGeometry 2 AlphaGeometry 2 is a significantly improved version of AlphaGeometry. It’s a neuro-symbolic hybrid system in which the language model was based on Gemini and trained from scratch on an order of magnitude more synthetic data than its predecessor. This helped the model tackle much more challenging geometry problems, including problems about movements of objects and equations of angles, ratio or distances. AlphaGeometry 2 employs a symbolic engine that is two orders of magnitude faster than its predecessor. When presented with a new problem, a novel knowledge-sharing mechanism is used to enable advanced combinations of different search trees to tackle more complex problems. Before this year’s competition, AlphaGeometry 2 could solve 83% of all historical IMO geometry problems from the past 25 years, compared to the 53% rate achieved by its predecessor. For IMO 2024, AlphaGeometry 2 solved Problem 4 within 19 seconds after receiving its formalization. Illustration of Problem 4, which asks to prove the sum of ∠KIL and ∠XPY equals 180°. AlphaGeometry 2 proposed to construct E, a point on the line BI so that ∠AEB = 90°. Point E helps give purpose to the midpoint L of AB, creating many pairs of similar triangles such as ABE ~ YBI and ALE ~ IPC needed to prove the conclusion. New frontiers in mathematical reasoning As part of our IMO work, we also experimented with a natural language reasoning system, built upon Gemini and our latest research to enable advanced problem-solving skills. This system doesn’t require the problems to be translated into a formal language and could be combined with other AI systems. We also tested this approach on this year’s IMO problems and the results showed great promise. Our teams are continuing to explore multiple AI approaches for advancing mathematical reasoning and plan to release more technical details on AlphaProof soon. We’re excited for a future in which mathematicians work with AI tools to explore hypotheses, try bold new approaches to solving long-standing problems and quickly complete time-consuming elements of proofs — and where AI systems like Gemini become more capable at math and broader reasoning.

Where dumb search had failed to achieve the level of even a very weak player, the neural net's \"intuition\" about good moves without any search was already very strong. Only the combination was superhuman, and that was anything but the dumb search that had been tried before. Today's announcement is also not about proving Lean theorems by \"dumb search\". The success is about search + neural networks. You're attacking critics for criticizing the solution that has failed, while confusing it for the solution that works to this day. reply cs702 8 minutes agorootparentThat's in fact precisely my point: Clever forms of \"dumb search\" that leverage compute, DNNs, RL, self-play, and/or formal languages are not dumb at all.

It kinda had to be this way, I think. There's a something from nothing problem. Douglas Adams brilliantly starts at this point. We don't understand something from nothing. We don't even have the language to describe it. Concepts like \"complexity\" are frustratingly resistant to formalization. \"There is no free will.\" Has recently resurged as a philosophical position... like it did in response to Newton's mechanics. Matter from void. Life from minerals. Consciousness from electrons. Free will from deterministic components. Smart reasoning & intelligent rationalisation from dumb search, computation, DNNs and such. I don't think this debate was supposed to be ended by anything short of empirical demonstration.

Mathematicians have heuristics on helping us decide intuitively what's going to work what can make progress. But in the end--there is only search reply fspeech 33 minutes agoparentprevBy \"dumb\" I assume you meant brute-force. Search, as opposed to extrapolation, is what actually produces suprise or creative results, whether it happens in a person's head or on a computer.

(Maybe shares a foundational model with an English LLM; I don't know) It learns mathematical statements, and generates new mathematical statements, then uses search techniques to continue. Similar to Alpha Go's neural network, what makes it new and interesting is how the NN/LLM part makes smart guesses that drastically prune the search tree, before the brute-force search part. (This is also what humans do to solve math probrems. But humans are really, really slow at brute-force search, so we really almost entirely on the NN pattern-matching analogy-making part.) reply nnarek 2 hours agorootparentprevformal definition of first theorem already contain answer of the problem \"{α : ℝ∃ k : ℤ, Even k ∧ α = k}\" (which mean set of even real numbers).if they say that they have translated first problem into formal definition then it is very interesting how they initially formalized problem without including answer in it reply Smaug123 2 hours agorootparent(You're talking to one of the people who was part of the project, which is why I took @ocfnash's answer as authoritative: they did not cheat.) reply golol 2 hours agorootparentprevI would expect that in their data which they train AlphaProof on they have some concept of a \"vague problem\" whoch could just look like {Formal description of the set in question} = ? And then Alphaproof has to find candidate descriptions of this set and prove a theorem that they are equal to the above. I doubt they would claim to solve the problem if they provided half of the answer. reply riku_iki 2 hours agorootparentprevits not clear if theorem is actual input formal definition, or formal definition was in different form. reply pishpash 1 hour agorootparentprevExactly, a problem and its answer are just different ways of describing the same object. Every step of a proof is a transformation/translation of the same object. It would be disingenuous to say that some heavy lifting isn't done in formalizing a problem but it seems that step is also performed by a machine: \"We established a bridge between these two complementary spheres by fine-tuning a Gemini model to automatically translate natural language problem statements into formal statements, creating a large library of formal problems of varying difficulty.\" I'm confused, is the formalization by Gemini or \"manually\"? Which is it? reply cygaril 2 hours agorootparentprevCome up with many possible answers, formalize them all, and then try to prove or disprove each of them. reply summerlight 2 hours agoparentprevTo speak generally, that translation part is much easier than the proof part. The problem with automated translation is that the translation result might be incorrect. This happens a lot when even people try formal methods by their hands, so I guess the researchers concluded that they'll have to audit every single translation regardless of using LLM or whatever tools. reply thomasahle 1 hour agorootparentYou'd think that, but Timothy Gowers (the famous mathematician they worked with) wrote (https://x.com/wtgowers/status/1816509817382735986) > However, LLMs are not able to autoformalize reliably, so they got them to autoformalize each problem many times. Some of the formalizations were correct, but even the incorrect ones were useful as training data, as often they were easier problems. So didn't actually solve autoformalization, which is why they still needed humans to translate the input IMO 2024 problems. The reason why formalization is harder than you think is that there is no way to know if you got it right. You can use Reinforcement Learning with proofs and have a clear signal from the proof checker. We don't have a way to verify formalizations the same way. reply thrdbndndn 46 minutes agorootparent> However, LLMs are not able to autoformalize reliably, so they got them to autoformalize each problem many times. Some of the formalizations were correct, but even the incorrect ones were useful as training data, as often they were easier problems. A small detail wasn't clear to me: for these incorrectly formalized problems, how do they get the correct answer as ground truth for training? Have a human to manually solve them? (In contrast to problems actually from \"a huge database of IMO-type problems\", they do have answers for these already). reply adrianN 38 minutes agorootparentYou write proofs in a formal language that can be machine checked. If the checker is happy, the proof is correct (unless there is a bug in the checker, but that is unlikely). reply llwu 58 minutes agorootparentprev> We don't have a way to verify formalizations the same way. While there is no perfect method, it is possible to use the agent to determine if the statement is false, has contradictory hypotheses, or a suspiciously short proof. reply ajross 1 hour agorootparentprev> To speak generally, that translation part is much easier than the proof part. To you or me, sure. But I think the proof that it isn't for this AI system is that they didn't do it. Asking a modern LLM to \"translate\" something is a pretty solved problem, after all. That argues strongly that what was happening here is not a \"translation\" but something else, like a semantic distillation. If you ask a AI (or person) to prove the halting problem, they can't. If you \"translate\" the question into a specific example that does halt, they can run it and find out. I'm suspicious, basically. reply dooglius 2 hours agoparentprevThe linked page says > While the problem statements were formalized into Lean by hand, the answers within the problem statements were generated and formalized by the agent. However, it's unclear what initial format was given to the agents that allowed this step reply pclmulqdq 1 hour agorootparentSo if Lean was used to find the answers, where exactly is the AI? A thin wrapper around Lean? reply dooglius 1 hour agorootparentLean checks that the proof is valid, it didn't find the proof. reply xrisk 1 hour agorootparentprevLean is just the language, Presumably to drive the AI towards the program (“the proof”) reply pishpash 1 hour agorootparentprevThe AI is the \"solver network\", which is the (directed) search over solutions generated by Lean. The AI is in doing an efficient search, I suppose. I'm also waiting for my answer on the role of the Gemini formalizer, but reading between the lines, it looks like it was only used during training the \"solver network\", but not used in solving the IMO problems. If so then the hyping is greatly premature, as the hybrid formalizer/solver is the whole novelty of this, but it's not good enough to use end-to-end? You cannot say AlphaProof learned enough to solve problems if formalization made them easier to solve in the first place! You can say that the \"solver network\" part learned enough to solve formalized problems better than prior training methods. reply Smaug123 2 hours agorootparentprevFWIW, GPT-4o transcribed a screenshot of problem 1 perfectly into LaTeX, so I don't think \"munge the problem into machine-readable form\" is per se a difficult part of it these days even if they did somehow take shortcuts (which it sounds like they didn't). reply pclmulqdq 1 hour agorootparentComparing \"turn photo into LaTeX\" to \"translate theorems into Lean\" is like comparing a child's watercolor drawing to the Mona Lisa. reply Smaug123 1 hour agorootparent… no? After the LaTeX output, I told stock GPT4o that the answer was \"all even integers\", and asked for the statement in Lean. I had to make two changes to its output (both of which were compile-time errors, not misformalisations), and it gave me the formalisation of the difficult direction of the problem. Both changes were trivial: it had one incorrect (but unnecessary) import, and it used the syntax from Lean 3 instead of Lean 4 in one lambda definition. A system that was trained harder on Lean would not make those mistakes. The one actual error it made was in not proposing that the other direction of the \"if and only if\" is required. Again, I am quite confident that this formalisation failure mode is not hard to solve in a system that is, like, actually trained to do this. Obviously formalising problems that a working mathematicican solves is dramatically harder than formalising IMO problems, and is presumably way ahead of the state of the art. reply zerocrates 2 hours agoparentprevInteresting that they have a formalizer (used to create the training data) but didn't use it here. Not reliable enough? reply golol 2 hours agoparentprev> When presented with a problem, AlphaProof generates solution candidates and then proves or disproves them by searching over possible proof steps in Lean. To me, this sounds like Alphaproof receives a \"problem\", whatever that is (how do you formalize \"determine all X such that...\"? One is asked to show that an abstract set is actually some easily understandable set...). Then it generates candidate Theorems, persumably in Lean. I.e. the set is {n: P(n)} for some formula or something. Then it searches for proofs. I think if Alphaproof did not find {foo} but it was given then it would be very outrageous to claim that it solved the problem. I am also very hyped. reply kurthr 1 hour agoparentprevAs is often the case, creating a well formed problem statement often takes as much knowledge (if not work) as finding the solution. But seriously, if you can't ask the LLM to solve the right question, you can't really expect it to give you the right answer unless you're really lucky. \"I'm sorry, but I think you meant to ask a different question. You might want to check the homework set again to be sure, but here's what I think you really want.\" reply golol 2 hours agoprevThis is the real deal. AlphaGeometry solved a very limited set of problems with a lot of brute force search. This is a much broader method that I believe will have a great impact on the way we do mathematics. They are really implementing a self-feeding pipeling from natural language mathematics to formalized mathematics where they can train both formalization and proving. In principle this pipeline can also learn basic theory building like creating auxilliary definitions and Lemmas. I really think this is the holy grail of proof-assistance and will allow us to formalize most mathematics that we create very naturally. Humans will work podt-rigorously and let the machine asisst with filling in the details. reply visarga 1 hour agoparent> a lot of brute force search Don't dismiss search, it might be brute force but it goes beyond human level in Go and silver at IMO. Search is also what powers evolution which created us, also by a lot of brute forcing, and is at the core of scientific method (re)search. reply thomasahle 1 hour agorootparentAlso AlphaProof had to search for 60 hours for one of the IMO problems it solved. reply Davidzheng 1 hour agorootparentprevYes and there's a lot of search here too. That's a key to the approach reply Eridrus 1 hour agorootparentprevSearch is great, search works, but there was not a tonne to learn from the AlphaGeometry paper unless you were specifically interested in solving geometry problems. reply kypro 1 hour agorootparentprevMy old AI professor used to say that every problem is a search problem.

Where does it say the search space has to be small? reply gowld 22 minutes agorootparentprevWhat makes solving IMO problems hard is usually the limits of human memory, pattern-matching, and search, not creativity. After all, these are problems that are already solved, and it is expected that many people can solve the problems in about 1 hour's time. That makes it, in principle, similar or even easier than a champsionship-level chess move, which often take more than 1 hour for a professional human (with more training than an IMO high school student) to solve. reply Ericson2314 2 hours agoprevThe lede is a bit buried: they're using Lean!

There's no reason to draw artificial boundaries around where the AI is and where the tools that the AI is using are. Lean itself is a traditional symbolic artificial intelligence system.

Also, for what it's worth, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have been able to solve it myself in three days, even if I had access to all of GCP, Azure and AWS (except if I could mine crypto to then pay actual IMO-level mathematicians to solve it for me). reply nnarek 2 hours agorootparentyes it is very impressive, especially autoformalization of problems written in natural language and also proof search of theorems reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is though, once we have a benchmark that we pass, it’s pretty typical to be able to bring down time required in short order through performance improvements and iterating on ideas. So if you knew you had GAI but it took 100% of all GCP for 3 years to give a result, within the next 5 years that would come down significantly (not least of which you’d build HW dedicated to accelerating the slow parts). reply tsimionescu 2 hours agorootparentThat's patently false for many classes of problems. We know exactly how to solve the traveling salesman problem, and have for decades, but we're nowhere close to solving a random 1000 city case (note: there are approximate methods that can find good, but not optimal, results on millions of cities). Edit: I should say 1,000,000 city problem, as there are some solutions for 30-60k cities from the 2000s. And there are good reasons to believe that theorem finding and proof generation are at least NP-hard problems. reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentWe're not talking about mathematical optimality here, both from the solution found and for the time taken. The point is whether this finds results more cheaply than a human can and right now it's better on some problems while others it's worse. Clearly if a human can do it, there is a way to solve it in a cheaper amount of time and it would be flawed reasoning to think that improving the amount of time would be asymptotically optimal already. While I agree that not all problems show this kind of acceleration in performance, that's typically only true if you've already spent so much time trying to solve it that you've asymptoted to the optimal solution. Right now we're nowhere near the asymptote for AI improvements. Additionally, there's so many research dollars flowing into AI precisely because the potential upside here is nowhere near realized and there's lots of research lines still left to be explored.

Given the vagueness probably on the higher end, otherwise they'd celebrate it more. The students had 6 tasks in 9 hours, so on average 1.5h per task. If you add the time a student would take to (correctly!) translate the problems to their input format, their best-case runtime is probably about as fast as a silver-medalist would take to solve the problem on their own. But even if they aren't as fast as humans yet this is very valuable. Both as a stepping stone, and because at a certain scale compute is much easier to scale than skilled mathematicians. reply gjm11 2 hours agorootparentThey say \"our systems\" (presumably meaning AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2) solved one problem \"within minutes\", and later on the page they say that the geometry question (#4) was solved by AlphaGeometry in 19 seconds. So either (1) \"within minutes\" was underselling the abilities of the system, or (2) what they actually meant was that the geometry problem was solved in 19 seconds, one of the others \"within minutes\" (I'd guess #1 which is definitely easier than the other two they solved), and the others in unspecified times of which the longer was ~3 days. I'd guess it's the first of those. (Euclidean geometry has been a kinda-solved domain for some time; it's not super-surprising that they were able to solve that problem quickly.)

If the IMO contestants were allowed to use theorem provers and were given 3 days (even factoring in sleep) would AlphaProof still have gotten silver? > let's be real I'd be okay waiting a month for the cure to cancer. I don't think these results suggest that we're on the brink of knowledge coming at a substantially faster rate than before.

Now an LLM has been wired up to one too, but it still took 8x as long to solve the problems as our best humans did without any computer assistance. reply golol 2 hours agorootparentI believe you are misreading this. First of all, this is not a sport and the point is not to compare AI to humans. The point is to compare AI to IMO-difficulty problems. Secondly, this is now some hacky trick where Brute force and some theorem prover magic are massaged to solve a select few problems and then you'll never hear about it again. They are building a general pipeline which turns informal natural lamguage mathematics (of which we have ungodly amounts available) into formalized mathematics, and in addition trains a model to prove such kinds of mathematics.

(Source: I used to do math comps back in the day sorry it's not a great source) reply robinhouston 2 hours agoprevSome more context is provided by Tim Gowers on Twitter [1]. Since I think you need an account to read threads now, here's a transcript: Google DeepMind have produced a program that in a certain sense has achieved a silver-medal peformance at this year's International Mathematical Olympiad. It did this by solving four of the six problems completely, which got it 28 points out of a possible total of 42. I'm not quite sure, but I think that put it ahead of all but around 60 competitors. However, that statement needs a bit of qualifying. The main qualification is that the program needed a lot longer than the human competitors -- for some of the problems over 60 hours -- and of course much faster processing speed than the poor old human brain. If the human competitors had been allowed that sort of time per problem they would undoubtedly have scored higher. Nevertheless, (i) this is well beyond what automatic theorem provers could do before, and (ii) these times are likely to come down as efficiency gains are made. Another qualification is that the problems were manually translated into the proof assistant Lean, and only then did the program get to work. But the essential mathematics was done by the program: just the autoformalization part was done by humans. As with AlphaGo, the program learnt to do what it did by teaching itself. But for that it needed a big collection of problems to work on. They achieved that in an interesting way: they took a huge database of IMO-type problems and got a large language model to formalize them. However, LLMs are not able to autoformalize reliably, so they got them to autoformalize each problem many times. Some of the formalizations were correct, but even the incorrect ones were useful as training data, as often they were easier problems. It's not clear what the implications of this are for mathematical research. Since the method used was very general, there would seem to be no obvious obstacle to adapting it to other mathematical domains, apart perhaps from insufficient data. So we might be close to having a program that would enable mathematicians to get answers to a wide range of questions, provided those questions weren't too difficult -- the kind of thing one can do in a couple of hours. That would be massively useful as a research tool, even if it wasn't itself capable of solving open problems. Are we close to the point where mathematicians are redundant? It's hard to say. I would guess that we're still a breakthrough or two short of that. It will be interesting to see how the time the program takes scales as the difficulty of the problems it solves increases. If it scales with a similar ratio to that of a human mathematician, then we might have to get worried. But if the function human time taken --> computer time taken grows a lot faster than linearly, then more AI work will be needed. The fact that the program takes as long as it does suggests that it hasn't \"solved mathematics\". However, what it does is way beyond what a pure brute-force search would be capable of, so there is clearly something interesting going on when it operates. We'll all have to watch this space. 1. https://x.com/wtgowers/status/1816509803407040909?s=46 reply visarga 1 hour agoparent> If the human competitors had been allowed that sort of time per problem they would undoubtedly have scored higher. Or if AlphaProof used more compute they could have slashed that time to 1/10 or less. It's arbitrary as long as we don't define what is the compute the AI should be entitled to use here. reply majikaja 2 hours agoprevIt would be nice if on the page they included detailed descriptions of the proofs it came up with, more information about the capabilities of the system and insights into the training process... If the data is synthetic and covers a limited class of problems I would imagine what it's doing mostly reduces to some basic search pattern heuristics which would be of more value to understand than just being told it can solve a few problems in three days. reply cygaril 2 hours agoparentProofs are here: https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/B... reply majikaja 1 hour agorootparentI found those, I just would have appreciated if the content of the mathematics wasn't sidelined to a separate download as if it's not important. I felt the explanation on the page was shallow, as if they just want people to accept it's a black box. All I've learnt from this is that they used an unstated amount of computational resources just to basically brute force what a human already is capable of doing in far less time. reply Davidzheng 1 hour agorootparentVery few humans can after years of training.

So they were partly solved by the AI reply golol 2 hours agoparentFormalization is in principle just a translation process and should be a much simpler problem than the actual IMO problem. Besides, they also trained a Gemini model which formalizes natural language problems, and this is how they generated training data for AlphaProof. I would therefore expect that they could have also formalized the IMO problems with that model and just did it manually because the point is not to demonstrate formalizing but instead proof capabilities. reply pishpash 1 hour agorootparentYet the facts at hand are the opposite of what you say. Reliable formalizer was the more difficult problem than solving formalized IMO problems, because they have not produced one. reply riku_iki 1 hour agorootparentprev> Formalization is in principle just a translation process and should be a much simpler problem than the actual IMO problem maybe not, because you need to connect many complicated topics/terms/definitions together, and you don't have a way to reliably verify if formalized statement is correct. They built automatic formalization network in this case, but didn't trust it and formalized it manually. reply jeremyjh 3 hours agoparentprevYes and it is difficult for me to believe that there is not useful human analysis and understanding involved in this translation that the AI is helpless without. But that I suppose is a problem that could be tackled with a different model... reply adrianN 2 hours agorootparentEven so, having a human formalize the problems and an AI to find machine checkable proofs could be very useful for mathematicians. reply trotro 1 hour agoparentprevBut formalization is the easy part for humans. I'm sure every mathematician would be be happy if the only thing required to prove a result was to formalize it in Lean and feed it to the AI to find the proof. reply clbrmbr 2 hours agoparentprevIIUC, a Gemini-based system could translate the natural language questions into Lean, but in the blog post they don’t really commit to whether this was done just to generate training data or was used in the competition. reply rpois 2 hours agoparentprevDoes this formalization process include giving it the answer it should try to prove? reply Smaug123 2 hours agorootparentNope, per Oliver Nash who worked on the thing: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41070372 reply PaulHoule 3 hours agoprevSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Mathematician for an early system that seems similar in some way. reply golol 2 hours agoparentThis Wikipedia page makes AM kind of comes across as a nonsense project whose outputs no one (besides the author) bothered to decipher. reply brap 1 hour agoprevAre all of these specialized models available for use?

There's AlphaCode, of course, but on the latest update I don't think it was quite on \"silver medal\" level. And available LLM's are probably not even on \"honourable mention\" level. I wonder if some class of problems will emerge that human competitors are able to solve but are particularly tricky for machines. And which characteristics these problems will have (e.g. they'll require some sort of intuition or visualization that is not easily formalized). Given how much of a dent LLM's are already making on beginner competitions (AtCoder recently banned using them on ABC rounds [1]), I can't help but think that soon these competitions will be very different.

Edit: To defend my response, the model definitely knows when it hasn't yet found a correct response, but this is categorically different from knowing that it does not know (and of course monkeys and typewriters etc., can always find a proof eventually if one exists). reply machiaweliczny 21 minutes agoprevGood, now use DiffusER on algebra somehow please reply lolinder 2 hours agoprevThis is a fun result for AI, but a very disingenuous way to market it. IMO contestants aren't allowed to bring in paper tables, much less a whole theorem prover. They're given two 4.5 hour sessions (9 hours total) to solve all the problems with nothing but pencils, rulers, and compasses [0]. This model, meanwhile, was wired up to a theorem proover and took three solid days to solve the problems. The article is extremely light on details, but I'm assuming that most of that time was guess-and-check: feed the theorem prover a possible answer, get feedback, adjust accordingly. If the IMO contestants were given a theorem prover and three days (even counting breaks for sleeping and eating!), how would AlphaProof have ranked? Don't get me wrong, this is a fun project and an exciting result, but their comparison to silver medalists at the IMO is just feeding into the excessive hype around AI, not accurately representing its current state relative to humanity. [0] 5.1 and 5.4 in the regulations: https://www.imo-official.org/documents/RegulationsIMO.pdf reply gjm11 2 hours agoparentWorking mathematicians mostly don't use theorem provers in their work, and find that when they do they go significantly more slowly (with of course the compensating advantage of guaranteeing no mistakes in the final result). A theorem prover is probably more useful for the typical IMO problem than for the typical real research problem, but even so I'd guess that even with a reasonable amount of training most IMO contestants would not do much better for having access to a theorem prover. Having three days would be a bigger deal, for sure. (But from \"computers can't do this\" to \"computers can do this, but it takes days\" is generally a much bigger step than from \"computers can do this, but it takes days\" to \"computers can do this in seconds\".) reply Davidzheng 58 minutes agoparentprevI can tell you that as someone who could have gotten bronze (i was too weak for the team) and is now a math phd--I would not have scored as well as alphaproof in three days most likely. In most problems either you find an idea soon or it can be much much longer. It's just not a matter of working and constant progress. reply golol 2 hours agoparentprevThe point is not to compare AI and humans, it is to compare AI and IMO-level math problems. It's not for sport. reply lolinder 2 hours agorootparentThey're literally comparing AI to human IMO contestants. \"DeepProof solves 4/6 IMO problems correctly\" would be the non-comparison version of this press release and would give a better sense for how it's actually doing. reply golol 2 hours agorootparent\"Solving IMO problems at Silver-Medal level\" is pretty much equivalent to solving something like 4/6 problems. It is only a disingenious comparison if you want to read it as a comparison. I mean yea, many people will, but I don't care anout them. People who are technically interested in this know that the point is not to have a competition of AI with humans. reply lolinder 2 hours agorootparent> but I don't care anout them It's great that you feel safe being so aloof, but I believe we have a responsibility in tech to turn down the AI hype valve. The NYT is currently running a piece with the headline \"Move Over, Mathematicians, Here Comes AlphaProof\". People see that, and people react, and we in tech are not helping matters by carelessly making false comparisons. reply visarga 1 hour agorootparentI think search-based AI is on a different level than imitation models like GPT. This is not a hallucinating model, and it could potentially discover things that are not written in any books. Search is amazing. Protein folding searches for the lowest energy configuration. Evolution searches for ecological fit. Culture searches for progress, and science for understanding. Even placing a foot on the ground searches for dynamic equilibrium. Training a ML model searches for best parateters to fit a dataset. Search is universal. Supervised learning is just imitative, search is extrapolative. reply golol 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy? Why is hype bad? What actual harm does it cause? Also the headline is fair, as I do believe that AlphaProof demonstrates an approach to mathematics that will indeed invade mathematicians workspaces. And I say that as a mathemstician. reply Davidzheng 56 minutes agorootparentFor sure. I feel like mathematicians are not paying attention (maybe deliberately) we have a real shot of solving some incredibly hard open problem in the next few years. reply kenjackson 2 hours agorootparentprevExactly. The point is what can we eventually get AI to solve problems which we as humans can’t. Not if we can win the IMO with a computer. reply blackbear_ 1 hour agoparentprevAnd why aren't you complaining that human participants could train and study for thousands of hours before attempting the problems? And that the training materials they used was itself created and perfected by hundreds of other people, after having themselves spend countless hours studying? reply lolinder 55 minutes agorootparentBecause so did the AI? reply blackbear_ 5 minutes agorootparentThat's exactly my point? Both had to learn? reply dmitrygr 48 minutes agoprev> First, the problems were manually translated into formal mathematical language That is more than half the work of solving them. Headline should read \"AI solves the simple part of each IMA problem at silver medal level\" reply skywhopper 2 hours agoprevExcept it didn’t. The problem statements were hand-encoded into a formal language by human experts, and even then only one problem was actually solved within the time limit. So, claiming the work was “silver medal” quality is outright fraudulent. reply noud 1 hour agoparentI had exactly the same feeling when reading this blog. Sure, the techniques used to find the solutions are really interesting. But the claim more than they achieve. The problem statements are not available in Lean, and the time limit is 2 x 4.5 hours. Not 3 days. The article claims they have another model that can work without formal languages, and that it looks very promising. But they don't mention how well that model performed. Would that model also perform at silver medal level? Also note, that if the problems are provided in a formal language, you can always find the solution in finite amount of time (provided the solution exists). You can brute-force over all possible solutions until you find the solution that proofs the statement. This may take a very long time, but it will find the solutions eventually. You will always solve all the problems and win the IMO at gold medal level. Alphaproof seems to do something similar, but takes smarter decisions which possible solutions to try and which once to skip. What would be the reason they don't achieve gold? reply StefanBatory 2 hours agoprevWow, that's absolutely impressive to hear! Also it's making me think that in 5-10 years almost all tasks involving computer scientists or mathematicians will be done in AI.

Competition problems are designed to be actually solvable by contestants. In particular, the problems should be solvable using a reasonable collection of techniques and many \"prep courses\" will teach you many techniques, tools and algorithms and a good starting point is to throw that stuff at any given problem. So just like chess openings putting in lots of leg work will give you some good results for that part. You might very well lose in mid and late game, just like this AI might struggle with \"actual problems\" It is of course still very impressive, but that is an important point. reply Smaug123 2 hours agorootparentI'm attacking nobody! I literally couldn't understand the point, so I said so: as stated, its premises are simply clearly false! Your point, however, is certainly a good one: IMO problems are an extremely narrow subset of the space of mathematical problems, which is itself not necessarily even 50% of the space of the work of a mathematician. reply energy123 2 hours agoparentprevIMO and Chess are the same in the most important respect, you can use Lean or a simulated chess game to create unlimited quality training labels. Any problem of this category should be solved with enough compute and clever architecture/metacognition design. The more intractable problems are where data is hard to find or synthesize. reply wufufufu 3 hours agoparentprevKinda? Chess isn't solved. Complex problems can have better solutions discovered in the future. reply jeremyjh 2 hours agorootparentIt isn't solved but the evaluation (which side is better, by how much, and which moves are best) of a strong engine is - for all practical purposes - an answer to every chess position you can pose to it.

EDIT TO ADD: It's fair to think that such a presser should not include answers to my questions. But, it's also fair to want that level of transparency given we are dealing with climate change. reply regularfry 56 minutes agorootparentYou're not wrong and in general the conclusion is that AI emits less CO2 than a human performing the same task.

It's that we are living in a period of time where there are very real consequences of nearly a century of unchecked CO2 due to human industry.

Basically what started happening at some point was that Maps had built in a “timeout” for the fetch of Saved lists. When the lists weren’t able to be downloaded/fetched in under X seconds, the system stopped trying, assuming that lists in general would always load in under X seconds. For users with huge lists, and for some users with very slow connections, it would timeout and not show anything. The way to notice it was typically when sharing the list, because the receiving user would fall into that timeout trap. The owner of the list usually didn’t notice immediately because the places were cached on their devices. It’s still being worked on, and being rolled out slowly..

I still use Google Maps as my default for transit, but Citymapper is considerably more reliable and I've been trying to remember to use it more. reply rolleiflex 9 minutes agorootparentA problem I had with CityMapper is that at the time I last used it, it used the distance units of the city you’re in, with no ability to change it. For example, if you’re in New York, the distances will be in feet, and feet only. Since I already know the public transport of my my own city and that I reach out for CityMapper when I’m travelling, it’s a jarring omission. I was incredulous enough to check with support, and sure enough they confirmed as of last year at least it is indeed the case that the units cannot be changed. reply standardUser 1 minute agorootparentThat's a pretty big oversight on their part. But when I'm in a tight spot (like train service is ending late at night) I've had CityMapper save my ass a few times when Google was showing me inaccurate information.

On the other hand, if you're serious about getting your application tested, people running open source browsers and operating systems are going to provide the most thorough testing and detailed problem reports. reply leptons 42 minutes agoparentEven for a beta this is clunky and practically unusable compared to Google Maps. It's pretty obvious that Apple still has a very long way to go to offer a competitive maps product. Google is just so far ahead of whatever this beta is. For example, I centered the map on my location in Los Angeles, CA and then clicked search for \"Gas Stations\", and it promptly reposition the map and gave me all the gas stations in San Jose, CA, a city hundreds of miles away. WTF? This is probably one of the most common use cases and they can't get it right. I managed to drop a pin somehow, not sure, and now I can't remove it and the map is stuck focusing on this random pin point. I don't see any UI for removing the dropped pin.

We have heard many times on HN that Google Maps (virtually) throws money out the window to keep it running so smoothly. Just keeping all the transit info correct for suggesting routes must be a nightmare. reply sksksk 11 hours agoparentMaps is table stakes for a smartphone, and having such a key feature provided by your main competitor is a huge risk. So purely on that basis, it could be worth it. Then, on top of that, there is value in the data you're able to collect. Traffic data is really valuable. Tracking the movement of vehicles and pedestrians lets you create very accurate maps based on \"real world\" data, you could use it to figure out really specific things like traffic light timings, diversions, pedestrian crossings, parking space, layout of private roads... At one point, Apple was working on a car, if you were making a self driving car, all that data would be useful for you, and beacuse of the value of it, competitors may not even sell it to you. So your only option is to generate it yourself. As for transit data, that is fairly simple, most transit agencies will publish their timetables in GTFS format, there are tools to automatically export this in scheduling software. That will probably get your 90% of the way there, so you might have a few on the groud people in major cities to tweak and make it more accurate, which is nothing for a company on the scale of Apple. reply dktp 6 hours agorootparentBack in the days Google notoriously launched turn-by-turn navigation on Android only. They bet on this being a big enough differentiator for people to use Android over iPhones. Apple then launched Apple maps - which at some point became quite good. Google quickly learned that they can't afford to make Android specific features in their apps or they risk losing large percentage of iOS users if Apple makes a competing product If Apple didn't respond with making their own maps, then maybe we would see more and more Android specific features, to the point where Android would become the dominating platform reply gunapologist99 3 hours agorootparentNot to put too fine a point on it, but Android is the dominating platform, except in the U.S.: https://explodingtopics.com/blog/iphone-android-users But this is also exactly the same game Apple plays against Android users.

In fact that's NOT the way Apple describes it, either (see the Apple article cited above), because Apple doesn't actually want to enable E2EE -- it only wants to be able to say it offers it. In practice, ensuring that other users are pressured into choosing iMessage on iPhone is the only thing that matters to Apple. https://www.npr.org/2024/03/28/1241443505/green-bubble-shami... And, this very simple trick works extremely well: at least 87% of teenagers in the U.S. (https://mashable.com/article/apple-messages-green-doj) are pre-programmed to buy an iPhone, even though they have the lowest disposable income of all. Meanwhile, less than a third of the overall global population owns an iPhone. Is that because iPhones are better? As an owner of both a recent Pro Max and Pixel Pro, I can unequivocally answer, \"no\", but I do find all of the annoyances between cross-device communication accrue to the point of just wanting to switch to my iPhone full-time, even though it's arguably a worse experience in many ways. reply runako 2 hours agorootparentYou're addressing a lot more than I even attempted to address.

I also the pond Apple swims in (big tech) is so disgusting and polluted that even their minor effort at cleanliness seems pretty good. reply pgalvin 5 hours agorootparentApple has a lot of technical solutions that mean data is collected, but is never associated with a particular user. As an example, location data is shared with Apple, but it’s associated with a random unique identifier rather than your account. When your trip ends, your device switches to a new identifier. Traffic information is only shared if a certain threshold of users travel on a route [1]. Other examples include the entirely on-device photo scanning, the same rotating identifier system for transcripts of Siri interactions, etc. and, of course, being the only major cloud provider to offer E2EE on everything. Not perfect, but a huge difference from their competitors. [1] https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Location_Services_White_P... reply freedomben 3 hours agorootparentI do appreciate their sharing that, but I hate that it requires entirely just trusting them. They've so locked the user out of the device that it's difficult or impossible to verify anything for yourself, and even if you did, they could trivially push a change at any time because they have ultimate control over the device. On the flip side, I tend to think a company so large would have at least one whistleblower or something on the inside, and/or would be so concerned about legal fallout that they wouldn't risk it. On the flip side of the flip side, Apple is notoriously secretive (even among insiders) and very tight-fisted around employees sharing/leaking information. They also have some of the best lawyers in the world and a near infinite ability to fund any legal action, so may feel (and in fact, be) untouchable. And should Apple go evil, there aren't really great alternatives anyway for the average person, and they're generally so invested in the walled garden that walking away would entail a major disruption to their life. I agree though, while not perfect, they are certainly much better than their competitors (not counting small players, e.g. GrapheneOS), and I'm grateful that at least they keep privacy at the forefront of conversation. If they abandoned it, there'd be nobody to pick up the mantle. reply gunapologist99 3 hours agorootparentprevYou are implying that E2EE is \"on everything\" without mentioning that it's very far from being the default. reply sksksk 10 hours agorootparentprevAllegedly, Apple have built in privacy features so they can't associate individual users with routes, or know what the entire route is[1]. Apple does show traffic data in the app, so they obviously do collect the data somehow. When Apple built maps, the car project was still alive, so it would have been a factor in deciding on the investment. They could still partner with a car manufacturer and use the data. I do suspect that my first point was key in green lighting Apple Maps. Google could have asked for more and more money to provide maps for Apple, or they could pull out completely, and force users to use the App Store app, which would have left the product direction of Maps completely out of Apple's hands.

Maybe they even tried asking Apple for a lot of money to be able to use it on iOS. It takes years, even a decade to get maps to a good quality (Apple maps launched in 2012). So I think it's a good thing that Apple started early enough. I'm sure it's crazy expensive to build and maintain. Apple can fund it from iPhone sales, and ensure that their ecosystem has an alternative for Google maps.

The iPhone launched with Google Maps. Then Google decided to push feature updates skewed towards android phones, leaving iPhone users behind. Apple saw that a vendor could screw their users over (and potentially cause defectors), and decided to invest to ensure they don't have a dependancy. The best part is that they can now offer it to App Store developers as a free iOS SDK (and paid API on web). Meanwhile the same developers would have to pay an exorbitant cost to use Google Maps. It's part of the moat that makes iOS the more profitable platform to develop for. You can also see this playbook with the release of free Weather APIs. Yea Apple/Google maps has to be expensive to build and maintain, but at least for apple, they were able to buy their way to bootstrapping the map. What's impressed me is all the fly-over and custom 3D modeling they've done. It does really feel like they just wanted to make a good map at some point, even beyond what people needed or expected. That said, mapping products probably has good caching and fault tolerance you can design in to reduce cost - maps don't go out of sync that fast (for caching) and you'd never know if their \"suggested routes\" data was out of date occasionally, because you can never drive both routes at once. reply kalleboo 10 hours agorootparentAt the time, Google Maps on iOS was written by Apple, not Google, and Google was holding back API access for Street View until Apple sent back more location/tracking/demographic data on users that Google wanted.

You can't click anywhere on the map to get directions, you have to either click a location (already identified as such, with a name and icon) or type in an address. It's unclear that said locations are even clickable because the mouse icon doesn't change to a pointer.

Apple Maps launched in 2012. That's 12 years that Apple has been plugging away at this. I think we've seen just how much effort is required to catch up to Google Maps. Google actually does a ton to clean up and integrate data from different sources. It adds up. Apple sticks with things they start for the most part (Ping anyone?). Apple Pay is the poster child for this. Every week there's an announcement where some bank in Estonia has been added. They've slowly built out an ecosystem. That's what I mean by autism. Google OTOH has ADHD. If something doesn't immediately work, they lose interest and it gets cancelled. They've reached a point where doing anything requires commitment. Most of Google's successful products are acquisitions. Android, Maps, Docs, Youtube are obvious examples. Exceptions include search (obviously), Chrome and Gmail. There are areas where it's almost a joke how many variants of a product have existed and been shuttered over the years. Payments and messaging springs to mind. Apparently Apple has decided that Maps is core to their business and they've stuck to it. I don't disagree. Good for them. Still, not supporting Firefox?

    "originBody": "Home ➞ Writing Dungeons & Dragons taught me how to write alt text I played a lot of the pen-and-paper roleplaying game in high school and college. I’m now conceptually more into Dungeon World’s approach, but I digress. Unlike Tom Hanks, I avoided turning into a delusional murderer. Instead, I deepened some friendships, had a lot of big laughs, learned some cool vocabulary, and had an indirect introduction to systems design. Importantly, I also annoyed the hell out of my high school principal. If you are not familiar with Dungeons & Dragons, there are two general flavors for how to play: Using miniatures and a map, or Theater of the mind. We elected for theater of the mind more often than not. This was mostly because the rule books by themselves were expensive enough, and my friends and I were lower middle class. Theater of the mind play means that the entire game is conducted verbally. The sole exception is your character sheet, which is a text and number-based armature you build the rest of your character from. The narrative is shared amongst everyone by talking. The aesthetics of the game exist entirely in each player’s mind, and not communicated via moving little figures around on a map. You can probably guess where this post is going now. Thank you, random Dragon Magazine issue Because I cannot half-ass anything, I went hard on immersing myself in the culture surrounding Dungeons and Dragons. This included subscribing to Dragon magazine. I don’t remember the issue number, or the original author. However, I do remember it was from an advice column. The problem was the person who was running the game wanting to enliven his descriptions, as they felt like their narration was both boring and confusing. The advice for that problem was spectacular, and it boiled down to describing the most important thing first. Consider: A large room with rough stone walls. Brownish moss clings to the walls, and trickles of brackish water also flow down parts of it. Broken furniture is scattered across on the floor. The ceiling is so high that you cannot see it. Also, there is a large red dragon attacking you. I don’t know about you, but I’d want to know about the red dragon’s presence and activity a lot more than the quality of the masonry. There’s also another odd bit of putting too much detail on the wrong thing. Let’s rephrase it: A huge dragon the color of a smoldering coal is attacking you! It is rearing its snake-like neck up to strike, head poised underneath a ceiling that is so high you cannot see it. Its dull black, iron-like claws dig into the floor of the rough stone room as it prepares to lunge at you. Broken furniture is scattered about, no doubt victims of previous altercations. We’ve put the most important thing first. We then supply detail in an order that aids in understanding the main point, and discard information that is irrelevant to the overall concept we’re trying to communicate and mood we’re trying to evoke. We now know: There’s a big dragon, and it’s seriously pissed off, There’s ample room for it to move around, It can, and has previously made good on its threats, and that There’s not a lot of places to take cover. This is explicit prioritization of information. It also demonstrates that informative information can also be entertaining. Context, context, context Observant readers may also note I’ve added some emotion with the exclamation point, as well as adding some more flowery language into the mix. Alternative text descriptions (alt text) are as much an art as much as they are a science. A red dragon attack is a significant event, so additional detail and emotion helps. I feel confident in both editorializing the experience as well as punching it up, given that the larger goal is to communicate a frenetic, action-packed encounter. The same also applies in reverse. Smaller, more succinct descriptions can be equally helpful in situations where the content is not a major contributor of the overall thing you’re trying to communicate. In Dungeons & Dragons this is a bit of an in-joke. Over-describing something trivial can lead to your players fixating on it, completely derailing the plot as they try and uncover the secrets behind something mundane that you had no pre-formulated plans for. This is why you want to go with this: A worn, wooden mug full of cheap ale. Over this: A stout mug crafted from reclaimed lumber. It is poorly stained and worn smooth from years of heavy use. Twin iron bands are placed at the top and bottom, equally as worn and giving it a comfortable heft. A thin, frothy ale has been poured into it, smelling weakly of hops and strongly of alcohol. A single rivulet of ale pours down the side of the mug to stain the bar top the mug is placed on. I mean, it’s a great description, but also not the point. The point is you’re in a seedy pub chasing down rumors about a goblin who somehow got its grubby little hands on a powerful magic artifact. For alt text, we want to also consider the larger context of what you’re trying to communicate, why, and if the detail you provide helps that effort to communicate. Consider the difference between a small badge that indicates a product has been recently-added to the storefront: New! And this Tweet from NASA showcasing a photo from the James Webb telescope: A dramatic blade made of red gaseous wisps comes down top-to-bottom in the center of the image as smaller green wisps feather out in horizontal directions. A bright star shrouded in blue light is near the center of the bow-like blade. Blue dots in different sizes dot the background of the image, signifying neighboring stars.⁣ Tone and mood These two concepts are the bread and butter of a roleplaying game experience. Consider: The vizier prattles on, clearly in love with the sound of their own voice. Meanwhile, the rest of the court slumps—bored, exasperated, and succumbing to the stifling heat of the high summer. They are taking their cue from the sultan, some nakedly jealous of the cushioned throne he is slowly nodding off on. In the desperation of scanning the room to find something more interesting to look at, you catch the unblinking gaze of the court jester. His stare makes you feel like a butterfly pinned to a specimen spreading board. The room begins to slowly fade to black as you continue to lock eyes. A subtle foxfire aura begins to shimmer around his frame, while a placeless humming sound gets louder and louder. The heat of the room is forgotten as a chill runs down your spine. Or: A white woman with short blue hair smirks at the camera and raises a glass to it. Her drink is a margarita, and the glass is beaded with sweat from the heat of the day. She is wearing a loose white shirt, and oversized red sunglasses are perched perfectly on her head. Her hair is slightly frizzy from the humidity, but her expression clearly communicates that she is unbothered by it. It is the golden hour, and the sun casts a warm, hazy amber glow on her skin. The table she is sitting at is wooden and well-worn. Behind her is a busy street, a blur of people going about their day. Both of these descriptions are evocative. As the author of both experiences I am trying to not only: Describe what is physically present, but also How all the qualities add up as a suggestion for how to feel when taken in as a composite whole. For the roleplaying game description, I am injecting an immediate sense of fear and menace into an otherwise boring situation. For the image description, I am I am creating a sense of relaxation and contentment. Additionally, the introduction of the vizier may seem contradictory when compared to the dragon on a first read through. Remember that this is an editorialized experience. The most important thing in this scene is the feelings of shock and fear when something unexpected and unsettling interrupts the mundane. In order to create that feeling, we need to first establish the humdrum experience of an boring, endless meeting in a stifling room. The user experience of assistive technology Another reason why I advocate for describing the most important thing first is because of how screen readers announce alt text. A screen reader will read it in a linear order, starting from the first word in the string and ending with the last. Unlike other web content, there isn’t really any other special way screen readers can work with alt text strings—short of increasing or decreasing the speaking rate. This is also why things like bolding, italicizing, links, and paragraphs aren’t allowed. Another important thing to know about screen readers is that they have dedicated keyboard commands to make them pause or stop announcing. There are a few use cases for this behavior, but the most common one is, “Yup, I got it. Shut up now.” Placing helpful, but ultimately non-critical information after the most important thing lets the person using the screen reader decide when they know enough to get what they need. It also saves them from wasting time re-listening to superfluous information if re-navigating to the image to glean some important detail (“Oh, what was the subject of that painting again?”). Remember, you control the narrative The person who runs the game of Dungeons & Dragons has a responsibility to provide an entertaining and memorable experience for the other participants. You wield power as the person enabling and facilitating the experiences others have. This applies to roleplaying games as well as writing alt text. This is why I believe most contemporary images on the web are not decorative. It’s also why I think it’s important to include details like race, gender, and ethnicity. It is important to acknowledge this fact. For roleplaying games, it centers around consent. For alt text, it centers around autonomy. We want to ensure that people who cannot see the image have the capability to understand it the same way as someone who can. There is a huge amount of power in this act. Skills you can cultivate A decent amount of people are uncomfortable the first time they play a roleplaying game. Acting out a character in front of others can feel strange at first, but is also a feeling that passes the more you do it. The same applies for writing alt text. The more often you practice it, the better you get at it. The grim reality is the state of alt text on the web leaves a lot to be desired. That said, writing it can be a joy and an art.

In our childhood, he was renowned in the neighborhood as a dungeon master. He rode the theater of the mind as far is it would take him.

I just want the interview, I understand that the actor is living somewhere and wearing something, it does not matter. reply vonnik 1 minute agorootparentThat's true. The interesting thing is how D&D creates branching trees of inverted periods, scene by scene and character by character. In great fiction, IMO, there's usually something big that you are not certain of yet that makes it propulsive. Sometimes it's \"which hard choice will the character make in a given scene?\" D&D offloads that decision to the players. With journalism and I guess alt text, you have one big inverted pyramid, and then a recipe for sentence structure that attempts to pack all the relevant facts in for each node. It's actually trying to front-load how it eliminates the unknowns. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws reply orojackson 3 hours agorootparentprev> This structure is why I don't like those ridiculous interviews where it starts with \"the actor sits in his home with [long description of furniture], wearing [long description of clothes], he sips coffee from a [long description of mug]\". I just want the interview, I understand that the actor is living somewhere and wearing something, it does not matter. While I agree with you that I find this style of writing commonly found in the entertainment section of a weekend piece to be very grating, I would argue that this still follows the bottom line up front. For the audience that these pieces are geared towards, the important part is whether the actor passes the vibe check or not. The latter part of the interview itself is not too important because it is mainly promoting whatever the actor wants to promote in the piece. For instance, \"the actor sits in his home with [long description of furniture]\" describes how they keep their home's interior stylistically. What the actor wears shows how good their fashion sense is. Sipping coffee from a fancy mug shows how wealthy they are and/or shows the morning vibe they would exude on a good day. reply sharkjacobs 21 minutes agorootparentprevWhy are you reading a lifestyle interview withif you don't care about their life and how they live? What content in this interview do you care about? reply hinnisdael 20 hours agoprevGreat advice: describing things in order of importance. Most people intuitively describe images from foreground to background or left to right, a bit like they are mentally completing a checklist of all the things to describe. As correctly noted by the author, describing by importance first has the added benefit of allowing screen reader users to skip irrelevant/uninteresting images early. Compare: Torn-up painting in a gallery, observers standing in front of the work. vs. Gallery interior, people standing in front of a painting with visible damage. reply the_other 10 hours agoparent> Most people intuitively describe images from foreground to background or left to right I've heard there are cultural biases to this ordering. Some cultures tend to describe the background or scene first. The example I read about identified Japan as an \"outside in\".

If you don't get to the point quickly, people might think it doesn't really apply/matter to them and ignore it. This became very obvious to me when my day job for a few years was responding to customer service requests over email for World of Warcraft. I would often find myself skimming all the useless (quite literally) pretext as quickly as possible scanning for what their actual problem was. Stereotypical example of a poor email from a customer: > Last night I finished the raid with my guild where we downed the Lich King. Then this morning I went to school where my friends and I also talked about WoW, then when I got home, everything seemed normal, I turned on my computer, logged on and entered my password, but it didn't work, then I went to the website and used the password reset, then I tried to log on and it said my account was locked, then I checked my email, and it said my account is locked and I need to contact Blizzard... At which point I stop reading and I'm thinking \"finally, I see why he's emailing us\". To be fair, these emails are often from adolescents who understandingly do not yet have the experience to do effective communication (which is actually an additional interesting aspect of customer service for a computer game compared to services which are only taken up by adults, but I digress).

His point was that technical people tend to want to produce an argument with all the information etc and then get to the conclusion.

I agree that more information is sometimes better, but elaborate only after stating the core issue. For example, if you're emailing a provider about being overbilled. Start your email with \"I'm writing to you because I have been overbilled and would please like this addressed\", then you lay out your case with all the facts that you think could be relevant.

As \"random\" reach outs by a supplier are not always appreciated, we always try to offer something of value/relevance when doing so, with the first sentence being something like \"Hi , We've recently done , I was wanting to check if this would be useful to you?\". I can then perhaps elaborate further on the potentially useful thing to them and also close by stating that I would be happy to do a video call to go through it in more detail if they would like. What's particularly noteworthy here is that I did a \"call to action\" which would be low effort on their part, namely to \"please at least reply to let me know if this is useful\" in the very first sentence. This is actually a bit of a psychological trick where because the recipient has been directly asked to do something in particular, they're more likely to continue reading towards doing this and engage. Once we started it on our side, I also started to notice that I see this trick very often to my own inbox from completely cold contact direct marketers, their first sentence often ends with something to the effect of \"wouldwork for you for us to discuss further?\", I don't engage with these completely cold contacts, but I see exactly what they're trying to do. reply kelseyfrog 21 hours agoprevRelated, but for me it was Dwarf Fortress.

Dungeon World is designed to focus on creativity and shared storytelling with simpler mechanics to make the game more fluid. However, there's nothing simpler than having a clear D&D rule for something like fall damage, instead of having the party debate if a player survived the fall. Dungeon World doesn't have fall damage calculator and instead relies in the narrative, presumably from the pre-written story or DM. reply ipsi 20 hours agoparentMost people who prefer DW would say that D&D sometimes has clear rules for something, but often has no rules, boring rules, or rules that aren't necessarily \"fun\". Combat, while tactical, tends to be slow and can frequently consume a lot of time in a session, plus the majority of rules and character powers are focused on combat. If you're playing sessions with a lot of RP, DW will have a much better balance of rules:session-time, it's much easier to prep for, and given how rules-lite D&D really is outside combat, will probably have about the same amount of narrative input. Note that it's not necessarily the \"group debating if the player survived\", but typically the GM giving the player a choice when they fail to climb the wall, like \"you fall and take a little damage, or you slip a little, cursing loudly and alerting the enemies at the top to you\". Done well, it gives the players a lot more agency, and much better buy-in for the story as they're now shaping it, instead of just being along for the ride. I would also say that pre-written narratives aren't really a thing for DW (at least, as far as I know!), so it's really down to what the DM sees as an appropriate penalty or choice, often phrased as \"you succeed, but \". It's not really better or worse than D&D overall, I'd just say that it's much better suited for certain play-styles. If you enjoy tactical gameplay and using miniatures, then D&D (or maybe Pathfinder) are much better options. If the thought of yet another fight makes you want to gouge your eyes out, I'd recommend giving DW a try. reply sdenton4 19 hours agorootparentThe player choices and handling of partial success in PBtA games (like dungeon world) really makes them sing.

I don't know much about DW in particular, other than it's an early PBTA hack and not generally considered one of the better examples of the system anymore, but it still has a lot of fans. However, these games share a lot in common, usually including a focus on Moves. The GM determines if something is a Move or not. If it's a move the player gets to roll for it, and if it's not a Move, it just happens. Moves tend to cover very broad areas of actions and are lot less specific and nitpicky than D&D rules. Unlike D&D, the GM also has Moves. These moves are usually tailored to the particular PBTA game and generally include various ways to keep pressure on the players in a way that fits the theme and setting and mood of the particular game. It codifies the GM's job in a way that makes it more approachable for many. D&D is among the most difficult systems to GM and it leads to a shortage of people wanting to GM vs those wanting to play. Experienced DMs over many years learn to be a little looser and how to wing things and improvise and make the jobs easier for themselves. PBTA games are designed to teach the GM how to do this from the start, partly by teaching the players that this is expected and correct. reply artimaeis 4 hours agorootparentCan you recommend some of the better examples of the system these days?

I can barely get my D&D 5e group to play D&D 5e (it's fizzled out completely now) let alone an alternate RPG so I joined a Play-by-Post game of Starforged that was just starting up. You can play it solo or co-op or guided (i.e. with a GM). We're playing it co-op and we're playing 4 player even though the game recommends 1 to 3 players. So we all have to be creative and figure out the rules together (we're also on the starforged discord where we can participate in discussion about the rules and ways to interpret them), as well as implement the best practices of play-by-post but we seem to be meshing very well so far. One catch is you need more than the core rulebook. You'll need the asset cards, which you can download and print but it's easier to just buy the cards. (edit: or you can just copy the images of the specific cards you pick for your character into its own document instead.) And the reference book which is spiral bound so it can lay flat might be useful, although lately I've just been looking up each move in the index of the main rulebook instead.

As an aside, even rules light games I play has a rule for fall damage. But even DnD 5e doesn't have rules for falling onto softer surfaces. What if you fall on 10 foot thick foam? What about 1 inch thick foam? Into a bush? What if I use create food to create a pool of bread at the bottom of a cliff we're climbing so if someone falls they take less damage? Do we need fall damage rules for everything players could fall on? Are you going to tell a player that falling on a stone floor is the same damage as falling on a 10 foot thick piece of foam?

It kinda opens your mind to what is great about d&d (for me their well defined settings and a lot of expansiveness of their class subclass system.. that and a ton of nostalgia, I played my first game of redbox in the 80s) and where it lacks. It's kind of the middle of the road game, it does a lot of stuff reasonably well but some of these other games specialize the gameplay in some very interesting ways.

I don't think anyone's suggesting having the party debate things. D&D has a bunch of precise mechanical rules for combat, and very few for anything else. This makes sense for a game about simulating small-squad combat (which is what D&D started life as), but it's not really what you want for a game about narrative and roleplay. It means combat tends to take up a disproportionate amount of playtime in D&D (because you have all these mechanical rules, and the multiple-round system), when the combat actually isn't such a big part of the narrative or the fun; I've found that most successful/fun D&D groups tend to skip the fiddlier rules (e.g. how many people actually bother with full encumbrance calculations?) and even handwave away entire combats (\"you kill the goblins, don't bother rolling\"). Think about how you handle conflicts in non-combat parts of the game. If you're trying to persuade the King to overrule the evil chancellor or whatever, how do you do that? You certainly don't have n rounds of following precise calculations and looking up tables about each step of persuasion. Generally you either have narrative steps towards your goal (you break into the chancellor's vaults to collect the papers that prove he's been embezzling, you bribe a reporter to frame him in a compromising position, ...), and/or the GM decides whether your ideas were clever enough to succeed, or maybe the GM assigns a difficulty (modified by the previous two points) and then you do one roll. In my experience even people who like D&D tend to enjoy sessions where they're doing stuff like that more than doing a series of combats (except for the occasional powergamer type who really does just want to kill as many orcs as possible for 90 minutes - but if you're after \"creativity and shared storytelling\" then you're presumably not that kind of gamer); often when people look back on a campaign their favourite session was one with no (or very few) combats but one where interesting character moments or story developments happened. (And conversely, more than once I've had a fun session where we were all doing some great roleplay, riffing off each other, and then we hit a big combat and everything just ground to a halt as we had to dig out dice and tables and stop the story for half an hour while we did a bunch of mechanics) So what if you handled combat the way you handle other conflicts? The GM takes narrative reasons why one side should win or lose, gives the players points for creativity if they come up with a good idea, then comes up with a difficulty and you make one roll. Or maybe you do several rounds of that, but based on the narrative flow of the combat, not just crunching numbers. In my experience that makes for a much more fun, interesting game. (I actually enjoy, like, Mordenheim or Kill Team, which is the kind of game that D&D originally was. But that's as a competitive game first and roleplaying second. Detailed mechanical simulation makes sense when you're competing about who's better at combat.

That way someone can stop reading at any point and still have a complete view at some level of detail. reply bux93 10 hours agorootparentSome people find that determining what the conclusion is, is difficult to begin with. Or that there are many conclusions. And, how do you present those details? Chronologically? A helpful techniques I've picked up (that some people absolutely hate); write down the individual statements on post-it notes. That way you can reshuffle. What would the story look like if A is 'the conclusion'? What if we start off with B? What does it look like if we present the supporting evidence chronologically? What if we present it in a more layered way? (\"the colonel couldn't have done it, as on the day of the murder, he was in another city\") Another tip is for the introduction, the lead up to the conclusion; start with listing the facts that are common knowledge, then the fact that raised the question to be answered; then you reach the conclusion. (E.g. Every week, grandma bakes a pie and leaves it to cool in the window. Last week was no exception. But when she went to retrieve the pie, it was half-eaten! The culprit was the cat!) This setting the scene can give the reader some context. In a real-world example, the known facts might include your company's strategy or objectives, underscoring why people should care about your advice. reply jyunwai 16 hours agorootparentprevThis approach is also known as the \"Minto Pyramid.\" The website \"Untools\" has a well-written webpage that explains this: https://untools.co/minto-pyramid/ Untools itself also inspired some good discussions on this forum (2020, 137 comments): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23339830 reply dallas 16 hours agorootparentNice link, thanks!

These can provide exemplars for how to approach your own writing. Consider a recent article in the Financial Times about rising sea temperatures [1][2]. The topic is vast and complicated, which is perhaps relatable to your perspective, yet it's the job of the writer to produce the linear narrative that you mentioned. How does the writer do this? --- The article presents the key idea up front with a headline (\"The dangerous effects of rising sea temperatures\"), and then adds context with a sub-headline (\"Scientists are increasingly concerned that the world’s oceans are approaching the limits of their capacity to absorb heat\"). To ease the reader into the topic, the author then begins by focusing on a human subject by writing: \"In 30 years of studying the oceans, Matthew England has learnt to understand their irregular yet constant rhythms — the cycles of wind, temperature and atmospheric changes that interact with the masses of water covering most of the Earth’s surface. The author continues: \"But what he has seen in the past 15 months has shocked him. Global sea surface temperatures have reached and stayed at record levels, fuelling heatwaves and melting sea ice. Temperatures in the north Atlantic waters he has been studying, including around the UK and Ireland, were described last year as “beyond extreme” by the EU’s Earth observation service.\" The author later \"zooms out\" as a narrative technique—similar to the one described in the submitted article—that provides wider context for the problem that the interviewee is describing by presenting cases of natural disasters. To get deeper into the subject, the author then includes perspectives from various other researchers who study the phenomenon, and then dives deeper into competing theories about the immediate causes behind these environmental changes. --- So, in your context, you could begin describing how your software tool solves some problem by describing a human user who is facing a specific yet common issue that is frustrating. After the reader then grasps what the problem is, you could write about how your software tool fixes the problem. But this is just one approach of many. Another author might have taken a \"lede-nut graf\" [3] approach, where the bottom-line conclusion is put in the first sentence as the \"lede,\" followed by the \"nut graf\" of a paragraph providing additional context and motivation to read the rest of the article. With this approach, you could skip the focus on a human user, and instead jump right into a sentence that claims your software tool solves a specific problem (especially if the problem is a well-known one). One of the best methods I've found to get better at a particular skill is to immerse yourself in high-quality exemplars of what you're trying to do. Even without taking notes, you can naturally pick up lessons from what you're experiencing. For this reason, a habit of reading well-written articles could help with your own ability to describe complicated concepts in a way that's more accessible.

Every possible semi-important NPC with a biography and set of motivations and stats for every place they might go in the whole campaign? Yeah, shitloads of work, hundreds of hours, maybe thousands. Or you can have a basic setting and a little town with some adventure hooks, a few partially fleshed out items and NPCs, a few more randomly-generated ones for roles like “shop keeper” or “bar patron” when you don’t have anything better, crib some other setting’s gods and politics and what have you, and only fill more stuff in if the players take an interest.

    "originBody": "law / tech CrowdStrike will be liable for damages in France, based on the OVH precedent 25 July 202425 July 2024 thehftguyLeave a comment Hello, Today I am doing a quick post to cover the recent CrowdStrike incident that is estimated to have disabled 8.5M computers and caused more than $5.4B in damages since last week. Now a common questions is whether CrowdStrike will be liable for damages? The answer is most certainly yes. There is actually a very similar case that was brought to court a few years ago regarding the OVH incident, in France. While it applies to France, which is the jurisdiction I am the most familiar with, the same principles will apply to many other jurisdictions. One quick note to clear a common misconception before we begin. Most contracts have boilerplate terms to waive liability, there is a common misconception that they may waive liability, however they do not. These terms have no meaning in most jurisdiction outside of the US and either way, it’s not possible to waive liability in most circumstances (e.g. anything involving gross negligence, criminal activities or going against the law itself). About OVH OVH is a French datacenter and cloud provider, allegedly the largest hosting provider in Europe. They are most known for providing physical servers and virtual machines, as well as a variety of cloud services. A fire broke out on 10th March 2021 in their SGB location. It burned down two datacenters SGB1 SGB2 with little or no recovery and rendered two more datacenters SGB3 SGB4 inoperable for a while. What is interesting is the aftermath. Multiple sites were destroyed causing irrecoverable loss of service and loss of data to their customers. Multiple customers pursued them in court for damages and they won. I found there were a few interesting points raised and discussed by the court: (Skipping the elements about the fire itself, to focus on the service and tech) There was complete loss of service during and after the event There was complete irrecoverable loss of data after the event OVH provided a backup service for their machines and services There was complete irrevocable loss of the backups after the event There were multiple datacenters in nearby locations, as is standard practice to provide some resiliency: SGB1 SGB2 SGB3 SGB4 Multiple datacenters burned down at once. The multiple datacenters were in fact in the same place, a few steps apart. That was considered unexpected and not reasonable by the court. The backups were stored in the same datacenter or in the other datacenter that might happen to be in the same place. That was not considered reasonable by the court. OVH tried to argue that customers should have followed good practice of having multiple backups in separate locations. The court acknowledged it was the good practice. The court determined OVH was the backup provider, the court determined it was the role of OVH to provide backups to a reasonable standard and observe good practices. This includes storing a copy of the backup elsewhere as is good practice. The court ruled the OVH backup service was not operated to a reasonable standard and failed at its purpose. I find it interesting for techies, the court will judge your tech and what can really be considered best practices. It’s like the ultimate code review 😀 To summarize how things work: harm done + intent to cause harm or negligence = potential for damages There is significant harm caused to customers, as entire businesses were shutdown, often indefinitely with complete data loss and no possibility to recover. There are multiple occurrences of negligence, mistakes or questionable practices in how OVH was operating the service, which lead to the issue. It’s a solid case. There are multiple customers who opened a case against OVH and won. There may be more still being processed. That brings us to CrowdStrike. The similarities are striking! About CrowdStrike CrowdStrike is an anti-virus software that is installed on computers. It’s sometimes called an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) these days. It’s mostly installed on corporate devices in large companies, as they are required to have a security solution. CrowdStrike runs on startup of the computer. It is deeply embedding itself into the operating system (Windows or Linux) at a kernel level, to run as soon as possible and before other things start. It monitors what runs, it can block and report anything that it deems suspicious. On 19th July 2019, CrowdStrike pushed an update to their software. The update was bugged and crashed any computer it was deployed on. Millions of computers simultaneously received the update across the world and were rendered non functional. I think there are multiple interesting points to raise and discuss: CrowdStrike runs at startup in a highly privileged mode (kernel driver on Windows) and it starts first. It can prevent any other software and prevent the system itself from running, whether intentionally to block a threat or accidentally due to a bug or misjudging a non-threat. It is deployed to millions of corporate devices in industries like banks, travel, supermarket, etc… it is largely targeted to critical industries and critical devices with confidential information. It is a highly critical application operating in sensitive environments, which requires extra care to develop and to test. On the day of the incident, CrowdStrike pushed the updates to millions of critical devices at once Good practice requires to stage software upgrades. How was it possible for CrowdStrike to ship a (broken) update to millions of devices in the span of minutes? Was there no testing and no staged rollout? From discussion online, customers in hospitals have complained about this issue before and requested for CrowdStrike to allow some control on updates. One customers reported they were rejected with a 50 pages memo from CrowdStrike saying they refuse to stage anything. Does CrowdStrike not have any ability to stage a rollout? They have repeatedly alluded that they did not and/or refused to. That may be in breach of regulated industries they sell to. CrowdStrike is expected to be heavily tested to not disrupt the (critical) devices it is deployed to. The update crashed any computer it was deployed to (BSOD). How was it possible for an ostensibly broken update to not be detected before it was pushed to the outside world? Does CrowdStrike do any testing whatsoever? Obviously they didn’t or the incident wouldn’t have happened. It is not an isolated incident. The same thing happened few weeks earlier with the CrowdStrike agent on Linux, nuking the system and there may be other occurrences before. After the bad update was pushed, it took nearly two hours for CrowdStrike to realize there was a problem and stop the update. Developers working on critical software are required to monitor a deployment after deploying, to verify it’s working as expected and not causing issues. What was CrowdStrike doing after deploying? Were they monitoring the deployment? Could they not notice that the update destroyed every machine it was deployed to? All computers were rendered inoperable by CrowdStrike, unable to boot. For affected companies, that left all their employees with a dead computer, unable to do anything. It wasn’t possible for users to “access” the computer to raise a ticket or troubleshoot it. It was a complete loss of service with no way to recover. One way to fix the computer was for the IT team to be given the computer and completely reinstall (reimage) it. Another way that was found later in the day, was for an administrator to access the computer physically AND try to boot in safe mode or recovery mode then delete the driver file for CrowdStrike. This remediation can only be done with physical access to the affected computer AND by an administrator who has a special password (or USB key with the password) to start a laptop into recovery mode. It will take weeks for affected companies to physically get a hand on every device, user laptop, desktop and server. It can be thousands to hundreds of thousands of devices to get to. It will take longer for devices that are enclosed or difficult to access, like screen terminals in an airport, medical devices and machinery in a hospital, elevator panels. It may be impossible to restore the device if the device is locked down somehow (physically blocked or recovery password unknown). Employees who require a computer to work are unable to work during all that time. It is not possible to provide a spare computer to affected users, the spares were affected by the issue too. Crowstrike is a security software that was meant to keep computers running and protected from threats. CrowdStrike destroyed the computers it was supposed to protect, it failed at its purpose. There is significant harm caused to customers. Businesses were partially or completely shutdown, for days or weeks. There are multiple occurrences of negligence, mistakes and questionable practices in how CrowdStrike was operating the service, which lead to the issue. The issue was not an isolated incident, as people have reported the same thing happened just few weeks before on a lesser scale. That should leave CrowdStrike liable wide open to countless claims for damages. Customers operating in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, aerospace, transportation, are actually required to test and stage and track changes. CrowdStrike claims to have a dozen certifications and standards which require them to follow particular development practices and carry out various level of testing, but they clearly did not. The simple fact that CrowdStrike does not do any of that and actively refuses to, puts them in breach of compliance, which puts customers themselves in breach of compliance by using CrowdStrike. All together, there may be sufficient grounds to unilaterally terminate any CrowdStrike contracts for any customer who wishes to. Appendix As additional evidence, we can quote an employee working for BitLocker discussing their testing and rolling methodology. BitLocker is a tool to securely encrypt the disk on your computer. It will prevent anybody else from reading any data if the computer is lost or stolen. It’s similarly critical. It’s the first thing to run on startup and nothing can run without it (no data can be loaded from disk). Any mistake or bug in BitLocker would render the computer unable to operate and render all data on it unreadable (full irrecoverable data loss, exactly like the OVH incident). They have many layers of testing, starting with testing on their own computer then their own team then other teams. Do CrowdStrike employees even have CrowdStrike running on their machine? As additional evidence, we can quote another employee working for a non identified company, who claims their company was hit by a previous CrowdStrike issue, they formally requested for CrowdStrike to allow staged rollout, CrowdStrike refused and sent back a 50 pages memo categorically refusing the idea. If that is true, this memo may now constitute critical evidence against CrowdStrike.

We lived the OVH incident live and saw the whole aftermath. OVH was held liable because of the data loss, not for the service interruption. Data loss is something irremediable, permanent, definitive. Some businesses were basically ruined from this incident because they had no more data to operate. To add insult to injury, they sold offsite backups in the datacenter literally meters away. A service interruption, well, shit happens, and this is handled by SLA contracts that both parties agree to. You don't ruin a business (read: close a company) for a few days of outage. I doubt CrowdStrike will be held liable for much; from corporations at least. They cannot repay the damage done, or they close the door.

But this only creates excuses for all other responsible players in this systemic issue - or society at large. Just to pick 1 example: I keep reading comments on how profoundly health care providers were affected and that lead to human life losses. I understand that having \"tech\" involved in health or any sector is important but are we really wanting to build critical services that grind to halt or have huge efficiency impact when a single vendor fails? Are these service providers not responsible for thinking about failure modes? reply HappySweeney 2 hours agorootparentI read that healthcare was mollified by a facility whereby they could choose when and which updates to allow, which CS intentionally bypassed with this latest update. This was during the chaotic day-of though, so possibly false. reply jb3689 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't understand why there is so much attention on the deployment and testing side of the coin. Yes, better testing and rollout strategy should have prevented this specific occurrence of a failure. But these strategies aren't bulletproof and things go wrong. You need defense in depth, and some responsibility has to lay on the consumer side for that to happen - particularly for fundamental humane industries like transportation and healthcare. These industries should not be allowed to run any software like this - privileged and without controlled rollouts.

Honestly, I think this is the right approach, and I'm speaking as a bilingual French/English speaker. Google Maps doesn't know that you are bilingual. So it has two choices: pronounce words the \"right\" (i.e., native) way, or pronounce them the \"English\" way. If someone who is unused to hearing the native pronunciation, their understanding is going to be impeded. Google Maps tells you for example to turn onto Passage du Grand Cerf in a French accent, a non-Francophone is going to have a harder time finding that.

On the old lines, they had what sounded like a native English speaker do the announcements of the upcoming station, including the station name. On the newer ones it sounds like they just recorded the \"we're arriving at\" bit once and then spliced in the read-by-a-Chinese station name, which is much harder to understand as a foreigner.

Even, like, names ... Duplessis or Cartier or whatever... just completely unrecognizable. Or take the way it reads out the exits off the 401 in Toronto, reading the full bilingual sign (where there is one) with the English first and then the French part as if it was a continuation ... in English (\"Sud\" read out like you'd say that if it was an English word, hard D and everything.)

In the OVH case, their backup system (as a whole) failed. Many customers were left with 0 data, and per the article \"the court ruled the OVH backup service was not operated to a reasonable standard and failed at its purpose\". Meanwhile CrowdStrike \"just\" crashed their customer's kernels, for a duration of about 1 hour (during which they were 100% safe from cyber attacks!). Any remaining delays getting systems back online were (in my view) due to customers not having good enough disaster recovery plans. There's certainly grounds to argue that CrowdStrike's software was \"not to a reasonable standard\", but the first-order impacts (a software crash) are of a very different magnitude to permanently losing all data in a literal ball of fire (as in the OVH case). Software crashes all the time. For better or for worse, we treat software bugs as an inevitability in most industries (there are exceptions, of course). While software bugs are the \"fault\" of the software vendor, the job of mitigating the impacts thereof lies with the people deploying it. The only thing that makes the CrowdStrike case newsworthy, compared to all the other software crashes that happen on a daily basis, is that CrowdStrike's many customers had inserted their software into many critical pathways. CrowdStrike sells a playing card, and customers collectively built a house with them. (P.S. Don't treat this as a defense of CrowdStrike. I think their software sucks and was developed sloppily. I think they should face consequences for their sloppiness, I just don't think they will, under current legal frameworks. At best, maybe people will vote with their wallets, going forwards.) reply vesinisa 7 hours agoparent> for a duration of about 1 hour Not even remotely correct. Most computers that were affected by the fault needed physical remediation via safe mode boot to fix the issue because they were not able to download a fix because of being stuck in a reboot loop.

So I think you can considers this quite different from regular crashes because recovery is much more difficult and because it affected a lot of computers simultaneously. On top of that there are companies that had failures of their own in their recovery procedures. But even with good procedures this can be a significant outage because it is not trivially reverted and would typically affect many configurations that are redundant for many other failures. reply Retr0id 7 hours agorootparentIf the uptime of 100% of your computers depends on a single vendor not writing software with bugs in it, you have a problem. reply fabian2k 7 hours agorootparentThat would mean that you always need a fully redundant copy of everything based on entirely different OSes and software with no common component.

I think all they have is AMSI, which is only for scanning PowerShell scripts and such. If you want to hook process execution or file access, you're writing a kernel driver. reply simiones 6 hours agoparentprevFalcon provides many levels of protection (in principle - in practice, given the extreme incompetence demonstrated in this case, I doubt they do much more than sell snake oil), some of which have OS-native alternatives, some of which do not, and most of which Linux definitely doesn't have built-in. For example, the Linux kernel team doesn't have a DB of known malware signatures that the kernel or init system runs or shell runs any new software component against - Falcon does this. Another example - neither Linux nor any common Linux userspace natively integrates with with a fleet management system to check if the current user is allowed to run a particular piece of software. And there are many other similar questions. Finally, even when the OS does natively provide services like these (Enterprise versions of Windows do provide all the features I mentioned above), it's perfectly reasonable to prefer a different vendor for those solutions. Maybe people trust CrowdStrike's malware signature lists more than they do Microsoft's, for example: a good reason to buy CrowdStrike instead of using Windows Defender. I'm not trying to defend CrowdStrike or Windows here. But I think it's obvious that there are many features that fall under the umbrella of security that you wouldn't want to build into the OS itself, and even when a version of them exists built-in, that a company may wish to source from a different vendor. reply sim7c00 7 hours agoparentprevLinux can't be secured out of the box to do anything that Falcon does. If you use AuditD, eBPF and things like GRSecurity patches you might get into a good state, but it's still not the same thing at all. it might be secure depending on your linuxfoo, but it's not the same thing as running EDR which will help correlate system behavior across different systems etc. and look with much more depth into process behaviors and system interactions. Also, you don't want operating systems to provide this actual EDR program. They need to provide the facilities for EDR vendors / creators to tap into and do their work properly. You don't want a butcher to rate their own meat... you want a third-party to do this. As Example: MS Defender is totally rubbish (general sentiment for a lot of people in security, hence they run falcon or cortex XDR etc.) at defending Windows.... and it's by Microsoft. They should focus on building an auditable OS and let auditors do the auditing... The best thing imho is a tool like CSF but integrated with network appliances (which CS doesn't do i think), which is where the strength of such tooling really comes together, correlating network data / behaviors to endpoint behaviours and having a full 'causality chain' of processes / systems and network traffic invovled in an attack. And you are right on the balance of security being dramatic. using crypto is still hard as ever, and allowing external parties to interact with your users is just impossible to do right (let alone have users in the right awareness mode). This last is a problem of security industry imho, making tools so difficult. Someday maybe rather than EDR tools and firewalls, cybersecurity companies will deliver 'secure business services' which are easy to use, userfriendly services that are secure by default. - maybe in like the year 3042. reply tyingq 8 hours agoparentprevWindows does have Defender, which does some amount of tracking signatures and heuristics of various types of malware. It has not, however, proved enough to fend off different real world problems like ransomware. Hence, the market for 3rd party solutions that are more aggressive.

Authors of such are fully aware of Linux hardening like SELinux / AppArmor and work around it. reply amluto 7 hours agorootparent> How do you actively detect a malware agent running in user space using stealth or a kernel. You start with correct design. The system has a root of trust (ideally you skip the insane level of complexity that is Secure Boot + TPM and use something simple, testable, and verifiable — this isn’t actually that hard). Only authorized images will boot, and, more importantly, nothing else on the network trusts the machine until it proves it’s running the right image. Then you make the image immutable. Want to edit a system file? You can’t. Maybe in developer mode you can edit an overlay. All configuration is stored in a designated place, and that configuration is minimized. A stock image from the distro vendor has zero configuration, so there is no incomprehensible soup in /etc to audit. Configuration is also attested. Persistent data is separate from configuration. All persistent data is considered suspect. Any bug that allows malicious persistent data to compromise anything is a blocker, including corrupt filesystem metadata. A root-of-trust attestation has limited lifetime. The system forcibly re-verifies periodically. This either means rebooting or doing a runtime “dynamic root of trust” attenuation. The latter is complex. Complicated messes like kernel “lockdown” and the stock Secure Boot signatures have no place. Usermode root and the kernel are approximately equally trusted. SELinux is barely necessary, if at all, unless the actual user code wants it to control access to persistent data. But there are simpler, better schemes that are easier to reason about. Sadly the industry doesn’t think this way. I’m regularly surprised that Apple hasn’t gone in this direction more aggressively than they are with their MacOS products. reply simiones 5 hours agorootparentYou haven't answered anything interesting. Any software system that anyone cares about operates on state - user documents, a database, other bespoke systems etc. If the operator of that system accidentally deploys malware to it, how to you ensure that this malware doesn't destroy, replace, or exfiltrate this state the the system normally operates on? Malicious code doesn't need to run as root in order to completely destroy a business. Not to mention, all of the things you describe are very nice if the kernel is perfectly secure. But it's not, so it's always possible and even likely that compromising any user on the system is equivalent to compromising root. And if you compromise one system, you can then exploit bugs in other systems' kernels that might allow RCE through well-crafted packets or other exploits that gain access without running through any user-space code that might validate those attestations. And finally, when a vulnerability is found allowing such exploits, you now need to update all of these readonly systems - and this happens at least once a month. Do you go with a USB stick to each of 10k systems on five continents to update them?

I'll strongly disagree on selinux, I have seen it work in practice to defeat attackers many times, that provide features that seccomp and cgroups etc do not. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentre: SELinux, I think it depends on your use case. If your system is a flight information display, then you may well have two userspace processes that do anything of significance: the display manager and the actual app. There is no persistent state. At this point, SELinux is purely overhead and extra attack surface — what would it even protect. If your payload is a container (database server, microservice, whatever), and you’re doing some form of best-practice volume management, then only the database’s own data is mounted for it. SELinux is a real PITA to get working in a context like this, and it’s not really clear what it would add. (Okay, maybe you get fancy and use it to restrict what can talk to the microservice. Or maybe you use network namespaces.) If you’re running a desktop or a more conventional server setup, then, sure, MAC policy has its place. reply ungamedplayer 3 hours agorootparentAbsolutely depends on the use case. I'm attempting to talk in the generic case. If you limit policy to the minimum attack surface from outside the process including permissions and capabilities which are significantly more fine grained in selinux compared to normal Unix permissions, you reduce the the capability of the attacker once they gain access to the system. Imagine if they got access to local code execution... Binding to sctp protocol would instantiate the whole protocol in kernel. Effectively opening up whole new attack vectors. I can't see any other techniques (other than selinux like AC) that enables this kind of attack space reduction as easily. I am aware that you can blacklist modules,etc but this is just one of many examples. reply ongy 2 hours agorootparentYou can use SEccomp for some of it as well. But for SEccomp something in the hierarchy needs to do this actively While SELinux can be set up somewhat orthogonal to the running system. OTOH systemd should make it easy to confirm every service process reply fulafel 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is a much harder problem than prevention, which is what the OS should be doing. reply worthless-trash 7 hours agorootparentprev> How do you actively detect a malware agent running in user space using stealth Depending how advanced the attacker is, check the executing binary maps back to the actual expected name and location on disk. Make sure the executable and libraries used at runtime are the correct ones matching hashes of known good qualities. Ensure the process tree structure has an expected structure, ie \"bash\" isnt starting a process called apache. Make sure the selinux policy is correct for the process that is running. (I have no idea about apparmor) Check to see if its linking to the expected binaries, that its not using 'hidden' files (starting with a dot or directory with a dot), or deleted files. Confirm that the process is opening sockets and files that. you expect it to (ie, apache shouldn't open files that are outside its configuration directive). The process should not be making outgoing socket connections unless it is a client. It should not be running with capabilities(7) that it does not require. It should not be executing from a setuid binary. Check the process name, quite often attackers rename the running executable, so you'll see /proc/pid/cmdline renamed with a bunch of null bytes at the end. Some malware has 'anti debugging' tactics, ie, they have traced themselves to prevent you tracing them, you can find this as one of the lines in /proc/pid/status iirc. There are more, but thats the few off the top of my head. > or a kernel. This is a MUCH harder problem, because attackers can always disable any security mechanism assuming they kernel code execution. However, assuming they are not too focused.. If the system is booting in secureboot mode, it should be enabled, and no extra / unused / out of date kernel modules loaded. I know that code injection at the memory level means that attackers can inject unsigned code, so in this case you would want to periodically sample the code and ensure that execution context would only have the processers EIP in known areas where the kernel would map executable code. You could do an additional check to see if the areas are mapped by userspace processes (it might be too late) so you can find offending attackers. If the host is virtualized, this becomes easier to do and mapping and comparing memory from the guest kernel for the executable code sections means that its harder for an attacker to work around by being able to disable a mechanism. Usually attacker kernel exploits do not persist long temr in kernel space, (they abuse kernel space to allow for userspace privilege escalation ie make a binary setuid or modify permissions on a /dev/) because the longer they are there the more likely they are to panic the system. Some of the more advanced attacks I have seen are from people uploading system kernel panic images, where I have a 'snapshot' of the running system and can work around attackers mitigation techniques. reply zokier 6 hours agorootparent> [...] > There are more, but thats the few off the top of my head.

Autocad should read and write in ~/autocad. Maybe in ~/Downloads? But definitely not in ~/.ssh or ~/.aws. Stock Windows actually implements something along these lines, called \"protected folders\" or similar. It's inactive by default (meaning every program can access every folder). It's quite easy to define a list of \"protected\" folders. But the implementation is quite stupid: if a program asks for access to one of the folders on the list, you can either refuse, or allow it to access it... as well as everything else on that list! reply worthless-trash 7 hours agorootparentprevIf you have good examples, I'd love to see it, A writeup even more so on the techniques they used.

Not as good as Jamf on Mac mind you, but better than than most \"windows ecosystem\". And if you run jamf for policy and detection, but not response, you sort of get it all. So, that's why not \"just defender\" - at 10k+ systems the anti-malware is just the beginning. What do you do when that fails and ...yeh.. anyway.. there is more to it.

Essentially trying to reactively cat-and-mouse hostile software that the OS has let execute on the computer. (2) Why doesn't Windows provide AV? Question (1) is more interesting - and (2) is addressed by other comments. I think both MS and their customers have very seldom prioritized security over even small compromises in functionality. We loudly blame MS but they are the vendor MS customers deserve. While it's not a democracy, there are parallels to the popular sport of blaming politicians for eg not doing hard choices against climate change while holding the voters innocent. reply simiones 6 hours agorootparentThe cat-and-mouse game is between OS security features and hackers. AV software is not a crutch, it's an extra level of defense. All OS kernels are vulnerable to malware - this is a 100% given at this moment in history. The question is how to mitigate this problem, and AV is one component of that, as are firewalls, network-level intrusion prevention systems, and a whole host of other security software. Maybe some day someone will write an OS that is \"fully secure\" and then they'll be able to confidently run a system whose users can confidently click a link in an email, download an .exe from there, and run it, without fear of losing or leaking a single bit of data. That day is definitely not here, and until then, we all do the best we can through education and security appliances. reply cesarb 1 hour agorootparent> AV software is not a crutch, it's an extra level of defense. The issue is that it's the only \"level of defense\" which introduces arbitrary non-deterministic behavior. An executable which correctly follows all the APIs as documented and implemented, and which does nothing malicious, might arbitrarily be denied or even erased, and this behavior changes daily or even hourly due to factors outside the control of the computer's user. Even ASLR, which uses non-determinism in its implementation, doesn't cause non-deterministic behavior when an executable correctly follows the API. And it's also a \"level of defense\" which famously causes frequent performance issues, to the point that \"tell the AV to ignore that folder\" is a common recommendation. I wonder how many gigawatts of electricity are wasted daily due to AV software slowing things down. Finally, it's been reported several times that this \"level of defense\" is often poorly implemented, to the point that it can act as a backdoor to bypass other levels of defense. If you can compromise a parser running as SYSTEM, or even within the kernel, you don't have to worry about all the normal rules which prevents you from running code as SYSTEM or within the kernel. People's dislike of AV software does not come only from some abstract purity ideal; it also come from plenty of negative experiences with it. reply dotancohen 4 hours agorootparentprevI don't want an OS that lets me run executables from email - I've never actually has to do that.

Or would you provide your developers and sales people etc. with an existing OS, and run your servers on an existing OS, and deploy other security tools to mitigate the bugs in those existing OSs? reply noinsight 6 hours agoparentprevActually, arguably Windows has some impressive security features unseen on any other mainstream OS, they're just not used by default and - realistically - would be hard to enable on general purpose / non-corporate computers. For example, by comparison, Linux is in the stone age here. Do you even need AV if untrusted code can't run in the first place? * Application whitelisting - with just bare old AppLocker, Windows can be configured to only allow execution of trusted executables, DLLs and scripts by path, hash or software vendor (digital signature). Now, technically AppLocker is not a security feature, i.e. a hard security boundary. The next level functionality, Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) [1], however, is. I believe Microsoft was offering up to a $1M bug bounty for WDAC bypasses? With WDAC kernel mode code integrity enabled, only trusted digitally signed kernel modules can be loaded into the OS kernel [2]. WDAC user mode code integrity provides the aforementioned protection AppLocker provides. With AppLocker / WDAC enabled, the OS built-in script interpreters (Windows Script Host, PowerShell) either refuse to execute unsigned scripts completely or operate in restricted mode with reduced functionality. - By comparison, Linux only has fapolicyd which is only supported on Red Hat and can only rely on path-based rules because binaries are not directly signed on Linux. None? of the common interpreted languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, Bash) on Linux support digitally signed scripts and locking down interpretation. * Authentication material protection - Windows has Credential Guard [3] for protection of authentication material - Kerberos tickets and other material are placed in a separate container protected by hardware virtualization [2] and accessed via RPC so you can't dump process memory to compromise them.

EU have laws which limit how much you can opt out of liability _no matter what you write into a contract_ while I'm not sure about the exact boundaries per country but I'm pretty sure that at least all hospitals, emergency call services etc. can sue for a non-negligible part of the damages that outage caused directly private people which where harmed by not getting operations done in time most likely can also sue them for the full damages caused to them (through it's hard to assess the damages and it might need to be indirectly by suing the hospital and the hospital sues for more damages) what you likely will not be able to sue for is the lost opportunity cost, the man power needed to fix it etc. also my guess is that for a lot of cases which are not as sever as human damages or as indirect as lost opportunity cost a huge factor will depend on the degree of negligence judges believe happened.

From OP, in the OVH-case liability seems to override the contract / waivers when OVH was both the storage And backup provider and did not actively underline that this solution is suboptimal, in a situation where multiple data centers are physically very close. That's a chain of evidence. For CrowdStrike, it is clear that the offering is to more mature counter parties (thus raising the B2B standard of evidence) and that CrowdStrike very essentially did not do / support staging, whatever. This is indeed bad industry practice, but one that can thought to be explicit from the start of the agreement. At least in my locale you either make explicit agreements OR industry standards are leading. We do not do industry standard X is pretty clear. Read the list in OP, replace CrowdStrike with Microsoft and then think of the international liability cases you've heard from where Microsoft was found liable for downtime, hacks and other issues. Look, liabilities will always arise in such situations. But I expect only minor liabilities will arise. Mostly (AFAIK IANAL) the terms & conditions are applied in B2B-cases. This case is pretty obvious: you got what you signed up for. CrowdStrike with full scale access to your machines and no guarantees. On the other hand, Crowdstrike lost 125 billion in market cap.

Corporativism in US is a thing. Companies can brick hospital systems killing patients, drive self-driving cars and run over people but don't get sued, and if they do, they settle for very little. Just look at the recent Boeing incident where people were killed, the company clearly misled the US authorities and settled only a $0.5B fine. Those companies in those scenarios should pay the fine that they should ($20B+), and if it means the company would go bankrupt, do it and form a new company diluting the previous shareholders. Without doing this, shareholders and CEOs will have the incentive to carry on with their unfair practices that leads to dead people and deadlocked systems. reply wkat4242 7 hours agoparent> Just look at the recent Boeing incident where people were killed, the company clearly misled the US authorities and settled only a $0.5B fine. The problem is when you fine a company, they will just turn around and offload that cost to their customers. Which in this case is the US government in a very large way. Boeing will make their part in the SLS a few billion more expensive again to offset it and even gain some profit. The US government are just fining themselves. Fines just aren't an effective deterrent for companies. They should go back to imposing personal sentences on their leadership. But this is really unpopular because these guys are so well connected. So basically nothing is done and everyone goes free. reply aoeusnth1 6 hours agorootparentYou could force the company to pay the fine in the form of a % ownership stake in the company.

Idk, i guess i was expecting something more sophisticated based on the headline than just: spear phishing attempt foiled after user fails to click on the suspicious link. reply echoangle 9 hours agoparentWell, it wasn’t phishing. If the claims are correct, just opening the link would have compromised the phone. If that’s true, I find it try extraordinary. Phishing is just having a fake webpage asking for credentials, right? Infecting a phone with spyware just by visiting a webpage is much harder and much worse. reply bawolff 8 hours agorootparentSpear phishing is usually inclusive of attacks from an email that involve tricking the user into doing something unsafe. E.g. see definition https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/spea... > If the claims are correct, just opening the link would have compromised the phone I'm not sure if that is being claimed. The twitter post just said the link would have \"exposed\" them to spyware. One possible interpretation is that simply viewing the link in a web browser would be enough, but i think another interpretation is that the link contained some sort of malicious download. No way to know with the info we are given.

These companies pay good money for 0 days and invest considerable effort into finding their own. Also these attacks are aimed at individuals and executed by state actors. They likely already knew what phone, OS, and browser the MEP was using and selected an appropriate attack from the catalog. reply chatmasta 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, but the exploits are so valuable/expensive that they’ll only use them during targeted operations. Otherwise they risk burning the exploit. So just remain uninteresting and you should be safe. reply spurgu 9 hours agorootparentprevI would guess/assume that work phones of MEPs are restricted to a specific set of manufacturers and models, which makes targeting different from having to consider all options. They might also have specific software installed across most of them that could be part of the targeting. reply throwawaydummy 12 hours agoparentprevDon’t we live in a world where zero click exploits are a thing? I thought the target didn’t have to click the links just receive them reply xn7 10 hours agorootparentZero click exploits are a thing, but they are very expensive and have limited shelf life (once they have been used a few times, they tend to get found out and patched). Most actors won’t use one, unless it is a very, very high value target. It seems that the EU parliament member was not high value enough, and got lucky. reply trueismywork 10 hours agorootparentprevThat's why I disable HTML in emails reply seanhunter 9 hours agorootparentJust to be aware that's a start but it's not a full mitigation. Some of the prominent zeroclick exploits have been \"rich content\" in messaging products such as whatsapp[1] and imessage[2]. Definitely not an expert but I'm presuming they take advantage of the \"helpful\" behaviour those apps have to preview content and then pair that with some sort of exploit in the library that parses/displays the content. So say they have an exploit in a jpeg library that whatsapp uses then they send a specially-crafted jpeg via whatsapp, whatsapp \"previews\" the image and that triggers the exploit to compromise the jpeg library and pwn the user.

These things go in cycles, when the pendulum shifts too far to the left or to the right, it tends to swiftly move back the other way, and so the cycle continues. Example: the far right tries to depict the left as degenerates who want to make all children gay just because they support introducing LGBT+ friendly material to the school education. I'm sure some people buy that and hence become more inclined to reject the left, as who wants to \"force\" children to become homosexual, or transgender, right?! Now, whether China/Russia are doing it or not, I have no idea, and I suspect no one here does.

Is this normal for these datasets? How are we able to build such powerful models with such poor quality data? reply whiplash451 13 hours agoparentDeep learning is robust to massive label noise [1] Not to say that data quality does not matter, but these noisy sets are still very useful. [1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694 reply sigmoid10 8 hours agorootparentMinor correction: Deep learning using gradient descent is incredibly robust to noise. If you know the mathematics, this also makes sense intuitively: gradients of incorrect labels will generally point in random directions, whereas the \"truth\" points in a specific direction (and I explicitly mean truth in the sense of what is portrayed consistently as fact in the dataset, not the real world truth). So when you accumulate gradients, you will end up with a net effect that moves weights only towards the consistent answers. Since gradient descent is by far the most popular algorithm, it's easy to conflate these two things. But there are other approaches that don't treat noise so well. reply zsyllepsis 13 hours agoparentprevI think the labels could be much, much worse. They could contain straight noise, just completely random text - not even words. They could also contain plausible, factual text which otherwise has no relationship with the text. I think most commonly image datasets like this consist of images and their captions, with the presumption that the content author had _some_ reason of associating the two. The goal of the model is to learn that association. And with a _lot_ of examples, to learn nuanced representations. In the third image, for example, we see some kind of text on a material. The caption mentions \"Every year he rides for someone we know, touched by cancer\". Perhaps the model is fed another example of bicycle races, with similar imagery of racing bibs. Perhaps its fed another of a race that specifically mentions it's a charity ride to raise money for cancer. Perhaps.... You get the idea. Alone, each example provides only vague connections between the image and the caption. But when you have a ton of data it becomes easier to separate noise from a weak signal. reply punnerud 22 hours agoprevMore info on the Salesforce blog: https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/mint-1t/ reply j7ake 22 hours agoparentWow did not expect sales force to be behind this.

You could then train on any kind of digital data. reply derefr 19 hours agoparentDue to the way tokenization usually works with LLMs (using BPE — Byte Pair Encoding), there's actually usually already a 256-element embedding within the token-space that represents \"raw bytes.\" You could say that this 256-element set is \"pre-seeded\" into any BPE encoding — and will remain as part of the encoding as long as at least one document in the dataset used to determine the tokenization, uses each byte at least once in a non-high-frequency-suffix-predictable way. These tokens are also already very much in use by the tokenizer — they get emitted in sequences, to encode single Unicode codepoints that weren't common enough in the dataset to get their own tokens, and so instead require multiple tokens to represent them. I believe most tokenizers (e.g. tiktoken) just take the UTF-8 byte-sequences underlying these codepoints and encode them literally as sequences of the above 256-element set. If you're curious, here's the definition of the encoding used by most modern LLMs, in newline-delimited \"[base64 of raw input byte sequence] [tokenID to encode as]\" format: https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/encodings/cl100k_... . If you decode it, you can observe that the rest of the 256-element single-byte embedding space gets mapped to tokenIDs immediately following those of the ASCII printables. reply nodja 21 hours agoparentprevSomewhat inefficient for text, very inefficient for images, specially if you work in pixel space. The max context a model today has been trained is 1M tokens, which takes up a lot of memory. Even if context was not an issue, to generate a 1000x1000 image would take ~3 hours on 100token/s inference. Google has trained an encoder/decoder LLM on bytes called ByT5[1] [1] https://huggingface.co/google/byt5-xxl reply Tostino 20 hours agorootparentI think the work on multi-token prediction[0] within a single turn could be a significant development that makes byte-level tokenization models more practical. This approach allows the model to predict multiple tokens in parallel, potentially addressing the efficiency concerns raised about byte-level models. By predicting multiple tokens simultaneously, it could significantly speed up inference time, especially for tasks that require generating large amounts of data (like images). This could help mitigate the performance bottleneck mentioned in the parent comment about generating a 1000x1000 image.

Tokenization: - Serves as a form of compression. The main benefit of that is supporting longer sequences for any given context window. As a side benefit, it squeezes about the same amount of \"information\" into each token -- meaning you don't have to add any terms to your model to account for such an imbalance (or even test whether that hyperparameter matters). - Allows you to insert stuff other than the raw data into your stream of \"tokens\" to the LLM. For something like a chatbot, that could be as simple as a prefix to whoever's talking next (e.g., system, user, model). You similarly probably want control characters to denote the end of a sequence. If you have multi-modal content (e.g., text + images), you need some way to delimit the transition between those. All of those problems could mostly be solved with an appropriate encoding scheme, but that's basically tokenization by a different name (in that it's a transformation from one set of tokens to another that you have to apply to every input). You can solve that second problem trivially with just a vocabulary of 256 \"byte\" tokens plus O(1) control tokens, so that's not a huge deal in practice, just a point worth mentioning if we're talking about actually naively encoding bytes. The first problem is more interesting. One observation is that if for your particular problem tokenization doesn't offer much compression, the difference won't matter much, or will favor raw bytes over tokenization if the tokenization isn't tailored to your particular data. IIRC there was something about Hebrew text floating around as an example of raw byte models performing better than tokenized models. Another observation is that if your particular model has any form of compression for redundant state space (not true of any sort of vanilla transformer, mostly not true for any major competitor, technically possible regardless), especially if the cost of processing a token isn't substantially greater than the cost per byte of tokenizing an input, you also don't buy anything from tokenization. You're absolutely able to feed that raw data in and let the model handle the details. On the flip side, suppose you're handling vanilla English text with a vanilla transformer. You can support something like 50x longer sequences basically for free by adding tokenization. You'd be silly not to. Image transformers are slightly different in some sense, at least in typical implementations. The tokenization is lossy (not injective), and the de-tokenization must therefore have the opposite property (not a function -- or, since it is a function, it either doesn't reproduce every possible input image patch or has randomness to at least match the right distribution hopefully). They're often called the same thing, but I view that as something different from tokenization. Certain categories of problems (much like the English text example above) are made drastically cheaper by the process. Others (unlike the English text example above) are rendered impossible by the loss of information. A byte vocabulary makes those theoretically possible again, but you suddenly need a way to handle the \"entropy per byte\" problem which you didn't have to care about before. Maybe one last idea, fuzzy detokenization (like in image transformers) has a notable advantage in spec adherence. Outputting an image and then letting some other hand-written code convert that to a png is much more likely to produce something usable than outputting a png directly, byte by byte. The whole thing is probabilistic, and the flurry of strategies you've seen along the lines of \"decode while greedily adhering to a schema (json being the canonical example everyone wants to use for some reason, if you want to search for it)\" produce the wrong output distribution, often drastically so, by virtue of the biased sampling on something only correct because of its conditional probabilities. I'm not sure exactly how big of a model you need (or how tailored of a loss function) to make a model reliably output correct, large png files, but the current SOTA isn't there yet for general-purpose problems. In practice, people have made some byte-token models. They vary from \"meh\" to SOTA depending on the problem. On most problems, they're much more expensive than tokenized solutions. Interestingly, when they're SOTA they tend to be among the cheaper solutions. I've been chipping away at some new model architectures, and something kind of like a byte-token solution is pretty suitable for those, largely because the model itself offers that compression you would otherwise obtain from tokenization. I'll finish and release them one of these years. For transformers though, the byte-token solution is usually only interesting insofar as proving people's suspicions. Results are fine, not amazing, except in special cases. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Wikipedia defines it as: Reverse engineering, also called backwards engineering or back engineering, is the process by which an artificial object is deconstructed to reveal its designs, architecture, code, or to extract knowledge from the object. It is similar to scientific research, the only difference being that scientific research is conducted into a natural phenomenon. Whew, that was quite a mouthful, wasn't it? Well, it is one of the main reasons why this tutorial set exists. To make reverse engineering as simple as possible. This comprehensive set of reverse engineering tutorials covers x86, x64 as well as 32-bit ARM and 64-bit architectures. If you're a newbie looking to learn reversing, or just someone looking to revise on some concepts, you're at the right place. As a beginner, these tutorials will carry you from nothing upto the mid-basics of reverse engineering, a skill that everyone within the realm of cyber-security should possess. If you're here just to refresh some concepts, you can conveniently use the side bar to take a look at the sections that has been covered so far. You can get the entire tutorial set in PDF or MOBI format. All these ebook versions will get updated automatically as new tutorials will be added.

Andrew Tridgell explaining how he reverse engineered Microsoft's SMB protocol with the \"French cafe technique\": https://www.samba.org/ftp/tridge/misc/french_cafe.txt Tridge also reverse engineered BitKeeper, the proprietary software that Linus foolishly used to host Linux kernel development for a while. He noticed that if you telnet to the BitKeeper address:port rather than use its proprietary client, you can type \"help\" and it then spits out a list of commands to try... You can then interrogate the repository with these commands and get a complete understanding of all the internal data structures, without ever using the proprietary software, let alone having to disassemble it. The fact that Tridge did this reverse-engineering led BitKeeper's owner, Larry McVoy, to rescind the Linux community's use of his software, so Linus wrote git. reply tsujamin 56 minutes agoparentAn undergrad highlight for me was hearing the bitkeeper/git story from Tridge one afternoon that he happened to be in the faculty lunch room :) reply actionfromafar 58 minutes agoparentprevSo Andrew saved us not only once, but twice!

I learned reverse engineering by staring at CE/IDA for entirely too many hours as a kid, which means whenever someone asks me for advice on how to learn reverse engineering I don't really have any good answers :) I think in reality it's the type of thing you do just have to try and spend some time on. The OP tutorial comes across as very sparse, both trying to cover too much and also not really teaching reverse engineering skills more than most people would be able to pick up in a few hours of messing around. beginners.re in contrast is massive, but also much more in-depth and goes step-by-step; on the other hand crackmes are probably better hands on challenges to try. reply boricj 22 minutes agoparentprevGoing straight for reverse-engineering is doable, but it's significantly harder without some engineering background, either formal or self-taught. I have an ongoing reverse-engineering project for a video game and I ended up getting in contact with a self-taught modder of the game, who doesn't know how to program. He learned more in a couple of evening Discord calls with me showing him around the reverse-engineered Ghidra project, explaining the basics of computer program engineering as we went, than he did flipping bits with Cheat Engine. He then proceeded to recreate a fairly ambitious mod that was showcased in a Youtube video 15 years ago but never released, something that was bugging him for years but was unable to recreate. I steered him throughout, but by seeing how the pieces fit together he then managed to do the same mod on the sequel (which was never done before) all by himself. Experience with engineering gives you perspective when reverse-engineering. reply llmblockchain 13 minutes agorootparentLearning engineering can only help-- but there's something about a (often times young) person with time and borderline unhealthy curiosity banging their head on a puzzle until they figure it out.

Applied reverse engineer is usually modifying an existing piece of software so: * .dll/lib injection * signature scanning and patching * packet interception and rewriting * mitm HTTP(s) calls These are just a few places where you see reverse engineering used, usually to modify existing software. I'm curious if there's any reading out there that covers this stuff from the meat and potatoes and less of this CS 101 stuff. I've done all of the above, and you can usually learn about this stuff from some different forums on the web, but I don't know of any good bibles on the subject matter. reply boricj 2 hours agoparentApplied reverse-engineering is all about bending the rules of engineering. Because of this, I think it can be learned through experience, but I doubt it can be taught through theory (or at least not in an effective manner). At its core, it's about spotting metapatterns to gain an understanding of a program and applying leverage to affect it. That's more art than science, no matter how much tooling you throw at it. Honestly, I think the most effective way to learn about how to reverse-engineer something is to learn engineering at the same layer first and then start tinkering. If you want to binary patch a program, learn assembly. If you want to inject a .dll, learn how to write and use dynamic libraries. If you want to MITM a REST API, learn how to call a REST API. Because once you know the rules well, you can start breaking them and see exactly how much you can get away with. I wrote a series of articles on reverse-engineering on my blog, about studying and modifying a program that outputs an ASCII table, mostly because I needed a way to introduce delinking as a technique. I would not say it's good, but it starts with how to build the case study and then it handholds the reader through the meat and potatoes. reply palata 24 minutes agorootparent> I wrote a series of articles on reverse-engineering on my blog, about studying and modifying a program that outputs an ASCII table, Would you mind sharing the links? I would be interested! reply boricj 14 minutes agorootparentYou can find the table of contents for the series there: https://boricj.net/reverse-engineering/2023/05/01/introducti... I expect that you'll be mostly interested in parts 2 through 6. Part 1 explains how a toolchain works in general (so mostly CS 101 stuff as the OP put it). Parts 7 to 10 demonstrates the delinking technique by easing into it, a technique which is as powerful as it is esoteric, but probably not what you're looking for in a beginner's guide. reply darby_nine 2 hours agoparentprev> I'm curious if there's any reading out there that covers this stuff from the meat and potatoes In my experience using radare2 to peek at the code is pretty much the meat and potatoes of reverse engineering binaries and far from \"CS 101 stuff\". You certainly don't need to modify a binary to MITM an API or inspect/alter packets or inject code via dynamic loading; nor is it the most convenient or clean or easy to maintain way to do so. Secondly, this is a shockingly dismissive attitude for such a large resource. It took me a few minutes to just read through the table of contents. reply andrewmcwatters 2 hours agorootparentJust because it's large doesn't mean it's relevant: using radare2, IDA Pro, or some other tool doesn't mean you're going to be able to do anything besides look at a binary. I mean, you said you read the table of contents, yeah? Doing the same thing across different CPU architectures isn't doing something at length, it's just doing the same thing over and over again in rhymes. In practice, yeah, people in the wild are absolutely modifying binaries, injecting, stubbing .dlls and redirecting calls, or creating proxy servers that alter payloads, for sure. Learning how to compile a program isn't exactly reverse engineering worthy content to write about. reply acureau 2 hours agorootparentI disagree, learning how to compile a program is a prime example of something you'd want in a book about reverse engineering \"for everyone\". A book which focuses only on specific methods of changing software behavior would be useful only to those who know how to understand said software. In fact the term \"reverse engineering\" itself does not imply modification at all. reply darby_nine 2 hours agorootparentprev> Just because it's large doesn't mean it's relevant: using radare2, IDA Pro, or some other tool doesn't mean you're going to be able to do anything besides look at a binary. Looking at a binary is like 99% of the work, though. Or at least looking at some secondary form of it (e.g. assembly, decompilation, etc). Tools are absolutely critical to the work. > people in the wild are absolutely modifying binaries, injecting, stubbing .dlls and redirecting calls, or creating proxy servers that alter payloads, for sure I would call modifying a binary \"cracking\" it but it's been a few decades since I was involved in that scene. I also think that the topic is large enough to warrant multiple focuses—to me, at least, writing a MITM server is much more trivial than extracting a private key from a binary (or a running process) that makes that MITM server functionally useful. > Learning how to compile a program isn't exactly reverse engineering worthy content to write about. That's a disingenuous characterization of most of the content here. Coding at the instruction level requires a different way of reading and writing code than you're otherwise exposed to. Most programmers aren't used to handling bits directly, and certainly not to the extent that it rewards you at the instruction level for learning and knowing. With the tools here you can, in fact, sit down and inspect the license verification function of a piece of software (although I'm not sure how much that's true or beneficial these days with code-signing etc). EDIT: Or you could do what I did and work with as, `otool`, and a hex editor, and learn extremely slowly & painfully why custom-built reverse engineering tools are so valuable to learn. There's always more to learn, of course, but that's no reason to belittle what you've already learned and other people still have yet to learn. reply andrewmcwatters 2 hours agorootparentYeah, I'm sure what I'm saying probably comes off as belittling, but that's not my intent. It's just more productive to understand who the audience is. The author write \"free PDF\" content with Guy Fawkes mask header images in the README.mds. If you're going to target script kiddies, at least show them how to Hello, World! from a DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, and then teach them sigscanning. reply jonpalmisc 2 hours agoparentprev [–] Resources exist, but are only so helpful IMO. One can't necessarily build an airplane after watching a documentary on it. Even if there was some \"bible\" on it, reverse engineering is one of those things that you have to put the reps in for to get good at it and actually develop understanding. The \"bible\" is tackling reverse-engineering related projects independently over the course of months/years and picking up knowledge along the way. Starting with something like cracking software (and making increasingly-advanced cracks) is always my advice for beginners. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "X Redesigns Water Pistol Emoji Back To A Firearm X (fka Twitter) has quietly redesigned its 🔫 Water Pistol emoji to display as a firearm. This diverges from the cross-platform conversion of this emoji from firearm to water pistol from 2016 to 2018. Keith Broni Jul 23, 2024 • 2 min read The social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) has redesigned its 🔫 Water Pistol emoji to display as an actual firearm. This redesign diverges from the designs of all other major emoji vendors, inverting the cross-platform conversion of this emoji away from being a firearm between 2016 and 2018. Above: comparison between Twitter's Water Pistol design and X's new redesign of this emoji as a firearm. This update is available through X's web client, which still displays the Twemoji emoji design set. It began its rollout on July 18th, the day after World Emoji Day 2024. update announcement 📢 on x dot com (the website), the gun emoji was returned back into its rightful form: an m1911 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫 https://t.co/FlXJtOpU3H pic.twitter.com/cqd7KHcxUJ — kache (@yacineMTB) July 18, 2024 In February 2023 the Twemoji set ceased to be used by Twitter / X on mobile devices, replaced by the device's native emoji designs. This means this update will not be seen on Android devices. The Twitter / X app for iOS has always used the native emojis provided by Apple. However, the X engineer responsible for the change, kache, has since stated that they will be \"soon updating the rendering on mobile\". They also stated that this design is \"not the final design (going to make it look more badass)\". As mentioned above, this change by X in effect reverts a cross-vendor design change for the 🔫 Water Pistol emoji (fka the 🔫 Pistol emoji) that was fully implemented in 2018 following a much-publicized design change by Apple in 2016. Above: A comparison of pistol emoji designs from major vendors 2013—2018. This is the first update to the version of the original Twemoji emoji design set used by X since July last year, when the designs of the 😷 Face with Medical Mask, 🥺 Pleading Face, and 🥹 Face Holding Back Tears emojis were updated. Additionally, since October 2022 a separate branch of Twemoji has been maintained on former Twemoji designer Justine De Caires' Github. This offshoot remains open source and has had contributions made by Discord designers. The 🔫 Water Pistol emoji in this Discord-used Twemoji offshoot remains as the design originally implemented on Twitter in 2018. 📖 Read More All Major Vendors Commit to Gun Redesign (April 2018) Google Updates Gun Emoji (April 2018) Apple And The Gun Emoji (August 2016)",

Isn't the entire purpose of having a standard set of emojis as part of Unicode to enable reliable communication of the concepts and emotions associated with them? In that sense it's perfectly fine if it was a water pistol, a real gun or whatever else as long as it's the same thing everywhere. But the same codepoint showing up as a water pistol to one half of the audience and as a gun to the other seems to be just begging for misunderstandings - and in a charged atmosphere like X no less where this could easily spiral into drama, shitstorms or worse. reply Alupis 21 hours agoparent> This seems like approximately the dumbest possible place to have political battles. Isn't the entire purpose of having a standard set of emojis as part of Unicode to enable reliable communication of the concepts and emotions associated with them? Does anyone see what's happened here? A small group of people made a political decision and force changed the pistol emoji into a water gun. Then... later on, someone else undoes the change and suddenly now they're blamed for waging a political battle! We see this elsewhere too. Github with master -> main, despite master remaining the default everywhere else and causing endless confusion with examples/tutorials all over the internet. Immigrants -> Migrants, voting laws returning to pre-covid rules (and being likened to Jim Crow on Steroids as a result), etc. There's a segment of society that's in love with renaming/changing things everyone else was fine with, and then when people try to change things back - they're attacked as radical political warmongers. reply xg15 21 hours agorootparentI can't speak for everyone, but as far as I'm concerned, the initial change to a water gun was just as stupid and damaging as this one. My point is just that changing it back now is not undoing the damage, it's creating even more damage. reply JohnFen 20 hours agorootparentI agree. One of the reasons why I hesitate to use emojis is that there isn't enough standardization of what they look like. I've seen texts I've written that include them on other devices and have been pretty dismayed that that even relatively minor visual differences can make a huge difference in the meaning I intended vs the meaning that was actually received. The water pistol/gun thing is this taken to an extreme. The initial change was bad because it introduced a huge amount of uncertainty in meaning. The change back is bad for exactly the same reason. reply PostOnce 20 hours agorootparentIn my experience, the water pistol was still used to denote violence, it was just dressed up to somehow make big tech feel less culpable for violent(ly emotional) social media. reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparentAs with all emojis, what they mean depends on the social group using them. In my social group, the gun version was never used for anything. When it became a water pistol, though, it started to get used to indicate a certain sort of playfulness. reply sharpshadow 7 hours agorootparentprevI’m my opinion a finger pistol would be appropriate. reply anonfordays 20 hours agorootparentprev>My point is just that changing it back now is not undoing the damage, it's creating even more damage That's just like, your opinion man!

For example, for me, it never changed because I do most of my typing/etc on an older system without modern unicode extensions post-v6. It was and is always a mess. There's no stability like you say. But if we want to measure something objective: the majority of unicode versions have been the firearm, not the water pistol. reply philistine 18 hours agorootparent> the majority of unicode versions Objective, but deeply flawed. Most people around the world are running code updated past a version released in 2018. reply cmiles74 21 hours agorootparentprevThe phrase \"small group of people\" is doing a lot of work, I think. We had the largest technology/media companies in the country making similar changes. reply Alupis 21 hours agorootparentThe reality is a small handful of people - or even one person - makes these decisions. Nonetheless, even if we were to believe 100% of the people at Twitter, Facebook, Google, et al decided on this change together, it's still a small group of people and it still is a political decision. reply bathtub365 6 hours agorootparentprevAll of the employees of all of those companies combined are still a small group of people compared to the number subjected to the results of their decisions. reply qsort 22 hours agoparentprevThis is why I believe including emoji in unicode was a blunder. A capital \"A\" is the same in any font; I can write a message in monospace and my interlocutor can read it in sans-serif, or tap in morse code and have it rendered in hand- writing, in all cases the difference is immaterial. On the other hand we don't use pictures in the same way, the meaning of the message depends on the exact picture used as part of the \"font\". The whole thing about flags and skin tones are symptoms of the same problem. reply ploxiln 21 hours agorootparentEven more, fonts having multiple colors in a glyph was a huge complexity explosion for font rendering, for terminals, and more. You can see a very quick technical summary of different ways of encoding colors in fonts here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType#Color_fonts But anyway, images should have remained separate things, png or whatever. Fonts rendering is complex enough with complex scripts e.g. Arabic, but that is the domain of fonts/shaping/rendering. Such a hugely expensive technical mess because people want their stupid color emojis. reply philistine 18 hours agorootparentYou want to stay stuck in the past, that's your call. I for one stay fascinated by the prospect of colour being introduced into written languages to denote intent now that we don't have to grapple with ink. We're talking on the scale of centuries, but even Arrival didn't have the guts to include colour into the lexicon of its alien language.

For example, the \" \" emoji, described by Unicode as \"health worker\" is called \"non-binary doctor\" by Apple. If you send that emoji in a text to somebody, and they're e.g. using accessibility software, wearing AirPods and have notifications read out to them by Siri, or have their phone integrated with CarPlay etc, the message they'll hear is very different from what you actually intended to say. reply XMPPwocky 21 hours agorootparentAnd for me on Firefox on Android, it renders as a blank space! reply amadeuspagel 21 hours agorootparentHN filters emojis. reply vitaminCPP 21 hours agorootparentprevSame reply xigoi 11 hours agorootparentprevThe irony of assuming someone’s gender for political correctness… reply derefr 21 hours agorootparentprevUnicode is descriptive, not prescriptive. The point of any glyph at all being allocated a Unicode codepoint, is that the glyph already exists in documents somewhere (either real paper documents, or digital documents in some other legacy encoding); and if Unicode didn't include a codepoint to encode that glyph, then that text wouldn't be able to be faithfully represented in Unicode. Which means that some ephemeral undocumented proprietary encoding might be used instead (as in “cellphone novels” in late-90s Japan, now permanently committed to the Internet in the form of SJIS encoding + some particular feature-phone’s SJIS pictograph codepage that no modern OS can decode.) Or worse, that the character and its contribution to the meaning of the document might be lost entirely (as in MSN or ICQ messenger emoticons, where exporting chat logs as HTML would just strip the emoticons out.) Putting whatever glyphs already exist into Unicode, no matter how rarely, is precisely what makes Unicode uni-code — i.e. an encoding that guarantees lossless archival \"transmission into the future\" of all texts, such that all texts should be better off transcoded into Unicode. (At least if the intent is to archive their semantic meaning as text, rather than their bytewise representation as data for software-archaeology purposes.) --- The standard of \"if it already has usage, then it must get a Unicode codepoint so that the document can be Unicode-encoded\" is all well and good at face value, and worked well as a guideline for the first ~10 versions of the Unicode spec. Until ~2009, pretty much nobody was arguing against codepoint allocations being \"warranted.\" But then the modern mobile platforms realized that they essentially had a gun they could hold to Unicode’s head — in the sense that any glyph they wanted to invent, they could threaten to release into the wild as proprietary encoding if Unicode doesn’t include it. And because millions of people would be guaranteed to make tweets et al using that new symbol, Unicode is essentially forced to include it. Even though it doesn’t exist yet until that moment. All the “dumb” emoji—and color emoji in general, and the explosion in variation selectors—came after that. In est, they’re Apple and Google’s fault, not the Unicode Consortium’s. reply qsort 21 hours agorootparentUnicode is definitely a prescriptive standard. Code point 65 is a capital A because Unicode says so -- any such standard is necessarily prescriptive. > Which means that some ephemeral undocumented proprietary encoding might be used instead I'm not arguing against the need of some standard for representing those, I'm just objecting to the technical decision of incorporating them as code points, because they don't serve the same semantical purpose. Instead you could have introduced -- for example -- a simple vector graphics format. reply relaxing 20 hours agorootparentIt’s literally there in the standard: “The shapes of the reference glyphs used in these code charts are not prescriptive.” The standard says “pistol”, what a pistol looks like is left to the implementer. reply JohnFen 20 hours agorootparentIt's exactly this that makes Unicode the wrong place to define emojis. reply relaxing 15 hours agorootparentYou’re allowed to make your letters however you want too, even if they’re ambiguous. reply JohnFen 4 hours agorootparentThe difference is that the alphabet has well-defined meaning. Stylistic differences in the appearance of letters doesn't alter those meanings. This is not so true with emojis. Their meaning is directly determined by their appearance and so stylistic differences can alter their meaning. reply derefr 20 hours agorootparentprev> Unicode is definitely a prescriptive standard. Code point 65 is a capital A because Unicode says so -- any such standard is necessarily prescriptive. You're missing the point. Unicode is descriptive like a dictionary is descriptive: it describes — and thereby locks into place and somewhat formalizes (really: ossifies) — existing usage. If you prefer, rather than \"prescriptive\" vs \"descriptive\", you can pretend I said \"proactive\" vs \"reactive.\" Unicode as a standard reacts to existing out-of-Unicode usage of glyphs, by defining into existence Unicode code-points to allow the encoding of those glyphs. (Or rather, to allow encoding of any of the equivalence-class-hypersphere of glyph-configuration-space described by the name of the codepoint, as that codepoint. Those particular codepoints have been defined through usage, whether the Unicode Consortium likes it or not.) But even that's not quite accurate, because, especially with the modern forced assignments by Apple/Google, Unicode in fact is purely describing — documenting — codepoint assignments that the OEMs decided on and implemented unilaterally, ahead of standardization. (I.e., Apple/Google now just allocate new codepoints for emoji and assign them glyphs all on their own — and Unicode then must play catch-up, including those codepoints in the standard only after they're already shipping on real devices and thereby effectively already \"locked in\" in their meanings.) > Because they don't serve the same semantical purpose. Instead you could have introduced -- for example -- a simple vector graphics format. They quite clearly do serve a semantic purpose: • Screen readers can describe an emoji — and smart ones can even use an emoji at the end of a sentence to add emotional color to their reading of the sentence. This would not be possible if emoji were just vector images. • LLMs have particular trained associations on what a given arbitrary Unicode codepoint should relate to. It would be prohibitively difficult for them to form the same associations between regular word tokens, and the huge sequence of tokens that collectively represents a vector image. • Search engines can index emoji just like any other text. No search engine that I know of could embed a vector image in its fulltext index in a useful way. • If a font doesn't represent an emoji, people can still copy-and-paste the unrepresentable-codepoint-glyph rendering of the codepoint into their OS's character map to get a Unicode-standardized description of the codepoint. This wouldn't be true if emoji were just arbitrary vector images. Also, if you wanted to oust some glyphs from Unicode in favor of embedded vector images, where would you stop? If U+1F60A \"Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes\" shouldn't be in Unicode, should U+2660 \"Black Spade Suit\"? How about U+21F6 \"Three Rightwards Arrows\", or U+2713 \"Check Mark\"? U+2766 \"Floral Heart\" / U+2042 \"Asterism\"? reply kremi 22 hours agorootparentprevI’m pretty sure the thumbs up emoji or the slightly smiling emoji won’t get different interpretations based on font. And here the issue is not in font differences (or different pictures of the same thing getting different interpretations): it’s the thing represented that’s actually different. reply jorvi 22 hours agorootparentIn the earlier days of emojis, some Samsung or blob emojis definitely look different enough from Apple emojis that it caused confusion.. reply sangnoir 22 hours agorootparentprev> A capital \"A\" is the same in any font; I can write a message in monospace and my interlocutor can read it in sans-serif, or tap in morse code and have it rendered in hand- writing, in all cases the difference is immaterial Many typefaces are have problematic I/l/1 and O/0 characters, and that is material enough that applications avoid those characters entirely to avoid potential confusion. The problem is deeper than unicode: the fact that any codepoints can be rendered differently from client to client or typeface-to-typeface was always problematic, even back it was mostly ASCII. reply maxerickson 21 hours agorootparentprevIt's not like words have unambiguous meanings, it's not a new problem. reply labcomputer 21 hours agoparentprev> Isn't the entire purpose of having a standard set of emojis as part of Unicode to enable reliable communication of the concepts and emotions associated with them? Maybe? I mean, Unicode already explicitly does not encode glyphs, but code points. So point 65 is capital Roman “A”, but Unicode says nothing about how it should be displayed. Going further, certain code points represent characters which Unicode considers “the same” character in Japanese/Chinese/Korean even though they may be different in meaning, pronunciation, and visual appearance. Thus, you need to know which language is being writing before you can pick the correct glyph to put on the screen. So, while stupid, it doesn’t seem exactly wrong or unprecedented for X to change their glyph from a squirt gun to a pistol. reply mardifoufs 20 hours agoparentprevThis change started with Apple changing the emoji from a handgun to a water pistol out of the blue. I don't see the issue with another platform deciding they don't want that change, or preferring another style. The representation itself isn't standardized I think, a lot of emojis don't look very similar across different platforms. reply roughly 22 hours agoparentprevIt does have the benefit of making whatever X users decide to do with the gun look appropriately silly everywhere else. reply nebula8804 22 hours agoparentprevI wonder if there was a way for other clients to detect apple and translate their 'watergun' into a new emoji while keeping backwards compatibility on all other clients. Or another way for all vendors to push back against Apple is for all agree to not render the new emoji from Apple devices. Its too late now but one of these two would have been a good solution in 2016 to push back against Apple's nonsense. I guess since this is also used in SMS there is no way to properly detect the client its coming from? reply whywhywhywhy 20 hours agorootparentIt’s just a typeface and a Unicode character the client decides how it’s displayed An iPhone 1 would display a gun still. reply DavidVoid 22 hours agoparentprevIt's not exactly something new though.

My first thought exactly. My 2nd thought, glancing at the graphic of like 6 years and 6 companies and the evolution of the emoji.. there's a nontrivial amount of money thrown at all this \"work\", and once you think about all the meetings and emails and design iterations, the opinion pieces on the result, etc, the frivolous spend for this kind of nonsense is probably in the millions. Not to mention all of us taking a media break while we're on the clock! No real political sentiment even needs to be involved.. all this probably just represents make-work activity by folks looking to justify their continued employment.

I think that has potential for hilarity. It would certainly soften the impact of a certain group of imbeciles. reply delichon 22 hours agoparentprevDisagree. If the cat emoji becomes a dog, it isn't OK if it's the same everywhere. I don't think it's much different to turn the poo emoji into flowers, the bomb emoji into a kiss, or the pistol emoji into a water pistol. reply xg15 22 hours agorootparentI would extend \"the same thing everywhere\" through time as well, i.e. it's a bad thing to ever change the meaning of an emoji after it's been published, for the obvious reason that this messes with old texts and all other locations where the emoji has been used with the old meaning. This means that the move back then to change the gun to a water pistol was an extremely bad move, no question here. But moving it back to the original meaning now is just as bad - it will just disrupt in the same way lots of newer texts that assume the glyph is a water pistol. reply Muromec 21 hours agorootparentIt will keep happening the same way languages gradually change and for exactly the same reasons. Being in flux isn’t a bug, it’s the content of culture. Doing the stuff differently compared to /the other group/ to know you belong to /this group/ is everybody’s favorite game. reply Gormo 20 hours agorootparentNo, I don't think that applies here. Languages evolve and new terminology enters the lexicon all of the time, but that absolutely does not retrospectively change the rendering of pre-existing expressions of language. reply xg15 21 hours agorootparentprevThere are different ways how languages can change. A language changes organically, if individual people simply talk differently than their predecessors, out of convenience, without any specific intent or plan behind it. That's the way languages have always changed throughout history and keep changing. Deliberately changing a language and pressuring other people to adopt certain changes in their vocabulary is something entirely different. That too has been tried often in history, but has usually led to conflict and was part of expressions of power. Emojis can change their meaning organically too, if people just start using them in a different way. Eggplant emoji being the most obvious example I think. But pushing an update to change the glyph would be about the most top-down and deliberate way to change its meaning that I can think of. reply aquova 22 hours agorootparentprevThe bizarre state of this emoji was that it already faced this change. One vendor (Apple I believe) decided to make it a water gun, slowly the rest of the industry followed, officially changing its name to \"water pistol\". Now the old battles are new again. reply forgotpwd16 21 hours agorootparentThe official name still is just \"pistol\" (and even more the latest Unicode standard specifies it as handgun, revolver). Not sure how Emojipedia decides on used name (seems to follow Apple) but (in this case at least) isn't using the standard one. reply tsimionescu 13 hours agorootparentprevThis would still happen with or without the platforms doing it. Like any other piece of language, emoji will change meaning over time or between groups, and make it hard to read other group's texts. For a current example, if you see a text saying \"I loved your \", it can have at least two very different, but quite common meanings (either liking some eggplant based food, or a sexual allusion). reply deanCommie 22 hours agorootparentprevThe question isn't whether it was OK to turn the gun emoji into a water pistol in the first place. It doesn't matter if it wasn't. It was done, and it was done at a time when there was political will for everyone to follow suit and be consistent. The question is whether it's OK to turn it back. Because there ISN'T the same political will. And other emoji providers will NOT follow X in this. Having X \"go back\" because the original change was \"unjust\" doesn't fix the underlying problem. It creates a new one.

What will they change next, who initiated and coordinated that effort, and why, are all important questions. I'm very much against it.

Are you against violent video games as well? reply wewtyflakes 22 hours agorootparent> In no way does an emoji encourage armed violence. Obviously, in a vacuum, an emoji does not do anything at all. Though emojis are used in context to convey intent, just as words are. Would you say words do not encourage armed violence?

That is not to say we should ban words, but lets not kid ourselves and pretend they have no power at all. reply bawolff 22 hours agorootparentBut isn't that the point of the person you are replying to? Its the meaning of the ideas being communicated not individual glyphs. A gun emoiji does not neccesarily mean \"lets shoot up the place\". A water pistol is similar enough to a gun that anyone who has that meaning in mind can easily just use it and be understood. Or they could just use something else with an understood meaning. After all, many emoiji have context specific meanings. An eggplant is not just an eggplant. Its just downright silly to ban things at this level of abstraction. It wont stop people talking about guns. reply ben_w 22 hours agorootparentprev> That is not to say we should ban words, but lets not kid ourselves and pretend they have no power at all. Indeed. The whole reason I value freedom of speech is not a love of certain voices, but because of the power of speech to effect change. Took me a long time to realise that while all improvements are change, not all change is an improvement. Dictators fear free speech because it has the power to take away their power. That power can also be used, has been used, to take away democracy. reply ben_w 22 hours agorootparentprevContext is king. The sentence \"it's time to cut down the tall trees\" doesn't seem like it should trigger a genocide, but it did. If you send a firearm emoji in response to someone asking what they think of the 2020 USA presidential election result, that seems to be a fairly explicit encouragement of armed violence. A water pistol, not so much — likewise either \"gun\" variant in response to plans for summer holiday sports ideas. When it comes to tall trees?

Neither of those definitions have helped me understand what you are so vehemently against. Can you help me understand what woke culture is to you? This is a genuine question. reply waterhouse 22 hours agorootparent(Not the person you were asking, either) In one sentence, wokeness is aggressively pursuing racial (and other identity-based) conflict above everything else, not caring what else you trample on (including even classic civil rights principles). \"Microaggressions\" is probably the most distinctively woke concept. Censoring gun emojis is not woke in that respect, since it doesn't pursue any particular identity conflict (except, maybe, crusading on behalf of anyone with gun-related PTSD?). But the method (forcing people to sanitize their communication) and some aspects of the motivation (hand-wringing about some bits of language, acting like some people have extremely delicate sensibilities, using that to justify censorship) are similar to some prominent manifestations of wokeness and the corporate policies they push. So I can understand why the connection was drawn, though the term isn't quite appropriate. reply consteval 2 hours agorootparentI think micro-aggressions are very real, but maybe the word is a little off. They're not aggressive necessarily, but they are micro. What I mean is that definitely phrases and questions change meaning, a tiny bit, based off of historical understanding of race and gender. On the surface it seems like a wild proposition, but it's really true. - wow you're so articulate! - your hair looks so clean! - don't you like this kind of music? - you're a better driver than I expected! - you're so nurturing! To you, or me, innocuous. But people say these things for a reason. I've never heard a white man be told he's articulate, or that his hair looks clean. Do you know what I mean? These things are racially charged and \"othering\", regardless of if the perpetrator knows it or intends it. I'd say the vast majority of ANY prejudice is unconscious, meaning people don't know they're it. reply qual 22 hours agorootparentprevThanks for taking the time to write this out, I think it helps me understand a bit better.

That is no different than Christians trying to ban violent video games. Note that I am not the one who brought up the term to the conversation.

I would have found it much clearer if your comment said \"I am against censorship at it's core, vehemently\", and as an added bonus you wouldn't be annoyed by me asking about it.

It must be nice that he never has to deal with the consequences of his actions. reply YetAnotherNick 22 hours agorootparentprevAnd changing is back is significantly easier. You don't have to design it, get review etc. reply bitshiftfaced 23 hours agoparentprevYou can work on little things and big things at the same time. reply bastawhiz 23 hours agoparentprevMy thoughts exactly. For all the hand wringing they did about cutting costs, their focus is on redesigning emojis? It's obvious to me that Elon doesn't actually care about making the service better and solving real problems (like boosting revenue or fixing problems that impact users). reply blackeyeblitzar 23 hours agorootparentWhat makes you think their “focus” is on emojis? This is probably just one among many things they’re doing. And it’s the right thing to do, because the political censorship of the pistol emoji is yet another example of how deeply biased tech companies have been in pushing their politics onto customers. reply bastawhiz 23 hours agorootparentThere's zero cost to leaving the emoji as it is. The designer of the new version claims he's still working on it, so I don't know how you can say it's not a \"focus\". It's a waste of time and money for purely ideological reasons. reply theultdev 23 hours agorootparentThe change to the water gun was for ideological reasons. This is returning to the original. Without being the project manager, you're speculating on the amount of focus this had. reply bastawhiz 23 hours agorootparentIt's not a git revert. It is active effort to create a new emoji. There's zero cost to leaving it alone, there's material cost to changing it. Last time I checked, that's a bad way for a company that nearly went out of business to prioritize. reply theultdev 23 hours agorootparentWell, I guess we'll just see how it pays off for them. It's already making buzz so if it was an hour of work, I'd say the marketing effect alone was worth it. reply bastawhiz 22 hours agorootparentOh you're right, the pixels of an emoji are really going to be what reverses Twitter's loss of advertisers and active user counts reply theultdev 22 hours agorootparentNoone is saying that. I'm simply saying you're talking about Twitter right now because of it, and it was a small change. You know it was if you're an engineer, let's not play dumb.

Try making a death threat with a water gun reply DaSHacka 21 hours agorootparentThe amount of jokes, memes, and legitimate threats I've seen with the \"water gun\" emoji far outnumber the number of people using it to represent an actual water gun. In fact, I can't recall a single time I've seen it used in the context of water guns. People posting \"\" on Twitter/TikTok/whatever are just doing the emoji equivalent of saying \"I'm gonna shoot this guy, in Minecraft.\" Is it really better that the emoji is technically not an actual pistol?

Or that you could not make a water pistol that could also be a \"revolver\"? Does \"revolver\" include revolver action rifles, so long as you can use them with one hand (sawed offs, etc). If not, why not? If so, would that be a \"more\" appropriate emoji for some reason? I'm not saying they're further out of spec. But I disagree with your implication that they are somehow further in spec than a water pistol. Pistol is pistol. reply wongarsu 20 hours agorootparent> Are you implying that a water pistol is not a \"handgun\" Yes. If I asked you to bring me a gun (or a handgun) I don't think anyone would argue I might have meant a water pistol. A water pistol is a gun-shaped object, or an object that imitates a gun, but it isn't a gun. reply catapart 20 hours agorootparentIt fits the Webster definition: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gun If I ask you to bring me a gun, and there is a water gun right next to you and you argue that \"I might have meant water pistol\" (colloquially: refusing to assess the water gun as a \"gun\"), I would assume you were ignorant, dishonest, or both. reply xigoi 10 hours agorootparentA water gun is a gun in the same way that a gummy bear is a bear. reply catapart 6 hours agorootparentRight on. And if someone made a \"bear\" emoji as an image of a gummy bear, I wouldn't accuse them of being out of spec. I would just find it personally misleading. Things that might be appropriate to say with a bear emoji might not be appropriate to say with a gummy bear emoji. That could be confusing, and it could be frustrating. But - as the standard emoji convention is often just \"use whatever is closest\" (see: eggplant/peach) - I don't think there would be any real, practical problem by people using gummy bears as their \"bears\". So it's perfectly in spec and could easily be a practical solution. The same is true of the gun emoji. Hard for me to picture a scenario where I would need to communicate \"real gun\" but not want to say the words \"real gun\". And given the ubiquitous (until now) change in the icon, I have empirical evidence that it was an entirely practically appropriate solution. And, again, it was no further out of spec than an M1911. reply y04nn 23 hours agoparentprevIndeed, this is very 1984. Changing the meaning of a word, people express their thoughts with emojis, the meaning (representation in this case) should never be altered in such way. reply tonymet 23 hours agoparentprevthat can't possibly be true. this is the original reply edwinjm 23 hours agoparentprevWhy do you want a real gun? I bet most uses are to bully people. It seems that's the kind of social network Elon wants. reply rurp 22 hours agorootparentDoes changing it to a water pistol actually reduce bullying at all? I suspect not. My bet is that the water pistol change was driven by virtue signaling and corporate risk aversion rather than any real belief that it would do anything useful. Conversely though, the decision to change it back is probably driven by trolling and attention-seeking more than anything. reply whazor 21 hours agorootparentBut this emoji comes included by default with mobile phones. Realistically than means that young children get to see and use this emoji. Unknowingly, they might be sending death threats, whereas with a water gun that would be like a joke. reply bombcar 22 hours agorootparentprevBullying will occur no matter what emojis are available - even if you have to use 𓂺 or similar. Various knives are available if you want it, so if anything we should add MORE emojis (gun combining character something else = various types of gun, say). In fact, it's easier to have one \"known bad\" emoji to check than having hundreds to look at. reply anvuong 22 hours agorootparentprevAnd changing it to water pistol reduces the bullying? I have seen racism expressed through colored emoticons, destroying its original intents of inclusivity. It's stupid to change it in the first place, this is just doubling the stupidity. reply Murky3515 22 hours agorootparentprev>Why do you want to allow the word \"loser\" ?

It shouldn't have been changed in the first place, but two wrongs don't make a right either, it just makes the problem even worse. If we have older communications that use an emoji, it can retroactively edit the meaning if that emoji renders to a fundamentally different object than it used to, so this kind of change has the side effect of rewriting history unless people take extra care to only use fonts that match the age of the document. It's already hard enough to communicate clearly and effectively in the modern world without having the rug pulled out from under us with stuff like this. reply AdamH12113 23 hours agoprevA hundred years from now people are going to have a very... interesting time trying to figure out what meaning was intended by the use of these characters at the time a text was written. Personally, I think putting a huge set of pictograms into the Universal Character Set was a mistake and that emojis should be deprecated immediately, and this is the #1 reason why: the meaning of a text should not normally change based on the font used to render it. reply gruez 23 hours agoparent>A hundred years from now people are going to have a very... interesting time trying to figure out what meaning was intended by the use of these characters at the time a text was written. Is this any different than for words? \"Retarded\" used used to be the polite way to convey intellectual disability, until it slowly turned into a pejorative. Same word, different meaning. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphemism#Lifespan reply AdamH12113 20 hours agorootparentSure, meaning always depends on context, but this is a lower-level difference. If I copy an English sentence from a hundred-year-old book into Microsoft Word, it doesn't change the meaning of the sentence. If I write a sentence containing emojis on e.g. an Android phone and read that exact bitwise-equivalent text string on an Apple phone on the same day, it could have a wildly different meaning because of the font. This has already happened -- a few years ago Apple updated their font to have colored foot emojis, which sparked some controversy[1] because the version of the feet for black skin tones (incorrectly) depicted the sole of the foot as black. There was a thread on Twitter (can't find a link, sadly) where someone was confused by the posts talking about this because their Android phone's version of the emoji showed a side view of a foot instead of a bottom view. The original tweet was unintelligible to this reader because they were using a different font than the writer. One of the advantages of written language is that it's based on a discrete set of symbols that are used to form discrete words. This allows writing to last much longer than many other forms of communication. Emojis are a weird semi-discrete hybrid form of communication, which means they're bound to cause problems as time goes on.

I have a modest proposal: Anyone can use any emoji they want. To achieve this users declare emoji's in a known format the browser recognizes inline in text, which includes a content hash of the emoji they wish to use. eg. \":T15PXExNem0xX:\" Browsers use a DHT and local emoji datastore looking to the DHT to fetch any emoji's seen in text but not present locally. You may submit a picture to your browser to create an emoji, but it must be a 128x128 webp image. The browser calculates the hash, and puts it in your local datastore. You may now use this emoji anywhere. A few things to think through here: 1. Would be nice to have an non profit come forward and make a nice big server act as a reliable hub to the emoji database. The nice thing is, basically anyone can step forward at any time and provide servers to the network. Anyone can serve the emoji to anyone as they are addressed by their hash. 2. Regarding offensive or hateful emoji's, I think the question \"What if this is used to promote hate?\" Is a good question to be asking. But try to keep in mind that the system I am outlining is meant to be communication infrastructure, not a platform. Think of it like a different way to write text. This system in and of itself isn't a platform at all, as the only way to discover and use emoji's is to see someone use it somewhere else. You can browse your local datastore, but that's it. 3. What about REALLY hateful or outright illegal content? IPFS is a guiding light here (in more ways than one if people are familiar with the project). Lists can be made of Violating content by third party organizations and browsers could be configured to subscribe to those lists, very similar to the way ad blocking networks work. Apparatus could be constructed from there to support DMCA and abuse reports and distribute block lists. These subscription lists are user configurable, in case those apparatus are captured or abused and users feel the need to revolt. Likely more issues than this? I don't think there's anything that is insurmountable. But that's the rough outline. Instead of relying on the unicode consortium, take advantage of content hashing distribution networks to create user defined emoji's instead. I think about a system a lot when stuff like this comes up. Because I ask, what would be the most popular examples in such a database look like? Do we think it would be close to what the unicode consortium laid out? reply chrisco255 23 hours agoprevI grew up with the argument that video game violence causes real violence. At the time, conservatives were keen on censoring violence, blood and gore in movies, video games and TV shows. It was the liberal establishment that defended artistic violence and sexuality. Now it seems like the pendulum swung and liberals seem keen on promoting squirt gun emojis, meanwhile some of the most popular video games on the market are things like Call of Duty where you blast people away with automatic machine guns and sniper rifle head shots. It's very strange keeping up with the shifting tides of opinions about these sorts of things. reply paxys 23 hours agoparentEvery side is pro censorship, just when it suits them the most. Look at all the book bans across conservative states, for example. reply chrisco255 22 hours agorootparentThe book bans are only primary school libraries. I think this is fine, K-12 is mandatory, so clearly the state and local districts should have influence over what's allowed there. There's restrictions on religious teachings in school and likewise there should be limits on opinionated secular topics that don't advance reading, writing, and arithmetic skills. There's plenty of exposure to that stuff via other channels. reply paxys 22 hours agorootparentCensorship is censorship. The fact that it is happening in a government-run institution makes it worse. Like I said, everyone is for it when it suits them, and outraged when it doesn't. reply chrisco255 13 hours agorootparentNo, it's not censorship when an elementary school is selective about what material they teach kids. For example, I don't think violent video games like Call of Duty should be banned, but I also don't think kids should be playing Call of Duty in school computer labs. It's irrelevant to basic education. Discretion is obviously mandatory in order to focus students on subject material that expands their skills while not trying to convert them to Scientology or any other similar ideology. reply relaxing 20 hours agoparentprevIf you think about it, there’s a difference between a game you play in your home, and a font you use to communicate with others. reply chrisco255 13 hours agorootparentI'm sorry, is there some kind of difference between streaming a bloody match of Call of Duty on Twitch or YouTube and sending a gun emoji as a funny expression of sarcasm (which obviously doesn't mean the same with a squirt gun) to my friends or followers? It's silly that such dichotomies even exist. reply SpicyLemonZest 23 hours agoparentprevI'm not convinced this is a liberal vs. conservative thing in the first place. It seems like a straightforward continuation of the trend: depictions of violence are popular in some circles, yet disreputable in others, so big corporations looking to serve both markets have to find awkward, stodgy compromises to try and keep everyone happy. reply bluescrn 22 hours agorootparentIt's all pretty silly. We're arguing over a gun emoji on social media, where all sorts of horrific videos are posted, including real people getting shot by real guns. reply mindslight 22 hours agoparentprevIt's still conservatives, but conservatives from the culture that liberals ushered in over the past several decades. This explains the college campus dynamic as well, where all these professors that fought for liberal ideas in the 1970's and 1980's grew old and stopped questioning their own ideas. Now they're busy closing the ranks and tone policing anybody that pokes holes in their dogma. That dynamic isn't liberalism running amok, but rather just the bog standard pearl clutching of conservatism. Actual liberalism still exists, it just doesn't get media attention as pitting red tribe conservatism versus blue tribe conservatism creates more arguing (aka engagement). reply llm_trw 21 hours agorootparentZizek said it best: every culture war is today's conservatives fighting the conservatives of 30 years in the future. reply 34 more comments...

    "title": "My Favorite Algorithm: Linear Time Median Finding (2018)",
    "originLink": "https://rcoh.me/posts/linear-time-median-finding/",
    "originBody": "POSTS January 15, 2018 My Favorite Algorithm: Linear Time Median Finding Thanks to random internet strangers, you can also read this post in: Russian Finding the median in a list seems like a trivial problem, but doing so in linear time turns out to be tricky. In this post I’m going to walk through one of my favorite algorithms, the median-of-medians approach to find the median of a list in deterministic linear time. Although proving that this algorithm runs in linear time is a bit tricky, this post is targeted at readers with only a basic level of algorithmic analysis. Finding the median in O(n log n) The most straightforward way to find the median is to sort the list and just pick the median by its index. The fastest comparison-based sort is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), so that dominates the runtime.12 def nlogn_median(l): l = sorted(l) if len(l) % 2 == 1: return l[len(l) / 2] else: return 0.5 * (l[len(l) / 2 - 1] + l[len(l) / 2]) Although this method offers the simplest code, it’s certainly not the fastest. Finding the median in average O(n) Our next step will be to usually find the median within linear time, assuming we don’t get unlucky. This algorithm, called “quickselect”, was devevloped by Tony Hoare who also invented the similarly-named quicksort. It’s a recursive algorithm that can find any element (not just the median). Pick an index in the list. It doesn’t matter how you pick it, but choosing one at random works well in practice. The element at this index is called the pivot. Split the list into 2 groups: Elements less than or equal to the pivot, lesser_els Elements strictly greater than the pivot, great_els We know that one of these groups contains the median. Suppose we’re looking for the kth element: If there are k or more elements in lesser_els, recurse on list lesser_els, searching for the kth element. If there are fewer than k elements in lesser_els, recurse on list greater_els. Instead of searching for k, we search for k-len(lesser_els). Here’s an example of the algorithm running on a list with 11 elements: Consider the list below. We'd like to find the median. l = [9,1,0,2,3,4,6,8,7,10,5] len(l) == 11, so we're looking for the 6th smallest element First, we must pick a pivot. We randomly select index 3. The value at this index is 2. Partitioning based on the pivot: [1,0,2], [9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5] We want the 6th element. 6-len(left) = 3, so we want the third smallest element in the right array We're now looking for third smallest element in the array below: [9,3,4,6,8,7,10,5] We pick an index at random to be our pivot. We pick index 3, the value at which, l[3]=6 Partitioning based on the pivot: [3,4,5,6] [9,7,10] We want the 3rd smallest element, so we know it's the 3rd smallest element in the left array We're now looking for the 3rd smallest in the array below: [3,4,5,6] We pick an index at random to be our pivot. We pick index 1, the value at which, l[1]=4 Partitioning based on the pivot: [3,4] [5,6] We're looking for the item at index 3, so we know it's the smallest in the right array. We're now looking for the smallest element in the array below: [5,6] At this point, we can have a base case that chooses the larger or smaller item based on the index. We're looking for the smallest item, which is 5. return 5 To find the median with quickselect, we’ll extract quickselect as a separate function. Our quickselect_median function will call quickselect with the correct indices. import random def quickselect_median(l, pivot_fn=random.choice): if len(l) % 2 == 1: return quickselect(l, len(l) // 2, pivot_fn) else: return 0.5 * (quickselect(l, len(l) / 2 - 1, pivot_fn) + quickselect(l, len(l) / 2, pivot_fn)) def quickselect(l, k, pivot_fn): \"\"\" Select the kth element in l (0 based) :param l: List of numerics :param k: Index :param pivot_fn: Function to choose a pivot, defaults to random.choice :return: The kth element of l \"\"\" if len(l) == 1: assert k == 0 return l[0] pivot = pivot_fn(l) lows = [el for el in l if elpivot] pivots = [el for el in l if el == pivot] if k0 # If there are < 5 items, just return the median if len(l) < 5: # In this case, we fall back on the first median function we wrote. # Since we only run this on a list of 5 or fewer items, it doesn't # depend on the length of the input and can be considered constant # time. return nlogn_median(l) # First, we'll split `l` into groups of 5 items. O(n) chunks = chunked(l, 5) # For simplicity, we can drop any chunks that aren't full. O(n) full_chunks = [chunk for chunk in chunks if len(chunk) == 5] # Next, we sort each chunk.

To help, consider this visualization of our pivot-selection algorithm: The red oval denotes the medians of the chunks, and the center circle denotes the median-of-medians. Recall that we want our pivot to split the list as evenly as possible. Let’s consider the worst possible case – the case where are pivot is as close as possible to the beginning of the list (without loss of generality, this argument symmetrically applies to the end of the list as well.) Consider the four quadrants (which overlap, including the center column (when the number of columns is odd) & middle row): Top left: Every item in this quadrant is strictly less than the median Bottom left: These items may be bigger (or smaller!) than the median Top right: These items may be bigger (or smaller!) than the median Bottom right: Every item in this quadrant is strictly greater than the median Out of these four two quadrants are useful because they allow us to make assertions about their contents (top left, bottom right) and two are not (bottom left, top right). Now lets return to our original task, finding the worst possible case where our pivot falls as early in the list as possible. As I argued above, at a minimum, every item in the top left is strictly less than our pivot. How many items are there as a function of \\(n\\)? Each column has 5 items, of which we’ll take 3; we’re taking half of the columns, thus: $$f(n)=\\frac{3}{5}*\\frac{1}{2}n=\\frac{3}{10}n$$ Therefore, at each step, at minimum, we will remove, at minimum, 30% of the rows. But is dropping 30% of the elements at each step sufficient? It’s worse than the 50% we achieved in the randomized algorithm. At each step, our algorithm must do: O(n) work to partition the elements Solve 1 subproblem 1⁄5 the size of the original to compute the median of medians Solve 1 subproblem 7⁄10 the size of the original as the recursive step This yields the following equation for the total runtime, \\(T(n)\\): $$T(n)=n + T\\left(\\frac{n}{5}\\right)+T\\left(\\frac{7n}{10}\\right)$$ It’s not straightforward to prove why this is \\(O(n)\\). The initial version of this post alluded to the master theorem, but someone recently brought to my attention that that is incorrect – since there are two recursive terms, you can’t apply the master theorem. Rather, the only straightforward proof that I’m aware of is by induction.3 Recap We have quickselect, an algorithm that can find the median in linear time given a sufficiently good pivot. We have our median-of-medians algorithm, an \\(O(n)\\) algorithm to select a pivot (which is good enough for quickselect). Combining the two, we have an algorithm to find the median (or the nth element of a list) in linear time! Linear Time Medians In Practice In the real world, selecting a pivot at random is almost always sufficient. Although the median-of-medians approach is still linear time, it just takes too long to compute in practice. The C++ standard library uses an algorithm called introselect which utilizes a combination of heapselect and quickselect and has an \\(O(n \\log n)\\) bound. Introselect allows you to use a generally fast algorithm with a poor upper bound in combination with an algorithm that is slower in practice but has a good upper bound. Implementations start with the fast algorithm, but fall back to the slower algorithm if they’re unable to pick effective pivots. To finish out, here’s a comparison of the elements considered by each implementation. This isn’t runtime performance, but instead the total number of elements looked at by the quickselect function. It doesn’t count the work to compute the median-of-medians. The point of this graph is not to demonstrate that median-of-medians is a good algorithm, but rather to demonstrate that it’s an effective way to pick pivots. It’s exactly what you would expect! The deterministic pivot almost always considers fewer elements in quickselect than the random pivot. Sometimes we get lucky and guess the pivot on the first try, which manifests itself as dips in the green line. Math works! P.S: In 2017 a new paper came out that actually makes the median-of-medians approach competitive with other selection algorithms.

Another astute reader pointed out several errors which have since been resolved: The recurrence relation was \\(7T(n/10)\\) but should have been \\(T(7n/10))\\) The master theorem is actually inapplicable in this case I incorrectly referred to the top right, instead of top left quadrant in my arguments Want to get emailed about new blog posts?

    "commentBody": "My Favorite Algorithm: Linear Time Median Finding (2018) (rcoh.me)166 points by skanderbm 9 hours agohidepastfavorite101 comments rented_mule 1 hour ago10-15 years ago, I found myself needing to regularly find the median of many billions of values, each parsed out of a multi-kilobyte log entry. MapReduce was what we were using for processing large amounts of data at the time. With MapReduce over that much data, you don't just want linear time, but ideally single pass, distributed across machines. Subsequent passes over much smaller amounts of data are fine. It was a struggle until I figured out that knowledge of the precision and range of our data helped. These were timings, expressed in integer milliseconds. So they were non-negative, and I knew the 90th percentile was well under a second. As the article mentions, finding a median typically involves something akin to sorting. With the above knowledge, bucket sort becomes available, with a slight tweak in my case. Even if the samples were floating point, the same approach could be used as long as an integer (or even fixed point) approximation that is very close to the true median is good enough, again assuming a known, relatively small range. The idea is to build a dictionary where the keys are the timings in integer milliseconds and the values are a count of the keys' appearance in the data, i.e., a histogram of timings. The maximum timing isn't known, so to ensure the size of the dictionary doesn't get out of control, use the knowledge that the 90th percentile is well under a second and count everything over, say, 999ms in the 999ms bin. Then the dictionary will be limited to 2000 integers (keys in the range 0-999 and corresponding values) - this is the part that is different from an ordinary bucket sort. All of that is trivial to do in a single pass, even when distributed with MapReduce. Then it's easy to get the median from that dictionary / histogram. reply justinpombrio 55 minutes agoparentDid you actually need to find the true median of billions of values? Or would finding a value between 49.9% and 50.1% suffice? Because the latter is much easier: sample 10,000 elements uniformly at random and take their median. (I made the number 10,000 up, but you could do some statistics to figure out how many samples would be needed for a given level of confidence, and I don't think it would be prohibitively large.) reply andruby 33 minutes agorootparentI was thinking the same thing.

But the uncomfortable questions soon arise: Can I tolerate an approximate calculation? What assumptions about my data do I to determine an error bound? How to verify the validity of my assumptions on an ongoing basis? Personally I would gravitate towards the quickselect algorithm described in the OP until I was forced to consider a streaming median approximation method. reply skrtskrt 3 hours agorootparentA use case for something like this, and not just for medians, is where you have a querying/investigation UI like Grafana or Datadog or whatever. You write the query and the UI knows you're querying metric xyz_inflight_requests, it runs a preflight check to get the cardinality of that metric, and gives you a prompt: \"xyz_inflight_requests is a high-cardinality metric, this query may take some time - consider using estimated_median instead of median\". reply conradludgate 7 hours agorootparentprevWell, I believe you could use the streaming algorithms to pick the likely median, so help choose the pivot for the real quickselect. quickselect can be done inplace too which is O(1) memory if you can afford to rearrange the data. reply SkiFire13 4 hours agorootparentThen you don't get a guaranteed O(n) complexity if the approximated algorithm happen to make bad choices reply sevensor 6 hours agoparentprevI’ve definitely had situations where a streaming quantile algorithm would have been useful, do you have any references? reply fanf2 5 hours agorootparentThere are two kinds: - quantile sketches, such as t-digest, which aim to control the quantile error or rank error.

This one has a streaming variant. reply sevensor 5 hours agorootparentThanks!! reply ssfrr 2 hours agorootparentprevHere's a simple one I've used before. It's a variation on FAME (Fast Algorithm for Median Estimation) [1]. You keep an estimate for the current quantile value, and then for each element in your stream, you either increment (if the element is greater than your estimate) or decrement (if the element is less than your estimate) by fixed \"up -step\" and \"down-step\" amounts. If your increment and decrement steps are equal, you should converge to the median. If you shift the ratio of increment and decrement steps you can estimate any quantile. For example, say that your increment step is 0.05 and your decrement step is 0.95. When your estimate converges to a steady state, then you must be hitting greater values 95% of the time and lesser values 5% of the time, hence you've estimated the 95th percentile. The tricky bit is choosing the overall scale of your steps. If your steps are very small relative to the scale of your values, it will converge very slowly and not track changes in the stream. You don't want your steps to be too large because they determine the precision. The FAME algorithm has a step where you shrink your step size when your data value is near your estimate (causing the step size to auto-scale down).

What if we aren’t happy to be average, but instead want to guarantee that our algorithm is linear time, no matter what? I don't agree with the need for this guarantee. Note that the article already says the selection of the pivot is by random. You can simply choose a very good random function to avoid an attacker crafting an input that needs quadratic time. You'll never be unlucky enough for this to be a problem.

You don’t get to agree with it or not. It depends on the project! Clearly there exist some projects in the world where it’s important. But honestly it doesn’t matter. Because as the article shows with random data that median-of-medians is strictly better than random pivot. So even if you don’t need the requirement there is zero loss to achieve it. reply kccqzy 1 hour agorootparentThe median-of-median comes at a cost for execution time. Chances are, sorting each five-element chunk is a lot slower than even running a sophisticated random number generator. reply anonymoushn 8 hours agoprevOne commonly sees the implication that radix sort cannot be used for data types other than integers, or for composite data types, or for large data types. For example, TFA says you could use radix sort if your input is 32-bit integers. But you can use it on anything. You can use radix sort to sort strings in O(n) time. reply contravariant 8 hours agoparentIt should also be noted that radix sort is ridiculously fast because it just scans linearly through the list each time. It's actually hard to come up with something that cannot be sorted lexicographically. The best example I was able to find was big fractions. Though even then you could write them as continued fractions and sort those lexicographically (would be a bit trickier than strings). reply anonymoushn 6 hours agorootparentSorting fractions by numerical value is a good example. Previously I've heard that there are some standard collation schemes for some human languages that resist radix sort, but when I asked about which ones in specific I didn't hear back :( reply contravariant 4 hours agorootparentThe Unicode Collation algorithm doesn't look fun to implement in radix sort, but not entirely impossible either. They do note that some characters are contextual, an example they give is that CH can be treated as a single character that sorts after C (so also after CZ). Technically that is still lexicographical, but not byte-for-byte. reply exDM69 8 hours agoparentprevProblem with radix sorting strings is that it is O(k*N) where k is length of key, in this case it's the second longest string's length. Additional problems arise if you are dealing with null terminated strings and do not have the length stored. Radix sort is awesome if k is small, N is huge and/or you are using a GPU. On a CPU, comparison based sorting is faster in most cases. reply anonymoushn 8 hours agorootparentNo, it's O(N+M) where N is the number of strings and M is the sum of the lengths of the strings. Maybe your radix sort has some problems? I evaluated various sorts for strings as part of my winning submission to https://easyperf.net/blog/2022/05/28/Performance-analysis-an... and found https://github.com/bingmann/parallel-string-sorting to be helpful. For a single core, the fastest implementation among those in parallel-string-sorting was a radix sort, so my submission included a radix sort based on that one. The only other contender was multi-key quicksort, which is notably not a comparison sort (i.e. a general-purpose string comparison function is not used as a subroutine of multi-key quicksort). In either case, you end up operating on something like an array of structs containing a pointer to the string, an integer offset into the string, and a few cached bytes from the string, and in either case I don't really know what problems you expect to have if you're dealing with null-terminated strings. A very similar similar radix sort is included in https://github.com/alichraghi/zort which includes some benchmarks, but I haven't done the work to have it work on strings or arbitrary structs. reply Aardwolf 6 hours agorootparent> No, it's O(N+M) where N is the number of strings and M is the sum of the lengths of the strings. That would mean it's possible to sort N random 64-bit integers in O(N+M) which is just O(N) with a constant factor of 9 (if taking the length in bytes) or 65 (if taking the length in bits), so sort billions of random integers in linear time, is that truly right? EDIT: I think it does make sense, M is length*N, and in scenarios where this matters this length will be in the order of log(N) anyway so it's still NlogN-sh. reply anonymoushn 6 hours agorootparent> That would mean it's possible to sort N random 64-bit integers in O(N+M) which is just O(N) with a constant factor of 9 (if taking the length in bytes) or 65 (if taking the length in bits), so sort billions of random integers in linear time, is that truly right? Yes. You can sort just about anything in linear time. > EDIT: I think it does make sense, M is length*N, and in scenarios where this matters this length will be in the order of log(N) anyway so it's still NlogN-sh. I mainly wrote N+M rather than M to be pedantically correct for degenerate inputs that consist of mostly empty strings. Regardless, if you consider the size of the whole input, it's linear in that. reply exDM69 5 hours agorootparentprevYes, radix sort can sort integers in linear O(N) time. reply dataflow 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you have a million 1-character strings and one string of length 1 million, how many steps would your LSD radix sort take? And (if it's indeed linear in the total input size like you say) how do you make it jump over the empty slots without losing real-world efficiency in other cases? reply anonymoushn 5 hours agorootparentIt's MSB radix sort. I think LSB radix sort is not generally as useful because even for fixed-size inputs it often makes more passes over most of the input than MSB radix sort. Your comment makes me think it would be swell to add a fast path for when the input range compares equal for the current byte or bytes though. In general radix sorts have some computation to spare (on commonly used CPUs, more computation may be performed per element during the histogramming pass without spending any additional time). Some cutting-edge radix sorts spend this spare computation to look for sorted subsequences, etc. reply dataflow 5 hours agorootparentOh I see. I've found LSD better in some cases, but maybe it's just my implementation. For MSD, do you get a performance hit from putting your stack on the heap (to avoid overflow on recursion)? I don't just mean the minor register vs. memory differences in the codegen, but also the cache misses & memory pressure due to potentially long input elements (and thus correspondingly large stack to manage). > Some cutting-edge radix sorts Where do you find these? :-) reply anonymoushn 4 hours agorootparent> For MSD, do you get a performance hit from putting your stack on the heap (to avoid overflow on recursion)? I'm not sure. My original C++ implementation which is for non-adversarial inputs puts the array containing histograms and indices on the heap but uses the stack for a handful of locals, so it would explode if you passed the wrong thing. The sort it's based on in the parallel-string-sorting repo works the same way. Oops! > cache misses & memory pressure due to potentially long input elements (and thus correspondingly large stack) I think this should be okay? The best of these sorts try to visit the actual strings infrequently. You'd achieve worst-case cache performance by passing a pretty large number of strings with a long, equal prefix. Ideally these strings would share the bottom ~16 bits of their address, so that they could evict each other from cache when you access them.

Therefore, each subsequent recursion operates on 1⁄2 the data of the previous step.” That “therefore” doesn’t follow, so this is more an intuition than a proof. The problem with it is that the medium is more likely to end up in the larger of the two pieces, so you more likely have to recurse on the larger part than on the smaller part. What saves you is that O(n) doesn’t say anything about constants. Also, I would think you can improve things a bit for real world data by, on subsequent iterations, using the average of the set as pivot (You can compute that for both pieces on the fly while doing the splitting. The average may not be in the set of items, but that doesn’t matter for this algorithm). Is that true? reply meatmanek 3 minutes agoparentIf I'm understanding correctly, the median is actually guaranteed to be in the larger of the two pieces of the array after partitioning. That means on average you'd only discard 25% of the array after each partition. Your selected pivot is either below the median, above the median, or exactly the median. If it's below the median, it could be anywhere in the range [p0, p50) for an average of around p25; if it's above the median, it could be anywhere in the range (p50, p100] for an average of around p75. Since these remaining fractions combine multiplicatively, we actually care about the geometric mean of the remaining fraction of the array, which is e^[(integral of ln(x) dx from x=0.5 to x=1) / (1 - 0.5)], or about 73.5%. Regardless, it forms a geometric series, which should converge to 1/(1-0.735) or about 3.77. Regarding using the average as the pivot: the question is really what quantile would be equal to the mean for your distribution. Heavily skewed distributions would perform pretty badly. It would perform particularly badly on 0.01*np.arange(1, 100) -- for each partitioning step, the mean would land between the first element and the second element. reply zelphirkalt 5 hours agoprevYou can simply pass once over the data, and while you do that, count occurrences of the elements, memorizing the last maximum. Whenever an element is counted, you check, if that count is now higher than the previous maximum. If it is, you memorize the element and its count as the maximum, of course. Very simple approach and linear in time, with minimal book keeping on the way (only the median element and the count (previous max)). I don't find it surprising or special at all, that finding the median works in linear time, since even this ad-hoc thought of way is in linear time. EDIT: Ah right, I mixed up mode and median. My bad. reply gcr 5 hours agoparentThis finds the mode (most common element), not the median. Wouldn't you also need to keep track of all element counts with your approach? You can't keep the count of only the second-most-common element because you don't know what that is yet. reply zelphirkalt 4 hours agorootparentYes, you are right. I mixed up mode and median. And yes, one would need to keep track of at least a key for each element (not a huge element, if they are somehow huge). But that would be about space complexity. reply gcr 4 hours agorootparentpardon! it's fun to think about though! reply throwaway294531 3 hours agoprevIf you're selecting the n:th element, where n is very small (or large), using median-of-medians may not be the best choice. Instead, you can use a biased pivot as in [1] or something I call \"j:th of k:th\". Floyd-Rivest can also speed things up. I have a hobby project that gets 1.2-2.0x throughput when compared to a well implemented quickselect, see: https://github.com/koskinev/turboselect If anyone has pointers to fast generic & in-place selection algorithms, I'm interested. [1] https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SEA.2017.24 reply Xcelerate 7 hours agoprevI received a variant of this problem as an interview question a few months ago. Except the linear time approach would not have worked here, since the list contains trillions of numbers, you only have sequential read access, and the list cannot be loaded into memory. 30 minutes — go. First I asked if anything could be assumed about the statistics on the distribution of the numbers. Nope, could be anything, except the numbers are 32-bit ints. After fiddling around for a bit I finally decided on a scheme that creates a bounding interval for the unknown median value (one variable contains the upper bound and one contains the lower bound based on 2^32 possible values) and then adjusts this interval on each successive pass through the data. The last step is to average the upper and lower bound in case there are an odd number of integers. Worst case, this approach requires O(log n) passes through the data, so even for trillions of numbers it’s fairly quick. I wrapped up the solution right at the time limit, and my code ran fine on the test cases. Was decently proud of myself for getting a solution in the allotted time. Well, the interview feedback arrived, and it turns out my solution was rejected for being suboptimal. Apparently there is a more efficient approach that utilizes priority heaps. After looking up and reading about the priority heap approach, all I can say is that I didn’t realize the interview task was to re-implement someone’s PhD thesis in 30 minutes... I had never used leetcode before because I never had difficulty with prior coding interviews (my last job search was many years before the 2022 layoffs), but after this interview, I immediately signed up for a subscription. And of course the “median file integer” question I received is one of the most asked questions on the list of “hard” problems. reply pfdietz 7 hours agoparentYou don't need to load trillions of numbers into memory, you just need to count how many of each number there are. This requires 2^32 words of memory, not trillions of words. After doing that just scan down the array of counts, summing, until you find the midpoint. reply Xcelerate 7 hours agorootparentYeah, I thought of that actually, but the interviewer said “very little memory” at one point which gave me the impression that perhaps I only had some registers available to work with. Was this an algorithm for an embedded system? The whole problem was kind of miscommunicated, because the interviewer showed up 10 minutes late, picked a problem from a list, and the requirements for the problem were only revealed when I started going a direction the interviewer wasn’t looking for (“Oh, the file is actually read-only.” “Oh, each number in the file is an integer, not a float.”) reply jagged-chisel 6 hours agorootparentThat “miscommunication” you mention has been used against me in several interviews, because I was expected to ask questions (and sometimes a specific question they had in mind) before making assumptions.

But I need clarity on which skill they want to test in thirty minutes. reply creata 5 hours agorootparentprevWith 256 counters, you could use the same approach with four passes: pass i bins the numbers by byte i (0 = most sig., 3 = least sig.) and then identifies the bin that contains the median. I really want to know what a one-pass, low-memory solution looks like, lol. reply pfdietz 3 hours agorootparentPerhaps the interviewer was looking for an argument that no such solution can exist? The counterargument would look like this: divide the N numbers into two halves, each N/2 numbers. Now, suppose you don't have enough memory to represent the first N/2 numbers (ignoring changes in ordering); in that case, two different bags of numbers will have the same representation in memory. One can now construct a second half of numbers for which the algorithm will get the wrong answer for at least one of the two colliding cases. This is assuming a deterministic algorithm; maybe a random algorithm could work with high probability and less memory? reply anonymoushn 7 hours agoparentprevDo you mean topK rather than median, for K small?

The key part for me isn't > there might be an even faster linear algorithm, but > it's possible to do selection of an unsorted list in O(n) time. At one point, we didn't know whether that was even possible. For me, the moment of clarity was understanding that theoretical CS mainly cares about problems, not algorithms. Algorithms are tools to prove upper bounds on the complexity of problems. Lower bounds are equally important and cannot be proved by designing algorithms. We even see theorems of the form \"there exists an O(whatever) algorithm for \": the algorithm's existence can sometimes be proven non-constructively. So if the median problem sat for a long time with a linear lower bound and superlinear upper bound, we might start to wonder if the problem has a superlinear lower bound, and spend our effort working on that instead. The existence of a linear-time algorithm immediately closes that path. The only remaining work is to tighten the constant factor. The community's effort can be focused. A famous example is the linear programming problem. Klee and Minty proved an exponential worst case for the simplex algorithm, but not for linear programming itself. Later, Khachiyan proved that the ellipsoid algorithm was polynomial-time, but it had huge constant factors and was useless in practice. However, a few years later, Karmarkar gave an efficient polynomial-time algorithm. One can imagine how Khachiyan's work, although inefficient, could motivate a more intense focus on polynomial-time LP algorithms leading to Karmarkar's breakthrough. reply anonymoushn 5 hours agorootparentprevIf you had two problems, and a linear time solution was known to exist for only one of them, I think it would be reasonable to say that it's more likely that a practical linear time solution exists for that one than for the other one. reply ValleZ 6 hours agoprevI was asked to invent this algorithm on a whiteboard in 30 minutes.

Why would you use a float as an array index instead of doing integer division (with `//`)? I know this probably won't matter until you have extremely large arrays, but this is still quite a code smell. Perhaps this could be forgiven if you're a Python novice and hadn't realized that the two different operators exist, but this is not the case here, as the article contains this even more baffling code which uses integer division in one branch but float division in the other: def quickselect_median(l, pivot_fn=random.choice): if len(l) % 2 == 1: return quickselect(l, len(l) // 2, pivot_fn) else: return 0.5 * (quickselect(l, len(l) / 2 - 1, pivot_fn) + quickselect(l, len(l) / 2, pivot_fn)) That we're 50 comments in and nobody seems to have noticed this only serves to reinforce my existing prejudice against the average Python code quality. reply jononor 48 minutes agoparentWell spotted!

However given that this is an algorithms article I don't think it is exactly that fair to judge it based on code quality.

Very short variable names (including \"ns\" and \"n\") are always some kind of disturbance when reading code, especially when the variable lasts longer than one screen of code – one has to memorize the meaning. They sometimes have a point, e.g. in mathematical code like this one. But variables like \"l\" and \"O\" are bad for a further reason, as they can not easily be distinguished from the numbers.

Except that there is no such thing as \"arbitrarily large storage\", as my link in the parent comment explained: https://hbfs.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/to-boil-the-oceans/ So why would you want to talk about arbitrarily large input (where the input is an array that is stored in memory)? As I understood, this big-O notation is intended to have some real-world usefulness, is it not? Care to elaborate what that usefulness is, exactly? Or is it just a purely fictional notion in the realm of ideas with no real-world application? And if so, why bother studying it at all, except as a mathematical curiosity written in some mathematical pseudo-code rather than a programming or engineering challenge written in a real-world programming language? Edit: s/pretending/intended/ reply fenomas 3 hours agorootparentBig-O analysis is about scaling behavior - its real-world implications lie in what it tells you about relative sizes, not absolute sizes. E.g., if you need to run a task on 10M inputs, then knowing that your algorithm is O(N) doesn't tell you anything at all about how long your task will take. It also doesn't tell you whether that algorithm will be faster than some other algorithm that's O(N^2). But it does tell you that if your task size doubles to 20M inputs, you can expect the time required for the first algorithm to double, and the second to quadruple. And that knowledge isn't arcane or theoretical, it works on real-world hardware and is really useful for modeling how your code will run as inputs scale up. reply raincole 3 hours agorootparentprev> (where the input is an array that is stored in memory)? If the input is an array that is stored in a piece of real-world memory, then the only possible complexity is O(1). It's just how big-O works. Big-O notation is an abstraction that is much much closer to mathematics than to engineering. > this big-O notation is pretending to have some real-world usefulness... Big-O notation is not a person so I'm not sure whether it can pretend something. CS professors might exaggerate big-O notation's real-world usefulness so their students don't fall asleep too fast. > fictional Theoretical. Just like the other theoretical ideas, at best big-O notation gives some vague insights that help people solve real problems. It gives a very rough feeling about whether an algorithm is fast or not. By the way, Turing machine is in this category as well. reply SkiFire13 4 hours agoparentprev [–] Ultimately when an algorithm has worse complexity than another it might still be faster up to a certain point. In this case 5 is likely under that point, though I doubt 2^256 will. In practice you might also want to use a O(n^2) algorithm like insertion sort under some threshold. reply someplaceguy 4 hours agorootparent [–] > Ultimately when an algorithm has worse complexity than another it might still be faster up to a certain point. Sure, but the author didn't argue that the simpler algorithm would be faster for 5 items, which would indeed make sense. Instead, the author argued that it's OK to use the simpler algorithm for less than 5 items because 5 is a constant and therefore the simpler algorithm runs in constant time, hence my point that you could use the same argument to say that 2^140 (or 2^256) could just as well be used as the cut-off point and similarly argue that the simpler algorithm runs in constant time for all arrays than can be represented on a real-world computer, therefore obviating the need for the more complex algorithm (which obviously makes no sense). reply thrw2486776 3 hours agorootparent [–] If you set n=2^140, then sure, it’s constant. If instead you only have n In the article n was set to 5. All of those arrays (except maybe 1) have exactly 5 elements. There is no variance No, the code was: # If there areand even if there was, it would be tiny, there is no point in talking about limits of 5-element sequences So your point is: not all constants are created equal.

In that way, they remind me of Apple with Sherlock way back in the early 2000s. Despite this, I was doubtful that they'd go so far as to release a full-on search product due to their relationship with MSFT and reliance on Azure credits. I am happy to admit that I have long stopped any attempt to properly understand how OpenAI's corporate governance and company structure work, so I have a hard time following where this falls under and who would decide on this release, as well as how they interact with the part of OpenAI cooperating with MSFT and the Bing team, but I still have a hard time seeing how releasing a clear Bing competitor wouldn't cause some trouble for their entire suite of products and maybe even hinder future expansion by limiting the resources they can rely upon. I am also interested in how this will impact search in https://chatgpt.com/, which, like everything in that product, has been inconsistent to a maddening extent. Started out barely usable, failing consistently, then got reliable whilst retaining the ability to search through multiple sites and handle more than one request in a row, then lost most of those capabilities and now barely works anymore, only looking at an incredibly limited, often barely fitting selection of results, whilst also needing to be manually invoked by asking for a search, rather than before when that was done automatically whenever it seemed sensible. Like so many changes, e.g. the subjective reduction in GPT-4's abilities over time whilst retaining the model's name (not to mention the regressions they publicized in the name of efficiency, like the \"turbo\" variants), this is certainly done to reduce costs to the point of finally becoming financially viable at the $20,- price they charge for ChatGPT+. I might be in the minority, but I will continue to scream from the rooftops that I am more than willing to pay far more for a consistent, guaranteed, high-end LLM with web access (which sadly excludes Anthropic's efforts). [0] I still dislike using that term for companies solely relying on third-party API's, a frontend and database solution, especially since I also detest calling LLM's \"AI\", but it's what this crop of companies have been termed and how they collected bucket loads of VC. reply nsilvestri 34 minutes agoprevI have never felt like my searches in other engines have been helped by AI.

The problem moving forward: how do we keep information-based websites in business so that AI can scrape them? There's a real risk of AI eating its own seed corn here.

    "originLink": "https://tn1ck.com/blog/how-to-generate-sudokus",
    "originBody": "Generating sudokus for fun and no profit 2024-06-25• By Tom Nick Once upon a time, I decided to create a complete Sudoku application as my grandma wanted to play some Sudokus on her computer, and I wasn't satisfied with the free offers available. The project went on for some years and finally led to sudoku.tn1ck.com - a free and open source Sudoku app without any tracking. While working on it, I went down the rabbit hole of generating Sudokus of a specified \"human perceived\" difficulty and accidentally created a quite thorough analysis of it. Creating a Sudoku solver First things first, to generate a Sudoku, we first have to solve one. The solver plays an integral part in the generation part, as we will use the iterations it needed to solve a Sudoku to measure the difficulty. We will explore multiple algorithms and benchmark them against each other in how well we can use them to measure the difficulty of a Sudoku. We start with the most basic brute force algorithm and end up with the final one, based on seeing the Sudoku as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (short CSP). We use a depth-first search (short DFS) for all our different strategies here. We abstract this by the following function. We make it Sudoku specific instead of completely generic for ease of use.1 + Code of the depth-first search Brute force version Brute force version This is the most simple strategy to solve the Sudoku: We find an empty spot and fill in a number between 1 - 9. We don’t do anything else. This is horribly slow; do not try this at home. Easy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku SolveResetStep Time between each step (ms) Iterations: 0 Stack size: 1 1 6 7 4 8 9 7 2 6 3 8 2 8 7 6 1 4 3 6 9 2 1 8 6 2 3 5 2 4 8 1 6 5 7 + Code of the brute force strategy Skip on invalid Sudokus Skip on invalid Sudokus The simplest and most substantial change we can do is not waiting until the whole Sudoku is filled but skipping on the Sudokus that are already invalid. This solver will solve even the hardest Sudokus in adequate time, but it still wastes a lot of cycles as it is not choosing the cell to fill with a value with any strategy. Easy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku SolveResetStep Time between each step (ms) Iterations: 0 Stack size: 1 1 6 7 4 8 9 7 2 6 3 8 2 8 7 6 1 4 3 6 9 2 1 8 6 2 3 5 2 4 8 1 6 5 7 + Code of the improved brute force Minimum remaining value Minimum remaining value \"Minimum remaining value\" is a heuristic we can use to not search blindly, but to select the cell next with the least amount of possibilities. This is something a human would do as well - fill or work on the cells with the least options. This greatly reduces the number of iterations needed for the difficult Sudoku. This algorithm is pretty solid now as it can solve even the hardest Sudokus in the millisecond range. Easy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku SolveResetStep Time between each step (ms) Iterations: 0 Stack size: 1 1 6 7 4 8 9 7 2 6 3 8 2 8 7 6 1 4 3 6 9 2 1 8 6 2 3 5 2 4 8 1 6 5 7 + Code of the minimum remaining value strategy Arc Consistency Arc Consistency We now embark on a different way to solve the Sudoku, namely framing it as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem to solve it and then use Arc Consistency to simplify the problem. A quick primer on some computer science terms. Domain - A domain is the set of possible values for a variable. For a Sudoku, this is the numbers 1 - 9. CSP - A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a problem defined by a set of variables, a set of domains, and a set of constraints. The goal is to assign a value to each variable such that the constraints are satisfied. For a Sudoku, the variables are the cells, the domains are the numbers 1 - 9, and the constraints are that every row, column, and square has to have unique numbers. Arc consistency - A variable is arc-consistent with another variable if every value in the domain of the first variable has a possible value in the domain of the second variable that satisfies the constraint between the two variables. In the Sudoku example, if we have two cells in the same row, one with the domain [1, 2, 3] and the other with the domain [2], this is not arc consistent as 2 is in the domain of the first cell. If we remove the 2 from the domain of the first cell, it becomes arc consistent. AC3 - The AC3 algorithm is an algorithm to create arc consistency. The main difference from the complete naive way to achieve arc consistency is that we do not loop over all constraints again when a domain of a variable changes, but only the relevant variables that have a constraint with it (in Sudoku the cells in the same row/column/square). For every cell in the Sudoku, we keep track of its possible values. We reduce the possible values for every cell by checking the Sudoku constraints e.g. remove the numbers that are already in the same row/column/square. We do this as long until no domain is changing anymore. This \"reduction of domains using the constraints\" is arc consistency. For very simple Sudokus, this is already enough to solve one (see the applet below), for harder ones, we are left with multiple options for every unfilled cell. This means we have to employ a search again. We use then the \"Minimum remaining value\" strategy again to select the cell with the least options and create new versions of the Sudoku with that cell filled with the possible values. This is called \"domain splitting\" in fancy computer science terms. We again count the number of iterations needed to solve the Sudoku. The applet shows the domains of the applied AC3 algorithm in unfilled cells. If a Sudoku cannot be solved, one domain will become empty, which is shown as red, then the algorithm will backtrack. Easy sudokuMedium sudokuHard sudokuEvil sudoku SolveResetStep Time between each step (ms) Iterations: 0 Stack size: 1 1 6 7 4 8 9 7 2 6 3 8 2 8 7 6 1 4 3 6 9 2 1 8 6 2 3 5 2 4 8 1 6 5 7 + Code of the Arc consistency strategy Rating the difficulty of Sudokus The main problem that one faces when generating a Sudoku is to assign the difficulty rating for a human solver. As we don’t want to manually verify every Sudoku we generate, we need an automatic way for us to group a newly generated Sudoku according to its difficulty. All our Sudoku solvers yield an iteration count, which we will use as our cost function. I'm relying here on the paper \"Rating and generating Sudoku puzzles based on constraint satisfaction problems.\" by Fatemi, Bahare, Seyed Mehran Kazemi, and Nazanin Mehrasa.2 In the paper, they download Sudokus of each difficulty section from websudoku.com, solve them by students volunteers, and then run their algorithm on it. They then took the average of each category and so they got an iteration-to-difficulty mapping. We will do basically the same, but actually publish the data and also try out how the \"lesser\" strategies work here for rating the difficulty. I fetched 100 Sudokus from websudoku.com (easy, medium, hard, evil) for each of its difficulty classes as well as from sudoku.com (easy, medium, hard, expert, master, extreme). How well do the solvers measure human difficulty? I'm not a data scientist, so take this analysis with a grain of salt, and I'm happy for any comments/proposals on how to improve it. As I don't have comments here yet, you can open an issue at the GitHub repository of this analysis instead. This is the raw data on how many iterations each solver took to solve the Sudokus. You can also execute it yourself here or look at the source at GitHub. I skipped the most simple brute force, as it would take ages to compute even medium difficult Sudokus. For all the charts, I used the logarithm on the iterations as especially the qq plot made it very obvious that the iterations count is exponential to the difficulty. Which is not surprising as solving Sudokus is famously NP hard. Any currently known algorithms to solve an NP-hard problem take exponential time. Histograms Histograms First let's draw a histogram of each strategy and each dataset to get an idea of the distribution. From that, we can see that they seem to be more or less normally distributed (with the applied logarithm), especially the brute force algorithm. Both the minimum remaining value and arc consistency algorithm look the same, but only for the more difficult levels as for the easy ones, they always need the same number of iterations. Brute Force w. skipMinimum Remaining ValueArc Consistency QQ plots QQ plots Then we look at the QQ plots for each strategy/source/level combination. QQ plots are super cool to get an intuitive understanding of how the values are distributed. A perfect normal distribution would be a straight line. These lines also look pretty straight, but only because we used the logarithm on the iterations count already. For the minimum remaining value and arc consistency, the lower difficulty levels look much less like a straight line, but the higher difficulty levels look very much like it. This is explained with their very low iteration count for the easy Sudokus. Brute Force w. skipMinimum Remaining ValueArc Consistency Correlation Correlation We can already see that these graphs all look somewhat alike, even the second most basic brute force looks decently similar to our fancy CSP algorithm. But do the numbers agree? How much do the iterations correlate with the level? Brute Force w. skipMinimum Remaining ValueArc Consistency As we can see, they all correlate almost perfectly with the brute force having a perfect 1.0 correlation, making it highly likely that the websites use the iteration count as well for their level determination - and this makes the whole analysis problematic, as we still don't know if this is actually a good difficulty indicator for how a human perceives the difficulty. Actually solving Sudokus by a human and rating them by the time to get a ground truth is left as an exercise for the reader (Sorry I'm not paid for this.) Generating a Sudoku with a specific difficulty Generating a Sudoku with a specific difficulty To now generate a Sudoku of a specific difficulty, we do the following: Start with an empty grid and fill it with random numbers until it is a valid (and unique) Sudoku. We backtrack when the added number will lead to a non-solvable Sudoku. Note: The uniqueness constraint comes automatically as we continue to fill the Sudoku with numbers. Instead of stopping when it is unique, we could also stop when it is fully filled, but that wouldn't be helpful as we would have to delete numbers again in the next step. To generate a Sudoku of a wanted difficulty, we either remove numbers or add numbers until the reached difficulty is achieved. If we cannot delete any more numbers without making it non-unique, meaning we reached max difficulty, but the difficulty is below the requested one, start at 1 again. Note: We could also backtrack or add numbers again, but for my personal use, I found it better to save the Sudoku with the maximum achieved difficulty and start over, but by adding and removing numbers, one could theoretically reach the requested difficulty. If the call count is close to the requested value, return the Sudoku. As point 3 points out, generating very difficult Sudokus can take quite some time as any generation method will struggle with the uniqueness constraint and has to randomly alter the Sudoku generation steps. Here is an applet for you to interactively run the Sudoku.

Here is how they describe the algorithm: \"We use hill climbing to generate new puzzles having a call count close to the call count we need. In this method, first of all, we generate an initial puzzle with some random numbers inside it and calculate its cost function. Then in each iteration, we randomly change one element of this solution by adding, deleting, or changing a single number and calculate the cost function again. After this, we check the new value of the cost function for this new puzzle and compare it to the previous one. If the cost is reduced, we accept the second puzzle as the new solution and otherwise, we undo the change. We do this process until meeting the stopping criterion. The cost function for a given puzzle is infinity for puzzles with none or more than one solution. For other puzzles, the cost is the absolute value of the current puzzle’s call count minus the average call count of the given difficulty level. For example, if we want to generate an easy puzzle and we want to consider the values demonstrated in Table I, then the cost function for a puzzle having a unique solution is the absolute value of its call count minus 6.234043. We stop the algorithm when we have puzzles with costs close to zero. Depending on the level of accuracy we need and the number of difficulty levels we have, we can define the closeness of the cost function to zero.\" When I first read it, I thought \"we generate an initial puzzle with some random numbers inside it\" would mean that I could literally start with a Sudoku grid and put random numbers in it. But one needs an already valid Sudoku as else the hill climbing will not work as the cost function for an invalid configuration should return infinite. While theoretically it still works, it takes far too long to stumble upon a valid configuration like this. I’m not entirely sure if they meant to start with a valid Sudoku, but \"initial puzzle with some random numbers\" does not sound like it. Furthermore, \"just adding, deleting, or changing a single number\" is not efficient, as again, this can lead to an invalid configuration quickly, albeit the hill climbing will take care of that if you were in a valid configuration before. I find my algorithm to be more efficient and elegant as it is guided by the Sudoku's constraints, namely we first create a solvable and unique Sudoku, making the hill climbing afterwards easier as our cost function will not return infinity. Their algorithm will spend most of their time trying to stumble upon a valid Sudoku.

The puzzles are all handmade, and many of them have some specific reason to exist: e.g. there's at least one which is clearly intended to teach you the swordfish pattern, and there are a few which appear to be built around some beautiful one-off ideas. reply 0xFF0123 6 hours agoparentCracking the cryptic is fantastic. The beauty in the setting of some of their showcased puzzles is truly wonderful to watch get solved. reply Skeime 5 hours agorootparentAnd it is such a fantastic resource to learn! You want to get into puzzles like they do on the channel? Just open a video, pause it, and click the link in the description. Stare at the puzzle, trying to figure it out. The first time you do this, you probably won't. Once you lose patience (but give yourself some time!), watch the video until Simon or Mark get to the first deduction and explain it. Pause the video again, and try to continue using your new knowledge. When you get stuck again, what (or skim) through the video until they do enter a deduction that you have not found. Rinse and repeat. Do this a couple of times with different videos, and you will start to build a repertoire of techniques yourself. At some point, you will be capable of solving puzzles on your own. (And if you get stuck, the video is there to help you.) reply CamelCaseName 1 hour agorootparentVery reminiscent of agadmator and his chess videos, but without the app reply ziml77 5 hours agorootparentprevI love the feeling of finding the beauty of how a puzzle resolves.

I really like the way you present information, especially with the interactive examples. I've been playing a lot with the logic programming language, Prolog. Sudoku is a popular \"hello world\" for it. If you haven't used Prolog before, here's an example of a Sudoku solver. It uses Prolog's Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains library -- CLP(FD) -- a form of CSP. https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/clpfd_sudoku.pl The relation on line 8 basically encodes the rules of Sudoku verbatim. Logic programming is cool (at least to me) because relations can be run in any direction with any number of variables. I wonder how writing a Sudoku puzzle generator would differ in a language that had first-class support for CSP. reply moffkalast 1 hour agoparentprevHey well if you insist, I did find something weird: numpad number entry doesn't work. reply jmull 2 hours agoprevI've found the best way to rate and generate puzzles of a certain perceived difficulty is to have a solver that works the way a human does. So if you have a puzzle that can be solved using only techniques that interested people can come up with fairly readily/intuitively and apply without a lot of ceremony, then that would be, perhaps, very easy. The more advanced techniques (for humans) needed to solve the puzzle, the harder it would be rated. You can also feed these techniques into the generation so that you can guide the difficulty as it's being generated (the way I did it, I found it would still fall into puzzles that are easier than the target, or get stuck on puzzles that are too hard, but applying adjustments to backtracking and forward progress based on heuristics observed in \"stuck\" scenarios seemed to do the trick. reply ball_of_lint 29 minutes agoparentThe author calls this out specifically: > and this makes the whole analysis problematic, as we still don't know if this is actually a good difficulty indicator for how a human perceives the difficulty reply thih9 6 hours agoprevI love the first sentence, peak hacking spirit. > Once upon a time I decided to create a complete sudoku application as my grandma wanted to play some sudokus on her computer and I wasn't satisfied with the free offers available.

I really like creating interactive articles, they can help so much with understanding, https://ciechanow.ski/ articles are the perfect example of this.

I do fear for my less technical relatives becoming a target of a predatory app that should be free. Would be nice to quickly find good solutions.

Tech stack is literally just a Next.js website and I write my articles in React. I tried other things before e.g. Jekyll, but I found that dynamic content is really hard to do there, annoyingly hard. I keep it super simple and don't do \"the proper way\" of things at times (e.g. the blog index is manually done by me). But that keeps it simple & independent to me. Next.js here is just a detail, I can always move to some other React-based static site generator. It's hosted at Cloudflare.

Are there more things like this, or is Motif to be blamed for the general bloat in Netscape?\" A: \"Yes, there are a bunch of easter eggs in Mozilla; so? By and large they're pretty small, but that doesn't really matter, because they serve a very important purpose: first, they're entertaining to find (I love it when I stumble across them in other programs, and judging by the amount of mail I get about these things, so do a lot of other people.) Programs should be fun to use. But by far their most important reason for existing is that they are fun to write. Hackers get a kick out of puzzles, and you know what? If dropping in an easter egg allows a hacker to blow off some steam and consequently stick around the office for a few hours longer, and put in a 20 hour day instead of merely a 16 hour day, then those are resources well spent. The hacker's happy at having been creative; somewhere down the road, some users will be amused by it; and the program ships faster, and is a better program because the people who wrote it cared about it. Everybody wins. Yes, such toys are \"unprofessional.\" I wear my unprofessionalism as a badge of honor. Professionalism has no place in art, and hacking is art. Software Engineering might be science; but that's not what I do. I'm a hacker, not an engineer. Convenient though it would be if it were true, Mozilla is not big because it's full of useless crap. Mozilla is big because your needs are big. Your needs are big because the Internet is big. There are lots of small, lean web browsers out there that, incidentally, do almost nothing useful. If that's what you need, you've got options... Sure, Mozilla could be leaner, and still do all the things it does today; and that's a noble goal (and, need it even be said, one that you can finally help out with if that is your concern!) But being a shining jewel of perfection was not a goal when we wrote Mozilla. It was not interesting to spent years designing and a decade implementing. The goal was to ship useful software, and to ship it quickly. Along the way we happened to come up with what is probably the most portable piece of software of its size that has ever existed, and what is reportedly also the second most widely used piece of software in the world (after Windows itself.) I think that's not too shabby an accomplishment, and if part of the price was a bit of bloat, oh well.
