    "originBody": "Draggable objects from Red Blob Games Home Blog Links Twitter About 4 Jan 2023 Many of my interactive pages have a draggable object. I want the reader to move the object around, and I want the diagram to respond in some way. Here I’ll document the code I use to make this work with both mouse and touch input, using browser features that are widely supported since 2020. Here’s a common case I want to support: Drag me Drag the circle with mouse or touch This is the simple model in my head: However it’s not so simple! Mouses have multiple buttons. Touch events can include multiple fingers. Events can go to multiple destinations. Right click can trigger the context menu. I ended up with this basic recipe: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } Text inside draggable Multiple fingers on same draggable Nested draggable elements Table of Contents 1. 🖱 Mouse events only 2. 👆 Touch events 3. 🖱👆 Pointer events 4. 🖱 Variant: draggable text/images 5. More cases 6. Vue component Like other recipes, it’s something that works for many cases, but is meant to be modified. On the rest of the page I’ll show how I got here and then variants of this recipe, including how to handle text selection. I also use this same recipe to handle situations where I’m not dragging an object around, like dragging this number left/right: , or painting on a canvas. I’ve tested this code on Gecko/Firefox (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android), Blink/Chrome (Mac, Windows, Linux, Android), and WebKit/Safari (Mac, iPhone, iPad). I have not tested on hoverable stylus, hybrid touch+mouse devices, or voice input. Also see my other pages: List of edge cases and list of dragging tests Test page to log the events, and unorganized notes How I handled dragging events 2015–2018 Note that this is not the HTML Drag and Drop API, which involves dragging an element onto another element. For my diagrams, I’m dragging but not dropping, and the scrubbable number example shows how I’m not necessarily even moving something around. So I need to read the mouse/touch events directly. 1 🖱 Mouse events only # When I first started implementing interactive diagrams ~20 years ago, touch devices weren’t common. I used mousedown, mouseup, and mousemove event handlers on the draggable element. If the move occurs while dragging, move the circle to the mouse position. function makeDraggableMouseLocal(state, el) { function mousedown(_event) { state.dragging = true; } function mouseup(_event) { state.dragging = null; } function mousemove(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; state.pos = state.eventToCoordinates(event); } el.addEventListener('mousedown', mousedown); el.addEventListener('mouseup', mouseup); el.addEventListener('mousemove', mousemove); } Try the demo with a mouse: Drag me Drag using mouse events on circle This might seem like it works but it works poorly. If you move the pointer quickly it is no longer over the circle, it stops receiving events. If you release the button while not on the circle, it will get stuck in the “dragging” state. To fix these problems use mousedown on the circle to add mousemove and mouseup on the document. Then on mouseup remove the mousemove and mouseup from the document. function makeDraggableMouseGlobal(state, el) { function globalMousemove(event) { state.pos = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = true; } function globalMouseup(_event) { document.removeEventListener('mousemove', globalMousemove); document.removeEventListener('mouseup', globalMouseup); state.dragging = null; } function mousedown(event) { document.addEventListener('mousemove', globalMousemove); document.addEventListener('mouseup', globalMouseup); } el.addEventListener('mousedown', mousedown); } Try it out. It works better. Drag me Drag using mouse events on document This code doesn’t handle touch events. 2 👆 Touch events # Mouse events use mousedown, mouseup, mousemove. Touch events instead use touchstart, touchend, touchmove. They behave a little differently. Touch events automatically capture on touchstart and direct all touchmove events to the original element. This means we don’t have to temporarily put an event handler on document. We can go back to the simpler logic in the first mouse example. If for any reason the browser needs to cancel the touch sequence, it sends touchcancel. function makeDraggableTouch(state, el) { function start(event) { event.preventDefault(); // prevent scrolling state.dragging = true; } function end(_event) { state.dragging = false; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; state.pos = state.eventToCoordinates(event.changedTouches[0]); } el.addEventListener('touchstart', start); el.addEventListener('touchend', end); el.addEventListener('touchcancel', end); el.addEventListener('touchmove', move); } Try the demo with a touch device: Drag me Drag using touch events This code doesn’t handle mouse events. 3 🖱👆 Pointer events # Handling both mouse and touch events requires lots of event handlers, and that’s what I used before 2021. Details→ Pointer events attempt to unify mouse and touch events. The pointer capture feature lets us use the simpler logic that doesn’t require us to add/remove global event handlers to the document like we had to with mouse events. This recipe is the starting point: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = true; } function end(event) { state.dragging = false; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x, y}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) } Much simpler! However, I almost always want to handle some extras, so I start with this instead: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } Try the demo with either a mouse or touch device: Drag me Drag using pointer events Let’s look at each of the extras. 3.1. 🖱 Fix: capture the mouse # The pointer capture feature lets us track the pointer even when it’s not on the circle, the diagram, or even the browser window. With mouse events we had to put event handlers on document, but pointer capture is simpler. Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 drag quickly back and forth drag stops yes ⛌ no ✓ drag outside diagram, come back in drag stops yes ⛌ no ✓ drag outside diagram, let go drag stops no ⛌ yes ✓ drag outside diagram, let go, come back in drag stops no ⛌ yes ✓ drag, alt+tab to another window drag stops no ⛌ yes ✓ Drag 1 Drag 2 Dragging without and with pointer capture Try this demo with a mouse. Circle 1 doesn’t use pointer capture on mouse. Pointer capture is the default on touch devices. Circle 2 uses pointer capture on both mouse and touch devices. function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } 3.2. 👆 Fix: scrolling with touch # On touch devices, single-finger drag will scroll the page. But single-finger drag also drags the circle. By default, it will do both! The simplest fix is to add CSS touch-action: none on the diagram. But this prevents scrolling anywhere in the diagram: Drag 1 Stop touch from scrolling anywhere on the diagram Try dragging the circle on a touch device. It shouldn’t scroll. But then try scrolling by dragging the diagram. It doesn’t scroll either, but I want it to. I want to stop scrolling only if dragging the circle, not when dragging the diagram. Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 Circle 3 Circle 4 drag circle page scrolls no ✓ yes ⛌ yes ⛌ no ✓ drag diagram page scrolls no ⛌ yes ✓ yes ✓ yes ✓ Drag 2 Drag 3 Drag 4 Dragging affects scrolling Try these on a touch device. Circle 1 (touch-action: none on the diagram) stops scrolling on the circle and also on the diagram. Circle 2 (default) doesn’t stop scrolling on either. Circle 3 (touch-action: none on the circle only) behaves badly. It looks like the CSS has to be on the diagram to have an effect; applying it only to the circle is not enough. Circle 4 (.preventDefault() on touchstart) behaves the way I want, and this is the code for it: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } I use the .preventDefault() solution. Note that it needs to be on touchstart, not on pointerstart. It works in most situations but I’ve run into situations where it did not stop scrolling on certain systems. 3.3. 🖱 Feature: handle drag offset # This isn’t necessary but it makes dragging feel nicer. If you pick up the edge of an object then you want to keep holding it at that point, not from the center of the object. The solution is to remember where the center is relative to where the drag started. Then when moving the object, add that offset back in. Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 drag from edge of circle circle jumps yes ⛌ no ✓ Drag 1 Drag 2 Dragging feels better if relative to the initial pickup point Try with the mouse: drag the circle from the edge. Watch Circle 1 jump whereas Circle 2 does not. The same effect happens on touch devices but your finger might hide the jump. The fix is to change the dragging state from true / false to the relative position where the object was picked up, and then use that offset when later setting the position: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } Tracking the offset makes dragging feel better. I’ve also written about this on my page about little details. 3.4. 🖱 Fix: context menu # Context menus are different across platforms, and that makes handling it tricky. I want to allow context menus without them interfering with dragging the circle. System Activation Windows right click (down+up), Shift + F10 key Linux right button down, Shift + F10 key Mac right button down, Ctrl + left click iOS long press on text only Android long press on anything One problem is that I will see a pointerdown event and only sometimes a pointerup event. That means I might think the button is still down when it’s not. It’s frustrating! I realized that I should only set the dragging state on left mouse button, and ignore the right mouse button. Then I don’t have to worry about most of the differences. I made some notes during testing, but most of them don’t matter for my use case. Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 Circle 3 Circle 4 right click circle turns blue yes ⛌ yes no ✓ no ✓ right click context menu yes ⛌ no no ✓ no ✓ middle click circle turns blue yes ⛌ yes ⛌ no ✓ no ✓ right drag circle is blue yes ⛌ yes no ✓ no ✓ middle drag circle is blue yes ⛌ yes no ✓ no ✓ ctrl+click (mac) circle turns blue¹ yes ⛌ no ✓ yes ⛌ no ✓ ctrl+click (mac) context menu yes ⛌ no ✓ yes ⛌ no ✓ ¹ it will turn blue in Chrome and Safari but not in Firefox, which treats Ctrl + click differently Drag 1 Drag 2 Drag 3 (Mac) Drag 4 Right mouse button down interferes with drag Try with the mouse: right click or drag on the circles. Try dismissing the menu with a click elsewhere, or by pressing Esc. Behavior varies across browsers and operating systems. Circle 1 sometimes get stuck in a dragging state. Circle 2 uses .preventDefault() on contextmenu. This allows the right button to be used for dragging. However, it interferes with the default operation of middle click or drag, which is used for scrolling on some systems. Circle 3 drags only with the left button, but on Mac Ctrl + click on Chrome/Safari will trigger drag. Circle 4 drags only with the left button, if Ctrl isn’t pressed. function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only if (event.ctrlKey) return; // ignore ctrl+click let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = true; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = false; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x, y}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } 4 🖱 Variant: draggable text/images # These changes are needed if you have text or images inside your draggable element: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); el.style.userSelect = 'none'; // if there's text el.style.webkitUserSelect = 'none'; // safari } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; el.style.userSelect = ''; // if there's text el.style.webkitUserSelect = ''; // safari } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); el.addEventListener('dragstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } 4.1. 🖱 Fix: text selection # When dragging the circle, the text inside gets selected sometimes. To fix this, use CSS user-select: none on the circle. There are two choices: either we can apply it all the time, or apply it only while dragging. If I apply it all the time, then the text won’t ever be selectable. Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 Circle 3 drag circle text is selected yes ⛌ no ✓ no ✓ select all text text is selected yes no yes Drag text 1 Drag text 2 Drag text 3 Dragging affects text selection Try dragging quickly with the mouse. Try selecting all text on the page to see whether the text inside the circle is selectable when not dragging. Circle 1 never uses user-select: none Circle 2 always uses user-select: none Circle 3 uses user-select: none only when dragging I think either Circle 2 or Circle 3’s behavior is a reasonable choice. Note that as of early 2023, Safari still doesn’t support the unprefixed version (tracking bug), so we have to also set the prefixed version. 4.2. 🖱 Fix: text and image drag # Windows, Linux, and Mac support inter-application drag and drop of text and images, and an alternative to copy/paste. This interferes with the object dragging on my pages. The fix is to preventDefault() on dragstart. Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 select text, drag circle page text drags yes ⛌ no ✓ Select text → [from here 1 2 to here] ← Selected text interferes with dragging Try this demo with a mouse. Select the text around the diagram, then drag Circle 1. On most desktop systems I’ve tested, text or image dragging takes priority over the circle dragging by default. Circle 2 prioritizes the circle dragging. Behavior varies a little bit across browsers and operating systems. The fix is one extra line: 5 More cases # 5.1. 👆 Feature: simultaneous dragging # I think this is an edge case, but I was curious what it would take to support. Can we drag multiple objects at once, using different fingers or different mice? For touch, the code I presented should already work! Go back to one of the previous demos and try it. However the code doesn’t handle using two fingers to drag the same object. The fix is when handling pointerdown, save event.pointerId to state.dragging. Then when handling pointermove, ignore the even if it’s not the same pointerId. I don’t have that implemented here, but try it out on my canvas dragging test. function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; state.pointerId = event.pointerId; // keep track of finger el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; if (state.pointerId !== event.pointerId) return; // check finger id let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } What about mice? The Pointer Events spec says Current operating systems and user agents don’t usually have a concept of multiple mouse inputs. When more than one mouse device is present (for instance, on a laptop with both a trackpad and an external mouse), all mouse devices are generally treated as a single device - movements on any of the devices are translated to movement of a single mouse pointer, and there is no distinction between button presses on different mouse devices. For this reason, there will usually only be a single mouse pointer, and that pointer will be primary. I think there isn’t any way to drag different objects with different mice. 5.2. 🖱 Edge case: chorded button presses # So here’s a tricky one. If you are using multiple buttons at the same time, what happens? Mouse Events send mousedown for each button press and mouseup for each button release. But Pointer Events work differently. The Pointer Events spec says that the first button that was pressed leads to a pointerdown event, and the last one that was released leads to a pointerup event. But that means we might get a up event on a different button than the down event! Try this Watch for Circle 1 Circle 2 left down, right down, left up dragging yes ⛌ no ✓ Drag 1 Drag 2 Multiple button presses is tricky Try with the mouse: press the left button, press the right button (this may bring up a context menu but ignore it), then release the left button. Is the circle still dragging? The fix is to check the button state in pointermove: function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; if (!(event.buttons & 1)) return end(event); // edge case: chords let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } Separately, the pointer capture continues until you release all the buttons, unless you explicitly release capture. I’m not handling this or many other edge cases. 5.3. 🖱👆 Variant: nested dragging # If the draggable element contains another draggable element inside of it, both elements will handle the dragging. The fix is to add .stopPropagation() to prevent the inner draggable from passing events up to outer draggable. I don’t have a demo here, but I made one elsewhere, where the red draggable is a child of the yellow draggable. function makeDraggable(state, el, options) { function start(event) { if (event.button !== 0) return; // left button only event.stopPropagation(); // for nested draggables let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.dragging = {dx: state.pos.x - x, dy: state.pos.y - y}; el.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { state.dragging = null; } function move(event) { if (!state.dragging) return; event.stopPropagation(); // for nested draggables let {x, y} = state.eventToCoordinates(event); state.pos = {x: x + state.dragging.dx, y: y + state.dragging.dy}; } el.addEventListener('pointerdown', start); el.addEventListener('pointerup', end); el.addEventListener('pointercancel', end); el.addEventListener('pointermove', move) el.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => e.preventDefault()); } 5.4. 🖱👆 Variant: dragging on canvas # I normally work with SVG, but if working with a(either 2D Canvas or WebGL), I can’t set the event handlers or mouse pointer shape on the draggable element only. So I set the event handler on theand then: pointerdown, touchstart, dragstart: early return if not over a draggable object pointermove: set the cursor based on whether it’s over a draggable object 5.5. Variant: hover with mouse # Sometimes I want to act on hover with the mouse (no buttons pressed) but that doesn’t work with touch devices, so I use drag with touch. I modify the recipe by removing the if (!state.dragging) line from pointermove. { DEMO? } Do I need to release the capture? Yes releasing capture turns out to be important on many of my pages, like responsive-design 5.6. Variant: toggle paint { idea is that in addition to dragging I also want to capture the state of the first grid space I’m on, and then use that for all the move events; maybe this should go on a different page } 5.7. TODO: lostpointercapture I know that lostpointercapture can be used to detect that we lost pointer capture, but I haven’t yet figured out all the situations in which it fires, and what I should do about them. 6 Vue component # Here’s an attempt at acomponent in Vue v3, Options API:import {convertPixelToSvgCoord} from './svgcoords.js'; export default { props: {modelValue: Object}, // should be {x, y} data() { return { dragging: false }; }, methods: { start(event) { if (event.ctrlKey) return; let {x, y} = convertPixelToSvgCoord(event); this.dragging = {dx: this.modelValue.x - x, dy: this.modelValue.y - y}; event.currentTarget.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); }, end(_event) { this.dragging = null; }, move(event) { let {x, y} = convertPixelToSvgCoord(event); this.$emit('update:modelValue', { x: x + this.dragging.dx, y: y + this.dragging.dy, }); }, } }g { cursor: grab; } g.dragging { user-select: none; cursor: grabbing; }and here’s the same thing in the Composition API: import {ref} from 'vue'; import {convertPixelToSvgCoord} from './svgcoords.js'; const props = defineProps({ modelValue: Object // should be {x, y} }); const emit = defineEmits(['update:modelValue']) const dragging = ref(false); function start(event) { if (event.ctrlKey) return; let {x, y} = convertPixelToSvgCoord(event); dragging.value = {dx: props.modelValue.x - x, dy: props.modelValue.y - y}; event.currentTarget.setPointerCapture(event.pointerId); } function end(event) { dragging.value = null; } function move(event) { let {x, y} = convertPixelToSvgCoord(event); emit('update:modelValue', { x: x + dragging.value.dx, y: y + dragging.value.dy, }); }g { cursor: grab; } g.dragging { user-select: none; cursor: grabbing; }This component only handles SVG elements, as that’s my primary need. You’ll have to modify it if you’re dragging HTML elements. You can use computed setters on the model value if you want to apply constraints like bounds checking or grid snapping. If you’re using Vue v2 (whether Options API or Composition API), you’ll need to change the v-model prop from modelValue to value and the event from update:modelValue to input. To use this component, create position variables (data in Options API or ref in Composition API) of type {x, y}, and then draw the desired shape as the child slot of the draggable component. In this example, I have redCircle and blueSquare positions: I put a full example of this on the Vue Playground, with both Options API and Composition API components.

Excellent article!One of the hardest things I have needed to code from scratch is drag-to-reorder.

When a user begins dragging, calculate the layouts for all possible drop targets (or perhaps just those that are currently visible). 2. For each of those layouts record the position the dragged objects ends up in. 3. On each mouse movement, select from those positions the one that&#x27;s closest to the dragged object&#x27;s current position 4.

[1] It was definitely a fun challenge and I still found a better way to do it later.What I ended up doing is when you pick up a card, I compute the layout as if the card was deleted from the board, and then it becomes easy. Wherever you hover the mouse, I just displace whatever is there.There were still tons of edge cases I had to work out, though, especially when you start editing a new card that hasn’t been “committed” to the data model yet. I had to add the option to shift existing cards out of the way to make room for a phantom card.It helps to recognize that there are just lots of edge cases you have to manually handle. If you try to tackle it as though there’s a more generic&#x2F;homogeneous solution, you end up going around in circles a bit with the design. I should probably create a blog post on all the different edge cases.As I said, though, I found an even better way to do my layout, which saves on unnecessary computations and makes the layout engine more flexible and user-friendly. (It’s amazing what a difference your choice of data model representation makes on your solution.)

I think I dropped the phone support in the end though due to the fact that dragging and dropping just didn&#x27;t feel right on the phone, tapping felt more natural. reply PaulDavisThe1st 11 hours agoprevOne extra detail, something I&#x27;ve learned from 20 years of working on dragging all kinds of objects around the GUI of Ardour [0]: handle ALL button press and release events as drag events where there is no movement. That is: press ALWAYS starts a drag that is finished by the release, and the code that handles release \"special cases\" the no-movement condition.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ardour.org&#x2F; reply hutzlibu 1 hour agoparentThat should also work, but I did not do it this way and had no problems after I got the basics right. I have general mousedown and mouseup handlers and use a timeout(~150 ms, but configurable), to determine if we deal with a click, or start dragging (or other things). And on mouseup (or if the mouse leaves the screen) and there is dragging in progress -> stopdrag. So dragging for me ist just one of different special cases .. reply wruza 11 hours agoparentprevWhat’s the rationale here? reply PaulDavisThe1st 10 hours agorootparentHaving separate code paths for \"it&#x27;s a press\", \"it&#x27;s a release\", \"it&#x27;s a drag\" just turns into a nightmare when you actually use all 3 input events extensively. Remember that while the motion events of the drag might be the visually interesting part, for the most part the interesting stuff happens at the beginning and end of them - i.e. the press and release.It becomes massively simpler conceptually (and even in the code) to treat any button press as a potential drag, and a simple click becomes just a drag-with-no-movement. reply rgovostes 1 hour agoprevThe article implements relatively basic dragging (notwithstanding the several edge cases that arise with web browsers).

It&#x27;s like asking how does a keyboard user facilitate click-and-hold to pan the canvas in a drawing program? They don&#x27;t. Panning with the mouse (or dragging objects) is one interface. The task is panning the canvas, the means to achieve that are varied.In my example, the answer to the question about accessibility is to additionally provide keyboard controls to complete the task (preferably ones that don&#x27;t - or optionally don&#x27;t - require holding a key). For example perhaps a key shortcut to enter a pan mode, in which the arrow keys move the viewport around the canvas. Problem solved.As for draggable objects, the task is re-ordering. How do you make that accessible? Provide an alternative means to re-order objects, perhaps using TAB to cycle focus through the objects, then a key to select the focused one, and use the arrow keys to move the drag preview to the nearest valid position in that direction. reply bastawhiz 12 hours agoparentprevOverwhelmingly, the answer is \"you don&#x27;t.\" Your UI should provide alternatives to dragging that allow folks who can&#x27;t use a point&#x2F;touch devices to interact with your page. Which is to say, don&#x27;t shoehorn keyboard support into your drag implementation, add separate keyboard functionality that makes sense in addition to drag functionality. reply stronglikedan 13 hours agoparentprevThat would be a moveable object, and I reckon it would be easy to implement using this as a basis. reply Syzygies 9 hours agoprevIn the distant past, there was this NSF-funded geometry center in Minneapolis.

For my diagrams, I’m dragging but not dropping, and the scrubbable number example shows how I’m not necessarily even moving something around. So I need to read the mouse&#x2F;touch events directly.The drag and drop API is doing a different thing that isn&#x27;t always appropriate - you can get it to do roughly what this article is talking about by making the thing being dragged invisible just after the dragging starts, but it can shrink things and doesn&#x27;t let you edit them as DOM nodes after the dragging has started. It also lets you drag something out of the browser window and try to put it into a completely different window. reply ww520 13 hours agoparentprevThat is a fantastic discussion on dragging with Javascript.

The short answer is: no.The longer answer is: I&#x27;m not actually sure how to solve this problem. The second site, simblob.blogspot.com, is an actual blog. It&#x27;s time ordered. It has posts. But the main site, redblobgames.com, is structured as a \"living document\" site, not as a blog. Things are not posted in order.I could try an automated feed that looks for any changes on pages. But I make small changes all the time. For example on [1] I changed \"So far we’ve made step have the same\" to \"So far we’ve made steps have the same\". I&#x27;ve been fixing a lot of broken links and typos this week, so there are lots of pages that have changed, but not in meaningful ways. I don&#x27;t want those showing up on the RSS feed.The second problem with an automated feed is that I have pages that aren&#x27;t meant for publication. I collect notes for myself before I write an article, sometimes for years. For example [2] is something I may never get around to publishing. I don&#x27;t want new pages to show up on the RSS feed, because most of them aren&#x27;t ready yet, and some may never be.So an alternative is for me to manually add entries to an RSS feed when they&#x27;re \"meaningful\". I&#x27;m trying to do this by posting to the simblob.blogspot.com blog. An example is [3] where I describe the changes I&#x27;m making to the mapgen4 page. These wouldn&#x27;t have been picked up by an automated feed because the HTML didn&#x27;t change, but the interactive part did, so I wrote about it. Another example is [4] which is about changes to the hexagon page. I&#x27;ll also go into a lot more details about why I made those changes [5].But manually writing blog posts means there will be changes that won&#x27;t show up in the RSS.

I think what I would try is Breadth First Search with multiple start points to calculate various metrics for the map [2] and maybe All-Pairs if you need more [3]. For example, you might use Tarjan&#x27;s or All-Pairs to find the most commonly used corridors, and then use Breadth First Search from those \"central\" points to find the \"farthest from central corridor\" points.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;roguelikedev&#x2F;comments&#x2F;dc4orn&#x2F;identi...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redblobgames.com&#x2F;pathfinding&#x2F;distance-to-any&#x2F;[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redblobgames.com&#x2F;pathfinding&#x2F;all-pairs&#x2F; reply otikik 18 hours agoparentprevYou are not trying to find a \"path\" since you don&#x27;t have a starting point - you only have end points. Your enclaves are more defined by the shape of the walls (roughly x cells in radius) than with the fact that you reach them through chokepoints. After all, a chokepoint can be just a small door in an otherwise big corridor, separating two big areas. And by concentrating on chokepoints you will lose all the \"isolated islands\".You might be luckier treating this as a \"map treatment\" problem. An algorithm that does things to the whole map, and then reads the result.For example: 1. Start assigning a score of 0 to all map cells. 2. For every cell in the map, set to 1 if it&#x27;s in contact with any walls 3. Then add 1 to every cell of the map if it contacts a cell with a non-zero value 4. Repeat the above step n times, where n is the average \"radius\" of you enclave rooms. 5. Every cell with a score of n or higher is a \"candidate\". For every candidate: 5.a Check that none of the cells around have a bigger score. If so, move on to the next candidate 5.b Check that there&#x27;s no \"treasure\" around it in a circle of radius n 5.c You have found the center of an enclave. Mark it with \"treasure\" and move on to the next cell. reply gabereiser 18 hours agoparentprevFind starting point in dungeon. A* to every room. Rooms with a large distance (iter count) and with only one or two paths out (choke points, use graph to see edges) become potentials, every potential that is _far & narrow_ is flagged “enclave” with rewards increasing by distance to start.This is one way to approach the problem. The other way is to do prefab rooms and when generating your dungeons, randomly select one or two prefab enclave rooms to throw into the shuffle. Shuffle the rooms and spread them out then connect hallways and such. This is the approach that Enter the Gungeon took.Another approach is what @otikik describes. Tracing the walls buy assigning a value to the cells that can then be scored. Minesweeper style. reply stefan_ 19 hours agoparentprevLots of pathfinding solutions prefer to work with connected convex polygons (since inside the polygon, you can always go straight to every other point inside). You could merge your cells into these polygons and then filter for small ones by area, I guess. reply Marazan 18 hours agoparentprevBrute force and ignorance approach:Choose random starting point and compute distance to all other points on the map.

I use words for variable names instead of single letters like the textbooks do. I use \"priority\" instead of \"F\", \"cost_so_far\" instead of \"G\", \"heuristic\" instead of \"H\", \"cost\" instead of \"w\", \"frontier\" instead of \"OPEN\" or \"O\", \"visited\" instead of \"CLOSED\" or \"C\", \"current\" instead of \"u\", \"next\" or \"neighbor\" instead of \"v\".2. The textbooks use an \"open\" and \"closed\" set. But in code, these aren&#x27;t explicitly stored in set data structures. Instead, they&#x27;re implicit. The cost_so_far dict(map) contains as keys both the open and closed sets, and the frontier (priority queue) contains the open set. So in my explanation of A* I focus on these data structures (priority queue and dict) instead of the open&#x2F;closed sets. And when I do talk about the sets, I talk about the combined open and closed sets, calling it \"visited\" or \"reached\", because it&#x27;s the combined set that is actually in the data structures.3. The textbooks use a priority queue with reprioritization. When you visit a node that has a lower cost than the previously found cost, you go into the priority queue and adjust the cost. In my presentation I don&#x27;t use reprioritization. Instead, I insert another entry into the priority queue with the lower cost. This makes the priority queue simpler (reprioritization is complicated). And in practice, I think it&#x27;s faster too. reply tsumnia 14 hours agorootparentprevAmit describes the differences here [2], but briefly:- The Wiki pseduocode uses Set data structures for everything. While these are covered in classes, the up-tree concept isn&#x27;t as heavily described as other trees- Looking at it now, it looks like the pseudocode is a little more beginner friendly, but \"back in mah day\" it was not- Although, RedBlob&#x27;s pseudocode for obtaining neighboring nodes is clearer than \"for each neighbor of current\" (Wikipedia pseudocode)- RedBlob uses Priority Queues and Maps instead of Sets, which connect better to other AI searches &#x2F; recommendation algorithms. Higher &#x27;priority&#x27; recommendations move to root in PQs while nodes in Sets... don&#x27;t... they just sort of &#x27;exist&#x27;- The Maps make looking up node costs more intuitive than lists (aka \"current := the node in openSet having the lowest fScore[] value\")[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redblobgames.com&#x2F;pathfinding&#x2F;a-star&#x2F;implementati... reply phkahler 17 hours agoprevThe page reminded me of Ken Perlins&#x27; page:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cs.nyu.edu&#x2F;~perlin&#x2F;Yes, the Perlin noise guy among many other things. reply bmitc 12 hours agoparentI always wish there was more specification surrounding his Perlin noise algorithm he has on his website.

Comments like this are why I love this site. reply recursivecaveat 13 hours agoparentprevI would guess it&#x27;s probably not worth it because \"how much do cannons improve my overall position\" is a tricky question, and making a really intelligent and sophisticated answer is not really visibly distinct to players from a stupid heuristic like a sigmoid function of how many walls the player has built. It&#x27;s an amusing curiosity that you can build stupid walls and trick the AI into researching the tech, but it&#x27;s better to make those walls you&#x27;re paying for useful, so you can rely on that being generally true.I think a lot about some advice I heard from the creator of Brogue. Essentially players have a tough time figuring out how AIs make their decisions and often assign complex motives to them when they don&#x27;t exist. His example was he coded archers to try to maintain a position in some range band from the player as their primary motivation in a vacuum. The community would assign all sorts of supposed logic to archer behavior because in real-world environments with extra geometry or extra situational AI routines they couldn&#x27;t see behind the curtain. Additionally, that most game AI exists to create a fun experience for the player, we only make it try to play well in service of that goal. reply trees101 11 hours agorootparentI agree, it seems tricky to actually quantify.

B. @stphrolland@mathstodon.xyz @davidoclubb @publicvoit \"couldn't even get to a useable desktop environment\" . What ? I have installed NixOs many times since I slowly started looking at it in 2016 or 2017... And I have had many problems with corner-stone situations, some needed packages broken in the current branch, or learning the architecture of nix package expressions in nix language, or with other package-managers not interfering really well like python pip or conda or perl cpan... But I have NEVER had a problem of having a non-useable desktop environment. NEVER. Just to tell you, although it is only my personnal experience of NixOs. Have you checked the MD5sum of the installation ISO that you had downloaded? 0 19 Std. Alexander Sosedkin @monk@social.unboiled.info @publicvoit > For example, when GitHub would be out of business or the service is down for some other reason, NixOS would probably be dead. Its main repositories are on GitHub and there is no obvious fall-back concept to other repositories hosted on different services. This is just plain false. Flakes and channels can point anywhere; the only thing that'd need special care to move is the registry repo that points to all the other repos. 2 19 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @monk Yes. And at least in my case, they all point to GitHub. 1 19 Std. Alexander Sosedkin @monk@social.unboiled.info @publicvoit my point is, you can point them anywhere, just find a suitable hosting 1 19 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @monk And my point is: all defaults of the NixOS installer are pointing to a hacked platform where anything could be manipulated already. Copying a tainted dataset still results in a tainted dataset, independent of the trustworthiness of a different hoster. 1 18 Std. Alexander Sosedkin @monk@social.unboiled.info @publicvoit OK, so, take the last commit before the compromise, move it somewhere, replay history, update registry, update default registry URL, rebuild installation media.

IslandUsurper @IslandUsurper@fosstodon.org @monk @publicvoit I can understand why someone would say it, though. By default, the flakes registries and the previous channels both point to GitHub URLs. They don’t have to, but it’s not obvious that they could be different. Two big things I would worry about if GitHub became unusable for any reason: 1) nixpkgs is friggen’ huge, in terms of size and activity, so picking a forge successor must be done carefully. 2) issues and PRs are hard to migrate. 1 19 Std. IslandUsurper @IslandUsurper@fosstodon.org @monk @publicvoit none of these problems are actually specific to GitHub, I think. It’s just what Nix uses currently. Communicating the change when necessary takes the same amount of work regardless of the host. Maybe the issues/prs migration can be easier with better tooling elsewhere. A disaster plan sounds like a good idea. I hope someone has one, but I haven’t heard of it. 0 13 Std. Raito Bezarius @raito@nixos.paris @publicvoit While I agree with you, there are issues, I worry that your framing is flirting with baseless conspiracies as you seems to be ignoring that there are many safeguards in place to avoid letting GitHub corrupt the whole project. Even if we didn't use GitHub, you have to understand that NixOS / Nixpkgs cannot force anyone we are consuming packages of to migrate somewhere else. Either case, I think this is kinda FUD… 2 13 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @raito I can't follow your accusation. The facts show that Microsoft got compromised since at least 2021-04. There is no claim by MS I know of that GH is completely separated from MS infrastructure that got compromised. Current NixOS setups are pulling from GitHub which belongs to Microsoft. Yes, this can be changed but that's not the point here at all. As far as I know, you can't protect yourself from a bad actor that has more or less full access to the GH infrastructure and backends. 1/2 2 13 Std. Raito Bezarius @raito@nixos.paris @publicvoit You are jumping from MSFT got compromised at time T to MSFT is still compromised and all GH repos are compromised with full capabilities for attackers. This is one of my accusation. > As far as I know, you can't protect yourself from a bad actor that has more or less full access to the GH infrastructure and backends. Assuming this without proof is, to be honest, conspiracy. I don't like Microsoft neither, but this is ridiculous. 2 12 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @raito The bad actors had years of more or less full access to MS infrastructure. Actors that can pull off such an attack are perfectly well aware of what to do so that they keep access when the original attack vector is not available any more. This is standard procedure for each intrusion attack. Furthermore, in such a situation, the original bad actors can provide any sort of access to interested parties. Yes, it's hard to digest but that's absolutely standard IT sec reasoning. 0 12 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @raito Furthermore, it's not just me who tries to explain the implications. Please read other sources that quote various security experts and how they judge the impact of this incident. Assuming that nothing happened to GH is understandable from a project's point of view (effort! trust!) but nothing more than wishful thinking without any proof. In IT sec, you always(!) assume the worst case just because of that. You can never be sure otherwise. 0 5 Std. * LisPi @lispi314@mastodon.top @publicvoit @raito Does NixOS not independently sign its updates and use checksums of the aggregate repo contents (not trusting git's mostly sha1-only setup) like Guix? If it does those two things, there's very little a malicious host could do other than denial of service. If it doesn't then uh yeah, it's broken and really should fix that post haste. 0 13 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @raito 2/2 Yes, there is no proof or indication that anything happened to any GH repository yet. However, in IT security, you don't rely on lucky guess. A compromised network is still a compromised network and needs to be restarted from a clean status. It doesn't look like MS is going to setup major parts of their infrastructure to introduce trustworthy hosts again. So where's the FUD in terms of reasoning? 1 12 Std. Raito Bezarius @raito@nixos.paris @publicvoit > So where's the FUD in terms of reasoning? > It *doesn't look like* MS is going to setup major parts of their infrastructure to introduce trustworthy hosts again. I think you answered yourself very well. In IT security, lucky guess are not primitives to build threat models. Hypotheses, assumptions, economics, politics, technical measures and careful analyses are. What you are doing is just lucky guessing that MSFT didn't do any form of \"reasonable\" due diligence. 1 12 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @raito After years of having a (potential) state actor in the back-end of MS, I'd be very interested in your assumptions that they really did not perform lateral movements and expand to linked networks. No tech measures can mitigate or contain such an attack that lasted for so long in retrospect. From an politics/economic perspective, we agree. We see what the economic decisions were already. But that is strongly orthogonal to IT sec reasoning. Trade-offs won, as usual. But no proof. 1 12 Std. Raito Bezarius @raito@nixos.paris @publicvoit But then, assuming the level of catastrophe you are describing. What value is there in using a modern computer? NixOS/Nix is not the only thing affected. systemd is in GitHub, systemd developers are from Microsoft, etc, etc. What is the usable advice we can get out of your whistleblowing? 1 12 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @raito I'm not a whistleblower at all! I just quoted articles published by MS & independent sources. I never said that we should stop using NixOS, systemd, ... We just need to be aware that there is no such thing as a trustworthy cloud infrastructure most probably anywhere except you deal with it yourself to some degree. All projects that rely on a pot. compromised infrastructure need to invest in mitigation measurements against malicious infrastr. which wasn't discussed so far AFAIK. 2 12 Std. Raito Bezarius @raito@nixos.paris @publicvoit > All projects that rely on a pot. compromised infrastructure need to invest in mitigation measurements against malicious infrastr. which wasn't discussed so far AFAIK. We already touched base on some obvious mitigation measures we all enjoy thanks to the concept of Git repositories. We have many more because of how nixpkgs works, but I admit I am slightly annoyed because you seem to be ignoring them and you didn't contact any expert matter, I assume? 0 12 Std. Raito Bezarius @raito@nixos.paris @publicvoit > I never said that we should stop using NixOS, systemd, ... > We just need to be aware that there is no such thing as a trustworthy cloud infrastructure most probably anywhere except you deal with it yourself to some degree. Right, but what you are saying is that NixOS is particularly reliant on GitHub whereas *everyone* is reliant on GitHub so… 0 5 Std. LisPi @lispi314@mastodon.top @publicvoit It doesn't have anything like Guix's fallbacks to (among other things) the #SoftwareHeritage archive? That's all kinds of unfortunate. 0 19 Std. Roomey @roomey@mastodon.ie @publicvoit many years ago (the 90s) if you were online you assumed everything you said and did was getting scraped by the NSA/ Americans. I don't think much has changed. If you want to keep something private, try to keep it off the web. It is safe to assume (big) nation states have access to everything, or if not, hoover up everything they can and will have access soon enough. 1 19 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @roomey Well, I somewhat disagree here. If you assumed state actors, especially USA state actors you may be right. However, now it's some hacker group that can share their knowledge with anybody. So the potential group of attackers is now extended to basically anybody who somehow was able to get in touch with the hackers who hacked Microsoft. That's a totally different game now. Furthermore, it's not only privacy that's in danger here. It's the whole set of https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informat ion_security#Key_concepts en.wikipedia.org Information security - Wikipedia 1 18 Std. Roomey @roomey@mastodon.ie @publicvoit it was my understanding that this \"hacking group\" _was_ nation state. Either way, the rest of your comment here is correct in terms of what's at risk. Best to assume compromise at some level. 1 18 Std. Karl Voit @publicvoit @roomey Attribution is extremely difficult. Some say it's the Chinese. But at that level, any hacker group (state or non-state) is able to fake attribution hints of any sorts. So we basically have no clue who did that and furthermore, who was given access to the special backdoors after. 0 19 Std. * Christian Stankowic @stdevel@chaos.social @publicvoit We really need an user-friendly alternative to #GitHub.

    "commentBody": "Everything authenticated by Microsoft is taintedHacker NewspastloginEverything authenticated by Microsoft is tainted (graz.social) 736 points by ColinWright 22 hours ago| hidepastfavorite334 comments dimal 19 hours agoFrom Microsoft’s blog post on the incident (Mitigation and Hardening section):- On June 26, OWA stopped accepting tokens issued from GetAccessTokensForResource for renewal, which mitigated the token renewal being abused.- On June 27, Microsoft blocked the usage of tokens signed with the acquired MSA key in OWA preventing further threat actor enterprise mail activity.- On June 29, Microsoft completed replacement of the key to prevent the threat actor from using it to forge tokens. Microsoft revoked all MSA signing which were valid at the time of the incident, including the actor-acquired MSA key. The new MSA signing keys are issued in substantially updated systems which benefit from hardening not present at issuance of the actor-acquired MSA key: - Microsoft has increased the isolation of these systems from corporate environments, applications, and users.Microsoft has refined monitoring of all systems related to key activity, and increased automated alerting related to this monitoring. - Microsoft has moved the MSA signing keys to the key store used for our enterprise systems.- On July 3, Microsoft blocked usage of the key for all impacted consumer customers to prevent use of previously-issued tokens.I’m not a security expert. What are the holes in this strategy? reply eqvinox 16 hours agoparentThe problem is that you have no way to verify what may or may not have been done by malicious actors using compromised keys in the meantime.If you have immutable, permanent audit logs, you can go through all actions authenticated with something directly or indirectly signed by the leaked key. However, building such an audit log in a way that someone with maximum permissions still can&#x27;t tamper with it is not easy — and not cheap. (And, worst case, the audit log may not have the necessary detail; e.g. just listing an authenticated identity, but not the way authentication was established — thus not allowing easy identification of possibly compromised access.)As such, the hole in the strategy is that it doesn&#x27;t account for other persistent backdoors that may have been added while access using this leaked key was possible. It only prevents further exploitation of the issue.

Curious if others have different info. reply WorldMaker 14 hours agorootparentFrom open source documentation commits and feature lag (new features for DevOps are old GitHub features and even now include GitHub branding) I think it is impossible to avoid the impression that GitHub is active development and DevOps is legacy.The problem is that Microsoft still hasn&#x27;t said that officially and directly out loud despite the writing on the wall. They continue to sell DevOps to new teams and point to its \"active roadmap\" (despite it being mostly unambitious and increasingly \"copy X from GitHub\"). So a lot of companies still have just enough doubt in the message that DevOps is legacy&#x2F;dead that they keep inside it and don&#x27;t migrate to GitHub, because Microsoft keeps giving them that doubt. I&#x27;m not sure if it is superstition on Microsoft&#x27;s part to not kill DevOps (it is an ancient team with quite a legacy; it&#x27;s maybe Microsoft&#x27;s albatross), some sort of \"magic\" migration strategy they want to keep secret until complete, or just that Microsoft loves telling customers what they want to hear and enough companies want to hear \"DevOps is alive and in good health\" for a number of sunk cost or emotional support reasons. reply erksa 19 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I&#x27;ve heard from cloud consultants in Scandinavia (which is going through a huge move to the cloud as many places) the Microsoft Azure sales machine is on another level compared to competitors.Microsoft will show up with 10 sales engineer, while others might just be a contractor or a zoom call.They present themself as the authority for non-technical business and is winning a lot on that.They&#x27;re good at capturing market share, no doubt about it. reply evrimoztamur 21 hours agorootparentprevMy old boss directed us to Azure because one potential benefit was &#x27;getting all invoices from Microsoft.&#x27; It was a separate invoice and not with O365... reply mschuster91 21 hours agoparentprev> I can’t for the life of me figure out how executives at big Fortune 500 move their workloads to Azure.Almost every organisation already has a huge-ass contract with Microsoft for Windows, AD, Office, Teams, Exchange and whatnot, deeply integrated with their core IT.

We had to go through all logs to ascertain customer data was intact, and since leaking private keys did not leave a trace in the logs we then wiped clean all systems these keys secured.This was a massive undertaking to coordinate and minimize downtime for customers but it was deemed necessary to comply with security regulations.

A decade or so. I guarantee you the CIA has been learning this with all their leaks. The FBI learned this this after COINTELPRO.What is not written down can’t show up as a grainy photocopy in the New York Times, or a viral video from Wikileaks, or whatever.What you’re talking about is a hammer to use to punish someone after a leak.

Or tell anyone.If you do have to write it down (for practical reasons), it’s best to assume it will be leaked eventually and write it down with that in mind.Even better, is in your operational assumptions, assume it will then be leaked shortly afterwards and build in ways to work around that.So for instance - key material should have easy ways to be revoked, rotated, etc.Operational rules should be easy to update&#x2F;push new versions, etc.Authentication shouldn’t rely on parroting a well known value (SSN, a plaintext shared secret, a biometric, etc.), and should be easily changeable&#x2F;rotatable.Most of these we’ve been steadily baking into our day to day lives anyway.What you’re talking about is necessary, but insufficient for anyone who has a secret they actually need to keep. At least in the modern world. None of those penalties are ever likely to actually occur either, because no one wants to pay them. And they know they will end up paying them at some point, because anything else is just not how the world works.For classified top secret information all those rules apply in some form, yet we’ve had numerous high profile leaks of TS information for years. The intelligence apparatus has done everything they can to destroy said leakers, but with limited success - and those secrets are still out there.And that is without financial incentive!That’s all.

As ever, there are nuances; \"only a Sith speaks in absolutes\" and all that.#1. You have no privacy ONLINE. Providers have perverse incentives to sell you out down the river. Therefore, you DEFEND yourself by keeping a shallow online presence. If you are a casual user, you keep as little information online, specially in social media, as possible. If you need an online presence, you ASSESS the risks and pay time and money to MITIGATE those risks. If you don&#x27;t see a Return-Of-Investment on those mitigation efforts, chances are you have been CONNED into thinking you need an online presence, but you probably DONT.#2. There is no ABSOLUTE security. All possible defense measure CAN be circumvented, not not necessarily WILL be circumvented. You ASSESS as many risks as you can imagine, and MITIGATE only those where you expect a positive ROI. The ones you don&#x27;t mitigate, you ASSUME. The ones you cannot afford to assume, you DO NOT TAKE by refusing to use the system.#2.a Corollary to #2. If you take ZERO risk management, you still have a BASELINE level of security based on the risk-reward analysis by the criminogenic&#x2F;sociopath portion of the population; they will not attempt an invasion if they do not expect to get away with it, or to gain something out of it. The more cynical people in the know claim there&#x27;s no security, the more this baseline approaches zero and the more vulnerable the general population is.#2.b Even if you are not part of the general population, the lower the BASELINE, the more time and money you PERSONALLY have to invest in risk management to achieve a bearable level of safety. Cynicism is costing US time and money, pal; don&#x27;t pee&#x2F;shit on the village&#x27;s wheel just because it looks edgy!!!#3.

This scenario is for the folks who are calling \"hyperbole\" when the actor is clearly, potentially a nation-state. This scenario is based upon an event that actually occurred.1. You have a $200 million piece of defense-critical equipment. 2. You know that there was a 5-minute period where a potential member of a foreign intelligence service was alone and unattended in the same room as this piece of equipment.What do you do with the equipment? You can:a) Put the equipment into service b) Disassemble the equipment on both a hardware and software level and try to detect if anything was altered c) Destroy the equipmentIf you choose anything other than c) you have probably never been, nor should you ever be, in charge of securing critical assets that can be targeted by a nation-state.

There&#x27;s literally no evidence to support that analogy.

The real problem with the cloud is people who see things as binary statements: \"cloud is cheaper\", \"cloud is more expensive\", \"self hosting is easier\", \"cloud is easier\", \"cloud is more secure\", \"on-prem is more secure\", etc. All of those statements are true just as all of those statements are false. The reality is far more nuanced and it depends entirely on the constraints of your business at that point in time. Such as what engineers &#x2F; skill sets do you have on your team? Capital to buy hardware, your physical location, the product you&#x27;re trying to build... etc.But the problem with nuanced arguments is they&#x27;re subjective to the immediate problem you&#x27;re trying to solve.

That weak link exists regardless of whether those engineers deploy to a centralised place or on-prem.Is there an additional risk having something centralised? Sure. But in the vast majority of use cases, that risk is going to be marginal (and for those types of businesses where it is an unacceptable risk, they are largely not using public clouds for exactly this reason).And we are back to my point about these conversations being nuanced. A security team, if they do their job correctly, doesn&#x27;t just make blanket statements like \"centralised systems are insecure\" -- instead they identify the risks and develop an IT strategy based around which risks a business is willing to accept and which are not. reply imchillyb 16 hours agorootparentWell, the supposition GP made was that Security Experts AGREE ON ANYTHING.

One cant pretend that those vulnerabilities are \"safe\" due to only spooks knowing of them. If you can find them, so can others.

We didn&#x27;t own the service in question, and he told me that, since it wasn&#x27;t our service, I should just focus on continuing our work, and that it wasn&#x27;t our responsibility to raise the security concern.In the end, it turns out it was not accepting expired certs -- there was another auth method superseding the certs -- but the behaviour I saw in this case was not unusual to encounter.Microsoft has many excellent engineers, even in security. But decades of culture rot take longer than a few years to fix, and a lot of old-timer Microsofties have this \"not my problem\" viewpoint that can lead to major security risks.

You want to provide a means for your developers to be good citizens to get out in front of security vulnerabilities.Building an in house solution to do this is extremely costly in every way imaginable, from the extreme expertise needed, to the ability to do it at a very large scale.There are a number of vendors out there who provide great software to do things like scan source code, scan dependencies, or scan a live environment for vulnerabilities. The best of those vendors have cloud-only solutions.You&#x27;re stuck either accepting the risk that, at the very least, vulnerabilities about your software would be potentially exposed for the world to see, or installing an inferior product on-premise.

Chrome runs with the usual privilege separation in multiple processes each in it&#x27;s own tight sandbox. There is no way to autostart anything.Even in the nuclear case of a 0-day RCE + chained sandbox breakout + privilege escalation to root, the threat can not persist itself... you just reboot the device and are save again.And Google has lot&#x27;s of experience in security, they one of the few who build their own browser, the most hostile environment.

Jacobs1, Bharath Hariharan2, Yael Pritch1, Neal Wadhwa1, Kfir Aberman1, Michael Rubinstein1 1Google Research, 2Cornell University arXiv RealFill is able to complete the image with what should have been there. Abstract Recent advances in generative imagery have brought forth outpainting and inpainting models that can produce high-quality, plausible image content in unknown regions, but the content these models hallucinate is necessarily inauthentic, since the models lack sufficient context about the true scene. In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Method Authentic Image Completion: Given a few reference images (up to five) and one target image that captures roughly the same scene (but in a different arrangement or appearance), we aim to fill missing regions of the target image with high-quality image content that is faithful to the originally captured scene. Note that for the sake of practical benefit, we focus particularly on the more challenging, unconstrained setting in which the target and reference images may have very different viewpoints, environmental conditions, camera apertures, image styles, or even moving objects. RealFill: For a given scene, we first create a personalized generative model by fine-tuning a pre-trained inpainting diffusion model on the reference and target images. This fine-tuning process is designed such that the adapted model not only maintains a good image prior, but also learns the contents, lighting, and style of the scene in the input images. We then use this fine-tuned model to fill the missing regions in the target image through a standard diffusion sampling process. Results Given the reference images on the left, RealFill is able to either uncrop or inpaint the target image on the right, resulting in high-quality images that are both visually compelling and also faithful to the references, even when there are large differences between references and targets including viewpoint, aperture, lighting, image style, and object motion. Comparison with Baselines A comparison of RealFill and baseline methods. Transparent white masks are overlayed on the unaltered known regions of the target images. Paint-by-Example does not achieve high scene fidelity because it relies on CLIP embeddings, which only capture high-level semantic information. Stable Diffusion Inpainting produces plausible results, they are inconsistent with the reference images because prompts have limited expressiveness. In contrast, RealFill generates high-quality results that have high fidelity with respect to the reference images. Limitations RealFill needs to go through a gradient-based fine-tuning process on input images, rendering it relatively slow. When viewpoint change between reference and target images is very large, RealFill tends to fail at recovering the 3D scene, especially when there is only a single reference image. Because RealFill mainly relies on the image prior inherited from the base pre-trained model, it also fails to handle cases where that are challenging for the base model, such as text for Stable Diffusion.

There are quite a lot of them where I&#x27;ve taken multiple shots of the same scene in quick succession, and it would be fairly straightforward for Google to detect such groupings and apply the technique to produce synthesized pictures that are better than the originals.

Sometimes, they keep the original cropped one but cut off top&#x2F;bottom. Sometimes it&#x27;s a combination of the two. It all depends on what&#x27;s being framed -- two people in a car usually benefits from cropping (nobody needs the bottom third of the frame occupied by the car&#x27;s hood), while a close-up on someone&#x27;s face usually benefits from extending the sides (otherwise it&#x27;s an uncomfortable mega-close up that cuts off their mouth).But having the flexibility to extend horizontally gives you the artistic possibilities. reply miahwilde 10 hours agoparentprevwow x2.

I can calibrate away most lens aberrations with OpenCV, but some of the outliers have so much cropping that I am discarding 75% of my good pixels to get a coherent result. I was considering using NeRFs to reproject the ideal camera angles, but COLMAP is not very tolerant of brightness fluctuations and NeRF training is relatively slow (considering my goal is video). This would be a nice solution to my problem, because I have a comprehensive set of angles to pull context from. reply Jorge1o1 14 hours agoprevWow.

I personally don&#x27;t like how they portray the new image as being equivalent as if the lens framed it in the original picture. it&#x27;s not, as they show themselves in the later portion (near the end) with the text sign. seriously irresponsible framing (pun intended) to what&#x27;s otherwise very cool tech. reply richardw 14 hours agoparentNice idea.

May I be pessimistic?This and the new demos I saw from WhatsApp&#x27;s new demo around persona-based AI can really alter someone&#x27;s perception and memories. I don&#x27;t think we are considering how it can really impact our understanding of our feelings, perception, memories and mindfulness.If you take a picture of reality and alter it with Gen AI to do something else and change the moment, what is the new reality? After a while, we might question if it was real or not, and then that might just become the new reality.In my opinion, GenAI is truly transformational as well as scary, as it can alter our perception. I wonder if anyone else feels this way. reply theultdev 12 hours agoparentNobody shows their true reality in public pictures anyway, it&#x27;s all staged in some way.For private pictures, it didn&#x27;t change your reality, you can lie to yourself, but you&#x27;ve always been able to do that. reply debarshri 12 hours agorootparentbut when you take a picture that capture personal moment and some software without your consent alters it with some generative stuff, what would that lead to?I disagree with lying to yourself.

I get that it&#x27;s informed by real details from other photos, but that&#x27;s not what authentic means.If I buy an \"authentic Rolex\" and receive a Chinese Rolex clone that&#x27;s built similarly based on observations of a real Rolex, I&#x27;m going to feel scammed and very upset. And I&#x27;m much more protective of my memories than I would be of a watch. reply dang 13 hours agorootparentOk, we&#x27;ve taken authenticity out of the title above. reply 101008 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, I think the first example is bad. This shouldn&#x27;t be used for the photos you took. What&#x27;s the purpose of having a photo if it wasn&#x27;t the real moment you captured? I could understand the usage in marketing or event photographies, but for memories with your loved ones (as the first example tries to show it) it just doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.Two anecdotes:1. A friend of mine met his favourite author (traveled from one continent to another for a signing event). When he shaked hands with the author, a friend took a photo. A lady (still hated by us!) step in the middle, and blocked the photo. Maybe an IA or a talented person could remove her, use a footage photo of the author and rebuild the photo... but why? What&#x27;s the purpose of that?2. A few months ago during the pandemic I scanned all the printed pictures of my grand parents with my phone. Aftre scanning like 200s, I checked one and I zoomed in: the stupid app applied some IA to make it better and it just was worse. I don&#x27;t care if it looks better for the untrained eye: my grandparents didn&#x27;t look like that. I now have stupid horrible verson of the scanned photos, where my grand parents appear with smooth skin and weird eyes. reply IanCal 13 hours agorootparentI totally agree with 2. I&#x27;m less sure on 1. Imagine it&#x27;s perfect - it would be an accurate representation of what was really there. The real photo is a snapshot of a very specific time that doesn&#x27;t represent the broader context of what happened.A different angle, if a friend had painted the encounter instead, it wouldn&#x27;t be exact but it would be a snapshot of a memory.I&#x27;m not hugely arguing in favour of it but I think there&#x27;s different scales here, from cameras doing \"merge pictures half a second apart so people have their eyes open\" to \"totally change their face\". reply nuancebydefault 13 hours agorootparentprevIs IA French for AI? (Like UE and many other abbreviations)? I could look it up but might as well ask the question. reply smcnally 13 hours agorootparentIn Spanish, too — and other subject–object–verb languages reply nargek 13 hours agorootparentprevYes it is !IA -> Intelligence Artificielle reply cmdli 14 hours agorootparentprevI would argue that authentic is a relative term, and actually helped me understand the product more easily. IMO, it is “authentic” because, compared to other image fills, it tries to fill in the data using real data from other photos. reply endisneigh 14 hours agorootparentIDK, when I think authentic, I think \"genuine\", and no image generation is genuine by definition. this is not a bad thing necessarily, but it&#x27;s important to frame these things correctly.ultimately we oughta think about what we are referring to. if we are talking about a photograph taken by someone, the authenticity is ultimately coming from the combination of the photograph and camera used. so when you think of a genuine photo in this scenario you expect it to be fundamentally taken by the user by a particular camera to create a particular photograph. you can use devices to take a photo without pressing the button, such as a timer, but the photograph and camera are both fundamental to the authenticity of the image. if the camera is no longer entirely involved in the generation of the photograph I would say that it is no longer genuine.Reference driven as described in the article is more appropriate, but alas it is verbose. normally such pedantry bores me, but in this case it&#x27;s pretty tantamount to what it is being presented in this case. reply tremon 13 hours agorootparentI think \"composite\" would be more accurate to describe this process. As in, \"complete a picture using image composition\". reply marricks 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s \"authentic\" in the same way that when you see something labeled authentic it makes you more likely to question if it&#x27;s actually what it says it is because authentic thing don&#x27;t need such labels plastered on them.Regardless, I&#x27;m pretty sure \"reconstructed\" it the honest word to use. reply jameshart 13 hours agorootparentprevWe need a new word: authentish. reply smcnally 13 hours agorootparentLike “truthy.” reply tremon 13 hours agorootparentprevHow do they know the data from the other photos is real? reply HaZeust 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;d call that \"contextual\" rather than authentic. reply waynesonfire 13 hours agorootparentlet me give you an example. when i draw a mustache on a face in ms paint in brown, that&#x27;s contextual but not authentic. reply sdfghswe 13 hours agorootparentprevHN loves arguing about words. reply debugnik 13 hours agorootparentAnd recent HN posts love to twist them and reinterpret them just for promotion. reply neilv 13 hours agorootparentprevThey really need to not use the term \"authentic\" to name this.They also need to be very, very careful when introducing capability to falsify photographic images convincingly.Using the term \"authentic\" for this (and how do they even know what&#x27;s an authentic memory?) doesn&#x27;t sound like being very, very careful. It sounds like being gratuitously reckless. reply thomastjeffery 13 hours agorootparentprevThis literally goes against the meaning of the word authenticity.Call it \"realistic\". Words matter. reply Timon3 2 hours agorootparent\"Realistic\" is the wrong word, since that&#x27;s what infill models are already doing, and the word is already used for that. You&#x27;d have to find something that differentiates between plausibly realistic and contextual realistic infill. reply QuercusMax 13 hours agorootparentprevSeems like it&#x27;s only a matter of degree, given that modern cell phone cameras take image bursts and combine them into a single output image. Filling in details in a scene from other photos taken at the same time doesn&#x27;t really seem that different to me. And seeing that photography has never really been capturing real life exactly, is it really that big a deal? Look at Ansel Adams - he heavily edited his \"real-life\" photographs, and changed them over the years as he made subsequent prints.(Disclaimer: work for Google but have nothing to do with this project.) reply drewcoo 13 hours agorootparentprev> plastering \"authentic\" all over this kind of generated photography is really disingenuousNo more so than \"virtual,\" which used to mean \"true.\" Or \"literal\" which used to be the opposite of \"figurative.\" It&#x27;s just another word being used auto-autonymically.Definitio fugit. reply thomastjeffery 13 hours agorootparentVirtual never meant real.Literally is often used in a sarcastic context. That sarcasm depends on the word meaning what it means. reply aga98mtl 14 hours agoparentprevI do not agree with their usage of the word \"Authentic\". reply crazygringo 14 hours agorootparentThe point is that it&#x27;s not based on hallucination -- it&#x27;s generated out of the authentic details provided from other images.There&#x27;s definitely a middle ground here that we perhaps don&#x27;t have a good word for. E.g. what do we call a painting made by an artist who sat in front of the scene they depicted, vs. a painting made by an artist from their imagination? There&#x27;s certainly some sense in which the first one was an \"authentic\" scene. reply CobrastanJorji 14 hours agorootparentYeah, except it&#x27;s still absolutely vulnerable to hallucination. Look at the last set of images on \"Limitations\" page. The algorithm knows that there&#x27;s a sign with text there, and it uses the original image to get the right letters in there, but it randomly reorders the letters rather than using the source image. \"Real\" and \"authentic\" is extremely misleading here.That said, props to them for calling out the limitations so clearly. I really appreciate it when people are up front with the problems like that. reply thomastjeffery 13 hours agorootparentprevHere are some better words of the top of my head:IntentionalContextualEverything about this project goes against the meaning of authenticity. reply emodendroket 14 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps verisimilar then. reply syntaxing 13 hours agoprev [–] Something…seems fishy? Like the example with the guy next to the robot figure. Their model happened to predict exactly the same type of figure?! Diffusion models are not omnipotent… reply foota 13 hours agoparentThe model gets the reference images as \"context\", so it can just copy the robot from one of the other images. reply syntaxing 12 hours agorootparentAhh I see, this makes a lot more sense now! reply bjornlouser 13 hours agoparentprevI wonder if he is holding that umbrella to aid the model in recovering the 3d scene&#x2F;scale from the reference images. reply IshKebab 13 hours agoparentprev [–] That&#x27;s the entire point. It didn&#x27;t \"happen\" to predict exactly the same type of figure. It used the context photos to know what type of figure it should render.You might be getting a bit confused because here the training process has to happen every time you use it, whereas in most AI applications you only perform inference for actual use. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I don&#x27;t think Facebook thinks for a second about privacy related issues. reply freedomben 17 hours agorootparentI love the EFF, but let&#x27;s be honest: they&#x27;re not a threat to Facebook. It&#x27;s like the elephant thinking about the ant.I would be overjoyed if someday that changes, but that still wouldn&#x27;t be relevant to a flagging today. reply mandmandam 16 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s like the elephant thinking about the ant.Accidentally a perfect analogy, because elephants do think about ants, and take steps to avoid them. The only other small animal they avoid is bees (not mice).And just like ants, the EFF are one group that could have lots of tiny little warriors scaling up inside Facebook&#x27;s fleshy trunk. reply Terr_ 16 hours agorootparentSimilarly, I think there&#x27;s something poetic about how elephants aren&#x27;t blocked as much by fences--even if those look more significant to us humans--compared to trenches.With a fence, the mass of the elephant helps to knock it over. With a ditch or a hole, the elephant&#x27;s mass works against it. It risks getting stuck or breaking important bones that are already under a lot of stresses. reply birdman3131 16 hours agorootparentprevMythbusters showed them avoiding mice. Shocked the crew as like many people the really expected it to be an old wives tale reply mandmandam 15 hours agorootparentImo that segment used a flawed design.> The MythBusters hid a mouse under a ball of elephant dung, planning to flip the dung over and reveal the mouse when the elephants approach it. When they flipped the dung and revealed the mouse, the approaching elephant was startled and quickly moved away from the mouse. The MythBusters then flipped dung without the mouse under it, but the elephants did not react at all. They then repeated their first experiment to confirm their results, and the elephant noticed the mouse and actively avoided it. Even though the elephants did not panic at the sight of the mouse, their acting cautiously around them was enough to have the myth be considered plausible, as it was not known whether the reaction was due to fear of or empathy for the mouse.... Note how they were wild elephants, in an unnatural environment, facing weird dirt behavior.In any case, elephants still avoid ants. replybigstrat2003 16 hours agorootparentprevI disagree.

But I disagree, it would be a story if this was a regular occurrence for sure, but moderation is a hugely complex, distributed, and opaque process. If somebody found code like `post.censor() if post.mentions(\"EFF\")` then yes, it&#x27;s an outrage. But it&#x27;s not gonna be that simple. The real story is probably \"when using statistics to make decisions, sometimes things that shouldn&#x27;t get flagged get flagged, and vice versa\" reply tqi 16 hours agorootparentAlso important to note that it&#x27;s not as simple as having a whitelist of domains that are exempt, because at Facebook scale that immediately becomes an avenue for accusations of bias (see all of the noise around the twitter files). reply tshaddox 17 hours agorootparentprevIf it&#x27;s a malfunctioning spam detection algorithm, and the malfunction has nothing to do with Facebook&#x27;s actual policies about what constitutes spam, it&#x27;s really not a story in itself, or at least no more of a story than any other downtime. reply lawlessone 17 hours agorootparentprevYou can probably make it do this with any link if you post it enough multiple times in quick succession. reply gaius_baltar 17 hours agorootparentprev> Even if it&#x27;s automated, it&#x27;s still not great for Facebook that they are treating EFF as a spam link. That&#x27;s a story in itself.Exactly! This is also one of the most traditional domain names (Creation Date: 1990-10-10T04:00:00Z). I can assume FB has a lot of people working on spam prevention and they should have reviewed all old domains, relevant NGOs, political parties, country-level governments, etc. by now and chose to not whitelist EFF. If it was malice or incompetence it is a matter of (endless?) discussion, however. reply clnq 17 hours agoprevIt could just be me, but I feel the offence&#x2F;outrage culture is very tiring on social media. It seems like certain parts of the internet have become a sponge of human frustration, often misdirected, often unnecessary.

Which is why I only read HN briefly every day and avoid pretty much everything else including corporate news reply gershy 15 hours agoparentprevI would offer that there&#x27;s no use for social media!

But I think you&#x27;re labelling this as outrage because we&#x27;re so used to seeing outrage online.No, this is just an observation with no strong emotions or reactions attached - it&#x27;s tiring and it&#x27;s probably unhealthy. No one has wronged me or caused offence to me. If anything, it&#x27;s self-inflicted. We all ultimately decide what we consume.Anyways, your comment was interesting in the way you see this, and I think, illustrative of the point I was making. Outrage online has become so normal it is to be expected. reply colordrops 11 hours agorootparentI think you misunderstand me. If I understood your original comment, you are saying you are tired of the social media outrage culture, with the complaint about the EFF blockage being an example of said outrage.I was just saying that it&#x27;s ironic that the outrage is being directed towards Facebook, which is usually the generator of social media outrage, and out of all the outrage you complain about, it&#x27;s the one directed at the source. reply clnq 8 hours agorootparentAh, thanks for clarifying. Yes, I agree. I think that social media is responsible for a lot of this outrage culture, although the culture has spread outside it. People were much less adversarial and easily offended in the 90s and 00s. There was a lot more empathy and agreement, overall.It seems like there are many small but easy to understand factors in social media that led to the outrage culture. In one of Sam Harris&#x27; or Lex Fridman&#x27;s podcast episodes with Jack Dorsey, an idea was brought up that we might have less fracturing in our society if the social media didn&#x27;t have a \"like\" button, but instead a \"thanks\" button. People like a lot of tribality and toxic things, but few are grateful for them. I think that things like these show the negative impact social media had in this area of the social fabric.You can really see how people are much more likely to take sides and galvanize against each other in every day life, even if it&#x27;s against their interests. It&#x27;s certainly not limited to social media, even if it could have been the biggest driver for it. replyjrmg 17 hours agoprevIt’s not at all clear to me that the account in question isn’t just banned from posting links, and they happened to try to post this one.And without more evidence, that seems more plausible to me than Facebook banning links to the EFF. reply jqpabc123 18 hours agoprevThis is about as clear as it can possibly get --- if you value privacy, you shouldn&#x27;t value Facebook. reply clnq 8 hours agoparentCan&#x27;t one value both social media and privacy? I don&#x27;t think we need to be very one-dimensional about this - \"either privacy or Facebook\".You know, ultimately, you can choose to not share that much with Facebook. There are tools for privacy that don&#x27;t let Facebook get too much from you. The easiest one is clearing cookies automatically in a browser to disrupt long-term tracking. Beyond that, there are VPNs and burner phone numbers. I feel like people are not as powerless against Facebook as you might mean to say, and it&#x27;s not that hard to care about privacy and value Facebook. reply loteck 16 hours agoparentprevWhat if I highly value privacy but also need to function in a world that often doesn&#x27;t prioritize my values? reply efdee 16 hours agorootparentIt might be hard to imagine now, but it was only 15 years ago that we were able to function in a world without Facebook. reply wizzwizz4 16 hours agorootparentprevBe strategically annoying about your values, whenever it comes up (but almost never when it doesn&#x27;t: don&#x27;t be a vegan stereotype).

And in all likelihood their spam detector isn&#x27;t that good, and there are many, many more posts than that.Every now and then one of those false positives will be an interesting web site or one that feels really obviously wrong. But that&#x27;s just what statistics does. When you take enough samples from a distribution, even very low-probability events happen.Sometimes something will feel really out of the ordinary and wrong, but it happened entirely by chance.If there were evidence of systematic decisions like this, it would be more of a story.

There&#x27;s no meticulous strategy document mapping out the pros and cons before banning accounts that upset the company.Mistakes inevitably happen when relying on this combination of flawed automation and human reviewers who are stretched too thin.

    "originBody": "Open menu Proton news Privacy basics Privacy deep dives Privacy news Opinion For business Subscribe by RSS Search for blog posts PRIVACY DEEP DIVES Privacy washing: Google claims to support privacy while lobbying against it Ben Wolford Share this page Published on September 29, 2023 In the public eye, Google presents itself as a champion of privacy. “Privacy is at the heart of everything we do,” its CEO said (new window) . But behind closed doors, Google is telling a different story to policymakers and actively fighting against privacy laws that would protect you from online surveillance. We’ve identified numerous examples of Google’s multi-million-dollar lobbying efforts around the world to try to prevent elected officials from protecting your data. From the United States to Europe and beyond, lawmakers increasingly want to respond to public demands for regulations against rampant data exploitation by Big Tech. Google’s lobbyists are there, trying to stop them. Just as the world’s largest environmental polluters have resorted to “greenwashing” to portray themselves as eco-conscious, Google and other Big Tech companies have used “privacy washing” to avoid scrutiny of their business models. A simple review of Google’s lobbying efforts shows the hypocrisy behind its marketing. Here’s Google’s true position on privacy Google spends massive amounts of money to influence elected officials. Since 2019, Alphabet and its subsidiaries have spent more than $125 million on federal lobbying, campaign contributions, and trade associations, according to lobbying reports (new window) and other records. One of the issues it cares about is privacy — but not protecting it. Google’s view is that “requiring individuals to control every aspect of data processing can create a complex experience that diverts attention from the most important controls without corresponding benefits”, according to its policy statement (new window) . This is not privacy. If a company is using your data in ways that are too complicated for you to understand and consent to, then it should never have access to your data in the first place. Google wants regulators to let companies themselves decide what’s good for you and for society. “Organizations must … take responsibility for using data in a way that provides value to individuals and society and minimizes the risk of harm based on the use of personal information.” But Big Tech has had this responsibility for decades. The companies’ failures are the reason people are now calling on regulators to protect them from Big Tech. Pre-empting democracy in the United States In 2018, California passed the United States’ first online privacy law (new window) , giving residents the right to know what data big companies collect about them, to see how they use it, and to delete it upon request. The law took effect Jan. 1, 2020. It’s the most sweeping general privacy law in the US to date, and that made Google worried. Before the law kicked in, Google tried to push for last-minute changes that would have exempted its business model from certain requirements. The proposed amendment reportedly sought to allow Google and other companies “to continue collecting user data for targeted advertising, and in some cases, the right to do so even if users opt out”, Bloomberg reported (new window) at the time. Although that attempt failed (new window) , Google and other Big Tech companies appear to have learned not to wait for democracy to run its course. Instead, hundreds of lobbyists have blitzed other state capitals promoting their own watered-down privacy laws. Fifteen state laws (new window) have already been passed or are in the works. Big Tech is hoping to pre-empt stronger privacy rules and undercut the momentum for a federal regulation with teeth. “It’s been this coordinated national push to advance really weak privacy bills. We’ve definitely felt outnumbered,” an ACLU representative told The Markup (new window) . Overwhelming European lawmakers When it comes to privacy laws, the European Union is a pioneer. So it’s easy to see why Big Tech has spent so much money (about $30 million in 2021 (new window) ) lobbying European lawmakers to protect their most cherished surveillance practices. Google has been among the most aggressive. Since the GDPR (new window) took effect in 2018, the European Parliament has sought to expand consumer protections through additional regulations — in particular the Digital Markets Act (new window) , Digital Services Act (new window) , and ePrivacy Regulation (new window) . Google has worked to water down or slow each of these. Lobbying against the Digital Markets Act was so intense that an EU diplomat complained (new window) their Twitter feed had been overwhelmed with targeted advertising promoting Google’s talking points. And Google took credit (new window) for stalling the ePrivacy Regulation, which would crack down on tracking cookies. Google admits that its policy was to disrupt the #ePrivacy (new window) Regulation. That explains some things, including what was said by some Google reps on some closed-door meetings. “we have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been…” pic.twitter.com/u7H9gFCDQz (new window) — Lukasz Olejnik (@LukaszOlejnik@Mastodon.Social) (@lukOlejnik) October 22, 2021 (new window) Perhaps the company’s biggest win was in the Digital Services Act. Three years ago, a European Parliament committee recommended (new window) tough measures against targeted advertising, “including a phase-out leading to a prohibition”. Google and tech industry allies responded with a massive lobbying campaign (new window) to convince lawmakers banning targeted ads would hurt the global economy. The gambit worked, and the draft law no longer threatens Google’s advertising. The plan to become ungovernable The United States and Europe aren’t the only countries taking aim at the surveillance economy in defense of their citizens. Google and other Big Tech companies want to prevent any disruptions to their business model. And they’ve identified a clever way to throw sand in the gears of any future regulations. Big Tech companies, including Google and Apple, have sent trade advisers (i.e., lobbyists) to meet with diplomats negotiating the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, a trade agreement involving 14 countries along the Pacific Ocean, including the United States, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, and Australia. Their strategy is to add a clause to the treaty that would make it more difficult for member countries to pass laws limiting their market dominance and allowing new privacy-focused business models to compete for customers. We explained how they are trying to do this (new window) in a previous article. Taken together, Google’s lobbying activities reveal the company’s true intentions have nothing to do with protecting your privacy. Any claims otherwise are simply privacy washing. Google won’t protect your privacy, but you can Google will never offer true privacy. The reason the company is so successful is because its targeted advertising product is extremely effective. It is based on knowing you intimately and showing you personalized ads at the moment you’re most receptive to them. This business model earned Google nearly $60 billion in profit in 2022. As long as their profit margins depend on collecting your personal data, privacy will never be “at the heart of everything” Google does. But regulations aren’t the only way to force privacy onto the internet. We as internet users have power through our choices. The best way to take back control of your online data is to use services that make privacy the default. It’s easier to opt out of Google than most people think. The first step is to take back control of your email, which functions as your digital identity for account creation, purchase receipts, travel plans, and more. Gmail is at the heart of Google’s surveillance system because it links all your online activities back to you, especially if you’re logged into your Google Account while searching or browsing. Proton makes it easy to switch. And our business model is designed to incentivize us to give you more privacy, not less. Proton offers services for free, but you can upgrade for more storage and extra features. This lets you pay with money instead of with intimate details about your life. We believe the future of the internet is private. People must evaluate companies based on their actions, not just their marketing statements. Privacy washing is just one more obstacle to a better internet where privacy and freedom are the default.

Many of my friends have actually found Instagram ads interesting enough to talk about them at dinners. It&#x27;s better to have those ads rather than random banners for things that you don&#x27;t care about. Google would definitely also argue that ad targeting improves the worth of the Internet and allows more sites to offer their services for free because they can make more from AdSense.The following only makes sense if you buy this argument:The data for ad targeting has been abused so often that for many (most?) consumers, it&#x27;s not worth it.Google&#x27;s perspective is: \"we can be a responsible steward of this data for this new age of privacy-conscious ad targeting\". The Chrome topics API and mathematical&#x2F;statistical obfuscation are things that a blunt tool like the law may forbid. As far as arguments go, I think this is actually a plausible one. I do think Google has somewhat OK privacy controls compared to other large tech companies, and way better ones compared to bad acting small sites and ad companies&#x2F;data brokers.That being said, I don&#x27;t love the concentration of power (that&#x27;s why the DOJ is going after them) - I&#x27;d much rather there be some decentralized way to ensure privacy but still allow useful ads, but we get what we get. reply tristor 17 hours agoparent> If you don&#x27;t think that all ads are bad, then I think you may agree that sometimes, ad targeting produces more useful ads.I do. Ads are psychological manipulation at scale. This well predates the Internet, even. Advertisements and marketing are immoral. As long as we have them though, I will concede that better targeted ads are sometimes better than non-targeted ads. However, I believe targeting does not need to be personal to be effective, it can be based on the content the ad is placed next to, rather than the individual visiting and be equally as effective without necessitating spying.As it stands, at best ads are malware, at worst they are concentrated form of social evil. reply gambiting 17 hours agorootparent>>Advertisements and marketing are immoral.So if you are selling something it&#x27;s literally immoral to tell other people about it? How do you think people will ever find your store or product that you make? Just randomly stumble upon it? I&#x27;m genuinely curious. reply tristor 17 hours agorootparentIt is not immoral to tell someone the bare facts of your offer. It is immoral to construct an advertisement, that is a carefully crafted message intended to manipulate the recipient. If your idea of an advertisement is a written text box or a person reading in a monotone voice the \"speeds and feeds\" and the price, then by all means, go for it. But if you think it&#x27;s okay to imply without specifically saying it that your product has capabilities it does not, or to make the viewer experience emotional responses leading them to believe your product will make them feel better after you intentionally made them feel bad, then I would strongly argue that your advertisements are immoral. reply ketralnis 13 hours agorootparentFurther, almost all advertisement is party A selling party C&#x27;s eyeballs to party B, without involving party C at all. Some people buy Vogue magazine specifically for the ads and cool, but my start menu on my monitor attached to my computer all belong to me, not Microsoft to then auction off to somebody else. A deal that changed after I made the deal with Microsoft that didn&#x27;t include that. That&#x27;s clearly immoral. reply voxic11 10 hours agorootparentWhen did you make a deal with Microsoft not to modify your start menu and how can I get in on that? reply ndriscoll 16 hours agorootparentprevSomething like listing yourself in a business directory seems perfectly ethical. Something like yellow pages. Maybe where you are limited to a logo, 1-2 sentences, and a URL, with e.g. category or location metadata for the user to filter on. There could be a uniform nominal fee to pay for the service, or have it be a public service. Businesses could be presented in random order when browsing, or maybe in order of distance from a user-chosen location. Basically, a pull model for people to find businesses that provide products or services that they want. A similar model could be used for listing products, and then maybe the business directory could let you list retailers that carry a specific product or set of products.Anything much above that starts to veer into the territory of paying to distort people&#x27;s understanding of the market, or convince them they want things that they don&#x27;t, etc. reply bostik 16 hours agorootparentprevNot immoral. Just potentially counterproductive.I&#x27;ve taken a stance, DECADES ago, that all ads are telegraphing a very simple message: \"my offering is not good enough to be discovered on its own merits, therefore I have to spend money to drown out the more worthy options\". reply xyzelement 6 hours agorootparent&#x2F;&#x2F;my offering is not good enough to be discovered on its own meritsThat&#x27;s kinda like assuming that because you&#x27;re such a good guy, you never have to leave your basement and your future wife will find you.You could just as well interpret advertising as \"I am so convinced my offering is good, I am willing to spend money for you to become aware of it.\" reply gretch 14 hours agorootparentprev> Just potentially counterproductive.It is definitely not counterproductive. Mountains of evidence and real $ back the fact that advertising works.You have a quirky pocket theoryIf you want to conduct an experiment, try making a product or starting a business and don&#x27;t advertise it. reply bostik 3 hours agorootparentI wasn&#x27;t trying to claim it didn&#x27;t work. That&#x27;s the whole point of it: to drown out other options. Hence for me advertising is a major negative signal as far as quality or suitability for purpose is concerned.It&#x27;s like being in the countryside, where each inn and resting spot has a fire going on. You can spot them by their smoke trails. Then some entrepreneurial individual wants to grab market share from the punters and puts up a massive tire fire. A billowing column of black smoke will be seen from way further off, and as luck would have it, blocks visibility to anything behind it. It also makes the surrounding environment worse off for everyone.And anyone who is attracted by the big flames will soon find themselves inhaling toxins. reply yjftsjthsd-h 17 hours agorootparentprevIn theory it&#x27;s possible for it to be perfectly ethical. In practice this happens so rarely that it&#x27;s not worth discussing. reply rmbyrro 16 hours agorootparentIt looks like a worthwhile discussion about which you have not yet been able to prepare a reasonably well thought argument to present. reply yjftsjthsd-h 16 hours agorootparentBecause I&#x27;m not arguing in that discussion: I would support ads that inform without manipulating.

The money for advertising is not sustainable if it doesn&#x27;t result in some sort of purchase down the line. reply chromoblob 7 hours agorootparentA business can also subsidize adverts for \"bad\" products by profit from \"good\" products. reply xyzelement 6 hours agorootparentNobody would intentionally chose to do that... reply chromoblob 5 hours agorootparentWhy?

You ought to know what the social and psychological effects of what you&#x27;re defending. It isn&#x27;t just informing people that a business exists. It&#x27;s getting in the way of their normal routine to shove your capitalist crap in someone&#x27;s face to buy. You don&#x27;t stop random conversations to bring up products in normal conversation, so it has no place to interrupt conversation.Advertising is fucking everywhere. I don&#x27;t want to hear about new products and services because all of them literally just want your money. I&#x27;m not always shopping or looking for a product. I find navigating markets a massive ass pain.We need legislation that forces advertising to the margins of society, where it belongs. We aren&#x27;t just sacks of meat to be manipulated. There is nothing just about commercial communication having a louder voice than the people. reply xyzelement 6 hours agorootparent&#x2F;&#x2F;You don&#x27;t stop random conversations to bring up products in normal conversationSure you do. If people are talking about cars for their families, and I have a suggestion for them based on my prior research, I&#x27;ll share it. It&#x27;s been raining a lot in my area recently, so lots of folks talking about which basement waterproofer they had a good experience with.The reason these things don&#x27;t feel like ads is because they are \"super targeted\" - I am telling someone about a product&#x2F;service that I believe they would be interested in based on what I understand about them. Obviously I also don&#x27;t get paid for this messaging but that&#x27;s probably not the crux of the matter here. If advertising was \"so good\" that I would only see ads for products that are genuinely valuable and relevant to me at that time, that would be great. reply gambiting 11 hours agorootparentprev>>This is a bad faith argument. You ought to know what the social and psychological effects of what you&#x27;re defending.I don&#x27;t understand why or how you see my question as one made in bad faith. OP said all advertising is immoral - I want to explore if they really think all advertising is immoral, or just some subset of it. Like, if you own a butcher shop and have a sign up front that says \"fresh meat here!\", is that immoral? If yes, why? Again, I&#x27;m genuienly curious. reply pierat 17 hours agorootparentprevYou smell bad.You look terrible.Your teeth are yellow.Your hair is stringy.But you can fix everything with our Cure-All Elixir, and you will be made whole again... but you had better keep drinking every day, or.....----------Advertisements are no longer \"we make stuff. Come here to buy stuff\".It then progressed to \"people who buy our stuff feel good\". But that wasn&#x27;t all.Then it progressed to non-spoken feelings when in proximity of thing.And it turns out, that you can manufacture want of your good or service. And if you gatekeep the emotions of good, wholesome, fresh, clean, happy behind your product, you can tell people they&#x27;re horrible trolls unless you buy and consume.But even those tactics weren&#x27;t enough. Now, most sales are in tech related stuff. And instead of telling people over advertisement channels, now they get pushed to your devices.And the current stage, also known as enshittification, is also cloud-tying to guarantee captive consumers, so they can&#x27;t easily leave. Cloud is the ultimate hardware and data roach motel.So yeah, looking at the recent history of advertisements is just broken, unethical, shits on the environment, and assails human thoughts just to sell more garbage. reply chromoblob 7 hours agorootparentI misread \"data roach model\" and wondered for a second what \"data roaches\" are :) reply endisneigh 17 hours agorootparentprevYour entire diatribe is not really about advertising inherently. reply svachalek 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s about maximally effective advertising. Why would you choose anything less? reply pierat 17 hours agorootparentprevThose whom do not know their history are doomed to repeat it.I am an anticapitalist, and I am acutely aware of what I am against. Advertisements, and how they solidified in the 1800s to current is one such thing I&#x27;m directly against.I&#x27;ve also seen Rome Collesuem&#x27;s chiseled graffiti to what amounts to \"eat at restaurant\". Rudimentary, when compared to hiring psychologists to extract as much wealth by exploiting the human psyche, but they were adverts nonetheless. And even those shat upon infrastructure and the humans who were there.I do think there&#x27;s a gradient of unethicalness in advertising. If I&#x27;m looking for a thing, and shown lists of things that match what I&#x27;m looking for, it&#x27;s at least consensual behavior.But these days, advertisements are anything but. They&#x27;re invasive, insidious, and many a time try to fool the human that they&#x27;re legitimate (and not paid) content.But I&#x27;m guessing the emotional words you chose to use tells me you&#x27;re probably in adtech. reply Hermitian909 11 hours agorootparent> If I&#x27;m looking for a thing, and shown lists of things that match what I&#x27;m looking for, it&#x27;s at least consensual behavior.An argument I find compelling here is as follows: sometimes I will look for something, and the world will tell me what I want does not exist. I will either build it myself or do without. If the state of the world changes, and a solution emerges, I would like that fact pushed to me (concrete example: new, more efficient battery chemistries for hot climates).Waiting for everyone to pull slows down growth of whoever is innovating this new thing - which in turns hinders their innovation - which in turn slows down innovation in the economy.There&#x27;s a tradeoff here with all the bad things you lay out about advertising, but I&#x27;m not convinced I should prefer the more rapid rate of innovation. reply sekh60 16 hours agorootparentprevWell put comrade. replyendisneigh 17 hours agorootparentprevAds are no more psychological manipulation at scale than words in general.

Advertisements do.You are being disingenuous in your response to me and trying to set up a strawman.I realize a lot of highly paid tech workers on HN work in adtech or adtech-adjacent. It&#x27;s even helped to pay my salary at different points in my career. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact of the matter.

You claim that some journalism is not immoral which is true. It must follow for the same reason that some advertisements are not immoral either.Seems like you don&#x27;t have an actual argument - posting on a Y Combinator MARKETING page, no less. reply bostik 16 hours agorootparentprevBelieve me, if journalists could tap the same set of resources as advertising does, they would. A really good editor can turn a mediocre piece to a good one, but it takes time, and 3-4 rounds of back-and forth. The same editor, working with a prodigiously talented writer, can turn a rough diamond into something absolutely incredible.Disclosure: I&#x27;ve done about a decade of freelancing, and during that time was trained by old-school practitioners on how to structure my writing. reply zlg_codes 15 hours agorootparentprevDoes journalism motivate people to spend money on shit they don&#x27;t need?People are so used to being inundated with commercial attempts at manipulation that it&#x27;s just part of their day.Do you use an adblocker? reply scrps 17 hours agorootparentprevPeople having a visceral hate of advertising and a vast swath of the internet&#x27;s users block them in every permutation because advertising is good for ones mental health?Car ads selling sex appeal, power, status and freedom are provable features of the car? Same goes for influencers pushing products, submarine marketing, etc... It is all psychology and it is manipulation at scale.

Not because of this nebulous fear of manipulation. If ad blocking was made impossible tomorrow then I&#x27;d learn other ways to tune out advertisements.

Not because they&#x27;re manipulative. reply scrps 16 hours agorootparentI can only speak for myself but I block advertising because I find no utility in them in any form. I am curious what others reasons are? reply Given_47 15 hours agorootparentTin foil hat time: I&#x27;ve started writing down companies behind ads that happen to slip through my defenses that are obnoxious&#x2F;offensive&#x2F;etc. Because, as you mention, so much of advertising is psychological manipulation. It&#x27;ll be helpful to have a list of offenders to reference to before making a purchase for example.The idea occurred to me after someone here proclaimed that they&#x27;re simply unaffected by ads, reasoning they don&#x27;t make rash purchases. Someone naturally countered with the extreme subconscious effect of ads.This list thing is imperfect (I mean look how omnipresent car logos are for example) but it&#x27;s an improvement from thinking you&#x27;re immune to ads.

They know my posts, my photos, my follows, my comments, my faves. They can use all that data to deliver highly targeted ads directly to my timeline.What I don&#x27;t want is Meta knowing anything at all about my actions _outside_ of Instagram.

If you&#x27;re selling locally, you rent a billboard on some street crossing, or a banner at a mall, or you buy a sponsorship at a local event because you think your target demographic will be there. At a demographic level, not individuals.On the Internet, geography translates to maybe using zipcode from an IP address, and demographics translates to choosing which websites (\"publishers\") to put ads on.And that should be it, that&#x27;s fair and should get you enough bang for your buck.Putting cameras in people&#x27;s homes, listening to their conversations, following them around in their cars, stalking their relationships, tracking their voting records, etc should not be an acceptable way of increasing the efficiency of the targeting.Of course you would make more money with this kind of spying (as what happens today). But this kind of invasion has great societal costs to privacy, and subsequently to freedoms, and should never be justifiable. reply gretch 14 hours agorootparent> No. The most ad targeting that should ever exist is by geography, and that&#x27;s it.This is an arbitrary moral line, and if you that&#x27;s the one you want to draw for your own life, then fine.But it&#x27;s also really dumb.Why should men see ads for tampons?

It is the nature of law to take informal behaviors and codify them into \"legal\" and \"illegal.\" At that point, individual people&#x27;s beliefs on a topic no longer hold full authority over what they may choose freely to do; the law dictates what one must or must not do.(And that&#x27;s just the behavioral aspect. The literal, legal aspect is that laws define terminology. From a legal standpoint, personal definitions are irrelevant when the law recognizes a definition in plain-letter). reply JohnFen 13 hours agorootparentI think that what isn&#x27;t true is the notion that any law is permanent. Laws can and do get changed or even removed over time. reply shadowgovt 13 hours agorootparentThis is true. Laws are modified over time.... the law rarely completely leaves the field once it has entered into regulating something previously unregulated. To do so is, generally, seen as returning an issue that needed the heavy hand of force back to the \"chaos\" of personal choices. So once the law replaces the murky, per-person-and-entity definition of \"privacy\" with a legal definition, that definition will stick.I expect, for example, any law latching what data companies may and may not keep to be very, very sticky. The details may change, but I find it highly unlikely that the government, having crafted such a law, will return to the condition of \"On this, the law remains silent; it is up to the corporations what they collect and the people what they yield,\" which is (mostly, with some notable exceptions) the status quo.Can you think of examples where something was regulated and then the government retuned it to an unregulated state?

I&#x27;m not going to jostle you awake, but I am going to remind you that they&#x27;re no more transparent in their approach than Google. If anything, your original comment highlights just how effective the duopoly is; both of these adtech companies are being treated like Marvel vs DC instead of Moloch vs Satan.So... as far as privacywashing is concerned, I&#x27;d trust neither of them.

SIGN IN SUBSCRIBE ABOUT THANKS PODCAST MERCH NEWS I Tested an HDMI Adapter That Demands Your Location, Browsing Data, Photos, and Spams You with Ads JASON KOEBLER · SEP 29, 2023 AT 10:59 AM The cord is detected as a \"computer\" and tracks “favorite videos, videos watched, and bookmarks,” as well as “Location Data, Sensor Data, Tracking Cookies Data, and Installed Apps Data.” IMAGE: JASON KOEBLER Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content. This site is funded by subscribers and you will be directly powering our journalism. JOIN THE NEWSLETTER TO GET THE LATEST UPDATES. I recently got my hands on an ordinary-looking iPhone-to-HDMI adapter that mimics Apple’s branding and, when plugged in, runs a program that implores you to “Scan QR code for use.” That QR code takes you to an ad-riddled website that asks you to download an app that asks for your location data, access to your photos and videos, runs a bizarre web browser, installs tracking cookies, takes “sensor data,” and uses that data to target you with ads. The adapter’s app also kindly informed me that it’s sending all of my data to China. The cord was discovered by friend of 404 Media John Bumstead, an electronics refurbisher and artist who buys devices in bulk from electronics recyclers. Bumstead tweeted about the cord and was kind enough to send me one so I could try it myself. Joseph has written about malicious lightning cables and USB cables made by hackers that can be used for keystroke logging and spying. While those malicious lightning cables are products marketed for spying, the HDMI adapter Bumstead has been found in the wild and is just another crappy knockoff cable sold on Amazon’s increasingly difficult to navigate website. This HDMI adapter is designed to look exactly like Apple’s same adapter. Here they are side-by-side: APPLE GENUINE PRODUCT AT LEFT, THE QR-CODE LAUNCHING PRODUCT RIGHT TWO PHOTOS “I don't necessarily see evidence that this is a truly predatory device, but it demonstrates well enough how one like this COULD be, and I've read about others that definitely are, that have an embedded web server, WIFI, key logger, and basically a small computer right inside the cable,” Bumstead said. “The super scary thing about this concept is that the user is basically introducing a predatory element inside their security bubble, so the device could conceivably get full access to whatever it’s plugged into.” The pseudonymous researcher known as MG, who made the malicious Lightning cables that Joseph previously tried out, told 404 Media that he’d put this adapter in “with the risk of garbage apps as well. People will install so much sketchy stuff.” “My gut says it’s probably non-malicious… at least not any more so than a lot of Chinese-authored apps,” he added. “I suspect it is just another Chinese knockoff device. They probably don’t have things created the Apple way, so the app works around it. Tons of the Lightning accessories on Aliexpress have you use a Chinese app.” I decided to connect the cord using an old iPhone that I no longer use and that no longer has anything I care about on it. After I had powered on the adapter (it requires a separate lightning cable to power it) and connected it to my monitor, a screen with a QR code, a serial number, and the branding “LIVE TV” popped up. I scanned the cord and was taken to the website for EZ Cast, an adapter company that claims to have “more than 10M users around the world who use the complete EZ Cast solution for work and leisure applications.” Cybersecurity firm Check Point previously analyzed what it described as an “EZCast dongle.” The company found it was easy to brute force the device’s 8-digit numeric password. Check Point writes it contacted EZCast about its findings back in 2016, but did not receive a response. “The EZCast device was never designed with security in mind,” Check Point writes. The portal has a headline that says “We do not charge any fees on our website!” and displayed an ad for something called “FANJESTIC,” which is ostensibly a streaming service that the company is trying to get users to sign up for (and does indeed require a credit card, and costs $49.95 a month). The site MalwareTips.com has identified this as an autobilling site that is difficult to cancel. FANJESTIC is not the same as the EZ Cast app that the QR code ultimately got me to download in order to use it. The QR code page also has an infographic that implores me click “Trust this computer” when I plug my iPhone in (an ordinary HDMI cable should not be detected as a “computer,” for what it’s worth). Because I enjoy living dangerously, I did plug my phone in, unlocked it with my passcode, trusted the “computer” and let the website take me to the App Store, where I downloaded the EZ Cast App, which has a 2.1/5 rating and 878 reviews. Example reviews: “It’s not working.” “Useless and frustrating.” “Why go through all this trouble for a mirroring device?” “I don’t understand why I have to buy an app from a third party company to use what looks to be an apple product in appearance” “SCAM!” “Doesn’t work,” “Don’t fall for this app at a karaoke machine,” “Totally fake … It makes me suspicious of Spyware. This App and the cable = JUNK.” Some of the reviews said they bought the cable from Amazon, another mentions it came from Walmart, another mentions eBay. After opening the app, I was immediately prompted to give EZ Cast my location and to accept a Privacy Policy from a company called Actions Microelectronics Co., Ltd. that says EZ Cast would be collecting my email address, use tracking cookies, take my location, track my “favorite videos, videos watched, and bookmarks,” as well as “Location Data, Sensor Data, Tracking Cookies Data, Installed Apps Data,” and would be using that data to target ads to me. It also required access to my Local Network, asked for access to my photos, settings, Bluetooth, and camera. After doing all of this, I was able to mirror my screen from my iPhone to my monitor. It insisted it needed all of this data in order to mirror the screen from my phone to a monitor that I owned, via a cable that is physically connected between the two. It said it would share this data with advertisers, and that “If you are located outside China and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to China and process it there” (it should be noted that China-based companies are required by law to store customer data in China, so perhaps this specific provision isn’t that odd or surprising, but the the privacy policy about my data ending up in China was refreshingly blunt.) Almost anything I tried to do on the EZ Cast app required a permission of some sort, and ads for streaming services and other apps popped up almost anytime I clicked anything. The app also has its own specific embedded web browser, as well as a specific quasi streaming service called “EZChannel,” which is just an interface for playing YouTube videos, which also requires access to your location. The app also has a camera function that lets you doodle on images, for some reason. It also turned on four different analytics trackers, including something it calls “Google Analytics for dongles,” a term that, when Googled, returns nothing remotely useful. While I was interested in getting this cable because I’m generally obsessed with weird cables and crappy gadgets, the existence of this adapter is actually particularly relevant given the FTC’s lawsuit against Amazon, which blasts the company for making its site harder to navigate and for placing tons of spammy ads where relevant search results used to be. A quick search shows various Reddit users who are confused by the QR code, some of whom said they bought the cable on Amazon. Bumstead is almost positive that the cord itself came from Amazon leftovers or returns. Amazon does have an EZCast store, but it’s not currently selling this specific cord, from what I can tell. SOME OF THE CORDS JOHN BUMSTEAD GOT. IMAGE: JOHN BUMSTEAD “A lot of recyclers end up with Amazon returns boxes, you can buy them for a certain amount of money from Amazon or their partners. They tend to have a bunch of cables on the bottom since they fall below the big items. So I’ve had recyclers dump the ‘crumbs’ into a single box and sell them to me.” Bumstead told me, adding that he had between 20 and 30 of these cords. “It’s pretty wacky stuff and lots of fun, you get bizarre gizmos you’ve never heard of, ie little robots that walk around when you plug their cable into usb, cables that glow in patterns, etc.” “I should say I don’t know 100% it’s ALL originating from Amazon, but that’s what all the recyclers in question have told me and shown me when I was there,” he added. “Amazon does dump a lot of stuff that sellers have warehoused via FBA and choose not to have it sent back to them.” LATEST POSTS BEHIND THE BLOG: TIKTOK DOXING, THE ROMAN EMPIRE, AND ALIEN ‘ENCOUNTERS’ SEP 29, 2023 $260 MILLION AI COMPANY RELEASES UNDELETABLE CHATBOT THAT GIVES DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON MURDER, ETHNIC CLEANSING SEP 29, 2023 I TESTED AN HDMI ADAPTER THAT DEMANDS YOUR LOCATION, BROWSING DATA, PHOTOS, AND SPAMS YOU WITH ADS SEP 29, 2023 FOOD DELIVERY ROBOTS ARE FEEDING CAMERA FOOTAGE TO THE LAPD, INTERNAL EMAILS SHOW SEP 28, 2023 HOW THE “SURVEILLANCE AI PIPELINE” LITERALLY OBJECTIFIES HUMAN BEINGS SEP 28, 2023 PODCAST: TICKET SCALPERS, THE NEW FRONTIER OF AI CHAT BOTS, AND MASS DOXING ON TIKTOK SEP 27, 2023 LOBBYISTS PUSH SELF-DRIVING TRUCKS LAW THROUGH CALIFORNIA, NO SAFETY OPERATORS REQUIRED SEP 27, 2023 BIG TECH LOBBYIST ‘STUNNED’ PEOPLE THINK PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE ‘CONSPIRACY’ IS REAL SEP 27, 2023 Unparalleled access to hidden worlds both online and IRL. 404 Media is a new independent media company founded by technology journalists Jason Koebler, Emanuel Maiberg, Samantha Cole, and Joseph Cox.

You can make an app without camera permissions, send an intent that opens the built-in camera to take a picture and you are given access to only that picture.

I think it’s part of that same photo picker interface.But that’s not what I was imagining. I was thinking of something in the system that did the QR code scanning for you so that you could just point the camera and as soon as it recognized one the app would get the data. That way the user doesn’t have to frame it and take the picture and select that it’s OK to use in the app.That’s how adding HomeKit devices work. You hit the add device button in the Home app and a view of the camera comes up. The instant it sees one of the HomeKit QR codes it goes away and starts doing its thing. It’s a great user experience.But third parties can’t do that without requesting camera access first to get access to the live camera view. A system library could provide it. replyfolmar 11 hours agoparentprev [–] I don&#x27;t know for iOS but on Android they are not excused, just register intent for your url and let the system camera app&#x2F;qr code scanner pass it.Effectively you can expect it to work for Android 8+ as the previous versions don&#x27;t necessarily have a QR code scanner. replyApplications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Just ask the companies trying four-day schedules. At ThredUp, an Oakland, Calif.-based online clothing reseller, moving its nearly 300 salaried employees to a Monday-to-Thursday week meant culling meetings, focusing on the most important work and curtailing lengthy email exchanges. The shorter week can get hectic, and work sometimes spills into Fridays, but employees say having more time to recharge is worth it. “It’s not for everybody,” said ThredUp’s chief people officer, Natalie Breece, who helped lead the transition. “It requires a constant evaluation of your own behaviors and your organization’s behaviors to move faster.” Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Once a workers’ pipe dream, the four-day, 32-hour workweek is gaining ground as hundreds of employers try the schedules and businesses rethink the conventional ways of work. The United Auto Workers made the shorter week a demand in its contract talks with Detroit automakers. Lawmakers in California, Massachusetts and other states have introduced bills aimed at pushing more businesses to adopt a four-day schedule. Most proposals are long shots but signify the appeal in policy circles. Organizations that have dipped a toe into shortened workweeks say it has resulted in happier, healthier staff, less turnover and a wave of interest from job applicants—usually with little to no loss in productivity. Yet working smarter, not harder, isn’t as easy as it sounds. Managers at ThredUp in Oakland, Calif., cut back on meetings so staff could focus on work. PHOTO: RUSSELL ABRAHAM First, Kill the Meetings Meeting bloat was one of ThredUp’s biggest targets as it gave the four-day week a test run before making it official early last year. Department heads cut meetings by roughly 20% after reviewing which were really necessary and which served mostly as progress reports. Managers and workers were trained on running more efficient huddles and volleying fewer emails. (One tip: Pick up the phone after three rounds of replies without a resolution.) Tuesdays were deemed “maker days,” devoted mostly to uninterrupted focus work. Learning to say no was an adjustment, Breece said. Some employees fretted whether they could get ruthless with their time. But with the whole staff tasked to be more disciplined, “it gives everybody space to say, ‘I am not going to join that,’” she said. Or, they can ask to trade updates or ideas as they happen, via Slack, email or other tools. Anton Naumenko of ThredUp says he couldn’t imagine returning to a five-day workweek. PHOTO: NICK WADLER Not everyone at ThredUp gets a four-day workweek. The nearly 1,500 hourly wage workers in its distribution centers have the option to work flexible shifts across three to five days. Last year, the company laid off 15% of its corporate, salaried workforce to help rein in costs. Still, voluntary turnover among corporate employees fell to 4% last year, less than half of what it was in 2020. More than half of new hires who were surveyed said the shorter workweek tipped the scale in their decision to join. And over 90% of employees, who the company says are meeting the same goals as before, said the four-day workweek has boosted their productivity. After the trial run, “at least two engineers said to me, ‘I’ll take a pay reduction to keep Fridays off,’” said Anton Naumenko, senior director of software engineering. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Many four-day-week employers don’t appear to be operating more efficiently, though, according to data from ActivTrak, a maker of workforce analytics software. Gabriela Mauch, vice president of ActivTrak’s productivity lab, suspects that is because management hasn’t revamped the way teams work. Examining the activity of 158,000 employees at 1,900 companies, her team found those at companies with four-day schedules worked slightly fewer hours a day than those working five days. And the four-day workers spent less time on focus work or other productive activity. Scott Hendler tried a four-day workweek at his 16-person law firm in Austin, Texas, for a year and a half before returning to five days this year. Little changed about the way people worked, he said—the idea was simply to squeeze the five-day workload into four to have longer weekends. Courts were still open five days a week, and at least one or two people would be pulled in to work when something got scheduled on a Friday. Cramming a week’s work into four days was stressful for some staff. Hendler says he would like to make the schedule work. “I just don’t know how to put the theory into practice in a way that is productive,” he said. Productive or Procrastinating? Henry Ford cut the standard workweek to five days from six in the 1920s on the premise that a more compressed schedule, along with assembly-line innovations, would make work more efficient. Since then, predictions that technological and economic advances would result in our working less haven’t borne out. As far back as 1956, then-Vice President Richard Nixon declared a four-day workweek would be reality for most Americans in the “not-too-distant future.” “It requires a constant evaluation of your own behaviors and your organization’s behaviors to move faster.” — Natalie Breece, chief people officer, ThredUp One reason shorter weeks remain out of reach, skeptics say, is that it is tough for large companies with customers and staff across time zones and countries to find a shortened schedule that works for all. A handful of big brand names such as Unilever and Samsung have experimented with a shorter week on a limited basis, but most adoptees are much smaller firms. Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, says it is doubtful most businesses can shed a fifth of the workweek and maintain productivity. “Whenever I talk to managers, they find the topic pretty insulting—they argue it implies they are completely wasting a day a week,” he said. A more viable approach for giving people more leisure time, he says, is to offer the option of four-day schedules, at four days’ pay. Advertisement - Scroll to Continue “But that’s not a new idea,” he added. “It’s called part-time work.” A four-day week holds less potential for businesses that already run a tight ship, according to Steve Glaveski, chief executive of Collective Campus, a corporate innovation and startup accelerator in Australia. Collective Campus briefly tested a four-day week a couple of years ago, after another experiment with a six-hour workday. With shorter days, staff had gotten more efficient by setting priorities, automating or outsourcing basic tasks and reserving large chunks of time for focused work. Glaveski wanted to see what would happen if they dropped Fridays, too. In a survey, the team scored their emotional well-being slightly higher than before. But productivity, measured by revenue, marketing leads and other metrics, dropped 20%. Four-day weeks—especially when workers are logging 8-hour-plus days—aren’t optimal, he said, citing research suggesting four hours is the maximum most people can spend in a deep-work, flow state. Focus tapers off fast after that. “With four eight-hour days, you’re still going to be spending a lot of that time on shallow work,” said Glaveski, who has written a book on working more productively. Counterintuitive Approach Retta Kekic of Qwick, in Phoenix, says the company shifted to a four-day workweek to tackle employee burnout. PHOTO: JAMES LEE At first, condensing the workweek sounded illogical to some leaders at Qwick, an online staffing platform for the hospitality industry. It was late 2021 and the company—after laying off two-thirds of its employees in the initial Covid-19 lockdowns—was facing three times the business it normally had finding workers to staff now-bustling restaurants, stadiums and event spaces. Qwick’s staff was already overwhelmed working a five-day week, said Retta Kekic, the Phoenix-based company’s chief marketing officer. “The initial response was, whoa, this doesn’t feel natural,” Kekic said of the idea. “How are we going to keep growing and scaling if we’re working less?” Yet employees were burning out. Qwick spent 3½ months laying the groundwork, implementing a rolling, seven-day customer-support schedule and automating more processes. It canceled many meetings and streamlined others. More than a year into the experiment, Kekic said teams such as engineering and customer-support continue to meet their internal metrics each week. Applications to fill jobs at Qwick have more than doubled. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Could you manage your workload in four days instead of five? Why or why not? Join the conversation below. To keep Monday through Thursday from feeling too intense, Qwick bosses break for lunch or organize occasional happy hours. After a decadelong career in technology, during which she would work from a coffee shop some Saturdays, Kekic said she occasionally has to remind herself not to message a colleague or her team on Fridays. For ThredUp’s Naumenko, working eight hours, four days a week doesn’t always go exactly as planned, either. Days sometimes start with a 7 a.m. call to his European teams so they don’t have to work late. Up against a project deadline or an outage, engineers may work into the three-day weekend, then take some of their unlimited vacation time to compensate, he said. He can’t imagine returning to a traditional five-day schedule. Having the extra time helped in setting up a new life in the U.S. after moving from Ukraine in January 2022, he said. His Fridays are now devoted to household chores, grocery runs and other errands. Or while the children are in school, he and his wife will go hiking or cycling. “It’s a different life also for our families,” he said.

I already spend an embarrassing amount of time slacking off daily, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m pressed for time to get stuff done in the office. I could easily meet my weekly objectives in 32 hours rather than 40, and having 3-day weekends every weekend I think would be incredible for my mental health and mood. And when I&#x27;m in a better mood, I get more work done!One thing I feel like a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is just how big a difference it is to go from a 5-day week to a 4-day week. Sure, it&#x27;s \"just one day\" but when you think about the ratio between time-on and time-off, the shift becomes a lot more dramatic. 5-on, 2-off means you spend over twice as many days working as not working. 4-on, 3-off means you spend a nearly equal number of days on each. It&#x27;s just one day of difference, but it feels like a major, major shift. reply woudsma 15 hours agoparentI feel the same. If I work 5 days I&#x27;d feel like I&#x27;m wasting so much time, when realistically I can do the same amount of work in 4 days. I&#x27;m working as a developer so it&#x27;s also about retaining my attention span. I just can&#x27;t do it for 5 days straight anymore.My perfect 4-day workweek is having the Wednesday off so I have a &#x27;mini-weekend&#x27; in my week. I only ever have to work 1 more day until I have some time to clear my head, make some music, etc. It feels like a more healthy work&#x2F;life balance. And I feel sharper after a day off. reply saulpw 14 hours agorootparentThis was true for me, I was more productive at 4-days&#x2F;week, Mon-Thu. I tried having Wed off for the reason you described, but it was hard to get into the flow, both at work and in my home life. Turns out 4 days in a row for work and 3 days in a row for home was actually better for both work productivity and personal satisfaction. reply sixstringtheory 13 hours agorootparentI would love to have Wed&#x2F;Fri as no meeting days, so I could choose which one to take off depending on how I’m feeling, what the current work streams look like, and personal plans.A three day weekend is great for a trip. Hump day off is great for a break. Either could be good for an extra day of big exercise&#x2F;recovery or deep cleaning my house.And then if working on either day, I get a full day of heads-down time. reply radiator 13 hours agorootparentprevYes. I have tried both Friday off and Wednesday off and the latter is better. Fridays at work are more relaxed anyway, so there is less value in skipping them. reply skeeter2020 10 hours agorootparentSo you&#x27;re working 3.5 days a week? This seems to go against the entire point of 4 solid days > 5 marginal days, which is how you&#x27;re describing Fridays. reply DanAtC 5 hours agorootparentSo? reply geodel 13 hours agorootparentprevSame for me. With Mon-Tues work, traffic, meetings, kids&#x27; drop off and pickup gets me drained. If there were wednesday break it&#x27;d be great. Mon-Tues hustle, a mid week break and then wrap up things on Thu-Fri. reply pseudosavant 15 hours agorootparentprevMy team currently does Monday through Thursday, although we&#x27;ve done Tuesday through Friday before too. M-Th has aligned much better with other teams in the company. It was never great when someone discovered something late of Friday or over the weekend and our team was the only one there not on Monday to help address it.That said, I wish we could go to MT and ThF schedule. Only ever have 2 days in a row with out a break would seem pretty magical to me. I&#x27;d either had yesterday off, or tomorrow - always. Fridays are such a slower day though that I feel like I miss out on less than I would on Wednesdays. reply xp84 15 hours agorootparentSame on both counts. MT_TF would be cool, but MTWT has big &#x27;economies of scale&#x27; benefits and also reduces unexpected \"asynchronous\" PTO that we get every time someone wants to take a long weekend. Essentially, almost all of our \"working days\" should then be working days when we&#x27;re all here.Ideally though the 4-day program shouldn&#x27;t be a thing only for specific teams because the \"that team isn&#x27;t here\" side-eye quickly promotes resentment of the \"lobsters pulling other lobsters back into the pot\" variety.Teams that need coverage during the full work-week (such as B2B support) should normalize having two schedules which overlap, just as B2C companies have weekend shifts (they don&#x27;t just force people to work 7 days to achieve this). reply manicennui 15 hours agoparentprevBeing fully remote gives me 6-8 hours back each week because I don&#x27;t have to commute. It has been huge for my mental health, mostly because I&#x27;m able to get more sleep. reply asciimov 15 hours agorootparent10-12 hours back a week here. Life is so much better. reply missedthecue 12 hours agoparentprevIf you spend only ~75% of your time working (i.e. you can finish your work in 32 hours instead of 40), does this imply that in the event your company switched to a 4 day workweek you would be busy 100% of the time?It seems more likely that people would retain a similar ratio of slacking to working.As an aside, how does \"I finish my work in 32 hours\" even work? What does that mean? Are most developers out there getting paint-by-numbers printouts they need to color in and then they&#x27;re all done for the week? Almost all of my roles in a professional capacity have required self-starting, and the project life cycles are much longer than a day&#x2F;week such that there is literally always work to do.If you&#x27;re building a house and you&#x27;re done nailing in shingles by noon you don&#x27;t go home and come back tomorrow, you go put up sheetrock or install bathroom tiles. The \"I finish my work in a few hours\" that I see on HN and Twitter must be extremely poorly managed teams or people that are leaving a lot of work on the rest of their teammates. reply zemvpferreira 12 hours agorootparentA lot of work, maybe more than any creative work, requires long breaks for the best output to be created. When you&#x27;re well rested, the work often comes easily and you&#x27;re hungry from it. When you&#x27;re tired, it&#x27;s a slog to get going and you&#x27;ll procrastinate your time away. The next day is even worse.I&#x27;ve managed work in software, marketing, robotics and construction. In every field I have had to send people home to rest who were doing more harm than good with their tired decision-making. Doing the work that was set for the day and going home to rest is a great productivity and morale boost, in my opinion.Individual work capacity varies, but in my experience most people overestimate theirs by a lot. reply j7ake 5 hours agorootparent> A lot of work, maybe more than any creative work, requires long breaks for the best output to be created.There are many counter examples against this statement. Stephen King writes every day with no breaks, not even on Sundays. reply zemvpferreira 1 hour agorootparentFrom a recent interview he seems to write 2 to 4 hours per day, every day. That adds up to anywhere between 15 and 30 hours per week.Personal work capacity will vary. Who knows, maybe he&#x27;d write better books if he wrote less? We&#x27;ll likely never know. reply BolexNOLA 11 hours agorootparentprevThe argument is that if people work fewer hours per week, then they will spend less time slacking off. And the numbers so far show that to be true. reply scarab92 5 hours agorootparentOver the short term.My concern is that people are consciously avoiding slacking off during the trial period but will later return to their long-run productivity once they grow accustomed to 32 hour weeks.The other concern I have with these studies, is that these companies appear to be overstaffed in the first place. While we all have some amount of slack during our days, I doubt anyone in my team has enough slack available to get the same amount of work done in 4 days.I’d want to see a long term study that involves lean companies and people in leas-creative roles before buying into the hype. reply zingababba 14 hours agoparentprevSame, it has always blown my mind how I&#x27;m consistently one of the most productive members on any team I&#x27;ve been on yet I know how much time I spend just idling. It&#x27;s the spurts of activity where I get my work done and time off 100% correlates with the intensity and length of those spurts&#x2F;flow states. reply b1gnasty 13 hours agoparentprevI used to work manual labour in the reforestation industry and there were two main schedules we would work: 4-and-1s (criminal) and 3-and-1s (manageable). That change in ratio really adds up.Sadly, management mostly worked us 4-and-1s because, despite the fact that each day we were less productive, over 3 months more trees would get planted in less time.4-and-1s of gruelling manual labour inevitably leads to burn out. It did every season without fail, and we all expected it. Burnout was a built-in condition. The key here is that labour tolerated it only because the work was seasonal. There was always an end in sight. And most folks spent the off-season on a beach somewhere it was cheap enough to live off the earnings, surfing and eating tacos all day (or the equivalent activity).The salaryperson should not accept burn out as a built-in; we are labourers for life and we need to learn how to find dignity in such a reality. When I first transitioned to a salaried worker, I brought the burn out mentality to my work and had a lot of pride in that. And though full of bride, the burnt out husk that I as had little dignity.Ratios that allow for more life and less labour is that dignity. reply timmg 15 hours agoparentprev> I already spend an embarrassing amount of time slacking off daily, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m pressed for time to get stuff done in the office.Just because that is true for you doesn&#x27;t mean it is true in general. Like, imagine a surgeon -- would he&#x2F;she spend 8 hours a week slacking? Or a radiologoist -- can he&#x2F;she read the same number of slides in 32 than 40? Or a barrista at starbucks?Also, if you worked 32 hours, would you still slack off? Is there a reason to expect that your slack&#x2F;work ratio would change? You claim you&#x27;d be \"in a better mood\" -- but as humans we tend to adjust to the circumstances we are in. So I&#x27;m not sure that would be the case long term. reply flardartbhhgg 15 hours agorootparentDo you have any idea how much break time surgeons take? Tons of them work 3day weeks because it’s more efficient. The rest of their time is either at home or “in clinic” doing busywork.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.studentdoctor.net&#x2F;threads&#x2F;3-day-work-week-wit...I suspect you’ve pulled “surgeon” from you-know-where on account of it being a high-status, high-value role. But don’t bring that baggage into the conversation. reply freedomben 15 hours agorootparentI think you were a little harsher than necessary, but this is a good point. Surgeons aren&#x27;t doing surgery 40 hours a week. They&#x27;d be making tons of mistakes if they did that and they&#x27;d be getting burned out. The last surgery I had the doc only did ops on Tuesdays and Fridays.In many ways it&#x27;s a good analogy to writing code 40 hours a week. It takes high concentration and the quality of output drops heavily when you&#x27;re tired or need a break or rest. reply szundi 2 hours agorootparentWhat I see here that they completely exhaust thenselves with working in several hospitals parallel, consiliums etc, then they go do surgeries in between reply dmoy 15 hours agorootparentprevAlso my radiologist neighbor works 3 day workweeks in 12 hour shifts I think. Or used to. I forget the details. So that example from GP doesn&#x27;t make sense to me either. reply DoesntMatter22 12 hours agorootparent3x12 doesn&#x27;t seem too bad to me. You are zonked after but 4 days off is pretty sweet. reply hgdfhgfdhgdf 10 hours agorootparentprev\"Residents can work up to an average of 80 hours per week. The aforementioned general surgeons work an average of 60.78 hours. Meanwhile, orthopedic surgeons work an average of 54.17 hours per week, and plastic surgeons operate just under 50 hours per week.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitecoatinvestor.com&#x2F;how-many-hours-do-doctors-.... reply skeeter2020 10 hours agorootparentprevand yet you describe in-clinic work as \"busywork\". Pre&#x2F;post op is super important, actually having to deal with human beings... this actually sounds a lot like software developers who could use a little more practice with the non-coding aspects of their jobs. reply flardartbhhgg 4 hours agorootparentBusy work when compared to literally manually cutting and sewing someone’s organs to make sure they stay alive, yes. reply manicennui 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you&#x27;ve spent any time in the corporate world, I think you know that the majority of people slack off for part of the day. The medical profession has its own set of time problems that I don&#x27;t think should be conflated with the time problems in the corporate world.Your second point is definitely valid. Changing habits is really hard, and some of us are able to get by while spending very little time doing work because we work so much more quickly than the average drone. reply bluefishinit 15 hours agorootparentprev\"Slacking off\" doesn&#x27;t enter into the equation. Is your output worth more to the company than it costs to pay you to produce it? If yes, then great there is no problem to be solved. reply TylerE 15 hours agorootparentOne way to think of it is that you&#x27;re not always being paid to be doing something specific, but rather to be available on short (e.g. 15 minutes or less) notice. reply Draiken 15 hours agorootparentSure, some roles require that, but most definitely not the majority.In development at least, most of the times I hear this, the \"availability\" is only needed for random unplanned meetings from useless managers that can&#x27;t actually plan or work asynchronously.The organization as a whole or individual managers can&#x27;t do their jobs well and they make the people that actually get shit done pay for it by \"standing by\" for no good reason.Ironically, they also completely ruin productivity with these interruptions. reply __blockcipher__ 15 hours agorootparent> In development at least, most of the times I hear this, the \"availability\" is only needed for random unplanned meetings from useless managers that can&#x27;t actually plan or work asynchronously.Really? Because it&#x27;s pretty routine for me to get pinged on IRC&#x2F;slack&#x2F;whatever by another engineer who&#x27;s looking for help with something. Obviously I set the expectation that I&#x27;m not going to be able to instantly reply to every ping so some things are going to have to be async, but there&#x27;s definitely a lot more than just managers that could ping me. reply Draiken 14 hours agorootparentAre those pings that require immediate attention? In my experience, no.The vast majority of time in my career, if you have a minimum amount of decent planning, you won&#x27;t get blocked because you can&#x27;t talk to another person immediately. And on healthy organizations, even if you do get blocked, you can simply work on something else while that particular task is blocked.If you really scrutinize all these availability claims, they pretty much all come down to lack of planning.Planning for blockers, planning for communication gaps, planning for maximizing asynchronous work, planning for decisions that require specific people, etc.So many people are horrified by the word \"blocked\" when it&#x27;s most times an artificial block created by their own systems. If I can&#x27;t move forward on something, I&#x27;ll start on something else and come back to the other one later. reply jlkuester7 12 hours agorootparentThis. If you have a high-functioning team with good async culture&#x2F;habits, in my experience \"blockers\" are not a big deal. I work closely with 5 other people and we are in 6 different time zones and I can honestly say that we are more productive than teams I have worked with in a traditional office setting. Sure, I cannot just walk over to a teammate&#x27;s desk and ask a question, but I also don&#x27;t have anyone walking over to my desk to interrupt me with a question.We are all intentional about _over communicating_ what we are working on and where we will need support from from each other. Everything else pretty much just flows naturally from that. There are (rare) times were I cannot progress on something that day because I need feedback from someone who will not be online for 10 more hours, but it is just a built-in assumption that this will happen and I always have other work queued up that I can do if I get stuck.... reply BeetleB 14 hours agorootparentprev> Because it&#x27;s pretty routine for me to get pinged on IRC&#x2F;slack&#x2F;whatever by another engineer who&#x27;s looking for help with something.That&#x27;s why when we were all colocated in one building, I was logged out. I made it clear they were welcome to drop by my cube whenever they wanted, but I would not be available by IM. It cut the interrupts by half, easily. People use you as a crutch. When you raise the cost even minimally, they are suddenly willing to solve their own problems.That&#x27;s the one aspect that COVID destroyed. Now I have to be online as people can&#x27;t just walk to my cube. reply owenmarshall 13 hours agorootparentWhat I have started to do is to block an hour every other day, and when someone sends me a Slack message that feels like I am just their crutch, I snooze it until that scheduled block of time. It works like a charm. I still keep an eye on the urgent questions that I have to answer quickly, and many questions have evaporated by the time I come back to them. reply paradox242 2 hours agorootparentThis is another skill that like knowing when to say no, seems counterintuitive when first entering the working world. Sometimes the correct answer is not to drop everything and slowly explain something for the third time that would have been trivial to Google in the first place. You are not doing yourself or them any favors by being overly available for every little question. The kind of person that does this often has a kind of learned helplessness that they need to be shaken out of from time to time. reply Paul-Craft 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not about who can ping you. It&#x27;s about the expectation of urgency behind that ping. A \"ping\" from a manager calling an unexpected meeting demands a lot more attention than a ping from a colleague looking for help most of the time. reply aetherson 15 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s an opportunity cost question. If your output is worth more to the company than your costs, but it would be easy for them to hire someone at the same cost who has more output, then you&#x27;re at risk. reply munk-a 13 hours agorootparentPeople are not replaceable parts. HR would absolutely love it if all developer 3s were the same - and it should be the case that one developer 3 is more like another developer 3 than a developer 2 - but people are different and have their own quirks and strengths.And, of course, you&#x27;re ignoring training costs which are usually a big factor in companies that aren&#x27;t incompetent. That Senior Dev that&#x27;s 15% above marketing asking rate but who knows your system inside and out... do you really want to spend six years training a (potentially highly proficient) newbies on all your systems and the subtle intricacies. And how long will it be until you, the manager, trust that new Senior Dev like you did the old? How many fires will you both need to walk through until you see an availability alert and just trust the Senior Dev either is dealing with it or would be ringing your phone if they need extra resources?It can take quite a while to get a new employee (again, even a highly proficient one) to that place where in a meet your product team can be going over a proposal and your Senior Dev raises there hand and proceeds to calmly explain the incompatibility with the current system and how much it will cost to overcome those incompatibilities - and if they remain silent then you know they&#x27;ve done those calculations and consider it in hand.Hiring a replacement is an extremely complicated calculations that most companies just punt on - for good reason. reply krapp 8 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of people have been replaceable parts since the days of Henry Ford. If you&#x27;re not one of those people, congratulations on your privilege, but I bet you&#x27;re not as irreplaceable as you might believe. reply bluefishinit 13 hours agorootparentprev> but it would be easy for them to hire someone at the same cost who has more outputHistory has shown that it&#x27;s not easy at all to replace someone. It&#x27;s difficult to find good people and convince them to join you and it can take a long time. If you can write code, you should always have the upper hand on your employer especially if your co-workers also realize that. reply abujazar 14 hours agorootparentprevIt does enter the equation, because idle time «working» or slacking off at work could be better spent pursuing other interests that improve quality of life and most likely increase productivity over time. reply bluefishinit 13 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think this time should be labeled as \"slacking off\". It&#x27;s just not working and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that if you&#x27;ve already met your obligations. reply com2kid 15 hours agorootparentprev> Just because that is true for you doesn&#x27;t mean it is true in general.

The time to commute should be count against that 40 hours and yet we exclude it.

Prefer having about 12 hours of continual time when implementing a new feature or working a new solution. This allows for laying out the solution and better refactoring to make it cleaner. 9:00 to 17:00 does not allow for this because continual thoughts have to be shelved for the next day which takes more energy and time to try and rev-up again to continue where one left off.To be far, a CEO or President or Owner or Manager seeing you in the office is a social engineering hack. \"They are there so they must be doing work, I&#x27;m getting what I payed for.\" reply paulryanrogers 11 hours agorootparentMy guess is it&#x27;s because the commute is really up to the employee.

If I need to get ahold of my man in Chicago I thankfully have the clearance at work to come in an hour or two later in exchange for having an hour or two which matches his timezone.

Different strokes, I guess. reply IKantRead 16 hours agoparentprevI like this better in theory, but my experience is that, given my current hours, work tends to very frequently spill over until later in the evening. If my day was supposed to end at 3 or even noon I don&#x27;t think it would make a practical impact on how late I worked.Work spilling over into extra days does happen during crunch times, but is much rarer. Though I likewise fear that 4 day work weeks would simply mean you end up working 8-8 everyday to get the same amount of stuff done. reply hackermatic 15 hours agoprevI have a four-day, 32-hour work week, and I am less productive, but that was the plan up front and I&#x27;m very okay with that (and luckily, so is my management).I wanted more personal time, and I also needed more time to take care of my physical and mental health with appointments -- which all of my providers schedule during the 9-AM-to-5-PM period anyway -- and simple rest and relaxation. If I didn&#x27;t have this schedule, there&#x27;s a good chance I wouldn&#x27;t still be at this current job or would have burned out earlier in general, and my contributions are valued, so it works out well for all parties involved.But I don&#x27;t think you have to justify it so concretely or morally -- you can just want to do a day&#x27;s less formal work, or want to work toward a society with less work and more leisure time! The 40-hour work week is arbitrary, anyway. reply el_benhameen 14 hours agoparentDid you exchange the extra hours for a cut in pay? reply hackermatic 14 hours agorootparentYes, so I get 80% of the normal salary for my role, but the same benefits package (insurance, 401(k) match, etc.). reply statquontrarian 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve had a 3 day work week for years (at 20 hours per week) and I love it.

I had heard about the 30 hour per week cutoff for benefits, but I was surprised that my company was able to provide full benefits at 20 hours per week. It&#x27;s a very large company, so I know they&#x27;re following all the laws properly. Maybe the ones that require a minimum of 30 simply aren&#x27;t up-to-date on the latest laws.It probably helps to be a top performer and have years of experience. But if I were to be let go tomorrow, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be difficult to find again. But I&#x27;m going to try! Never hurts to try when you know what you want.I keep a low profile but the extra days per week are fun to fill! There does seem to be some sort of mental flip between 3 days and 4 days because I know that the majority of my week is whatever I want to do versus the majority (or vast majority) being work. reply nkozyra 16 hours agoprevI think of a \"work week\" as a bit of a fishbowl situation for most professionals. If you extend it from 40 hours to 80 hours you&#x27;ll generally get the same output over time.Of course, this productivity can only be squeezed into only so small a frame, but I think what we&#x27;re learning is that 40 hours is probably not the maxima for efficiency.The simplest way to have more efficient workers is to make them happy. I don&#x27;t have a panacea for that problem, but giving them an extra day for leisure sure doesn&#x27;t hurt when possible. But more than that, companies rarely ask and listen to employees about what they want&#x2F;need, and there&#x27;s so much social pressure that people seldom speak up. Fundamentally this is a cultural problem. reply philfreo 14 hours agoprevAt Close we have been offering an 80% salary &#x2F; 4-day week option for engineering roles for a few years now. This originally was mandatory during early 2020 COVID-19 economic uncertainty as a way to cut costs without doing layoffs. Quickly it became optional – most people moved back to 100% but some people decided they enjoyed it and wanted to continue that arrangement.What&#x27;s interesting about 4d weeks is that it&#x27;s 20% less work but 50% more days off, which can be very impactful for folks.Our 80% option is a flexible thing, as in you can choose to do it for the summer but not the rest of the year. We try to adjust workloads accordingly. I&#x27;ve taken advantage of it myself for a period of time and it gave me more free time to be with family and also work on side projects.Some people really love taking our 80% option &#x2F; 4d and others absolutely don&#x27;t want to.Companies offering flexibility in work hours can really help retention IMO, and is a natural progression after (a) remote &#x2F; freedom of location, and (b) freedom of specific work schedule.I know a few companies offer \"4-day week summers\" to everybody or even \"everyone always does 4-day weeks\". But I like the \"fairness\" of giving people an option, since different people are in different life situations at different times where working more vs. less can be especially helpful. reply wnolens 14 hours agoparent> This originally was mandatory during early 2020 COVID-19 economic uncertainty as a way to cut costs without doing layoffs.I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;ve never heard of this solution before.

Some companies claim to have a 4 day work week schedule, when in fact they simply negotiate an equal reduction in salary.The point of working less is for people to have more personal time without this impacting their livelihood. There are many well-studied benefits of this[1], both to workers and companies, yet greedy companies still cling to archaic practices to squeeze as much profits as possible out of each employee.Even after considerable productivity increases gained in part by automation and technology, we&#x27;ve seen decades of wage stagnation and an increasing productivity-pay gap[2,3,4]. Workers have lived with this short end of the stick for far too long, and the least controversial step forward would be to make the 4 day work week without pay reduction a general policy in all companies in nonessential industries. There are industries that need to operate with longer schedules, and those positions should be compensated accordingly, but most IT companies can certainly operate with much less than 5 days per week.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;6256741&#x2F;four-day-work-week-benefits&#x2F;[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Decoupling_of_wages_from_produ...[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;publication&#x2F;charting-wage-stagnation&#x2F;[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epi.org&#x2F;productivity-pay-gap&#x2F; reply GGO 16 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;C6qmf reply brtkdotse 15 hours agoprevSince becoming a freelancing contractor I’ve experimented a fair bit with my work week and for me the sweet spot is 5 6-hour days, split up as 2x90min, 2 hour lunch and another 2x90min.I prefer a five day workweek with shorter days because I rarely have 8 good hours in me.

Some days there&#x27;s more in the tank or whatever problem is interesting and I can&#x27;t put the laptop down. Some days I&#x27;m done by 3 pm because I&#x27;m not getting anything done.

Based on my internal notes (and a bunch of metrics) I am more productive on Friday (especially afternoons) than I am on a given Tuesday afternoon. There&#x27;s a ton of other variables and probably some contraindications in that anecdote, but it&#x27;s the kind of counter-intuitive result that a 4-day work week is based on.I&#x27;m also amazed at how variable an hour can be in terms of output. I can easily do 5-10x work at my best compared to my worst. The key here is being completely in the zone, and not trying to do it all the time.I believe a 4-day work week could help put more people in that productive zone,resulting in as much&#x2F;more output for less hours spent. Of course, you have to have employees trusting enough and stable enough to use the extra time to decompress. reply atleastoptimal 16 hours agoprevIf I was asked to test a four-day work week, I would work harder and more efficient than I usually would to make a four-day work week look like a better option, even if it wasn&#x27;t. reply Quinzel 3 hours agoprevI currently only work 4 days a week.

If I do, it&#x27;s on my side-business and it&#x27;s by choice.The problem with these 4-day work weeks is that you are imposing your lifestyle changes on potential employers by expecting to get paid more for working less.

We make pretty decent money, but only because of our absurd overtime, so some people in the industry are actually against reducing our hours to a more reasonable 40 because it will substantially decrease their take home pay.And with inflation eating into our wages, we make less and less every year.

    "originBody": "HomePostsAbout| Visual node graph with ImGui 28 Sep 2023 I wanted my first post on this blog to be about the node graph system that I created for my personal graphics engine named “RogueEngine”. I may talk about the engine itself in another post but for now I’d like to focus on its UI. As a teaser, here’s a screenshot of the tool running our Revision 2023 demo: Intro sequence from Reality Check. A bit of background I started thinking about this project back in 2019 with the aim of releasing some PC demo productions. I had heard of the demoscene for the first time about four years earlier through some coworkers at Sony and it gradually grew on me to the point that I too wanted to participate. I really wanted to be able to team up with artists and designers for making these rather than, say, other programmers or trying to complete a production on my own. This seemed like a better way to reach a higher visual bar as well as being more entertaining overall. 🙂 This translated in my mind to having an interface that anyone could use for interacting with and tweaking the content, although in retrospect, such a system comes in extremely handy for programmers too and I find myself increasingly using it for many purposes, such as research and experimentation. Regardless, I started looking into interfaces for visual content creation, which were at the time both quite fascinating and mysterious to me having little to no experience with such systems. I was initially not particularly fond of node graphs however, for mainly two reasons: Many of these systems seemed to be what I’d call “coding with nodes”; while it may be more visual, it isn’t fundamentally any simpler. It can get real messy real fast. Courtesy of blueprints from hell. Node systems were still appealing to me however for different reasons; they felt more intuitive and less intimidating than other solutions with more “traditional” UI and they tend to look really nice on screenshots. Then maybe it’ll be easier for me to convince other people to get on board? 🙂 So I started thinking about a node system that would not be “coding with nodes”. Node system Having little to no experience with node-based systems, I went ahead and looked at other software for inspiration. Big sources of inspiration for me would be software such as Blender, Notch, and Godot. In particular, I was wondering how to create a system that’d be both easy to use and expressive enough to allow the creation of interesting and emergent effects rather than simply ticking available engine features on or off… Towards the end of 2019, something somewhat cliked in my mind; I’d design the system to have only two types of nodes (okay, three) and they’d work like this: The root node from which the graph traversal would start at runtime. The data node representing a piece of data of a given type. The component node that can be attached to a data node to modify it. The different node types. This seemingly simple setup seemed to open up a lot of possibilities. 🙂 I could have some “geometry data node” being nothing more than an index and a vertex buffer (plus some bounding box and probably other things…) while a “component node” connected to it would act as some kind of vertex shader that could be used for displacement purposes. Similarly, a “shading data node” could represent a standard material while a “component node” would be some piece of code to be injected into the fragment shader for various per-pixel procedural shading effects. This felt like a good solution; I could instantly see how most features could map to this setup and it most definitely wasn’t a visual programming system… As an illustration, here’s a collection of the different node categories available in the engine at the time of writing: The available node categories in RogueEngine. The great thing about this approach is that the dependent nodes do not need to know how the data from the data node came to be (in the case of the geometry category, it could be a procedurally-generated mesh, geometry loaded through some glTF file, or even metaballs generated from the particle system), the format of the data node being fixed (in this case, an index and a vertex buffer…), we always know how to operate on it. 🙂 Metaballs created using the nodes, a classic of the demoscene. Data model vs. GUI code Now that I knew how my node system would operate, I had to find how to implement it. My plan was to use Dear ImGui for the UI because it’s a joy to use and, I have to admit, I had little intention of investigating other GUI solutions. ImGui is actually a great fit I found to crafting such a creative UI system. The main insight to take away in my opinion is the need to separate the data (what I’d call the data model) from the UI logic (often referred to as the view). Having such a separation naturally implies creating an interface for iterating the data inside your “project” that can then be used both by the runtime, when playing back the demo content, and the ImGui code, when running the editor. Our first step should therefore be to define that data model, so here goes: Data model for RogueEngine’s runtime. There are essentially only three types of resources that a user can interact with through the interface and manipulate within a project (along with a few more as detailed below…): Assets: A list of all your imported 3D models, textures, music files, etc. Layers: These allow to group nodes, mostly to facilitate multi-scene projects. Nodes: Nodes belong to their parent layer and can be executed by the runtime. Furthermore, Ranges represent the series of time segments for when a particular resource is active on the timeline, while Properties represent, as the name suggests, the properties of a given node, such as values and colors, links to assets and/or other nodes, etc. Having such a clearly defined data model makes it easy to serialize and deserialize the content of a project (for saving and loading purposes respectively) as we can rely on a well identified distinction between what should be persisted vs. what’s engine specific. The timeline panel allows the edition of ranges, i.e., when is a node or layer active or not. Finally, such a setup makes it rather simple to implement dreaded (but oh so useful!) features such as undo/redo. I picked the same approach than @voxagonlabs and went ahead with serializing the whole project on every change to the data model. This may sound rather inefficient (and I’m sure it won’t hold up past certain project sizes…) but there isn’t really all that much data you typically have to serialize when saving a project. So it’s definitely good enough for now and makes undo/redo indeed trivial to manage. 🙂 Animating the scene Next stop on the road was to get things moving. My plan here was to allow keyframing any property that’s either a float or a vector of floats (e.g., vec2, vec3, vec4). For this task, I pretty much mimicked Blender and added a “K” button next to all keyframe-able properties. Once enabled, the property field would turn green, while modifying it would insert a new keyframe at the current frame index, turning the field orange to highlight the change. I also found I had to disable the editing of keyframed properties during playback (something that’s otherwise possible and a great way to tweak the rendering of a scene) so as to avoid inserting what’d be one keyframe per frame. 🙂 Finally, I decided to have the timeline content be encoded for a 24Hz target frequency, meaning you could only ever store up to 24 keyframes inside a given second. This is fine however, as we can simply turn our frame index into a floating-point number and interpolate between keyframes if the demo ends up running at higher framerates. Points on a curve; still doing basic linear interpolation, cubic spline coming soon™. One more thing I added was this “M” button, which you can see next to the keyframe toggle in the inspector panel. Toggling it makes the property appear as a pin onto the node itself in the graph. The user can then plug in other nodes and modify the property procedurally (adding the elapsed time in seconds, multiplying with a sine wave or noise function, etc.). This is a great tool for continuous, repeating, or random animation. Things that would otherwise be a pain to do with editing a curve. As it turns out, we ended up using this functionality way more than the curve editor itself! This probably goes some way as to explaining why this view is the only part of the UI that hasn’t been completed yet… Code nodes I’ve mentioned throughout this post that I was mostly trying to steer away from visual programming, but we may still want to allow the use of coding for these moments where built-in nodes aren’t quite flexible enough. Instead of “coding with nodes” however, here you’d simply create a “code node” letting you write actual text inside a field (or copy/paste from Shadertoy!). You can then add “bindings” to create tweakable properties that can be accessed directly from the shader: Code node with animated binding. Oh, and these properties are just like any other node property, so they too can be animated and/or plugged into other nodes… 🙂 Conclusion I hope this overview was useful, don’t hesitate to reach out or leave a comment! © 2023 Guillaume Boissé.

More work on, and thought put into, visual scripting systems!This looks really great! I&#x27;m not sure I agree with the conclusions, nor the need for a different system than what Blueprints or Geometry Nodes offer. Personally, I think both of those things are great save for the major (and infinitely complex) feature of \"clean this board up\". The nature of the graphs make it easy to see when code repeats or is doing too much, just so long as the graph, itself, is legible. So if you could have some smart snapping, to force devs to keep it tight, or if you could employ some kind of machine learning for cleaning it up into sensible data flows, I think most of the biggest complaints I&#x27;ve heard from people who actually use these systems, would be addressed.That aside, I&#x27;m always open to a new way! I, again, don&#x27;t think what was demo&#x27;d is any cleaner than Blueprints (especially not fond of all of those connection points. Bottom and top connections don&#x27;t look tidy), but that is definitely in the eye of the beholder, and this appears to be a well-delivered first attempt, but a first attempt nonetheless, so I&#x27;ll assume that whatever visual issues I have with it, the underlying scheme works well. Because, honestly, it looks like it does! As presented, I think the system would definitely work great and it would certainly make a few things easier than how they&#x27;re handled elsewhere. I&#x27;ll admit, &#x27;curry it to a specific data type and then operate on that&#x27; is how I code anyway, so I&#x27;m biased toward liking it. But I like that methodology because I think it works exceptionally well, especially for work like rendering. So great work on both the full app and this whole new way of scripting! reply hermitcrab 21 hours agoparent> or if you could employ some kind of machine learningI&#x27;m not sure machine learning is appropriate for graph layout. What a good graph looks like is already well known: no overlapping nodes, minimum line crosses, not too much &#x27;white space&#x27;. But doing this layout automatically is very hard (NP complete?). reply catapart 21 hours agorootparentSorry if I was unclear: I just meant that we could employ tensor-based learning methodology, like ChatGPT uses, to parse the graph representations and understand not only their visual layout (ex: no lines crossing), but also their contexts (ex: group functions that all emit events near each other on the graph). Having a machine be able to know what you&#x27;re trying to do and then clean it up to based on that would be great. Even better, if it could learn how you tend to organize things and pick up \"configurations\" from that. Adding in \"reroute nodes\" and stuff when things start looking too loose for your personal liking, or whatever. reply rperez333 10 hours agorootparentI would also love to have an auto layout that considers more than just uncrossing lines. I spent some time trying to find a solution for organizing Nuke node graphs (for VFX) that would follow a few additional rules, but I didn&#x27;t get very far. Not a perfect example, but getting something along these lines would be ideal: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;headjack.io&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;Huge_script-1... reply hermitcrab 21 hours agorootparentprevWouldn&#x27;t that need an awful lot of training data? And different people might have very approaches to laying out a graph, so all that training data would need to come from one person, wouldn&#x27;t it? reply catapart 19 hours agorootparentOh, for sure! It would need to be trained on the &#x27;default&#x27; way of doing things, just like a linter has a default config. THEN it would need to train on how you code (pin ordering, reroute node layouts, loop layouts, etc), the entire time you work with it. And, of course, in order to train, you would need to be able to tell it \"hey, don&#x27;t do that; I know I did it here but don&#x27;t mimic that\" as well as \"mimic this, every single time. Don&#x27;t use the defaults\". Those explicit commands are extremely important for handling the edge casing (similar to newline vs inline brace openings).But, honestly, that kind of thing is the only valuable future for AI that I see, as a creative. I don&#x27;t need it to write my code for me, but I could sure as hell use it to handle all the tedious bullshit that we&#x27;ve cobbled together as far as tooling, CI, formatting and any other \"had to do it this way to make machines understand it\" half-measure we&#x27;ve had to take in the past century. The AIs that we see, now, which learn from a huge dataset and then stay mostly inert until the next big update are more toy-like in my figuring. They are standards to measure against and proofs of all kinds of very interesting and useful concepts. But the lasting&#x2F;useful AIs will be the ones that train alongside your work and ONLY on your work (or, let&#x27;s face it, the work done in your company that will be shared amongst all corporate employees so that all work can be done more efficiently) in order to provide you with what you would be trying to do anyway. reply CyberDildonics 11 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn&#x27;t make any sense. There are already lots of graph UIs that can auto layout. Why would you need &#x27;tensor-based learning&#x27; to uncross lines? reply bmitc 3 hours agorootparent> There are already lots of graph UIs that can auto layout.Do you have any references besides Graphviz?

It&#x27;s an open source library for visually programming on the GPU.

No need for wrappers[4]. For rendering vvvv uses the Stride [5] game engine which comes with a really neat shader system &#x2F; language which is basically a superset of HLSL [6]. In vvvv those shaders are represented as nodes and you can open them in your favorite text editor directly from the vvvv evironment, edit the code, save and the changed result will instantly be loaded in vvvv[7].

When it touches a node, then the node is selected. But then you can hold ctrl to jump from one node to another, if they’re aligned.Kind of like excel, how you browse multiple tables in the same grid. reply hoc 20 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;d think that also helps in a lot of pointer-based editing use cases: Creation, selection, grouping&#x2F;clustering, sorting, transforms... reply samsquire 22 hours agoprevLooks really good, thank you for sharing.I enjoy graphs, you can think of the world wide web as a graph. When you click a link you get a different perspective of that vertice.My dream is to combine nodal rendering to animated field of view layout.In all the attempts I&#x27;ve seen to create an interactive 3D graph the problem was that moving around didn&#x27;t change the perspective and paging in and out of the nodal elements.Navigating a graph where the graphs aren&#x27;t moved relevantly while you walk around is not useful it&#x27;s like manual labour of walking to the store, the nodes need to change perspective, animate into different variations as you move around and page in and out different edges and vertices.The algorithm you use to move&#x2F;page nodes in and out and around has to be dependent on what you&#x27;re doing. reply rossant 12 hours agoprevImGui is an amazing piece of software.

Sometimes it is the entire authoring environment.Text coding benefits from standardised tools that are decoupled from the applications they serve and interoperability. You want to write your Rust in nano? Go right ahead? Want to write some lua that does bulk edits to your COBOL library. Fab.More importantly is that we learn the tools and keyboard shortcuts and those skills transfer to new languages and environments.The main issues would be mitigated by:a) some standardized UI conventionsb) all visual programming tools offering lossless round-tripping to textual representation (it doesn&#x27;t have to be tuned for human writability - it just needs to be sane)B also helps with the other big flaw with visual programming - the way it breaks version control workflows. I heard from an Unreal dev that even opening a blueprint and highlighting a different node will change the file. That must be fun when it comes time to merge...I could write reams on this topic. I want visual programming to be better - I think it has unique strengths. But currently it has two niches:1. People that can&#x27;t bring themselves to learn text-based coding.2. Tasks where discoverability and immediacy trump all the disadvantages. reply Towaway69 1 hour agoparentSomething I realised recently is that \"visual code\" can represent different paradigms. If you use Node-RED[2] than the visual code presents events and data movements. If you use something like Blender nodes or Noisecraft[1] then the visual code presents a state machine which is always on.It helps to think of unix pipes when working with Node-RED, but when working with state machines to think of wiring on a circuit board. I wrote down my ideas in blog[3] - if anyone has more representation, please share![1]=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noisecraft.app&#x2F; [2]=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodered.org [3]=https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.openmindmap.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;pipes-wires-nodes reply hoc 20 hours agoparentprevWell, for a node oriented approach we could have standard auto layouting that we could augment with hints for grouping, layouting prioritization etc. to achieve some kind of \"universal editing\" approach for visual programming.After all, we use lots of comments to give some structure to text-based coding.There was a post about https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;samuelmtimbo&#x2F;unit recently, which at least uses some kind of hinted auto-layout (besides the more propriety fancy)I really want to see more graphical coding for years, but node&#x2F;graph-based and blockly seem to be the only approaches that got sone traction so far. So I like this thread and it seems at the right place.I&#x27;d wish to see more use of 2D and now 3D space for structuring, annotation and overall overview and navigation. Text plus a directory tree view can&#x27;t be everything, especially since we have so many structural views for coding, runtime, versioning that basically are connected in our mind, but also could be in a space with more dimensions. Not sure if we could find&#x2F;agree on a common denominator, though. Text is one because it&#x27;s basically the bottom of common ground. Not sure if that&#x27;s not just the trivial solution (ok, I am). reply SanderNL 21 hours agoparentprevHow is this different from “drawing is better than writing a book”?Some people write, others draw. Each method has its own strength and problem spaces.Encoding a complex issue sometimes is just shitty with a visual metaphor. Other times writing code is a really bad idea. If you want to express “flow” or “connections”, filter or stream systems like modular synths, that’s when the visual metaphor shines.You use whatever metaphor works best at the moment. One cannot replace the other.The “problem” is that people want to push all of “programming” into the visual metaphor. That’s like pushing all of programming into only functional, only declarative, only imperative or only OOP (or whatever), but worse. That’s not going to work, but I guess people can try. reply hermitcrab 21 hours agorootparentYes, attempting to re-implement generic programming (as opposed to a particular domain) as node-based seems doomed to failure. reply steve_adams_86 19 hours agorootparentI agree. I love modelling state machines in node-based systems, and I think user interfaces could be fine in node-based editors (I’ve never tried, but they’re already node-based internally and they seem well-suited in the same way state machines are). But I’d hate to model something like a flow of concurrent tasks with retries and exponential back offs or something where the visual queues don’t seem like they’d be obvious and the editor couldn’t (as far as I can imagine) offer useful simulation or testing tools.It could be a failure of my imagination. I’ve designed similar things though, and these weird cases (especially temporal cases) become extremely hard to represent more universally. I suppose you could offer a “timeline” to indicate how things would behave on a time scale, but even that… I just don’t know.It also seems key to have a node-based editor work with one language or a set which map together extremely well. reply hoc 14 hours agorootparentOTOH, whenever somebody is explaining their multithreaded async code lines on a web page or in a book, there a graph is shown, since it seems to be the ideal metaphor. Just not for implementation purposes...?There&#x27;s definitively some hard limitation in dimension, though, so there might be the idea that, if one can only show problems of a certain limited complexity visually, why not do all the lousy (text-based, relational&#x2F;reference-based way) but universal way that at least can be stored and edited everywhere.So a central question might be: can we have a universal gain from, let&#x27;s say, a three dimensional notation that still does not limit the problem space to these dimension. reply fiddlerwoaroof 18 hours agorootparentprevWe already have had good UI designers, they just never made it to the web. reply steve_adams_86 17 hours agorootparentAs a UI designer (at times), I have to say...

Computers used to be like that: everything was tied to the OS and compiler. That didn&#x27;t stop banks from developing pretty complex systems.IMO, the problem is that visual programming, despite its name, is visually a mess. You can&#x27;t read it, you can&#x27;t orient yourself in it. It&#x27;s not structured, for starters. And piping an input through a sin function takes up 10 times the screen space of Math.sin(x), especially if you then have to keep that node&#x27;s output from overlapping other parts. And you always must search back where the input to a node comes from, whereas in textual programs, you can put that information in the variable name. It&#x27;s just not suitable to our way of thinking in chunks. reply pjmlp 19 hours agorootparentThat is the outcome of people coding in visual languages like BASIC, instead of making use of the structure programming tooling, that they also offer. reply mschaef 15 hours agoparentprev> Off topic (and a bit \"hijack someone&#x27;s post\") but I keep thinking about the inherent suckiness of visual programming and what needs to happen to improve it.Visual programming presents huge challenges.> Text coding benefits from standardised toolsThat&#x27;s the biggest, IMO. Some degree of text processing is essentially universal to computing after the early 1950&#x27;s. As you mention, that provides a huge amount of prior art in editors, source code control systems, various kinds of messaging, display tools... the list goes on and on. Textual languages can natively reuse all of this. Graphical languages need some sort of mapping to text in order to use tools that do not quite fit the way they work.The other challenge is the way visual programming complicates the mechanics of the job. Laying source out in (~) one dimension is hard, laying it out in two dimensions is harder. Naming a function is hard, drawing a representative icon for a function is harder.You also lose the notion of linear ordering when you move from a list of statements to a 2D graph of nodes. This is useful when you&#x27;re modeling a data flow graph or a state machine, but harder when you want to express a branch or a loop. reply WillAdams 19 hours agoparentprevThe problem here is that a fundamental question has not been answered, and as far as I can tell, has not been addressed by any of these visual environments:What does an algorithm look like?Herman Hesse alluded to this in his novel _The Glass Bead Game_, but despite decades of discussion and work, no one has made a convincing pysical representation of that system.I love the concept, and have made some moderately complex attempts, e.g.,:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blockscad3d.com&#x2F;community&#x2F;projects&#x2F;1430644https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;WillAdams&#x2F;gcodepreviewit always devolves to screen size being out-paced by problem complexity --- one gets something of an inkling of this at:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scriptsofanotherdimension.tumblr.com&#x2F;Alternately, one can just break a project down into modules, but then the top-level view becomes the wall of text representation (albeit w&#x2F; nice lines or captured into pretty boxes) which one is ostensibly trying to escape.I&#x27;d love to see someone succeed in this, and I&#x27;ve been using:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;derkork&#x2F;openscad-graph-editorquite a bit, and put a bit of money towards:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nodezator.com&#x2F; reply Buttons840 19 hours agoparentprevI think the inherent suckiness with visual programming is...Imagine I was a consultant who offered to sit and watch over your shoulder and comment only on syntax issues.

As I said earlier - the main advantage is discoverability (plus a certain robustness against making errors which arise from the constraints).Discoverability is cancelled out by familiarity and if I&#x27;m going to use a tool seriously then I will become familiar with it.Every other aspect of visual programming is a disadvantage and in many cases a crippling one. The sheer laboriousness of constructing expressions, the lack of sophisticated refactoring and the amount of busywork tidying up nodes so they aren&#x27;t a jumble of spaghetti.I think these are solvable but not until there&#x27;s a way to avoid reinventing the wheel for every single system. reply dist-epoch 19 hours agoparentprevWe need a generic \"graph editor\" (let&#x27;s say VS Graph) and then use-case specific \"graph server protocols\" (Unreal Blueprint GSP).A graph editor is a large undertaking, having a few generic ones would avoid so much duplicate work.

    "originLink": "http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com/2023/09/50-years-later-is-two-phase-locking.html",
    "originBody": "Concurrency Freaks A web site dedicated to Concurrent algorithms and patterns. Friday, September 29, 2023 50 years later, is Two-Phase Locking the best we can do? Two phase locking (2PL) was the first of the general-purpose Concurrency Controls to be invented which provided Serializability. In fact, 2PL gives more than Serializability, it gives Opacity, a much stronger isolation level. 2PL was published in 1976, which incidentally is the year I was born, and it is likely that Jim Gray and his buddies had this idea long before it was published, which means 2PL first came to existence nearly 50 years ago. After all that time has passed, is this the best we can do? Turns out no, we can do better with 2PLSF, but let's start from the begining When I use the term \"general-purpose concurrency control\" I mean an algorithm which allows access multiple objects (or records or tuples, whatever you want to name them) with an all-or-nothing semantics. In other words, an algorithm that lets you do transactions over multiple data items. Two-Phase Locking has several advantages over the other concurrency controls that have since been invented, but in my view there are two important ones: simplicity and a strong isolation level. In 2PL, before accessing a record for read or write access, we must first take the lock that protects this record. During the transaction, we keep acquiring locks for each access, and only at the end of the transaction, when we know that no further accesses will be made, can we release all the locks. Having an instant in time (i.e. the end of the transaction) where all the locks are taken on the data that we accessed, means that there is a linearization point for our operation (transaction), which means we have a consistent view of the different records and can write to other records all in a consistent way. It doesn't get much simpler than this. Today, this idea may sound embarrassingly obvious, but 50 years ago many database researchers thought that it was ok to release the locks after completing the access to the record. And yes, it is possible to do so, but such a concurrency control is not serializable. As for strong isolation, database researchers continue to invent concurrency controls that are not serializable, and write papers about it, which means Serializability is not that important for Databases. On the other hand, all transactional commercial databases that I know of, use 2PL or some combination of it with T/O or MVCC. Moreover, in the field of concurrency data structures, linearizability is the gold standard, which means 2PL is used heavily. If we need to write to multiple nodes of a data structure in a consistent way, we typically need something like 2PL, at least for the write accesses. The exception to this are lock-free data-structures, but hey, that's why (correct) lock-free is hard! Ok, 2PL is easy to use and has strong isolation, so this means we're ready to go and don't need anything better than 2PL, right? I'm afraid not. 2PL has a couple of big disadvantages: poor read-scalability and live-lock progress. The classic 2PL was designed for mutual exclusion locks, which means that when two threads are performing a read-access on the same record, they will conflict and one of them (or both) will abort and restart. This problem can be solved by replacing the mutual exclusion locks with reader-writer locks, but it's not as simple as this. Mutual exclusion locks can be implemented with a single bit, representing the state of locked or unlocked. Reader-writer locks also need this bit and in addition, need to have a counter of the number of readers currently holding the lock in read mode. This counter needs enough bits to represent the number of readers. For example, 7 bits means you can have a maximum of 128 threads in the system, in case they all decide to acquire the read-lock on a particular reader-writer lock instance. For such a scenario this implies that each lock would take 1 byte, which may not sound like much, but if you have billions of records in your DB then you will need billions of bytes for those locks. Still reasonable, but now we get into the problem of contention on the counter. Certain workloads have lots of read accesses on the same data, they are read-non-disjoint. An example of this is the root node of a binary search tree, where all operations need to read the root before they start descending the nodes of the tree. When using 2PL, each of these accesses on the root node implies a lock acquisition and even if we're using read-writer locks, it implies heavy contention on the lock that protects the root node. Previous approaches have taken a stab at this problem, for example TLRW by Dave Dice and Nir Shavit in SPAA 2010. By using reader-writer locks they were able to have much better performance than using mutual exclusion locks, but still far from what the optimistic concurrency controls can achieve. Take the example of the plot below where we have an implementation similar to TLRW with each read-access contending on a single variable of the reader-writer lock, applied to a binary search tree, a Rank-based Relaxed AVL. Scalability is flat regardless of whether we're doing mostly write-transactions (left side plot) or just read-transactions (right side plot). Turns out it is possible to overcome this \"read-indicator contention\" problem through the usage of scalable read-indicators. Our favorite algorithm is a reader-writer lock where each reader announces its arrival/departure on a separate cache line, thus having no contention for read-lock acquisition. The downside is that the thread taking the write-lock must scan through all those cache lines to be able to ascertain whether if the write-lock is granted, thus incurring a higher cost for the write-lock acquisition. As far as I know, the first reader-writer lock algorithms with this technique were shown in the paper \"NUMA Aware reader-writer locks\" of which Dave Dice and Nir Shavit are two of the authors, along with Irina Calciu, Yossi Lev, Victor Luchangco, and Virenda Marathe This paper shows three different reader-writer lock algorithms, two with high scalability, but neither is starvation-free. So what we did was take some of these ideas to make a better reader-writer lock, which also scales well for read-lock acquisition but has other properties, and we used this to implement our own concurrency control which we called Two-Phase Locking Starvation-Free (2PLSF). The reader-writer locks in 2PLSF have one bit per thread reserved for the read-lock but they are located in their own cache line, along with the bits (read-indicators) of the next adjacent locks. Like on the \"NUMA-Aware reader-writer locks\" paper, the cost shifts to the write-lock acquisition which needs to scan multiple cache lines to acquire the write-lock. There is no magic here, just trade-offs, but this turns out to be a pretty good trade-off as most workloads tend to be on the read-heavy side. Even write-intensive workloads spend a good amount of time executing read-accesses, for example, during the record lookup phase. With our improved reader-writer lock the same benchmark shown previously for the binary search tree looks very different: With this improved reader-writer lock we are able to scale 2PL even on read-non-disjoint workloads, but it still leaves out the other major disadvantage, 2PL is prone to live-lock. There are several variants of the original 2PL, some of these variants aren't even serializable, therefore I wouldn't call them 2PL anymore and won't bother going into that. For the classical 2PL, there are three variants and they are mostly about how to deal with contention. They're usually named: - No-Wait - Wait-Or-Die - Deadlock-detection When a conflict is encountered, the No-Wait variant aborts the self transaction (or the other transaction) and retries again. This retry can be immediate, or it can be later, based on an exponential backoff scheme. The No-Wait approach has live-lock progress because two transactions with one attempting to modify record A and then record B, while the other is attempting to modify record B and then record A, may indefinitely conflict with each other and abort-restart without any of them ever being able to commit. The Deadlock-Detection variant keeps an internal list of threads waiting on a lock and detects cycles (deadlocks). This is problematic for reader-writer locks because it would require each reader to have its own list, which itself needs a (mutual exclusion) lock to protect it. And detecting the cycles would mean scanning all the readers' lists when the lock is taken in read-lock mode. Theoretically it should be possible to make this scheme starvation-free, but it would require using starvation-free locks, and as there is no (published) highly scalable reader-writer lock with starvation-free progress, it kind of defeats the purpose. Moreover, having one list per reader may have consequences on high memory usage. Who knows, maybe one day someone will try this approach. The Wait-Or-Die variant imposes an order on all transactions, typically with a timestamp of when the transaction started and, when a lock conflict arises, decides to wait for the lock or to abort, by comparing the timestamp of the transaction with the timestamp of the lock owner. This works fine for mutual exclusion locks as the owner can be stored in the lock itself using a unique-thread identifier, but if we want to do it for reader-writer locks then a thread-id would be needed per reader. If we want to support 256 threads then this means we need 8 bits x 256 = 256 bytes per reader-writer lock. Using 256 bytes per lock is a hard pill to swallow! But memory usage is not the real obstacle here. The Wait-Or-Die approach implies that all transactions have a unique transaction id so as to order them, for example, they can take a number from an atomic variable using a fetch_and_add() instruction. The problem with this is that on most modern CPUs you won't be able to do more than 40 million fetch_and_add() operations per second on a contended atomic variable. This may seem like a lot (Visa does about 660 million transactions per day, so doing 40 million per second sounds pretty good), but when it comes to in-memory DBMS it's not that much, and particularly for concurrent data structures is a bit on the low side. Even worse, this atomic fetch_and_add() must be done for all transactions, whether they are write-transactions or read-transactions. For example, in one of our machines it's not really possible to go above 20 M fetch_and_add() per second, which means that scalability suckz: To put this in perspective, one of my favorite concurrency controls is TL2 which was invented by (surprise!) none other than Dave Dice, Nir Shavit and Ori Shalev I hope by now you know who are the experts in this stuff ;) Anyways, in TL2 the read-transactions don't need to do an atomic fetch_and_add(), and they execute optimistic reads, which is faster than any read-lock acquisition you can think of. At least for read-transactions, TL2 can scale to hundreds of millions of transactions per second. By comparison, 2PL with Wait-Or-Die will never be able to go above 40 M tps/sec. This means if high scalability is your goal, then you would be better off with TL2 than 2PL… except, 2PLSF solves this problem too. In 2PLSF only the transactions that go into conflict need to be ordered, i.e. only these need to do a fetch_and_add() on a central atomic variable. This has two benefits: it means there is less contention on the central atomic variable that assigns the unique transaction id, and it means that transactions without conflicts are not bounded by the 40 M tps plateau. This means that we can have 200 M tps running without conflict and then 40 M tps that are having conflict, because the conflicting transactions are the only ones that need to do the fetch_and_add() and therefore, and the only ones bounded by the maximum number of fetch_and_adds() the CPU can execute per second. On top of this, the 2PLSF algorithm provides starvation-freedom. This post is already quite long so I'm not going to dive into the algorithm itself, but it's rather simple, as far as starvation-free algorithms can go. If you're interested, you can take a look at the paper: https://zenodo.org/record/7886718 or the source code: https://github.com/pramalhe/2PLSF/blob/main/stms/2PLSF.hpp Summary In this post we saw some of the advantages and disadvantages of 2PL and some of the variants of 2PL. We explained what it takes to scale 2PL: make a better reader-writer lock. But the big disadvantage of 2PL is the live-lock progress, which some variants could seemingly resolve, but in practice they don't because they will not scale, even with a better reader-writer lock. Then we described 2PLSF, a novel algorithm invented by me, Andreia and Pascal Felber to address these issues. In summary, 2PLSF is what 2PL should have been from the start, a concurrency control that scales well even when reads are non-disjoint and that provides starvation-free transactions, the highest form of blocking progress there is. Moreover, it's pretty good a solving certain kinds of conflicts, which means it can have scalability even some conflicts arise. 2PLSF is not perfect wrt but it's good enough, certainly much better than TL2. Despite being two-phase locking, it's as close to 2PL as a jackhammer is to a pickaxe. 2PLSF is not your grandfather's 2PL Posted by Pedro Ramalhete at 5:08 PM Email This BlogThis!

(concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com) 230 points by ingve 13 hours ago| hidepastfavorite57 comments samsquire 6 hours agoI&#x27;m a beginner in this topic and I find this topic interesting. I really want there to be an easy-to-deploy consistency solution.If I have a distributed microservice architecture and I want to keep multiple datastores in synchronization or \"consistent\" what&#x27;s the industry best practice?A few days ago I was trying to solve the inconsistency problem with \"settled timestamps\" which is a kind of multiversioning idea except that timestamps elapsed with the absence of reported error represent a valid save&#x2F;commit. Kind of like two phase commit with the second phase being time. The idea is that we watch the clocks of other servers and if they don&#x27;t update then we know we cannot trust their settled timestamps. (My intent was to allow scaling consistency across many servers, because we don&#x27;t need to wait for response for every update, we only need to wait for the next timestamp interval)Here&#x27;s my Multithreaded multiprocessing Python code to test indeterminancy. 10 threads all send eachother random updates. They also broadcast their own timestamp and the timestamps of their own perspective of the timestamps every other server.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;replit.com&#x2F;@Chronological&#x2F;InconsistencySimulation#ma... (click Run and watch the output, you&#x27;ll have to wait 10 seconds)A read in this simulation is the MIN of all timestamps of all servers reported timestamps.10 seconds into the simulation, we ask every thread for its own perspective of what the counter value is. Sometimes they will all report the same value, a lot of the time they shall be split brained.I am aware that wall clock timestamps are not suitable for ordering in a distributed system and that logical or vector clocks should be used for ordering.If you can get the simulation to all report the same number at any point in time, then that would be great :-)Ordering in distributed systems is significant, as the eventual consistency of the simulation means that some values can arrive late but affect the value, meaning it is not linearizable. Bloomlang tries to solve this.I&#x27;m specifically interested in scaling WITH consistency but I think this is quite difficult. reply rawgabbit 6 hours agoparentFor distributed systems, the main idea is a centralized write ordering journal that is replayed by individual nodes.Multiple systems write sequentially to the central journal. The journal is simply taking requests like a key value store. The journal is replicated to all the nodes. The nodes read from the journal and performs the complex logic requested. reply nine_k 5 hours agorootparentIf business software practices is not enough of a proof, look at any massive online games. They all use one central server as a source of truth about the game world, and broadcast that state to the clients. Anything a client reports that diverges from the central server view is either corrected, rejected, or becomes a reason to disconnect the client for cheating attempts.If you need strict order, that order should happen in strictly one place. (The universe itself does not support strict order at a distance, as Special Relativity shows.) reply bawolff 2 hours agorootparentBitcoin: Am I joke to you?Everyone: yes. reply rcxdude 1 hour agorootparentThere&#x27;s no performance gain from bitcoin&#x27;s approach though. The distributed consensus is there for trustless operation, not performance. It&#x27;s many orders of magnitude slower (and a few more orders of magnitude more power inefficient!) than just having one server handle it. reply sfifs 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t bitcoin actually eventual consensus determined by increasing unlikelihood of finding a conflicting sequence of hashes? reply rusk 2 hours agorootparentprevBitcoin is an interesting exception to the above. Issue is latency. reply mjan22640 2 hours agorootparentprevthat is server&#x2F;many clients, not distributed reply infogulch 3 hours agoparentprevI suspect TigerBeetle DB will be the industry benchmark for consistent, high throughput, fault tolerant, distributed databases in 5 years. reply theptip 1 hour agoparentprevLook at the Raft protocol. In general you’d rather not integrate at the protocol layer; it’s standard to use a consistent store like etcd that implements Raft for the coordination&#x2F;data that needs to be serializable.(Kubernetes uses etcd so it scales pretty well for a strongly-consistent k&#x2F;v store.)You said “multiple datastores” so I’m assuming you have heterogenous data and something like CockroachDB isn’t an option.> I&#x27;m a beginner in this topic and I find this topic interesting.Not trying to gatekeepe but rolling your own is dangerous. See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aphyr.com&#x2F; for the gold standard in testing (great educational material). You can use Jepsen to test your distributed systems. But better to just use datastores that Kyle has shown are solid. reply samsquire 1 hour agorootparentThanks for your reply.I&#x27;ve experimented with a toy Raft implementation but I haven&#x27;t Jepsen tested that and it&#x27;s incompleteI did write a Jepsen test for a different eventually consistent protocol which understandably fails the linearizability test because I&#x27;m still learning - eventually consistent is not linearizable.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;GitHub.com&#x2F;samsquire&#x2F;eventually-consistent-meshI want to have my cake and eat it too. Scalability and consistency. reply layer8 4 hours agoparentprevI’d suggest to re-evaluate if you really, really need (a) distributed data stores and (b) synchronous consistency. Things become much simpler if you can forego one of them. reply acuozzo 5 hours agoparentprevIs your inter-machine messaging asynchronous and is it possible for one of your machines to crash? reply eartheaterrr 8 hours agoprevI wonder how this new approach compares to serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;SSII&#x27;m not familiar with these technologies, but when I was studying databases, SSI was touted as the \"better\" 2PL on the horizon. I wonder how SSI compares to 2PLSF, and why it wasn&#x27;t mentioned here? reply 3cats-in-a-coat 7 hours agoparentI’m working on a memory model for a new platform which is almost entirely based around copy on write, snapshots and SSI. But in distributed effects you still need locks and two phase transactions and so on. These are largely complementary features imo. reply comex 9 hours agoprevFor Wait-Or-Die, do you really need to fetch_and_add to get a transaction ID? Do you need a transaction ID at all? It sounds like the goal is just to have an arbitrary-but-consistent ordering of active transactions so that different transactions can agree on who should wait and who should die in the event of a conflict. So why not just use the thread ID? Or even a random number might work (if ties are treated as “die”, so the worst that happens is that both transactions unnecessarily abort, and then retry with new random numbers).While it’s not mentioned, I suppose you want to prioritize older transactions in order to prevent long-running transactions from being starved by shorter-running transactions. (If one long transaction conflicts with an average of, say, three short transactions, and on each conflict it’s effectively random who wins, then each long transaction has only a 1&#x2F;8 chance of winning all three conflicts and being able to commit.)But preventing starvation only requires older transactions to be prioritized most of the time, not every single time, especially not if the transaction is only slightly older. So some kind of timestamp &#x2F; cycle counter should work fine, even if there’s skew between threads or other sources of inaccuracy. Ties could be broken by thread ID, or again by having both sides abort. reply djbusby 9 hours agoparentI would use a ULID rather than thread ID.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ulid&#x2F;specThey (and others) are great for this kind of case - and many others. reply codetrotter 9 hours agorootparentulid is great, I use it a lot.There is also a draft to make a new uuid variant – uuid v7 – that will be very similar to how ulid works.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;id&#x2F;draft-peabody-dispatch-new-u... reply techdragon 8 hours agorootparentI use ULID a lot too and It’s frustrating how close the new spec UUIDs are to it without actually being the same… so I’ve got a bunch of code to modify once Postgres supports generation of the new UUIDs server side without extensions or stored procedures. Relatively painless work, but frustrating since it could have been avoided. reply masklinn 3 hours agorootparent> frustrating since it could have been avoided.How? UUID is a structured format so the only options I can see is ulid creating their own unregistered uuid variant (probably a terrible idea) or adding ulid support to postgres (nothing to do with uuid). reply techdragon 3 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d love for Postgres to adopt ULID as a first class variant of the same basic 128bit wide binary optimized column type they use for UUIDs, but I don&#x27;t expect they will, while its \"popular\" its not likely popular enough to have support for them to maintain it in the long run... Also the smart money ahead of time would have been for the ULID spec to sacrifice a few data bits to leave the version specifying sections of the bit field layout unused in the ULID binary spec (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ulid&#x2F;spec#binary-layout-and-byte-order) for the sake of future compatibility with \"proper\" UUIDs... Performing one quick bitfield modification on every row in PostgreSQL would have been less painful as in set bit, vs load parse, repack in order to re-computing the appropriate UUIDv7s (or UUIDv8s for some reason) since the primary key update transaction should be roughly the same speed either way. reply djbusby 8 hours agorootparentprevYes. V7 looks good but ULID already does it. Rather than change code, I&#x27;m just staying with ULID. All give us 128 bits. That should be enough for anyone ;&#x2F; replytelez 5 hours agoprevI do not quite understand the last figure for the relaxed avl tree. For the 100 % lookup (rightmost) the TL2 algo should scale linearly with the number of threads. For read-only transactions, TL2 needs to sample the global version, then for all reads make sure the local version is less than or equal to the sampled version. given this, it is difficult to understand why the graph is sub linear and that TL2 is not as fast as the other STM implementations. reply colanderman 4 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t see such a graph for TL2? I do see one for TLRW though which does use reader locks, hence the scalability cap. reply telez 4 hours agorootparentthe chart doesn&#x27;t seem visible on ios safari but i can see it on firefox desktop however, the figure seems to be the same as from the linked paper: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenodo.org&#x2F;record&#x2F;7886718 reply colanderman 2 hours agorootparentAh ok I found it there, I see what you mean now. My only guess would be cache effects? With that large AVL tree (1 M entries, so likely dozens of MiB), you are escaping L2 cache and hitting shared L3 or main memory for a large portion of lookups, and are bandwidth-constrained at the die level, thus adding that knee (which I think is visible with some of the other algorithms as well). reply telez 45 minutes agorootparentbut TL2 shouldn&#x27;t be using more memory than say TinySTM, i don&#x27;t think. If the implementations are object based and nodes are cache aligned, adding an extra 8 bytes for the versioned-lock shouldn&#x27;t bump the node size to greater than a cache line.however, i do think the tl2 implementation as described in the paper is memory based, as is TinySTM so every read needs to do a hash to locate the corresponding lock &#x2F; meta data. the read-only transactions for tl2 and TinySTM seem identical to me which is why i am so confused.looking at other figures from the 2PLSF paper, the TL2 for 100% lookup on hash set and skip list it looks like such a dog compared to the other algos. replygigatexal 3 hours agoprev2PLSF paper the author claims is what 2PL should have been. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zenodo.org&#x2F;record&#x2F;7886718 reply vlovich123 7 hours agoprevInteresting re the transaction ID generation. Sled generates ~70-120 million transaction IDs per second. The author points out that it’s still a scaling bottleneck but I wonder if Sled’s approach might raise the TPS for the contended case. reply klabb3 8 hours agoprevOne thing I didn’t quite catch was: I thought most write transactions needs consistent reads on many (contended) “objects”, but the actual writes are often just one or two objects. Is 2PL addressing this or does a write transaction take write locks on all objects? reply rawgabbit 8 hours agoparentYou can take locks on all objects before you write. Most systems don’t do that.Usually there are multiple writes to complete a business process. In each step stale data is read to create a write request similar to how you place your order with the wait staff at the restaurant. The wait staff will orchestrate your request. First the chef prepares your meal according to the order ticket. Second the wait staff delivers your meal based on the chef’s internal work order. Lastly they take your payment based on the original order ticket. Notice there are at least three microtransactions based on stale data. No one is holding locks until the diner finishes eating. reply zaphirplane 5 hours agorootparentIIUC, That’s a micro service way, missing cancellations and rollback and timeoutsWhat happens if the chef can’t fulfill the meal, the customer leaves cause the order is taking long … etc Most real life will not charge the customer is the chef can’t make the meal and cancel the cooking if the customer leavesThe analogy maybe going far ;) reply johnthescott 8 hours agoprevhuh? no mention of serializable snapshot isolation (SSI), used by most commercial dbs for years. what gives? reply indus 7 hours agoprevIsn’t 2PL a limited applicability construct?All my incoming and outgoing “transactions” are over loosely-coupled API calls.Is there a point I’m missing? reply grivant 7 hours agoparentIMO it’s about what’s happening underneath those API calls. You might be doing lots of POST requests that touch the same underlying sql table. reply mgaunard 11 hours agoprevMVCC is what most databases do. reply vore 10 hours agoparentMVCC is optimistic concurrency control – you may end up having to retry your write transaction multiple times, which might suck if the transaction is expensive. Pessimistic concurrency control like locking may be cheaper in those cases, since the cost of locking may be drastically lower. Having one doesn&#x27;t preclude the other! reply endisneigh 9 hours agoparentprevhas its own tradeoffs tho reply convolvatron 11 hours agoprevthis is a great paper that provides a framework for comparing 2 phase and paxos.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lamport.azurewebsites.net&#x2F;video&#x2F;consensus-on-transac... reply thoughtlede 11 hours agoparentTwo-phase locking is different from two-phase commit, in spite of an overlap in their naming. Two-phase commit is relevant to be compared against Paxos - both of which fall under the category of consensus protocols.Two-phase locking is a concurrency control mechanism. reply roncesvalles 11 hours agorootparentA little summary:2PC: An algorithm used in the context of distributed transactions where each machine handles a different part of the transaction. This means that nothing is redundant - the success of each and every participant is required for the transaction to be committed.Paxos&#x2F;Raft&#x2F;consensus: An algorithm usually used in the context of distributed replication. Since every participant is doing the same thing, it&#x27;s tolerable if a few fail or give outputs that diverge from the majority.2PL: A method of acquiring multiple locks such that first you acquire all the required locks (first phase), then you do what you need to do, and then you release all the locks (second phase). This is in contrast to a locking scheme where lock acquisitions and releases are interspersed. This isn&#x27;t strictly limited to distributed systems, although it&#x27;s common to see 2PC with 2PL.If this piques your interest, read the Spanner paper! Spanner uses all three - 2PC with 2PL for distributed read-write transactions, and Paxos for replication.PS: \"Distributed\" just means there&#x27;s more than one machine involved, any of which may fail independently, and communication among these machines happens over unreliable wire. reply thoughtlede 10 hours agorootparentIn a multi-replica system, where, say, we cannot tolerate any failures or lags, is 2PC used in practice to achieve consensus? Or are there other methods for achieving such strict consensus? reply mjb 7 hours agorootparent2PC (or atomic commitment more generally) is needed for sharded&#x2F;partitioned systems with different data on each node. In these systems, each node gets a vote on whether a transaction should be allowed to commit. Replication, making multiple copies of the same data, doesn&#x27;t need 2PC. Instead, algorithms like Paxos, Raft, or chain replication are used. reply foota 9 hours agorootparentprevThere are other means, the most common being Calvin like protocols where every replica deterministically processes some log, and so only one round of distributed calls is necessary. reply reubenbond 9 hours agorootparentWhich systems use Calvin-like protocols? reply foota 4 hours agorootparentFaunaDB is the most popular, I believe. reply westurner 7 hours agorootparentprevConcurrency control > Concurrency control in databases > Why is concurrency control needed?: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Concurrency_control#Why_is_c...?Locks (computer science) > Disadvantages: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Lock_(computer_science)#Disadv...Two-phase locking (2PL) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Two-phase_lockingTwo-phase commit protocol (2PC) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Two-phase_commit_protocolPaxos: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Paxos_(computer_science)Raft: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Raft_(algorithm)Consensus (computer science) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Consensus_(computer_science)Spanner: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Spanner_(database)Non-blocking algorithm; \"lock-free concurrency\", \"wait-free\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-blocking_algorithm\"Why don&#x27;t PCs have better entropy sources?\" [for generating txids&#x2F;uuids] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30877296\"100-Gbit&#x2F;s Integrated Quantum Random Number Generator Based on Vacuum Fluctuations\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.aps.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PRXQuantum.4.010330Re: tests of randomness: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mail.python.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;list&#x2F;python-ideas@python.or...TIL there&#x27;s a regular heartbeat in the quantum foam; there&#x27;s a regular monotonic heartbeat in the quantum Rydberg wave packet interference; and that should be useful for distributed applications with and without vector clocks and an initial time synchronization service (WhiteRabbit > PTP > NTP Network Time Protocol) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.aps.org&#x2F;prresearch&#x2F;abstract&#x2F;10.1103&#x2F;PhysRev... :> The [quantum time-keeping application of this research] relies on the unique fingerprint that is created by the time-dependent photoionization of these complex wave packets.

    "originBody": "Erin Kissane home archives search feed about Meta in Myanmar, Part I: The Setup “Technology is like a bomb in Myanmar.” —Kyaw Kyaw, frontman of Burmese punk band Rebel Riot 1 Back in early July, I started working on a quick series of posts about online structures of refuge and exposure. In a draft of what I meant to be the second post in the series, I tried to write a tight two or three paragraphs about the role Meta played in the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar, and why it made me dubious about Threads. Over time, those two or three paragraphs turned into a long summary, then a detailed timeline, then an unholy hybrid of blog post and research paper. What I learned in the process was so starkly awful that I finally set the whole series aside for a while until I could do a lot more reading and write something more substantial. Nearly three months later, I’m ready to share my notes. Here’s a necessary personal disclosure: I’ve never trusted Facebook, mostly because I’ve been around tech for a long time and everything I’ve ever learned about the company looked like a red flag. Like, I’m on the record swearing about it. But once I started to really dig in, what I learned was so much gnarlier and grosser and more devastating than what I’d assumed. The harms Meta passively and actively fueled destroyed or ended hundreds of thousands of lives that might have been yours or mine, but for accidents of birth. I say “hundreds of thousands” because “millions” sounds unbelievable, but by the end of my research I came to believe that the actual number is very, very large. To make sense of it, I had to try to go back, reset my assumptions, and try build up a detailed, factual understanding of what happened in this one tiny slice of the world’s experience with Meta. The risks and harms in Myanmar—and their connection to Meta’s platform—are meticulously documented. And if you’re willing to spend time in the documents, it’s not that hard to piece together what happened. I started down this path—in this series, on this site, over this whole year—because I want to help make better technologies and systems in service of a better world. And I think the only way to make better things is to thoroughly understand what’s happened so far. Put another way, I want to base decisions on transparently sourced facts and cautiously reasoned analysis, not on assumptions or vibes—mine or anyone else’s. What I want to promise you, my imaginary reader, is that I’ve approached this with as much care and precision as I can. I cite a lot of documentation from humanitarian organizations and many well-sourced media reports, and also a bunch of internal Meta documentation. What I’m after is maybe something like a cultural-technical incident report. I hope it helps. This is the first of four posts in the series. Thank you for reading. I’ve put notes about terms (Meta vs. Facebook, Myanmar vs. Burma, etc.) and sources and warnings in a separate meta-post. If you’re someone who likes to know about that kind of thing, you might want to pop that post open in a tab. If you spot typos or inaccuracies, I’m reachable at erin at incisive.nu and appreciate all bug reports. Content warning: I’m marking some sections and some cited sources with individual warnings, but this is a story with a genocide at its heart, so be aware of that going in. I’ve also included a small selection of hateful messages in this post and throughout the series so that it’s clear what we’re talking about when we talk about “hate speech.” Some contain words that, used in specific contexts, constitute slurs. I put some notes about all of that in the meta post as well. This is a story about tech Even if you never read any further, know this: Facebook played what the lead investigator on the UN Human Rights Council’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (hereafter just “the UN Mission”) called a “determining role” in the bloody emergence of what would become the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.2 From far away, I think Meta’s role in the Rohingya crisis can feel blurry and debatable—it was content moderation fuckups, right? In a country they weren’t paying much attention to? Unethical and probably negligent, but come on, what tech company isn’t, at some point? Plus, Meta has popped up in the press and before Congress to admit that they fucked up and have concrete plans to do better. They lost sleep over it, said Adam Mosseri, the person in charge of Facebook’s News Feed, back in March of 2018. By that point in 2018, Myanmar’s military had murdered thousands of Rohingya people, including babies and children, and beaten, raped, tortured, starved, and imprisoned thousands more. About three-quarters of a million Rohingya had fled Myanmar to live in huge, disease-infested refugee camps in Bangladesh. And Meta? By that point, Meta had been receiving detailed and increasingly desperate warnings about Facebook’s role as an accelerant of genocidal propaganda in Myanmar for six years. My big hope for the internet is that we handle the shit we need to handle to make sturdier, less poisoned/poisonous ways to connect and collaborate in the gnarly-looking decades ahead. I think that’s not just possible, but that it’s our responsibility to work toward it. Also, I’m pretty sure that despite the best intentions and the most transparent processes, we risk doing enormous harm if we don’t learn from the past. (Maybe even if we do.) This series is for anyone who, like me—and despite everything not good about the tech world—has found themselves periodically heartened and sustained by open technology projects, online communities, and ways of being together even when we’re far apart. And the thing I want you, and all of us, to remember about the sudden flowering of the internet in Myanmar in the 2010s is that in the beginning, it was incredibly welcome and so filled with hope. Welcome to the internet After decades of crushing state repression, a more democratic regime came into power in Myanmar in 2011 and gradually relaxed restrictions on the internet, and on speech more generally. Journalist and tech researcher Faine Greenwood (they/them) is working in Southeast Asia at the time, and gets caught up in the spirit of the moment, despite their skepticism about the benefits of the internet: I’d connected with a Myanmar NGO dedicated to digital inclusion, and through them, I got a chance to meet and interview a number of brilliant and extremely online Burmese people, all of them brimming with long-suppressed, almost giddy, optimism about their country’s technological future. It was hard for me not to share their enthusiasm, their massive relief at finally getting out from under the jackboot of a military regime that had tried to lock them away from the rest of their world for as long as they could remember. I came away from speaking with them with a warm, happy feeling about how online communication maybe, just maybe, really did have the power to unfuck the world.3 And online communication was coming in fast, as the price of SIM cards, which had been controlled by the ruling junta, dropped from the equivalent of $2,000 USD in 2009, to $250 in 2012, to $1.50 in 2014.4 Mobile adoption explodes, from less than one quarter of a percent of the population in 2011 to more than 90% in 2017.5 And smartphone use and internet uptake spikes with the mobile revolution instead of dragging along behind—a 2017 Bloomberg article does some flavor reporting to contextualize those numbers: Thiri Thant Mon, owner of a small investment bank in the city, says she still remembers how magazines from the outside world used to arrive weeks late because censors needed time to comb through them. “Suddenly because we’re on internet,” she said, “people realize what the rest of the world looks like. Now it’s like everybody on the street is talking about Trump. A few years ago, nobody knew what was happening in the next town.”6 In 2015, writer and photographer Craig Mod is working with a team doing internet ethnography in rural Myanmar on behalf of an organization that designs and builds hardware—including modern farming implements—to improve the lives of farmers, who make up the majority of Myanmar’s populace. (Disclosure: Craig and I have halfass-known each other for going on a couple of decades, and I’m a longtime fan of his work.) Mod’s essay about his work is clearly the product of a sensitive eye and a nerd’s delight in the way new technology twines up with the unevenly distributed realities of daily life: The village still lacks electricity although they’ve pooled funds and a dozen newly planted metal-power poles dot the fields, waiting to be wired up. Through our interpreter I ask, Where do you charge? Farmer Number Ten points to a car battery hanging in the corner onto which familiar USB wires are spliced. The tech is all over the place, “cheap but capable,” and Craig wonders if the one-smartphone-per-human result would make Nicholas Negroponte happy. There are no iPhones, no credit cards, no data plans: “Everyone buys top-up from top-up shops, scratches off complex serial numbers printed in a small font, types them with special network codes into their phone dialers in a way that feels steampunkish, like they’re divining data. They feel each megabyte.”7 This is the point in the conversation when it becomes impossible not to talk about Facebook. Because in Myanmar, even back in 2012 and 2013, being online meant being on Facebook. I’d read about Facebook’s superdominance in Amnesty International’s reporting, in long stories from Reuters and Wired and the NYT and the Guardian, in books, even in UN reports. But Mod’s notes bring to life both Facebook’s pervasiveness and the way Burmese people actually used it: We ask about apps. The farmer uses [chat app] Viber and Facebook. He says he chats with a few friends on Facebook but mainly people he doesn’t know. Most of his Facebook friends are strangers. He tells us his brother installed the app for him, and set up his account. He doesn’t know the email address that was used. He gets most of his news from Facebook. The election looms and he loves the political updates. Farmer Number Ten tells us he used to use radio for news but no more. He says he hasn’t turned the radio on in years. Other news apps—like one called TZ—use too much data. He’s data conscious. He uses Facebook mostly at night when the internet is fastest, and cheapest. And speaking with the proprietor of a cellphone shop: Facebook is the most popular app, he says. Nine out of ten people who come into the shop want Facebook. Ten months ago SIM prices dropped, data prices dropped, interest in Facebook jumped. I take note. Only half the people who come into the shop already have a Facebook account. The other half don’t know how to make one. I do that for them, he says. I am the account maker. And what about other apps? He mentions a news app called TZ. Once popular, now less so. He brushes his hand aside and says it’s too data hungry. Everyone is data sensitive he says and reiterates: Facebook. Nobody needs a special app for their interests. Just search for your interest on Facebook. Facebook is the Internet.8 But how did Facebook get to be the internet? In the early years, there’s a stripped-down version of the app kicking around that used less data than competitors’. But also, when Myanmar’s government opens up to two foreign telecom services, the stronger of the two, Norway’s Telenor, “zero-rates” Facebook.9 Essentially, zero-rating is a selective subsidy; it means that customers won’t be charged for the data they use for some parts of the internet, but not others. For all of Telenor’s customers, using Facebook is free. I want to briefly flip ahead to something Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen says in a 2021 interview: Facebook bought the privilege of being the internet for the majority of languages in the world. It subsidized people’s use of its own platform, and said “Hey, you can use anything you want, but you’ll have to pay for that—or you can use our platform for free.” As a result, for the majority of languages in the world, 80 or 90% of all the content in that exists in those languages is on Facebook.10 That this explosion of connectivity presented dangers as well as freedoms is immediately clear to civil society orgs in Myanmar, for two main reasons: The first is the state of comparative innocence with which the vast majority of Burmese people approach the internet. The second is that the political situation in Myanmar is a powderkeg at best. There’s a third thing, though most people don’t know it yet, which is that Meta’s decision-making about Myanmar reflects no willingness to adjust for the first two. To get to that, we need to start at the beginning. The blogger and the monk A tiny canned history of modern Myanmar might go like this: In a series of East-India-Company–entangled conflicts, the British Empire took control of Myanmar, then called Burma. From the beginning of the wars in 1824 to 1948, Britain ruled Burma, with a big rupture during WWII when Japan invaded Burma. Thant U-Mynt’s The River of Lost Footsteps: Histories of Burma (FSG, 2006) is a very readable history of Myanmar. After the war, the Burmese government the British left behind was too weak to withstand the combination of vigorous civil conflict with ethnic minorities on the frontiers and a 1962 coup by military leaders. Beginning in 1962, Burma—renamed Myanmar in English by the ruling junta, but the two names come from the same root—is under incredibly tight military rule. Beginning in 2011, the junta relaxes their grip, and Myanmar begins a precarious transition to a more democratic form of government. Note: All through this entire period, Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, is also waging a 70-year civil war with armed insurgencies associated with several different ethnic minorities. Starting the year after Myanmar’s first quasi-democratic general election in 2010, the Burmese government begins granting mass amnesties to the country’s many political prisoners. Hundreds of people—journalists, activists, artists, religious leaders, and many more—are released over the next few years. In the mass amnesty granted in January of 2012, two of the many prisoners released will go on to found organizations that play major and opposing roles in escalating crises of communal and military violence that Myanmar’s entry to the internet will fuel. One is Nay Phone Latt, an early blogger and digital rights activist, who was jailed in 2008, basically for blogging about the 2007 Saffron Revolution demonstrations. Nay Phone Latt will go on to co-found MIDO, an organization dedicated to helping Myanmar’s ordinary citizens reap the benefits of the newly available internet. Over the next several years, MIDO will come up repeatedly in the intense struggle against online hate campaigns, especially on Facebook.11 The second is Ashin Wirathu, a Buddhist monk jailed in 2003 for sermons inciting violence against Myanmar’s Muslim communities.12 Wirathu will go on to digitize Myanmar’s hardline extremist Buddhist movement, which will play a major role in the coming waves of anti-Muslim violence—also especially on Facebook. In 2013, Faine Greenwood goes back to Myanmar to write about the country’s first Internet Freedom Forum, “a gathering dedicated to helping Myanmar’s people take advantage of the new, liberated Internet.” Faine writes about the heady vibes: Nay Phone Latt spoke at the conference, and so did a number of the other brilliant young Burmese tech enthusiasts I’d met before. The mood was still buoyantly optimistic as we circulated from one Post-It note-filled brainstorming session to the next, as we drank tea, discussed Internet freedom regulations and online privacy. And yet, I could detect a slight edge in the air, a certain trepidation that had grown, mutated into new forms, in the few months since I’d been away […] During the conference, we talked about how hateful talk about the Rohingya was starting to pop up on Facebook, about how it was casting an ominous shadow over the good things about helping more people get online.13 The edge in the air and the ominous shadow aren’t just vague feelings—they’re connected to a surge in communal violence the same year of that critical mass amnesty, and to a parallel rise in online hate speech. MIDO co-founder and program director Htaike Htaike Aung spoke on the online dynamics she and her colleagues encountered in the early days: Unlike in countries where people gradually got used to the Internet and learnt how to find good content, thus learning what is bad content, for Myanmar this hype went straight up and people did not have the time to reflect on what the Internet is actually about. This perception can be summarized in the phrase: “Okay, if it’s on the Internet it must be right”. This really is dangerous, particularly if there are people who are using the Internet for the wrong agenda and propaganda.14 In 2014, Nay Phone Latt explains what he’s seeing and why he’s worried about it: When we advocate for free speech, reducing hate speech is included.… Speech calling for hitting or killing someone is hate speech, and can spread hate among people and is a risk for society… It is the wrong use of freedom of speech. I am worried about that because it is not only spreading on social media but also by some writers and [Buddhist] monks who are spreading hate speech publicly. […] If people hate each other, a place will not be safe to live. I worry about that most for our society. In some places, although they are not fighting, hate exists within their heart because they have poured poison into their heart for a long time [through hate speech]. It can explode in anytime.15 So what were Htaike Htaike Aung and Nay Phone Latt and their colleagues seeing that made them so worried? Here are some Facebook comments from all the way back in 2011, sparked by the BBC’s audacity in…referring to Rohingya people as a ethnic group that exists in Myanmar at all. The BBC’s offending infographic had been up for a year before the BBC’s Burmese Facebook page was flooded with comments: Kick out all Muslim Kalar [Rohingyas, South Asians/Indians] from Burma. If this doesn’t work, then kill them to death. It’s time for Arakan to unite with each other. Don’t assume that I won’t sharpen my knife. I am ready to make it sharp for the sake of protecting our nation, religion and races against those Bengali cheaters. F@#$-ing Kalar, we will slap your face with shoes and cut your heads. Don’t criticize the god with little of what you know. We will set you on fire to death and turn the mosques into wholesales/retail pork markets…16 “Kalar,” when used to refer to Rohingya people and other Muslims in Myanmar, is a slur with implications of ugliness, dark skin, and/or foreign ancestry. The New Mandala article about the controversy includes memes mocking BBC journalist Anna Jones using vintage 4chan trollface visuals, if that helps situate things for you. So this is the landscape already in place before Nay Phone Latt was released from prison in 2012. And things don’t get any better as Facebook/internet adoption spikes. We know now that behind the scenes, Burmese activists and organizations—and concerned westerners—spent this period desperately trying to get Facebook to act on the rapidly rising surge of anti-Rohingya hate speech. But neither those efforts nor public educational/digital literacy campaigns can keep up with what’s happening online. The Rohingya I need to make a brief detour, about the Rohingya. Here’s Médicins Sans Frontières, from their reference page about the Rohingya refugee crisis: The Rohingya are a stateless ethnic group, the majority of whom are Muslim, who have lived for centuries in the majority Buddhist Myanmar, mostly in the country’s north, in Rakhine state. However, Myanmar authorities contest this; they claim the Rohingya are Bengali immigrants who came to Myanmar in the 20th century. Described by the United Nations in 2013 as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world, the Rohingya are denied citizenship under Myanmar law. 17 I’ve relied heavily on Carlos Sardiña Galache’s The Burmese Labyrinth (Verso, 2020) and Thant Myint-U’s The Hidden History of Burma (WW Norton, 2019) to build out my own understanding of the Rohingya crisis and the history leading up to it, and I highly recommend both books. It’s hard to overstate how contested those basic facts are within Myanmar itself, where successive governments have rejected any recognition of Rohingya existence, let along legitimacy, referring to them instead as illegal “Bengali” immigrants.18 (The Rohingya Culture Center in Chicago has published a concise timeline of Rohingya history, and it makes a good, quick orientation.19) Going deeper, things get immediately, bogglingly complicated. My background is inadequate to the task of explaining the entangled ethnic, religious, and political histories of Myanmar in even just Rakhine (formerly Arakan) State, where the Rohingya crisis takes place. What you need to know to understand this series is mostly just that Rohingya people do in fact exist and have long lived under crushing restrictions. Also that Myanmar’s Buddhist political mainstream has long been concerned with racial purity and security. And openly so: the official motto of the Ministry of Immigration and Population is: “The earth will not swallow a race to extinction but another race will.”20 The rumors and the killings (2012) In this section, I draw heavily from the findings of the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar. I want to put a caution here in the main text that the findings document is an analysis of atrocities, so heads up, it’s very rough reading. Content warning: Violence against men, women, and children. On the 28th of May, 2012, a Buddhist Rakhine woman called Ma Thida Htwe is killed in a village in Rakhine State. The next day, a newspaper reports that she was raped and murdered by “kalars” and calls the killing “the worst homicide case in Myanmar.” Almost immediately, graphic photos of her body begin circulating online. 21 The findings of UN Mission note that although Ma Thida Htwe was clearly murdered, both the rape allegation and ethnic origin of the suspected culprits remain in doubt, and that, “In the following days and weeks, it was mainly the rape allegation, more than the murder, which was used to incite violence and hatred against the Rohingya.”22 For the people who’ve been working to whip up anti-Rohingya hatred and violence, the crime against Ma Thida Htwe is a perfect opportunity—and they use it, immediately, to suggest that it’s merely the leading edge of a coming wave of attacks by Rohingya terrorists. Four days after Ma Thida Htwe’s death, on June 1st, Zaw Htay, the spokesman of the President of Myanmar, posts a statement on Facebook warning that “Rohingya terrorists” are “crossing the border into Myanmar with weapons.” He goes on: We don’t want to hear any humanitarian or human rights excuses. We don’t want to hear your moral superiority, or so-called peace and loving kindness.… Our ethnic people are in constant fear in their own land. I feel very bitter about this. This is our country. This is our land.23 On June 3rd, five days after the Rakhine woman’s murder, a nationalist Buddhist group hands out leaflets in a village in southern Rakhine State stating that Muslims are assaulting Buddhist women. A bus carrying ten Rohingya men attempts to pass through the village that same day, and the villagers haul the men out, beat them to death, and destroy the bus. A few days later, Rohingya people in a nearby town riot, killing Buddhist villagers and burning homes. 24 The information landscape in Myanmar is so unstable that accounts of any given incident conflict, often in major ways. Sai Latt’s post I link to refers to nine Rohingya men and a woman—other accounts refer to ten Muslim men and one Buddhist killed by mistake. I’m using the UN Mission’s carefully investigated accounts as the closest thing to ground truths, but few details—especially in media accounts—should be taken as absolute facts. In an article published on the academic regional analysis site New Mandala only seven days after the Rohingya men are killed in Rakhine State, Burmese PhD candidate Sai Latt writes: What actually triggered public anger? It may have been racial profiling by the ethnic Arakan news agency, Narinjara… When the rape incident took place, the agency published news identifying the accused with their Islamic faith. In its Burmese language news, the incident was presented as if Muslims [read aliens] were threatening local people, and now they have raped and brutally killed a woman. The words—Muslims, Kalar, Islam—were repeatedly used in its news reports. The news spread and people started talking about it in terms of Kalar and “Lu Myo Char [i.e. different race/people or alien] insulting our woman”. Interestingly, Naranjara and Facebook users started talking about the accused rapists as Kalars even when the backgrounds of the accused were still unclear.25 In the wave of military and communal violence that follows, members of both Rakhine (the dominant Buddhist ethnicity in Rakhine State) and Rohingya communities commit murder and arson, but the brunt of the attacks falls on the Rohingya. The UN Mission’s findings describe house-burning, looting, “extrajudicial and indiscriminate killings, including of women, children and elderly people,” and the “mass arbitrary arrests” and torture of Rohingya people by soldiers and police. More than 100,000 people, most of them Rohinyga, are forced from their homes. 26 The next wave of violence comes in October and shows evidence of coordinated planning. According to Human Rights Watch, the fall attacks were “organized, incited, and committed by local Arakanese political party operatives, the Buddhist monkhood, and ordinary Arakanese, at times directly supported by state security forces.” The attacks included mass killings of Rohingya men, women, and children, whose villages and homes were burned to the ground, sometimes in simultaneous attacks across geographically distant communities. In the worst attack that October, police and soldiers in Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, preemptively confiscate sticks and other rudimentary weapons from Rohingya villagers, then stand by and watch while a Rakhine mob murders at least 70 Rohingya people over the course of a single day. Human Rights Watch reports that 28 children are hacked to death in the attack, including 13 children under the age of 5.27 Every spark is more likely to turn into a fire According to many of Amnesty International’s interviews with Rohingya refugees, the 2012 episodes of communal violence mark the turning point of Myanmar’s slide into intense anti-Rohingya rhetoric, persecution, and, ultimately, genocide. Mohamed Ayas, a Rohingya schoolteacher and refugee, puts it this way: We used to live together peacefully alongside the other ethnic groups in Myanmar. Their intentions were good to the Rohingya, but the government was against us. The public used to follow their religious leaders, so when the religious leaders and government started spreading hate speech on Facebook, the minds of the people changed.28 In a short 2013 documentary, journalist and filmmaker Aela Callan interviews Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based political analyst with decades of experience in the country and (now, at least) advisor to The International Crisis Group. Horsey’s take on the situation in Myanmar accords with the Amnesty interviews: We’ve seen violence in previous decades by Buddhist populations against Muslim populations, but what’s new is that this information is readily available and transmissible. People are using Facebook and mobile phones, and so you get a much greater resonation every time there’s an issue. Every time there’s a spark, it’s much more likely to turn into a fire.29 In the months between the June and October waves of violence in Myanmar, dehumanizing and violence-inciting anti-Rohingya messages continue to circulate on Burmese-language Facebook. Western observers who fly in to conduct investigations emphasize town-hall meetings and pamphlets spreading hateful and violent rhetoric, but—while noting that it was also surging online—write off the internet as a major influence on the events because internet access remains unusual in rural Rakhine State.30 The very early and very strong concerns of Burmese observers and activists I’ve cited above—Htaike Htaike Aung, Nay Phone Latt, and Sai Latt—about hate speech on Facebook specifically suggest to me that it’s possible that western observers may have underestimated the role of secondhand transmission of internet-circulated ideas, including printed copies of internet propaganda, which are cited as a vector in an interview with another MIDO co-founder, Phyu Phyu Thi. (This exact dynamic—the printed internet—shows up in Sheera Frenkel’s 2016 BuzzFeed News article, which cites “print magazines called Facebook and The Internet.”)31 In any case, online and off, hardline Buddhist monks, members of the government, and what appear to be ordinary people are all echoing a few distinct ideas: They claim that the Rohingya are not a real ethnic group, but illegal “Bengali” immigrants; subhuman animals who “outbreed” Buddhists; indistinguishable from terrorists; an immediate danger to the sexual purity and safety of Buddhist women and to Buddhist Myanmar as a whole. 32 Sai Latt also cites a Facebook account for exiled Burmese film director Cho Tu Zal with 5,000 friends and more than 2,000 subscribers as a major source of anti-Rohingya propaganda—this is in fact the same guy who coordinated the Facebook campaign against the BBC in 2011. Sai Latt writes in June 2012 that the anti-Rohingya hate campaign is “a public and transnational movement orchestrated openly on social media websites,” which includes thousands of people from the Burmese diaspora: The campaign is so severe that such comments and postings have been littered on thousands of Facebook walls and pages. Thousands of Burmese-speaking Facebook users are exposed to them every single day. Many Facebook groups such as “Kalar Beheading Gang” appeared one after another. While it is possible to report abuse to Facebook, there were few Burmese Muslim Facebook users who would report to Facebook. Even when they did successfully, new groups keep appearing frequently. That Facebook Page, “Kalar Beheading Gang,” shows up in the international press as well. It features “an illustration of a grim reaper with an Islamic symbol on its robe on a blood-spattered background,” and a stream of graphic photos presented as evidence of Rohingya atrocities. By the time the Hindustan Times article goes to press on June 14, 2012, the Page already has more than 500 likes.33 When Sai Latt says that what he’s seeing on Facebook is an orchestrated movement, he’s right. Remember Wirathu, the Buddhist monk released in the same amnesty as MIDO’s Nay Phone Latt? Soon after his release from prison, he’s one of the people doing the orchestrating. “A faster way to spread the messages” “We are being raped in every town, being sexually harassed in every town, being ganged up on and bullied in every town.… In every town, there is a crude and savage Muslim majority.” —Wirathu, 2013 34 Ashin Wirathu is very, very good at Facebook. He spoke with BuzzFeed News about his history on the platform: [Wirathu’s] first account was small, he said, and almost immediately deleted by Facebook moderators who wrote that it violated their community standards. The second had 5,000 friends and grew so quickly he could no longer accept new requests. So he started a new page and hired two full-time employees who now update the site hourly. “I have a Facebook account with 190,000 followers and a news Facebook page. The internet and Facebook are very useful and important to spread my messages,” he said. On the dozens of Facebook pages he runs out of a dedicated office, Wirathu has called for the boycott of Muslim businesses, and for Muslims to be expelled from Myanmar.35 In a 2013 video interview with the Global Post, Wirathu speaks placidly about the possibility of interfaith problem-solving and multi-ethnic peace—and then, with no transition or change of tone, about Muslims “devouring the Burmese people, destroying Buddhist and Buddhist order, forcefully taking action to establish Myanmar as an Islamic country, and forcefully implementing them.” To these absolute fantasies—Muslims make up maybe five percent of Myanmar’s population at this time—Wirathu adds that, “Muslims are like the African carp. They breed quickly and they are very violent and they eat their own kind.”36 International perception matters to Myanmar’s Buddhist establishment. In Callan’s documentary, you can see protesting monks carrying a printed banner denouncing Hannah Beech, with her photograph crossed out. In 2013, Time puts Wirathu on the cover of its international editions as “The Face of Buddhist Terror.” Time reporter Hannah Beech quotes him in the cover story explaining that 90% of Muslims in Myanmar are “radical bad people,” and that Barack Obama is “tainted by black Muslim blood.“ 37 Photo by Adam Dean/Panos It would be hard to overstate Wirathu’s influence in Myanmar during the years leading up to the beginning of the Rohingya genocide. One NGO writes that, “It is noteworthy that almost every major outbreak of communal violence since October 2012 in Rakhine state has been preceded by a 969-sponsored preaching tour in the area, usually by [Wirathu] himself.”38 In fact, the same thing is true of the 2012 violence, though from a little further away: Wirathu led a rally in Mandalay in September of 2012 in support of a proposal by then-President Thein Sein to deport the Rohingya en masse. The worst of the violence in Rakhine State took place the very next month.39 I think it’s useful to note that the 969/Ma Bha Tha movement Wirathu is associated with is also a force for practical and immediate good among Myanmar’s Buddhist majority—they run or support lots of Buddhist religious education for children, legal aid, donation drives, and relief campaigns. And these things, along with the high esteem in which monks are generally held in Myanmar, makes them seem exceptionally credible.40 Wirathu himself is beloved not only for his incendiary sermons that “defend” Buddhism by demonizing Muslims, but also for his direct involvement in community support. If the project of supporting and defending Buddhism is extended to eliminating the Rohingya, maybe those two kinds of action blur. In Callan’s documentary, Wirathu holds office hours to help ordinary community members solve problems and disputes. His attention flicks constantly between the petitioners kneeling in front of him and the smartphone cradled in his hand. A few years later, Wirathu—by then running a Facebook empire with nearly 200,000 followers, dozens of Pages, and a full-time staff—sums up the situation: “If the internet had not come to [Myanmar], not many people would know my opinion and messages like now,” Wirathu told BuzzFeed News, adding that he had always written books and delivered sermons but that the “internet is a faster way to spread the messages.” 41 A quick aside I don’t want to spend much time on my process, but I do want to make a note about the provenance of a document that would otherwise have unclear sourcing. Several accounts of Meta’s role in Myanmar’s persecution of the Rohingya include partial lists of the many warnings people on the ground in Burma—and concerned international human-rights watchers—delivered to Meta executives between 2012 and 2018. Taking on the implications of that litany of warnings and missed chances is what first gave me the first taste of the sinking dread that has characterized my experience of this project. Because of citations in Amnesty International’s big Meta/Myanmar report, I knew there was a “briefing deck” floating around somewhere that had more details, but the closest reference I could find led to a dead URL that Archive.org didn’t have, and emailing around didn’t turn anything up. Eventually, I found a version of it on a French timeline-making site in the form of a heavily annotated timeline, and cross-referenced that version with tweets from Htaike Htaike Aung and Victoire Rio, the women credited in the Amnesty report with making the deck. The URL they link to in the tweets is the dead one, but the preview image in their tweets is an exact match for the timeline I found. I cite this timeline a lot below. The warnings Screenshot of the timeline discussed above. All the way back in November of 2012, Htaike Htaike Aung, MIDO’s program director, speaks with Meta’s Director of Global Public Policy and Policy Director for Europe about the proliferation of hate speech on Facebook at a roundtable in Azerbaijan. Eleven months later, in October 2013, Htaike Htaike Aung brings up her concerns again in the context of “rising inter-communal tensions” at a roundtable discussion in Indonesia attended by three Meta policy executives including the Director of Global Public Policy.42 At the same time, activists and researchers from MIDO and Yangon-based tech-accelerator Phandeeyar “followed up over email to ask for ways to get Facebook to review problematic content and address emergency escalations.” Facebook didn’t respond. MIDO and Phandeeyar staff start doing “targeted research on hate speech.”43 In November of 2013, Aela Callan (whose documentary work I’ve cited) meets with Facebook’s VP of Communications and Public Policy, Eliot Schrage, to warn about anti-Rohingya hate speech—and the fake accounts promoting it—on Facebook.44 After her visit, Meta puts Callan in touch with Internet.org—the global initiative that would eventually cement Facebook’s hegemony in Myanmar, among other places—and with Facebook’s bullying-focused “Compassion Team,” but not with anyone inside Facebook who could actually help.45 In March 2014, four months before deadly, Facebook-juiced riots break out in Mandalay, Htaike Htaike Aung travels to Menlo Park with Aela Callan after RightsCon Silicon Valley. The two women met with members of Meta’s Compassion Team to try once again to get Facebook to pay attention to the threat its service poses in Myanmar. 46 In the same month, Susan Benesch, head of the Dangerous Speech Project, coordinates a briefing call for Meta, attended by half a dozen Meta employees, including Arturo Bejar, head of engineering at Facebook. On the call, Matt Schissler, a Myanmar-based human-rights specialist, delivers a grim assessment describing dehumanizing messages, faked photos, and misinformation spreading on Facebook. In An Ugly Truth: Inside Facebook’s Battle for Domination, their 2021 book about Facebook’s dysfunction, reporters Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang describe Schissler’s presentation: Toward the end of the meeting, Schissler gave a stark recounting of how Facebook was hosting dangerous Islamophobia. He detailed the dehumanizing and disturbing language people were using in posts and the doctored photos and misinformation being spread widely.47 Reuters notes that one of the examples Schissler gives Meta was a Burmese Facebook Page called, “We will genocide all of the Muslims and feed them to the dogs.” 48 None of this seems to get through to the Meta employees on the line, who are interested in…cyberbullying. Frenkel and Kang write that the Meta employees on the call “believed that the same set of tools they used to stop a high school senior from intimidating an incoming freshman could be used to stop Buddhist monks in Myanmar.”49 Aela Callan later tells Wired that hate speech seemed to be a “low priority” for Facebook, and that the situation in Myanmar, “was seen as a connectivity opportunity rather than a big pressing problem.”50 Then comes Mandalay. “Facebook said nothing” I don’t have space to tell the whole story of the 2014 Mandalay violence here—Timothy McLaughlin’s Wired article is good on it—but it has all the elements civil society watchdogs have been worried about: Two innocent Muslim men are falsely accused of raping a Buddhist woman, sensationalist news coverage explodes, and Ashin Wirathu exploits the story to further his cause. Riots break out, and all kinds of wild shit starts circulating on Facebook. This is exactly the kind of situation Htaike Htaike Aung, Callan, Schissler, and others had been warning Meta could happen—but when it actually arrives, no one at Meta picks up the phone. As the violence in Mandalay worsens, the head of Deloitte in Myanmar gets an urgent call. Zaw Htay, the official spokesman of Myanmar’s president, needs help reaching Meta. The Deloitte executive works into the night trying to get someone to respond, but never gets through. On the third day of rioting, the government gets tired of waiting and blocks access to Facebook in Mandalay. The block works—the riots died down. And the Deloitte guy’s inbox suddenly fills with emails from Meta staffers wanting to know why Facebook has been blocked.51 The government wasn’t the only group trying to get through. A few months before, a handful of Facebook employees—including members of policy, legal, and comms teams—had formed a private Facebook group, to allow some of the civil-society experts from Myanmar to flag problems to Facebook staff directly. With false reports and calls to violence beginning to spread on Facebook in Mandalay, Burmese activists and westerners in the private group try to alert Facebook. They get no response, even after the violence turns deadly. A member of the group later tells Frenkel and Kang: When it came to answering our messages about the riots, Facebook said nothing. When it came to the internet being shut down, and people losing Facebook, suddenly, they are returning messages right away. It showed where their priorities are.52 A couple of weeks after the violence in Mandalay in 2014, Facebook’s Director of Policy for the Asia-Pacific region, Mia Garlick, travels to Myanmar for the first time. In a panel discussion, Garlick discusses Meta’s policies and promises to…speed up the translation of Facebook’s Community Standards (its basic content rules) into Burmese. That single piece of translation work—Facebook’s main offering in response to internationally significant ethnic violence about which the company has been warned for two years—takes Meta fourteen months to accomplish and relies, in the end, on the Phandeeyar folks in the private Facebook group.53 Also in 2014, Meta agrees to localize their reporting tool for hate speech and other objectionable content. Meta employees work with MIDO and other Burmese civil-society people to translate and fine-tune the tool, and they launch it by the end of 2014. There’s just one problem: As the Burmese civil society people in the private Facebook group finally learn, Facebook has a single Burmese-speaking moderator—a contractor based in Dublin—to review everything that comes in. The Burmese-language reporting tool is, as Htaike Htaike Aung and Victoire Rio put it in their timeline, “a road to nowhere.”54 Yet more warnings Heading into 2015, the warnings keep coming: February 2015: Susan Benesch, founder and director of the Dangerous Speech Project at the Berkman Klein Center (that’s the Berkman Center as was, for my fellow olds) gives a presentation called “The Dangerous Side of Language” during Compassion Day at Facebook. According to this legal filing for a class-action suit against Meta on behalf of the Rohingya, the presentation explains “how anti-Rohingya speech is being disseminated by Facebook.”55 March 2015: Matt Schissler travels to Menlo Park to meet with Facebook employees in person. Reuters reports that he “gave a talk at Facebook’s California headquarters about new media, particularly Facebook, and anti-Muslim violence in Myanmar. More than a dozen Facebook employees attended, he said.” Frenkel and Kang describe his presentation as documenting “the seriousness of what was happening in Myanmar: hate speech on Facebook was leading to real-world violence in the country, and it was getting people killed.”56 After his meeting at Meta, Schissler has lunch with a few Meta employees, and one of them asked Schissler if he thought Facebook could contribute to a genocide in Myanmar, to which Schissler responded, “Absolutely.” Afterwards, Schissler tells Frenkel and Kang, one Facebook employee loudly remarks, “He can’t be serious. That’s just not possible.”57 PBS Frontline interviewed David Madden in 2018 for its documentary, The Facebook Dilemma; that interview is a good introduction to the dynamics in play. May 2015: Another expert comes to Menlo Park to warn Facebook about the dangerous dynamics it was feeding in Myanmar: David Madden, founder of Phandeeyar, the technology accelerator in Myanmar. In an interview with Amnesty International, Madden reported that “those of us who were working on these issues in Myanmar had a sense that people in Facebook didn’t appreciate the nature of the political situation in the country.”58 In his meeting with Meta, Madden discusses specific examples of dangerous content and drew a direct analogy between radio news in Rwanda and Meta’s role in Myanmar, “meaning it would be the platform through which hate speech was spread and incitements to violence were made.”59 September 2015: Mia Garlick, Facebook’s Director of Public Policy, Asia-Pacific, comes to Myanmar to finally launch Facebook’s Burmese-language Community Standards. Phandeeyar puts together a group of “15+ civil-society leaders from across Myanmar” to brief Garlick “on specific incidents and actors.”60 In an interview with Amnesty International, Victoire Rio reports that several of these leaders specifically tell Garlick that Facebook’s Community Standards aren’t being enforced in Myanmar.61 Which, of course they aren’t: Reuters reports that in 2015, Facebook employed a total of two (2) Burmese-speaking moderators, expanding to four (4) by the year’s end.62 To sum up a little bit, by the end of 2015, Meta knew—as much as any organization can be said to know—that both international civil society experts and the government of Myanmar believe Facebook had a significant role in the 2014 Mandalay riots. And they’d been warned, over and over, that multiple dedicated civil-society and human-rights organizations believed that Facebook was worsening ethnic conflict. They’d been shown example after example of dehumanizing posts and comments calling for mass murder, even explicitly calling for genocide. And David Madden had told Meta staff to their faces that Facebook might well play the role in Myanmar that radio played in Rwanda. Nothing was subtle. After all that, Meta decided not to dramatically scale up moderation capacity, to permanently ban the known worst actors, or to make fundamental product-design changes to reliably deviralize posts inciting hatred and violence. Instead, in 2016, it was time to get way more people in Myanmar onto Facebook. That’s next, in Part II: The Crisis.

When all your see are hate speech posts ( about beheading or at best driving away these low lives), it normalizes the hate and dehumanize the victims. History was full of atrocities like this . Free speech is great to have . But violence propaganda is a real problem. You see some of that in America too.Edit : to give people who don’t bother to read the article some idea, many villages were burned down and before that happened , women got raped and killed , the entire village were looted and then killed and then they burned down the villages. The goal was to create fear so that the victims would have no choice but flee their own country. It worked . reply aragonite 4 hours agoparentYou have to ask yourself why are we obsessed with free speech but you never hear anyone preaching free act? Why the arbitrary restriction to speech&#x2F;expression? Ah, acts can cause harm to others; people can&#x27;t just be allowed to do whatever they want, though they should be allowed to say whatever they want, because you can&#x27;t harm other people by what you say, according to ... the \"sticks and stones\" principle.The entire idea of free speech really rests on something as shaky as the sticks and stones principle! reply 0xDEAFBEAD 4 hours agorootparentFree speech lets us as a society determine which acts should be restricted.My objection to speech restrictionists is that they rarely give a robust mechanism for deciding which speech should be restricted, a mechanism that&#x27;s hardened against people abusing it to further their narrow self-interest.Speech restrictionists also tend to ignore the \"circular dependency problem\": without anyone to defend a position, how do we know if that position is defensible? For example, suppose you live in a theocracy. You&#x27;re an atheist. You start making your case for atheism. Just as you&#x27;re about to make your case, the theocrats interrupt: \"This speech is killing people. It&#x27;s preventing them from reaching the blissful afterlife by converting them to atheism. This person is attempting eternal murder.\" And then throw you in jail.I&#x27;m in favor of a well-designed terms and conditions for a platform like Facebook. But I also think it&#x27;s too easy for people to say: \"I don&#x27;t like what you said! You shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to say it!\" The de facto impact of that rhetoric essentially amounts to mob rule. reply iknowstuff 4 hours agorootparentLook no further than Denmark’s attempt to ban burning of the quran.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;denmark-quran-burning-law-proposa... reply ben_w 3 hours agorootparentDoch[0], never limit yourself to a single example.I grew up in the UK, where teachers at the time were banned by law from saying it was OK to be gay:> \"shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality\" or \"promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship\"- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Section_28And there are socially taboo topics today. I suspect even mentioning some of them here might create a flame war and annoy dang, so I won&#x27;t.Instead I&#x27;ll point to drug references in films and TV, where weed was for a long time as taboo as LSD and heroin; and that in Anglosphere media, sex is more taboo than violence (\"Straight up murder?

Nipples, on mammary glands, the defining characteristic of mammals and a thing that infants have a biological imperative to stick into their mouths in order to not starve to death before the invention of fake ones on milk bottles? Banned for being too sexual.\")Despite these examples of mistakes when restricting speech, I am not a free speech absolutist. This is because I&#x27;m not an anything absolutist: there are limits to all things, finding the true boundaries isn&#x27;t as trivial to pointing out the first two examples that come to mind, if that&#x27;s one on either side saying the standard is half way between them, if they&#x27;re on the same side rejecting the possibility of the other.[0] a German word that should exist in English: to be used to deny a negative, where \"yes\" or \"no\" might be ambiguous. reply kubanczyk 56 minutes agorootparent> [0] a German word that should exist in English: to be used to deny a negative, where \"yes\" or \"no\" might be ambiguous.Do \"ugh\" or \"uhmm\" fit the bill? reply dm319 2 hours agorootparentprevA lot of the problem is definitions.

Is the King simply exercising his rights to free speech? What about paedophiles sharing images?I suspect that it comes down to power imbalances. And that is something difficult to measure. A dictator and an influencer both have power to cause a lot of harm in what they say, as does an adult who shouldn&#x27;t be near a child.I agree with your example of the atheist, and in fact that has been the case for hundreds of years.

After all, if the reason we find the idea of free speech intuitively appealing is because we subscribe to some version of \"speech can do no harm\", why not just base everything upon the more fundamental harm principle (\"one is free to V as long as V-ing causes no harm to others\") which covers both the cases of speech and of act? reply numpad0 1 hour agorootparentprevBecause language is software, mind is hardware and acts are behavior, and we don&#x27;t have toolings necessary to manipulate the software and it&#x27;s dangerous to do things without proper toolings.

I can only assume those commenters haven&#x27;t read the article, which enumerates multiple examples of speech that are equivalent to shouting fire in a crowded theater. reply dannyobrien 7 hours agoparentI not only read the article (which was great), but I was in the same space at this time: one of the civil society groups constantly trying to raise issues with Facebook.It all rings very true to me: I think one thing to note is that not only did Facebook lack Burmese speakers internally, but so did the human rights groups with the best access to Facebook. As Kissane notes, Myanmar came online very quickly after the reforms, and -- unlike many countries in the Middle East or even China, because the story there was not one of authoritarian oppression, but a &#x2F;release&#x2F; from authoritarian pressure, it did not fit easily into the template that tech companies were slowly learning to respond to. A few years before this, Facebook and Twitter had been shaken into some kind of recognition of their responsibilities in the Arab Spring and Iranian protests, but the result of that had been a very, shall we say, US-centric view of how repression plays out globally. Bluntly, the violent genocide of muslims by buddhists, in a country led by Nobel Peace Prize winner and defender of democracy Aung Sang Suu Shi, was a story that had to cut across many political and cultural presumptions of the US and Europe before it would be listened to.I guess that brings me to your comment about \"free speech\". It seems a little petty to point you to the usual put-downs about how the phrase \"shouting fire in a crowded theater\" has historically been deployed to &#x2F;silence&#x2F; people trying to &#x2F;stop&#x2F; mass violence (because they are seen to be trouble-makers).I&#x27;ll note though that the failures of Facebook and others at this time came about because people claimed to be able to moderate and provide a forum where only civil discussion and \"the truth\" would be discussed -- and could be swayed to stop it, if you could just get through to the right people. Many of us, both in \"free speech\" organizations and on-the-ground humanitarian groups, argued that this was a role that Facebook was not, and could not play: and the more it claimed it could take on this responsibility, the more terrible the consequences would be. reply zebomon 6 hours agorootparentThank you very much for your thoughtful reply. I appreciate your note about the history of \"shouting fire in a crowded theater\" as well.As someone who was trying to open Facebook&#x27;s eyes to their shortcomings at the time, what do you see as the larger lesson we can glean? It seems likely that blindness (for any reason) to the specific cultural dangers of new tech will become harder and not easier to spot as time goes on and these large organizations become further convinced of the completeness of their own understanding. I&#x27;d be curious to hear what you&#x27;ve learned generally that we can apply next time. reply dannyobrien 3 hours agorootparentI believed, and still believe, that speech and content moderation simply isn&#x27;t possible at the scales and staffing that Facebook and other tech companies of the 2010s want to operate. Civil society organizations struggled at the time to match and warn Facebook, but I don&#x27;t think they can scale up either. I was at a human rights-related event the other day and somebody talked about leaving behind the \"trashfire\" of the Facebook Oversight Board. I can believe it -- it&#x27;s the sort of solution that you end up having to knit together at those scales. If we seriously believe we can create some sort of global speech government, why haven&#x27;t we?Conversations are intimate, contextual, and should be far more directly under the local control of the speakers. This feels counter-intuitive to many when we see modern genocides like Myanmar and Facebook (and before it, Rwanda and short-wave radio) where mass media played its part in fanning the flames. But censorship and control are temporary fixes to those deeper problems -- and it&#x27;s a solution that feels more comfortable the further you get from the details of each disaster, or the closer and more familiar you are with those with the power to censor.My instincts (and my work) assumes a lot of the problems come, as you say, from the centralization of these large tech organizations, but of course there are also plenty of challenges at the more human level. It&#x27;s significant for me that Western traditions of free speech emerged from decades of vicious religious wars, and appear to be more stable than the cycles of repression and counter-repression that proceeded them. reply bradrn 50 minutes agorootparent> Conversations are intimate, contextual, and should be far more directly under the local control of the speakers.Fair enough… but what about people who use Facebook as a way of broadcasting information? (Such as Ashin Wirathu in the linked article.) To me, that case feels very different to ‘intimite, contextual conversations’. And it is fundamental to Facebook’s design that it blurs the distinction between these two cases.Is the answer then to restrict such things more severely than ordinary conversations? I really have no idea. But our current way of doing things doesn’t seem to be working very well at all. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 6 hours agorootparentprev>I guess that brings me to your comment about \"free speech\".

There can be a feedback loop.In the US, \"freedom of speech\" used to be a left-wing talking point, back when the right had more cultural power. Nowadays it is a right-wing talking point, at a time when the left has more cultural power.We generally can&#x27;t expect censorship mechanisms to be used in a principled way. Censorship mechanisms are powerful political tools that powerful people will fight to obtain, and they will be disproportionately wielded by the powerful. See, for example, Elon Musk&#x27;s purchase of Twitter.Contrast all that with the Facebook&#x2F;Myanmar situation, which I suspect is more a case of criminal apathy and&#x2F;or greed. reply CrazyPyroLinux 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ll admit I don&#x27;t know anything about the situation, but the phrase \"violent genocide of muslims by buddhists\" was NOT something I was expecting to hear anywhere. reply dannyobrien 6 hours agorootparentIndeed, that&#x27;s part of the point here. reply v3ss0n 4 hours agorootparentprevThe correct Phrase would be Genocide of Rohinja by a Terrorist Military Junta.Now they are killing whole country , regardless of age , sex, reglion and skin color. reply roenxi 8 hours agoprevThe attack on Meta here isn&#x27;t really justified for the reasons Kissane seems to be providing. Take this paragraph, for example:> By that point in 2018, Myanmar’s military had murdered thousands of Rohingya people, including babies and children, and beaten, raped, tortured, starved, and imprisoned thousands more. About three-quarters of a million Rohingya had fled Myanmar to live in huge, disease-infested refugee camps in Bangladesh.That is the situation on the ground. The country is a powder keg, and there is evil afoot. Maybe there is more context here to come in part II, but it seems unreasonable to lay this at Facebook&#x27;s feet from an external perspective. Facebook does not call for beatings, rape or killings.I can certainly see Facebook&#x27;s leadership caring about the PR and doing something. But that raises alternative problems - what exactly is the standard Facebook is meant to enforce? Should it ban everyone who is responsible for pointless killing? That includes the US leadership apparatus - should it ban everyone who voted Aye for the Iraq war? Afghanistan? Wars like Vietnam? (yes, the people who voted for it knew better). They won&#x27;t do that. We&#x27;ll have a large, powerful company applying uneven and subjective standards.There is an issue there, but I think the specifics of why she is calling out Facebook are actually dangerously missing the point. The problem is the same no matter what influence Facebook tries to have - the problem is that the will of the people and the will of Facebook&#x27;s leadership are radically different. In this case, the will of the people is unusually evil - but the problem is the clash and Facebook&#x27;s position of influence, not which side is wrong on any particular day. Eventually, Facebook will be on the evil side. reply botanical 7 hours agoparentFacebook didn&#x27;t remove posts promoting ethnic violence in a timeous manner.

They start actively influencing elections worldwide to shape a pro-Facebook political consensus.Case 2 is better than 1, but given 3 there is a strong argument that the conversation is being misframed focusing on Facebook&#x27;s policies. The case where they act and succeed is just as worrying as when they do nothing. Possibly more so, given that there is no evidence at all that Facebook pushing political opinions will result in good outcomes.

This article is strong evidence that very bad people use Facebook, but it isn&#x27;t at all clear that Facebook should be considered morally involved based on what has been presented seen so far.Maybe the killing blow is yet to come. But I&#x27;m pretty sure any objective standard that gets Facebook in trouble here will get them in just as much trouble for letting Victoria Newland or US 4 star generals post publicly. There are a lot if brutes in public office.Furthermore getting involved in matters of war and peace is not a role that Facebook will get praise for, it&#x27;ll do some really terrible things if it goes down that path.

Your comment would largely apply only to active seekers of said content. reply spongebobstoes 1 hour agorootparentI don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple. \"The algorithm\" historically favoured engaging posts, which basically means \"what people care about\".This same algorithm pushes all the good things that someone like Wirathu was doing (for the Buddhist population) as well as the horrific things (promoting genocide).So let&#x27;s talk about the obvious -- disabling \"the algorithm\". With no algorithm the problem might be even worse! If someone like Wirathu runs 20 accounts which each post 10+ times per day, his genocidal speech might be even more over-represented to the general populace. Timeline order rewards spammers, which rewards people with resources to simply scale output to more of the same.Well ok, why not improve the algorithm then? It&#x27;s easy to say \"just promote the good stuff\", but it&#x27;s very difficult to do in practice at scale. Let&#x27;s examine why.Since it&#x27;s all happening in Burmese, any ML models for sentiment or radicalization or hate speech will hugely lag behind English in effectiveness. A poorly trained auto-moderator is often worse than none at all, because it acts at random.It is also a cat and mouse game -- simple models are stymied by basic (for humans) techniques like misspelling, swapping letters for symbols, inventing new slang words, dogwhistles, appropriating benign words, etc.Ok, so why not scale up moderation? Well, they need to find sufficient Burmese speakers who can be in person in their offices. (In person because of data protection and resources like mental health support.)It&#x27;s not a popular language, so finding any candidates is already difficult, let alone people who are willing to wade through the horrors of humanity day after day for a paycheck. reply totetsu 1 hour agorootparentWhy not stop providing services if you cant scale the safety mechanisms that go with them?

Meta faced two problems in Myanmar: (1) not enough Facebook users, and (2) increasing incitement and hate speech that was clearly and repeatedly stoking anti-Rohingya violence.

Though I guess those discussions&#x2F;emails would be very unlikely to come out except in a court case and I’m not sure what case that would be.If you look at the things Facebook work on, it does seem that they do care a lot about not wanting various kinds of bad behaviour on their platform. I don’t know if the scope was materially narrower in the past or if this was a problem of being too disconnected from the users in Myanmar (ie language barriers or applying policies designed for the US).I have a hard time thinking about the counterfactuals. Could this have happened with Twitter for example? It feels to me like the biggest advantage facebook had was being subsidised and if it didn’t have the advantage (and maybe if prices had gone down a bit over a few years) the same thing could have happened over Twitter. It’s not clear to me how much the government wanted the genocide to happen.

They entered a coalition with the National League for Democracy (Aung Sang Syu Ki&#x27;s party) and even got an Ethnic Affairs Minister [2] - that they held on to during the Genocide.That said, the issues in Rakhine were further exacerbated by the India-China rivalry, as both countries turned a blind eye to the Tatmadaw and would arm ethnic militias within Rakhine and across Myanmar in general, as Myanmar is a buffer between the two countries, ethnic issues in Myanmar blowback across Southwest China (eg. Kokang Chinese * ) and Northeast India (eg.

The main problem is political players are using Racism , Nationalism , Brainwash , Multimedia as a tool to induce instability so they can go back to non-democratic country , just to take back our freedom.The violence aren&#x27;t real cause by hatespeech on the Facebook. Sure it increased Racism by a lot but also it leads to find out about truth fast.The actual genocide ware done by the Junta military and Junta assigned thugs who are infused within riots are by a group known as Ma Ba Tha , which was known before as Swan Arr Shin ( Meaning Super Heros) - which ironically used to kill peacefully protesting monks back in 2007 (Saffron Revolution), Now they are known as Pyu Saw Htee who are killing innocent people now regardless of Race or Ethnicity in suspicion of supporting Spring Revolution.They are Ex Junta , Prisoners , low ranking members from the Rival Hardline Military Party lead by extremist nationalists . They are the one who raze and displaced millions of Rohingyas.The start of Rohingya crisis :- At first when the news breakout that innocent girl was raped and killed , the uncensored mutilated body of the underage girl along with caught preps had been posted online who are identified as rohingyas, that is the first time many people had seen violence on the Facebook and it was spread like wild fire , and there was a lot of hate online.- And then. The MaBaTha movement started ( the group i mentioned above) , goes on ground , spreading the image of the post , they organize and formed other nationalists , and then they started using monks , most of them are military spies robed and planted into there since after Saffron Revolution - as a tool for political play.- Soon after they started using monks many real Buddhist are shunning away and stop following as soon as they started using Buddhism as a tool for violence which is totally against buddha&#x27;s ways and it become appearant that is a political play. - But the riots were organized by military , in Meikhtila case , polices guards the people who burned the whole town to ashes - who are Later Identified as MaBaTha .So here is take away- The crisis is totally fuled by junta nad organized by Junta Swann Arr Shin group ( MaBaTha , and now Pyu Saw Htee) (The organized criminal group , members existed since 1988, used again and again in 1988 , De Pe Yin massacre , Saffron Revolution) .- If there were no Facebook , the Junta would use state owned media and journal outlets and would have the same effect but because of Facebook we have a chance to speak-out , we have a chance to find out truth, report massacres .- Free Speech is very important for us , for a country who had lost freedom for 70+ Years- Free Speech and Facebook has to do very little on Rohingya crisis since it is mostly done by the on-ground , organized criminal .- Facebook Algorithms boost controversial topics that is undeniable- Rohingya genocide was a military sponsored terrorism it was fueled by Military Junta and hard liners and organized criminal group founded by junta.- When the crisis had been controlled by Democratic government , the military start to lose power so they stage a coup in 2021Now situation is a lot worseThe Junta who organized the Rohingya crisis , stage a coup and killed over 5000 innocent civilians of all races and genders , and that had lead to people arming up and fighting against Junta .

The primary person the article cites was a Buddhist monk from what I understand. reply v3ss0n 5 hours agorootparentBudhhism can be mainly catgeorized as follow- Theravada Buddhism- Mahayana BuddhismThose are original but in myanmar.- Real Buddhist Who actually practices meditation and dharma- Buddhist because of Ancestors- MaBaTha Nationaist Buddhist - All about nationalistom actually which is brain washed and organized by junta.- Nat Koe Buddhist , who is not after dharma , but follows rites , traditional spirit worshippingThose latter 2 sact are the ones recurited into MaBaThaThat monk is a military planted spy especially for Rohingya crisis. He was pictured together with ex spy chief after coup. reply yorwba 1 hour agorootparentprev> we don&#x27;t even know Rohingya race exist at allIt has been long-standing government policy to deny the existence of Rohingya as an ethnic group, claiming that they&#x27;re immigrants from Bangladesh, in order to deny them citizenship; this being a manifestation of pre-existing prejudice towards Muslims&#x2F;Rohingya by the dominant political groups, both military junta and democratically elected civilians. (Though I think attributing this to Buddhists in general is just as much a mistake as attributing a crime to Muslims in general.)So it&#x27;s unsurprising if you hadn&#x27;t heard anything negative about Rohingya, but maybe you heard something negative about ကုလား or some other moniker meant to deny them recognition.Aung San Suu Kyi herself famously refused to even utter the word \"Rohingya\" while defending her dear generals against the genocide accusations, so I don&#x27;t think you can put blame only on the junta&#x2F;USDP and absolve the NLD from all responsiblity.Recently, the NUG has started making noise about finally reforming the citizenship law, so maybe the situation will improve in the future, but I could also see them renege on their promises in the event they win the civil war and are no longer as reliant on international support. reply zmmmmm 5 hours agorootparentprevthanksIt sounds bad but it does still sound primarily like neglect and not some kind of genuine active involvement, as I hear frequently suggested. reply harmmonica 5 hours agorootparentI might be the most naive person on Earth for thinking this, but I can’t imagine any circumstance where this was anything but neglect on FB’s part. Or maybe neglect isn’t the right word. Maybe FB, like so many tech companies, optimized for the wrong metrics. So it’s more proactive than neglect? If your audience is a vampire and you want to get engagement you show a lot of bulging veins. I don’t mean to suggest that the broader Buddhist population (ie most of Myanmar) is bloodthirsty, but if a tiny (tiny!) slice of it had hate on the mind it’s not hard to understand the argument that FB amplified the bloodlust (wow, look at the spike in engagement on the internal dashboard!). Chart goes up and to the right and some PM gets paid. And it’s super bad when it’s the ruling government (the Junta in this case) that’s the vampire, as a sibling comment contends. All so brutal. reply charcircuit 9 hours agoprevFree speech is important. People don&#x27;t get mad at air because it allows people to transmit their thoughts.

I wish there are non-algorithmic , un-mainipulatble , non-moderated platform that can be reached out to the world. reply brg 8 hours agoparentprevWhile air is a passive requirement, I would suggest that writing, the printing press, speakers, radio, television, and the web are all more similar. They are intentionally used to increase engagement of content intentionally created. reply dwrodri 8 hours agoparentprevI respect agree with your belief that freedom of speech is important, but I disagree with your conclusion that \"Internet companies transmitting people&#x27;s ideas\" is no different. The key idea here is that freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach: Facebook might give everyone the same text box to write posts or upload content, but they need to answer for HOW and WHY they recommend certain content over other types of content.The comparison pencils or air isn&#x27;t fair because they aren&#x27;t being boosted by a recommender system, powering the application layer of the content delivery platform for 90% of a country&#x27;s people. If I write a message on paper containing a call to action which incites violence (e.g. \"We should round up all people with six toes on each foot and shoot them\") and hand it to one person, the message has reached one person. I would say, the digital equivalent to \"pencil and paper\" or \"talking in a public square\" more like \"Writing a message in an HTML file and putting that HTML on a web server you own.\" I think it would be much more difficult for your average user in Myanmar to reach millions, even if they were given a web server and the means to write HTML.Comparing it to \"getting mad at air because it allows people to transmit their thoughts\" equates Facebook the Internet, when one is an organization of people who provide technology and the other is technology. There are data scientists and engineers who created the models which learned how to optimize for engagement, and there are product managers who help set the KPIs for those engineers (i.e. encouraged them to solve for engagement) and there are execs who benefit from all of the above. While no single person is solely to blame for what happened in Myanmar, it&#x27;s wrong to claim that we can&#x27;t at least reason and discuss the products still created, maintained and own by company (made of people).My opinion on this is heavily formed by the training I received when I wanted to DJ for my university&#x27;s radio station. Even in the US, where freedom of speech is protected in the Amendments to the Consitution, there were very specific things you could and could not say on the air (while being classified as a non-profit radio station). You could receive massive fines for profanity, obscenity, inciting violence, hate speech, with a large general emphasis on calls to action. Generally, I think this training was good and it encouraged everyone who learned to DJ to be more intentional with their language.I really think that if Facebook is gonna enable users to reach millions, there absolutely should be some caveats to that. People should be able to say whatever they want if they are capable of providing the means by which their own speech is amplified--and even then there are clear cases where the megaphone needs to be taken away.Facebook is giving megaphones to people and some people use it to dispense hate speech. While I might&#x27;ve been willing to give Facebook a pass in their early years, it is clear that between Cambridge Analytica and this that governments around the world need to do better when it comes to working with Facebook to better identify content on their platform which incites violence or calls to action which present a clear and present danger to other people if acted upon. Facebook isn&#x27;t some amorphous inanimate entity that we can&#x27;t negotiate&#x2F;regulate&#x2F;punish. If someone uploads a hateful message which has a 0.00001% of encouraging a hate crime in Burma, Burma can expect around 5 hate crimes as a result of this message. With great power comes great responsibility. reply charcircuit 8 hours agorootparent>Facebook might give everyone the same text box to write posts or upload content, but they need to answer for HOW and WHY they recommend certain content over other types of content.It seems that Facebook&#x27;s \"crime\" is not censoring people enough and not not their reccomendation algorithm was configured to boost an opinion the article&#x27;s author did not agree with.

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP SECURITY 15 Norway wants Facebook behavioral advertising banned across Europe But Meta was just about to start asking people for their permission! Jude Karabus Fri 29 Sep 2023 // 13:45 UTC Norway has told the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) it believes a countrywide ban on Meta harvesting user data to serve up advertising on Facebook and Instagram should be made permanent and extended across Europe. The Scandinavian country's Data Protection Authority, Datatilsynet, had been holding back Facebook parent Meta from scooping up data on its citizens with the threat of fines of one million Kroner (about $94,000) per day if it didn't comply. In August, it said Meta hadn't been playing ball and started serving up the daily fines. However, the ban that resulted in these fines, put into place in July, expires on November 3 – hence Norway's request for a \"binding decision.\" The July order came after a Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruling [PDF] earlier that month stating Meta's data processing operation was also hauling in protected data – race and ethnicity, religious affiliation, sexual orientation etc. – when it cast its behavioral ads net. Norway is not a member of the EU but is part of the European single market, and the CJEU, as Europe's top court, has the job of making sure the application and interpretation of law within the market is compliant with European treaties (this part would apply to Norway) as well as ensuring that legislation adopted by the EU is applied the same way across all Member States. Datatilsynet's ruling said the central processing of that data by the American company was putting Meta in violation of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. Meta argued at the time that it already had users' consent for targeted advertising – because they clicked on the Ts&Cs when they signed up to its services, but the CJEU didn't buy that argument. Datatilsynet, meanwhile, said this week: We believe that our temporary ban must be made permanent. Furthermore, we believe that the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) must be interpreted consistently throughout the EU/EEA, and we ask for the ban to be extended to the rest of Europe. Norway court upholds miniscule fine against Meta for flouting privacy rules Norway to hit Meta with fines over Facebook user privacy from next week Norway bans Meta's behavioral advertising with threats of wrist-slap fines NY Attorney General warns Apple, Google to police COVID-19 tracing apps in their souks – or she will herself Meta has disputed the attempt to refer the whole shebang to the EDPB. Datatilsynet said the company believes, \"among other things, that the decision of the Norwegian DPA is invalid and that the DPA does not have a legal basis to request a binding decision from the EDPB.\" Meta, which has been fielding GDPR lawsuits in Europe and the UK for years, said last month it would seek explicit consent from people in the EU, EEA, and Switzerland before using their data to serve up ads targeted at them personally. A spokesperson for Facebook's parent company told us it was \"surprised\" by the Norwegian authority's actions, \"given that Meta has already committed to moving to the legal basis of consent for advertising in the EU/EEA.\" It added: \"We remain in active discussions with the relevant data protection authorities on this topic via our lead regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and will have more to share in due course.\" The United Kingdom was notably absent from that list of countries that Meta is moving to a \"consent\" basis for processing, despite the rules being roughly the same under UK GDPR. The British government is in the process of trying to replace the EU legislation – which is still part of UK law under the Data Protection Act – by passing the Data Protection and Digital Information bill. The new bill, on the face of it, removes several data subject protections including oversight of public surveillance cameras, and potentially data adequacy with the EU, affecting every UK business that collects and processes EU data. Lawmakers behind the bill have criticized the GDPR for having an \"overemphasis on consent.\" Meta's Twitter-alike platform, Threads, landed in the UK but not the EU in July, along with a massive laundry list of user data permissions requests. We wonder if Meta knows something we don't. ® Sponsored: Driving down the cost of Office applications MORE ABOUT 15 COMMENTS Data Protection GDPR Meta More like these TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Irish watchdog fines TikTok €345M for mishandling kids' data Tok is Tiking for app to bring processing into compliance within 3 months NETWORKS 15 days6 Zuck dives deeper into the metaverse, dragging Snoop Dogg along for ride Meta's annual conference sees the company playing catch-up to OpenAI but pulling ahead of Apple OFFBEAT 2 days11 Zuck uses India visit to increase Meta's transactional traction WhatsApp gets better at taking money and so does Meta with verified accounts for biz SOFTWARE 9 daysWhy putting off refresh cycles puts off power users and younger workers alike How Intel vPro remediates the parts other tools can’t reach SPONSORED FEATURE Meta spends $181M to get out of lease at vacant London offices Biz signed 20-year term in 2021 before COVID-19 caused the WFH revolution followed by redundancies ON-PREM 3 days38 Norway court upholds miniscule fine against Meta for flouting privacy rules Targeted ads require data usage consent under EU regulations PERSONAL TECH 23 days33 Portable Large Language Models – not the iPhone 15 – are the future of the smartphone COLUMN Personal AI can redefine the handheld experience and perhaps preserve privacy too PERSONAL TECH 17 days65 If you like to play along with the illusion of privacy, smart devices are a dumb idea UPDATED You're just giving manufacturers carte blanche to profit off personal data SECURITY 23 days133 Lawsuit claims Tesla corp data security is far less advanced than its cars Sueball alleges company at fault after employee info leaked, including Musk's SECURITY 23 days7 How to ask Facebook's Meta to not train its AI models on some of your personal info Hey, stop Zucking up my data!

Watching ads pays for nothing. People buying stuff with some ad budget included in the price is what pays for that content. The entire thing is essentially like a tax collected with everything you buy, then part of the money gets spend to produce ads and run the entire ad industry, the rest is distributed among everyone displaying the ads. Even if I block every ad, I am still paying for them, I am still paying for the content.And if you are getting a subscription to get rid of the ads, then you are actually paying twice - not only directly with your subscription but you are also still paying into all the ad budgets when you buy stuff. reply dylan604 16 hours agorootparentYou watching the ad is not what gets money to transfer. The person wanting to show an ad pays for someone to show the ad. In theory, the larger number of eyes available to view the ad can demand a higher price for the privilege of showing the ad. The per-click concept of paying for ads is very disingenuous. You provide a monthly budget, and the ad provider will show you charts of how you got exactly that many clicks, regardless of budget. reply danbruc 16 hours agorootparentI already gave them my money, just distribute it among the websites I visit and do not bother me with your ads. reply mostlylurks 17 hours agorootparentprevMany of the freely available things I consume online are funded by voluntary support from dedicated groups of fans, on patreon etc, and which spread mostly by word of mouth. This requires neither a subscription for the content in question nor any purchase of it. Thus, at least one business model exists which can sustain freely available content without relying on ads, and thus, not all free content would disappear if we banned ads. reply moate 18 hours agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not wrong, but you think too small. Ads existed well before the internet, and are so ingrained in the world at large that as a thought experiment this is up there with \"what would we miss if we removed the concept of murder&#x2F;books&#x2F;good&#x2F;etc. entirely\".What does \"the concept of ads\" mean? Is it advertising if I say \"I bought a really great hammer from place, you should also get one if you want a great hammer\" to a friend? I literally cannot think of a world in which you can only remove ads and not blow up literally every paradigm of how we deal with resources and their distribution. reply dylan604 17 hours agorootparentwhy does one assume that because i&#x27;m playing devil&#x27;s advocate means that&#x27;s how i think? your premise is greatly flawed. reply olalonde 16 hours agoparentprevRemoving ads would disadvantage less affluent people and youth, as many free services like online platforms and social media are funded by advertising. This indirect subsidy from wealthier consumers who buy advertised products would vanish if ads were eliminated. Likely, services would introduce paywalls as an alternative revenue source, making access harder for those unable to pay.Moreover, ads would be replaced by something worse. Without ads, companies would still market their products, but in more covert and potentially deceptive ways. This could lead to less transparency and potentially more manipulative tactics, making it harder for consumers to discern genuine content from promotional material. Journalists would be given free stuff, get invited to parties, there would be product placement everywhere, endorsements, etc. reply timeon 14 hours agorootparent> replaced by something worseNot if it is regulated.Maybe there would be less online platforms but there would be some community driven as they were before. This mindset that ads are necessary sounds like Stockholm syndrome at best, gaslighting at worst. reply olalonde 14 hours agorootparentIt has more to do about humility than \"Stockholhm syndrome\" or \"gas lighting\". Who are we to take away the ad-supported platforms from the people who want them or need them, because they can&#x27;t afford to pay?Community driven platforms exist today. We don&#x27;t even need to ban the ad-supported platforms to have them.By the way, I think you may be looking at the past with rosy glass or perhaps didn&#x27;t live through it. Because advertising on the web used to be a lot more distracting and distasteful. There were popups all over the place, full page animated banner ads, etc. reply danbruc 15 hours agorootparentprevCompanies could just not produce and show ads but keep the ad budget in their prices and keep spending it. Yes, this will of course not work, this will screw up all kinds of incentives, but then lets make it a tax and let the state send a cent every time I visit a website. Free internet services for everyone just like we could do free public transportation. Not sure if this could work and even if then it would probably be more complicated, but I have serious doubts that the ad based system we have right now is the only, best or most efficient system. reply robador 18 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been thinking about this recently, and I don&#x27;t think I would actually mind personalised ads.

Putting a sign out front of your business with your logo is advertising, though it also helps your customers find you. You are advertising your location.How would you know where a restaurant is or what it serves if they did not have a logo or a menu located outside on their window? All of this is advertising.What is immoral is advertising that holds your attention hostage. Advertising should be able to be rejected, or skipped.I don&#x27;t have to read a billboard. I don&#x27;t want to stare at it for 5 seconds before saying \"Skip Billboard\". I just don&#x27;t look at it.Instagram does a great job of this with Reels. I can just swipe past a reel that&#x27;s an ad. I can&#x27;t even tell you what the last ad I saw on Instagram was, period.In my opinion, advertising should be an inefficient way of communicating your services &#x2F; products. Commercials, in-stream ads, popups, anything that forces you to interact with an advertisement should be banned, and any personalization of advertisements should also be banned. reply chrisoconnell 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s interesting though, to imagine a dystopian future where instead of red lights, we are stopped by ads that we must watch before progressing through an intersection, and the advertisements are spaced perfectly to control traffic patterns.Samsung should hire me to design their next smart city, imo. reply colmmacc 17 hours agoparentprevWe generally believe and accept what we encounter repeatedly. Our truth building faculties are premised on nature. The river always swells after a big rain. Advertising and propaganda exploit this and can cement false \"truths\" in our culture and consciousness. But I wonder if modern brand advertising is even more powerful.\"Familiarity\" and \"Familial\" share the same root. Our children resemble ourselves and our relatives. When I see my son&#x27;s smile, I see my father&#x27;s. When he giggles, I hear my wife&#x27;s laugh. In history, our villages and regions are more self-similar than any two random people in the world. Inwardly, these similarities and recognitions trigger love and care, and outwardly they play a role in sustaining familial and cultural trust. We should always question and challenge that role, and increase our circle of empathy, it is repugnant to justify racism as some do with this line of reasoning. But the effects are there and it is counterproductive that by selling prominence and placement which even our own families can&#x27;t match, we allow brands to purchase a kind of kinship. reply throwaway94373 17 hours agoparentprevWhat&#x27;s wrong with advertising in general exactly?

Many many ads are based on inciting fear, so even if they \"don&#x27;t work\" on you in the sense of getting you to buy a product, they might still work on you in the sense of inciting fear. They even managed to sell candy bars based on fear: if you&#x27;re hungry you might get grumpy and will be socially ostracized. Air fresheners are sold with the message that people will dislike you if your house stinks. Ads for gambling usually target sad and lonely people in a pretty obvious way (\"if you win the lottery you&#x27;ll have friends\").There are other techniques too.

So EU tech start-ups tend to languish in obscurity to a far greater degree, which means less of a feedback loop to improve the product, which overall means less tech wins in europe.Start-ups follow a power law where most fail, but 5% succeed. This means you need a lot of shots on goal. When every shot on goal takes 3x the effort and cost...It&#x27;s not just tech privacy regulations by any means, but all of this together means that the gap between the US and EU continues to accelerate.

And those policies are always a one way street whether it benefited every one or not in retrospect.What&#x27;s the end goal? A perfectly regulated, moral economy that never grows and relies on immigrants to stabilize GDP numbers?If these new regs also came at the same pace as reforms for previous ones that actively hurt these countries it&#x27;d be way easier to agree with as a general rule.

Perhaps you think this particular one is fine, but in general I agree with the sentiment that the regulatory approach in EU hinders progress and economic growth for not so tangible trade-offs. reply FirmwareBurner 16 hours agorootparentSure, but Europe&#x27;s inability to compete with the US in consumer facing software is not because EU as stricter privacy regulations, but because of its incredibly diverse linguistic, legal and cultural fragmentation which makes gaining \"escape velocity\" a huge challenge for any business not just tech, versus the US where (nearly) everyone is an American citizen (there is no EU citizenship) and speaks the same language everywhere (there is no EU language) and has similar culture, business, spending habits, regardless of state.Gaining escape velocity is just not possible in the EU where every member state still has full legal sovereignty, a different language, different governing and business laws, different governing body, different economy, sometimes different currency, different legal framework, different military and different consumer habits. The EU has unified some items like the currency for most members and some common laws, but still too few compared to the US which is a full-on country, not a membership of sovereign nations.Also, while the US has undoubtably won the tech war financially speaking, due to it being unscrupulous at any level including privacy and justifying it to itself as \"well China does it anyway so we should do it too otherwise we loose\", but if you were to ask the average American on the street, and especially those queuing at the blood-bank to donate blood the second time this month to afford to pay bills, what would they prefer to have, either Europe&#x27;s social benefits or the US winning the tech superiority and having the most tech billionaires, I think the answer would be clear and not the one you&#x27;d like to hear. reply cm2012 15 hours agorootparentThe privacy regulations are brutal though. Let me give you an example.Say you want to target HR decision makers using Facebook ads. The most efficient and cutting edge way (that we do in the USA) is make a broad, master audience to target, and use \"conversion events\" (something that happens on your website that correlations to revenue later, like a qualified lead coming) to train the Meta algorithm to find more of them.In Europe you used to be able do this across the entire EU, the Meta would target efficiently and could automatically use different language ads. Because FB&#x27;s targeting algorithm is such a powerful AI, it could find qualified leads.Now, many EU companies feel they can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t use the tags or server to server integrations needed to power conversion events. Which means they have to do manual campaigns by country which is much less efficient.This is just one solid example of many I&#x27;ve run into. reply FirmwareBurner 15 hours agorootparent>Say you want to target HR decision makers using Facebook ads.

Some modern AI tools are getting a late release in Europe because of regulation, some major apps like Threads are not even released here.And for what? Some of our governments are still part of mass surveillance initiatives. Spying apps like TikTok and Facebook are able to hoover up data because people simply want to give it to them.

    "originBody": "Skip to content PRDeving typeof FUN MENU MMO Architecture: Source of truth, Dataflows, I/O bottlenecks and how to solve them By certain absurdities of life that only someone whose hobby perfectly aligns with his job can understand, lately I’ve been involved in the design and architecture of an MMO game. As much as it may seem that such an application fits perfectly in what we would unconsciously consider “distributed architectures“, the specific details (small and large) of this kind of solutions turn what, for any capable engineer would be a simple design process into a headache of biblical proportions. Latencies, race conditions, synchrony and availability is something that every architect faces, practically every day, however, in practically all scenarios, the solution is a renegotiation of the functional and technical requirements (is it enough to have latency less than 10 seconds?) and rarely do we design complete solutions due to their complexity. The world of multiplayer video games is kinda different, the spatial complexity goes to infinity, and we try to keep the temporal one to a minimum. We work with multiple strictly deterministic modules that we can easily maintain and deploy in parallel. And sooner or later, we will hit hell, an evil that lurks behind every MMO, the I/O bottleneck in the database. The main purpose of this post is to explore the limitations that we find at the data I/O level in the design of MMO systems, the interactions that the system makes with the data, its derived problems and how to solve them. In addition, we will suffer the cognitive dissonance in its purest state, since the solutions that are adopted in MMO type systems are a certain death in an enterprise environment (e-commerce?). Advertisement It is interesting to see how different the solutions are depending on the problem and the system requirements. The beauty of software architecture ❤ the source of truth of your game world IS NOT the database. This is a complicated concept to accept for those of us who come from enterprise systems, but it is so. In online games, the source of truth of the state of the world is the in-memory world state, not the database. In these cases, we consider the database a persistence medium, not a source of truth. Whereas the real source of truth of the virtual world we are concerned with always resides in memory. Heresy! well, a little bit. let’s go deeper into this concept with MATH. let’s say we have a MMORPG game like world of warcraft with 1000 players, its world is of course divided into zones, so that we can do sharding. what we are interested in here, however, is that all players live together in the same environment. They have to be able to see each other, talk to each other, pass items from one to another, see the level of other players in the world, and so on. By pure data logic, for this to work in normal terms the state of the world has to be unique. Let’s assume that these players just go around, happily killing boars. Let’s also assume that our game client, in order to make life easier for our infrastructure, sends the players’ actions to the server once per second. Knowing how to multiply is enough to realize that we would be talking about N player position update messages sent per second, where N is the number of players. And that’s only taking into consideration the position of the players in the world! Now you have to add experience gained, sword strokes, chat messages, etc. Considering our database as the source of truth, it forces us to persist all this information, which, to put it mildly, is N writings per second. Best of luck. The solution to such a problem is relatively simple once we get rid of the idea of using the database as the source of truth. Cache, lots of cache When I said earlier that the source of truth of the game world state resides in memory I meant it, though not in the simplest sense. In these cases our requirements are not too many, though complicated: we need direct and low latency connection between game services and world state. we need the world state to be persisted in order to replicate or recover from errors or outages we need it to be scalable for the future we need to avoid race conditions To meet these specifications, we usually use a data broker pattern. We create a service with direct connection to the database that will keep the full state in memory and connect our game world services to it via RPC. So it acts as a kind of cache of the database. But how does this meet the requirements? Let’s go in parts We need direct and low latency connection between game services and world state. This is perhaps the simplest part, our game world services connect by RPC to the game state service and execute actions. Here comes an important point that, although perhaps slightly out of the scope of this post, is worth mentioning. These RPC commands must be specific to our game logic, no SQL or obscure requests linked to persistence or the concept of “data”! grantPlayerExperience, playerChangingZone, etc. It is the data service that is responsible for implementing the API so that, when it receives a “grantPlayerExperience” command, it adds N experience points to the player X. This way, we keep our layers separate, we decouple the data API from the implementation and keep our game logic isolated. We need the world state to be persisted in order to replicate or recover from errors or outages Persist yes, but What and When? this is more of a philosophical and product design job than software architecture per se, but let’s see how we can dig into it a bit. The first question is, how much is acceptable? sometimes we tend to think that even the smallest movement is likely to be saved for posterity, but often it is not. Let’s take for example the game League of Legends, what would we save and when in this case? If you ask me, I would save the final state of the game, once it is finished (we ignore replays, obeservability, etc for this example). The reasons are simple, in a system of this type, we look for persistence to be able to recover from problems, not as a business definition. Let’s suppose that we are saving EVERY change throughout the game and our instance explodes, goes offline or is sucked into the infinite void of space. Can we recover from that error? Can we restore the last saved state? No, we can’t. It is likely that, by the time we restore the state, half of the players will no longer be connected. So what are we going to persist all the changes in the database for? The tricky part here, as I said above, is what to save and when to save it. In the case of the example, what do we save? well, the player’s stats at the end of the game and little else. When? at the end of the game. In a more complex case like World of warcraft, we could save, for example: the inventory when an item changes hands or is used, the player’s position every certain time (30 seconds maybe?), the zone every time the player changes, etc. The trick is to minimize as much as possible the writes to persistence by writing only those things that are essential for recovery. everything else, we keep it in memory in the game state service. We need it to be scalable for the future Here perhaps we touch on one of the tricky points. In terms of scalability, having a service that has the entire world state in memory is perhaps not the best option a priori, since, although it is easy to scale it vertically, horizontal scaling runs into several problems. Apart from being a single point of failure, an important issue that I will not cover in this post. A relatively simple solution may be to take advantage of the Redis pub/sub system to synchronize the state services. Also, let’s think about it this way, if you have 100 game world services acting against a single state service, we are talking about 100 open sockets, it is not comparable with the amount of thousands of database commands that we would have if we ignore the broker, right? We need to avoid race conditions This is perhaps the most trivial point, since, as long as we maintain a single-threaded architecture in our data service, it is practically guaranteed that we will not have significant race conditions. However, when working with distributed data or in multi-threaded environments we have a great friend. CAS (Compare-and-swap) every write operation performed on our data services should be done with a CAS instruction, so that we make sure that our writes are synchronous. The thing is simple, you take a hash of the state (or a part of it) before starting the operation which we will call, version hash. You prepare the new state, generate a hash for the new state and ONLY persist the two things if the version hash of the state matches the one you took at the beginning. A simple version control system and what happens if the CAS fails? retry, N times, as many as you think, and if it is not possible, return error. Understanding the state of our game world as ephemeral, and knowing how to identify the exact data amenable to persistence is perhaps more of a learned art than a teachable science. In summary, when working in high traffic distributed systems, with many agents constantly changing dynamic data, considering the database as the source of truth leads to bottlenecks and availability problems sooner rather than later. Strategies, perhaps counter-intuitive or heretical to those of us who come from enterprise architectures, are usually the standard solution accepted by the industry. Not without their own problems and weaknesses. A good planning of the update and persistence windows of our data and a thorough analysis of our system’s “use cases” and scenarios, together with a data broker pattern allows us to free the database from unnecessary writes and our wallets from bulging invoices. Understanding the state of our game world as ephemeral, and knowing how to identify the exact data amenable to persistence is perhaps more of a learned art than a teachable science.

I did some optimization work earlier this year on a project where the single back-end server is now handling 2 billion requests per minute and had around 3TB of RAM for cache (I think the final production system was aiming for 12TB of RAM).There&#x27;s concerns around race conditions as you pointed out, message passing from client to server, and server to server, client hand-off between sharded servers. Those synchronization problems will haunt your dreams.I think the biggest issue I still struggle with is tracking those ephemeral problems that only happen on one shard, or only when going between this shard and this shard, but not the other way. One useful trick is obviously message prioritization and different messages heading to different servers - though these days I&#x27;d put a message router in front of the shards and the router handles persistent connections other than the usual technique of direct connection I&#x27;ve employed in the past.Contributed to an MMO game that involves waving light sabers around, another where you defeat the ultimate prime evil (though I was more on the fraud detection on that one), an unpublished MMO that unceremoniously died during the 2008 financial crash, a \"shared world\" game that involved animals, an open-world game that involves driving cars and running pedestrians over, a few \"internet scale\" websites, and am currently lead back-end on another MMO - though our database requirements are relatively simple this time around, but it is still again, read-at-start-up, write-only-when-necessary. reply doctorpangloss 12 hours agoparentLet&#x27;s say that among developers there was a history of how-to-implement gameplay traditions (like how to implement third person player movement, \"gameplay ability systems\", etc.) in programming languages besides C++. Like C# & Java, the memory managed friendly ones with good tooling. And let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re forbidden from reinventing C++ inside C# or Java, like Unity&#x27;s Burst does (so called HPC#). But you can \"do ECS,\" there are C# and Java ECS frameworks, that even use those languages respective arena allocation techniques well. You just aren&#x27;t allowed to reinvent C++, but you can use a high performance middleware that does, like Netty.Would you choose to author an MMO backend in one of those friendlier ecosystems?Do you think there&#x27;s value in having access to other Java applications, to embed as libraries of your grander \"in memory\" ideas? reply gabereiser 9 hours agorootparentOn the backend, you aren’t limited to sub 16ms frame rates and can use languages that provide more productivity vs performance. I have infinite cloud compute, but you only have 4ghz and 16gb ram.

This is a much worse problem in a metaverse system, because there are no static game level maps. Every object in the world is in a database somewhere.Second Life &#x2F; Open Simulator makes a big distinction between assets, inventories and area state. Assets (meshes, textures, animations, sounds) are immutable, and are stored more or less permanently. (There&#x27;s a garbage collection batch job that runs monthly or so) Those are basically files. There&#x27;s a vanilla web service running on an AWS web server, and Akamai, both heavily cached.Inventories are like file directories. They have asset UUIDs and some metadata (name, etc.) Those are in a database, but that data is dynamic and not cached. Each user has an inventory, of course, and it can be huge. 50,000 items are not unheard of. This is a metaverse; you can build stuff.Area state is in server memory for each region. That&#x27;s saved periodically, once a minute or so. This is a backup file, not a database. If you wanted a more continuous save process, you could keep a log of recent changes on a different machine than the server. After a crash, reload the server state and rerun the recent changes. Area state is under a gigabyte per region (A region is 256x256 meters).With a three level system like this, none of the levels are severely overloaded. The greatest data volume is from the asset store, and because that&#x27;s immutable, it can be and is cached extensively. There are three levels of caches - asset server, CDN, and client. It&#x27;s still a problem getting assets out to the clients fast enough, but with prioritization and concurrency, that&#x27;s solveable. The inventory database is mostly-read, so the usual scaling techniques for mostly-read databases work. Area state is in memory. The main trick is taking a clean backup without visibly freezing the system. reply gabereiser 9 hours agoprevOh I feel for the author. I’ve made games. I’ve made distributed web platforms. I have profound respect for modern mmo architectures because of one, nasty, “I wish this wasn’t a thing” class of data. State. Who, where, what animation, what modeled entity, is in my party, on my screen, under my axe. Synchronized playback of my swing to my party members so we all yell in excitement at the same time when the boss falls. This level of synchronization across shards (server clusters of servers) is enormously complex. Not to mention just writing “net code” in general. Network speed is the biggest issue and often TCP isn’t enough. You need network prediction. Where will they be based on position, direction, etc until I receive the next packet. I can then error check the prediction with the actual and correct. If UDP is available to you, you use it so you can deliver that state as fast as possible, with no ACK back and forth. A combination of UDP state transfer peer2peer for animation and basic state, TCP network connections for services and server state, REST for that auction house. SQS or pub&#x2F;sub for that item delivery and party&#x2F;match making&#x2F;world chat. It’s a beast of a problem.Rewind 15-20 years ago and all the folks who wanted to make a game, their first game, and they want to build an mmo. None of them succeeded. Not 1.

None of them succeeded. Not 1.I guess it depends on how you define success, but I would posit FOnline [1][2] as a success story. FOnline is a fan made MMO of Fallout by a single guy, using the assets of the original Fallout 1 & 2 single-player games. Having these assets and also general game mechanics already finished definitely played a huge role in getting it to a playable state in reasonable time. Still, FOnline is a from scratch code base not a mod of the originals. Also it changed plenty of mechanics too, most notably being real-time while the original games were turn-based.It&#x27;s still being pushed forward even today after 20 years of development by this one guy but it was playable in late 2000s already. Peak concurrent players that I remember seeing was a few thousand. Definitely not AAA level, but way past simple multiplayer. Would have gone higher due to the hype at the time, but the server started to really struggle at that point. After a few years of being a closed source free game it got converted into a SDK and spawned a dozen new fan games using that engine.Perhaps even more importantly, it was extremely fun in the early days. PvP gained you experience and all the other player&#x27;s loot. Later on the PvP was limited due to PvE lobbyists, but perhaps it made the game more fun for PvE lovers.Here&#x27;s a random screenshot from my personal archive that shows a bunch of players on the screen at once.

I wonder if you could just abuse redis for your game backend? reply justinlloyd 15 hours agoparentYou can use redis or memcached, but every MMO or online game I&#x27;ve been involved with, unless it was a \"web game\", has eschewed those for the most part. The game server maintains the state, knows all the objects in the universe, or at least its portion of the universe, and is responsible for retrieving and updating those objects. Even redis and memcached would be considered slow by comparison. Those game objects&#x2F;world objects&#x2F;MOBs may eventually be pushed out to a key-store server, but generally are not. The only portion of the database on any MMO I&#x27;ve worked on that has cared about \"proper indexes\" has been the area dealing with account retrieval. Traditional databases, at least on the non-web MMOs I&#x27;ve been involved with, when it comes to game state, are not normally used. RDBMS are used for boring things like account management, customer management, and so forth. Our database on the current (non-web) MMO uses a few more web technologies than I have in the past for this particular problem, but once the shard is loaded, and the user is connected, it is back to tradition, for the most part. reply machiaweliczny 10 hours agorootparentWhat protocols are used to stream updates to client?

Specifically keeping track of what are available for the character efficiently along with the event system to flag quests as completed, etc.There&#x27;s so many of them. I have to assume they&#x27;re spatially limited. You enter a zone, or an area, and the system loads up all of the quests located in that space, then it runs through to determine whether you qualify for them.As for quests that you&#x27;re on, that&#x27;s a bit more straightforward, since you&#x27;re so limited to how many you can carry around with you at any one time. Then, every event can practically just be brute forced across your pending quests to see which ones get progressed, etc.But it was always a curiosity to me considering the magnitude of the quests available how most anything can trigger quest progress.There&#x27;s also the whole achievement system, which perhaps is similar in design. reply genocidicbunny 14 hours agoparent> Specifically keeping track of what are available for the character efficiently along with the event system to flag quests as completed, etc.This is not necessarily that difficult, at least the first part. A lot of games will have quests be given out by a &#x27;quest giver&#x27; character of some sort, or they will activate at specific interaction points on the map. You can do some cheap &#x27;has-player-finished-quest&#x27; type of checks to determine if for example the quest giver has some sort of UI to indicate they have a quest available that activate when the quest giver first comes into view range. Quests with more initial conditions can hide their checks behind the interaction with the quest giver.Doing quest progression can be a bit more challenging. You need to determine when to do the checks for progress, and also how comprehensive you want them to be. The more complex the check, the less often you can run it without affecting game performance. I&#x27;ve seen designers use all sorts of tricks depending on the specific quest. Interaction volumes that run checks, periodic ticks, on entity flash messages..etc.> Then, every event can practically just be brute forced across your pending quests to see which ones get progressedThis only works for games that have a small number of active quests and not a lot of events.

(I say “we” but I’m just a system administrator who got to work with some cool people at Turbine.)As Eumenes notes, the Asheron’s Call engine was significantly ahead of its time with the seamless zoning. The cost was high, though — we needed quite a few servers to run a world, I think many more than our competitors. There are business reasons why we weren’t quite as cost-conscious as we perhaps should have been.The other factor involved in determining how often you persist is item duplication. If it’s possible to transfer an item between players without persisting state, and if there are known exploits that crash servers (not world, but individual servers), you wind up with an exploit that can duplicate items.

This is made possible thanks to dynamic load balancing, which is a scalable serverside architecture. The easiest way to appreciate the need for dynamic load balancing is to consider the following scenario.> Dynamic load balancing solves this overloaded server problem. Instead of assigning a static geographic area to each server, the individual servers can divide up the game world based on the relative processor load of each server. In the previous example, instead of remaining idle, all four servers would divide the load equally among themselves, ensuring the most efficient use of the hardware’s processing capacity. reply Animats 15 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a useful technology. Second Life &#x2F; Open Simulator do not have that, and need it. It&#x27;s good to hear about a success with that approach.Improbable tried that, dividing the world into regions but moving the region boundaries around based on player density. This worked, but apparently required huge amounts of inter-server traffic. The system was too expensive to operate. (Running it on Google Cloud with metering for every client&#x2F;server transaction didn&#x27;t help.) Five indy free to play games, some of them good (look up Worlds Adrift), went bust because of server cost.Improbable then pivoted to simulators for the UK military, a much less cost-sensitive market. That worked, but they had way too much company and funding for that niche. Then they tried to pivot to crypto metaverses, two years too late, and hooked up with the Yuga Labs (Bored Ape, Otherside) crowd. Lately, they&#x27;re trying to do something with US Major League Baseball. Their solution to the cost problem is to only run special events that last a few hours, for which they can short term rent some huge number of servers from AWS or somebody.There&#x27;s still no good off the shelf solution for this kind of scaling, with big worlds and big moving crowds.

    "originBody": "Encrypted Client Hello - the last puzzle piece to privacy 09/29/2023 Achiel van der Mandele Alessandro Ghedini Christopher Wood Rushil Mehra 5 min read Today we are excited to announce a contribution to improving privacy for everyone on the Internet. Encrypted Client Hello, a new proposed standard that prevents networks from snooping on which websites a user is visiting, is now available on all Cloudflare plans. Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is a successor to ESNI and masks the Server Name Indication (SNI) that is used to negotiate a TLS handshake. This means that whenever a user visits a website on Cloudflare that has ECH enabled, no one except for the user, Cloudflare, and the website owner will be able to determine which website was visited. Cloudflare is a big proponent of privacy for everyone and is excited about the prospects of bringing this technology to life. Browsing the Internet and your privacy Whenever you visit a website, your browser sends a request to a web server. The web server responds with content and the website starts loading in your browser. Way back in the early days of the Internet this happened in 'plain text', meaning that your browser would just send bits across the network that everyone could read: the corporate network you may be browsing from, the Internet Service Provider that offers you Internet connectivity and any network that the request traverses before it reaches the web server that hosts the website. Privacy advocates have long been concerned about how much information could be seen in \"plain text\": If any network between you and the web server can see your traffic, that means they can also see exactly what you are doing. If you are initiating a bank transfer any intermediary can see the destination and the amount of the transfer. So how to start making this data more private? To prevent eavesdropping, encryption was introduced in the form of SSL and later TLS. These are amazing protocols that safeguard not only your privacy but also ensure that no intermediary can tamper with any of the content you view or upload. But encryption only goes so far. While the actual content (which particular page on a website you're visiting and any information you upload) is encrypted and shielded from intermediaries, there are still ways to determine what a user is doing. For example, the DNS request to determine the address (IP) of the website you're visiting and the SNI are both common ways for intermediaries to track usage. Let's start with DNS. Whenever you visit a website, your operating system needs to know which IP address to connect to. This is done through a DNS request. DNS by default is unencrypted, meaning anyone can see which website you're asking about. To help users shield these requests from intermediaries, Cloudflare introduced DNS over HTTPS (DoH) in 2019. In 2020, we went one step further and introduced Oblivious DNS over HTTPS which prevents even Cloudflare from seeing which websites a user is asking about. That leaves SNI as the last unencrypted bit that intermediaries can use to determine which website you're visiting. After performing a DNS query, one of the first things a browser will do is perform a TLS handshake. The handshake constitutes several steps, including which cipher to use, which TLS version and which certificate will be used to verify the web server's identity. As part of this handshake, the browser will indicate the name of the server (website) that it intends to visit: the Server Name Indication. Due to the fact that the session is not encrypted yet, and the server doesn't know which certificate to use, the browser must transmit this information in plain text. Sending the SNI in plaintext means that any intermediary can view which website you’re visiting simply by checking the first packet for a connection: This means that despite the amazing efforts of TLS and DoH, which websites you’re visiting on the Internet still isn't truly private. Today, we are adding the final missing piece of the puzzle with ECH. With ECH, the browser performs a TLS handshake with Cloudflare, but not a customer-specific hostname. This means that although intermediaries will be able to see that you are visiting a website on Cloudflare, they will never be able to determine which one. How does ECH work? In order to explain how ECH works, it helps to first understand how TLS handshakes are performed. A TLS handshake starts with a ClientHello part, which allows a client to say which ciphers to use, which TLS version and most importantly, which server it's trying to visit (the SNI). With ECH, the ClientHello message part is split into two separate messages: an inner part and an outer part. The outer part contains the non-sensitive information such as which ciphers to use and the TLS version. It also includes an \"outer SNI\". The inner part is encrypted and contains an \"inner SNI\". The outer SNI is a common name that, in our case, represents that a user is trying to visit an encrypted website on Cloudflare. We chose cloudflare-ech.com as the SNI that all websites will share on Cloudflare. Because Cloudflare controls that domain we have the appropriate certificates to be able to negotiate a TLS handshake for that server name. The inner SNI contains the actual server name that the user is trying to visit. This is encrypted using a public key and can only be read by Cloudflare. Once the handshake completes the web page is loaded as normal, just like any other website loaded over TLS. In practice, this means that any intermediary that is trying to establish which website you’re visiting will simply see normal TLS handshakes with one caveat: any time you visit an ECH enabled website on Cloudflare the server name will look the same. Every TLS handshake will appear identical in that it looks like it's trying to load a website for cloudflare-ech.com, as opposed to the actual website. We've solved the last puzzle-piece in preserving privacy for users that don't like intermediaries seeing which websites they are visiting. For full details on the nitty-gritty of ECH technology, visit our introductory blog. The future of privacy We're excited about what this means for privacy on the Internet. Browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox are starting to ramp up support for ECH already. If you're a website, and you care about users visiting your website in a fashion that doesn't allow any intermediary to see what users are doing, enable ECH today on Cloudflare. We've enabled ECH for all free zones already. If you're an existing paying customer, just head on over to the Cloudflare dashboard and apply for the feature. We’ll be enabling this for everyone that signs up over the coming few weeks. Over time, we hope others will follow our footsteps, leading to a more private Internet for everyone. The more providers that offer ECH, the harder it becomes for anyone to listen in on what users are doing on the Internet. Heck, we might even solve privacy for good. If you're looking for more information on ECH, how it works and how to enable it head on over to our developer documentation on ECH. We protect entire corporate networks, help customers build Internet-scale applications efficiently, accelerate any website or Internet application, ward off DDoS attacks, keep hackers at bay, and can help you on your journey to Zero Trust.

    "commentBody": "Encrypted Client HelloHacker NewspastloginEncrypted Client Hello (cloudflare.com) 194 points by cosmosgenius 20 hours ago| hidepastfavorite173 comments supriyo-biswas 17 hours agoI see a lot of confusion here, probably Cloudflare should have included an explanation of how ECH works in TFA instead of referring to their other article[1].The difference between ECH and SNI is that while SNI includes the hostname in the ClientHello (the first TLS record indicating connection initiation), ECH includes an encrypted section in the ClientHello called ClientHelloInner, and the hostname is moved inside it.The ClientHelloInner is encrypted using a public key made available over DNS, which is queried over DNS over HTTPS providers such as Google or Cloudflare DNS; plaintext DNS is avoided in order to prevent a MITM on the ClientHelloInner key.Doing so prevents ISPs and governments from analyzing your traffic. However, a CDN operator such as Cloudflare terminates TLS for your website, and thus traffic would be visible to them either way.Now, to the non-technical part of it: while ECH provides a significant privacy improvement, I personally am against its implementation. Most ISPs enforce country-specific orders to block domains using a combination of DNS packet interception and SNI inspection. The legitimacy or sanity of such laws are a separate matter - countries would want to block websites that violate their laws.If we take away this last resort from governments, they would react by enforcing client side blocklisting and DRMization as suggested in France[2], or force root certificate installation using legislation[3], or blocking large swathes of the internet as is the case with China.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;encrypted-client-hello&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.article19.org&#x2F;resources&#x2F;france-proposed-internet...[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kazakhstan_man-in-the-middle_a... reply tialaramex 0 minutes agoparent> If we take away this last resort from governments, they would [...]Appeasement doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe it&#x27;s easier to remember that if you&#x27;re British and so you had to watch Chamberlain&#x27;s \"Peace for our time\" news reel in history class. The British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, negotiated a deal with rising star German Chancellor Adolf Hitler, you&#x27;ve heard of him. Hitler agreed that Germany wouldn&#x27;t start a massive European war in exchange for the British turning a blind eye to smaller wars he&#x27;d already started.You may never have heard of Chamberlain, because it turns out that piece of paper with Hitler&#x27;s signature on it was worth precisely what you&#x27;d expect, and we needed an actual War Prime Minister soon enough.Now, the argument for appeasement is that sure, it doesn&#x27;t actually work but it buys time. This is wrong because your opponents have the same extra time and they know precisely what they&#x27;re doing whereas you&#x27;re expending resources pretending (even if you correctly believe the appeasement won&#x27;t work) that appeasement works. reply ignoramous 8 hours agoparentprev> plaintext DNS is avoided in order to prevent a MITM on the ClientHelloInner key.Is MiTM possible unless the attacker is in possession of a sufficiently advanced quantum computer? What&#x27;s published as HTTPS&#x2F;SVCB record is the public part of the key. Afaik, DNSSEC isn&#x27;t even a requirement for zones publishing HTTPS&#x2F;SVCB ECH records?> Doing so prevents ISPs and governments from analyzing your traffic.Don&#x27;t think traffic analysis is thwarted. ECH plugs inspection of the only plaintext bits in TLS, which is not only abused by censors, but also by various &#x27;well-meaning&#x27; middleware that made bringing upgrades to TLSv1.3 a nightmare.> If we take away this last resort from governments...You mention GFW, and we got GFW without ECH. Governments will government, nothing will stop them. That shouldn&#x27;t stop us from shoring up our side of the equation. Because by that logic, Meta shouldn&#x27;t e2ee WhatsApp or Browsers shouldn&#x27;t OCSP &#x2F; CRL. In fact, not having those sound scary to me; because governments aren&#x27;t the only power hungry actor around. It wasn&#x27;t long ago Meta was caught spying on the users of its data saver VPN (Onavo) for half a decade, if not more. reply Groxx 6 hours agorootparentI think the remark is because: MITM would allow them to spoof the DNS response entirely, so they can replace it with whatever key they want. Doesn&#x27;t matter what level of security the key claims at that point, it&#x27;s attacker-controlled and they can just read whatever you send next. reply Obscurity4340 8 hours agorootparentprevCan someone chime in with how quantum computers effectively at least double the output of traditional \"classical\" computers? I legitimately don&#x27;t understand why its not easier and in some bottom-line sense cheaper just to like double up your (classical) computing power. What is it about QC that&#x27;s so damn sepcial when you could theoretically achieve the same maximal idealized output with a simple increase in classical inputs?It seems with QC, there&#x27;s this collective magical thinking that they offer this magical free lunch that is inaccessable via more traditional means.

Given an arbitrary (computable) function f: X -> Y, and a desired value y in the codomain, find a value x such f(x) = y. For the sake of simplicity, assume that x is unique (although a Grover&#x27;s algorithm can be extenef to not have this constraint).Let N be the size of the domain X. On a classical computer, without any additional information, the optimal solution is to simply iterate through X trying inputs until you find the correct one. On average you will need to evaluate f on half the possible inputs, which is N&#x2F;2. In the worst case, you need to try all N.Using Grover&#x27;s algorithm, you can solve the problem with only sqrt(N) invocations of f, which is a quadratic speed up compared with classical computers.Applying this to encryption keys: for a keylenth of n, we have 2^n possible keys. Classically speaking, you would need to try decrypting (2^n)&#x2F;2 = 2^(n-1) times. But with Grover&#x27;s algorithm, you can find the correct key after decrypting judt sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n&#x2F;2) times, which is the classical worst case for a key of half the length. Note that this is still exponential in the size of the key, so is not a fundamental game changer.This has nothing to do with prime factoring or the discrete log problem. Those have even better quantum algorithms (Shor&#x27;s) that can solve them in polynomial time, which would be a major game changer if they ever become practical. reply missingrib 7 hours agorootparentprevAlgorithms have been developed for quantum computers that could be potentially effective at breaking public key cryptosystems whose security relies on the difficulty of solving certain math problems on classical computers. In particular, the discrete logarithm problem and integer factorization of very large numbers: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Shor%27s_algorithm.There are no quantum computers large enough to even come close to attempting this, and there&#x27;s a question about whether it&#x27;s ever going to be physically possible to build a quantum computer large enough to actually attack something like a TLS key exchange in real time. Classical computers are equally as fast&#x2F;faster at other tasks. reply Obscurity4340 6 hours agorootparentIs it a fair conjecture that in some sense there&#x27;s an issue with cryptographer&#x27;s trying to push the field in terms of the efficacy and robustness of encryption forward while \"the government\"s continually work all manner of trickery to hamper these efforts in subtle and not-so-subtle but gag-ordered-enforced ways?I feel like there&#x27;s this constant ridiculous pushback on any digital product or protocol or service being air-tight cryptographically and implementationally speaking when they can basically already build air-tight cases via parallel construction with the help of the infinite resources available upon (often not even) receipt of a warrant?Its very strange. The obsession is always on completely neutering&#x2F;compromising the technology and never on actually doing the damn police work they are enpowered to approach laterally like they did before typewriters and telephones&#x2F;wire-taps or bending the providions of constitutions they swore to protect and enforce until its a simulacrum of its original concept.Like, it always comes across as they feel that their entire case is lost if they can only prove something 5 different ways instead of 6. It wouldn&#x27;t be so problematic if humans weren&#x27;t so human and law enforcement wasn&#x27;t emphatically staffed by humans who are liable to abuse things to maximize their money, power, and prestige and have the absolute or qualified immunity to get away with it at least once regardless of how it damages the targets of their misconduct. reply msm_ 7 hours agorootparentprev>Can someone chime in with how quantum computers effectively at least double the output of traditional \"classical\" computers?In general: Quantum computers halve the search space, not speed, so for example quantum computer needs 2^128 operations to bruteforce 2^256 keys [1]In case of non quantum resistant algorithms (for example RSA or most other popular algorithms today): there are algorithms that offer exponential speedup, where even a slow (in terms of number of operations&#x2F;second) quantum computer will easily outperform a classical comoputer[1]: Grover&#x27;s algorithm.

This in turn explains why CDNs like Cloudflare are interested in it. SNI allows CDNs to operate as intermediaries on a www where HTTPS is increasinglty mandatory for every website. With respect to the \"privacy\" of TLS it is peculiar to put ISPs and governments in one category and CDNs in another. If ISPs (without ECH) or CDNs (with or without ECH) are getting a list of every domain the user visits, then governments can get the same list by requesting it from the ISP or CDN.The question, IMHO, is whether there are other possible technical solutions besides TLS SNI to allow multiple HTTPS sites to be hosted on the same IP. Is it possible to obviate the need to use a third party such as a CDN to solve this problem. Is it possible to obviate the need for duct tape solutions like ECH. ECH is proposed as a solution for the \"plaintext domain names over the wire\" problem. But that problem only exists because it&#x27;s created by the use of SNI. And SNI exists to enable one to host multiple HTTPS sites on the same IP. Today, CDNs are the primary benefactors of SNI. They host 10s or 100s of 1000s of HTTPS sites on a limited number of IPs. These are the primary users and benefactors of SNI.For example, consider this prototype, which some believe inspired the advertising company-sposonsored \"QUIC\":https:&#x2F;&#x2F;curvecp.org&#x2F;addressing.html\"An ISP or site administrator can easily run a huge number of CurveCP servers on a single global IPv4 address, even if the servers are independently operated with separate long-term public keys. This feature is provided by a simple extension mechanism in CurveCP addresses.CurveCP servers are inherently anti-aliased, providing automatic virtual hosting and fixing some of the deficiencies in the \"same-origin\" policy in web browsers. This feature is provided by a simple domain-name mechanism in CurveCP addresses. If a site has two server addresses, and one server is down, a CurveCP client will quickly connect to the other address.A CurveCP connection remains fully functional even if the client changes IP address.CurveCP is fully compatible with existing NAT (network address translation) mechanisms; none of the above features require clients or servers to know the global addresses of their gateways.\" reply silverwind 13 hours agoparentprevWhy is DNS required to encrypt a TLS handshake? Why are there two SNIs in a ClientHello?ECH seems like a overengineered implementation when they could just have released TLS 1.4 which encrypts that section of the handshake. reply andrewaylett 12 hours agorootparentBootstrapping the encryption is a problem: until you&#x27;ve run the handshake, you don&#x27;t have a key with which you could encrypt the handshake. And you don&#x27;t want the key to live for too long, so folk are going to end up trying to use expired keys.Between the article and the linked introduction, all of what you are looking for is explained. reply tialaramex 10 hours agorootparentprevOther people already explained that there&#x27;s a bootstrap problem which prohibits \"just encrypt that section of the handshake\".But the two SNIs are because of GREASE particularly. They might be avoided if you didn&#x27;t want to enable GREASE, but we definitely want GREASE.The idea of GREASE is, whenever we might want to do something that&#x27;s visible to third parties, we must sometimes do it anyway, at least as much as they can tell, so as to ensure they tolerate this when it happens so that when we did want it we can do it successfully.For example GREASE extensions are just nonsense extensions you propose in a TLS connection today. Chrome does this. \"Hey server, can you do BINGLE BONGLE?\" and of course your server doesn&#x27;t do BINGLE BONGLE because that&#x27;s nonsense, but to a \"Security device\" which is \"Inspecting TLS connections as part of our Next Generation Firewall Technology\" it seems like maybe we want to do BINGLE BONGLE. How should it react? Well, it should do nothing because the specification is clear that if you don&#x27;t understand what is said you should ignore it, but without GREASE we know in SSL, and TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.1 these devices would freak out for each new extension.1.6GB of customer personal information in a CSV file POSTed to a competitor&#x27;s Dropbox? Fine. Your web browser wanted to use NEW FEATURE? Alert! Attack detected - lock down the network, summon armed guards! So hence the invention of GREASE.For ECH GREASE works by just always pretending we&#x27;re doing ECH. If we want to talk to old-web-site.example we send an outer SNI of old-web-site.example and it doesn&#x27;t matter what our inner SNI is, it can be random nonsense encrypted to nobody, because old-web-site don&#x27;t use ECH anyway.If we want to talk to ech-enabled-site.example our browser discovers oh, here&#x27;s a key for ECH for ech-enabled-site.example and it says we should ask to talk to boring.example, so the browser encrypts the inner SNI of ech-enabled-site.example with the key, and provides an outer SNI of boring.example.In both cases this looks the same to snoops, there&#x27;s an outer SNI they can read and an inner SNI they can&#x27;t read. Which is genuine? No way for them to know. But the server knows easily. reply stefan_ 12 hours agorootparentprevHow do you \"just encrypt it\"? Encryption in TLS starts after you have verified who you are talking to via the certificate, otherwise you might just be doing encryption with whoever happens to MITM you. However to do the verification, the server must know what domain you are actually trying to reach - hence the SNI. This is why there is the DNS side channel. reply politelemon 20 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not seeing it. It looks contradictory what they&#x27;re saying.> This means that whenever a user visits a website on Cloudflare that has ECH enabled, no one except for the user and the website will be able to determine which website was visited.But if you look at the inner&#x2F;outer SNI part:> The outer SNI is a common name that, in our case, represents that a user is trying to visit an encrypted website on Cloudflare. We chose cloudflare-ech.com as the SNI that all websites will share on Cloudflare. Because Cloudflare controls that domain we have the appropriate certificates to be able to negotiate a TLS handshake for that server name.> The inner SNI contains the actual server name that the user is trying to visit. This is encrypted using a public key and can only be read by Cloudflare. Once the handshake completes the web page is loaded as normal, just like any other website loaded over TLS.So Cloudflare sees it? That&#x27;s definitely not the same as what they&#x27;re describing, it&#x27;s more of a wink-wink Applesque \"trust me bro\" style of \"privacy\" - a consolidation of traffic under the pretext of something else.I also looked at the draft document they linked, and that seems to match up with what I&#x27;m understanding.> If ECHClientHello.type is outer, then the server acts as a client- facing server and proceeds as described in Section 7.1 to extract a ClientHelloInner, if available. reply TrueDuality 19 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re absolutely right, Cloudflare will still see it. That doesn&#x27;t make this a bad improvement though. You don&#x27;t have to use Cloudflare to support it, but it helps obscure which site is being visited by the nature of Cloudflare hosting so many different sites.So what does this actually protect against? Who will this benefit? Mostly people in censored countries and companies. This removes the last piece of information that can be used to block HTTPS traffic based on the site your visiting without being a party to the exchange.I still think DoH is hot garbage and the way it has been implemented across browsers is an atrocity. It&#x27;s actively harmful to security even if the spirit is in the right place. I&#x27;ve got no complaints about ECH. reply YeBanKo 12 hours agorootparent> I still think DoH is hot garbage and the way it has been implemented across browsers is an atrocity.Not sure if it&#x27;s a hot garbage, but I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s better than DoT or DoQ, except maybe a use case for censored countries. DoT is faster and can be abstracted away from from HTTP. Presumably, DoH is more privacy preserving, because it runs on the same port and looks just like the rest HTTPS traffic.

However during the past decade and a half we&#x27;ve seen a massive change. We find ourselves in a situation where only https matters. It&#x27;s a catch 22 type of situation, where anything else better be able to tunnel over it, otherwise many users will be left out since it&#x27;s all that is supported, because it&#x27;s what others tunnel over.While this happened, the browser organizations grew politically strong and now controls not only the public key infrastructure that underpins https but also standardization of https itself.The only exception to this is dns. Together with ip itself it follows the open meritocratic process that gave us decentralised planet wide internetworking. Unfortunately, it is closely tied with the domain name system, which is controlled by a parallel organization which isn&#x27;t as open and meritocratic.So basically we have three stakeholders of political value in the Internet ecosystem today. Us proponents of open and permissionless internetworks closely align with one, one is a gray area, and one is a conglomerate of private companies.It is really healthy for the Internet if Mozilla, Microsoft and Cloudflare took control over dns resolving on a wide scale? Even apart from the obvious privacy issues?They may mean well, but it logically follows that when dns is centralized among a few actors, they also will have an unproportionally large say in the evolution of the system. They could even tack on some extra top domains or other extensions that they could resolve. All in good faith of course. But that would, in time, bring over any remaining users of the old decentralized system.It&#x27;s not as if similar things hasn&#x27;t happened before, in other contexts. So, yes, I will be one of the holdouts and keep resolving my own dns queries. It&#x27;s not harder than \"apt-get install unbound\".

What you don&#x27;t need is for it to be implemented in the way DoH commonly does it.What you should have is a router, which hands itself out as the DNS server via DHCP, takes the client&#x27;s plaintext DNS request and does an encrypted query -- ideally directly to the authoritative servers for that domain, but at least to something of your choosing. Or, you configure your device to do this itself for every application using the system DNS. These all work fine, because the device owner can reasonably change them -- you configure it in one place for every application or your whole LAN at once.The problem with DoH is that it puts it into each individual application, and then its infeasible for the device owner to change it because it&#x27;s a million settings in a million places and some applications don&#x27;t support changing it at all. Worse, you get evil applications where the endpoint device is the thing controlled by Evil Corp and the local network is the thing the device owner is using to block spyware. At which point \"the network\" needs to be able to block this or malware and evil IoS garbage can operate with impunity.The claimed workaround is that browsers try to resolve a particular name with the system DNS and then turn of DoH if it resolves in a particular way, but now you&#x27;re back to this:> It&#x27;s a case of \"can&#x27;t, because even if you change the setting, $evil_isp will hijack the queries anyway\".Because then $evil_isp can just resolve that name in that way to go back to doing the MITM.

There are many, many better ways to deal with evil ISPs.Encouraging the world to send all of their DNS lookups to a centralized entity like Cloudflare (who, by every right, are precisely in a position to be an evil ISP) is such an incredibly shortsighted idea that I have to think that you haven&#x27;t thought out the implications of a world where DoH is dominant.If you care to learn, consider things without DoH: you can edit your hosts file. You can choose your DNS servers. You can run a local recursive resolving DNS server. You can block ads and advertisingware using your DNS server and&#x2F;or something like Pihole. You can block all DNS queries to the outside world on your network so that they all go through your own resolvers.Next, consider a world where DoH is commonplace: you have no control over DNS lookups on your own system. Your only choice is to not run binaries that might do things you don&#x27;t like. Want to block ads or adware, or adult sites, or conspiracy sites, or any of a number of other things on the Windows system that your child uses? Now Edge doesn&#x27;t let you. Want to block the Trojans and phishing sites that Google serves through their ad network? Chrome doesn&#x27;t let you. \"Just don&#x27;t run binaries that do that\" is one heck of an ask for people who don&#x27;t know how to set their own DNS or who have an evil ISP.You can block common DoH servers, until Cloudflare puts them on the same address as the endpoints for their millions of hosting customers. But what happens when apps do DoH lookups using random Amazon AWS or Google Cloud servers? How do you block them? Do you block ALL https?You see, you&#x27;d give up freedom, and have everyone else give up their freedom, for some abstract \"safety\" from ISPs that use your DNS data. You&#x27;d apply a shitty fix for 1% of the people to 100% of the people, rather than create tools for the 1% to circumvent their evil ISPs.The fact that you&#x27;d choose this makes me think that either you want big, evil companies like Cloudflare to win, or you really don&#x27;t understand the issues.Just like this article above does a good job explaining the lack of security in the cloud, we really could use a good article explaining how completely inane the idea of DoH is. reply Avamander 16 hours agorootparent> but what happens when applications and Trojans start doing DoH lookups, skipping our system&#x27;s configured DNS?Exfiltration has always been a problem.

Cloudflare might not be going for the low hanging fruit such as injecting ads, but they clearly want to be a monopoly around whom the Internet recentralizes.Moving DNS from an ISP, who we pay and with whom we have legal contracts, to a company that does things, supposedly, for altruistic reasons, with whom we do NOT have contracts, doesn&#x27;t fix anything. It makes things worse. The solution is to remove DNS from your ISP and run it yourself, or use a not-for-profit that isn&#x27;t trying to become a monopoly, that isn&#x27;t in a position to have its data syphoned off by the NSA, that doesn&#x27;t knowingly and willingly host spammers, phishers and scammers.How about we don&#x27;t trust ISPs AND we don&#x27;t trust Cloudflare?BTW - I have to flatly disagree with your suggestion that, \"once you&#x27;ve got one MITM it becomes harder to trust that there isn&#x27;t a second one\". That&#x27;s ridiculous. I can check and verify things to a much greater degree by running my own network. Also, I never said anything about MITM my own network. I want to run my own DNS and block DNS to the rest of the Internet. That&#x27;s not MITM.The least wrong thing is to not replace something that MIGHT be shitty with something that MIGHT also be shitty, but might also open you to new problems and security issues. The idea that it MIGHT be less shitty isn&#x27;t a good enough reason for DoH. reply josephcsible 10 hours agorootparent> The solution is to remove DNS from your ISP and run it yourselfThis doesn&#x27;t work because if you run your own recursive DNS server, it will make insecure requests to all of the authoritative servers, and so your ISP can hijack them all.

The existing solutions for doing this by examining SNI are already often bypassable by forging the SNI (looking at you, AWS Network Firewall). reply LinuxBender 12 hours agoparentCF explain how to do this here [1]. Have your local DNS resolvers filter the HTTPS type of DNS queries on your DNS servers. One example from Microsoft [2]. Unbound would probably need a patch though a work-around could be an iptables string filter or u32 filter for the record type. There is a DNS module [3] for iptables but it is not part of any default installations AFAIK.The second way is to return a “no error no answer” or an NXDOMAIN response to queries made to the use-application-dns.net.I personally already use the second option to block DoH and cell phones seem to automatically figure out to use port 853 for DNS-Over-TLS on my home router Unbound DNS. I also null route most of the public DoH servers. People point out that DoH can be on any CDN IP but it never has been.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.cloudflare.com&#x2F;ssl&#x2F;edge-certificates&#x2F;ech&#x2F;[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows-server&#x2F;networking&#x2F;...[3] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mimuret&#x2F;iptables-ext-dns reply bscphil 11 hours agorootparentThis only works because browser vendors have taken the totally bullshit approach of \"you&#x27;re only allowed to use ECH if you have DoH enabled\", even though they&#x27;re really unrelated technologies. Related Mozilla bug: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.mozilla.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=1500289Of course this kind of filtering is useless to stop a determined user (in a bring-your-own-device environment) because they can trivially just run their own DoH endpoint. reply josephcsible 10 hours agorootparentprev> The second way is to return a “no error no answer” or an NXDOMAIN response to queries made to the use-application-dns.net.This misfeature can&#x27;t be removed from browsers soon enough.

Browsers are free to ignore (and I think Firefox has a toggle to ignore it). reply LinuxBender 6 hours agorootparentprevThat DNS module for IPTables actually looks to be a bit outdated and is missing the type HTTPS as far as I can tell so maybe a request to the people at nlnetlabs to add options for query types to block in Unbound DNS may be useful. reply josephcsible 15 hours agoparentprevYou&#x27;re supposed to do that kind of filtering on the endpoint. If it&#x27;s possible anywhere else, then it could be used to censor other people&#x27;s computers. reply folmar 11 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m afraid you only take into account private use.On-endpoint filtering is not enough on a large scale. In a network with expected high level of security I don&#x27;t trust the endpoint and censoring them is a feature, there is no moral or legal expectation of privacy, but data integrity would be nice. reply josephcsible 10 hours agorootparentIf you own all of the endpoints, then it is indeed morally okay for you to do network-level filtering. The problem is that if we design network protocols so it&#x27;s possible for you to do that, then it will also be possible for people to do network-level filtering that affects endpoints they don&#x27;t own. reply jbombadil 11 hours agorootparentprevI see your point, but on my network I want that ability.I want to have my tv connect to YouTube, but not phone Sony&#x2F;Samsung&#x2F;whoever.I want to be able to setup a pihole to block adds independently of the browser&#x2F;device being used. reply josephcsible 10 hours agorootparentHow do you propose that it be possible for you to do that to things like your smart TV without it being possible for you to do that to other people&#x27;s computers? reply jeroenhd 5 hours agoparentprevIf you&#x27;re doing any SNI filtering, you can validate the SNI with the certificate passed in the ServerHello (which most tools skip, because that&#x27;s computationally expensive in comparison). This involves reconstructing message streams as well, of course. You&#x27;ll also need to figure out how to deal with 1RTT (probably block it).I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much more of a pain than it already was. You can disable the feature on your side if you don&#x27;t want it, and block+log any traffic with ECH enabled. Hell, you can set up an intercepting proxy with your own CA if you want. That way, nothing gets out without at least getting logged.Of course this becomes quite difficult if you don&#x27;t own the devices you&#x27;re monitoring, but that is kind of the point behind TLS&#x2F;ODoH&#x2F;ECH. reply yardstick 6 hours agoprev> The outer SNI is a common name that, in our case, represents that a user is trying to visit an encrypted website on Cloudflare. We chose cloudflare-ech.com as the SNI that all websites will share on Cloudflare. Because Cloudflare controls that domain we have the appropriate certificates to be able to negotiate a TLS handshake for that server name.All this really means is operators that inspect SNI will now just block cloudflare-ech.com.It’s a tug-o-war between cloud flare and the ISPs and network admins, essentially. reply profmonocle 5 hours agoparentIf I&#x27;m reading this right, blocking this would result in a denial of service rather than a security downgrade. And Cloudflare is so large that blocking all of its hosted sites would effectively look like a partial internet outage. That might not bother state actors, but any ISP in a free country that willingly did this would be so overwhelmed by customer service requests that it wouldn&#x27;t be worth it.Any legitimate network operator who wants to avoid this for securiity reasons (i.e. for corporate managed devices) can just disable it by policy, assuming they aren&#x27;t already using a decrypting TLS proxy.Plus, there&#x27;s an easier loophole than blocking ECH - block encrypted DNS. AFAIK most DNS over HTTPS&#x2F;TLS implementations fall back to plaintext DNS if they can&#x27;t make an encrypted connection. ECH&#x27;s reliance on DNS privacy is its weak point; one that can&#x27;t really be avoided right now. reply jeroenhd 4 hours agorootparentIn many cases you don&#x27;t even need to block DoH. Many implementations (Chrome&#x2F;Edge&#x2F;I believe Windows itself) will try to use the ISPs DoH servers by default if available, and switch to an alternative if the user chooses to do so.Because very few websites bother to implement things like DNSSEC (and even fewer clients bother to validate it), the ISP DNS server can then fake all the ECH data it wants, reply dilyevsky 19 hours agoprevIt seems like the same result could easily be achieved by widespread Domain Fronting support (e.g set sni to cloudflare-sekrit.com and Host: header to the actual domain). Can someone explain why this wasn&#x27;t adopted more widely (I know CF, for example, disabled theirs)? reply andrewaylett 11 hours agoparentThat relies on the user knowing that they can trust the certificate they use as the front in lieu of the certificate for the domain they actually want. Which is sub-optimal from a security point of view -- unless you complete a handshake with a valid certificate for the domain you&#x27;re actually visiting, how do you know that the server you&#x27;re talking to actually has a valid certificate?In ECH, we still only complete one handshake per session. If you&#x27;ve got the right key for the inner client hello, you&#x27;ll complete a handshake with the certificate for the domain you&#x27;re trying to visit. If not, you&#x27;ll complete a handshake with a certificate for the domain in the outer hello and the server will send you the correct key so you can try again with a new session. The client gets to validate the right certificate. reply dilyevsky 9 hours agorootparentThis explanation makes sense, thanks!

Game Merch Blog Support Friday Facts #378 - Trains on another level Posted by V453000 on 2023-09-29 Hello! The code refactor of rails presented last week is great, but the motivation for such a task wasn't quite just some shape changes for rails. As explained last week, we can now define any kind of rail shape, and we had some very specific shapes in mind all along... Over or under? We want multi-level crossings for trains, but how? Bridges or tunnels? At first it would seem like going underground is the safer bet - we already have experience with belts and pipes doing that. Simple - we draw the entrance and the exit, the middle is magically connected, and that's it? The second layer of rails should also be able to use curves and rail signals, otherwise it would be quite limited. Sometimes you already want to interact with items inside of underground belts, with trains this would be a lot worse as they can run out of fuel, stop at signals etc. Building curves, signals or interacting with trains inside of a tunnel probably means we need to be able to walk inside. If we can walk in a tunnel, biters and robots should be able to as well. If tunnels can have curves, how could you tell which tunnel entrance connects to which exit when looking from the outside? Tunnels \"over\" water don't quite feel right. Drawing tunnels would be surprisingly difficult as we would need to do some expensive masking that Factorio isn't currently capable of. And more... The idea of an elevated rail seems to have much more potential, although drawing in an upper layer certainly won't be easy either. Also, you just want to boldly see all of your trains in their full glory instead of hiding them somewhere in a cellar! Such an idea would consist of: Rail ramp - The transition between the lower and upper layer. Elevated rail - Tracks buildable above most things. Rail support - Elevated rails would need supports at some intervals. Elevated rail system pieces. These were the \"greybox\" graphics to test the gameplay of the new rail shapes and the ramps, before the final graphics were created. Elevated rails I know you've already scrolled down to see the ramps instead of reading this but it just felt weird not to put a paragraph here. When we thought about the visual design with Albert and Earendel, we wanted the ramp to be heavy and industrial, but at the same time not quite perfectly stable and rigid. After multiple iterations we have arrived to this combination of a solid concrete base combined with an upper metal structure. The concrete base helps clearly show where the ramp touches the ground, while in contrast the metal part has a lot of holes so you could see entities placed behind the ramp most of the time. The metal is painted red, as mostly the only other red entities in Factorio are related to trains, it helps the elevated rails belong to the train family, and stand out in the factory - as they should with their height. The rail ramp is the new longest entity in the game at 16 tiles long and 4 tiles wide, so you will need to consider where and when to place it. It can only rotate in 4 directions. The rail support follows the style of the ramp, but with the difference that it can be rotated in 8 directions. It has a roughly 4x4 collision box, with the rotated ones all having the same shape. The elevated rails can be built between ramps, held by rail supports along the way. The elevated rail can be constructed above anything except tall entities (rocket silo, roboport, big electric pole, etc.). They have exactly the same rail shapes as the new ground rails do, and signals can be attached to the elevated rails. There are fences which help visually distinguish the elevated rails from ground rails, you can also see how they disappear on track crossings. In practice replacing a colliding connection inside of a T junction with a ramp going around it can already help a lot. With the ramp being long and since we have \"only\" two layers, building a fully multilevel junction can get rather large, but the throughput potential is massive. It's worth noting that it's not just the level separation that helps. It's also the fact that we don't need chain signals, so we can shorten the distance between normal rail signals a lot as we don't need to guarantee there's enough space for a train \"behind the junction\". Specifically in arrays of train stops, having the exit and entrance on different levels is a game changer. JuxtaposeJS There is a very special patch that draws under terrain which is visible only in places where the ramps or supports touch water. In case you decide to route your rails through a lake because why not, islands can become opportunities for multi-level crossings. Building something elevated can be done with the rail planner. Either you can press a keyboard shortcut to switch the destination layer or you can start the rail planner on a ramp, rail support, or an elevated rail. But one day, kovarex said \"Why doesn't the rail planner just snap to the rail you're pointing at?\" And since that day it does, rail planner \"just connects\" to any rail you pick, including between ground and elevated levels. This also massively helps mitigate issues related to the rail planner having more directions. The rail planner can often find connections you wouldn't even expect to be possible, which can be mesmerizing to play with... ...as a result, this can happen a lot quicker than you'd think. Conclusion Allowing trains to cross paths on different levels has been one of the most requested features for a very long time. We had always felt it makes perfect sense, but trains in Factorio would rarely ever get into serious enough throughput issues to justify adding elevated rails. The expansion changed this landscape quite a bit though. If we expect players to generally build larger factories than in the base game, train throughput could become an issue, and since you are expected to travel away from the home planet, having a train system that doesn't deadlock would be more important than ever before. It's not hard to guess that implementing this would require a lot of time, and working on the expansion behind closed doors allowed us some breathing room where we could make bigger experiments. Between boskid with the mechanics and posila with the drawing code, just the programming took a few months. On the graphics side, we could reuse a lot of initial Blender setup from the rework of ground rails, but that didn't get us very far. The ramps were simply large objects, while the rail supports are a hive of optical hacks as they need to fill their collision boxes. Both the ramps and supports were reworked multiple times to finally get the result that would look and function well. Especially because of the elevated rail fences, the required sprite count grew very rapidly. This made me use all the tricks in our Blender book and even add completely new Blender Python tools that mostly help with organizing and rendering large amounts of outputs. I got the final iteration to about 90% completion but then it just became too much. Jerzy already had experience with rail graphics, so I had asked him to help me by finishing the last details and texturing, and then he handled all of the signals and remnants again. It's hard to overstate how much bravery and mental fortitude was required to \"just\" jump into the Blend file of the elevated rails, and I'd like to thank him for that, again. You can probably see from the above images that he did excellently. :) Between Earendel on concept art, me on most of the 3D process, Jerzy on finishing and together with Albert on re-evaluating multiple major iterarions, the graphics took about 9 months to make. Perhaps we could have taken some simplified route trying to make tunnels work, but we believe the elevated rails offer better gameplay beyond comparison. Yet again we can confidently say that properly focusing on some features in the expansion rather than trying to shove more things into 1.0 was a very good decision. All of the elevated rails will be only available with the expansion executable. Their technology can be researched using Production science packs without the need to go to space or any planets. Elevated rails be will one of the standalone official mods next to Quality and Space Age, so you can play a vanilla-like game with just the elevated rails for example, or other mods can just depend on Elevated rails. As always, we are looking forward to all the feedback you are about to elevate.

I want to play up the strength and what makes our game unique & special.Plus as an indie the biggest hurdle is \"getting a chance to say something\" not \"what to say\". As players give attention to what is popular, and any attention small devs like us get need to be focused on why our game should exist at all. reply valyagolev 9 hours agoparentprevmaybe a different way to frame it is that your inspiration idols are releasing brilliant new work, and your tribute to them manages to be relevant ;-)I&#x27;m not such a crazy fanboy as that sentence should make me seem, but factorio has definitely made the management&#x2F;building genre much more interesting for me, and while i never have a patience for a megafactory, i do enjoy the other games inspired by factorio, and will likely try yours reply Danieru 7 hours agorootparentThanks eh. Certainly Factorio was a major inspiration, along with Railroad Tycoon and Transport Tycoon. Personally I wanted to concrate the fun I experienced when building new factories in Factorio. The clean slate and excitement of getting everything working together. Hence our mission structured campaign. We tried to make each mission challenge the player to build slightly different that the last time. Sort of like if Factorio had more ways to \"start\" than just coal, copper plates, and iron. reply Aeolun 9 hours agoparentprevYour special sauce is now ‘unlimited’ train levels. reply Danieru 7 hours agorootparentWell lol, we&#x27;re not actually unlimited. Over the campaign players unlock new tech which caps out at 10 levels high. With each track requiring 2 levels of clearance. So the max layering is 5 tracks deep. Until mods...It helps that our game is 3d so you can rotate the camera to see things below at different angles. With Factorio being 2d they&#x27;d have a horrible visibility problem going even 3 layers up. reply infogulch 4 hours agorootparentOh there&#x27;sI&#x27;m resisting buying the full game because I know exactly how it&#x27;d end.It won&#x27;t end, thats the problem reply distract8901 11 hours agorootparentprevI played one map for 700 hours over the span of a full year.This game does something terrible to my brain reply bombcar 10 hours agorootparentBesides modded factorio the only thing that comes close is gregtech new horizons reply seaal 1 hour agorootparentAfter being hesitant to try GTNH for the longest time, I finally decided to give it a go about a week ago.I’m hooked and honestly surprised at how smooth it’s running with the Java 20 support on such an old version of Minecraft.10&#x2F;10 would recommend. reply Macha 8 hours agorootparentprevFitting, given industrialcraft and buildcraft and probably gregtech 2 were inspirations for Factorio. In a lot of ways, Factorio helped me appreciate what old Gregtech was trying to do, but the formula stuck in factorio because it omitted the manual mining aspect. Gregtech was always a bit tedious to encourage you to automate, but it was too slow starting that portion off as it had to give a nod to the base game of minecraft. Factorio basically cuts that out except for the very first 3 minutes of a new playthrough. reply bombcar 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve played a number of modpacks for Minecraft and some are way too primitive (anything involving primitive tech or whatever it is), and at some point you really do have to stop manually mining (which GTNH has well, eventually reaching void miners, where the real problem is power not minerals).Factorio is more of a throughput optimizer as it really doesn&#x27;t have that much in the way of tech, and nothing really becomes outdated beyond a few early game items. reply danielheath 9 hours agorootparentprevMindustry is close, for me. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentMindustry is certainly fun, but it doesn’t come anywhere near the complexity levels of a large Factorio factory. reply pests 9 hours agorootparentprevMindustry has a certain elegance to it and also the multiplayer aspect is really cool. Griefing can cause a lot of issues though unless they solved that since I played a few years ago - a single misplaced ore will clog a line and its easy for someone to silently sabotage. replykleene_op 9 hours agoprevNice try, but a friend of mine told me this game is digital crack.I&#x27;m not gonna get hooked on this until I&#x27;m retired. reply jmorenoamor 6 hours agoparentFactorio completely hacks and breaks the brain&#x27;s reward system of anyone interested in problem solving. It&#x27;s a never ending, deep, wide, and task oriented rabbit hole where you can create very personal solutions that are very rewarding.And the scale is massive, from simple obvious problems at the start, to huge, factory wide ones that emerge from the solutions you implemented before, that require carefully planing and phased execution to avoid breaking things.And then you discover the circuit network, and the complexity of the solution space available to you suddenly becomes exponential. reply Macha 10 hours agoprevGameplay wise: Great, I&#x27;m looking forward to it. I think they&#x27;ve come to just the right level of flexibility to not make people just automatically make everything elevated without having to just make it tediously expensive.Graphics wise, I think it&#x27;s mostly working, but, and it feels bad to say this with the 9 months they&#x27;ve apparently spent on it, I think some of the sprites are not clearly elevated enough? Like the X crossing in the second has my brain really want to see it as ground level rails, and similiarly there&#x27;s a second about two thirds across and one third down on the final image which doesn&#x27;t read as elevated to me.I think in the X at least they&#x27;ve had to make some balance between visual noise and how supported it looks, since the support rails terminate early rather than joining each other at angles, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not easy to do. reply jcranmer 9 hours agoparentI also agree that there&#x27;s something off in the graphics department. Although looking across all the images, it&#x27;s only in the diamond crossing that the illusion is horribly broken. The railings are mostly doing a good job of differentiating between the height levels, but if a junction is complex enough that the railings disappear for a significant portion of it, the differentiation is lost.OTOH, the diamond junction is an incredibly zoomed-in shot, so maybe we&#x27;re overestimating from one picture the size of the portion without railings. reply vavooom 5 hours agoprevThis elevates the game in a whole new way!!! Haha have to make this comment as I am just in continuous awe by Factorio and its developers. reply keketi 11 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s happening. This is the most significant event of the decade. reply PeterStuer 5 hours agoprevAs a kid I was realy into model trains. But the reality was&#x2F;is that it is way too expensive for my budget. What is the most close digital alternative to model railway enjoyment? Most of the games I have seen don&#x27;t seem to capture it. reply k8sToGo 4 hours agoparentI believe it is this one: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;store.steampowered.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;957080&#x2F;EEP_15&#x2F; reply pixl97 11 hours agoprevSpaghetti, now in even more dimensions. reply hcnews 11 hours agoprevThis has to be the biggest thing in Factorio since sliced bread.

Than the release arrived and I gave up playing having to scout the map just to find an ore field.That is the premise to playing, but it&#x27;s why I found minecraft a bore. Same with any survival game. reply solardev 9 hours agoparentYou can make a game with custom settings and increase both the frequency and size&#x2F;depth of ore fields, which makes that a lot less frustrating. There&#x27;s still plenty to build even if you deemphasize the exploration portion (which wasn&#x27;t my favorite either). reply wildrhythms 9 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s also a number of infinite resource mods. I know Dyson Space Sphere and some other similar games offer those options built in . reply vermilingua 3 hours agorootparentMaxing richness in world gen is all-but-infinite; but regardless infinite ore just moves the throughput bottleneck much earlier as you no longer have the incentive to distribute your ore supply. reply burnished 9 hours agoparentprevIts been a while since I last played but there was very little minecraft style ore searching and that was on a railworld setup, which has fewer but richer ore patches. Part of that may have been the radars I put down whenever I placed defensive turrets, not only do they scan the map for you but they give you mapsight (when you zoom in enough it stops being a symbolic representation and starts being game graphics). Its very helpful for telling if a biter attack is serious or referencing a layout on the other side of your factory that you want to repeat, and I think its nicer that the map scanning occurs almost as a side effect of that immediate tangible benefit.You can also muck with the world generation and make patches much richer and much more frequent. And I don&#x27;t mean that like &#x27;you can turn the difficulty down&#x27;, its really more like increasing or decreasing emphasis on an aspect of the game to suit your preferences.I have felt what you express about minecraft so I wanted to chip in my 2c, because it would be a shame if you missed out on factorio due to weird mapgen or the like. reply wildrhythms 9 hours agoparentprevSame, but for a different reason: I tend to get a bit frustrated knowing there is an &#x27;optimal&#x27; way to build certain layouts, and the min-max part of my brain takes over and I spend more time looking up those layouts than actually enjoying figuring it out for myself. reply Aeolun 9 hours agorootparentI made it all myself only to find out that a 64 by 64 layout (exactly 2 chunks) is just barely not possible. Or at least, constant deadlock heaven. reply falcolas 10 hours agoparentprev [–] Radars are your friend for exploring the map. Cheap, and they even have late game value when you’re placing things for base bots. reply danielheath 9 hours agorootparent [–] The energy cost to run more than a few is prohibitive though. I prefer to research cars and then go driving, but that’s a very different sort of gameplay (eg twitchy rapid steering to avoid collisions at speed) reply mdavidn 5 hours agorootparentRadars do consume a lot of energy at the beginning of a game, but even just one placed early and running continuously will find the ore needed to produce exponentially more power.After that, I no longer think about radar power consumption. I just place them willy-nilly wherever they&#x27;ll be useful. They&#x27;re even spaced throughout my factory&#x27;s interior just so I can see it working on the map from anywhere. reply infogulch 4 hours agorootparentprev [–] Are they too energy prohibitive, or do you have too few steam turbines? I think we all know what the right answer is here. ;) reply m463 2 hours agorootparent [–] Couldn&#x27;t you just run them off a closed solar setup? reply Applications are open for YC Winter 2024 GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

Backstory Insomnium is a fork of Kong/Insomnia at 2023.5.8, the last commit before compulsory account login was introduced. In a sense, Insomnium is a community response to the latest product update that forces account creation w/o warning. I was among the users who were deeply affected by the recent change. I still think Insomnia is a nice product in general, but I have to disagree with the direction it is going. So I have decided to fork it and make it 100% local and privacy-focus. Roadmap I have removed user login, tracking, analytics, etc, from Insomnia so it is now a 100% local app. I will be cleaning up the code to make the UI faster, and refactor the local database and config to keep everything lean. If you have any feature request or encountered any bug, feel free to open an issue. Thanks! I'm also working on a Code Llama plugin for Insomnium to make it more easily customizable and extensible, while keeping the core product fast and 100% local.

I plan to maintain it long-term! I will be rolling out some feature improvements and updates these few weeks.I still think Kong did a good job in crafting the product. I started using Insomnia in my previous company 3 years ago and our team loved it.What happened recently felt a little bit like the Unity fiasco (of course, in a much much smaller scale). Though as a user I would say Kong had taken a bad turn, as a dev I&#x27;m still grateful to them for open-sourcing such a fantastic product.One of the reasons I forked Insomnia was because it uses React & Electron, both of which I&#x27;m quite familiar with. And I think many parts of Insomnia are quite nicely written overall (but unfortunately things like nedb that was used is no longer maintained https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;louischatriot&#x2F;nedb so it&#x27;s probably wise to swap out at some point) reply graphememes 12 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;hoppscotch.io&#x2F; is another one reply ushakov 12 hours agorootparentIt’s VC-funded… reply SparkyMcUnicorn 12 hours agorootparentI think their model is acceptable and sustainable.

See the thread that dang posted here. The CTO&#x27;s own words make it quite clear that he sees the Insomnia community as pests getting in the way of his IPO.It should be crystal clear to everyone paying attention that the leadership at Kong doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of respect for their user&#x27;s private data. I was hoping they&#x27;d take a moment to reflect after the extreme backlash but instead they&#x27;ve just been arguing with users nonstop while some of us are sitting here filling out compliance reports on the accidentally exfiltrated data. reply user6275726E 12 hours agoparentperhaps more heartbreaking is a tweet from the original creator of Insomnia[1] (who sold it to Kong some years ago) which reminds me of the time a year ago when Insomnia forced the GitHub stars count to be prominently placed in the product, but explicitly without any way to disable it[2].

    "originBody": "SKIP TO MAIN CONTENT SUBSCRIBE SIGN IN DON'T BUILD YOUR BUSINESS WITH GOOGLE — $5,000 Google Jamboard dies in 2024—cloud-based apps will stop working, too Google's digital whiteboard for schools and businesses lasted 8 years. RON AMADEO - 9/28/2023, 10:11 PM The Google Jamboard was a big, red touchscreen. $5,000 for the screen, plus an optional $1,349 for the rolling stand (you can also wall-mount it). Google It came in three colors. Google The pricing at launch. Google Previous Slide Next Slide Even more Google products are getting the ax this week. Next up is Google Jamboard, a $5,000 digital whiteboard (and its $600-a-year fee) and software ecosystem marketed to schools and corporations. Google has a new post detailing the \"Next phase of digital whiteboarding for Google Workspace,\" and the future for Jamboard is that there is no future. In \"late 2024,\" the whole project will shut down, and we don't just mean the hardware will stop being for sale; the cloud-based apps will stop working, too. Most people probably haven't ever heard of Jamboard, but this was a giant 55-inch, 4K touchscreen on a rolling stand that launched in 2016. Like most Google touchscreens, this ran Android with a locked-down custom interface on top instead of the usual phone interface. The digital whiteboard could be drawn on using the included stylus or your fingers, and it even came with a big plastic \"eraser\" that would remove items. The SoC was an Nvidia Jetson TX1 (a quad-core Cortex-A57 CPU attached to a beefy Maxwell GPU), and it had a built-in camera, microphone, and speakers for video calls. There was HDMI input and Google cast support, and it came in whimsical colors like red, gray, and blue (it feels like Google was going for an iMac rainbow and quit halfway). Advertisement Google's secret sauce here was that Jamboard was heavily integrated with Google Workspace, so it could pull in items from Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, and all your whiteboard work was saved in a filetype called \"Jams\" in the usual Google storage. Like the other Workspace apps, this all worked live over the Internet. People not in front of the touchscreen could launch the \"Jamboard app\" instead, letting them get in on the whiteboard action remotely, complete with live handwriting. On the death of its latest product, Google says, \"We're grateful to the consumers, educators, students, and businesses who have used Jamboard since its launch in 2016. While Jamboard users make up a small portion of our Workspace customer base, we understand that this change will impact some of you, and we’re committed to helping you transition...\" Yes, that's right, \"transition\" is usually not something you have to consider when a company kills a hardware product, but the whole cloud system is going down, too, so all of your existing $5,000 whiteboards will soon be useless, and you won't be able to open the cloud data on other devices. \"Over the coming months, we’ll provide Jamboard app users and admins clear paths to retain their Jamboard data or migrate it,\" Google tells users in its blog post. The migration options are all third-party competitor whiteboard apps—Figma's FigJam, Lucid Software's Lucidspark, and Miro. Google says you can move your data in \"just a few clicks, well before the Jamboard app winds down in late 2024.\" Going forward, Google says it has \"decided to leverage our partner ecosystem for whiteboarding in Workspace,\" meaning exiting the whiteboard market, showing users the door, and telling them to take their data with them. You'll still need a new touchscreen, which means another pricey hardware purchase for existing Jamboard customers. Google seems to feel particularly bad for the schools that bought into this, saying, \"We will also work directly with educational institutions to compensate them for their Jamboard devices.\" Jamboard was a pricey item, but $5,000 was just the tip of the iceberg. There was a $600 \"annual management and support fee,\" plus subscriptions to Google Workspace for every user, plus an optional $1,350 for the rolling stand. A one-year total with a single Workspace user is around $7,000. People often ask about a recurring revenue stream when predicting what products will live and die, but even a $600-per-year fee attached to every sale wasn't enough to keep Jamboard running.

    "originBody": "{ Blog } Docs Support Pricing Log In Get started → Made with 💖 in California Introducing Enhance Music by Cole Peters @colepeters@mastodon.online on September 28, 2023 Today, the Enhance team is excited to introduce our latest demo app: Enhance Music — a music library and audio player app built with HTML and CSS, and progressively enhanced with a couple pinches of JavaScript. Despite being built as a traditional multipage website, Enhance Music features an audio player that persists across page loads, and some gorgeous interactive UI built entirely with web standards. As with our previous demo app, Enhance Movies, Enhance Music is designed to highlight the sort of developer and user experiences that can be achieved by focusing on building for the web platform itself, with a bit of help from Enhance. In this article, I’ll give you an in depth look at how Enhance Music works under the hood, with the hopes of giving you a few additions to your web development tool belt. Feel free to take a look at the codebase as you follow along! A fully functional music library, without the struggle stack Highly interactive interfaces (such as one for a music player) are often cited as reasons for employing a host of JavaScript libraries. We’re often told that the complexity of managing interactivity inherently requires third party frameworks and abstractions of markup, styling, and web platform APIs. I can recall this being at least occasionally true many years ago — it used to be that building even basic interfaces such as accordions or tabbed navigations on the web could prove to be tough without at least calling in the likes of jQuery to tame cross browser quirks. I can also recall the many years I spent building interfaces in React, when I’d immediately jump over to NPM as soon as I needed to build something more trivial than putting static text on a page. (Forms? Better check NPM. Dialogs? There’s a package for that. Animations? Spoiled for choice!) But is this still the case in 2023? Do we need to transpile proprietary dialects of JavaScript to describe our UI? Do we need fully featured state machines or reducer functions to keep track of permutations of those interfaces and their data? Do we need a Single Page App (SPA) architecture to deliver richly interactive and stateful experiences? We’ve found that the answer to all these questions is a hard ‘nope.’ Depending on your experience — and given the ubiquity of SPAs today — this answer may be surprising. But multipage sites aren’t the relic many might think they are. When asked to explain his preference for multipage architectures recently, Jeremy Keith wrote on his blog: For most use cases, a website (or multi-page app if you prefer) is going to provide the most robust experience for the most number of users. […] There are some cases where you’d want a state to persist across pages. Let’s say you’re playing a song, or a podcast episode. Ideally you’d want that player to continue seamlessly playing even as the user navigates around the site. In that situation, a single-page app would be a suitable architecture. But that architecture comes at a cost. I agree with Jeremy. I think there may still be some situations in which building an SPA is a suitable choice (though amusingly given Jeremy’s example of an audio player, we’d wrapped up Enhance Music just a day or two before). However, I also think the number of situations in which an SPA architecture can be recommended is dwindling, chiefly due to how good the web platform has become (and how much better it’s getting every day). And because so much of the rest of the ‘struggle stack’ (transpilers, unique dialects, etc.) was built to get around gaps in the web platform that no longer exist, the use cases for these tools is dwindling in tandem. This is good news: not only can we avoid piling up transient knowledge about a seemingly endless stream of dependencies, we can also eject from the routine stress of those dependencies changing or breaking under our feet and throwing wrenches into our workflows — all while delivering more robust and performant websites to end users. By delivering a rich (and resilient) interactive experience built solely with web standards and a multipage architecture, Enhance Music demonstrates this premise very well. So, without further ado, let’s start walking through how we built it. No component is an island The inspiration for Enhance Music came from Maxi Ferreira’s recently updated Astro Records demo app. What’s cool about this application is that it’s actually built on a multipage architecture, with a user experience that feels very much like an SPA. Although you can navigate through multiple pages (a library page, individual album pages), if you start playing a track, that audio player UI will stay with you as you move between those pages. This is accomplished using Astro Islands, which allows components rendered with client side JavaScript to persist between otherwise static page loads. The result is a traditional multipage website that gets upgraded to a more seamless experience in the browser. In combination with the View Transitions API, this produces a very slick result. There is a catch here, though: because Astro Islands (and other client side routing solutions, such as Turbo Drive) rely on JavaScript to function, these persistent interfaces can only be rendered if the application’s JavaScript downloads and executes successfully for the user. Unfortunately, that can be a big ‘if’. Not everyone has JavaScript — at least not all the time. This got us thinking: could we create a better experience for those users for whom JavaScript is unavailable? How could we use a multipage architecture while allowing some piece of our UI to persist between page loads without relying on JavaScript? Sometimes the old ways are the best ways, and in this case, we found our answer in an older HTML element: the Inline Frame element, better known as the iframe. Web developers typically associate iframes with third party integrations — think of embedding a YouTube video, Google Maps content, etc. But iframes can also be used to embed your own content within a parent page. Additionally, using the target attribute, links can target specific iframes within the parent document by name. Thus, if you were to embed two iframes within a document — say, one iframe for a music library, and another for an audio player — you could create a navigable music library in one iframe and a persistent audio player in another. And that’s exactly what we did. Structuring the foundations Looking at our website’s index page, you can see the content is straightforward: one title bar custom element, and our two iframes. When a user first accesses this page, the first iframe will contain our music library page, while the second (reserved for the audio player) will simply be blank, since no track has been selected yet. Wrapping this content is our layout grid custom element, which creates a grid layout for the three aforementioned elements. You can see that the first row of the grid will be sized automatically based on the content (that’s where our title bar custom element goes), while the second row (for our library iframe) will take up whatever remaining vertical space is available in the viewport. The last row, which will hold our audio player iframe, is sized using the grid-auto-rows property, as we’ll be doing some progressive enhancement later on to display that iframe dynamically. Our library page is pretty straightforward — it renders an instance of our music-library component, which contains a layout element for our grid of albums and an instance of our album-item element for each album in the library. Finally, each instance of this component links to a dedicated page for its album, which is rendered primarily with the album-data element. The album-data element involves a bit more orchestration of styling, logic, content, and interactivity, so let’s step through it briefly. The markup for this element is where we structure the content pertaining to each album. We start by reusing our album-cover element to show the album’s cover, and then we render a header element to contain all the top level information about the album, like its title, artist, record label, the year it was published, a link to a Bandcamp page (if one exists), and finally, a button to start playing the album. Finally, we render the album’s tracklisting using an ordered list, where each track gets its track number, title, and length dumped into a link. The way this track link is set up is important. Note that this link points to a dynamic route for the track itself, and that the link’s target attribute is set to player. That target attribute allows us to tell the browser to render that track’s page in our audio player iframe, since we named that iframe player in our index page. Thus, when a user selects a track for playback, that track will be rendered in the audio player’s iframe, leaving the user free to continue to navigate within the library’s iframe without affecting the audio player’s state. This gives us an audio player that follows us around the library — with zero JavaScript required. However, this doesn’t mean we can’t use JavaScript to upgrade the user experience when it’s available. This brings us to our first use case for progressive enhancement. Enhancing the tracklisting Any decent music library will provide some visual indication of which track in a tracklist is currently playing, and with just a little JavaScript, we can make that happen. To indicate which track is currently playing to both sighted users and those using a screenreader, we rely on the aria-current attribute. This attribute is perfect for our use case, as it’s meant to indicate which item within a list of items is currently active. To begin, note that within each link in our tracklist, we render both a track index and a playback icon in span elements. If you refer to our styles for the index and playing classes, you’ll note that the playback icon will only be rendered within a parent that matches the [aria-current='true'] selector — in which case, the track index (via the index class) will not be rendered. This means that all we need to do with JavaScript is to add the aria-current='true' attribute to the track that’s been selected by the user.[1] We accomplish this by registering an event handler on each track’s click event[2], getting the track number from the track’s data attributes, and running the setCurrent function with that track number to apply the aria-current attribute to the correct track element. We also run this function on the initial page render, in case a track in the album we’re viewing is already playing when the album’s page is loaded. With this code in place, users with JavaScript available will now see a playback icon appear in place of a track’s index when that track is played. Users without JavaScript will miss out on this, but given that this is a non essential feature, that’s alright — that’s why it’s called ‘progressive enhancement’ and not ‘progressive bare minimum’. That covers navigating between our library and its albums and choosing a track to play — but how do we manage actually playing those tracks? Let’s dive into our audio player implementation. Audio players for (almost) everyone As mentioned, each track in our album tracklist renders a link within a list item. That link, in turn, gets targeted to our audio player iframe when clicked. The route that we point to with each audio link gets handled by a dynamic API route (/player/$id.mjs), which is responsible for returning the relevant track data based on the dynamic portion of our route[3]. This data then gets passed to the audio player element via the state attribute (which you can see in action here). Finally, our audio player element can use that data to render our audio player. As with the rest of our app, we want to provide users with a fully functional experience when JavaScript is unavailable — and for that reason, we default to serving our users the selected track via the audio element. This will allow every user who downloads our HTML to play the audio back using a system audio player with full playback controls. The interface may look a little different between different browsers and operating systems, and it may not exactly match the look of the rest of our app, but that’s okay — it does a great job of playing back the audio the user requested! (Except in Safari[4] — see that footnote if you’re morbidly curious.) With our ‘zero JavaScript’ happy paths now covered, we can have a little more fun when JavaScript is available in the browser. Enhancing the audio player Building a custom audio player isn’t the easiest task, but it can produce great results, as we’ll find out shortly. The key is to use semantically appropriate elements wherever possible (and ARIA attributes when necessary), and getting to know the HTMLMediaElement interface as intimately as possible. Let’s start with the markup for our custom audio player. The entire component is wrapped in a figure element to indicate that the content inside it is self contained. Next, we add a button to toggle the playback of our audio track (note the ARIA attributes used to semantically relate this button to our audio element). Finally, we render some markup for the track’s metadata and album art, and — especially important — a range input to indicate and modify the track’s playback position. Since this input controls audio playback, we use an appropriate ARIA attribute here, too. Now that we’ve got our required markup, it’s time to dive into interactivity with Web Components and the HTMLMediaElement interface. The script tag which contains this functionality is a little gnarly, but we’ll walk through the most important points (and for the moment, we’ll bypass the portions of this script concerned with our waveform UI). First, take note of AudioPlayer class’s instance properties; we’ll be using these to refer to and modify certain aspects of our audio player. Next, note that we’re creating a new instance of our audio element programmatically. We do this instead of declaring an audio element with HTML because we need to attach event listeners to this element, and by the time this JavaScript executes on the client, some of those events may already have been fired by the browser before we can attach those listeners. (Yes, you read that right: we actually need to account for the fact that JavaScript is slower than HTML to get this right.) Next, we add an absolute ton of event listeners to our playback button, audio element, and our timeline (AKA our range input). This will allow us to use these events to trigger the expected behavior from our audio player. We’ll get to the specifics of these momentarily. At last, we get to render some content! Once all our setup is complete, we use a few DOM methods to hide the system audio player, insert our programmatically created audio element, and reveal our custom audio markup, which was previously hidden from view. In combination with our custom element styles (which are handily scoped to our custom element by Enhance), we now have a custom audio player ready to be interacted with. Let’s go over each of these interactions in a little more detail. Playing and pausing This one’s pretty straightforward. Our playback button fires the onPlayPause function when clicked. This function plays or pauses the audio track, depending on whether it’s currently paused or not. Then, because we registered event listeners for the play and pause events on the audio element itself, our playback button’s aria-pressed attribute will be updated accordingly by the onPlay and onPause functions. These attributes inform the user of the button’s current state, and cause the proper icon within the button to be displayed. Updating the current time display Every time the audio track’s currentTime property updates (usually a few times per second, depending on the client), our onTimeUpdate function is fired. This function is responsible for updating both the value of our timeline element (the range input) and the inner text of our custom audio player’s current time stamp. Adjusting the playback position Here’s where things get a little more nuanced. Along with indicating the audio track’s current playback position, we also want our timeline element to be interactive, allowing users to seek to a specific playback position within the audio track. This is why we used the HTML range input element for our timeline: it’s both illustrative (as we saw in the previous section) and modifiable. When users interact with HTML range inputs, developers can be notified of changes to its value at two different stages: first, input.oninput, which occurs while the input is being modified (i.e., the user is actively dragging or otherwise manipulating the input); and second, input.onchange, which occurs when the user finally commits a particular value (i.e., when the user disengages the range input). This is important to know, as we need to handle each event differently. To begin, let’s examine our onTimelineInput function, which fires every time the input is manipulated. Because we’re keeping our timeline’s value in sync with the audio track’s currentTime property, we first need to remove the event listener responsible for doing so — otherwise, the user’s interaction would be cut short by the audio track continuing to update the input’s value in the background. By removing that event listener, we can give the user full control of the input’s value (and position). Next, as the user continues to update the timeline’s value, we use that value (provided by the event.target.value property) to set the UI’s current time stamp, in order to indicate this position in time to the user. Eventually, the user will commit a value to the range input — this is where our onTimelineChange function takes over. In this function, we first assign the chosen value to both our timeline input and the audio track’s currentTime property. Then, in order for the timeline to resume staying in sync with the audio track’s playback position, we reregister our event listener and callback. Whew! It’s a bit of a whirlwind, but with this code in place, we now have a fully interactive custom audio player! At this point in developing Enhance Music, we were pretty happy with our results. We had a navigable music library with a persistent audio player, and a bunch of great progressive enhancements to make things look and feel smooth via JavaScript (when available). But then we got a little greedy and decided to add another bell and whistle or two. Final enhancements As I mentioned earlier, there are a lot of presumptions out there about what can and cannot be accomplished in terms of UI without resorting to pulling in JavaScript libraries like React. This especially extends to creating rich, dynamic visual effects and data visualizations. We wanted to take this opportunity to demonstrate that web standards are fully up to this task — and that using them to do so can actually be pretty straightforward! A common visualization we see on a lot of audio player interfaces is a representation of the current audio track’s waveform. We thought it would be awesome to do something like this with Enhance Music to provide a little more information about the current track’s content and dynamics, as well as to satisfy our cravings for a little razzle dazzle. I mentioned avoiding the propensity to resort to NPM as a first response earlier, but that doesn’t mean we should ignore the value of NPM entirely. At this point, not wanting to invest the time required to learn how to derive a waveform graphic from an audio file from scratch, we finally headed over to NPM to see what sort of libraries might be available to help us out with this. That’s where we found Wavesurfer.js, an open source JavaScript library for generating and customizing waveforms, with support for HTML5 Audio and Web Audio. With an easy to follow interface and a mere 43kb addition to our site’s payload, this was a perfect solution for our needs. Waveform.js uses the Canvas API to generate its graphics, so after a bit of poking around through various docs on MDN to learn about canvas gradients, I was able to come up with a couple of custom gradients to use as the fill for our custom waveform. Applying that gradient to our Wavesurfer instance and adding further customizations was a piece of cake. So, too, was syncing the Wavesurfer instance up with our audio track’s progress, which provided us with even more flair for our custom audio player. With this in place (and using a little CSS filtering on our audio player), we arrived at a gorgeous visualization of our audio track, layered beneath our custom audio player. We decided to add one more piece of progressive enhancement to Enhance Music at this point: hiding the audio player iframe when a track hasn’t been loaded. The empty audio player iframe taking up room on our layout when there was no content to show wasn’t ideal, but it took just a sprinkling of JavaScript to hide the iframe once our script loads, and to then listen for load events on it to show the iframe once an audio track has been selected. No sweat! Our final investigation for Enhance Music’s UI focused on view transitions. This worked well when testing our library view in isolation (and you can see it in action here, using Chrome Canary), but upon verifying this in the app itself, we realized that view transitions are not yet supported in iframes. Given that this spec is still so early in its rollout, that’s pretty understandable; we even got a bug filed in Chromium to track this. Once the spec rolls out though, this simple addition to our album cover element should have view transitions working smoothly, which should help to make navigation through the library even more seamless. A fully functional music library, backed by great performance Not only is Enhance Music a great example of a fully functional interactive app built entirely with web standards, it also performs exceptionally well: as in, ‘all 100s on PageSpeed Insights’. But honestly, getting the performance to this point mostly just happened on its own. We formatted our album covers as .webp images and sized them appropriately, and we kept bundle sizes in mind when looking for waveform libraries on NPM, but otherwise, the strategy here could be summed up as: ‘Use the platform.’ By relying on HTML, CSS, and the smallest amount of JavaScript necessary, achieving great performance becomes almost a matter of course. This isn’t to say that no thinking had to be done at all — after all, Enhance is built from the ground up with performance in mind, and we did spend a bit of time researching appropriate ARIA attributes for our custom audio player — but rather that by working with the grain of the platform instead of ejecting into JS frameworks, transpilers, and other overheads, one learns to build performantly (and accessibly) from the start, rather than trying to make performance and accessibility happen in the ‘polishing’ stage (which seldom works anyway). This is as true for authoring simple static sites as it is for rich interactive web apps — and I think Enhance Music demonstrates this quite well! Summing up: on the longevity of web standards Working on Enhance Music over these past weeks reminded me of the last time I worked on a web project involving an audio player. I was building a module for a pretty intense React application — a series of learning activities for English students, which required a custom audio player to play back pieces of dialogue or other spoken materials. While both that audio player and the audio player for Enhance Music were built on top of the HTMLMediaElement interface, the former was necessarily interlaced with React specific implementation details — details that involved time, problem solving, and results that I will never be able to transfer to another project or component. Even if I were to build that audio player in React again today, I’m confident that at least some of the React specific details would have to change to be compliant with the current version of React. The audio player for Enhance Music, meanwhile — being built solely with web standards — has given me knowledge and tools that I will be able to bring with me as long as the web platform itself exists. That’s pretty powerful. This isn’t meant to disparage React, or any other JavaScript view framework. For me, this instead highlights the incredible benefits of learning and building with web standards: your code — and more importantly, the knowledge you acquire while writing it — remains portable forever. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fully backwards and forwards compatible, and modern web browsers are too. The knowledge I’ve picked up building Enhance Music will remain useful and applicable for as long as I’m writing code for the web, which will allow me to focus on critical problem solving in the future, rather than relearning problem solving strategies I’ve already internalized. In today’s fast paced web ecosystem, that’s a huge advantage — and, frankly, a relief. Not only does this knowledge remain useful, but the results speak for themselves: Enhance Music delivers exceptional performance, a beautiful multimodal interface, and is even ready for future web features like view transitions in iframes (presuming the spec doesn’t change — which, to be fair, it could… but that’s okay). I hope this deep dive through Enhance Music has been as enjoyable to read as it was to create the project itself, and I hope it’s given you some ideas for your next project! Please feel free to explore the source code and borrow whatever pieces of it might be useful to you. And if you’re excited about what can be done with Enhance, be sure to check out the Enhance website and docs, or join us on Discord to ask questions or share your ideas. See you next time! Note that we don’t write aria-current='false' to our track lis’ markup by default. If we did this, screenreader users who don’t have our JavaScript available would be told that none of the tracks are the ‘current’ track, even after selecting one for playback, which would be confusing to say the least. For this reason, we only include aria-current='false' attributes when updating all of the tracks via JavaScript. ↩︎ Because a click event might occur on an element nested within the track’s li element, we use the closest function to get to the li’s dataset from the event’s target. ↩︎ For more on dynamic routes and path parameters, see the Enhance docs. ↩︎ First, the autoplay attribute we’ve used on the audio element won’t work the first time an audio track is loaded in Safari. WebKit exerts much stricter controls over this attribute than other browsers, so you’ll need to play the first track you request manually if you’re exploring Enhance Music in Safari (this will also apply to our custom audio player). Unfortunately, if you have JavaScript disabled, none of this will matter: Safari itself seems to require JavaScript in order to play back audio files, which is quite a vibe. Attempting to play audio files with Safari’s ‘Disable JavaScript’ option enabled completely prevented audio files from playing at all in our testing, even when requesting the file directly from the Network inspector. Turn JavaScript on, and presto: Safari will gladly play that same audio file! You can’t say we didn’t try. ↩︎ © 2022-2023 Beginner Corp. Made with 💖 in California",

Even for a tech person who is used to some very hostile UX day in and day out, I would still not use that if I have the option. reply Signez 6 hours agoprevAt first, I thought it was a good exercise (and it still is), but going through the result [0] made me more skeptical.It is... slow? I mean, Internet Explorer slow. Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled by the level of responsiveness of application-style web interfaces, but opening an album or returning to the library feels slow. Is it because I&#x27;m browsing from Western Europe and the application is hosted in the USA?I&#x27;m used to browsing multi-page apps that don&#x27;t pretend to be apps, and having a 500ms load time after a click is expected and feels right.

As far as I can tell, this is what we were doing before JS became the mighty weapon it is today (like pre-2005).So if you don&#x27;t like JS, this is a pattern you might want to revive, but I can hardly believe, that we want to go back to that world as a standard for web development. reply pjmlp 1 hour agoparentWe not only want to in name of performance, the new folks are rediscovering gunpowder as we say back home, adding SSG and SSR to SPA frameworks. reply tethys 1 hour agoprevJust a side note: It bothers me a bit that most audio player interfaces make it unnecessarily difficult to navigate within a title. This here is a good example: The waveform extends across the entire width of the window and could be wonderfully used to jump precisely to the desired spot (Soundcloud does this comparatively well). Instead, I only have an extremely narrow bar here, where a few pixels of movement mean a jump of several seconds. reply montag 4 minutes agoparentIt’s also common to see a seek bar that is too thin and hard to click.This one is 19px tall: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chiptune.app reply danjac 3 hours agoprevI built a podcast library&#x2F;player[1] using HTMX and Alpine, using Django as the backend.

Even though back and forward buttons work, navigating to an album won&#x27;t update the URL which won&#x27;t allow sharing and will be bad for search engines since all navigation points to the same URL. reply tgv 2 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s fairly easy to fix (in principle; I don&#x27;t know what their backend is; it might require JS).But there&#x27;s so little value in the navigation, that I&#x27;m not surprised it works as an \"MPA\" (even though it feels janky). And that&#x27;s all not done by JavaScript. The player, the animation, etc. still requires it.

While there’s nothing wrong with JS in itself, the less that’s required the better from several angles — the big ones for me are less required dev work, less need for miles-long lists of dependencies, and better likelihood that the various components of the app are implemented consistently well since they’re the responsibility of web engine maintainers instead of random library devs.For me personally web front end as a platform becomes progressively more interesting as HTML includes more robust widgets and functionality. reply zerbinxx 5 hours agoparentDevil’s advocacy here (and I know this is overwrought and beaten to absolute death here and abroad daily) but is a large dependency tree really that bad?Most modern backend development assumes a ton of dependency management, tech like Docker has proven for at least 10 years that it can be manageable in production at scale. While I get that browser compatibility can be a pain in a way that the backend doesn’t have to reckon with I don’t really see why dependency management for something like React should be a decision factor for front end.That’s also not to insinuate that we should just do it (SPA + massive amounts of JS) because browsers can handle it or that there are zero downsides to JS dependency management, but rather that the positives and negatives of zero-JS solutions should be adjudicated on things like developer experience and speed of delivery. reply zelphirkalt 1 hour agorootparentLarge dependency trees are usually not about using docker or not. That is rarely a dependency of the code itself. The complaint about large dependency trees is about hundreds or even thousands of dependencies of the code itself, where you could get away with maybe tens, if you write trivial code (left pad ...) yourself and avoided needlessly adding more stuff on top. Every time one adds a dependency, one should feel a little sting and make an uncomfortable face and remember, that this dependency might make things badly maintainable, difficult to upgrade, or vulnerable. Always ask oneself things like: \"Did I read the code of that dependency and its dependencies? Do I really know what this code does?\" and of course if one does now lock down that dependency to exactly one version, one would have to consider these things every time one upgrades dependencies.Now for a throwaway web app maybe one does not need to care. But then one should also label it as such. A throwaway, nothing to be taken as a good example. Definitely not production ready code. reply jwells89 1 hour agorootparentprevI’m not an HTML purist, JS is fine, but I prefer to use it only where it’s necessary.The main thing that’s bad about massive dependency trees in my mind is that it makes them difficult to keep a mental map of, which makes for pain when things go awry. Most of the work I do is on iOS apps which is a generally more “batteries included” environment, and there most dependencies only go a level or two deep, which is reasonable to reason about and makes it more practical to track down problems. iOS apps also just don’t need as many dependencies in the first place.It’s not practical for web front end to require as few dependencies as e.g. iOS, but I think it’s a worthwhile endeavor to push that line as far as it can go so it’s more practical to develop a complex low-dependency web app. reply wg0 1 hour agoprevWe&#x27;re again swinging to the extremes. reply zagrebian 7 hours agoprevI browse the the web on desktop with JavaScript disabled by default.

Seems like a reasonable idea, and you wouldn&#x27;t even need Javascript! reply notatoad 6 hours agoparentthe biggest problem, at least for me, is that it breaks links - you can only link to the frameset, not the actual page, and the url doesn&#x27;t change on navigation.unless you start doing javascript address bar manipulations, in which case you&#x27;ve got both an SPA and frames. reply LeoPanthera 5 hours agorootparentIs this really that different to javascript applications where the state does not alter the URL?

    "originLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVCS99Zep9w",
    "originBody": "yeah here we go so hi everyone i'm alex hi i'm mikhaila and welcome back to the episode three of our series computers of chernobyl it's a series where we explore and study use of computer equipment in a chernobyl exclusion zone so in previous two episodes we told you about the restoration of es1841 the soviet uh 8086 intel clone based computer the same as was used back in the chernobyl zone in the end of 80s beginning of 90s so what we will do today we will make a very very pure start of the complete setup in nearly 30 years of course we tried to test some individual components but all together as only the first time all we know getting some original software was kind of a challenging task but among other programs today we are going to show you a software written and used in chernobyl back in the 80s but all programs that time were generally distributed on pretty low quality floppy disks and very little survival today intact but with the help of retro computing community and a few friends we have some floppy disks like this video subscribe to our channel investgo even a longer version of this video as well as restoration backstages and a lot of translated documentation will be on our battery one so please check it link is in description below before all let's see our launch setup in the system unit we have a processor board with a soviet clone of intel 8086 processor installed but we will go in a more hardcore way so we are going to run it with no arithmetical co-processor as for memory we will have two boards that form a 640 kilobytes of ram as for graphic cards we made it little bit tricky because according to the user manual the graphic card provides only a signal for a composite display but upon the third examination of electronic circuits we found that it's actually full ega so we played the jumpers and made this kind of adapter it allows to connect an ej monitor and at the same time to get black and white composite signal that we will process by usb capture adapter plug it into a mac mini with a quick time running this will allow us to make a full screen capture that will put also on our patreon page technically as maximum this computer supports up to four floppy drives at the same time but by the standard configuration which we use we have two of them connected via shared cable we also have a native mouse which is plugged into the same controller that's it just look on it and hear this sound also we have a ports controller and we want to try some printing so we made the yes to centronics cable the printer is a modern version of epson lx 300 which has many interfaces we needed to play with its settings to work with centronics only and a few words about the keyboard because it's a little bit unusual it's a soviet rework of a pc keyboard it's hall effect based and many buttons were renamed some such as f11 or f12 are missing so there are only 10 function buttons so we know an escape is called the key control is called upper out is called dope which is shortening from additional in russian and there are also separate language switches there are two lock buttons with for kirilik and latin they have leds and this air slash l is for quick reward switching the keyboard is in ideal shape but it has randomly appearing trouble with one button so time to time you have to change it to a more destroyed but fully functional one and the bitter thing is that we have a function of aesthetic 225 mfm hard drive and a controller but we won't use the hard drive because its brain chip was in this condition well even the soviets had everything in top quality since i discovered a corrosion of gold the iron is the controller is 0 0 18 which is the rarest modifications of them and i cannot find any replacement for this chip in ukraine wherever i search it alright so let's power it on the first we start the disks and we put a floppy disk with the operation system into the drive one by the way the ej monitor we use has a switch that torrents it to green or to amber which we'll use for a sharper picture next we start the system unit you know for me this feels like a look to the time itself because exactly the same it was back in the 80s like imagine you sit in front of such a picture in a dead city where only a few facilities operating with a lot of precautions and you do your tasks via this painfully slow machine yes feels please write us in the comments if you had something that felt for you the same also good so it made one beep and then started the boot process the operation system we're going to use is alpha dose it's a soviet report of the pc dose with some added modifications honestly it's quite glitchy so many users were moving to ms-dos 33 if it was available what is interesting however that alpha dos is fully translated to russian we have a successful boot and a date and a time prompt also in russian language and here we have a welcome message saying software package of a personal professional yes computer alpha dos version 02.01 all comments are also translated so you can type both in weighting or kerillic for example type cut to get the directory structure or you can type deer okay that sums up our emotions during restoration okay by the way a backstage restoration you can find on patreon uh that is also quite interesting okay correctly dear slash p so the config sees has a mandatory load of the system.cs which was patched for kyrillic support and noticed that many utilities and even five extensions were also translated for example two files on the bottom are fdisk and format and note that disk prompt it's not a b or c as we use it it is one two or three there are separate drivers for various types of printers you need to run before you can actually print so that's like a com files also code in russian language all right let's try to use some software that was shipped with yes 1841 standard package for alpha-dos there were apps like slog which was a text processor a bug which was cloned visicalc such kind of primitive table processor micro programming system and so on but uh we so far got only one up from this set uh it is called dilograph which is application to make uh various charts and diagrams uh it's pretty sophisticated so as far as we know it was also used in the chernobyl zone as well what is interesting that if you launch it on a more modern dose computer it will be in 16 colors by one yes 1841 its monochrome despite the machine works in ega cover set well if you can explain this to me why it is so just please write in the comments okay here it is graphica which means business graphics here we can make pie charts histograms line diagrams or draw a mass function it says use orals or space bar to navigate the menu then press enter so let's make a pie chart the most visual example here we have a menu so let's get some details how to use it okay so here we have maximum formal language signature soviet style i would say and it says the main menu of the graphic object defines actions you can perform during creation of the graphic object by pressing a corresponding functional key is it possible enter data to build graphic objects from keyboard input f1 or read it from the file f2 modify the android data f3 write data to the file on the disk f4 build the graphic object by existing data and output to the screen f5 or the printer f6 build the graphic object by existing data and write it to the file on disk f8 read the graphic object from a file and output to the screen or on printer f9 alright let's enter some data so title let it be test diagram then value then description and then it says outlined sector frankly no idea what to write here so again press if to get some help okay to get more visual image is it possible to outline some sectors of the diagram type on keyboard the symbol d and press enter to outline the sector okay so let's outline this first sector and then enter some more data then we exit to main menu and then press f5 to draw it lovely but how slow it actually is okay uh now let's try to save it so i press a4 and it asks me for a file name let it be a test diag like a test diagram no idea which extension is meant to be here okay now let's try to open a file there is no file list actually expected so you need to type it okay now type it and here we can draw it all right and what if i press f9 to have a file released as it says excellent enter the file name and what does the help say again this communist language to get an information about files on the disk type on a keyboard and name of the file and press the enter key under the name of a file with meant a specification of the file in particular a name of a disk name of a catalog in alpha dos the name of the file itself and the name and the type of the file may use symbols of placeholding risk and question mark the length of the file is limited by glowing window during typing the name of a file can be edited using commands of cursor movement and commands of insertion and deletion disk will be searched for all files with entered specification better they would explain what the wild cards do again let's try an asterisk no idea maybe it will work okay so we have a file and if you do the same you obviously get the drawing log before okay let's move i think to the more interesting stuff the next app i want to show you is really special it's a program for processing radiation measurements it was written in chernobyl zone it's called infogama and here it says information computer center of the production association combinat town of chernobyl 1988 and here is necessary historical detail because this entity the pio combinator it was created shortly after the chernobyl disaster it was kind of super centralized management organization which belonged absolutely everything in the zone even the power plant was in their realm and it was very obscure very cryptic and really decentralized like this it existed after 1990. by the way we are translated to english this rarest book set it was published by combinat in just 100 copies and it contains exceptionally interesting data and soon we will start a series of videos about all of that unknown things so here we have a menu uh this entering the new data set then reading data from file and reading the data using the current loop interface i don't know maybe from some device only one thing we needed to reboot to pure ms dos uh because in our photos our matrix printer works pretty strange uh so if we go for data entering what do we have here it says these instrument's purpose is to enter only a new data set please enter a number of accounting card of the data set you need to process uh so basically it's all about gathering the data of some field measurements enter the surname and initials of the dosimetrist who made the measurements let it be me next screen choose the unit of the power of exposition dose exposition those that have in the zone the radiation levels call it in let's say more scientifically correct way so options are ranges per hour uh miller engines per hour micro ranges per hour also per minute and per second you know i kind of feel for a guy who measure it somewhere micro ranges per second they have to say all right let it be mili ranges per hour choose the device used for measurements uh these actually you set in a configuration file so i added here a few classical dosimeters and let's select dp5v if you don't know exactly this is that device that had this in famous 3.6 rangers maximum very well pictured in hbo chernobyl mini series so that's it type the human readable name of the data set if the device hadn't been selected write its type here and next we need to enter the data per every measurement point whether it be the viewer of kopachi which is completely buried so much it was contaminated and next is this uh i assume this is a control level because the idea is when there is a contaminated place the standard maximum levels for a normal life are pretty pointless to use because they will be always exceeded but some control levels define it and it means something average uh expectable that very place so i don't know let it be 25 millions per hour now we type the date and a time and by the way if i press enter it will be automatically zero zero uh then we put a level and if needed we can also make a notice so here we go okay now let's press f6 to save it and we have a file with the card name okay now let's go to the file list and let's open that file okay reading and we have our data table and summary on the top here is f4 for utilities but i do not have them you need to add files and configuration but what we can do with a test that we can try to print it so i press the f3 and but if i press f2 i can build diagrams for each point and we have our control levels as well as a delta between minimum and maximum values beautiful so such an app if you will find some more chernobyl software we will show it in our future videos as well so don't forget to subscribe i rebooted back to alpha dos because there is one more cool thing to show which is native for this operation system uh it's a file manager which is called command os or commanders basically before let's initialize the mouse by calling its driver and then we start a batch file that launched the file manager a funny detail however that uh commandos breaks the building keralix support and it will remain so even if you exit so after this i will again go to ms-dos but cool thing that this commandos was written by some guys who actually had some sense of humor so if you do not have a second floppy discard inserted it will throw you a red pop-up with a text literally saying a very scary unresolvable error or curette like word by word translation but we have it in so it reads and here we are this looks close to norton commander in some meaning i even see the mouse doesn't work no i will not use it because it's freaking inconvenient in the end so let's use keyboard if you press f1 uh here the list of all the main commands such as switching panels viewing files editing copying deleting directories all usual but i have to say there is no built-in editor you need to link some via configuration in the panel menu there are a few view options but there is no d-ring for contrary to norton commander in commands menu wow an alarm clock and then here is something called as a memory card that's basically a task manager but it doesn't seem to allow to actually kill the process it just at least what is in memory and also there is a built-in calculator well it's not so cool as a calculator i will show you next but also pretty convenient to have it here we can also turn the interface to monochrome colors hem and back to colors if needed in the files menu there are some operations available the same as i described before okay so no bad and works pretty well uh now i will again reboot ms-dos because as i said kirilik had crushed in ms dose let's first initialize the mouse once more and we can launch the volkov commander that super compact like function functional clone of norton made in ukraine in the beginning of 90s uh and it will look this way here okay he's angry about absent hard disk close okay so we need to run the special driver uh made specifically for yes 1841 to fix the issue in a full version of this video which you can find on patreon there will be more software but here let's try one more chernobyl up which is a calculator but what's so special it was made by the main computer center of the ministry of energy of the soviet union it has many functions such as formula handling counting degrees and so on and although it is in the console you can even move it across the screen pretty cool alright enough serious stuff for now it's time for some games let's play some classical games i have a digger here ah this how does it feel um returning to the childhood and um when i was visiting my friends and they had a computer because i never had a computer so my friends they did it and they had it and it was so so unusual for us well because honestly i played uh i played this on uh poisk one uh that's ukrainian computer uh producer from the underweight yes but in the 90s it's like a one-man blocky board and uh i remember we were loading this from cassette that was kind of 1992 i think but i have to say the game is pretty notably slow here [Laughter] amazing by the way i have to say still have no idea how to exit you don't catch me [Laughter] it's a perfect game [Laughter] it's amazing we called these enemies the frogs i don't know why or what they should be but we call them frogs so be careful that the frog does not bite you so i decided to play a little more and i got also what is this here are coming this all the creatures and everything that you can collect here and the bonus is in form of cherry it's such a return to the childhood i love this old game because it's really evoking memories and i would like to show you one more cool historical artifact the thing is apart from alpha dos and ms-dos es1841 could run m86 which was a soviet clone of cpm operation system we have some discards as well some software for it but problem is until we fix the hard drive issue it will not work it takes more space than one discard to install it so this nevertheless will be interesting for cpm funds because these are original translations of the cpm user manual made by some soviet state translation agency there are even many handwritten things here as they didn't know or didn't have on what uh to type english letters i have to say this all looks socialistic but this was the kind of things people were really hunting for in the conditions of the iron curtain let us know in the comments if you would like us to make a bonus video where we will try to run cpm on this very computer so that's it don't forget to like this video subscribe to our channel check also our patient patreon because there will be a full screen recording and various documentation translated to

I accidentally formatted a games diskette on it for the first time, after accidentally fumbling something in Norton Commander. I think I was around 6.I was one of the few kids in my elementary school with a computer and a printer, so I was able to score some clout with the classmates, until a few of the richer kids starter to have access to more modern computers.We had 256 KB of RAM until my dad upgraded it to 512.

That set USSR back so much that it would never catch up. I think thats an important lesson to remember re: politicians influencing scientific research to match their narrative. reply orbital-decay 8 hours agoparentThis comment just recites the popular myth which makes zero sense, especially in the context of the video in OP, which is about a soviet computer.Cybernetics has nothing to do with computing or computers at all; it was a very opinionated attempt at explaining natural and social phenomena in terms of some narrow snippets of control theory. Nothing from that media panic \"set USSR back\" in computing; the control theory was being used in engineering (case in point: R-7 with a SOTA control system), computers were being developed (BESM-6 was introduced long after the moral panic caused by Wiener&#x27;s book ended), etc.The real cause was the engineering tradition (and planned economy which led to twisted economic incentives). Soviet engineering school has been influenced by the German one for half a century, and was really slow at picking up computer science and software engineering as separate disciplines; both were mostly seen as some unimportant subset of applied math. It wasn&#x27;t some ideological bullshit, just genuine inertia. By the time US programmers had a strong software development culture, Soviet programming culture was stuck at the pure math level. Just read any Soviet textbook or programming manual from that era and you will see the difference immediately. Hardware development has been following suit, struggling not just from the lack of the expertise in high purity chemistry (traditionally weak point of Soviet physics and engineering) and semiconductors, but also from the lack of direction set by the software development and economic incentives. That&#x27;s why the Soviets decided to copy IBM - and the computer in OP is an IBM PC clone. Not because of the cybernetics (the panic was unrelated and died long before that decision) or any other reason.>that it would never catch upHardware, sure. The software development eventually started to catch up around mid-80s, when the Soviet computing craze has started with first personal computers that were more or less accessible to the population. reply cyberax 10 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s really exaggerated.The first institute tasked with creating computers was set up in 1948, the same year the word \"cybernetics\" appeared. The USSR had nothing against computer science, and the initial progress in that area was not that bad (given the post-war scarcity). The USSR mainly had issues with some of the more philosophical parts of Norbert Wiener&#x27;s books.The USSR failed in its usual manner: the progress was great only while it required just individual brilliance, or something that could be constructed by small teams.So the USSR had pretty decent discrete-logic computers, including truly innovative stuff like Setun&#x27; that was based on ternary logic. And then the USSR predictably started losing ground, once the world moved to integrated circuits. reply bmc7505 10 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cybernetics_in_the_Soviet_Unio... reply ok123456 10 hours agorootparentprevIt was complicated [1].

Back then, I tried to find the original sources for the supposed Stalin&#x27;s disdain for computers.I could not find much in favor or against it. I would say that Stalin really did not care much, in the sense that he was not concerned about computers either way. He had way too much stuff on his plate anyway: executing medical doctors, trying to claw back power from WWII military leaders, that sort of stuff.The USSR also started serious computation research in 1948, including construction of a fully programmable computer (\"MESM - Small Electronic Calculating Device\") that was finished in 1950. It actually fit the USSR ideology quite well, the economy was supposed to be centrally planned and computing devices obviously are helpful in creating plans.Some early computing history of the USSR is fascinating, with real spies and drama. E.g.: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alfred_SarantSo my opinion: there was no real persecution of the early computer science in the USSR. And it&#x27;s not the reason the USSR eventually fell behind.The _networking_ was an entirely different story. The USSR government instinctively was against making communication across hierarchical structures easier. reply avodonosov 2 hours agoparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;yS_-NArgjik?si=31fFU7O2WbUFcTTzhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kino-teatr.ru&#x2F;movie&#x2F;kadr&#x2F;4780&#x2F;65656.jpgJust a funny reminder of how it was promoted at some point. reply rep_lodsb 10 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s strange, because from what I&#x27;ve read, \"cybernetics\" as a scientific discipline was much more influential in the USSR than it ever was in western countries. The term is now almost exclusively associated with (digital) computers, but originally it was more about feedback loops in analog systems, and its theories were applied to centralised economic planning.

Teneo, a financial advisory firm controlling the liquidation and management of affairs for the defunct crypto hedge fund, said it got a “committal order” against Zhu after he failed to comply with court orders to cooperate with the liquidation investigation. The order sentenced Zhu to four months in prison, according to a statement. The advisory firm added that a similar committal order was granted against the other 3AC co-founder, Kyle Davies, who is also being called for four month imprisonment. Davies’ whereabouts remain unknown, according to Teneo. For context, the firm once managed an estimated $10 billion in assets and was a major entity among crypto market players. In July 2022, 3AC filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in New York. The hedge fund’s prior insolvency forced major crypto players to rearrange their operations and limit customer withdrawals amid a crypto sell-off that seemed to catch plenty of mega firms off guard at the time, after the collapse of the Terra/LUNA project. Teneo did not immediately reply to a request for comment from TechCrunch.

In many countries in Asia, a lot of rich people take these route. You can also routinely find prosecutors and some other businessmen killed in region coubtries in ASEAN. Most countries especially the richer one in ASEAN have government orders to media not to report these kind of news. Even if needs to, they will put in inner less critical media page and as non desceiptive as possible. The going rate is aroun 5000 usd...and that is market rate for amateur level death angels. It is incredibily effective sometime even CIA are scared to retaliate (remember many law enforcers have family members and near impossible to protect them). Philipines previous president actually use this method to tame the crooks there. In Asia, there is a saying where bigger dog eat smaller dog. And that is why China governance employ this.

Personally I think it&#x27;s more like 50-100 million by the time you factor in users on different chains, different wallets, etc. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time analyzing chains to come to that number, it&#x27;s not difficult. Nearly every crypto user participates on more than one chain and often uses at least two addresses (hot and cold wallet, for example).Sure enough, the quote is right there in the report:\"over 25 million blockchain addresses held over $1 in stablecoins\"25 million addresses, which absolutely don&#x27;t equal users. Even if they did, that&#x27;s .05% of global internet users (5.2 billion). With the threshold for inclusion at $1...Of course you say \"moving as much value\" which doesn&#x27;t necessarily correlate directly to users or their activity but I would venture to guess (if the report is accurate at all) that a substantial portion of that stablecoin \"value\" volume isn&#x27;t anything resembling the economic activity of Visa where every swipe is in exchange for a good or service. At best settlement between exchanges but also wash trading and all kinds of weird hijinx that are basically just swapping tokens around with no other meaningful economic activity.

Visa is not a currency. Visa serves as a payment network, akin to Paypal. These platforms can, and in some instances such as Paypal, do support transactions in cryptocurrencies alongside fiat currencies.In the realm of fiat currency, the closest analogue to owning a Bitcoin or Ethereum account might be holding physical cash or digitally, maintaining an account at a Federal Reserve Bank. However, the latter is rare and nearly impossible to establish, making it accessible only to exceptionally large banking institutions. A more common comparison might be that having a regular bank account is similar to having a custodial cryptocurrency account (e.g. on an exchange, PayPal, RobinHood, etc.), as it represents a method of holding without possessing the currency directly.Regarding the 25 million figure, it&#x27;s difficult to know with certainty but it is very likely that the figure understates the amount of users, as custodial accounts tend to be more common and they do not result in new on-chain addresses. Also, I&#x27;m not sure where the figure comes from because for Bitcoin alone, there are over 40 million addresses with at least 1$[0].> has nothing to do with helping regular people, the oppressed, the unbanked, whatever.As someone who was unbanked for a long time, and having talked to many people in that situation (most recently a couple of Russian immigrants), you are talking out of your ass here.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitinfocharts.com&#x2F;top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.... reply tkz1312 13 hours agorootparentprevvisa very clearly much more users who transact much lower amounts than stablecoins, I never claimed otherwise.The fact remains that substantial amounts of people are using crypto rails to move very economically significant sums of money.The fact that something can be used by bad people does not make the thing itself bad.

The reasoning is that the supply shock trends prices upwards and the rest of the market tracks Bitcoin due to many trading pairs between it and other cryptos. But the shock gets weaker over time and hopefully the nonsense will as well. reply anonporridge 15 hours agorootparentIt is interesting, because while the shock does get weaker in relative terms it&#x27;s getting stronger in absolute terms. i.e. a billion dollar shock to a billion dollar asset is relatively bigger than a 100 billion dollar shock to a 500 billion dollar asset (bitcoin&#x27;s current \"market cap\"), but the latter requires 100x the size of wealth flow.The next supply shock will also be interesting in its own right, specifically because it will plunge bitcoin&#x27;s inflation rate to below that of gold, from 1.7% now to 0.84% in 7 months. If nothing else, that will re-highlight bitcoin&#x27;s digital gold narrative and potentially pull in more wealth flow that otherwise might have flowed into store of value assets like gold.Bitcoin at current price and inflation rate requires $9 billion per year net inflows to absorb newly mined coins. In 7 months after the halving, it will only require $4.5 billion per year to maintain it&#x27;s current price of $27,000. So, either it&#x27;s net inflow will suddenly cut in half and the price will stay the same, or the current net inflow of $9 billion will force the price up until it reaches equilibrium, which usually triggers a market frenzy as outsiders see the gains and pile in.For some context with gold, there theoretically exists about $200 billion of wealth flowing into it each year just to absorb newly mined gold and keep the price stable. reply georgeecollins 13 hours agorootparentThis is great analysis. The only caveat I would add is that while bitcoin is commonly priced in $ (fiat USD) it is much more commonly bought and sold in USDT. In fact, if a bunch of actors decided to sell bitcoin there might be plenty of USDT for that but not US$.Some of that is due to the fact that exchanges don&#x27;t due proper KYC and have trouble maintaining US banking arrangements. Some of it may be that the market is propped up by less fiat then it would need to be liquid in fiat.I am not saying that as a problem-- maybe-- I don&#x27;t know. I am just saying that as if you say bitcoin currently requires $9b usd a year to maintain its price that is not actually true. reply anonporridge 7 hours agorootparentCan miners generating new coins pay their electricity bills in USDT? replynerf0 17 hours agoparentprevI work in this area and to me, the tech is still super interesting. In particular, things like zero knowledge proof and related scaling&#x2F;privacy solutions are at the forefront of cryptography in my opinion. reply iskander 17 hours agorootparentI gave the \"industry\" a pretty thorough deep dive; I learned Solidity, wrote a bunch of smart contracts, tried a lot of DeFi, and listened to ~100 episodes of the Zero Knowledge podcast.My impression on the other end of it is that the \"tech\" is interesting in a purely academic sense but most of the participants are building things they know have no use and engaging in a lot of motivated reasoning about the future to justify drawing money in from the outside.Like, it can all be a lot of fun! And some techniques, like all ZK folding schemes, are mathematical magic. But, no one wants code to be law and pretty much no one should be managing private keys tied to money.It&#x27;s a very cool but failed idea. reply wmf 17 hours agorootparentprevWe just need to find some non-speculative and non-scammy uses for that tech. reply iskander 17 hours agorootparentI think you&#x27;ll see people picking those techniques and using them in a hidden-from-the-user way (like how git and BlueSky use Merkle trees) reply danbruc 17 hours agorootparentCryptocurrencies have not actually invented much new technology, they mostly combined existing ideas in new ways. Merkel trees, for example, are an almost 50 year old idea, zero-knowledge proofs are almost 40 years old, proof of work predates Bitcoin by 15 years which makes it 30 years old. reply iskander 16 hours agorootparentI think the initial impractical prototypes for the core techniques were in the literature for a while but there&#x27;s really no comparison between eg interactive ZK protocols and the succinct non-interactive proofs used by the cryptocurrency folks. The latter are computationally general (you don&#x27;t have to roll a new one for each program) and many orders of magnitude more efficient.I think it&#x27;s important to give the cryptocurrency industry credit for the few corners in which it makes real (theory&#x2F;tooling) contributions even if they&#x27;re motivated by nonsense reply danbruc 16 hours agorootparentI did not want to say that they invented or improved nothing, just that a lot of the building blocks already existed. I just looked this up, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof also seem to have a history back to the late 80s, but if cryptocurrencies gave us some improvements and new ideas that made them more practical, fine, I am not going to complain about that. reply iskander 16 hours agorootparentLike, huge tangible improvements.You can do general purpose programming in all kinds of DSLs and Rust libraries that compiles down to big-but-practical arithmetic circuits and then generate proofs that y=f(x) without revealing x for arbitrary f. That really wasn&#x27;t possible until a few years ago and emerged almost exclusively within the sphere of cryptocurrency-adjacent research. You can also use the succinctness of SNARKs to batch these proofs and shrink the verifier costs to almost nothingIt&#x27;s a cool model for asymmetric computing, with low capacity verifiers collecting results from high capacity provers.

It relies on so many specific assumptions that none of the components make sense when taken out of context. reply grotorea 16 hours agorootparentprevHaven&#x27;t we be trying since the beginning? reply rubatuga 13 hours agorootparentprevDrugs usually aren&#x27;t a scam. reply sneak 14 hours agorootparentprevCheap and safe payments are of tremendous utility.The problem is that anonymous payments are essentially illegal under current regulations designed to protect the large incumbent businesses.Cryptocurrencies could render paywalls and signupwalls a thing of the past, allowing you to pay a fraction of a penny for a page view automatically in browser without an account.Such systems are illegal. reply eigenket 14 hours agorootparentThere are some pretty big, obvious reason why true anonymous payments are illegal under a lot of regulations in different countries. Supporting current big businesses is pretty damn far down the list. reply sneak 14 hours agorootparentYes, the reasons are big, but they aren&#x27;t valid or useful unless you are a large incumbent (or the state itself). reply callalex 13 hours agorootparentprevAny payment that can’t be reversed after a dispute is inherently unsafe. reply Zetobal 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a decade now and there is still no real use case for it.. reply danbruc 15 hours agorootparentOne and a half decades actually. reply Demotomo 14 hours agorootparentprevYour zero knowledge proof is not true.We see the issues with it: 1. It moves the trust issue or 2. The trust is only on the Blockchain.World exists in a physical world which doesn&#x27;t allow you at all to use a Blockchain there.And zero trust for your money also means zero recovery reply anon84873628 16 hours agoparentprevAll the grifters and dilettantes moved on to AI :) reply SagatPetchy 17 hours agoparentprevCrypto has always had extreme bull and bear markets. During bear markets the speculators leave, crypto&#x27;s detractors once again proclaim its demise, and its believers anxiously wait for the next bull market. reply kinakomochidayo 10 hours agoparentprevJust getting started with cryptocurrency I would say. Bitcoin Spot ETFs decisions being delayed by SEC, Ether Futures ETFs were just approved by SEC. Crypto will likely be part of our everyday lives eventually, we just won’t know it. reply nebula8804 16 hours agoparentprevMy thinking has always been that Bitcoin can solve the issue of continued printing of fiat money. Bitcoin and other crypto clearly introduces other problems but this fundamental weakness of fiat currency is still there and unsolved. Will bitcoin&#x2F;crypto really go away if this issue with fiat currency is still unresolved? reply adultorata 5 hours agorootparentCheck out Ampleforth, a perfect elastic supply, if Bitcoin had oracles in 2008, then the protocol would&#x27;ve behaved as AMPL reply kinakomochidayo 10 hours agorootparentprevBitcoin has a critical issue looming with the security budget, as each halvening means less revenue for miners, and miners don’t get enough transaction fees to incentivize running ASIC mining farms. reply astrange 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can print new crypto by forking an existing chain, because if it suddenly gets a ton of new users, none of them have any reason to respect what the slow database says the current ones belong to.Meanwhile, printing fiat money isn&#x27;t a problem and is in fact the reason the system works. Crypto users and Austrians are deluded about the purpose of money, which is to facilitate transactions and not to keep score. reply thrawa8387336 15 hours agoparentprevThe genie is out of the box. How would 2008 have played out if Bitcoin existed back then? reply nikanj 15 hours agoparentprevGrifters moved on to AI, leaving only the actually viable parts of crypto around. So yeah cryptos are 100% dead. reply rwmj 18 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;B98v5 reply thelock85 18 hours agoprevSerious question from a crypto outsider: is four months long enough to deter future grifts? Will Zhu’s detention increase likelihood of further prosecutions? reply eigenket 18 hours agoparentSpending 4 months anywhere in Singapore without air-conditioning would deter me from pretty much anything. I imagine the experience in a prison cell is worse. reply lamida 16 hours agorootparentChannel News Asia produced a really good documentary about Singapore prison: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.channelnewsasia.com&#x2F;watch&#x2F;inside-maximum-securit.... reply mikhailfranco 17 hours agorootparentprevThe prison is next to the airport - both named Changi after the original kampong village nearby.So hot, humid and noisy. reply eigenket 14 hours agorootparentInteresting fact, Changi was a fairly brutal prisoner of war camp where allied forces were kept by the Japanese during world war 2. My grandfather&#x27;s brother was kept there during the war. reply lokar 18 hours agoparentprevI read this as not about running a scam, but failing to help the people dealing with the cleanup with their work. A sort of procedural sanction. reply yieldcrv 18 hours agoparentprev> after he failed to comply with court orders to cooperate with the liquidation investigation.this procedural issue isn’t really related to cryptoits someone that didnt show up reply mpweiher 17 hours agorootparentWell...usually it is the procedure of finding out what exactly they did wrong, which tends to have something to do with them running away from that particularly procedure. reply yieldcrv 17 hours agorootparentyeah I think we all got that reply dist-epoch 16 hours agoprevIt was very profitable to trade AGAINST his recommendations. Because he would use his Twitter followers as exit liquidity. When he was praising bitcoin he was secretly selling, and when when he was saying crypto is done, time to get a McDonalds job you knew he was loading up. reply pizzalife 18 hours agoprevThis is very satisfying. reply jiveturkey 14 hours agoprevsorry. nothing to see here. 4 months for failure to testify. not related to crypto fraud etc. reply 1letterunixname 15 hours agoprevThe stupidity of cryptobros remaining in countries where they can be arrested or deported, and of their misinvesting the funds of powerful people. Unfortunately, a free society must permit stupid to be stupid until they break the law.Another issue is the teams who put together these crypto utopias make themselves easy prey by shrewd grifters who are able to execute scams through creative misuse.
