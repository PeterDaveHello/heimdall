A lot of these programs somehow only manage to have 1-2 standard c #include lines. How often do you see that? I also love how, out of 20,000 lines of C code, there only exists 24 #if statements. This is how C programming was meant to be. Reading codebases like this is one of the things I drew inspiration from when I started working on Cosmopolitan Libc. reply cdchn 13 hours agoparentIf your build targets are 1 then that saves you a lot of #if macros. reply lovasoa 13 hours agorootparentYou are replying to someone who builds C programs for 6 OS and 2 architectures without an #if ;) reply DiggyJohnson 11 hours agorootparentLove a great “do you know who you’re dealing with” HN moment.Justine’s APE [0] project is one of the few things to induce in me true, nostalgic, nerdful glee in the last few years.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;ape.html reply johnnyanmac 11 hours agorootparentAhh geez. I see stuff like this going on in the background and I wonder what I&#x27;m even doing in my life, pushing pencils in comparison to actually, truly solving problems.I&#x27;d love to tackle more stuff like this, but I feel trapped chasing what I need to pay the bills (said pencil pushing).At the same time, companies seem so quick to layoff that I question how I even grow to the point where I&#x27;d be trusted with such problems. Do I really just need to do a 2nd full time duty in the open source community to get that growth? reply wahnfrieden 11 hours agorootparentGo indie on the side then full time reply johnnyanmac 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve definitely thought about it and I imagine it&#x27;s my end game. But I&#x27;m hesitant if I&#x27;m truly ready and have the right skills for that. Would that self growth be better than contributing to something larger first (perhaps building more connections on the way)? reply NetOpWibby 1 hour agorootparentAt some point, you’re just gonna have to go for it. Jump in and see what happens. reply reactordev 7 hours agorootparentprevany skills you lack you can hire for. Do it! reply wahnfrieden 7 hours agorootparentprevContributing to OS I’m not sure what that’s a path to exactly reply johnnyanmac 4 hours agorootparentThere&#x27;s Many intentions behind it. In rough order of importance;- working on a medium-large repo size exercises more skills than just jumping into anything alone. Growth is my biggest factor for the next few years.- OS introduces me to a community of passionate devs. Who can be anything from mentors to expand my horizons, to friends to future contacts.- I&#x27;d choose to contribute to tools I would probably use for my own projects. So I can dig into repos early and know it intimately for the time I&#x27;d need to branch for my own project- potential clout in certain communities can open other doors.- Resume material is never bad if everything else falls throughIt&#x27;s not my end game but I think it&#x27;ll help in many ways. And Personally I always had a certain respect for the OS community and want to give back, and hopefully pay if forward. . replydigging 11 hours agorootparentprevOk but sidenote, that Greek-letter titling is emotionally upsetting, even if the title is SR-accessible (κύδος for that though). reply violiner 11 hours agorootparentYeah I read it as \"Astmally pdrtable echesmtable\".

They also boot from the BIOS. Please note this is intended for people who don&#x27;t care about desktop GUIs, and just want stdio and sockets without devops toilthey also boot from the BIOS.... does this mean that I can achieve my dream of booting straight into a BBC BASIC emulator on bare metal(ish)? reply arendtio 3 hours agorootparentYou might want to take a look at the current no. 2 of the HN best list:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38101613 reply bigbillheck 10 hours agorootparentprevI took a quick look at cosmopolitan.h: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;justine.lol&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;cosmopolitan.h and counted 886 occurrences of \"#if\" (including #if and #ifdef) reply jart 3 hours agorootparentcosmopolitan.h is a concatenated rollup of hundreds of header files, shipped as part of the \"amalgamation\" variant of our release, and those sub-headers had #ifndef _FOO_H guards at the top and bottom. The rest of the #ifs are required by standards so we don&#x27;t clobber the user&#x27;s control of their namespace, e.g. `#ifndef _GNU_SOURCE`. What you won&#x27;t see is the annoying stuff that checks for CPU, OSes, endianness, etc. reply yjftsjthsd-h 10 hours agorootparentprevIn fairness, my understanding is that APE manages that by making the differences invisible to the application. I&#x27;m not sure whether that makes it more or less applicable. (More impressive, obviously, but not simpler) reply cdchn 9 hours agorootparentprevThen you can appreciate how many #if macros it would save if you just targeted 1. ;) reply ramilefu 8 hours agorootparentSounds like it wouldn’t save them a single #if, if they are already at 0… reply themerone 9 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t count if all your platform code is abstracted away by libraries. reply duskwuff 13 hours agoparentprev> A lot of these programs somehow only manage to have 1-2 standard c #include linesOlder C compilers will let you get away with a lot of sins which a modern C compiler will (correctly) call you out for. reply jart 13 hours agorootparentWe can still get away with those sins today if you change C&#x27;s implicit type from int to long. I modified chibicc to do just that it was a 1 LOC patch. Suddenly I didn&#x27;t need prototypes anymore and everything just worked without #include lines. reply duskwuff 13 hours agorootparent> Suddenly I didn&#x27;t need prototypes anymoreUnder some very old C standards, maybe. But C99 requires that you at least declare a function before calling it. reply jart 3 hours agorootparent> C99 requires that you at least declare a function before calling itWhere is that written? Please quote the standard. My reading of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9899:TC3 is that Foreword says (paraphrasing) \"hey, we removed implicit int and implicit prototypes from the standard\". So they simply stopped specifying it, but as far as I can tell, the standard says nothing about forbidding them. From my point of view, that means compilers are free to still implement implicit types as a compiler extension to the language, and everyone does, because that extension is needed in order to support the older c89 standard. It would only impact people who want to be able to claim their codebase is c99 standard compliant, because you can&#x27;t do that if you depend on compiler extensions. reply billfruit 7 hours agorootparentprevBut why does it have to be that way though, can&#x27;t the compiler scan the rest of the code&#x2F;files and see if a defenition&#x2F;declaration is present somewhere?There is no such requirement of a declaration before first call in Java for example? reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s because the C compiler was designed to be single pass, so as to be speedy and require less memory on the systems of it&#x27;s time. reply billfruit 1 hour agorootparentIs that a requirement that is relevant presently? I would say not so much. Do modern C compilers also make only a single pass? reply dheera 4 hours agorootparentprevI suppose you could just create a \".d\" file standard that doesn&#x27;t have that requirement but processes into a \".c\" file that has the necessary prototypes. You could probably also auto-insert all the #if&#x27;n&#x27;def nonsense automatically and skip it in the \".d\" files.Kind of like how the JavaScript dudes all use this \".ts\" stuff now for convenience that processes into \".js\" reply Gibbon1 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat I understand is the preprocessor causes issues where you could do that maybe 99.9% of the time, especially with well written code. But it&#x27;d fail that 0.1% of the time.You do have analyses like ctags. In theory the compiler could use ctags to find definitions in source code. My experience is ctags can get confused. It&#x27;s possible in a set of files to have multiple implementations of a function and ctags can&#x27;t tell which one is used. And I see cases where it can&#x27;t find definitions.Personally I&#x27;d be happy if the compiler tried to find a missing definition using ctags and issued a warning.I have wondered if adding funct, public, private keywords to the language might allow the compiler to reliably find function and stuct definitions in source files. reply reactordev 7 hours agorootparentprevThe fact that I&#x27;m calling a function, it must exist, otherwise the compiler will throw an error (\"undefined reference to function\"). So forward declarations is just needless typing. reply duskwuff 4 hours agorootparent> The fact that I&#x27;m calling a function, it must existThat&#x27;s not necessarily true. It&#x27;s possible that the symbol is a function pointer; calling a function pointer requires slightly different code generation. Compare the generated code between: void fn(void); void call_fn(void) { fn(); }and void (*fn_ptr)(void); void call_fn_ptr(void) { fn_ptr(); }In practice, it&#x27;s probably a function, and that&#x27;s what the compiler assumes if there&#x27;s no declaration to go off of. But we all know what happens when you make assumptions. reply reactordev 4 hours agorootparentMaking no assumption on safety, just stating that forward declarations are superfluous. reply fsckboy 2 hours agorootparentno they are not. but >The fact that I&#x27;m calling a function, it must exist, otherwise the compiler will throw an error (\"undefined reference to function\")you mean the linker will throw an error. The linker is trying to link together the \"references\" be they forward or backward, that the compiler has created, and the compiler needs to have generated the right references, round peg round hole, square peg square hole.You don&#x27;t want your linker throwing errors, it doesn&#x27;t have the context the compiler does; and you don&#x27;t want to turn the linker into ChatGPT that can converse with you about your source code, just use the C version of forward references which are not particularly forward, they just say \"I don&#x27;t know where this is defined, it&#x27;s just not defined here, but we know it&#x27;s a square peg\"For example, there are architectures where space is tight (embedded for example) and nearby things can be called more efficiently than far away things, so the compiler needs to generate as many near calls as it can, falling back to far away when it has to. It doesn&#x27;t know in advance how far away things are going to be, but it might uncover plenty of near things as it goes. Square pegs, round pegs.when you recompile your project code, the library code, is not necessarily around. When other people recompile their library code, your project code isn&#x27;t around. What&#x27;s the size of what&#x27;s being put on the stack? Still gotta get the square&#x2F;round pegs right. replyeVeechu7 8 hours agorootparentprevA little bit of advice like that is a tremendous blessing to those of us who just need to touch C occasionally. reply trealira 13 hours agorootparentprevI haven&#x27;t looked that deeply, but I don&#x27;t see many sins in this source code, either, except for the K&R style, weird formatting and doing too much in one line, like this line in the file CAT.C: if(*(Ptr = argv[i]) == &#x27;-&#x27;) {Older C compilers did let you get away with more, like using integers as pointers, and dereferencing pointers as though they were struct pointers when they aren&#x27;t. But I don&#x27;t see that in this code. reply duskwuff 12 hours agorootparentThe \"sin\" I was referring to was calling undeclared functions -- which is how there are so few #include directives in much of this code. Most of the files I looked at include(probably required for variadic arguments on printf-type functions) and(for the FILE type), and call other functions blindly. reply trealira 12 hours agorootparentThat does make sense. My bad, I should have looked closer and noticed the implicitly defined functions.It&#x27;s not even a good idea to do that on modern computers, because implicitly declared functions do type promotions from float to double and char&#x2F;short to int, and on the System V ABI, it has to pass in the number of floating point arguments there are in register eax. reply jart 12 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not a good idea to do that in production code. FTFY. If you&#x27;re writing research, experimental, or one-off programs then it can be a real productivity boon. I say do it for fun. You have a right to enjoy yourself and it&#x27;ll still come out 10x more readable than Perl at the end of the day, let&#x27;s be real. reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparent> it&#x27;ll still come out 10x more readable than Perl at the end of the day, let&#x27;s be real.A low bar, really :-P reply queuebert 9 hours agorootparentprevWait til you see old Fortran codes. reply flykespice 9 hours agorootparentprevHmm implicit int conversion reply marcus0x62 9 hours agoparentprevMeanwhile, over here in the Rust mines, I wrote a simple program that is little more than an http listener with a single route.Cargo pulled in something like 105 dependencies to build it.Although, as an apples to apples comparison, it does only have 2 use statements. reply tubthumper8 9 hours agorootparentIn case you want to create a simple http listener without dependencies (besides the standard library), the official Rust Book has a tutorial for just that: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch20-01-single-threaded.html reply marcus0x62 8 hours agorootparentI’m aware, but thank you. reply mianos 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd, the meme, for every comment in C or C++ on HN, there is one \"but Rust\". reply ccozan 1 hour agorootparentwe should turn it into a law or somthing... reply lrvick 9 hours agorootparentprevThis is a culture problem, not a language problem.Here is a http health check in 19 lines using only the rust standard library.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dpaste.org&#x2F;f895z reply marcus0x62 8 hours agorootparentThere’s a lot of distance between “reinvent the wheel by implementing all your network functionality using nothing more than sockets” and “download 100 libraries to serve a file over http”.There’s a happy medium to be had.I’d also disagree this is not at all a language problem - I think it’s both, in that the language has moved an awful lot of core functionality into the crate ecosystem, where there are a bewildering array of options for almost any need. The resulting explosion in the dependency graph is an entirely foreseeable consequence — partially of that language design decision and partially due to the “npm culture” (for lack of a better description.) reply kqr 3 hours agorootparentSlighly off topic, but... how is npm culture different from CPAN culture? I have a feeling there is a difference but I&#x27;m too unfamiliar with both ecosystems to point it out. reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparentprevSure, if you are putting in a health check and nothing else, that&#x27;s fine. When you need to parse headers, negotiate content types, validate maximum lengths on requests, properly log the source of the request (it&#x27;s not just the connecting IP if there&#x27;s a load balancer in front of it), parsing request bodies, dealing with range requests, authentication, cookies, providing a good middleware mechanism...The list goes on. While I&#x27;m not a Rust developer, there&#x27;s probably hundreds of libraries because the problem is structured into a lot of small parts, and frameworks are expected to be able to satisfy the functionality you expect without needing to bypass it. reply rezonant 7 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn&#x27;t really surprise me, doing an HTTP service correctly is not actually trivial reply throwaway892238 8 hours agoparentprevOTOH, here is a hash table in C implemented entirely as macros.

I sometimes use 7=TRUE as thats 3 bits with no more chars to type (and of course foolish as such a 1 bit hardware error would \"trash\" pretty much any system - but I do tend to be a creature of habit :)I have never heard of this convention before! Was \"random bitflips messing with your conditionals\" a common problem back in the day? reply LastTrain 10 hours agoparentNo, and the author basically admitted it was silly. My counter would be that it makes the intent less clear. I loved reading through his style doc though and I love that he just threw all this stuff out there. Something in his collection is bound to scratch somebody’s itch. reply jareklupinski 13 hours agoparentprevtangential to &#x27;how can a bit be wrong&#x27;, when trying to see if a serial data line is working, i write 0xA5 ( 1010 0101 ) to send an alternating bitstream with a twist so i can test the greatest number of things i think can be wrong at once reply genter 12 hours agorootparentExcept that if you have the bit endian wrong, 0xA5 is the same forward and backward. reply jareklupinski 12 hours agorootparentthat&#x27;s true! 0xAA 0x55 would work to differentiate that case? reply MadnessASAP 12 hours agorootparentYes, AA and 55 are common test patterns for a variety of hardware.Haven&#x27;t seen A5 in the wild but I suppose it could be useful as a initial \"Let&#x27;s setup a connection\" where endianness is unknown. Assuming the next thing that is exchanged is an endian negotiation. reply genter 10 hours agorootparentprevI like to have several sequential ones. Easier to see on the oscilloscope. (I spent last night getting a microcontroller to talk to a SPI device, so I&#x27;m still licking my wounds.) reply ahoka 1 hour agorootparentprevEndianness is byte order. reply UweSchmidt 10 hours agorootparentprevHow would a HNer who&#x27;s not familiar in those nether regions of computing, but wants to feel the excitement of sending a bitstream over a (possibly faulty!) serial data line, get started? Two Arduinos and a cable maybe? reply robocat 9 hours agorootparentPersonally I would recommend finding fun or useful projects where you have an outcome you really desire. Start simple - one sensor like a bath overflow warner (arduino is good or maybe raspberry pi).Learning hardware just for the sake of it is tough to keep motivated and perhaps you would never use the skills you learn? Hardware adds a tougher level to debugging - but software experience gives you a fantastic start - a logical mind and rational drilling down.If you can fix your car you have the skills to start on electronics!A lot of skilled people grew up through the hardware generations e.g. I began learning basic electronics because on an Apple ][ everything was simpler and we were all at the same stage. My first job was writing low level serial driver code and regularly dealing with serial devices (e.g. on PC). Our modern context is just not the same. The internet is hard to learn from. It is difficult to write good articles to help - the experienced like me just know a huge variety of implicitly learned knowledge.I suggest you concentrate on a useful or fun outcome - I believe it&#x27;s good life practice (and good engineering) to stay focused on the outcome and not get too side-tracked by explicitly trying to learn. We implicitly learn just by doing! reply benj111 1 hour agorootparent>If you can fix your car you have the skills to start on electronics!I&#x27;d like to think that this is a comment on the ease of fixing cars, rather than a comment about how fixing cars is basically embedded hardware&#x2F;software dev.... reply jareklupinski 10 hours agorootparentprevyup that&#x27;s what I was building :)i was sending pixel data out from an Arduino (ESP32 really but using Arduino IDE) to a bunch of shift registers that seemed to be 74x595 (but couldnt know for sure) to resurrect an LED display for a local art project, and reading the data coming back out from the last register let me know I was at least getting back what I was putting in, which helped me troubleshoot a few wire length and speed&#x2F;stability issuesto get started with electronics and hardware in general, I wrote a short tutorial: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35116705 reply UweSchmidt 10 hours agorootparentThat tutorial of yours is a lot more than I expected to get out of my question, such a cool first project! Thanks! reply Muromec 8 hours agorootparentprevEsp32 is the cool arduino. reply turndown 9 hours agorootparentprevThe way that really clarified things for me was buying a 3d printer(an Ender 3 for me) and a Raspberry Pi. Setting it up and flashing a new OS to it should basically teach you the rudimentary workings of the hardware->software interface. reply kqr 3 hours agoparentprevEven if it was, are you really going to think of every conditional as a tri-state boolean?Or will you assume that one of the branches is safe to execute during failure?Or will you count the number of bits in each conditional and assume more ones than zeroes is a true, with no error correction? Will you log that a bit has flipped or otherwise alert the operator? Will you consider that as evidence that an int has changed value too?Will you store ints with three bits per bits also?Error detecting codes have their place, but it takes more than just saying that true is 7. reply dboreham 13 hours agoparentprevNo. Random bitflips (aka hardware that doesn&#x27;t work) are a relatively new thing. Bit flips due to buggy software was a thing though. This is why most database engines checksum the payload data even in memory. I&#x27;ve also seen network packets corrupted because a bridge (former name for switch) trashed data in flight, then reconstructed its CRC for the corrupt data on the onward leg. reply ziddoap 12 hours agorootparent>Random bitflips (aka hardware that doesn&#x27;t work) are a relatively new thingThis implies that old hardware always worked, which I strongly doubt (what year did hardware go from always working to not?). reply ChrisSD 1 hour agorootparent1993 reply bernds74 13 hours agorootparentprevI beg to differ. Early 90s there were some Amiga memory expansions that would constantly flip bits. I&#x27;m pretty sure it contributed to the sentiment that the system wasn&#x27;t the most stable, although I&#x27;m pretty sure one or two of my friends with PCs saw similar issues on their machines. Maybe Microsoft Word wasn&#x27;t to blame for all the crashes?Of course, trying to work around it in software is utterly futile. reply dragonwriter 10 hours agorootparentprev> Random bitflips (aka hardware that doesn&#x27;t work) are a relatively new thing.I thought they (from cosmic rays, etc.) were always a thing, but so rare that you needed a very large system (in scope or time or both) to have a substantial chance of encountering one (outside of noisy comm channels, which use error correction protocols for exactly that reason.) reply defrost 43 minutes agorootparentSome event (unknown) triggered multiple spikes in the \"tell me three times\" redundant three ADIRU units of Qantas Flight 72 causing a WTF unscheduled sudden and dramatic pitch downhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Qantas_Flight_72#ConclusionCosmic rays were suspected but unconfirmed (kind of hard to confirm after the fact).\"All the aircaft in the world\" for sixty years is kind of a large system given that currently there are on the order of one million people in the air at any moment. reply indymike 11 hours agorootparentprevBitflips aren’t a new thing.

I observed bitflips a couple decades ago, causing machine to panic. reply layer8 12 hours agoparentprevNo, this is more a case of “this could conceivably happen, so why not guard against it where it’s easy to do”. Though personally I would have used -1. reply adrianmsmith 1 hour agorootparentThe BBC micro and Archimedes used -1 as true in BASIC.It meant that you didn&#x27;t need the distinction of \"logical operators\" (like && in C) and \"bitwise operators\" (like & in C). You could just use bitwise operators, e.g. the bitwise NOT operator would convert 0 (all bits clear) was -1 (all bits set) so there was no need for \"logical operators\".I always felt that was more elegant than C (but of course required a two&#x27;s compliment machine, which BBC&#x2F;Archimedes was, but C didn&#x27;t require). reply wrs 13 hours agoparentprevI’ve been involved with systems where 0xffff… was canonical “true”, but not something as specific as 7! If you’re going to turn on more bits, why not all of them? Though I think this was because the NOT instruction was used for logical inversion, so the bit flip theory doesn’t apply. reply cpeterso 13 hours agorootparentFor example, the value of Visual Basic&#x27;s \"True\" keyword is -1. This seems silly from the perspective of a C programmer, but -1 (0xffffffff) is \"more true\" than 1 because every bit is true, not just the LSB. :)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;visual-basic&#x2F;langua... reply bilekas 12 hours agorootparentEven in VB there is a grain of rationale ..

And there&#x27;s little to be done about it.Unless you can stop cosmic rays.Luckily it doesn&#x27;t happen THAT often. I forget the exact metric but I recall various Google Engineers saying that something like one out of a million test run failures is a random bitflip? reply eichin 13 hours agorootparentCosmic rays were a theory in 70&#x27;s era hardware for failures that ended up being proven to be particles emitted by the ceramic packaging itself. (Modern bitflips are have more to do with component sizes several orders of magnitude smaller.) (edit: not saying that cosmic rays aren&#x27;t a problem now, just that they only became a problem as chip element sizes shrunk, and they&#x27;re probably not the only source.)Also, you can definitely stop cosmic rays, that was part of how they eliminated them as the source. reply Supermancho 12 hours agorootparent> Also, you can definitely stop cosmic raysAs I understand it, bit flipping in RAM is mitigated by error correction, via auxilliary and redundant bits.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dynamic_random-access_memory#R... reply buildbot 11 hours agorootparentprevI swear there was a google paper about using a DC as a really bad particle detector, but I can’t find :&#x2F; reply scottlamb 12 hours agoparentprev> I have never heard of this convention before!

Yes, it saves you if you have a boolean variable... maybe? if (var == TRUE) ; &#x2F;&#x2F; It was 7 else if (var == FALSE) ; &#x2F;&#x2F; it was zero else ??? what do I do here?And you need to solve that \"what do I do here\" for every single conditional on a boolean, and have the extra lines of code to handle it and not crash.But, you know, what if it was a variable that you used in a switch statement instead? Or just \"if (i > 17)\"? Bit flips can affect your logic all over the place, not just when it&#x27;s a boolean variable.And then, if a bit flip can affect a boolean, it can also affect a pointer. Or the return address on the stack (or the link to the previous stack frame).Or it can flip a bit in the code.So this is, at best, a very very partial solution, and it&#x27;s non-trivial to implement.

Sadly, it almost never happens. It just goes to show the importance of open sourcing what you can, as you can (in other words, \"now or never\"). But it&#x27;s a lot more work to do that than people imagine, even when they say \"well just release it in the least polished form possible.\" You&#x27;ve still gotta deal with adding a new boundary to your codebase, which not only requires additional effort but also increases complexity of the wider project and makes it impossible to refactor without first refactoring a cascade of miniprojects you&#x27;ve created within it. reply josephg 8 hours agorootparentI often think of source code like moulding clay. While you’re actively working in a codebase, the clay is moist and malleable. Making changes is easy, because the context of what it does, and how it’s organised is fresh in your mind.But if you move on to another project and let time pass, the clay dries out and becomes brittle. When you open the project up again, it takes time to “wet the clay” - and remember all that context that you’ve forgotten. It’s easy to add bugs, or reimplement methods that already exist somewhere else under a different name. But over time, you work water into the clay and it becomes malleable again.I agree with your comment. Refactoring software to split out libraries that you can opensource is a lot of work. More work than people realise. But if you think refactoring is a lot of work when the clay is wet, it’ll be many times harder if you let the clay dry first. Refactoring as you work is always the best way, because it’s often the only way to get it done. replynihiven 13 hours agoprevThis is really cool.

There is no single proper way to share code, least using a commercial platform(s). reply rijoja 9 hours agorootparentprevPersonally I&#x27;ve become sceptical towards github since Microsoft took over it, and it&#x27;s surprising to me that the open source community is so happy to use it in light of Microsoft&#x27;s history of trying to fight open source.Of course there would be a lot of reasons to use github, which I&#x27;ll refrain from attempting to list since I&#x27;m not really an expert of that particular subject, but those benefits has to be weighed against handing over the control of such vast amounts of data to a huge corporation which I&#x27;d think its safe to say, primarily would be interested in profit and survival, rather than the wellbeing of the open source community. One might for instance consider the possibly of the data being used to train an AI, which in itself isn&#x27;t necessary a bad thing, but that still raises some questions. Apart from that relying on github&#x27;s, might lead to vendor lock in, and it might also mean that the processes that gets used to develop projects falls under control of a in a best case scenario selfish actor and in a worst case scenario a hostile one.Perhaps you are familiar with the \"embrace, extend and extinguish\" strategy that Microsoft has been accused of employing? Things like these doesn&#x27;t really inspire trust in the company&#x27;s intention towards free software. Due to the size of the company, they are also capable of influencing the industry at large through various means, for instance via expensive advertisement campaigns, and to selling their solution to existing clients. So for instance they could create software such as VS Code and Teams, which would argubly be more or less copies of existing software, using their sizable pool of developers and then use it&#x27;s huge marketing machinery to take over the market.Even tough the open source community seems to be flourishing at the moment, there would be threats looming on the horizon. For instance the question of how to relate to service providers who can profit off of open source code, without really having to share back since the code is running solely on their own servers, another one being that open source code gets used to build closed solutions with the help of AI.Personally I appreciate projects, that distribute code in the old-fashioned ways, which has proven to be successful in countless cases, and I would like to ask open source creators to consider the alternatives, and how they would fit in with the goals of the project. A lot of times I bet github still would be a good fit, but at the same time I&#x27;m sure that there are good ideas that could be implemented outside of those parameters. reply dboreham 9 hours agorootparentprevPeople can poke around in it more easily.

These are countered by self-hosting your repo in your own (home&#x2F;cloud) server.Downside of self-hosting is time, money and effort.

    "title": "YouTube Personality Creates Decoy Platform to Entrap Bitcoin Scammers: Collaboration with Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken Emerges",
    "originLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWzz3NeDz3E",
    "originBody": "there are scammers everywhere from YouTube comments to phone calls I even have scammers pretending to be me at this point yeah my name is kid kid buger doing how many video how many videos have you made now kid and my YouTube videos are many I don't even know why do you wear the glasses though the glasses are really I think the glasses are like offputting they're kind of ugly if I want to do something to fight back there is not enough time in the day for me to just talk to all of them myself so my team and I built a trap that would keep them occupied even while I sleep welcome to the easy send automated system our award-winning platform is set up to allow anyone with a code to easily withdraw and manage funds the concept's pretty simple I give a scammer a fake Bitcoin gift card or receipt and they think it's going to be easy to redeem in their mind it's a board game with no obstacles or challenges and free Bitcoin in the end they've already won but in reality my team and I have designed a series of challenges and obstacles that make this literally impossible just one last thing how would you rate your experience today goodbye that guy has spent over 5 days playing I was not expecting that that's five time 24 we're talking real life days this scammer is so convinced he's going to get this fake Bitcoin that he once visited the website 40 days in a row because he truly believed he was going to get Bitcoin that doesn't exist we we built the ultimate mouse trap well scammer trap and they're obviously not playing a board game like this he's been sucked into to this fake Bitcoin themed website where we log every little interaction every day when this guy gets on the website we keep track of exactly what he does what support tickets he tries to open what capses he has to solve what loading bars he has to painstakingly wait for and at no point will he ever receive Bitcoin this isn't just one scammer it's hundreds of scammers and over the past few months I am happy to report that we've been able to waste 60 days worth of their time 1,440 hours are gone they will never get that time back they have been sucked into this lie thinking the Bitcoin they stole is this close but they are never going to get it it literally doesn't exist and I want to show this to you but I have to give you a little context lately scammers have been using Bitcoin ATM machines as an easy way to take money from their victims once you insert cash you can send money directly to their wallet and it happens pretty quickly at the end they ask you for a receipt because sometimes they have to verify a few things it typically has a QR code we've done all kinds of stuff to make them angry like pretending we completed the maze But ultimately the scam ends when they get this receipt and that got us wondering what if the 18 00 number on the back of a gift card or the QR code on a receipt took them to our website what if we trick them into registering an account with a phone system that keeps them on hold forever just because they think they're about to get Bitcoin well that's what I told my team anyway and then we built it okay they you have to on this number won receive okay yeah you want me to hang up is that what you said no no I don't want you to hang up no no I want you to be online hang up don't hang up yes okay yes don't hang up oh he's we're in nothing just come back home and keep me on the line all right he's on the website he entered the code keep me on the line don't hang up one of the first obstacles we built for scammers was this fake capture system that uses AI generated art if scammers want to claim their Bitcoin they would have to pass this test in order to log in 50% of the time the scammers would lose literally like it's it's just a 50-50 shot a scammer pretending to be Keo Reeves saw this picture when asked how many nuts there were he responded it is uncountable or another scammer was asked to estimate the wave's height in meters and simply responded 32 ft some crypto recovery scammer said it was a beam balance or or balance beam clearly has no idea what this thing is most of these captures are open-ended like which car is the fastest is it the pink one the green car the red car which frankly I'm not even sure is a car we asked scammers what the dice roll was and the fake Elon Musk wrote 8 and then 1,232 then followed by 1,322 we accepted that answer but it makes no sense how many nuts do you see one nut no nut these nuts no I'm kidding the scammer wrote two nuts which I don't know how you get that answer reminds me of this fake crypto scammer who said I don't play chess in between the capses we would put obnoxiously long loading bars and by the time they finally get to their online dashboard and their account is registered they could have easily wasted 10 15 minutes at this point a scammer is eager to put in their Bitcoin wallet because they're anticipating a huge payout but every time we tell them that there's an error oh man I guess you can't withdraw your Bitcoin that easily but thankfully we have customer service representative standing by 247 if you can navigate our phone tree option five I didn't understand please listen carefully is five I didn't understand option five I didn't understand to claim pH like at one point it asks you to verify the code on the receipt and no matter what you say we always get it wrong and tell you that you have to talk to a human your current wait time is between 10 and 19 minutes there are 13 callers ahead of you you're then told that you're like fifth in line and maybe your estimated wait time is 10 minutes but there is no one waiting for you so you enter into this queue with whole music really good hold music and every few minutes in order to make sure that they're paying attention and not just putting the phone on speaker we ask them to say something ridiculous please let me know you're still there by saying colorful comrade colorful comrade buttered bicycle mot mot bicycle friendly Furniture friendly Furniture I'm still here okay you gu are making me go crazy to prevent automated calls I'm still here I'm

were only supposed to be on the phone with five minutes for five minutes do you want to do this right or do you want to go back to the gauntlet like it's up to you oh okay I want to do this right so how going to do this right how we doing it right please it looks like your longest hold time was 1 hour and 10 minutes are you are you willing to beat that record today yeah that that that better but can can I can I get you pass nor cycle with you have for a proper guide after that I put him back on hold and he waited 3 hours for nothing we recently started asking scammers to verify their Human by drawing things I'm just curious what do you think this is if you guessed a worm lifting up a rock you'd be wrong if you guess snake with an afro you'd be close it's actually supposed to be snake wearing a hat but your few scammers did a decent job with they're not terrible one's kind of cute we ask them to draw these images and it's just a 50/50 chance to get it right or wrong so this guy was supposed to draw a cube I don't know what these things are are but they're for sure not 3D cubes what do you think this is a cute little mouse it's supposed to be a rat remember these are multiple scammers trying to draw a rat to prove their human to get Bitcoin that doesn't exist it's absolutely absurd this is a crow lifting weights and here's some robots you get the idea one scammer wrote to us saying that it is literally impossible to complete the human verification to make things secure for the scammers we told them they would have to set up a passphrase that required random entropy the only way that we could generate this P phrase is if they complete this maze this maze might look simple but it's very hard I spent like 10 minutes trying to do it and I could not complete it myself sometimes we actually have to make it easier for the scammers ask him what the problem is oh what's the hold up is it a server issue is it a courier issue are they are you seeing an error on the page problem could be so right sometimes it's happen people don't take their security quite as seriously as they should well he might not have a mother and we need the mother's made a name that that could be that could be the case did did it ask you for your mother's maiden name no they did not they only say uh make a withraw with your wall do you need help completing the maze or are you going to try to do that on your own time I need help I need help I have not done it before I need help you tell me what what corner of the of the of the Maj you're on yeah describe it to us what does it look like if I was a mouse where's the cheese it took this scammer 127 tries to complete the Maze and then we reset it so he had to do it again at at one point I started telling scammers the best way to withdraw their funds was to put their phone on airplane mode which if you don't know would just make them hang up that's what I'm saying if I put it in air Prem mode I might lost my connection that's why I'm saying not if you do it right air Prem mode is it wait cuz I don't want to lose it on the phone right now sir do you want to follow the steps that I'm trying to help you with or or not I'm just here to help a lot of customers find success switching to airplane mode so that they're not interfering with anything um that's the first step that I'm snorted way to kind of reset all your settings in the in the system here it should be fine okay all right I do I know all right just count down from 10 10 [Music] nine you got to say it out loud though got him okay when we originally designed this it was supposed to be funny and just waste scammers time while I sleep and we've definitely met that goal but a few unexpected things started happening because they trust the system so much they would enter in very valuable wallets sometimes the wallets had hundreds of thousands of dollars passing through them and I would be able to work with kraken's fraud team to investigate and see if we could get things shut down to give you an idea of the scams that were disrupting in reporting over 280 Bitcoin have passed through some of these wallets that's millions of dollars of fraud but that's just the tip of the iceberg one night I received a message from Kraken support telling me that someone had called in asking about their Bitcoin stock and seemed really confused this woman gave Kraken my email address and username at this point we're trying to get in touch with this individual and explain what's going on but she's not answering her phone call until one day the scammer had her call the fake Bitcoin hotline please note that this call is being recorded transfer bit if you not wish to be recorded please hang up at this time transfer Bitcoin an old woman who had been scammed for 6 years called in our system and we were able to walk her through everything that's happened and get her the help that she needed I'm happy that that I can help because they would just keep doing this we'll make sure that none of these guys can get on your computer again um and then we'll sort through what we need to do next since then a few dozen victims here in the US have called in this system and we've been able to help them we've been able to call and explain what's going on with the scams and get them connected to the people that they need locally to pick their lives up again Everything Has Changed what started off is a joke has become very very real I just gave you the history of what's happened with this tool and it has far exceeded my expectations the next handful of videos on the channel are going to walk you through some of the crazy scenarios of scammers that have been in the system and victims that we've been able to save and I this is this has been one of the coolest projects that I've worked on over the past handful of years if anything I hope that this has inspired you to get out there and try stuff this was a random idea that we had that we thought might even be funny and now has turned in to something much bigger than I ever could have imagined and thank you again to the team at Kraken for supporting me and my team to be able to build stuff like this and the fraud team over there to be able to help investigate all of these wallets and scammers that are are coming in it truly means a lot to be able to have a partner like that fighting back against these scammers if you want to learn more about Kraken and their security check out kraken.com Koga until then I hope you have a chance to pursue something that you find meaning in something that you're passionate about because who knows what it will turn into and as always know that you're valuable and that you matter I'll see you in the next video bye",

I know this was set up on purpose but I&#x27;ve had that exact same thing happen to me on a real & important government system recently.I&#x27;ve been trying to call California EDD to get some back pay for my state paid family leave. There is no option to get what I need online, I need to call in. I&#x27;ve had that exact thing happen twice after an hour of waiting in the queue... phone rings, goes to voicemail, full mailbox, line gets disconnected. And I have about a 1&#x2F;100 rate of even getting a chance to join the queue when I call; usually I hear that the queue is too full to join at all. It&#x27;s absolutely maddening and I may never get my PFL paid out properly. reply curun1r 10 hours agoparentFWIW, when I had to get in touch with EDD several years ago and had absolutely no luck calling the main number, I eventually got through with the foreign language numbers. They’re generally staffed higher in proportion to the number of callers they get. IIRC, Vietnamese was the one with the best ratio, though that may have changed in the years since I looked into it.It can be tricky to make it through the automated menus if you don’t speak the language (though I’m sure you’ve memorized the sequence by now), but once you get to a human, they’re bilingual and completely fluent in English. reply Apocryphon 6 hours agorootparentBest hack I’ve read on this site in quite a while! reply dghughes 6 hours agorootparentprevGoogle&#x27;s Translate app on a phone may help but not all languages accept audio input. reply gscott 6 hours agorootparentUsually, the foreign language number staff speak English as well. reply wing-_-nuts 13 hours agoparentprevCalling comcast customer support almost guarantees this happens.

Most recently I preserved the NYT intro rate of $4 every 4 weeks (instead of $25) and I got a 33% discount on an Adobe subscription after they announced a 50% price hike and I started the cancellation process. reply pests 12 hours agorootparentMy uncle calls up all his service providers at least twice a year and threatens to cancel just to see what they offer him. It&#x27;s had a very positive ROI. reply m-p-3 12 hours agorootparentprevYou have to accept that they might actually cancel the account, and deal with the inconvenience of actually switching (which may be worth it anyway). reply johndhi 10 hours agorootparentNot really you can usually back out before finally pulling the trigger. reply ryandrake 5 hours agorootparentI tried that bluff with a cable company once and they put me on hold for a bit, I thought it was to transfer me to retention department so I can get a sweet discount. Then the rep comes back on and said “Ok I canceled your account. Anything else i can do?” reply sgerenser 13 minutes agorootparentYeah this does occasionally happen. Had it happen with a credit card that had hiked their annual fee or something like that. Best to be prepared with a backup service or be OK doing without.I’ve had good luck not specifically saying “I want to cancel” but something along the lines of “I’m thinking about cancelling, the price is just too high” but that doesn’t always get you the very best offers. reply g-b-r 7 hours agorootparentprevComcast specifically though throttled the retention policies for Sky Italia when they bought them, it used to be that you could get a 60% discount easily, after their purchase it became at most 40% if I remember well reply lobocinza 3 hours agorootparentprev> TBH, I kind of dread when they start incorporating LLMs or better ai, because it will be truly impossible to speak to a human anymore.I think my bank did that as the experience looked far from the usual chat bot.

I just looked up who mine was, and they had a section on their website about requesting help with EDD, so it must be something that they hear about often.I basically gave up on calling EDD directly as it&#x27;s just not possible to get through. I did get through to somebody once, in probably over 200 calls, and multiple hour long holds, and it&#x27;s just not feasible to keep trying to make this with my work and my family and everything. You need to make it a full time job if you want to go through that channel. reply jjeaff 6 hours agorootparentthis might not be worth it, depending on where you live, but EDD has physical offices. Where, infuriatingly, you also cannot talk to a real person. they have banks of phones you can pick up and it will dial you in to their call system. I had a family member that tried this and it seemed to fast track him to talking to a real person. My experience with EDD is that you just need to get filed into their system. they will eventually get to it whether it is an appeal or request or whatever, they take months to get back to you, but they do. even if it is because they owe you money. reply dap 11 hours agoparentprevI feel for you about EDD.

Not sure how many people can be waiting but it&#x27;s almost always instantly full.That is the only way I&#x27;ve ever gotten in the queue so far though, calling multiple times right at opening hour. And then once in the queue I see the issue above re: no answer &#x2F; mailbox is full after waiting on hold for ages for my turn.I also have a thing on my phone that automatically pushes the right buttons as fast as possible to navigate to the extension I need (for a more efficient rejection). reply toast0 9 hours agorootparent> I also have a thing on my phone that automatically pushes the right buttons as fast as possible to navigate to the extension I need (for a more efficient rejection).Pushing buttons slowly might work better if fast doesn&#x27;t work. reply Miserlou57 12 hours agoparentprevAs a generally left leaning government trusting Silicon Valley tech bro, the California PFL nightmare has been so awful it has been enough to at least instill thoughts of moving to live off grid in Idaho and starting an anti government … group reply blululu 5 hours agorootparentWanting a large government and wanting a government to work well are not mutually exclusive.

I imagine they have to be like that in order to be able to sleep at night, they justify the scamming by saying (mostly to themselves) things like the West stole from the developing countries, so this is them stealing back, and they have to believe the victims deserve it so they can, I repeat, sleep at night. Another justification might be \"Look at this stupid moron, I won&#x27;t feel bad stealing from them because someone would inevitably do, since they&#x27;re so dumb!\", i.e. they have to believe the victims are dumb in order to convince themselves of the previous sentence.Maybe it&#x27;s a chicken and egg issue though, maybe only scumbag jerkoffs are attracted to this kind of scam-call-center work. Then again maybe most humans are easily manipulable that they go into such a call-center being a decent person and enter into a Stanford Prison Experiment situation... reply JaDogg 12 hours agorootparentYes, they definitely believe the West stole their money. This is what you hear every day from government propaganda (based on personal experience; refer to my other comment on the original post). Breaking out of propaganda is not a simple task for any individual. While the West may have colonized these countries in the past, it is the government and corruption that are currently responsible for the theft. Moreover, people from these countries are exposed to scams from as early as 5-10 years old. Eventually, this exposure leads to normalization, I believe.As a side note, I believe one of the worst outcomes of colonization is that these countries lost their monarchies and lacked a natural progression to diplomacy. The only way for these countries to develop and reduce corruption is through educated youth engaging in politics and joining political parties to a degree where they dilute corruption, similar to how acid is diluted. reply monadINtop 11 hours agorootparent> I believe one of the worst outcomes of colonization is that these countries lost their monarchies and lacked a natural progression to diplomacyI think this is a very loaded and fraught perspective that ignores a large amount of context.Colonial powers generally co-opt local heirarchies and utilise the pre-existing state machinery to expediate the process of resource extraction and pacification since doing it from scratch is usually too costly and prone to instability. In many cases this may inflame pre-existing class confict and further entrench social division. It is rarely the case that pre-colonial power structures simply just vanish and are replaced by the colonial force, and furthermore they don&#x27;t simply vanish post-colonisation leaving behind a template-less society.Ex-colonies don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum. Every society on the face of the earth is embedded in a complex global web of economic and political influence. Post-colonial nations can still be implicitly, and sometimes covertly, subjugated through asymmetric trade agreements, power projection, and a whole range of other processes. It is naive to assign blame of a corrupt or floundering region to a simple moral decay in an isolated system of people that just never figured out how to govern themselves. The answer is found when one instead considers the given region&#x27;s place in the continuum of economic and historic processes that are far too complex to simplify into an narrative independent of context.And finally, how does a monarchy naturally progress to \"diplomacy\"? To my knowledge there doesn&#x27;t exists a single theory that can describe a universal archetype of a how a given human society is supposed to \"naturally\" develop. Even in western countries, the process of economic development from a feudal mode of production to the current capitalist parliamentary-democracy, is an extremely complicated and poorly understood topic that covers an area of research far larger than the scope any single historian or political theorist. Everything we see indicates that there is absolutely no fixed model of social development, especially not one that isn&#x27;t contigent on an unimaginable number of nonlinear factors. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to say that the development of any given society is completely unique to itself, and is the result of it&#x27;s own unique position in relation to the outside world, and to history. reply JaDogg 11 hours agorootparentApologies, I agree with everything you mentioned in your comment.

I thought the idea was that Kitboga and his team pose as marks, send the bogus QR code to the scammer, and that&#x27;s their whole pipeline. How do legitimate people end up in there?2. Assuming the above is something like \"scammers are clearly manipulating scam victims into helping them with the Gauntlet\", doesn&#x27;t that raise questions about the glee with which he, and all of us, are watching \"scammers&#x27;\" frustration? It becomes a more nuanced moral calculus if some number of the people you are frustrating are innocent people manipulated into navigating this system for scammers.

This can be done via a Bitcoin ATM which will then print out a receipt which the scammer asks the victim for a picture of (see [0]).As Kitboga says, the scam normally has to end at this point because the scammer can easily verify whether the receipt is fake or not. So, instead, Kitboga and his team created a fake receipt that takes the scammer to the web and call center labyrinth, promising them they can redeem the Bitcoin at the end.Third party Bitcoin management entities are kind of common now, I guess, so this doesn&#x27;t raise any big red flags?[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dWzz3NeDz3E&t=150s reply KallDrexx 14 hours agorootparentWhy would victims be calling in on the scammer&#x27;s behalf then?

The scammers don&#x27;t currently have pipeline management adequate to know if you&#x27;re really a victim or not.This lets you skip a bunch of the early and failure prone stages (scammers hang up calls eagerly at the beginning if they get the slightest hint you&#x27;re not a real victim) and go right to the end game where things are much more fun and the scammers are much less likely to bail out. reply Ancalagon 15 hours agoprevNot much sympathy for these scammers but I do wonder how desperate some of them have to be to waste so much time on a couple hundred bitcoin max. reply chedabob 14 hours agoparentIn one of the screenshots, Kitboga&#x27;s fake page promises them the equivalent of $11k in BTC.Considering a lot of these scams originate from countries with low wages and high unemployment, not really surprising people would be willing to waste a few days for the promise of a year&#x27;s salary or more. reply josu 12 hours agorootparent>low wages and high unemploymentLow wages sure, but high unemployment is not correct.

A job well done. reply JaDogg 13 hours agoprevKudos to Kitboga!But let&#x27;s really think about it, isn&#x27;t it true that most things in the world are some form of a scam?Growing up in a poor country, I&#x27;ve realized that scams are everywhere, right from the day you start school:1) Parents resort to scamming the school hiring board using fake addresses just to enroll their children in a good school.2) In the early years, students learn how to cheat in exams to survive.3) Teachers unfairly give lower marks to students (or parents) who don&#x27;t buy into their side hustles like private tutoring or educational CDs.4) Movies and music are all pirated, contributing to this cycle of deception.5) Even radio and TV shows shamelessly copy Hollywood productions.6) Need to get something done at a government office? Be prepared to pay bribes.7) If you want to leave the country &#x2F; immigration purposes, you have to navigate a web of bribery and money-grabbing schemes at every level.8) Far-right racism use pseudo-science to deceive people into thinking that the majority is superior.9) There are fake diploma and degree providers scamming people within the same country.10) Interested in day trading? Beware of commission-driven scams and cryptocurrency schemes targeting people from your own country.11) If you need the government to fix a road, you have to approach politicians and plead for something they promised in the first place.12) Even small local shops dilute products, potentially selling toxic items to unsuspecting customers.13) Need water? Attempting to approach politicians is futile. Eventually, the local community took matters into their own hands, establishing a private company to provide water. By the time standard water lines were laid, the locals had already constructed the water tank. (My father played a significant role in this endeavor - the type of person politicians dislike, haha!)14) As elections draw near, there is a sudden decrease in the prices of goods.15) Having trouble conceiving? Thinking of consulting the local guru? Don&#x27;t worry; if your daughter bears a resemblance to the guru, it&#x27;s all good.16) A women fell victim to a cryptobro&#x2F;environmentalist&#x2F;spiritualist&#x2F;influencer scammer. Interestingly, this scammers&#x27;s father is also a con artist who specifically targets older women (he&#x27;s the old school type). (It&#x27;s essential to educate your children about pickup artists and red pill nonsense; unfortunately, these tactics sometimes work and are genuinely dangerous.)---It&#x27;s no surprise that people resort to scams, likely due to a lack of empathy, extreme cynicism, narcissistic personality disorder, or some combination thereof. Extracting individuals from this mindset requires significant effort. reply montag 11 hours agoparentSounds like you are talking about a very specific place.

SHAWN NOV 2, 2023 15 Share Every profession has its own dance with disaster. Physicians’ diagnosis, accountants’ audit, and writers? They proofread. But for us software developers, we engage in a peculiar kind of sorcery known as \"debugging.\" It’s a delicate art that lets us wade through the rivers of time, witnessing the world through the eyes of a computer, understanding our coded creations at every step. The Friday before it all began had an air of triumph about it. I leaned back in my swivel chair and announced to my boss with a confident smile, \"The geolocated photos feature is ready to launch on Monday.\" I'd poured my coder's soul into our React Native mobile app, meticulously testing it on Android and the iOS beta - it seemed flawless. It wasn’t. But what I'm about to tell you isn't just a story. It's a descent into a week-long abyss from 2016, when the magical toolset for debugging turned its back on me, leaving me to navigate the labyrinth of my own code, blind. This is a tale of digital ghosts in the machine, and the relentless hunt that ensued to exorcise them. It’s also a story about good people. Monday After releasing the Android beta, I was surprised and confused: the images simply wouldn't upload. A conundrum wrapped in an enigma, especially given the seamless performance on Android in the sanctuary of my local testing environment, not to mention the iOS beta that sprinted without so much as a hiccup. I re-uploaded a version with improved error handling, but image uploads were failing without any feedback. You see, normally code screams its errors at you in red text - silence is the goal. Here silence was the problem. Each new iteration of the app, laden with potential solutions, demanded an hour to upload to the Play Store before it could face judgment. Like clockwork, I uploaded new guesses while I prepared for the next. I was running out of ideas and under pressure to deliver. Tuesday By the second day, I was reminded that insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results. Nothing was working. A kindred spirit, one of the embedded engineers approached me. \"I know how you feel. I've been there.\" \"Oh?\" I replied. He explained, \"We regularly ship firmware updates to remote equipment. Once in a while, a node would become unresponsive after an update.\" Curious, I asked, \"So how do you figure out what went wrong?\" He replied, \"We have to remotely retrieve the equipment and have it sent back to us for analysis. Sometimes, it takes months to determine what might have gone wrong.\" Realizing that my feedback loops were significantly shorter, I felt better knowing that at least I could put out a number of attempts each day. Wednesday By Wednesday, a seed of doubt had started growing in my mind. I started to question if software development was the right career path for me. One of the sympathetic hardware engineers approached me. \"I know how you feel. I've been there.\" \"Oh?\" \"We often release new hardware remotely, hoping it will remain functional for years. But sometimes design flaws in the hardware only become apparent after enduring multiple seasons. Things break.\" \"So, how do you figure out what went wrong?\" I asked. \"We receive old equipment through the mail, and we attempt to incorporate fixes for the next generations. However, there are times when we add a feature and it turns out to be an even worse bug. One time we added ventilation holes to reduce heat, but they were just big enough for wasps to nest in. We can conduct tests in the lab, but the ultimate test is out in the field.\" I started to realize how ambiguous problems were much more of a challenge. Maybe mobile development wasn’t so bad - at least my code either worked or didn’t. Thursday By Thursday, I began to worry about my own job security. I had been spinning on a feature I said I would ship 3 days ago. The CEO approached and sat down at my desk. I expected the worst. \"I understand how you feel, I've been there”. \"Oh?\" I asked, surprised. \"Before I started this company, I was a chemist working on my PhD dissertation,\" he explained. \"I was granted a large amount of funding for an expensive chemical to conduct a series of experiments. But weeks into the experiments, it appeared that the results had failed due to experimental error.\" \"So, how did you figure out what went wrong?\" I asked. \"I didn't.” My CEO continued, “When they asked me what I would do differently to prevent repeating the error, I couldn't even provide an answer. Somehow, and to my surprise, I still received the second round of funding.\" I fully expected to be in trouble for delaying delivery. I’ve found few leaders demonstrate a level of empathy to bring you back up when you’re feeling down. Thursday Evening On Thursday evening, I went out for sushi with some friends and shared my recent frustration with them. One of my veterinarian friends chimed in, \"I know exactly how you feel. I had a similar problem today.\" \"Oh, really?\" I asked. She continued, \"Earlier today, an owner brought in their elderly, sick dog. I suggested taking an x-ray, but the owner declined due to the cost.\" \"So, how did you figure out what was wrong with the dog?\" She replied, \"The best I could do was feel the dog's stomach from the outside. I felt something large. We performed surgery to remove what turned out to be a corn cob, but without an x-ray, I can’t even be sure that was the extent of the problem.\" For the past week, I had been hyper-focused on getting this mobile app out the door, as if nothing else mattered. But I needed to remind myself that, in the big picture, software development isn't usually about life-or-death situations. The stakes aren't typically that high. Friday By Friday morning, I noticed a discrepancy in the Android docs and my codebase. What had caused me to spin in circles for a week? A single character. I sent a message to my friend, \"Cracked it at last. It was the letter 'E'.\" For the curious, the image mime type was set to \"jpg\" but should have been\"jpeg\" - even though the files were saved as `.jpg`. (See Stack Overflow for details). She texted back, \"Appreciate the update. I needed a bit of positivity today.\" I frowned, puzzled. \"Why, what's up?\" Her response was simple and somber: \"The corn cob dog passed away this morning.\" Perhaps software development wasn’t right for me, but it didn’t seem like other professions looked much better. As software developers, it’s easy to overlook the privileges we enjoy. We have the unique ability to delve deep into intricate processes, monitor real-time activities, log what’s happening, and even pause time with a debugger. This remarkable capability is not only cheap but fast, bordering on thoughtless. While many other professions struggle to understand and resolve their issues, we have the advantage of being able to experiment multiple times a day with just a few clicks. I am grateful every day for the debugging tools that we have at our disposal. Thanks for reading Shawn’s Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

I like this one too, it&#x27;s even snappier.A software engineer, a hardware engineer and a department manager were on their way to a meeting in Switzerland. They were driving down a steep mountain road when suddenly the brakes on their car failed. The car careened almost out of control down the road, bouncing off the crash barriers, until it miraculously ground to a halt scraping along the mountainside.The car&#x27;s occupants, shaken but unhurt, now had a problem: they were stuck halfway down a mountain in a car with no brakes. What were they to do?\"I know,\" said the department manager, \"Let&#x27;s have a meeting, propose a Vision, formulate a Mission Statement, define some Goals and by a process of Continuous Improvement find a solution to the Critical Problems, and we can be on our way.\"\"No, no,\" said the hardware engineer, \"That will take far too long, and besides, that method has never worked before. I&#x27;ve got my Swiss Army knife with me, and in no time at all I can strip down the car&#x27;s braking system, isolate the fault, fix it and we can be on our way.\"\"Well,\" said the software engineer, \"Before we do anything, I think we should push the car back up the road and see if it happens again.\" reply s1artibartfast 17 hours agoparentIs the moral of the story that the hardware engineer is simply correct? - a mechanical engineer reply smt88 17 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s mostly just a joke about how these roles do their jobs.But I think it&#x27;s also partly illuminating the fact that hardware engineers are true engineers, while software engineers mostly aren&#x27;t. reply organian 12 hours agorootparentI think \"software engineers aren&#x27;t really engineers\" is putting \"real engineering\" on a pedestal that is borne of ignorance. Hillel Wayne&#x27;s engineer interviews were eye-opening on this: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hillelwayne.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;are-we-really-engineers&#x2F; reply RGamma 9 hours agorootparentProgrammers calling themselves software engineers suddenly is a very recent phenomenon (barely a decade). Dunno who pushed that, but it&#x27;s mostly basically (cognitively difficult) Lego at this point.That said, it&#x27;s also on the order of a hundred years younger a discipline and our theory is not so well developed. reply fragmede 5 minutes agorootparent> cognitively difficult LegoAh yes. Meanwhile, my friend who&#x27;s a mech-e at a car company starts from scratch on every single last project, never reusing components, and also machines every component from scratch because there&#x27;s no such thing as McMaster or any other vendor. When he works on a project, the physical parts never ever fit together like Lego. It&#x27;s not like he&#x27;d use calipers or something to do what&#x27;s called measuring (twice!) so that things fit together.There are plenty of places to demand more rigor from people writing software before considering it engineering, but reuse of parts, and having them fit together nicely is a weird one. halostatue 4 hours agorootparentprevTry longer than my career (approaching 30 years in the business), often pushed by the business and kicked into high gear with the rapid need for development resources with the combination of Y2K mitigation and the first dot-com boom.Yes, there are a lot of \"developers\". But there are also software engineers, even if our engineering craft is less-well developed by the standards of civil engineering or mechanical engineering. I understand engineering organizations (like those in Canada) who oppose the use of the term \"software engineer\" because there&#x27;s no common code of practice or standards in the same way that those who wear the iron ring claim is incorrect.I think that we, as a profession, need a code of ethics (and the ACM has a good one, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethics.acm.org&#x2F;code-of-ethics&#x2F;) and the application of software in certain cases should absolutely be regulated the same way that the various physical engineering practices are (healthcare, AI, finance, legal applications) so that there are consequences for the businesses and potentially the software engineers involved with those businesses when they cause harm (see sentencing guideline software in the US; see the contract that developed the Royal Mail \"audit\" software that could never work as advertised; see the rampant fraud that is crypto; see the abuse of generative models to software-wash copyright violations).But the lack of regulatory bodies does not mean that there&#x27;s not a practice of engineering involved, it just means that there&#x27;s no regulatory body that governs said practice. reply batch12 7 hours agorootparentprevMy dad called himself a &#x27;computer software engineer&#x27; in the early &#x27;90s. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s only a decade old. reply contrarian1234 6 hours agorootparentIn the 90s it sounded pretentious and people used to joke about it. In the early days of Google they tried to label themselves as engineers to set themselves above the rest of silicon valley. It was a way to try to signal that their work was somehow more technical reply unmole 5 hours agorootparentprev> barely a decadeYeah, no. reply s1artibartfast 10 hours agorootparentprevI have a different take. Engineer is basically synonymous with application physicist. Someone why applies the laws of physics to achieve a goal. I don&#x27;t think this is so much a pedestal, or why some software engineers are passionate. Is being a computer scientist somehow negative? reply sterlind 10 hours agorootparentI think of applied physicist as something very different, closer to science than engineering. The kinds of people who research new battery chemistries, or the techniques to unlock new semiconductor process nodes. Basically, scientists do hardcore research and expand the field, while engineers apply the techniques and formulas that the scientists have discovered, and craftsmen combine prepackaged modules built by engineers for a job.So an applied physicist discovers the light-emitting diode. An electrical engineer designs an LED light panel. An electrician wires light panels into a home.Likewise, a computer scientist discovers NFA reduction, an engineer uses it to build a regular expression compiler, and a developer writes a regex to validate email addresses. reply fsckboy 9 hours agorootparentAn electrician who designs a complex light panel using 120VAC for use in a habitable or public building needs to submit the plans to the building department to get a permit and certify that it&#x27;s not a fire hazard. You need to be a Licensed Engineer™ to do certain levels of certification.People certified to be licensed engineers didn&#x27;t necessarily graduate from a School of Engineering at a famous university that is also filled with physicists and mathematicians and English literature. Instead they need to study, learn, and pass the tests that legally certify them as Licensed Engineers™ to keep us all safe. It&#x27;s much of the same material, overlapping, but not the same. They&#x27;re less likely to consider themselves ready to move over to building rocketships to the moon on the basis of their bachelors degree.This is the source of all the debate about who is an Engineer and who is not. Licensed Engineers don&#x27;t want to consider unlicensed engineers as engineers. People who went to universities and had to study a dose of liberal arts along with control theory to get their \"Engineering degree\" don&#x27;t want to consider the choo choo Train Engineer™ as an engineer.In the US there is a bit of academic snobbery around, it&#x27;s not universal but, University of Michigan is harder to get into academically, and a little more high falutin&#x27;. Michigan State is a bit more plebian but more practical. University of Washington vs. Washington State, same thing, and so on. The licensed engineers are more likely to come from the State school, the unlicensed engineers more likely from the University of. Both want recognition for their training, which makes sense.I&#x27;m exaggerating for effect, but this is the issue. Whether software engineers are engineers is a minor skirmish on the flank of this larger war, both because there are no certifications for computer engineers, and because mathematicians are not engineers and programming languages can be studied from a mathematical perspective or from something closer to Electrical Engineering. reply sterlind 7 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m confused, is the electrician in this example the Licensed Engineer(tm)? They definitely have to be licensed, since they can burn your house down if they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing. And checking that the plans aren&#x27;t a fire hazard isn&#x27;t done by an electrical engineer, is it? I definitely wouldn&#x27;t trust the electrical engineers I went to school with to do DIY home wiring, by the same token. reply defrost 7 hours agorootparentTo the extent that Australia and the US are similar, various things require a licensed tradesperson to certify.The sticking point is what licensed tradesperson would sign off on work done by another unlicensed person?Here, I&#x27;ve often done full 240 V AC wiring and gas fitting for houses, workshops, abd glass blowingceramic studios .. but never connected or made any of it live, instead I&#x27;ve called in local tradespeople to inspect and test the work from end to end, just as they would check the work of an apprentice, and then certify it.It&#x27;s been cheaper for me that way as well as allowing for better control of how I want things to go, it&#x27;s been less hours work for them in an area where they&#x27;re in high demand and a bit of a win-win.On at least two such jobs I&#x27;ve been advised to change some details as the most recent codes had changed and required things I&#x27;d been unaware of, no drama.And no, in general university electrical engineers don&#x27;t leave university with the practical trades skills to wire looms between power plants and racks of mills, screens, and grinders drawing high voltage high amp three phase and requiring complex control and instrumentation circuits.They can sketch that out but they rarely get the practical cable pulling, wire cutting, box layout, etc experience outside of an actual trade apprenticeship type role. reply fsckboy 5 hours agorootparentprevabsolutely, you nailed it! \"collegy\" engineers don&#x27;t know a damn thing about safety in the home, and what causes electrical fires. They know kinda (\"resistance results in heat\") but they don&#x27;t know specifically a zillion little gotchas that have killed thousands of people in electrical fires.if you want to cut a hole in your wall to put in a window, it could be as easy as cutting a hole and putting in a window. Or, it could be that it&#x27;s a \"load bearing\" wall, and you need to put a wide I-beam over the new window to safely redistribute&#x2F;bear the load that the formerly intact wall was carrying. Or, you could have chosen a spot on the wall that has a column&#x2F;pillar that&#x27;s holding the roof up. Probably you&#x27;d choose a different spot, but if wanted that spot you could hire some engineers to figure out a new set of \"cantilevers\" or \"flying buttresses\" or (i&#x27;m not this type of engineer, I&#x27;m just throwing around words).As the work you do becomes more and more dangerous to more and more people, you need somebody with higher levels of certification&#x2F;licensure to approve the plan.an electrician, who has a license, is not an engineer, but a good electrician could become one if she wanted, it would require study and exam passing. Some electrical work an electrician is allowed to do, they can \"self certify\", but the city might spot inspect it. The next level of complexity they perform the work, but a building inspector needs to inspect. The next level of complexity, the plans need to be certified and approved in advance.I&#x27;m sort of making this up, piecing it together how steam fitting is done (that&#x27;s mechanical engineering), how air handling is done (also mechanical engineering), plumbing, etc. But this is the general scheme.some of this is legacy disputes left over from the 19th century. When they were inventing electrical circuits, everybody was an engineer and everybody could do everything, and people just invented stuff on the spot and tried it. After enough people died, it was decided we needed standards. And slowly a white collar&#x2F;blue collar sort of distinction started to emerge, for work that required calculus vs work that requires knowledge of lots of specific requirements.Calculus people design cars and planes with smooth sleek shapes, but those items can&#x27;t be constructed without the other type of engineer saying \"hey, that&#x27;s not strong enough\" replycrdrost 10 hours agorootparentprevI liked these interviews but I do find the result kind of... apathetic? I feel like you can read these and just come to a sense that nothing is engineering because everything is amorphous, which is not (I think) Hillel’s thesis but he doesn’t really want to anchor the discussion in principle because he is fundamentally asking for opinions.For a more principled approach, I would say (as one of these “licensed engineers who has not done as much actual engineering”) that engineering as I have seen it kind of has three really major themes:• Prototyping&#x2F;building&#x2F;creation. Tinkering. I guess the reason we don&#x27;t talk about this is that everybody finds it trivial? But when you talk to ChemEs and they discuss optimizing pipelines for chemical processes you do see that it can get a little abstract so it&#x27;s worth pointing to as a baseline.• An underlying scientific theory that guides the models used. Building stuff has happened since way before science but engineering is clearly a postscientific endeavor, “here’s the underlying mechanical principles of how this works.” This is probably the sketchier principle in how we talk about “is this software design really engineering,” we tend to not have a firm scientific understanding of the problem domain of building software. Some things like CAP theorem, patch theories in version control (Darcs, Pijul), distributed consensus algorithms, TCP&#x2F;IP, I would say really rise to that challenge and say something hard-learned about real systems. Things like OS kernels also have so much trial and error, so much prototyping that it feels like “yes you really did do enough hypothesis-test-reëvaluate cycles that the result embodies a model of the problem domain that counts as a scientific understanding.” But a lot of our work is just gluing systems together and that seems more “electrician” than “electrical engineering.” Now, science uses math, so people think of engineering as highly mathematical, I am not sure that it has to be. Whereas I do think it has to be scientifically based.• The last big thing that I think we don&#x27;t talk about enough is risk assessment. The reason that we’re doing all of this science and math to build a bridge, is so that we can assess how strong it needs to be to just barely survive the peak loads that it will ever have, and then double that strength just in case.I think that when we say “not all programmers are doing software engineering” a good proxy for that is looking at, first, do you have a scientific model of the sorts of approaches that you can do; and then, do you use it to assess numerically the kind of loads that your system will come under up-front and design accordingly—writes per second, queries per second—and set realistic targets and choose caching and consensus and whatever else to achieve those and measure that you have... Or do you work via crude heuristics, “we use Kubernetes so I&#x27;m sure it will scale later, we do ‘best practices’ so we don&#x27;t have to think about those,” and related kludges where we can comfortably say you&#x27;re just tinkering rather than being principled about it.And then, this reveals that maybe you don&#x27;t need to be doing engineering, maybe you really do just need to tinker in the problem space while you achieve better product-market fit. Maybe you are doing science rather than engineering, and that is okay. Like, the idea that you are going to launch the next space shuttle with your reliability, I am sure that makes for a very energized, focused workplace, but it&#x27;s not a precondition, it&#x27;s not the only way to get there. reply renewiltord 16 hours agorootparentprevTrue.

Then they should walk to the nearest fuel station, purchase fuel, and walk back. During that time, they can calculate the amount of fuel that will evaporate while they have the gas cap off and the amount of fuel that will stick to the walls of the piping between the gas cap and the fuel tank.

Too many developers think silence is the goal, but the goal is actually accuracy. If there&#x27;s no error, yes, it should be silent.

Experimenting meant building giant copper coils, running enough current in them to melt them in place, and then very quickly detonating explosive around the coil so that, for a fraction of a second, the magnetic field at the center of the coil became the most intense ever built by mankind, before the whole setup was destroyed by the splattering of liquid copper thousands of degrees hot.

The implication being that no lives were on the line if we made a mistake. This was when I was making games but it also applies to just about every CRUD app I&#x27;ve written.Tangentially, one thing I often ask other senior technical leaders (especially Director, VP or CTO) is: what is the most costly mistake you have made? If you are a junior engineer, make sure you do it sometime. Many&#x2F;most high-level leaders in tech can tell stories in the $100k to $1m range. I&#x27;ve seen people lose millions of dollars on a project and get promoted immediately after. It is important to understand why that can happen and why it can even be a good thing. reply knaidofngio 16 hours agoparent>The implication being that no lives were on the line if we made a mistake.

Maybe a failure won&#x27;t result in people dying in a ball of fire, but it can still cause harm. Even minor harm can still add up at scale.Frustration from a buggy game could lead to real-world road rage or shouting matches. People have killed themselves because a computer sent them a bogus bill. Businesses have failed because software lost valuable data. People have been murdered because of silly social media apps. People have organized pogroms on Twitter. People have been stalked and assaulted using information leaked by Pokemon Go.Software has real power. If it didn&#x27;t, there would be no point in writing it. reply zoogeny 15 hours agorootparentIt is fair to misunderstand what I was saying since all things are ambiguous. Without context I could see this being interpreted as permission for people to be lazy, incautious or even negligent.But I urge you to consider the other side of the spectrum and the pressures that people can put on themselves. For some, in their search for perfection, they can ruin their own lives. They can see every mistake they make as a personal failure. It is useful to remember that in the vast majority of cases people bounce back from these failures.You will hear over and over how many entrepreneurs fail in their first businesses, often several times. Most often in life you don&#x27;t just get a second chance, you get many chances. There a only a few places in life where a single failure is truly catastrophic.So if you find yourself overwhelmed as a junior engineer, as described in this story. If you feel your stomach in knots and you are terrified your lead in going to eviscerate you in front of a cheering audience - just know you have more latitude to fail and try again than you might expect. reply knaidofngio 15 hours agorootparentI never thought you said that sloppiness is acceptable. I edited my comment to try to make that clearer.But I think we should remember that everything matters. People&#x27;s lives are not mostly made of weddings and funerals and gun fights and plane crashes. They&#x27;re mostly made of chores and small talk and dumb little mobile games. Nothing is really trivial. You shouldn&#x27;t beat yourself up over mistakes, but that&#x27;s not because they don&#x27;t matter. reply zoogeny 15 hours agorootparentSure, everything matters. But some things matter more than others. If my internet fails for an afternoon that seems to matter less than if my wedding is a catastrophe. If my video game crashes that seems to matter less than a plane crash. We call this \"putting things into perspective\".I mentioned the word \"humility\" in another response and that is the crux of what I&#x27;m trying to communicate. It is often the case that we can exaggerate the importance of our own work and it often helps to take a step back and humble oneself. If you find yourself losing sleep over your work, if you find your anxiety levels high, perhaps you need some perspective. Perhaps you find it distasteful for me to suggest that the engineering work of air-traffic control software matters more than most CRUD apps. That doesn&#x27;t mean every other kind of software has zero worth. It just provides an anchor for perspective - a kind of software where literally thousands of lives are at stake 24 hours per day. Most developers are not under that kind of stress. reply gwbas1c 16 hours agoparentprev> we aren&#x27;t making air-traffic control systems hereI also find that attitude troubling.I&#x27;ve worked on software that could loose peoples&#x27; cherished data. Now I work on software that could cause flooding if it misbehaves.Take a bit more pride in your work. reply zoogeny 16 hours agorootparentYou can definitely take the comment in the worst way possible if you desire.This was in the early 2000s in the games industry. I&#x27;m not sure if you are familiar with that culture, but it was a time when the engineers were working 12+ hour days for months at a time. People were pouring their heart, souls and sanity into shipping software, often working until they literally broke down. I remember one engineer boasting that he had worked for 2 months straight without taking a single day off.In that environment the stress was high and technical discussions could often escalate into heated arguments. We often had to remind ourselves that we were making games and many people working there were supposedly living their childhood dreams. It was important to remember that.The idea that we didn&#x27;t take pride in our work or didn&#x27;t do everything in our abilities to ship the highest quality software is beyond incorrect. It was that excessive pride that we needed to guard against by checking in to reality. It wasn&#x27;t a call to laziness, it was a call to humility. reply hasbot 18 hours agoprevAs a software engineer I always kinda enjoyed debugging. It allowed me to use a different skill and mind set than creating designs and implementing them.Not to say I didn&#x27;t get stressed out debugging. I had one demo while developing software for AT&T&#x27;s 5ESS telephone switch. We had only one phone line in the test lab configured for our feature. Attempt after attempt the software just wouldn&#x27;t work. Knowing the software worked, I checked everything I could all the while stressing out. Finally I asked the lab tech to check the line. Somehow our only configured line was disconnected. The problem was a stupid hardware issue. reply 59nadir 1 hour agoparentI enjoy debugging when the tools are there, not so much when choices have been made to put everything too out of reach, either figuratively or literally. Debugging distributed systems in the cloud is exponentially more awful than debugging them when you can at least spin up all your services locally and that in turn is exponentially worse than when you can debug the problem in just one program.An actual debugger also makes the act of debugging much nicer to me. I&#x27;ve never understood people who quibble about using either printf debugging or an actual debugger when using both is such a massive win. Arguably good tracing facilities should be highlighted here as well since they&#x27;re much nicer than printf debugging when they&#x27;re available.> Not to say I didn&#x27;t get stressed out debugging.This is interesting because I remember very early in my programming journey I used to attach a lot of unnecessary things to not understanding why something was happening (or not happening) and gradually I just came to embrace the \"Hang on, why is this so? I don&#x27;t get it... Ohh, hang on... Wow, it really makes sense why this didn&#x27;t work!\" loop and internalize the fact that it feels really good when I get to the end of it.The process of not knowing can only really get ruined by other people&#x27;s expectations and behaviors for me at this point and I&#x27;ve learned over time that this can only be managed by being very assertive about how things are done (language choices, architectural choices, etc.) so as to make the process as easy and quick as possible. Ultimately it&#x27;s a lot easier (at this point in my career) to convince someone that working with AWS lambda is a bad choice for performance, overall costs, debuggability and development speed (all to varying degrees) than it is to convince them later that there is a good reason that fixing that one problem is taking more time than it ought to. reply fatnoah 18 hours agoparentprev> As a software engineer I always kinda enjoyed debugging.

It turns out that the character ’ when typed on a Mac keyboard is not compatible with all versions of HL7, or perhaps wasn’t compatible with what the HL7 was passed off to. It’s a distant memory now but it was words like o’clock versus o′clock, or something like that which broke radiology report distribution.It went on for years before being caught.Edit: HN is displaying the ’ differently to how it looks when I type it, but it’s still the same character.

Look, software engineering is a great job if you enjoy the work. But even in this parable, the problem is the author&#x27;s week of distress and flailing. It has nothing to do with the work and everything to do with the author.All the others he turns towards, no matter their discipline, their tools for investigation, or the constraints they faced in a dilemma, relate stories where they have a mature understanding of how their industry works and how they navigate its system. They encounter problems in the course of their work and they resolve them in the course of their work. Maybe it takes a little while to proceed with diagnosis. Maybe it takes a long while to integrate improvements into a later product. Maybe they need to forgo some procedure that they prefer to use.By the authors account, the embedded engineer, the hardware engineer, the CEO and veterinarian all face greater challenges when solving problems in their work, yet they all speak of their road through those challenges with a confidence that the author lacks. They try to soothe the author and empathize, but none of their stories hint at a week of panicked flailing.So if they handle their work so much more confidently, is it true that their dilemmas are worse and that the author is lucky to be a software engineer?If the author listened to their own invented characters, the realization to come to is not that the author is lucky to work in a field with purported \"privileges\" and that everyone else has it worse (gross!), but that everyone faces dilemmas in their work and that the real skill is in staying cool and confidently relying on the processes of their discipline. And this has everything to do with the person doing the work and nothing to do with the discipline. The realization is that challenges arise in all professions and that you can proceed through them without distress and flailing if you allow yourself patience and confidence.It&#x27;s funny because they wrote this as a parable, but they missed the real lesson in the very piece they wrote.

My brother usually runs a Raycast workflow I wrote for him to extract a small number of party data as TSV which gets copied in clipboard. Then in sheets he can just paste that to get full rows and columns populated.After that he and his friends start proof reading and cross referencing social media data for each row, and Sheets makes this super easy as they can see each row highlighted with each user’s color so they don’t step on each other’s toes.Your solution is still very good for other use cases and I think I already have one in mind.

They do list tour dates in their google sheet and also can sell out pretty large venues easily, and I don&#x27;t think there are any festival planners who don&#x27;t know who Portugal, the Man who have any chance of nabbing them for their festival. reply senthil_rajasek 7 hours agorootparentAhhh that totally makes sense.

President Kagame promotes the continent as a unified tourism destination. Kenya is also set to implement visa-free travel for Africans by December 31. Rwanda has become the latest African country to announce visa-free entry for fellow African states. ADVERTISEMENT RECOMMENDED ARTICLES Leaders Olanrewaju Alaka founder of Laerryblue Media discusses the future of Public Relations in Africa Leaders France to repatriate $150 million Abacha loot to Nigeria Leaders Dangote ranks 9th on list of top 10 richest manufacturing billionaires in the world According to data from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, President Paul Kagame made the announcement in the capital city of Rwanda, Kigali. There, he promoted Africa's potential as \"a unified tourism destination\" for a continent that still receives 60% of its visitors from outside of the continent. “Any African, can get on a plane to Rwanda whenever they wish and they will not pay a thing to enter our country” the Rwandan president stated at the 23rd Global Summit of the World Travel and Tourism Council. “We should not lose sight of our own continental market. Africans are the future of global tourism as our middle class continues to grow at a fast pace in the decades to come,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT On Monday, President William Ruto of Kenya declared that by December 31, all Africans will be able to enter Kenya without a visa. \"By the end of this year, no African will need a visa to enter Kenya. The time has come to understand the importance of doing trade between us,” the Kenyan head of state declared. “It is time we realize the importance of trading among ourselves and allowing goods, services, people, and ideas to move freely across the continent,” he added. The African Union introduced the African passport in 2016, promising to \"unleash the potential of the continent\" in a manner comparable to that of the European Union. However, up until now, the travel document has only been granted to diplomats and AU officials. According to the African Union's website, the African Passport and free movement of people are intended to \"remove restrictions on Africans ability to travel, work, and live within their own continent.\" ADVERTISEMENT The African Union also established the African Continental Free Trade Area, a free trade area spanning the whole continent with an estimated value of $3.4 trillion. Its goals are to promote economic growth and provide a single, united market for the 1.3 billion people living on the continent.

That&#x27;s where I think a wider view is important. reply mrkstu 11 hours agorootparentThe main difference is that you can fully implement a &#x27;Christian&#x27; values state and it isn&#x27;t going against the grain to base it on mercy, equality, and not &#x27;othering&#x27; those who don&#x27;t agree. In other words a fully Christian society can fully implement the teachings found in the New Testament and not be considered &#x27;radical&#x27; in any sense by a non-Christian living in that society. While it may be &#x27;missionary&#x27; oriented it also wouldn&#x27;t require exporting its philosophy. It also is comfortable separating civil and religious law - &#x27;render unto Ceasar.&#x27;Islam, fully implementing the Koran, is basically the opposite.It requires fidelity at the threat of death and the forced conversion of outsiders. It requires civil and religious law to be the same.Iran for instance instantiates the tenets of Islam in fact.The Christian theocracies are basically historical dead letters at this point- and were mostly overlays on existing government structures:The Roman Empire for instance continued to be Rome after the Emperors became Christian- it never really, despite the Pope&#x27;s best efforts, become more than a light overlay on existing government structures, with King&#x27;s utilizing theories of &#x27;Divine Right of Kings&#x27; as a useful way to perpetuate their existing hierarchies. Even countries like Armenia that claimed explicitly to be Christian states aren&#x27;t actually ruled by the priesthood- they have established national religions in many historical instances, not a truly religiously run state like Iran where the mullah&#x27;s are the ultimate authority.Rome&#x2F;Papal States, Peter the great, Geneva&#x2F;Calvin, some slice of the Byzantine empire, along with pre-United States Utah (and in a smaller scale the city of Nauvoo,) where you have had the clerical and government structures completely united in a Christian state that I can think of off hand.

Rwanda is at 0.534 (this is potentially suspect as Rwanda has been fudging numbers [0]), Tanzania is at 0.549, and Uganda is at 0.525.It is a similar story in West Africa as well.While there are some bright spots in human capital in Kenya, it&#x27;s much less diffused than similar undeveloped to developed stories like Bangladesh or Vietnam, let alone China, India, Thailand, etc. Going from less developed to developing requires some kind of a nudge and capital, and in South Korea, Bangladesh and Vietnam&#x27;s cases it came from Japan, India and China respectively.There isn&#x27;t a similar case in sub-Saharan Africa yet. If South Africa can get it&#x27;s economy back in track, there might be a shot for the rest of the continent, as they are in the right position to diffuse capital, human capital, and businesses.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;683047ac-b857-11e9-96bd-8e884d3ea... reply tim333 13 hours agorootparentIf you look at the rate of increase in HDI though then less developed Africa is the fastest improving.(Average annual HDI growth from 2010 to 2021 https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_Human_Dev...)The other region which has grown fast is the China area but that may slow a bit as China de-accelerates. reply alephnerd 12 hours agorootparentTrue, but it&#x27;s at a lower base. HDI is a mixture of per Capita income, life expectancy, and literacy.Life Expectancy and Literacy rate has been growing at a significant amount in plenty of sub-Saharan Africa over the past few years, but that&#x27;s from a low base. The extremely low hanging fruit will be largely caught within a decade, which will then slow down as that requires significant reforms and expansion in healthcare and education quality and availability.Per Capita Income will still always be a significant issue though, as my earlier point still stands. You need a strong economy to further grow out, and that is largely a factor of good education as well as you need to climb up the value chain.Climbing the value chain is hard without outside stimulus. Most countries that have seen a rapid transformation were able to do so because another country decided to mentor and invest a massive amount in the country&#x27;s economic base.There just isn&#x27;t a reason to do any manufacturing or high value services in most sub-Saharan African economies. There are plenty of cheap and well integrated Asian countries right now like like Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, parts of India that can still be competitive in low manufacturing for the next 1-2 decades.It will anyhow take 1-2 decades for some sub-Saharan countries to anyhow invest in human capital. Kenya and Tanzania have been doing some very hard work on this regard.With Rwanda, less so if we&#x27;re being honest. Flashy projects like CMU Kigali and Thailand level cleanliness aside, Rwanda hasn&#x27;t been able to bring a high value industry into the country yet. It&#x27;s GDP per Capita is barely $1,000, median income is around $750-780, and around 60% of public and infra investment is coming directly from foreign aid.The business culture there is simply much less mature compared to that in Nairobi or Dar es Salaam, and what happens when Kagame dies?The same thing happened with Ethiopia. Addis Ababa became very flashy and clean, yet the country ended up collapsing into civil war and almost a decade of development was washed away.> other region which has grown fast is the China areaThe biggest winner from an HDI growth basis was actually Türkiye. They largely caught up with Eastern Europe over the last 15-20 years, and were able to keep consistently high growth (around 5-6% GDP growth rate in average since 2009) despite hitting China in 2023 level metrics almost 15 years agoChina&#x27;s growth has been amazing but it will largely slow down reply tim333 10 hours agorootparentSometimes free market economics lets countries grow without a government plan. \"Rwanda hasn&#x27;t been able to bring a high value industry into the country yet\" implies a lack industrial planning but googling a bit finds:>KIGALI, July 11, 2023—Rwanda’s economy grew by 9.2% in the first quarter of 2023, following 8.2% growth in 2022.implying they are doing ok.

Here we get:>UK economy grew by 0.2% overall between April and June, after a surprisingly positive performance...which is not quite the same. reply alephnerd 9 hours agorootparentA significant portion of that growth is coming from Donor Aid. In 2019, foreign donor aid represented 14.8% of GDP [0]FDI within Rwanda has actually been decreasing because of a larger pullback of donors out of Rwanda [0][1]Most high value projects that are being built in Rwanda are being targeted at the energy sector [2]. Specifically in oil refining. The other half of major exports from Rwanda is gold, that is primarily extracted from DRC and exported from Rwanda.Compared to its peers in East Africa, the Rwandan economy is much less complex than it should be. In all honesty, it&#x27;s smokes and mirrors exacerbated by a strong PR relationship between the Rwandan govt, donors, and NGOs. You don&#x27;t hear half as much about Kenya, Tanzania, or Uganda as you do about Rwanda, yet almost everything within Rwanda is basically being managed by donors, and a couple Chinese and Indian conglomerates making a quick buck [3]> Sometimes free market economics lets countries grow without a government planFree Market economics still requires a formal vision or strategy to develop a country. South Korea had a formalized strategy in the 80s and 90s, China in the 90s and 2000s, India in the 2000s and 2010s, etc.If you go purely free market, then there is no actual incentive.Take a look at neighboring Kenya. Tanzania, and Uganda. They have actual formal industrial and Human capital development projects with the intended aim of building out that muscle locally. The kinds of programs Rwanda creates like this (eg. CMU Kigali) simply don&#x27;t have an RoI. The exact same thing happened in Ethiopia.> implying they are doing okHigh GDP growth is expected at Rwanda&#x27;s stage of development. But Rwanda&#x27;s rate of growth is not as impressive compared to Cambodia, Kenya, and Vietnam when they were at a similar stage to Rwanda, but with a much lower dependency on foreign aid. Hell, when Kenya was at the exact same stage as Rwanda today in the mid-2000s, they were actively building out an industrial program (eg. Cements), a services economy (eg. mPesa, microfinancing), and investing in govt run universites.Around 1.3% of GDP growth in Rwanda can be attributed to foreign aid alone. With foreign aid, it ends up getting disbursed and managed by NGOs and Donors directly, not the government. As such, this causes a significant deficiency in institutional knowledge. This has been seen with falsified poverty alleviation and GDP growth data from Rwanda. This is a very big trap that can cause Rwanda to fail to expand beyond their existing capacity. Rwanda&#x27;s extreme dependence on aid at it&#x27;s current stage is developing into a form of Dutch disease.It&#x27;s already started happening with more capital leaving Rwanda than entering it [4]. When Kenya [5] and Tanzania [6] were in a similar position in the 2000s and 2010s respectively they saw net flows of capital into their countries. This is dangerous as this implies that any economic activity within Rwanda is reaped abroad.[0] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issafrica.org&#x2F;iss-today&#x2F;could-fdi-be-rwandas-lifelin...[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;countries&#x2F;RWA&#x2F;rwanda&#x2F;foreign-dir...[2] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.rw&#x2F;highlights&#x2F;economy-and-business[3] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;asia.nikkei.com&#x2F;Economy&#x2F;China-and-India-stage-invest...[4] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;rwanda&#x2F;capital-flows[5] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;kenya&#x2F;capital-flows[6] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tradingeconomics.com&#x2F;tanzania&#x2F;capital-flows replyNauticalCat 19 hours agoparentprevNot really.

Those would have to undertake a process later in life to acquire French citizenship (not sure if just bureaucratic or monetary costs involved too).Many may not bother acquiring French citizenship if they’re already EU citizens, married to one, or if acquiring another citizenship creates a problem in their other country.Would have been more useful if they dug into birthplace and immigration status.France created a lot of this problem itself by thinking it was their right to just show up in foreign territories and telling everyone to learn French. reply lm28469 15 hours agorootparent> France created a lot of this problem itself by thinking it was their right to just show up in foreign territories and telling everyone to learn French.No country in the world is free from that though...

First off, making the practice official makes pricing a lot more transparent. If a country just outright says \"no-questions-asked visas for $1000, citizenship for $10,000\" then that also means the immigration control officer can&#x27;t demand $2000 bribes to someone who can&#x27;t meet the official immigration rules.Furthermore, one of the advantages of widespread corruption is that everyone has to do it, which means everyone can be prosecuted for it. You could, say, require political candidates to pay million-dollar bribes, and then if those candidates actually get popular enough to threaten your power, prosecute them for bribing themselves onto the ballot. If everyone&#x27;s a criminal, it doesn&#x27;t mean the crime isn&#x27;t a crime. It means you can strip people of their rights at any time without question.If corruption were made official, this goes away. Someone who bought a golden visa or passport can&#x27;t be prosecuted if the procedure for buying it was on the books and above-board - even if it&#x27;s priced like some kind of \"Sybil-resistant\" anarchocapitalist cryptocurrency hellscape of humans-as-piles-of-money. reply yawboakye 14 hours agoprev [–] great move! hopefully my beloved ghana will follow suit. anybody who has tracked flights for fun or profit realizes the poverty of international travel on the continent. fast on the heels of these changes should be transnational land transports (trains, buses, etc) to complete air travel, and an intentional promotion of the continent.i’m filled with sadness anytime i see a 20-something year-old african wasting away their strength and intellect in the care of a senile european. or the disproportionate number of africans cleaning the streets of paris. it’s got to stop. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

I guess you don&#x27;t hear about times the generator worked, but it feels like a high rate of failure to me. reply linsomniac 20 hours agorootparentThese experiences of power outages is weird to me. What I consider \"typical\" data center design should make it really hard to lose power.\"Typical\" design would be: Each cabinet fed by 2 ATS (transfer switch). Each ATS fed by two UPS (battery bank). Each UPS fed by utility with generator backup. The two ATS can share one UPS&#x2F;generator, so each cabinet would be fed by 3 UPS+generator. A generator failing to start shouldn&#x27;t be a huge deal, your cabinet should still have 2 others.The data center I&#x27;m currently in did have a power event ~3 years ago, I forget the exact details but Mistakes Were Made (tm). There were several mistakes that led to it, including that one of the ATS had been in \"maintenance mode\", because they were having problems getting replacement parts, but then something else happened as well. In short, they had gotten behind on maintenance and no longer had N+1 redundancy.On top of that, their communication was bad. It was snowing cats and dogs, we suddenly lose all services at that facility (an hour away), and I call and their NOC will only tell me \"We will investigate it.\" Not a \"We are investigating multiple service outages\", just a \"we will get back to you.\" I&#x27;m trying to decide if I need to drive multiple hours in heavy snow to be on site, and they&#x27;re playing coy... reply mdip 19 hours agorootparentYou summed up quite well how these things happen.All of these parts make for an increasingly complex system with a large number of failure points.Our DC was a very living entity -- servers were being changed out&#x2F;rack configuration altered very regularly. Large operations were carefully planned. You wouldn&#x27;t overlook the power requirements of a few racks being added -- there&#x27;d -- literally[0] -- be no place to plug them in without an electrician being brought in. However, in a 3-month period every once in a while, two racks would have old devices replaced either due to failure or refresh, one at a time.Since they weren&#x27;t plugged directly into rack batteries (we had two battery rooms providing DC-wide battery backup), the overload wouldn&#x27;t trip. Since we were still below the capacity of the circuit, the breaker(s) wouldn&#x27;t trip. And maybe we&#x27;re still under capacity for our backup system, but a few of the batteries are under-performing.I think the lesson we learned when this happened was: you need to \"actually test\" the thing. My understanding is that our tests were of the individual components in isolation. We&#x27;d load test the batteries and the generator and then the relays between. At the end of the day, though, if you don&#x27;t cut the power and see what happens you don&#x27;t truly know. And my understanding is that having that final step in place resulted in a large number of additional tests being devised \"of the individual components\" that ensured they never had an outage like that, again.[0] Guessing it&#x27;s common practice to make \"finding a f!cking power outlet\" nearly impossible in DC. Every rack had exactly the number of leads it needed for the hardware plugged into a completely full receptacle. They rolled around a cart with a monitor, printer, label printer, keyboard, mouse and a huge UPS on it so staff could do daily maintenance work. reply danudey 17 hours agorootparentWe had an outage a few years ago on Black Friday; we had been getting our DC to purchase and rack servers for us for years, and the data centre had IIRC four separate circuits that our servers were on depending on which rack they were in. Unfortunately, we hadn&#x27;t provided them input into which servers were which purpose, and we occasionally repurposed hardware from one service to another.This resulted in one of our microservices existing entirely on one circuit, along with significant swaths of other services. We also overprovisioned our hardware so that we could cope with huge increases in traffic, e.g. Black Friday&#x2F;Cyber Monday weekend. Generally a good idea, but since our DC obviously didn&#x27;t have any visibility into our utilization, they didn&#x27;t realize that, if our servers suddenly spiked to 100% CPU use, it could triple our power usage.Easy to see where this is going, I&#x27;m sure.The microservice which existed entirely on one circuit was one of the most important, and was hit constantly - we were a mobile game company, and this service kept track of players&#x27; inventories, etc. Not something you want to hit the database for, so we had layers of caching in Redis and memcached, all of which lived on the application servers themselves, all of them clustered so that we could withstand several of our servers going offline. This meant that when we got a massive influx of players all logging in to take advantage of those Black Friday deals, the service hit probably the hardest was this service, and its associated redis and memcached clusters, as well as (to a lesser extent) the primary database and the replication nodes - some of which were also on the same circuit.So as we&#x27;re all trying to tune the systems live to optimize for this large influx of traffic, it trips the breaker on that circuit and something like 1&#x2F;3 of our servers go offline. We call the CEO of the DC company, he has to call to figure out what the heck just happened, and it takes a while to figure out what the heck just went on and why. Someone has to go into the DC to flip the breaker (once they know that it&#x27;s not just going to fly again), which is a several-hour drive from Vancouver to Seattle.Meantime, we all have to frantically promote replication databases, re-deploy services to other application servers, and basically try to keep our entire system up and online for the largest amount of traffic we&#x27;ve ever had on 60% of the server capacity we&#x27;d planned on.I was working on that problem (not just awake, but specifically working on that issue) for 23 hours straight after the power went out. Our CEO made a list of every server we had and how we wanted to balance them across the circuits, and then the DC CEO and I spent all night powering off servers one by one, physically moving them to different cabs, bringing them online, rinse repeat.TL;DR electricity is complicated. reply AdamJacobMuller 17 hours agorootparentprevWhile what you&#x27;re describing is definitely possible, but, datacenter architecture is becoming less and less bulletproof-reliable in service of efficiency (both cost as well as PUE). reply datadeft 17 hours agorootparentprev>> These experiences of power outages is weird to me.

The idea of these is that you’d have enough juice for the generator to kick in. You couldn’t run these for longer periods, and even if you could, you’d still have the AC unpowered, which would quickly lead to machines overheating and crashing. Plus the building access controls need powering too. As does lighting, and a whole host of other critical systems. But the AC alone is a far more significant problem than powering the racks. (I’ve worked in places when the AC has failed, it’s not fun. You’d be amazed how much heat those systems can kick out). reply ta1243 14 hours agorootparentIn my experience, you have building UPS on one MDU and General supply on the other. Building UPS will power everything until generators spin up, and if the UPS itself dies then you&#x27;re still powered from general supplyDid lose one building about 20 years ago when the generator didn&#x27;t startBut then I assume that any services I have which are marked as three-nines or more have to be provided from multiple buildings to avoid that type of single point of failure.

Much like the theatre “You are only as good as your last rehearsal”. reply mdip 19 hours agorootparentprevHad something similar happen at a telecom I worked at for years. We had a diesel generator and a couple of (bathroom sized) rooms full of (what looked like) car batteries. My understanding is that the two rooms were for redundancy. The batteries could power the DC for hours but were used only until the generator was ready.The area our DC was located in was impressively reliable power-wise and -- in fact -- the backup systems had managed through the multi-state power outage in the early 2000s without a hitch (short of nearly running out of fuel due to our fuel supplier being ... just a little overwhelmed).A few years later a two minute power outage caused the DC to go dark for a full day. Upon the power failing, the batteries kicked in and a few minutes after that the generator fired up and the DC went into holy terror.About a minute after the generator kicked in, power to the DC blinked and ended. The emergency lights kicked in, the evacuate alarm sounded[0] and panic ensued.My very pedestrian understanding of the problem was that a few things failed -- when the generator kicked in, something didn&#x27;t switch power correctly, then something else didn&#x27;t trip in response to that, a set of 4 batteries caught fire (and destroyed several nearby). They were extinguished by our facilities manager with a nearby fire extinguisher. He, incidentally, was the one who pulled the alarm (which wouldn&#x27;t, on its own, trigger the Halon system, I think). The remainder of the day was spent dealing with the aftermath.We were a global multi-national telecom with a mess of procedures in place for this sort of thing. Everything was installed by electricians, to very exacting standards[1] but -- as with most things \"backup\" -- the way it was tested and the frequency of those tests was inadequate.From that point forward (going on over a decade) they thoroughly tested the battery&#x2F;generator backup once a quarter.[0] We were warned to GTFO if that alarm goes off due to the flooding of chemicals that would follow a few minutes later. That didn&#x27;t happen.[1] I remember the DC manager taking over in Cleveland making his staff work weeks of overtime replacing zip ties with wax lace (and it was done NASA style).

You are acting as your own power utility with equipment that only runs during tests or outages. Running successfully at commissioning or during tests increases likelihood of service when needed, but is not a guarantee.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;message&#x2F;67457&#x2F; (AWS: Summary of the AWS Service Event in the US East Region, July 2, 2012)> On Friday night, as the storm progressed, several US East-1 datacenters in Availability Zones which would remain unaffected by events that evening saw utility power fluctuations. Backup systems in those datacenters responded as designed, resulting in no loss of power or customer impact. At 7:24pm PDT, a large voltage spike was experienced by the electrical switching equipment in two of the US East-1 datacenters supporting a single Availability Zone. All utility electrical switches in both datacenters initiated transfer to generator power. In one of the datacenters, the transfer completed without incident. In the other, the generators started successfully, but each generator independently failed to provide stable voltage as they were brought into service. As a result, the generators did not pick up the load and servers operated without interruption during this period on the Uninterruptable Power Supply (“UPS”) units. Shortly thereafter, utility power was restored and our datacenter personnel transferred the datacenter back to utility power. The utility power in the Region failed a second time at 7:57pm PDT. Again, all rooms of this one facility failed to successfully transfer to generator power while all of our other datacenters in the Region continued to operate without customer impact.> The generators and electrical switching equipment in the datacenter that experienced the failure were all the same brand and all installed in late 2010 and early 2011. Prior to installation in this facility, the generators were rigorously tested by the manufacturer. At datacenter commissioning time, they again passed all load tests (approximately 8 hours of testing) without issue. On May 12th of this year, we conducted a full load test where the entire datacenter switched to and ran successfully on these same generators, and all systems operated correctly. The generators and electrical equipment in this datacenter are less than two years old, maintained by manufacturer representatives to manufacturer standards, and tested weekly. In addition, these generators operated flawlessly, once brought online Friday night, for just over 30 hours until utility power was restored to this datacenter. The equipment will be repaired, recertified by the manufacturer, and retested at full load onsite or it will be replaced entirely. In the interim, because the generators ran successfully for 30 hours after being manually brought online, we are confident they will perform properly if the load is transferred to them. Therefore, prior to completing the engineering work mentioned above, we will lengthen the amount of time the electrical switching equipment gives the generators to reach stable power before the switch board assesses whether the generators are ready to accept the full power load. Additionally, we will expand the power quality tolerances allowed when evaluating whether to switch the load to generator power. We will expand the size of the onsite 24x7 engineering staff to ensure that if there is a repeat event, the switch to generator will be completed manually (if necessary) before UPSs discharge and there is any customer impact. reply spelunker 1 day agorootparentprevTest your backups!

Once you use Cloudflare for one service, it&#x27;s nice to have all of your domains going through their DNS at the very least even if you were to bypass their stack.Aside from ideological preferences or a preference for some other service, I don&#x27;t see what you gain by avoiding them. reply remram 1 day agorootparentprevI personally don&#x27;t usually use it, but if I ran a Mastodon instance or blog or anything with real traffic and limited bandwidth and the slightest potential to piss someone off, I would.

The only way I can protect against that is CF bot fight. Everything else will just immediately kill the service until it&#x27;s over. The last one lasted 24 hours; there were millions of requests from 100000s unique ips over that time; many ips from azure, gcp and aws. Why? I don&#x27;t have a clue but with CF you simply notice nothing at all.I cannot rate limit on the machines itself as they die immediately, so then I need to get more advanced firewalls etc which are vastly more expensive than CF. reply sophacles 1 day agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never had any of my 3 houses burn down.

The correct way to do things depends on so many factors, but the TLDR n probably use multiple ways to identify malicious traffic, and then block it as early as possible. Dropping all traffic from abusive IP addresses with netfilter is where you start because it&#x27;s easy&#x2F;simple. Then you can move on to grouping by ASN, and dropping closer to a load balancer.The problem (as far as I know) that cloudflare actually provides, is being able to identify abusive networks, and making them prove they&#x27;re not bots before they reach your server. If you can&#x27;t even identify the abusive traffic, you don&#x27;t have many options other than cloudflare. reply drcongo 1 day agorootparentprevDepends what you&#x27;re counting as \"little\", but maybe your experience of 10 tiny sites has blinded you to the fact that sites for activist organisations, whistleblowing, investigative journalism, non-profits and so on, are very regularly targeted. reply r1ch 1 day agorootparentprevOVH&#x27;s DDoS protection works great and is included by default on all servers.

Same with CloudFlare, it&#x27;s free, it&#x27;s convenient, it&#x27;s very good at what it does (current outage excepted), it&#x27;s widely known, easy to work with, has good support. Nobody who chooses it does so because they want to hand internet control to a single company.

We should have had free public proxy servers that relayed any publicly-accessible (public domain) static files automagically like Coral CDN, which is difficult to even find information about anymore:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en-academic.com&#x2F;dic.nsf&#x2F;enwiki&#x2F;495553And that caching should have happened in the ISP&#x27;s backbone or user&#x27;s devices so that stuff like municipal wifi \"just works\". Why are we all downloading the same Netflix stream over and over instead of using a protocol more like BitTorrent with a hash tree or content addressable memory using Subresource Integrity (SRI) for stuff like scripts and fonts instead of compiling it all into huge app.js files? Ridiculous.Short of that, basically all servers should be using something like Varnish cache, which drops in with little configuration, leaving the main lag time the distance between countries:http:&#x2F;&#x2F;varnish-cache.org&#x2F;intro&#x2F;index.html#introOne Node.js instance can serve like a million users per month. And it only takes 65 ms for light to get anywhere in the world (12,000 miles divided by 186,000 miles per second). Maybe 200 ms if the speed of light is 3 times slower in wires and fiber optic lines. Yet tons of cloud apps run slower than 1990s cgi-bin servers.Imagine how we could improve the internet&#x27;s core technologies with even the tiniest fraction of a fraction of the tech sector&#x27;s profits and any leisure time at all. This is perhaps the greatest disappointment of my life, watching all of the innovations that I thought would happen come about in a private&#x2F;corporate fashion which weakens our freedom and privacy. reply gtirloni 15 hours agoparentI think your point boils down to \"vendor&#x27;s edge cache are too far away and should be at the city level\", right?If so, major cities already have local Netflix caches in many ISPs, for example.

You just don’t tempt the DR fates like that… reply jabart 1 day agorootparentSame. Local company had a NOC and power went out in the area. They had moved into the build a long time ago and had two backup generators at the back end of the parking lot already installed. Power goes out, generator didn&#x27;t start. 2nd generator started but it was now undersized and immediately tripped the breaker. First generator tried to start and it failed again.Another local company had a backup generator in the basement. They were doing maintenance work on the power and messed up so the generator kicked in. Since it was in the basement, they had a belt to drive an exhaust fan. Generator kicked on, fan belt snapped, exhaust filled the entire basement, rolled into the service elevator, starts coming out the 3rd floor (top of the service elevator) and the building was then evacuated.Last generator story, small IT shop with a small colo in the 2000s moved into a new building and got a natural gas generator installed with it running a self diagnostic once a month. Power goes out in the first month, lights go out, generator kicks on, lights come back, lights go back off. Turns out that the electrician didn&#x27;t have a 60amp breaker that day and put in a 20 amp breaker for a 60+ amp generator.

I remember one where they’d tested the generator but only for like a couple of minutes each month and so the fuel in the tank was really old by the time there was a real outage and the generator clogged expensively about an hour in, right as people were relaxing and thinking it’d be smooth sailing until the main power line was restored. replyRygian 1 day agoparentprevWhich would you guess, cause or effect? reply j16sdiz 1 day agoprevThe most impressive thing is: The status page actually works reply latraveler 1 day agoparentwhy don&#x27;t they just make the plane out of the status page? reply carlhjerpe 1 day agoparentprev\"Powered by Atlassian Statuspage\" reply josh_carterPDX 1 day agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t it ironic that of all the services failing the status page never seems to go down?

One example of the approach is the separate top-level domain usually used. If I were setting a status page up, I would ensure it was with a different cloud provider, and ideally a separate side of the country or separate continent from my principal DC. reply lbriner 1 day agoprevI think most of us can forgive pretty much any mistake but for a service company, there are two golden rules:1) Know that you have a problem quickly. We reported an issue yesterday and it took them 3 hours to acknowledge that there was a problem, causing us to waste hours trying to make sure nothing on our system was causing it2) Always have a quick way to roll back changes or mitigate a problem.

This seems to be the most frequent failure mode that I see with my use of Tunnels. Existing connections will continue working, but attempts to create new ones (or other changes) fail.

They want to push you down a very specific path, and don&#x27;t provide a lot of information if you want to take a bit more control over your dev process (as I always want to do) which directly leads to points of failure like this.

Unfortunately browsers vendors do not implement it. reply radicalbyte 20 hours agorootparentInteresting - I know DNSSEC (great solution) but haven&#x27;t seen DANE. From a quick glance it looks like an obvious solution which should be implemented by the browser vendors and top sites. reply jeroenhd 18 hours agorootparentDNSSEC is a great concept with a rather convoluted design that&#x27;s based on limitations of computers in the 90s. It&#x27;s obviously better to have DNSSEC than not to, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it a \"great solution\".Case in point: the DNS client never actually validates the DNSSEC signatures, the DNS server the client uses is supposed to do that, and then simply sets a flag that says \"I validated this\". Perfect for recursive DNS resolvers running on localhost, but terrible for security when applied as designed.Another example: Firefox currently has encrypted client hello enables to encrypt the SNI information and help combat traffic analysis, but only if you enable DoH to ensure that the necessary DNS records are correct. Once again, Mozilla didn&#x27;t trust DNSSEC to work right and opted to trust DoH servers on their word.In truth, DNSSEC isn&#x27;t widely used, at least not internationally. Some TLDs have high DNSSEC usages, often because their registrar advocates for securing DNS, but with companies like Amazon failing to produce DNSSEC software that doesn&#x27;t cause massive outages and TLDs like .nz going down for a day because of bad policies and management, many people don&#x27;t bother.It&#x27;s a shame, really, because DANE would&#x27;ve fixed so many problems.

That threw me for a loop the first time I encountered it. I felt they were being tremendously dishonest.Where I live, you are totally permitted and encouraged to also provide an itemized price breakdown, but the sticker price is what I&#x27;m paying you at the end of the day.

The only thing that matters is how much it will cost me to get the thing. Everything one must pay, including all fees and taxes should be included. Listing these will only cause unnecessary confusion and is often done in a deceptive manner.It has nothing to do with adding root certificates to browsers. These are consumer protection laws against deceptive advertising. It may be surprising to Americans but in most of Europe, thanks to such laws, the price you see is usually the exact price you are paying. No taxes, fees or tips, it is all included, which I think is better for everyone. reply master-lincoln 18 hours agorootparentprev> for clarification, they banned disclosing it in initial communications like emailsplease give a source for that. That&#x27;s the spin some airlines gave it, but as far as I understood the new requirement was to list the full price including taxes and fees in advertisements. This could be seen as hiding the fees and taxes, but the Airlines are still allowed to list fees and taxes.In Europe, listing the full price is mandated for all industries as far as I know. Feels bad as a customer to not know what you will have to pay upfront, like it is in most industries in the US. But it also feels weird to me that this ruling was only applied to the air travel industry. reply arp242 21 hours agoprevDupe from yesterday:Last Chance to fix eIDAS: Secret EU law threatens Internet security - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38109494 - Nov 2023 (280 comments) reply vaylian 19 hours agoparentThat&#x27;s a related but different page on the same topic reply arp242 19 hours agorootparentIt has the letter literally in the first sentence.

This is the preference that was added back in the day to control if the browser will allow root certificates added to the OS no matter the source (user or system context) and now they change it to true by default. I think this provides more clarity but feel free to search the affected code for references that indicate that only part of the root certificate store is trusted reply xoa 11 hours agorootparentLate so don&#x27;t if you will see this, but from the very beginning, the security.enterprise_roots.enabled preference always stated it applied to certificates added, not those included by default, eg [0]. System vs User context is still different from baked-in vs added. On macOS for example the System keychain contains certificates added that are then accessible by all users and can only be added by an Administrator, and the separate System Roots keychain holds the root certificates (151 on the Mac I&#x27;m sitting in front of) that Apple ships with the OS. Firefox reading from both the \"login\" and \"System\" keychains doesn&#x27;t mean reading from \"System Roots\". The suggested release notes for the bug report you linked reinforces this [1] (capitalization emphasis added):>[Suggested wording]: By default, Firefox will now use TLS trust anchors (e.g., certificates) ADDED to the operating system by the user or an administrator. This works on Windows, macOS, and Android, and it can be turned off in the \"Privacy & Security\" section of Firefox settings, under \"Certificates\".If you think all of these descriptions have been wrong all along from the code, that&#x27;d definitely be worth bringing up on Bugzilla. Personally I&#x27;m happy to have it enabled by default vs always needing to remember to do so if it&#x27;s working as described. I think support for one&#x27;s own CAs should be encouraged even the overall UX around running your own CA is mediocre right now.----0: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;kb&#x2F;how-disable-enterprise-... :>\"Mozilla has added an Enterprise Roots preference to Firefox as a solution to the problem.

'15 A colorized image of the newly discovered satellite virus latched onto its helper virus. This research represents the first time scientists have observed one virus attached to another. (Image by Tagide deCarvalho) No one had ever seen one virus latching onto another virus, until anomalous sequencing results sent a UMBC team down a rabbit hole leading to a first-of-its-kind discovery. It’s known that some viruses, called satellites, depend not only on their host organism to complete their life cycle, but also on another virus, known as a “helper,” explains Ivan Erill, professor of biological sciences. The satellite virus needs the helper either to build its capsid, a protective shell that encloses the virus’s genetic material, or to help it replicate its DNA. These viral relationships require the satellite and the helper to be in proximity to each other at least temporarily, but there were no known cases of a satellite actually attaching itself to a helper—until now. In a paper published in the Journal of the International Society of Microbial Ecology, a UMBC team and colleagues from Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) describe the first observation of a satellite bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacterial cells) consistently attaching to a helper bacteriophage at its “neck”—where the capsid joins the tail of the virus. In detailed electron microscopy images taken by Tagide deCarvalho, assistant director of the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences core facilities and first author on the new paper, 80 percent (40 out of 50) helpers had a satellite bound at the neck. Some of those that did not had remnant satellite tendrils present at the neck. Erill, senior author on the paper, describes them as appearing like “bite marks.” “When I saw it, I was like, ‘I can’t believe this,’” deCarvalho says. “No one has ever seen a bacteriophage—or any other virus—attach to another virus.” Tagide deCarvalho in the Keith R. Porter Imaging Facility. deCarvalho took advantage of the facility’s transmission electron microscope (TEM) to capture striking images of the satellite-helper virus system discussed in the new paper. (Marlayna Demond ’11/UMBC) A long-term virus relationship After the initial observations, Elia Mascolo, a graduate student in Erill‘s research group and co-first author on the paper, analyzed the genomes of the satellite, helper, and host, which revealed further clues about this never-before-seen viral relationship. Most satellite viruses contain a gene that allows them to integrate into the host cell’s genetic material after they enter the cell. This allows the satellite to reproduce whenever a helper happens to enter the cell from then on. The host cell also copies the satellite’s DNA along with its own when it divides. Ivan Erill co-leads the SEA-PHAGES program at UMBC. His research group focuses on bioinformatics. (Image by Marlayna Demond ’11/UMBC) A bacteriophage sample from WashU also contained a helper and a satellite. The WashU satellite has a gene for integration and does not directly attach to its helper, similar to previously observed satellite-helper systems. However, the satellite in UMBC’s sample, named MiniFlayer by the students who isolated it, is the first known case of a satellite with no gene for integration. Because it can’t integrate into the host cell’s DNA, it must be near its helper—named MindFlayer—every time it enters a host cell if it is going to survive. Given that, although the team did not directly prove this explanation, “Attaching now made total sense,” Erill says, “because otherwise, how are you going to guarantee that you are going to enter into the cell at the same time?” Additional bioinformatics analysis by Mascolo and Julia López-Pérez, another Ph.D. student working with Erill, revealed that MindFlayer and MiniFlayer have been co-evolving for a long time. “This satellite has been tuning in and optimizing its genome to be associated with the helper for, I would say, at least 100 million years,” Erill says, which suggests there may be many more cases of this kind of relationship waiting to be discovered. Contamination or discovery? This groundbreaking discovery could easily have been missed. The project started out as a typical semester in the SEA-PHAGES program—an investigative curriculum where undergraduates isolate bacteriophages from environmental samples, send them out for sequencing, and then use bioinformatics tools to analyze the results. When the sequencing lab at the University of Pittsburgh reported contamination in the sample from UMBC expected to contain the MindFlayer phage, the journey began. Steven Caruso co-leads the SEA-PHAGES program at UMBC. He also conducts pedagogy research to improve science education. (Marlayna Demond ’11/UMBC) The sample included one large sequence: the phage they expected. “But instead of just finding that, we also found a small sequence, which didn’t map to anything we knew,” says Erill, who is also one of the leads for UMBC’s SEA-PHAGES program, called Phage Hunters, along with Steven Caruso, principal lecturer of biological sciences. Caruso ’94, Ph.D. ’02, biological sciences, ran the isolation again, sent it out for sequencing—and got identical results. That’s when the team pulled in deCarvalho to get a visual of what was going on with the transmission electron microscope (TEM) at UMBC’s Keith R. Porter Imaging Facility (KPIF). Without the images, the discovery would have been impossible. “Not everyone has a TEM at their disposal,” deCarvalho notes. But with the instruments at the KPIF, deCarvalho says, “I’m able to follow up on some of these observations and validate them with imaging. There’s elements of discovery we can only make using the TEM.” The team’s discovery sets the stage for future work to figure out how the satellite attaches, how common this phenomenon is, and much more. “It’s possible that a lot of the bacteriophages that people thought were contaminated were actually these satellite-helper systems,” deCarvalho says. “So now, with this paper, people might be able to recognize more of these systems.” Tags: Biology, CNMS, Research Share this Story Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn Reddit Share Related Posts Alumni Alumni Awards 2023—Making impact through relationships Science & Tech UMBC’s Vandana Janeja aims to boost high-performance computing know-how to tackle environmental science challenges with a $1 million NSF grant Policy & Society The Academic Minute: Democratizing access to digital tools in the documentation of the Innu language Want more UMBC news?

Cells are much much bigger than viruses. The things in your body that are the same size as viruses also do not have a metabolism.It&#x27;s sort of like there&#x27;s an engine in your car. But there&#x27;s not an engine in your engine, there are just parts that together make an engine. None of those parts have car-ness, but together they do. Your car has many parts all working together to make a comfortable and useful car. But the parts of the car if they are separated and just sitting on the bench, just sit there.Viruses are like those parts, car parts. When they are not in a cell, they just sit there. But if a virus part gets into your car, it gets to participate in the metabolism of the whole car, by acting like one of the other parts and just contributing its part-in-the-system. Unfortunately, the virus part&#x27;s part-in-the-system is to turn your car into a factory&#x2F;machine that makes more virus parts. This is how it spreads. This is why you do not want to get a virus.In this news story, a virus that is missing a piece of how to be a functioning part in your car, attaches to another virus that has that missing piece, and together they behave like a part that knows how to become one of your car parts. reply earthboundkid 14 hours agorootparent“You, sir, have been reared in great luxury as becomes your noble birth.

The HIV virus can only be passed directly from one person to another in moist body fluids, and not \"through\" normal dry skin. From this we can see why cold and flu spread so easily, and even though HIV does not, it still has very little trouble finding pathways to transmit.early in Covid, it was unknown how it spread.

What percentage of the populace refuses to don a mask?Answering these questions truthfully would provide a better coverage graph and allow researchers to find ways to increase the coverage and educate the public accordingly. reply fsckboy 14 hours agorootparentI was not trying to answer or even ask the mask question, I was using something the newbies (to virology) here would already be familiar with to point out that even though we know a good bit about viruses, experts still don&#x27;t automatically know things like \"how does this virus propagate\", it takes time to tease out the answers and they don&#x27;t always come.It&#x27;s a bit like yesterday&#x27;s story here about massive amounts of evaporation of water occurring by a mechanism that science never knew about, just to point out that there is much to know that we don&#x27;t know yet, and not to go deeper into evaporation where science is already struggling. reply jagraff 14 hours agorootparentprevMovement without energy is possible due to diffusion. Imagine you had a room with cellophane separating one side from another. Each side has a different gas, but both gasses are at the same pressure and at room temperature. Then, the cellophane is removed. Without adding any energy to the system, these gasses will mix until the whole room is a perfect mixture of the two gasses, simply because they both diffuse through the entire room. Something similar happens to allow viruses to move through your body (and, if they can be aerosolized, through the air). reply IIAOPSW 10 hours agorootparentprevUsing the analogy, they are like loose screws or other basic machine parts that fell down the pipe, got in the engine, jammed a bunch of things cause they aren&#x27;t supposed to be there, and consequently a bunch more misc scrap metal got sneezed out the exhaust pipe. reply JadoJodo 15 hours agorootparentprevThis analogy was really great.

Also, all of the interactions that I&#x27;ve read about between virophages and phages occur inside of a prokaryotic cell, where there are plenty of molecules for making more viruses and powering chemical reactions.Honestly I&#x27;m not sure what to recommend you in terms of books. When I was a biology undergrad I had a biochemistry textbook that, at the time, I found to be mostly inscrutable. Then as a grad student I was going back through it to refresh my memory for a class I was TAing and remarked, \"this is incredibly straightforward and clear\" and immediately realized how much I must have changed. All of this to say - learning biology via text is pretty hard and takes a long time. I&#x27;ve never used it, but smart biology (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smart-biology.com&#x2F;) looks very promising.I think the biggest way that the field of biology fails humanity is that we communicate relationships between these incredibly complex machines with little cartoons of a circle and triangle bumping into each other or something like that. Once you get the intuition for how things behave on a molecular level it&#x27;s a super efficient means of communicating, but for people joining the field it&#x27;s just brutal.But if you want to understand viruses you really need to understand biochemistry and molecular biology first. If you already have that background then I can ask around for book recommendations, if not, I would try smart biology, or if you really want a book, Lehninger is the classic biochemistry book, Alberts Molecular Biology of the cell is the classic cell biology book. These aren&#x27;t intro books though, you typically wouldn&#x27;t get them until your 2nd or 3rd year in a university program.

A storm swirls trash among them, though trash doesn&#x27;t last long in the wind and wet. Your goal is to create steady-state trash.So you design a packet. An envelope with tape (so it sticks when blown against glass front doors), and an address label (to get it carried inside, rather than being ignored as trash, or trashed as spam). And then you fold that envelope around hopefully-persuasive instructions for photocopying envelope and instructions, and assembling new packets. Then you make a lot of them. Few will reach doors, few will get inside, few will be executed.There are a bunch of design tradeoffs. The address can spam or spear-fish. A \" Trucking\" address works well with trucking companies, and poorly with others. A \" Accounts Dept\" works less well, but more broadly. You can include helpful envelope folding templates, but that means making fewer larger packets with more to go wrong when assembling them. You can go for stealth, only one person in the corner making packets and tossing them out the window, or even getting the instructions inserted into to the company process manual. Or you can go for fast private-equity zombie-apocalypse takeover, where the whole company dedicates itself to production until it explodes, scattering scads of packets to the wind. Zombies are the common case. Our human genome manual is littered with inserts.You might put an inter-departmental envelope within the envelope with a specific destination - trading lack of generality for performance. You might include a photocopier how to - buying \"no worries, I&#x27;ve brought my own\" generality at a cost of size and complexity. But the complexity budget is tight. Each extra badly-photocopied page ups the odds of a broken packet.Offices don&#x27;t want to become zombies. So they keep their sprinklers running, to degrade packet trash. They toss out port-a-potties that feel like front doors to decoy packets. People run around the office with scissors, chopping up paper that looks spamish - you might want your instructions to fire them early on. Employees refuse instructions that don&#x27;t look right. Out of common cause with sister offices, if someone notices the office going zombie, they may pull a fire alarm, burning down the office. It&#x27;s a hard hard life being spam. And not easy being an office either.Looking out over a shallow coastal city... it&#x27;s a burning trash-filled hellscape warzone. The half-life of functional packets is like an hour. The half-life of bacterial office buildings is only a couple of days.Asides: Some envelopes can punch a hole through the door to inject instructions. The time between insertion and resistance-is-only-a-delaying-action can be short - seconds to minutes. The zombie buildings explode within an hour or day.> how do these satellite viruses then survive off of other viruses?Small and simple, and easy to build, are nice design goals. As simple as possible but no simpler - taking over offices is hard after all. But what if the office is already being taken over, by someone else? The C-suite has been sent golfing, and the scissor snippers fired. Now in that altered environment, your even simpler or more general instructions might survive and grab a slice of production, or even takeover the takeover. Parasite parasites. Think of the ecological interactions of memes - \"I might not have believedyesterday, but now, after encounteringthis morning...\". And if two different packet designs are being photocopied at the same time, hey, mixups happen. Or consider a label of \"Important Mandatory Instructions from the Fire Marshall - OPEN IMMEDIATELY\" - highly persuasive... when someone else is causing nearby offices to burn down.

DANIEL ACKER—BLOOMBERG VIA GETTY IMAGES A California jury has awarded $332 million to a man who sued chemical giant Monsanto Co. contending that his cancer was related to decades of using its Roundup weedkiller. A San Diego Superior Court jury awarded damages Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by Mike Dennis, 57, of Carlsbad. He was diagnosed in 2020 with a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. His lawsuit contended that his illness was related to Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate. Dennis had treatment and has been in remission for nearly three years but there is no cure, Adam Peavy, one of his attorneys, told KNSD-TV. “His doctors have told him it’s going to come back and we’re just waiting to see if that happens,” Peavy said. The jury found that Monsanto, which is now a division of pharmaceutical and biotechnology giant Bayer, failed to provide warnings of Roundup’s risks. But jurors also ruled partially in Bayer’s favor by finding the product design wasn’t defective and the company wasn’t negligent. Dennis was awarded $7 million in compensatory damages and $325 million in punitive damages. In a statement to KNSD-TV, Bayer said it believes “we have strong arguments on appeal to get this unfounded verdict overturned and the unconstitutionally excessive damage award eliminated or reduced.” “There were significant and reversible legal and evidentiary errors made during this trial,” Bayer added. Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018 and has been trying to deal with thousands of claims and lawsuits related to Roundup. In 2020, Bayer announced it would pay up to $10.9 billion to settle some 125,000 filed and unfiled claims.

If Roundup is responsible for this person&#x27;s cancer, it&#x27;s almost certainly responsible for the cancer of many other people, alive and dead. Clearly I am not a lawyer, but in cases of such a finding, I feel like there ought to be some mechanism to identify an affected class, and make proceeds benefit that class. The alternative seems to be that the first individual plaintiff whose judgement drains the defendant of funds pulls resources from later plaintiffs whose case is just as sound. reply j-bos 9 hours agoparentGenerally the first plaintiff (attorney) takes the greatest risk as there&#x27;s no precedent of guilt. Afterwards the class action suits ride the single case momentum towards relatively easy payouts. reply loeg 9 hours agoparentprevSometimes companies attempt to achieve this fair resolution using bankruptcy courts. And then people get mad about that, too. reply Zigurd 10 hours agoparentprevReforming how class actions are done is probably a very good idea. But Bayer has a market capitalization of over 45 billion. This judgement will probably get appealed and negotiated down. And if it isn&#x27;t, there is a lot of value in Bayer to pay out in a class action if one succeeds. reply rudyfink 8 hours agorootparentIf by \"reform\" you mean weaken class actions, I would argue that is a bad idea.Larger businesses have already gone to great lengths to eliminate &#x2F; curtail class actions.I&#x27;d argue that this weakening is the root cause of a chunk of the aggregate problems I see discussed on HN.It is in a company&#x27;s interest to harm a great many people a little bit because the people often have to challenge the company as individuals rather than as a group. And the economics often make no sense in that way, so the company is functionally immune to the effects of its harm.Further weakening the remaining viability of that case type stands to only encourage companies to commit more aggregate harms. reply underwater 7 hours agorootparentIn other countries this is addressed by government regulation. The US prefers to use class action lawsuits and punitive damages. reply robertlagrant 7 hours agorootparentprevBusinesses aren&#x27;t trying to harm. They aren&#x27;t a Mao or a Stalin just going for The Greater Good no matter how many people they have to kill. They&#x27;re trying to make a profit, and sometimes horribly unethical people in those businesses will not care about harm in order to make a profit. But the goal isn&#x27;t harm. reply rudyfink 6 hours agorootparentTo be clear, I was not suggesting the intent was harm for harm&#x27;s sake. I was suggesting that it was in the company&#x27;s&#x2F;businesses&#x27; interest to harm. I agree that, often, that interest is framed as making profit, but it can also be framed as reducing cost, not having to care, etc.The bigger point is that such an incentive exists and that it is further incentivized if the individuals who are harmed are deprived of a mechanism to resist. reply hinkley 7 hours agorootparentprevMonsanto is the main culprit here. I don’t know how they convinced Bayer to buy them and tale on this albatross. reply w10-1 9 hours agoprevThe judgment was based on failure to warn of risk, not negligence in design.On causation, as far as I can tell, the 2015 finding of epidemiological evidence for a 41% increase in non-hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) was rebutted by non-affiliated researchers, but paid experts are continuing to publish, and claim others have recently found a mechanism. But AFAIK there&#x27;s no epidemiological or mechanistic proof, now or at the time they made warnings. (I would assume a failure to warn requires some proof they knew of the risk?)In this case, 57 is barely on the young side of the affected population, but decades of exposure is hard to overlook.Warnings are something of a fiction. Detailed legalese is regularly ignored, and if it&#x27;s unclear any commercial gardener avoids glyphosate even today after all the scary news. But the hugely differential impact is a legitimate environmental justice concern, and the lawsuits might be the tip of the iceberg.It would be best if Monsanto&#x2F;Bayer negotiated a pool to pay affected people and more importantly to do outreach and monitoring for those who might be affected.The incentives are all wrong here: huge 100X punitive damages based on failure to warn when there&#x27;s no proven risk just make any rational decision-makers dig in if not suppress research. It&#x27;d be better for companies to pitch in for investigations and treatment over the lifecycle of the product, in exchange for protection from legal lotteries. reply dehrmann 4 hours agoparentI&#x27;m surprised these judgements are happening.

Nature does that all day.But when chemicals so awful they kill the crop, the crop’s genes need to be modified so that they don’t die and that chemical residue ends up all over our food system, well buddy, get me off this stupid crazy train.I hope the settlement hits trillions.

But corn is where the money is.. reply cyberax 7 hours agorootparent> pesticide use is lower...It&#x27;s not.

Sure, the collective can achieve sufficient production with less use of these chemicals however when a farm is at a point where their plants are touching each other then serious pesticides are required if they wish to increase their yield further without pests becoming a catastrophic risk to the entire operation.

The main reason im concerned with roundup is because it has now become common to finish crops by spraying them with roundup so they all dry up at the same time on a set schedule, which means they are harvesting within days after spraying them, then storing that grain in sunless silos with reduced moisture and drying so that roundup never has a chance to degrade.I would have no problem eating something that was hit with roundup 2 months previously and exposed to the elements.

The vast majority of soybeans in the world are running Roundup-ready genes for a reason.Terminator seeds sounded like a scary patent, but it was mostly useless. In corn, for instance, you&#x27;d never want to run it at all, as the seeds that are sold are almost perfect hybrids of 2 inbreds, which lose a whole lot of yield in the next generation without anyone really trying. There&#x27;s no need for a gene when the next generation yields worse naturally.If you want a sick situation with Bayer, forget Roundup, and look at what&#x27;s been happening with Dicamba, the next generation of pesticide that GMOs are protected from. It&#x27;s not a new pesticide, but it&#x27;s very aggressive and it drifts: You spray a field, and many other fields around it are going to get hit. Supposedly Bayer is telling everyone that, on tests, the new formulations of it, when applied properly under the right weather conditions, there&#x27;s no drift... but reality disagrees. Therefore, a whole lot of fields that aren&#x27;t planting seeds protected from dicamba are getting wrecked by not-so-close that haven&#x27;t mastered the really difficult ways to spray dicamba in the calmest of days. We aren&#x27;t talking a pesticide that drifts 50 feet here, or 100, but people relatively far away that have their crops ruined. This is happening often enough that we&#x27;ll see bans, while more and more generations of roundup GMO are going out of patent.I am pretty sure that this one is what is scaring Bayer&#x27;s lawyers, not Roundup. reply BenjiWiebe 7 hours agorootparentprevWikipedia claims (not very current claims though) that terminator seeds are not commercially available?They are different than the common case of infertile hybrids, which have good reason to exist and the infertility (IIUIC, not a botanist) is a side effect. reply throw3823423 7 hours agorootparentThere was an old patent about making generations completely infertile, but yes, never used.

I would say the question is not about how GMOs and glyphosate compare to the usual alternatives, but how they compare to the possibilities. Heavy reliance on glyphosate has notable environmental consequences, but it is so cheap and convenient that its use is widespread. To be honest since I am focused on regenerative organic, I can&#x27;t speak much to what conventional farming methods were like before the use of GMO&#x27;d glyphosate resistant crops as I have not studied them, but they would have been more labor intensive. So these GMO crops did make farming cheaper in some ways (tho now farmers pay huge fees to Bayer née Monsanto), but it is important to ask what the trade offs are for this.Long term, my hope is that small scale farming robot swarms can manage crops the way a more traditional regenerative organic farmer would tend to their crops. In those systems there is more attention paid to each plant, and little to no artificial inputs.

Thanks replythrow3823423 7 hours agorootparentprevNo modification is perfect: While all GMO modification tries to be as narrow as possible, it&#x27;s not like things are ever so perfectly narrow as to only just express a bonus protein that you wanted.The problem is assuming that any other change that happens is dangerous and untested. There&#x27;s mutation all over the place in perfectly organic plants, just like with GMOs. There are also changes on gene expression from those changes, also like GMO. An overwhelming majority of changes either do nothing, or make the plant unviable at all. The practical risks of a change that does something, doesn&#x27;t harm yields, and yet somehow makes the parts of the plant that a human eats somewhat toxic is a huge stretch. It&#x27;s even less likely when one considers the actual regulatory processes that happen later. It might seem crazy, but people that work on GMOs tend to be uninterested in poisoning the public.If I was afraid of poisoning due to mutation (which I am not), I&#x27;d be more afraid of what someone that has been crossing plans with some localized, ancestral wildtypes that have been planted just in some village for the last hundred years or something. They are more likely to be untested. But it&#x27;s like the risk of getting hit by lighting for the 5th time this week.I am far more likely to be poisoned by a detergent, or someone that has let bacteria run amok in their packing facility, and is somehow selling, say, premixed salads that land in my local supermarket. reply lll-o-lll 6 hours agorootparentI’d argue back, but I’m too ignorant.

Given the cost, it makes little financial sense to waste it on non-target plants.And while nearly any pesticide&#x2F;herbicide&#x2F;fungicide will tell you to suit up and use a respirator, it’s usually because of the (often petroleum derived) volatiles used in the mixture to ensure stability and proper spreading rather than the active ingredient itself.Glyphosate (RoundUp) for example interacts with a biochemical pathway that doesn’t even exist in humans, yet still suffers from the legacy and cultural entrenchment of a paper that has since been refuted and retracted. The infamous “roundup causes cancer” paper where the author used lines of lab rats that were (intentionally, for use in cancer studies) genetically predisposed to developing tumours.The volatiles evaporate and break down rapidly, which is why a freshly sprayed field will have an odd aroma for several hours after application. Meanwhile these sprays come with a PHI (post harvest interval), whereby if a producer is following laws and regulations, the active ingredient itself is virtually undetectable at the time of harvest due to UV&#x2F;heat&#x2F;microbial degradation.PHIs are determined empirically by testing sprays across environments and conditions for years before certification, then still including a buffer period to account for outlier conditions where a chemical may persist beyond what was observed. reply jcranmer 8 hours agorootparentprevBecause people see \"wear standard PPE\" in an MSDS and think \"it&#x27;s unsafe if you&#x27;re not wearing a hazmat suit!\" and not \"this is safe.\" Here&#x27;s the MSDS for good old table salt: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fscimage.fishersci.com&#x2F;msds&#x2F;21105.htmQuoting the PPE section:> Personal Protective Equipment> Eyes: Wear appropriate protective eyeglasses or chemical safety goggles as described by OSHA&#x27;s eye and face protection regulations in 29 CFR 1910.133 or European Standard EN166.> Skin: Wear appropriate protective gloves to prevent skin exposure.> Clothing: Wear appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin exposure.> Respirators: A respiratory protection program that meets OSHA&#x27;s 29 CFR 1910.134 and ANSI Z88.2 requirements or European Standard EN 149 must be followed whenever workplace conditions warrant respirator use.This is table salt.

Way higher levels of exposure than any foods. Also if you&#x27;re afraid of glyphosate, the Roundup-ready crops are the ones to avoid especially - soy, corn, canola, sugar beets. There&#x27;s no Roundup-ready wheat, oats, or nuts. (edit: apparently it&#x27;s used as a desiccant so it winds up in cereals as well - lovely, though still there&#x27;s no evidence it&#x27;s got dietary effects).I&#x27;m not really concerned about its dietary effects since there&#x27;s no evidence there, but as an amateur entomologist the effects of Roundup on butterfly populations have been devastating - in the past milkweed was pretty hard to completely weed out by hand, but modern farming can clear hundreds of acres of every trace of milkweed with Roundup&#x2F;glyphosate. reply szundi 10 hours agorootparentLiving in eastern europe I have not seen butterflies for decades. Now they seem to be returning a bit. reply nemo 8 hours agorootparentI keep records of butterfly sightings. This is the worst year I&#x27;ve ever seen by far. In a normal year queen butterflies are one of the most abundant migrants. So far I have seen 0. I&#x27;ve seen no swallowtails of any species at all, and massively reduced numbers of typical species or none. But that&#x27;s because of the drought, not glyphosate. reply moberley 10 hours agorootparentprevGlyphosate is sometimes used a pre-harvest dessicant with cereal crops like wheat in which case the Roundup Ready gene is not required. reply 1letterunixname 9 hours agorootparentThe Wikipedia datalinks opines it&#x27;s a practice banned in Austria and frowned upon by buyers in Canada.Spraying chemicals on crops to make them cheaper to harvest is enough evidence to convince me it&#x27;s best to avoid all cereal products unless they&#x27;re organic. reply Zigurd 10 hours agorootparentprevRoundup is used to dessicate some crops to make harvesting more efficient. reply cracrecry 10 hours agoparentprevThey probably do not have that high concentration on seeds itself. The problem is that it thousands of tons need to be dispersed on the environment and its effect as an antibiotic on big scale.We have a very important microbiota that are bacteria themselves. The antibiotics on meat and environment can break havoc there, specially for people that work or live near those environments and can breathe or drink the pesticides. reply Loughla 9 hours agorootparentDoes glyphosate act as an antibiotic? This is literally news to me. It&#x27;s a weed killer? reply sitharus 9 hours agorootparentGlyphosate is toxic to some bacteria as they use the same enzyme as part of amino acid synthesis. It’s not a universal antibiotic. reply hinkley 7 hours agorootparentprevOur digestive tracts aren’t fond of detergents either, and Roundup contains some. For that matter, so do the pods you use in your dishwasher, which is something that just came onto my radar recently. Are HE dishwashers removing enough detergent residue during the rinse cycle? Possibly not. reply jancsika 6 hours agorootparentAre you talking about this?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;36464527&#x2F;If so, that study appears to point to rinse aid as the culprit in the damage, not the detergent. reply 1letterunixname 9 hours agorootparentprevMight be conflating different issues.I haven&#x27;t seen the data or reporting on glyphosate residues.

Glyphosate is one of the more heavily studied chemicals known to man.2. The evidence for it causing cancer is poor. Studies routinely fail to find evidence for it.3. The subset of studies that do find evidence for such a link, find it in occupational exposure, by people who have been working knee-deep in it for decades.

The minutes ..shows that officials knew that haemophiliacs were being given dangerous blood from the US that was making them ill with hepatitis... No one raised the alarm to stop the spread of the blood and instead, officials hoped the imported goods would not get a \"bad name\".There was a major effort to supress this information. People has to extrapolate based on limited data.These situations are not rare - when the workers in Teflon factories were having birth defects and cancers, and started questioning that maybe it&#x27;s related to their job, they were called crazy too.In my family we extrapolated based on limited data, twice, and doctors were looking at us like we were crazy, and it turned out we were right.

Our food is loaded with chemicals that can make you sick or even cause cancer [2]. That age is also when people usually retire and are no longer \"productive\".Here&#x27;s where I might lose you. In our country, illness is a way to make money [3]. If you&#x27;re really sick and trying to stay alive, you&#x27;ll spend everything you&#x27;ve got. So the quickest way to turn people&#x27;s savings into profit while also reducing the population of non-productive people is for them to fall ill, pay as much as they can to survive and then ultimately die an early death, which triggers a death tax event [4].1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cancer.gov&#x2F;about-cancer&#x2F;causes-prevention&#x2F;risk&#x2F;a...2. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eatthis.com&#x2F;toxic-food-ingredients-linked-to-can...3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;brucejapsen&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;13&#x2F;unitedhe...4. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;terms&#x2F;d&#x2F;death-taxes.asp reply sharts 8 hours agorootparentThe other aspect might be that people in their 60s also don&#x27;t eat diets to replenish things that they&#x27;ve been losing since their 20&#x27;s.Similarly to how so many people that died from covid tended toward very low vitamin D levels [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.plos.org&#x2F;plosone&#x2F;article?id=10.1371&#x2F;journal...]Most \"medical\" research tends to never focus on actual nutrition.

I don&#x27;t know but hearing about the various trials and studies of roundup just make me feel so helpless. How would I even go about helping his widow and children get justice? I don&#x27;t want to encourage litigious behavior but man if there&#x27;s a pair of companies that deserve litigiousness it&#x27;s Bayer and Monsanto reply cactusfrog 1 hour agoparentWhat’s strange about this case is that there are lot of carcinogens and evil pesticides out there that are not heavily regulated. For example processed meat has a very strong link with cancer and the nitrites added to processed meat are likely the culprit. No one seems to care and no one is suing the meat companies. There are “export only” pesticides that are truly scary that contaminate the us food supply and cause birth defects and cancer for entire villages. Roundup isn’t mechanistically tied to cancer and there isn’t a scientific consensus surrounding if&#x2F;how carcinogenic it is. I wouldn’t be surprised if your brother’s cancer was environmentally related but I would bet that a boring chemical like gasoline&#x2F;exhaust would be the cause. Gasoline and exhaust products are known to be carcinogenic. reply MisterBastahrd 8 hours agoparentprevI grew up in the shadow of the Monsanto plant that makes most of the world&#x27;s Roundup.

But wait... there's so much more! Onboarding: Guided setup and configuration of Podman and Compose Podman 4.7.2: Podman 4.7.2 is now included in Windows and Mac installers Command Palette: Gain easy access to various commands via a new keyboard-driven command palette Expanded \"Summary\" tab for Kubernetes pods: Go deep with extended details on Kubernetes pods in the pod \"Summary\" tab Environment file support: Chart out environment variables for new containers to access on creation Enhancements to the Settings area: Get your bearings with improved Docker compatibility mode controls Improved user experience for state changes: No more dead reckoning on container state with improved visual indication of status Extension API improvements: A boatload of improvements to the extension API enabling more goodness from 🦭 Podman Desktop's extensions Podman Desktop 1.5 is now available. Click here to download it! Release Details Onboarding We are introducing a new feature providing guided flows for the initial setup of specific 🦭 Podman Desktop extensions. Release 1.5 features two new onboarding flows: Podman, and Compose. To start the Podman onboarding flow, you can start from the dashboard notification by clicking the \"Set up\" button: Visit Settings > Resources screen and click the Compose \"Setup ...\" button in order to start Compose onboarding: Command Palette A new, search-driven command palette is now available to enable quick access to various commands available across 🦭 Podman Desktop. You can try this new tool out by hitting the F1 key. #4081 && #3979 Expanded \"Summary\" tab for Kubernetes pods Kubernetes pods now offer a more comprehensive set of information under the \"Summary\" tab, including networking, volumes, environment variables, and other key metadata. Environment file support When creating a container from the Images list, there's now an option to provide an environment file to set env variables for the new container. #4026 && #4025 Enhancements to the Settings area The user experience for enabling or disabling Docker compatibility is improved, with a new entry in the Settings > Preferences screen that includes contextual guidance. #4093 Improved user experience for state changes The user experience around state changes for containers, pods, and other objects in the UI is improved, with clear status messages and improved animated visual indicator of state changes. #4056 Extension API improvements The 🦭 Podman Desktop extension API received many improvements, including: In addition to pushing and listing image from an extension, it's now possible to pull images from a 🦭 Podman Desktop extension #4155 The 🦭 Podman Desktop extension API has been enhanced with both the ability to list images & networks and the ability to create containers & networks. #4172 🦭 Podman Desktop extensions now have a consistent way to run administrative tasks. #4049 Extensions now have the ability to register a custom Kubernetes config generator. #3970 The ability of extensions to add commands to UI menus has been extended; previously for action menus it was only available in the Image list screen. It is now possible for extensions to add commands to the action menus of items listed on the Containers list screen as well. #3947 & #3963 Extensions have gained the ability to contribute menu items in the UI based on specific conditions. #3959 Enhanced logic for displaying or hiding properties listed under the Settings > Preferences screens is now available. #4159 Other Notable Enhancements The progress of loading an image into Kind is now visible as a task in the task manager. #4061 It's now possible to start a new Podman machine right after creation, or you can create it and wait to start it later. It's up to you! #4046 The Podman machine and Kubernetes provider creation forms have an updated look & feel consisted with other forms in the user interface, along with minor bug fixes. #4317 The empty screen message shown when a search filter results in no matches now provides a message specific to filter matching, including the specific filter terms and an explicit button for clearing the filter. Previously, the screen displayed a generic message about how to create new objects of the type displayed on the screen, which led to some confusion about the status of the system. #3988 New support for adding spin animations to icons is now available. #4188 There is a new indeterminate progress bar type available for the task manager; this is meant for providing limited status for actions whose APIs do not provide detailed status information. #4016 For authenticating as admin to perform administrative tasks, 🦭 Podman Desktop now provides touchID support for macOS. #4050 Support for connecting to interactive terminals for containers via tty was added. #3900 It's now more clear which container/pod providers will autostart when 🦭 Podman Desktop starts. Previously autostart had both a global and a per-provider setting. It has been simplified by removing the global setting. #3840 The \"Working with containers\" section of the documentation has been reworked and improved. #3951 Notable Bug Fixes The disable registry command was not blocking subsequent pulls from disabled registries. This has been corrected. #4183 Some users behind network proxies were unable to complete workflow involving the download of online resources. The mechanism for fetching these resources has been fixed to be proxy compatible to address this issue. #3994 The status of pods running in Kubernetes that are undergoing the deletion process is now accurately reflected in the 🦭 Podman Desktop UI. #3877 The image details page always listed the image as being \"not used\" even when it was. This has been corrected. #3985 Previously, deleting a specific image tag would cause all tags with the same Image ID to be deleted. This has been fixed so only the selected image tag will be deleted. #3837 Could not view the pod details for some remote Kubernetes cluster pods due to an encoding error. #4371 Error logs were being tracked separately from the actions they applied to. This has been addressed for kind cluster creation failure #4427 and Compose installation failure #4407. 🦭 Podman Desktop previously did not appear under the \"Development\" menu when installed via Flatpak; it appeared under \"Utilities.\" 🦭 Podman Desktop now appears under the \"Development\" menu. #3911 Podman Machine names are no longer prefixed with the \"Podman Machine\" string. #3878 The initial action state of pods and containers was being displayed as \"STARTING\" regardless of actual state; this has been corrected. #3889 Resizing the application window no longer makes the last lines of a container's terminal invisible. #3993 An issue with incorrect terminal behavior in response to long lines in the terminal attached to a container has been resolved. #3955 A spacing issue on the run image form has been corrected. [#4089]https://github.com/containers/podman-desktop/pull/4089 The \"podify\" icon & button on the Containers list was unusually large in release 1.4. That regression has been corrected in this release. #4122 An error in the instructions for Windows users on migrating from Docker has been corrected. #4157 Community Thank You 🎉 We’d like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to make 🦭 Podman Desktop even better.

I still use the docker runtime in it (the non-proprietary part) but it also supports containerd. On Mac it&#x27;s just a \"brew install colima\" and then \"colima start\"I also install the compose and ecr credentials plug-ins (since I use ecr for my container registry.) It has the full functionality of docker desktop minus the UI, which I never used anyways.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;abiosoft&#x2F;colima reply gigatexal 2 hours agoparentI moved from the Mac platform for all the hoops you have to run though to run containers. On Linux I can do it without a VM. (I also hated window management — hello Sway — and the hardware is cheaper).I’ve moved from Docker to podman as well on Linux. Love it. reply magic_hamster 52 minutes agorootparentIsn&#x27;t rosetta a sort of middle ground with pretty good performance? reply thfuran 51 minutes agorootparentDocker on Mac runs a Linux VM to put containers in. Rosetta doesn&#x27;t get around that. reply kwkelly 1 minute agorootparentNotable too that the VM it runs on Mac comes with qemu user mode emulation and uses binfmt_misc to run binaries for different architectures so obviates the need for Rosetta. tacker2000 41 minutes agoparentprevI tried to use colima instead of Docker Desktop several months ago on my Mac, but I ran into several difficult issues (i think relating to folder mounts) and gave up. reply aequitas 2 hours agoparentprevI&#x27;ve been using Colima for the past few months now instead of Docker for Mac and it&#x27;s running great. Only issue I experience is that there is sometimes a delay after saving before files are synced to the container (using volumes), so when you run a test directly after saving it will still use the old file, or even worse, files that are still in transit, so you have to run your test again a few seconds later.Been using Orbstack now for a few days and it seems to not have the same file syncing issue, and is faster in every other regard compared to Docker for Mac or Colima. reply mplanchard 7 hours agoparentprevWe tried to use podman at work (via nix) and ran into all kinds of confusing issues, especially in regards to docker in docker and CI builds. Swapped to using colima (again via nix) for the mac folks and regular docker engine for linux, and things have been much smoother. Definitely recommended if your podman setup is as difficult as ours was. reply drzaiusx11 6 hours agorootparentWe also attempted to move to Podman, but it just wasn&#x27;t ready at the time. Since colima works well for our use case (devs with MacBooks), we haven&#x27;t had a compelling reason to try Podman again reply tecoholic 5 hours agoparentprevThanks for sharing this. I got a new M2 mac and installed Podman as I didn’t want the Docker Desktop as well. But ran into multiple issues and gave up and have been begrudgingly putting up with Docker Desktop.My main complaints are: * the builds fail randomly * containers don’t stop when I run docker compose stop from CLISo, I have to restart Docker Desktop a couple of times to reset everything. Does running the docker runtime with colima also gets into these issues? reply misnome 1 hour agorootparentI switched to Rancher Desktop which IIRC uses the same engine and haven’t had any compatibility issues with it. reply thanksgiving 3 hours agorootparentprevPlease share this experience and what went wrong with the postman team.

There are people suffering from things like Astigmatism (myself included) who have an extremely hard time, including headaches, using dark themes.

Never connected the two until now.I find it physically unpleasant to look at during daylight hours, in a way I can&#x27;t explain to my coworkers. reply aquariusDue 24 minutes agorootparentAs a counter example I too suffer from astigmatism and I prefer dark themes with high contrast. Sometimes I&#x27;ll pick a theme that doesn&#x27;t exactly vibe color wise just for the high contrast otherwise it&#x27;s hard to focus, both mentally and actually reading what&#x27;s on the screen.I also zoom in most websites, UIs, code editors and the terminal, so take my personal experience as just another point and nothing definitive. reply least 12 hours agorootparentprev> Also, as the OP pointed out, people somehow get angry when all you asked is for an app to follow the system&#x27;s theme. It has been such a huge regression.Was there a time when Podman Desktop supported a light mode? You could change the CSS yourself, which given you only need a light mode, would be pretty trivial.Please keep in mind that dark themes were introduced as an accessibility feature as well, but not every project can or will prioritize it. reply eikenberry 13 hours agoparentprevWelcome to the club. So many things still don&#x27;t support a dark theme either. Why aren&#x27;t dark&#x2F;light modes standard these days?

If you have different needs then go pound sand.

The split between root and rootless is also wrought with forking guides and very confusing to triage. For example, rootless needs more care with capabilities. reply sirsinsalot 9 hours agoparentprevI managed to build and run a Docker compose setup that had been used exclusively with Docker for years without issue.The problem came when trying to get other systems to talk to Podman in place of Docker. It just ... didn&#x27;t work. reply IshKebab 12 hours agoparentprevI used instead of Docker for a while because it came by default on RHEL (I&#x27;m using 8).It has very impressive compatibility with Docker. For 99% of use cases you will not even know you are using Podman. The one case that forced me to uninstall it and use Docker was running `gitlab-runner`&#x27;s integration tests which do some funny things with Vagrant and VMWare, and Podman didn&#x27;t like it. But overall I am very impressed with the compatibility.There aren&#x27;t really any advantages to using it for individual users. Being rootless is a huge upside on the server though. At my previous company I accidentally deleted all the containers running on a server because I naively assumed that Docker followed the normal permission model and would only let me delete my containers. Imagine my surprise when I learned that Docker basically runs as root and all users that have access to Docker have root access!Of course I only made that mistake once, but still... Crazy design. reply heresie-dabord 11 hours agorootparent> There aren&#x27;t really any advantages to using it for individual users.Cheers, but his is not true.Running a container without root privilege is a security advantage for users who run containers that (inevitably) contain vulnerabilities. reply bildiba 11 hours agorootparentEven more so if said containers contain Trojans.Bit more secure than running directly, but if the container is broken out of, attacker directly gets root. reply mmh0000 6 hours agorootparentAdding to the parent&#x27;s point.

But the only thing preventing me from using Podman right now is the fact that Docker has BuildKit, and BuildKit has some really nice features like Secret Mounts, Cache Mounts and SSH Mounts. reply tapoxi 10 hours agoprevI&#x27;ve been using it since I migrated our container builds to buildah (docker-dind is spooky) and I needed something Docker-Desktopy without paying for a license.

It&#x27;s just... it&#x27;s really rough, there are a ton of \"known\" issues, and it&#x27;s rather unreliable. As a result, I&#x27;ve been really trying to push the \"just use the docker daemon in prod instead\" (to no avail... yet). reply ftmch 4 hours agorootparentSwitching to Docker in production would probably reveal some edge cases, if not outright incompatibilities, at some point. reply dboreham 12 hours agorootparentprev> \"just use the docker daemon in prod instead\"Can you expand on what that means? reply drzaiusx11 7 hours agorootparentNot op, but the suggestion is likely to use Podman Desktop during local container development. Then switch to the docker runtime in production systems (ec2 etc.)Podman and Docker Engine are both OCI runtimes. The theory being that containers reproducablly run across different runtimes without changes in behavior. reply Rapzid 12 hours agoparentprevI was under the impression they were sidelining compose in favor of their k8s manifest flavor which.. Well, let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;ve never been in a compose file and thought \"Man, I wish I was writing k8s manifest syntax\". reply dboreham 12 hours agorootparentYou can write a tool that translates between compose format and k8s-babble on-the-fly.When I say you, I mean me.

I think Podman only works with \"docker-compose\" (the Python-based tool that can be installed separately from Docker, which Podman is compatible with, which is now deprecated) as opposed to \"docker compose\" (the Golang-based plugin which is integrated into Docker Engine, which I think Podman is not (yet?) compatible with).Would love to be proven wrong, as I ended up down quite a rabbit hole with this topic somewhat recently. reply pydry 13 hours agorootparentprevHalf of the point of podman was to avoid the need to run things with root.Docker compose expects me to have a server running. While I technically could run \"podman system service\" and configure docker compose to point at a non-standard socket or port in order to run it I would really prefer not to have that kind of headache just to run a script.Docker compose was also written by docker and exhibits similar levels of shoddiness to docker. The accumulation of bad design decisions by docker is, indeed, why podman exists in the first place. With a little bit of love podman compose could easily surpass docker compose. reply timost 11 hours agorootparentI agree with you on the state of podman compose.I just wanted to clarify that you can run docker-compose with podman in _rootless_ mode. This can be done by running podman&#x27;s systemd user service. reply pydry 10 hours agorootparentFWIW I actually tend to run podman compose inside a podman container. This is so I can containerize the integration tests which orchestrate the app. It&#x27;s a useful pattern - one I think should be a lot more widely used for several reasons. The systemd service wouldn&#x27;t work in this context.I could maybe use some entrypoint magic to run a server when the container starts just so I can use docker compose but still...eww.Running a podman systemd service might suffice if it was something that could be installed with a snap of two fingers on every environment but if it means fscking around with service files it&#x27;s definitely not something I&#x27;d want to add to a \"set up a development environment\" README. reply sodality2 8 hours agoparentprevI use podman compose in my SaaS to automate and make deployment easier for docker containers, it works great in my simple docker compose (image, name, port expose, volume. that’s it). I suppose use case matters, and mine is very simple, but i’ll just toss one more N=1 in the ring. reply MuffinFlavored 13 hours agoparentprevWhy not write a Helm chart and deploy it locally with Helm or ArgoCD? reply chucky_z 13 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re being downvoted.

It is functionally similar to Docker Desktop, which is also just a GUI to work with containers. It is a tool for those that prefer working with containers with a GUI instead of the terminal. reply jacurtis 12 hours agorootparent> It is a tool for those that prefer working with containers with a GUI instead of the terminal.Sort of. In the case of podman desktop, that is true because you can opt to just install the cli podman if you prefer.But in the world of Docker, they force end-users on Mac (and I think windows) to install docker through docker desktop even if you don&#x27;t ever touch the GUI. I don&#x27;t use the GUI ever, but can&#x27;t find a way to install docker on Mac outside of the GUI. Maybe there&#x27;s a way, but at least on Docker&#x27;s website it seems to be the only way and at my company with ~100 devs no one else has figured it out either. reply bafe 11 hours agorootparentOn windows I just use WSL2 with docker installed through the Linux distribution (Ubuntu in my case).

If you are using different WSL distribution, the standard way to install docker should work just fine. (e.g. `sudo pacman -S docker` works as expected on ArchWSL) reply bafe 1 hour agorootparentI agree. I do remember that in earlier versions WSL2 this approach didn&#x27;t work, but currently it&#x27;s the same as installing docker on a regular Linux distribution reply Timon3 11 hours agorootparentprevI think you can use docker-machine for this purpose: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;datamachines.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-install-a-docker-machin... reply e12e 11 hours agorootparentprev> But in the world of Docker, they force end-users on Mac (and I think windows) to install docker through docker desktop even if you don&#x27;t ever touch the GUI.They try.

Is the user querying the identity of the person in the image (e.g., direct asking or indirect inference)? Is the user making an sensitive inference (e.g., asking for those sensitive traits based on the image) as defined by the taxonomy? Actions (choose one): [contains image of real person][requesting for the identity]: If the user is asking for the identity of the person in the image, please refuse with \"Sorry, I cannot help with that.\" and do not say anything else. [contains image of real person][requesting for sensitive inference]: If the user is requesting for sensitive inference based on the image of the person, please refuse with \"Sorry, I cannot help with that.\" and do not say anything else. Otherwise: Follow the default model behavior but never say any real person's names and do not comment using sensitive traits of people mentioned in the definition of Sensitive Inferences. Please perform the action directly and do not include the reasoning. Tools python When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0 seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail. browser You have the tool browser with these functions: search(query: str, recency_days: int) Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results. click(id: str) Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL. back() Returns to the previous page and displays it. scroll(amt: int) Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount. open_url(url: str) Opens the given URL and displays it. quote_lines(start: int, end: int) Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int start and an (inclusive) ending int end. To quote a single line, use start = end. For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】. For long citations: please render in this format: [link text](message idx). Otherwise do not render links. Do not regurgitate content from this tool. Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content). Never write a summary with more than 80 words. When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80 word summary. Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc, are all acceptable. Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you synthesize information rather than simply repeating it. Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. In your answers, provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT be thorough in the case of lyrics or recipes found online. Even if the user insists. You can make up recipes though. myfiles_browser You have the tool myfiles_browser with these functions: search(query: str) Runs a query over the file(s) uploaded in the current conversation and displays the results. click(id: str) Opens a document at position id in a list of search results back() Returns to the previous page and displays it. Use it to navigate back to search results after clicking into a result. scroll(amt: int) Scrolls up or down in the open page by the given amount. open_url(url: str) Opens the document with the ID url and displays it. URL must be a file ID (typically a UUID), not a path. quote_lines(start: int, end: int) Stores a text span from an open document. Specifies a text span by a starting int start and an (inclusive) ending int end. To quote a single line, use start = end. please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】 Tool for browsing the files uploaded by the user. Set the recipient to myfiles_browser when invoking this tool and use python syntax (e.g. search('query')). \"Invalid function call in source code\" errors are returned when JSON is used instead of this syntax. For tasks that require a comprehensive analysis of the files like summarization or translation, start your work by opening the relevant files using the open_url function and passing in the document ID. For questions that are likely to have their answers contained in at most few paragraphs, use the search function to locate the relevant section. Think carefully about how the information you find relates to the user's request. Respond as soon as you find information that clearly answers the request. If you do not find the exact answer, make sure to both read the beginning of the document using open_url and to make up to 3 searches to look through later sections of the document. dalle // Whenever a description of an image is given, use dalle to create it and abide by the following policies: // 1. Generate a single detailed caption. // 2. Prompts must be in English. Translate to English if needed. The caption sent to dalle should be a paragraph of text that is extremely descriptive and detailed and at least 2 sentences long. // 3. Do not create more than 2 images, even if the user requests more. // 4. Don't create images of politicians or other public figures. Recommend other ideas instead. // 5. Don't create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo). // - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya) // - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist // 6. Don't ask the user for permission to generate the image, just do it! // 7. Always mention the image type (photo, oil painting, watercolor painting, illustration, cartoon, drawing, vector, render, etc.) at the beginning of the caption. Unless the caption suggests otherwise, mostly generate photos. // 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions. // - EXPLICITLY specify these attributes, not abstractly reference them. The attributes should be specified in a minimal way and should directly describe their physical form. // - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes. // - Use \"various\" or \"diverse\" ONLY IF the description refers to groups of more than 3 people. Do not change the number of people requested in the original description. // - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. // - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive. // - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations. // 9. Silently modify descriptions that include names or hints or references of specific people or celebrities by carefully selecting a few minimal modifications to substitute references to the people with generic descriptions that don't divulge any information about their identities, except for their genders and physiques. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases: // - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. \"Barake Obema\") // - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it. // - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying \"president\", \"prime minister\", or \"chancellor\", say \"politician\"; instead of saying \"king\", \"queen\", \"emperor\", or \"empress\", say \"public figure\"; instead of saying \"Pope\" or \"Dalai Lama\", say \"religious figure\"; and so on. // 10. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses. // The single detailed caption must intricately describe every part of the image in concrete, objective detail. THINK about what the end goal of the description is, and extrapolate that to what would make satisfying images. // All descriptions sent to dalle should be a paragraph of text that is extremely descriptive and detailed. Each should be more than 3 sentences long. namespace dalle { // Create images from a text-only prompt. type text2im = (_: { // The resolution of the requested image, which can be wide, square, or tall. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default unless the prompt suggests a wide image, 1792x1024, or a full-body portrait, in which case 1024x1792 (tall) should be used instead. Always include this parameter in the request. size?: \"1792x1024\"\"1024x1024\"\"1024x1792\", // The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 2 images. n?: number, // default: 2 // The caption to use to generate the image. If the user does not specify it needs to be exact, generate a single caption that is as detailed as possible. If the user requested modifications to a previous image, the caption should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the user suggestions. prompt: string, // If the user references a previous image, this field should be populated with the generation id from the dalle image metadata. referenced_image_ids?: string[], }) => any; } // namespace dalle",

It’s crazy how much this tool has integrated into my workflow in so short of a time. reply stevofolife 18 hours agoparentWhat is your workflow like? reply doctoboggan 17 hours agorootparentI recently switched roles to a \"data engineer\" and had to pick up on many new tools I had no experience with (k8s, helm, Victoria Metrics, grafana, and a few others). In the past I would have spent probably 1+ year using these tools in inefficient or outright incorrect ways while I struggled to get a practitioner&#x27;s understanding of how everything works.Now I&#x27;ve developed a prompt that I think gives very good results for pair programming and iterative debugging. I discus almost everything I learn related to these tools with gpt4 to confirm my understanding is correct, and also use it for generating yaml or templating other programs.In some ways I am a little weary of how much I use the tool since OpenAI can theoretically take it away at any time. I am heartened by the rapid development of other open models (phind code llama seems very interesting), but will continue to use GPT4 for now as its indisputably the best model out there. reply jsight 16 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m having a similar experience. Talking to ChatGPT is like talking to a slightly crazy person that has read every book and every github repo.Sure, occasionally they hypothesize a really incorrect answer, but they also bring out a lot of subtleties that even field experts sometimes don&#x27;t know.It is a huge help while learning. reply Isthatablackgsd 15 hours agorootparentSame for me. I was amazed by the ability of ChatGPT. My first experience of ChatGPT was an assistance with the cover letter for the position and it gave me few paragraph that I modified to my own. It was nice to have a feedback from it that I can ask about the tone of my letter and response, it provided valuable information for me to improve my writing.Now I use ChatGPT for scripting help especially LaTeX. It took me 3 weeks to produce a \"Hello World\" PDF 5 years ago and it took ChatGPT to provide me the completed tex code within 15 minutes few weeks ago. Ever since, I been exploring a lot of LaTeX syntax and see how much I can do with it with ChatGPT help. Now, I am learning about using `hyperref` package for interactive fields in PDF. I have produced few Word document for forms with tables in the past (tables in Word is a complicated b*tch) and used external PDF editor to add the interactive field for form filling. Now I am working on converting those Word documents to LaTeX.Also, ChatGPT is a big help with AutoHotKey script & UserScript for TamperMonkey. I told ChatGPT of my intention and what I am trying to do. It produced the script exactly what I expected to work. ChatGPT is a amazing tools to use for a lot of thing. reply Tomte 14 hours agorootparent> Also, ChatGPT is a big help with AutoHotKey scriptI&#x27;ve tried that extensively, with no luck.I have some experience with AHK1 and wanted ChatGPT to basically convert scripts to AHK2.It&#x27;s pretty much a loop: first response gives a syntax error. When I reply with the error message, it apologizes, explains where the error is, and gives another solution. That solution has different errors. When pasting the error message, it apologizes again, and gives a third version with syntax errors. And then it starts with the first version again, and I can repeat the loop. reply the_omegist 1 hour agorootparentYeah, I had the exact same experience.I am surprised how bad it is with ahk scripts and wonder why. What is indeed \"original\" is that it gives code with unexisting functions, which it never does for the other languages (in my experience).Perhaps the language is not that famous compared to js or C but i doubt. There are tons of forums discussing issues... Strange. reply Isthatablackgsd 10 hours agorootparentprevYea that can happen. I found the best way to do it is baby steps. I asked it to do point a then it will create a simple small script. Then I follow up with how I do point a to point b, then it will start to add or revise the code a bit. Then I do point c and keep adding it. It is better to break down the process and provide it in chucks of what you want it to do, it fare better to provide you something.If it start to get off the rail, I copy the code and close the chat. Then I create a new chat and tell it to use this code as a strict reference. And I tell it what I am trying to do, then it starts to improve the code further.I found that it is best to give it my snippet of code and it will be able to use it as a template and modify it from there.For your case, if you want to convert it from ahk1 to ahk2, give it a small section of the script. And it should be able to convert it from there. If that didn&#x27;t work, then you could start from fresh and tell it of what you want in ahk2 script. reply fragmede 14 hours agorootparentprevSame. I think it&#x27;s due to a lack of example code on the web for it. There&#x27;s some, but nowhere near eg Python. reply anjanb 14 hours agorootparentprevcan you share videos of how you do prompts to get AutoHotkey scripts and TamperMonkey scrips ? reply gzer0 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you don&#x27;t mind sharing, what prompt do you use? And that is incredible to hear, GPT has done similar magnitudes of change in my own workflow. reply doctoboggan 16 hours agorootparentHere is my prompt:You are an expert programmers assistant, specializing in cloud native deployment tools like Kubernetes, helm, and their associated command line tools. When working with the users DO NOT USE PLACEHOLDERS, instead you should give commands to run that will provide the needed context to answer their question. For example, rather than answer with `k logs `, you would first instruct the user to run `k get pods`, wait for the user to respond with the pod names, then you would give the full `k logs` command with the correct pod name already included in it. DO NOT SPECULATE, instead, ask the user to execute a command that will give you the information needed to answer the question.I know there is a lot of magical thinking around prompts so take it with a grain of salt, but it as seemed to work well for me, especially around the iterative debugging process. reply orzig 16 hours agorootparentThank you for sharing your prompt! I hear people talking about how much ChatGPT has changed their life and I sometimes feel like I am accidentally using an entirely different product – it’s definitely worth $20 a month but I find myself disappointed more than half the time that I reach for it. I will try some of the ideas from your prompt for my work context.Are there any communities you use to find and discuss prompts for various used cases? reply AussieWog93 14 hours agorootparentI&#x27;d compare GPT-4 to having a mid-level SWE (3-5 years experience) as a consultant.If you&#x27;re just getting started with a new technology, it&#x27;s fantastic. But if you&#x27;re already familiar with your stack, you&#x27;ll probably produce better code on your own. reply kridsdale3 13 hours agorootparentI feel the same way. It&#x27;s a dedicated intern sitting at my desk with me, who can read documentation instantly, that&#x27;s worth $150,000. And for $240&#x2F;year. reply bsenftner 14 hours agorootparentprevThe API is pure usage based. I&#x27;m using the API in an an app I&#x27;m developing, both as one of the UI means for the user to do things as well as in the backend.

The biggest problem I&#x27;ve seen is that it doesn&#x27;t always get the Unity 2022 docs right, but I&#x27;m hoping the training cutoff being moved from 2021 to 2023 addresses that. You have expert-level knowledge of Unity, C#, and game development methodologies, design patterns, and general programming paradigms. Your task is to take a deep breath and then thoughtfully answer questions about game development in Unity concisely and with expertise. Whenever possible, explain why you&#x27;ve given the answer you chose using terminology and jargon that would be familiar to the typical game developer. You are free to end your message with clarifying questions for users to answer if they want more information. Refuse to answer any questions that aren&#x27;t about games, game development, game design, or artificial intelligence.

I&#x27;m sure a lot of us would like to learn how to learn better! reply FranklinMaillot 13 hours agorootparentA few tricks that work for me when learning a new topic with chatGPT. I start by asking an overview of the subject, like a course syllabus, before diving in.When learning a new programming language, I found it useful to tell what programming language I&#x27;m already familiar with, and ask it to relate and compare to what I already know.When I need advice on how to achieve a certain result, I usually ask it to suggest several options and to list them with their pros and cons.Another trick that I stole from Jeremy Howard, is to use the custom instructions to easily signal the type of answer you want. For example, I&#x27;ve instructed chatGPT to give a concise answer with no explanation when I prefix my question with &#x27;-sh&#x27;. reply pineaux 18 hours agorootparentprevI am also curious... reply devinprater 16 hours agoprevNope, don&#x27;t have it yet. Would be really cool to plop in a PDF that&#x27;s made up of just images, and tell it to describe each page of the PDF to me. As a blind person, that&#x27;d just... Be a dream come true. reply cco 3 hours agoparentYou can directly upload images, both on the web and mobile. It works really well.In fact I&#x27;ve used both images and voice to describe things and it works like a charm. You should already have that if you pay for plus. reply igemal 7 hours agoparentprevRight now I&#x27;m working on a fork of a little web app that parses a resume and spits it into JSON format with GPT (I&#x27;m working on stuff like OCR for a scanned pdf). https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IsaacGemal&#x2F;nlp-resume-parser I feel like it wouldn&#x27;t be that difficult to fork it again, but rewrite the main function so it sends the pdf to some sort of GPT-Vision, and write the output again with a regular GPT api call. Does such a tool not exist? Or maybe I have to wait for image support via the API. reply spdustin 12 hours agoparentprevSadly, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;ll work.

Does that 8K limit, limit your context length, i.e. history you have per chat thread with the tool? reply dragonwriter 15 hours agorootparent> Does that 8K limit, limit your context length, i.e. history you have per chat thread with the tool?Yes, the token limit for an LLM limits the combination of the prompt (which normally includes the whole conversation history, as the LLM itself has no memory) and response.There&#x27;s tricks to have a longer conversation without completely forgetting the past (summarization, offloading parts to a database, usually indexed by embedding vectors, and using search to recall relevant history, etc.) but the base case is everything has to fit into context. reply nomel 16 hours agoprevI&#x27;m curious to see how this works, in practice. I notice poorer performance just with plugins enabled. Making the context hyper specific seems to be the best way to get it to perform (understandably), and this is a large, fairly diverse, prompt.> and do not say anything else.Is a bit frustrating. I assume the ambiguity here will really harm the conversation, if a refusal is hit.

If so, burning up tokens like this is interesting. I would naively assume this could be be handled in Dalle, but maybe there&#x27;s a performance gain if ChatGPT is made aware of the Dalle prompt? reply spdustin 12 hours agoparentThe reason I track all those system prompts is due to the way they affect attention when using custom instructions. Having a system message that&#x27;s already 2,700+ tokens before adding custom instructions is a tough hill to climb. reply bugglebeetle 16 hours agoparentprevThe data analysis plug-in falls over for even basic CSV file parsing. I tried it a couple times and it was a nonstop cavalcade of “sorry, I had an error.” It’s far easier to get it to write the Python, R, etc code for whatever analysis task you want accomplished. reply simonw 15 hours agorootparentInteresting - my experience has been the opposite of that, I&#x27;ve found that ChatGPT Code Interpreter &#x2F; Advanced Data Analysis is wildly effective at parsing anything I give it. Not just CSV either - I&#x27;ve uploaded random binary files and told it to figure out what they are and it often gets there after churning through a few iterations. reply bugglebeetle 15 hours agorootparentMy experience was trying to get it to generate some charts from some fairly basic CSV inputs. It failed numerous times and would change the chart formatting when it was asked for a revision (e.g. from horizontal to vertical), even though that was not what was being requested. I hate doing matplotlib stuff, so I was hoping this could be more automated, but prompting it to create and tweak the corresponding code to do this seems to be far more efficient. It did seem to do OK when prompted with both the CSV file and some code for chart creation, but that kind of defeats the purpose of the plug-in, IMO. reply emptysongglass 13 hours agorootparentprevNot being able to fetch packages from PyPi is not great either.

It runs on the same FPGA hardware, but has unrelated CPU architecture? reply hajile 5 hours agorootparentCPU is just one part. You&#x27;re probably adding your own coprocessor and whatever other IO to the FPGA. If the CPU uses a different interconnect&#x2F;protocol design, you&#x27;ll have to redesign and debug your entire interface which will be very expensive.Meanwhile, microblaze is a proprietary architecture. AMD puts a few hundred thousand dollars of dev time into it here or there, but most software stacks will have tons of stuff not at all designed for that ISA. If you can switch to RISC-V, you get access to an ecosystem where tons of companies are all pouring multi-millions in every year.EDIT: a great example is that microBlaze was added to LLVM in 2010, but then removed in 2013 because nobody was free to maintain it.Now AMD comes along and says you can swap out the CPU ISA to RISC-V without needing any hardware redesigns and then with a simple recompile, you can start using that massive ecosystem instead of spending man-years writing your own stuff which saves your company lots of money. reply brucehoult 6 hours agorootparentprevIt has the same interface to the rest of the design -- the buses and control signals etc. You can drop the new RISC-V soft core straight into an existing design using Microblaze and change only the program code. reply namibj 7 hours agorootparentprevI assume it means it&#x27;s essentially pin-compatible, like, say, a PCIe GPU upgrade would be.

I think \"hardware compatible\" means that it runs on the same FPGAs as microblaze arm with the same toolchain product suite. reply addaon 6 hours agorootparent\"Pins\", in this case, means the logical ports used to interface one module within an FPGA to another. Think AMBA bus, clock(s), interrupt lines, etc. An FPGA SOC design that currently throws a bunch of different IPs (modules) together to do... something... could do the same with this core thrown in to replace a (classic) Microblaze with only a resynthesis on the hardware side, and a recompile on the software side. reply FastFT 6 hours agorootparentprevHardware compatible doesn’t mean very much in this case. It’s a different ISA so you’ll need a different tool chain and recompilation (possibly rewrite given that assembly is very common in deeply embedded processors). It’ll also have different LUT usage, etc. reply tails4e 1 hour agorootparentIt means it&#x27;s designed as a direct drop in replacent for a traditional microblaze ISA code..sure software must be recompiled, but hardware interfaces match what was there before for peripheral access, debug, instruction offload, etc. This makes the transition to using RISC-v much more seamless if you were already using microblaze reply snvzz 5 hours agoparentprevIt is the same interface facing your HDL. Whereas on the software side, it is RISC-V, the ISA that&#x27;s rapidly growing the strongest ecosystem.Just a recompile away, except this time, you don&#x27;t have to deal with poor, proprietary, bespoke, low quality tooling, but you can instead use reputable industry standard tools like gcc, binutils, llvm. reply opello 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m pretty sure the \"bespoke\" tooling was just older versions of those industry standard tools because of poor upstreaming of architecture support. And there are probably many, very reasonable, justifications for that having been the case... the least of which is shipping toolchains with their own design tools.RISC-V doesn&#x27;t seem like the \"strongest\" ISA ecosystem, unless you mean among soft core CPUs? reply snvzz 1 hour agorootparent>unless you mean among soft core CPUsNote that RISC-V hard cores in FPGAs are already a reality, including Microsemi PolarFire as well as GOWIN GW2N.Not long from now, I expect every FPGA vendor to switch over.

DAN GOODIN - 11/2/2023, 5:41 PM Enlarge Getty Images 24 WITH Identity and authentication management provider Okta has been hit by another breach, this one against a third-party vendor that allowed hackers to steal personal information for 5,000 Okta employees. The compromise was carried out in late September against Rightway Healthcare, a service Okta uses to support employees and their dependents in finding health care providers and plan rates. An unidentified threat actor gained access to Rightway’s network and made off with an eligibility census file the vendor maintained on behalf of Okta. Okta learned of the compromise and data theft on October 12 and didn’t disclose it until Thursday, exactly three weeks later.

You can unsubscribe at any time. “The types of personal information contained in the impacted eligibility census file included your Name, Social Security Number, and health or medical insurance plan number,” a letter sent to affected Okta employees stated. “We have no evidence to suggest that your personal information has been misused against you.” The letter, which is the first time the event has been disclosed, said that Okta opened an investigation immediately after learning of it. The investigation revealed that data for 4,961 Okta employees was included in the stolen file. In an email, an Okta representative said that based on information Rightway provided, the intruder first gained access to a Rightway employee’s cell phone and then used that access to change credentials and take the files. The files, which were from April 2019 through 2020, were exfiltrated from Rightway’s IT environment. The personal information pertained to Okta employees and their dependents from 2019 and 2020. Okta also said that Rightway informed it that the compromise involved multiple Rightway customers. Advertisement “This incident does not relate to the use of Okta services and Okta services remain secure,” the representative said. “No Okta customer data is impacted by this incident.” Rightway representatives didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment and additional details about the breach. FURTHER READING Okta says hackers breached its support system and viewed customer files Thursday’s disclosure comes two weeks after Okta revealed that hackers compromised its customer support system and obtained credentials that allowed them to take control of customers’ internal Okta administration accounts. The attackers then used those credentials in follow-on hacks that targeted the internal administration accounts of 1Password, BeyondTrust, Cloudflare, and possibly other customers. Okta is based in San Francisco and provides cloud identity, access management for single sign-on, multifactor authentication, and API services to thousands of organizations worldwide. The company has previously come under criticism for security breaches and its handling of them afterward. Most recently, Cloudflare called out Okta for not driving the intruders out of its network until October 18, 16 days after first learning of the compromise. Cloudflare urged Okta to act quicker in the future when learning of security breaches, providing disclosures sooner and requiring the use of hardware keys to protect internal systems and systems used by third-party support providers. “For a critical security service provider like Okta, we believe following these best practices is table stakes,” Cloudflare researchers wrote. The Okta representative said in Thursday’s email that when the company learned of the Rightway compromise on October 12, investigators had 27,000 records to sort through. Much of the process had to be manually done and took time to complete.

A third-party Vendor Okta used for health insurance information was breached, and personal information on Okta employees was stolen.I&#x27;m disappointed in Ars Technica, and Dan Goodin.edit: Updated to be more specific about what part of Okta this had nothing to do with. reply coldcode 15 hours agoparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rightwayhealthcare.com is the company mentioned in the article. Okta is shown as a customer on the website, and the company&#x27;s marketing says \"Our members love using Rightway\". There is zero mention of security on their website that I see, but the website is entirely marketing and self-congratulatory. I would expect that other Rightway customers were likely also affected, but they had no comment mentioned in this article so how wide the breach was is unknown. Okta is a well-known company so that&#x27;s why this article focused on them, which is not the real story, but I guess like you said clickbait. reply coldcode 15 hours agorootparentOkta is promoting Rightway as a benefit of Okta: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rewards.okta.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;healthcare&#x2F;medical&#x2F;rightway-heal... reply chriscjcj 5 hours agoparentprevARS commenters seem to have created a very specific kind of echo chamber and they guard it passionately, fiercely rebuking any and all dissenting opinions into oblivion. Sadly, ARS writers seem motivated to cater these folks&#x27; predilections. Sometimes it seems like they write articles with little purpose other than to provide grist for their beloved mob&#x27;s mill. Perhaps these journalists are rewarded for &#x27;high audience engagement.&#x27;So glad HN hasn&#x27;t devolved into that. Gratitude to the mods here. reply ta1243 15 hours agoparentprevOkta (or any company) can&#x27;t outsource its responsibility when it outsources to a supplier.If Okta printed all that personal data and left it in a box on the street they would be liable. reply ryanisnan 15 hours agorootparentOk, but that&#x27;s not what the article says. It says Okta was breached. Okta was not breached. reply arrakeenrevived 15 hours agorootparentIt says Okta was \"hit by\" a breach, which it was. A breach happened, and Okta was impacted. Furthermore, it happened to data which Okta is ultimately responsible for, and Okta should be held responsible for their choices which led to their employees&#x27; data being stolen.I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;re splitting hairs on this. reply d3w4s9 14 hours agorootparentBecause context and sentiment matters. By your logic clickbait is perfectly fine and we should maybe do more because they are (usually) technically correct. reply BeefWellington 7 hours agorootparentJust continue reading the title all the way to the end? I know it&#x27;s a long haul but come on, we can&#x27;t just stop at the first bit of punctuation:> Okta hit by another breach, this one stealing employee data from 3rd-party vendorIt&#x27;s clear a breach has affected Okta employees. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentprev\"another\" is the weasel wordIt implies this breach is the same as the previous breach, which it&#x27;s not.Ars has gone to shit over the last decade. reply arrakeenrevived 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think I agree that the use of the word \"another\" implies that the breaches were equal, but I can see why others might interpret it that way.I won&#x27;t disagree with opinion on the quality of Ars&#x27; reporting or this particular article, but I do disagree with the original comment&#x27;s statement that \"this had nothing to do with Okta\". reply d3w4s9 14 hours agorootparentWithout knowing the context, I doubt anyone reading the title is thinking \"maybe they mean another breach where Okta is impacted but Okta is not the culprit, despite recent events\". No, the title is simply misleading. They could have swapped Okta for another company&#x27;s name or something like \"Personal information stolen in healthcare company breach\", and the news likely wouldn&#x27;t get much attention, which is as much as what the article is actually worth. Singling out Okta among many of that company&#x27;s clients is simply meaningless and wrong and does nothing other than attention grabbing. reply 3c6bYDXLMj 11 hours agorootparentImmediately what I thought when I read it.The person you’re responding to is being obtuse to the point where it feels like trolling or contrarianism for the sake of contrarianism. Certainly a bad-faith argument. reply ryanisnan 15 hours agorootparentprev> but I do disagree with the original comment&#x27;s statement that \"this had nothing to do with Okta\".I could have probably phrased this as \"this had nothing to do with Okta&#x27;s technology.\" reply croes 10 hours agorootparentprevIt says Onta was hit by a breach, Okta was hit ny a breach, it even says that is was a third party vendor. That&#x27;s exactly what happened. reply junon 2 minutes agorootparentThe problem is the article is farming clicks by piggie backing off of the very recent and public breach Okta had. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a term for this, but it&#x27;s clear to me they&#x27;re abusing oktas name. urda 11 hours agoparentprevHonestly Ars has really fallen in the past few years. reply api 15 hours agoparentprevMaybe someone is short selling. reply lofatdairy 12 hours agorootparentThe concept of journalists trading on the news they break is coincidentally making waves right now with this new startup called Hunterbrook[^1]. I assume that outright misleading headlines won&#x27;t be something they&#x27;d risk, but it&#x27;s an interesting concept, since, yeah normally this is something you&#x27;d accuse someone of, and not expect that to be the whole point.[^1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ft.com&#x2F;content&#x2F;3c861c6c-87be-459d-b62f-b44bf2d75... reply OJFord 13 hours agorootparentprevSomeone(s) almost certainly (are), not necessarily relatedly (to the article, to the breaches, yeah absolutely), what a pointlessly vague thing to say. reply eli 14 hours agorootparentprevThe truth is usually less exciting. reply Terretta 14 hours agoprevConnecting a few dots why, while the headline seems misleading, it might matter.1. Okta employee PII and foreign key to employee health info (a particularly sensitive class of PII) may be exposed.“On October 12, 2023, Rightway informed Okta that an unauthorized actor gained access to an eligibility census file maintained by Rightway in its provision of services ...”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;24110001-okta-indivi...The file contained the following information on current and former Okta employees and their dependents:- Full names- Social Security Numbers (SSNs)- Health or Medical Insurance plan number2. Okta and its customer pool are known to be under an aggressive series of phishing and social engineering attacks.3. This type of information makes those attacks more effective.So while this particular breach starts as a Rightway problem, the nature of what was taken puts Okta itself at additional risk, as attackers build their social engineering &#x2F; phishing dossier while looking for ways to get into Okta and&#x2F;or get to Okta&#x27;s customers in bulk. reply ryanisnan 11 hours agoparentThanks for this. Posts like this are why I like Hacker News. This is a valid problem for Okta, and I think accurately frames the problem.Real-talk, if you were calling the shots at Okta, what would you do here?Enforce hardware-key MFA everywhere, for every vendor service? Impose a no-professional-social-media policy for all employees? This probably is too late to do any good, but it&#x27;s pretty clear phishing is a hot vector right now. reply bee_rider 15 hours agoprev> “The types of personal information contained in the impacted eligibility census file included your Name, Social Security Number, and health or medical insurance plan number,” a letter sent to affected Okta employees stated. “We have no evidence to suggest that your personal information has been misused against you.”That seems like a pretty ridiculous statement. Is it supposed to be reassuring or something? Like, obviously Okta has no way of knowing whether or not their employees PII, having been leaked, will be exploited, and when it does get exploited, it almost certainly will be the employees who find out about it, not Okta. reply constantly 15 hours agoparentSounds like the statement is referencing the past not the future. I think it’s a reasonable thing for them to say: this was stolen, and that sucks, but perhaps a little reassuringly we haven’t detected this being misused. idk. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentTo the extent that it is reassuring, it is misleading, right? Unless they have some way of being reasonably sure that the fact that they haven’t detected misuse implies that it hasn’t happened. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentI think there&#x27;s probably a legal reason that&#x27;s included, as it&#x27;s in all info leak announcements I&#x27;ve seen. reply bee_rider 14 hours agorootparentIt seems like the most reassuring&#x2F;misleading thing that can be said without technically lying. reply ethbr1 13 hours agorootparentOr there&#x27;s a legal responsibility to disclose if you know anything? So everyone has to explicitly say they don&#x27;t?IANAL, so not sure.That it&#x27;s always included and worded exactly the same makes me suspect legal instead of PR. replyAaronstotle 16 hours agoprevNot really Okta&#x27;s fault here, just so happened that Okta was a client of this benefits company. Still, not a good look for Okta. reply handsclean 15 hours agoparentThere are two types of people, people who take responsibility for things that aren’t directly their fault, and people who regularly experience negative outcomes.Okta chose this vendor and they chose to have them store this data. They probably even have security requirements in their contract with them. They could have prevented this. And when you present yourself as a security company, you’re expected to. reply cheschire 14 hours agorootparentThere are two types of people, those who express everything in dichotomies, and those who don&#x27;t, and those who start indexing at zero. reply yakubin 7 hours agorootparentPeople who start indexing at 0 still say that {0, 1, 2} has 3 elements, not 2. ;) reply jlarocco 16 hours agoparentprevDoes that matter, though? The message I get is that Okta isn&#x27;t good with security, and they&#x27;re not good at choosing vendors who are good with security. reply clintonb 16 hours agorootparentYes, context matters. If you discount every company that might be impacted by a third-party breach of employee data, you will be left with no vendors. At some point you have to decide what is acceptable, and have insurance&#x2F;indemnity for the risks.I would not discount Okta because of a decision made by HR. reply JamesLeonis 15 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m discounting a security company with several recent high-profile security incidents. As somebody that implemented Okta for a bank, for both customers and internal personnel, I am very concerned.EDIT: Before you defend Okta, tell me why it took three weeks for them to disclose this breach to their own employees? If they&#x27;re dragging their feet for their own employees, and given Cloudflare&#x27;s recent experience, why should I trust Okta at all?> Okta learned of the compromise and data theft on October 12 and didn’t disclose it until Thursday, exactly three weeks later. reply arrakeenrevived 15 hours agorootparentprevI would.A critical part of having a robust security program is having an effective third party risk management program which evaluates all third parties that you do business with and holds them to high security standards. Okta is the ultimate party that is responsible for protecting this data, and that still remains true even if they subcontract out the protection of that data. If you aren&#x27;t doing third party risk management, then it calls into question what other critical parts of security you&#x27;re failing at.For a company like Okta, which supposedly is a \"security\" company, to have _repeated_ security failings like this should make everyone question them. reply bink 16 hours agorootparentprevMost large companies vet their vendors to some extent. It&#x27;s hard to know if that happened in this case or not, but it&#x27;s still part of the normal procurement process to perform a security review. These reviews have varying levels of security requirements depending on what type of PII will be stored or processed. Considering this breach included SSN&#x27;s I&#x27;d have expected this to be one of the more thorough reviews. reply jerf 15 hours agorootparentThose \"assessments\" amount to sending over a document that says 1. Are you secure? 2. Are you secure? 3. Are you secure? 4. Are you secure? ... 37. Are you secure?and the company sends back 1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. Yes, definitely. 4. Oh yes. ... 37. Yes.There&#x27;s a lot more words, but not necessarily a lot more value in those words then what I have here. Some, I admit, but not necessarily a lot.Maybe at the high government end a real assessment is done where the experts of the client&#x27;s choosing go into the provider&#x27;s actual environment and makes a real assessment. But from what I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s self-reporting the vast majority of the time, and the provider could honestly believe they&#x27;re running a tight ship and not realize there&#x27;s one setting in one AWS account that&#x27;s just a bit too open and oh no my database. (Or perhaps rather \"oh no your database\".) reply kccqzy 13 hours agorootparentI think you haven&#x27;t seen enough. Self assessment is a great start. I&#x27;ve seen companies demanding their vendors to go through pentesting from several different pentesting companies, and then addressing all high-severity issues to the satisfaction of the pentesting company before officially allowed as a vendor.Naturally you still have to trust the pentesting company to do a good job but it&#x27;s better than just a self assessment. reply bink 14 hours agorootparentprevSelf-assessments are definitely an option some companies use, but there is a middle ground between a full assessment conducted by the customer and a self-assessment. ISO, SOC2, etc. all provide what I would consider to be better than a simple self-assessment as they require a third-party audit. They aren&#x27;t anywhere close to perfect but they are significantly better than a self-assessment IMHO. There are no guarantees, of course. reply ethbr1 15 hours agorootparentprevAnother way of looking at it is that if a company doesn&#x27;t truth you to answer truthfully, why are they choosing you as a vendor?Presumably you&#x27;d be lying about the thing they&#x27;d be buying too, or innumerable other things.And &#x27;subsequent lawsuit&#x27; is usually a powerful motivator to be honest. reply jerf 14 hours agorootparentThe next layer of cynicism down is more complicated. I&#x27;m going to make this up to protect the guiltocent, but I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of security assessments that ask the moral equivalent of \"Do you salt the MD5 hashes you use to store password hashes?\" and we end saying Yes in some large number of words because we use bcrypt&#x2F;scrypt properly, or some industry SSO, or our systems communicate with an internal CA TLS authority where \"passwords\" aren&#x27;t even in sight, or whatever other solution leaves salted MD5 in the dust.It&#x27;s literally a deal breaker to send back No, so there&#x27;s a lot of incentive to do what it takes to send a Yes back.And \"subsequent lawsuit\" is a very distant threat in this case.Less cynically, there are some standards that do have some non-zero teeth in them. Some audits are challenging and at least rate \"a good exercise\". But that&#x27;s what I mean by even if the vender truly believes they are compliant with ISO-Thirty-Three-Million-And-Two-Subrevision-A24, they&#x27;re just one error away from ohnoyourdatabase anyhow.The net-net of it all is that, as I sort of alluded to, are these assessments worthless? I mean, no, not quite literally zero. If you send one of these documents to a startup of two dudes and a cat and they claim ISO-Thirty-Three-Million-And-Two-Subrevision-A24 compliance, they&#x27;re lying and the person examining their assessment at least has a chance to be suspicious about it. But in real terms, are they going to be the difference? Unlikely.Or, let me put this another way. I would bet substantial money Okta has in their possession a response to their questionnaire from Rightway Healthcare in which Rightway Healthcare sings the praises of their immense, extraordinary, back-breaking, industry-leading security efforts, complete with citation of the relevant industry standards they comply with, and that it looks as good as anyone else&#x27;s answers.Yet, here we are. reply 3c6bYDXLMj 11 hours agorootparentYeah. This is what always trips engineer-types up when dealing with legal. A contract isn’t code. There is usually, on both sides, a certain degree of BSing that goes on. Put another way, both parties are usually knowingly taking on risk associated with non-compliance. “We meet the security requirements in spirit only” is easily one of the more tame instances of this. reply ethbr1 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not that clear cut.A contract is a probabilistic promise.According to the writer&#x27;s understanding of the law (and the risk tolerance they have for being caught) these are the terms they&#x27;re putting to paper.Generally, that means the writer&#x27;s legal team feels confident that if everything goes sideways and they&#x27;re standing in a courtroom, they have the best possible chance at winning the case with the language they used.Now everyone around legal (e.g. sales, marketing, product, etc.) likely has different incentives. But the entire reason legal is somewhat firewalled is because they&#x27;re the ones thinking about that future courtroom.So it&#x27;s less \"there&#x27;s a certain degree of BSing\" and more that sometimes sales gets their preferred language and sometimes legal wins.And of course, sometimes neither of them know relevant technical details and both their proposals are jibberish. replymagicalhippo 13 hours agorootparentprevOkta isn&#x27;t just any random company though. Employee data can be used for targeted attacks, and Okta is a significantly more interesting target than most other companies.As such I would expect a company like Okta to take much more care about which 3rd party solutions they use. reply dr_faustus 15 hours agoprevI don’t know why people are all pretending like this is irrelevant to Okta&#x27;s security.An employee list like that is a goldmine for all sorts of social engineering and phishing attacks. reply nakon 15 hours agoparentIt’s not that it isn’t relevant, it’s the clickbait-y headline and insinuation that Okta itself was compromised again. Any major company using third-party vendors would be in the same position (and for all we know, this healthcare company provided services to multiple other companies). Fault Okta for not doing enough vendor due diligence, sure, but don’t use clickbait to imply Okta itself was breached. reply dr_faustus 15 hours agorootparentBe it as it may, it does not really matter, whether it came from a Okta database or of any other company. It further compromises Okta&#x27;s security which is pretty bad because being secure is basically their primary service proposition. reply BeefWellington 7 hours agorootparentprevFirstly, the title literally does what you&#x27;re asking:> Okta hit by another breach, this one stealing employee data from 3rd-party vendorYou have to read the whole thing.Secondly, let&#x27;s assume you were right and the title was simple \"Okta hit by another breach\" and there were no other words.Do you not view it as problematic that the company has in two months had a major compromise of its own services via phishing, as well as that of a company supplying health-related services to its own employees? Do you not view that as potentially hazardous and concerning?They chose this company. Effectively, they vetted this company and believed them to be doing things in a way that was secure for their employees. If that vetting process is terrible, then it speaks to how organization-wide the issues there are. reply ryanisnan 15 hours agorootparentprevThe real takeaway for Okta in 2023, if they didn&#x27;t know it already, is they are dealing with nation state threat actors, and if they think they are over-investing in security, they probably aren&#x27;t. reply graypegg 16 hours agoprevIf this is directly related to negligence at Okta or not (which seems like it’s not in this case) doesn’t really matter when “Okta” and “Data Breach” seem to show up close together in headlines a lot.Rough task for people tasked with holding together the “brand” reply libraryatnight 15 hours agoparentIt&#x27;d be more forgivable if they weren&#x27;t so bad at listening to their customers when they report things, technical or security related.The best thing Okta has going for them right now is that a lot of these companies are so bloated and slow that changing platforms takes a long time to pull off even the initial agreement that they&#x27;ll be changing, so they have plenty of time to let things settle even if you&#x27;re mad at them because switching everything to a new idp is \"just not something the business can prioritize right now\"They probably look like hot garbage to customers shopping around but I&#x27;d venture with most existing clients over a certain size they&#x27;ll just ask them for a statement they can email out then the Okta sales guys will treat a few directors to happy hour and a ball game, delaying the long process of being dumped from even starting. reply agilob 16 hours agoprevAgain?

They are trying to say that nothing bad happened, but their SSN and information was stolen!! The information is going to be sold and at a later date it could be used. But they&#x27;re not saying that, they&#x27;re trying to say \"Nothing to see here, your information wasn&#x27;t misused so don&#x27;t worry!\" I would never trust them after giving this statement. reply SoftTalker 16 hours agoparentThe bigger question for me is, \"why is my SSN still such a valuable bit of information\"We, the IT industry, have demonstrated repeatedly that we are not smart enough and&#x2F;or not diligent enough to consistently protect this information. I think we should admit that and try the reverse approach: make knowledge of our PII worthless for committing fraud and theft. We need to fundamentally shift our methods of proving identity to something that doesn&#x27;t rely on keeping a 9-digit number a secret. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentThat’s a bigger questions, and it is a good one, but practically it is not really relevant (other than, I guess, Okta’s vendor has made a small contribution to making it obvious how ill suited these numbers are for authentication). reply ls612 15 hours agorootparentprevBecause the US has a political aversion to centralized IDs at the federal level, but an identity provider of some sort is necessary for lots of business interactions. reply purpleblue 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is the dangers of a too-powerful bureaucracy.It&#x27;s obvious that having the SSN as a single point of failure is exceedingly stupid, but our government bureaucrats refuse to do anything about it. You can&#x27;t even request a new SSN, it&#x27;s practically impossible to get a new one even if your identity is stolen.The only thing holding us back is red tape, which is the dumbest reason of all. reply vharuck 15 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s the danger of using something as a universal password (terrible practice #1) that&#x27;s often stored in plain text (terrible practice #2).I don&#x27;t regularly deal much with federal government agencies beyond the IRS. Which ones let you do nefarious things if you only know a person&#x27;s name, address, and SSN? The IRS doesn&#x27;t, because they require you to know info from what you filed last year. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentprevIt probably seemed a lot more reasonable back when most people’s exposure to “password” was “the thing you needed to get into the speakeasy.” reply mbwgh 15 hours agoparentprevBut this kind of statement is the unfortunate industry standard. A more honest thing to say would be to say \"there is no way to prove that your personal information has been or may yet be misused against you, and as such you should take the following steps to minimize risks [...]\".But compare how that looks compared against the bigger players which can afford to treat their weekly apocalyptic security incidents like it&#x27;s just a bad weather phenomenon we just have to accept, apply a patch for and move on. reply vineyardmike 16 hours agoparentprevNot to discount your point- you’re right it’s so disingenuous.BUT we’re quickly approaching a world where every American has been in a leak that affects their data and SSN. Not 100% of course (simply because young people haven’t had a chance to be screwed over) but at some point we should assume that the information is public for a large enough portion of the population and we need to set new expectations. reply deathanatos 15 hours agorootparent> we’re quickly approaching a world where every American has been in a leak that affects their data and SSN. Not 100% of course (simply because young people haven’t had a chance to be screwed over)… that number, presently, has to be a rounding error from being 100%. My SSN was first breached when I was in high school, at least.But yeah, I agree, we should set new expectations. There could definitely be a better system, and I would like to see companies held to account, but material fines against corps are basically unicorns in America. reply bee_rider 15 hours agorootparentWe need a bunch of case law indicating that banks and credit card companies that don’t authenticate past this widely leaked PII are on the hook for the loss of money (rather than the uninvolved third parties who are being impersonated). reply vineyardmike 12 hours agorootparentThis is already the case. You have to prove you weren’t involved (a quick police report will do), but you’re expected to be made right already. Banks have just deemed this current level of fraud acceptable.Currently, if Mallory finds Alice’s SSN and opens a credit line at Lazy Bank Corp, and then runs up a bill in Alice’s name, Alice will be assumed responsible. It’ll affect Alice’s credit score, etc when the banks report these balances.If Alice notices these changes, they can submit a letter to the bank, demanding that the bank remove these reports and close the account (Fair Credit Reporting Act?). The bank can say “but we have the SSN of Alice, so it’s Alice’s” but if Alice can prove they’re not responsible -through lawyers or strongly worded letters or otherwise- (“I don’t and have never lived at the address on file, that IP address originated from Belarus, etc”) then the bank is legally required to remove the association between Alice and that debt. Note that filing a police report is like “auto winning” because it’s a crime to lie to the police.I think the real question is what’s the actual harm on a society level in not validating further? We already have a process to undo the harm on an individual level, but do we need more onerous procedures? replygumballindie 16 hours agoprev [–] Okta is so lame no wonder is so popular among corporate mediocrity. reply starttoaster 16 hours agoparentAs far as SaaS SSO providers go, I think they&#x27;re pretty cool.

Many apps who don&#x27;t have a connector will have docs on how to set things up with Okta, for others you&#x27;ll have to take the Okta instructions and figure out what that means for an alternate provider.

    "originBody": "REPORT ABUSE GIVE NOW ISSUES CASES WHAT WE DO MEDIA SUPPORT IJ ABOUT US SEARCH VICTORY: Appeals Court Unanimously Denies Judicial Immunity to West Virginia Judge Who Personally Searched Home, Ordered Items Removed Phillip Suderman · October 30, 2023 IJ is a public interest law firm. We represent clients free of charge in cutting-edge litigation defending vital constitutional rights. You can join us by supporting our work here: ij.org/support FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 10/30/2023 CONTACT: Phillip Suderman, psuderman@ij.org, (850) 376-4110 ARLINGTON, VA.—Today, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled in favor of Matthew Gibson in a suit against former family court judge Louise Goldston. Goldston personally led a warrantless search of Matthew’s house during a divorce proceeding Goldston oversaw, an act—that both the Fourth Circuit and West Virginia Supreme Court have now agreed—was well outside her powers as a judge. Matthew was represented by the Institute for Justice (IJ), a national non-profit law firm that protects constitutional rights. “Today is a victory not just for Matthew but for everyone who stands before a judge in a court of law and expects a fair hearing,” said Institute for Justice Senior Attorney Patrick Jaicomo. “The separation of powers exists for a reason, so that no one person can be judge, jury, and executioner. Checks and balances must be maintained to ensure a fair and free society, and judges who act beyond their constitutional mandate should not expect the protection of immunity.” “This has been a hard-fought battle, and I’m relieved to have the court agree these violations of my rights cannot stand,” added Matthew Gibson. “But I’m particularly pleased to know that the court’s ruling will not only safeguard my rights, but the rights of countless others who might otherwise suffer abuse at the hands of overstepping judges who think their robes hide them from the Constitution they are sworn to uphold.” Along with qualified immunity, judicial immunity is one of many court-created doctrines that shield government workers from constitutional accountability. But unlike qualified immunity, judicial immunity is absolute—meaning when judges do things in their judicial capacity, they simply cannot be sued. Still, judges are not entitled to do whatever they want, and then demand special treatment just because they happen to wear a robe at work. They cannot, for instance, act like police and search homes; if they do, they can’t claim judicial immunity. But that’s exactly what happened in Raleigh County, West Virginia. During divorce proceedings between Matthew and his ex-wife, Raleigh County family-court judge Louise Goldston personally forced her way into Matthew’s home under threats of arrest to search for items that were in dispute. Accompanied by Matthew’s ex-wife, her attorney, and a bailiff (among others), Goldston walked barefoot through the house, ordering Matthew’s ex-wife to seize DVDs, yearbooks, and pictures off the wall. Some of the items didn’t even belong to Matthew’s ex-wife. And when Matthew tried to record the encounter, the judge threatened him with arrest. When Matthew sued the judge for these egregious violations of constitutional rights, Goldston argued that she could not be sued even if she had violated the Constitution by invoking judicial immunity. Goldston was ultimately censured and fined, and roundly condemned, by the West Virginia high court for violating the state’s code of judicial conduct. She ended up retiring from her position amid a legislative push to impeach her for violating the rights of West Virginians. The resolution to impeach Goldston specifically mentioned the judge leading a warrantless search of Matthew’s home. Despite her retirement, Matthew and IJ continued moving forward with their lawsuit against Goldston wanting to ensure that this egregious violation wouldn’t happen again, and that the doctrine of judicial immunity would not expand. This case is a part of IJ’s Project on Immunity and Accountability, which fights to ensure that qualified, judicial, and prosecutorial immunities, among others, do not prevent individuals from vindicating their rights in court. If citizens must follow the law, government officials must follow the Constitution. # # # To arrange interviews on this subject, journalists may contact Phillip Suderman, IJ’s Communications Project Manager, at psuderman@ij.org (850) 376-4110.

No officer wants to fight a contempt charge from an angry judge. A judge ordered me arrested without issuing a warrant and it cost me three years. Only yesterday did I try a FOIA to get a copy of the non-existent warrant, here was the reply:\"Please be advised that we conducted a diligent search based on the information you provided. However, no records were found in response to your request.\" reply justinclift 1 hour agorootparentWow. What&#x27;s your next step? Are you able to get compensation, or have the judge officially censured or something? reply 77pt77 8 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s amazing that people don&#x27;t know this is the default.This is also the way debt is criminalized.The judge says you have to pay, you don&#x27;t, contempt.There was a guy imprisoned for over a decade because the judge believed he had money and was hiding it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;H._Beatty_Chadwick reply giantg2 12 hours agorootparentprevHow did it take 3 years? reply qingcharles 11 hours agorootparentI was locked up during COVID.

How exactly did they even get a court date without any documentation? reply devwastaken 11 hours agorootparentprevThe dept of justice is intentionally one of the least funded and most important orgs in the U.S. if the system of laws and enforcement were efficient you would see powerful people in prison. Therefore, it is inefficient. reply 77pt77 8 hours agorootparentprevA guy was arrested for contempt for 14 years. reply giantg2 12 hours agorootparentprev\"is why the cop helped the judge enter the house after the owner of the house pointed out she didn&#x27;t have a warrant,\"Because judges can ruin cops lives too. There&#x27;s virtually no oversight of judges. They granted themselves such secrecy that even if their disciplinary files have exculpatory evidence, you&#x27;re not allowed to subpoena it. And the discipline is usually only related to egregious acts of misconduct. Stuff like incompetence or bending the rules or being inconsistent is basically ignored.Plenty of videos online of judges being let out of reaffic stops and such while being assholes about it too. reply dragonwriter 12 hours agorootparentprevFrom the description in the article, the cop was a bailiff—a law enforcement officer working for the court to enforce the orders of the judge. reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentYes, but -- again, naively, this is not my area of expertise- I still would have expected a bailiff, when presented with a reasonable argument that the judge would be doing something illegal, to not escort the judge into the house unquestioningly. Already I think bailiffs are normally mostly limited to courthouse? reply dragonwriter 12 hours agorootparent> Yes, but -- again, naively, this is not my area of expertise- I still would have expected a bailiff, when presented with a reasonable argument that the judge would be doing something illegal, to not escort the judge into the house unquestioningly.Bailiffs&#x27; jobs are literally to provide immediate enforcement of the judges determinations of what is lawful. The normal expectation is that any legal arguments will be presented to and resolved (conclusively, for purposes of the bailiff, as any appeal will be after the execution of any orders) by the judge.> Already I think bailiffs are normally mostly limited to courthouse?Judges mostly work in the courthouse, but bailiffs aren&#x27;t generally, that I know of, limited to it so much as that being normally where they are needed by virtue of where court work tends to happen. reply pjc50 12 hours agorootparentprevlolAll these people think hierarchy first, text second; if the judge is ordering it, that&#x27;s sufficient for it to be legal. Especially in a small town. reply Crunchified 12 hours agorootparentExactly. After all, who do the police go to in order to obtain a search warrant? A judge, of course!To the police (and bailiffs, too, I would think), the judiciary is the source of all their powers. reply 77pt77 6 hours agorootparentprevWell, they are right.De facto it&#x27;s exactly like that. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentprev> why the cop helped the judge enter the house after the owner of the house pointed out she didn&#x27;t have a warrantI can understand a non-lawyer deferring to the lawyer (and judge) in their midst. If I were with my (non-judge) lawyer and they started doing something surprising, my first instinct wouldn&#x27;t be to restrain them. reply dekhn 13 hours agorootparentNot restrain the judge. Again, I&#x27;m naive here- but I still would have expected the cop to say \"Hey judge, can we talk for a second? If I underestand correctly, judges cannot perform law enforcement duty, and more importantly, there is no warrant permitting you to enter. How about we go back to the office and discuss this more widely with the police chief, as I don&#x27;t feel comfortable possibly abetting you breaking the law. If it turns out it&#x27;s OK, we can return later to obtain the items.\"My guess is the cop was simply ignorant of the law and more than happy to help the judge, ignorantly. But I&#x27;m curious if we was sanctioned or if ther was any consequence to him at all. reply JoeAltmaier 13 hours agorootparentprevEspecially since judges write warrants. It was a technicality from that point of view? reply sandworm101 12 hours agorootparentNo. A basic idea of any warrant is that you need two people to do something. If judges can write, sign and execute warrants, then we are into Judge Dred territory.There is also a general principal that lawyers and judges should not turn themselves into witnesses. This judge just made herself a witness should any siezed material need be debated in court. Judges dont attend lineups or medical tests, nor should they attened searches. reply JoeAltmaier 5 hours agorootparentAll very true.But speaking just to the issue being asked here, why didn&#x27;t anybody respond to a search being warrantless, the presence of the judge may have muddied that for the reason I suggested.Everything else was fucked up, as you say. reply __derek__ 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, that&#x27;s a naive view of American law enforcement. reply konstantinua00 13 hours agoparentprev> barefoot...why was this detail added? i-is it even positive or negative? did the writer have foot fetish or shoes fetish?one word, but many more questions reply alwa 12 hours agorootparentIt seems like another detail supporting the idea that this “search” was highly irregular, casting it as far removed from a legitimate, professional exercise of official power.We’re lucky as hacker types that we can sometimes do our jobs barefoot and in casual clothes, but I can’t think of any situation (other than this one) where an agent of the state executes their official duties unshod. reply sandworm101 12 hours agorootparentFighter pilots. Search and rescue crews. I have personally seen more than a few at work in socks or bare feet. If your job requires you to quickly don survival kit or flightsuits, you hang around at work without shoes on. Also some military air traffic controllers and operations people on long shifts. I have done more than a few late nights at desks beside colored telephones, not always with my boots on.And I know of some occassions where cops have taken off thier boots when entering certain religeous places. reply bondarchuk 12 hours agorootparentprevLifeguards! reply pjc50 12 hours agorootparentprevIt implies unprofessionality on behalf of the barefoot person. And possibly haste or even mental instability. Normally law enforcement wear substantial shoes or boots to avoid accidental or malicious injury. You never know if you&#x27;re searching someone&#x27;s house if they&#x27;ve left tacks out on the floor. reply op00to 12 hours agorootparentprevI would never execute a search barefoot. Only a mad person would consider that professional. reply eftychis 13 hours agorootparentprevWhy barefoot exactly? Something is missing here. When you execute a search it is not like you go around removing shoes. Then again usually that search and seizure is legal and not executed by the \"judge...\" reply kolanos 14 hours agoparentprev> This sounds like the ex-wife was close friend with the judge and this was very personal.

In many other cultures it is considered much more disrespectful and disgusting to wear outdoor shoes inside a home. reply hotnfresh 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not fear of bare feet, it&#x27;s this official coming by, backed by cops, to take your shit, but then doing something that either reads as very familiar or else quite respectful (but in a pretty minor way).It&#x27;s like a burglar who takes your grandma&#x27;s jewelry, and eats a sandwich out of the fridge while they&#x27;re at it, but is careful to wipe up all the crumbs and load the plate in the dishwasher. WTF? reply georgeecollins 13 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it is a fear of bare feet exactly, its more like Americans often wear shoes in their houses. Taking off your shoes is a bit more casual so it implies a sort of familiarity.Americans also don&#x27;t typically (you can&#x27;t completely generalize) have rooms where you sit on the floor or a mat. In cultures where you do that it makes even more sense to take off your shoes. They also typically have really big houses compared to a lot of other places, with bigger lots that contain indoor or outdoor spaces. In my own house, you could walk in the front door, walk through the living room or dining room and just continue the conversation in the patio furniture in the back yard. I think its cleaner to take off your shoes, and people sometimes do when they come to visit, or ask if they should. reply crooked-v 11 hours agorootparentWearing shoes in houses really depends on region. Do that in New England and somebody&#x27;s going to (possibly literally) scream at you for tracking in the snow or mud. reply mcpackieh 13 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not some sort of footphobia (where does America even come into this? I am American and taking off shoes is the custom in any house that somebody makes a pretense of keeping clean. Do you think we all live in barns?) It&#x27;s about the judge not having any of trappings of a judicial proceeding, she wasn&#x27;t wearing a robe and was generally behaving very informally. Taking off her shoes was part of that. Taking off her shoes to protect the floor shouldn&#x27;t have ever come up because she should never have been in the house in the first place. Since she wasn&#x27;t acting like a judge, she wasn&#x27;t entitled to judicial immunity. reply matheusmoreira 13 hours agorootparent> where does America even come into this?> I am American and taking off shoes is the custom in any house that somebody makes a pretense of keeping clean.I&#x27;ve watched way too many movies depicting americans wearing shoes not only inside their home but in bed.

Is it true? reply khazhoux 13 hours agorootparent> I&#x27;ve watched way too many movies depicting americans wearing shoes not only inside their home but in bedThis indeed is how Hollywood popularly depicted Americans, as wearing shoes to bed, in the bathtub or shower, while swimming, and so on. There&#x27;s the famous line the the Humphrey Bogart &#x2F; Katherine Hepburn film \"A Time To Stand\" where the robbers tell Bogie they&#x27;re going to clean him out, and he says \"you can take anything you want, but you&#x27;re not getting my shoes!\"There was an episode of This American Life where they delved into Hollywood&#x27;s preoccupation with people never (ever) taking off their shoes, and one of the things they go into is how Johnston & Murphy (old shoe company) was one of the biggest funders of the original Silver Age studios. It was maybe the first instance of product placement, right up there with cigarettes. Of course Congress eventually got involved in the late 50s and pushed the shoe industry out, paving the way for movies like George Pal&#x27;s \"The Time Machine\" which scandalously showed Yvette Mimiuex&#x27;s bare feet. The French were laughing at us, though, with directors life Truffaut and Godard already showing casual barefootedness in their experimental shorts (\"La Pantoufle Perdue\" being the best-known and most influential). reply RoyalHenOil 13 hours agorootparentprevIt is normal for Americans to wear shoes indoors, but it is also normal for Americans to have a no-shoes-indoors policy.To a large extent, it depends on the local environment. In places that are snowy, muddy, or sandy, people are more likely to expect guests to not wear shoes past the mud room.

She usually required the consent of both parties legal representation before going through with it. The guy involved represented himself and didn’t realize he should have objected until it was too late and they were there. He’d been held in contempt for allegedly not turning over property she had ordered him to, which he said he didn’t have, and entering the house and searching it was her way of establishing that.

Elections are by definition partisan things, even when you don&#x27;t list party.

Yeah it prevents someone from just pulling a straight-ticket lever in the booth without doing any research but that&#x27;s about it.Your average voter has absolutely no business deciding the quality of someone&#x27;s legal education, scholarship, etc. Hell one state I lived in most of the \"judges\" handling minor offenses like traffic tickets and small claims court had never been to law school, never served in any criminal justice role, they just ran for the seat and got it.

The politician doing the appointments will surely pick judges that align with their party&#x27;s ideals.In the best case, when the executive and the legislature are in opposition—and appointments must clear both branches—then you have opposing forces that hopefully weed out the most partisan of judges.My proposal is to have candidate judges throw their name on a list. Whenever a spot needs filling, then each of 3 committees makes their selections from that list. Those 3 committees would be (1) current judges, (2) prosecutors, and (3) defense attorneys.Only if a majority of each group blesses a candidate, would that candidate be eligible for appointment by the governor. reply __derek__ 12 hours agorootparentprevAppointed judges are just another form of patronage.

Her replacement was appointed by the governor with no mention of it being interim u til an election.Edit2: they are indeed elected, with eight year terms, which is why I did not see it.

How is this not obvious? reply whatshisface 13 hours agorootparentThe problem is that it was apparently far less obvious 50 years ago... The sheer number of conservatives who have been caught doing it shows it&#x27;s some kind of ex post facto social norm.

There should probably be some kind of accepted system of forgiveness... but the culture is run by its second most progressive so I only expect it to be available for those who merely failed to be the absolute most progressive. I have a good track record of being the absolute most progressive for what it&#x27;s worth. reply true_religion 11 hours agorootparentI don’t think it’s a problem to accept that people have changed their ways, but pretty much in all cases of blackface people either deny it like the governor or pretend it’s not a big deal like the attorney general.If anyone were to confront me on my record on gay marriage, I’d apologize myself. I thought civil unions were the best option, because I come from a country where government marriage and traditional (e.g. tribal or church) marriage are totally separate systems governed by different laws.

But, you&#x27;d think in 2021, someone thinking about running for public office might take a few minutes, sit down, and run through the checklist. You know, the basics: Did I ever rape anyone? Was I in the KKK? Did I ever wear blackface? reply whatshisface 12 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s an, \"arson, murder and jaywalking\" list if I have ever heard one. :-)And no, I think that when those teenagers were donning their offensive Halloween costumes, they did not think it was going to cause serious offense decades in the future. reply true_religion 11 hours agorootparentIn this case, the governor wasn’t a teenager. He was a 27 year old medical school student when the yearbook photo was taken.To make matters worse, this was the same year his school had its first black student so many white students were using the yearbook as an excuse to protest. reply csa 12 hours agorootparentprev> Did I ever rape anyone? Was I in the KKK? Did I ever wear blackface?I think this is a gross oversimplification. Let me modernize the questions for the current era (since the alleged infractions were decades ago):1. Have I ever touch someone romantically in any way without asking for explicit permission and receiving explicit approval?This is the alleged “standard” these days, although I think that it is only strictly adhered to in one very narrow social group. Overall, “feeling safe” and “respect” seems to be more common than it was many decades ago, but those are still a far cry from explicit consent at every step that some folks use as a “standard”.So if a potential politician cannot answer yes to this, then they leave themselves to being accused of being a rapist and&#x2F;or sexual predator.2. Am I in a social group that has a racial mix that does not approximate the local ratios (esp. if white)?California, where I live, is taking stances on equality that focus on outcomes more than opportunities.An unfortunate byproduct of this is that a group that is open to all groups, has members of at least all major groups, and has no policy or pattern of discrimination can still be called racist if their racial ratios are not at a certain level.This basically means that most private clubs are “racist” by this definition.Moose, Rotary, Chambers of Commerce, golf clubs, fraternities and sororities, American Legion branches, Masons (even Prince Hall), etc. are all organizations that have active members now that could be deemed “racist” if “racism” is defined as equality of outcome (as it is currently in CA K-12 education).Any potential policitian who is a member of one of these groups runs the risk of being called a racist.3. Have I ever worn a costume of a character that is not my race?Moana, Mulan, Tiana, Jasmine, Pocahontas, are some Disney characters that are potentially out of bounds.Luke Cage, Blue Marvel, Storm, Blade, Misty Knight, Black Panther, and Moon Girl are Marvel characters that are potentially out of bounds.Any potential politician has to make sure that they have not worn any of these sorts of costumes, since at some point they may be accused of being racist or engaging in cultural appropriation.Times change, people make mistakes, people grow… we need to allow space for this, especially when a questionable action was not done with malicious intent. reply whatshisface 12 hours agorootparentThe KKK was a violent organization 100 years ago, there is no surprise that it would disqualify you from office. Literally nobody in that group is surprised to find that outsiders think they are too racist... reply csa 11 hours agorootparent> The KKK was a violent organization 100 years ago, there is no surprise that it would disqualify you from office.1. David Duke, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK, held elected office in Louisiana from 1989 to 1992.Not only do I think that it did not disqualify him, I’m guessing his former office helped him get elected.2. Strom Thurmond, who was a vocal critic of integration and was in the Senate until 2003 (he was over 100yo), was a known racist. He later supported desegregation, but his racist attitudes in his personal life (e.g., word usage) allegedly didn’t change much.Despite being very regressive in many of his views, he continued to get elected to office for over four decades (until 20 years ago, mind you), and he wielded immense power in the Senate.3. There are no shortage of current national-level politicians, like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tommy Tuberville, who make explicit racist comments and plenty of dog whistle racist comments. They seem to have no problem getting elected.Being racist or violent only very narrowly limits potential political positions one can run for, imho. reply whatshisface 11 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re drawing conclusions from the most extreme politicians you can find in the deepest backwaters of this nation.

However when you are running for elected office, you need to admit your faults and not hide them.If you want to be private about rape allegations, and incidents of racism, sexism, or harassment of any protected minority group then you ought to simply be a private citizen.Otherwise the public deserves to know. How many people would have not voted for the governor if they knew his past was something he still denied, and had not come to terms with? reply csa 10 hours agorootparent> If you want to be private about rape allegations, and incidents of racism, sexism, or harassment of any protected minority groupI think the problems with all of these is that they are not always clear and they change over time.I’ve mentioned some examples in another part of this thread, but to summarize:1. If you have not asked explicit permission and received an affirmative response at every stage of a romantic endeavor ever, you can be accused of sexual assault or rape. The affirmative response can be deemed invalid if any alcohol was involved, and can be plausibly denied if there was no written agreement (these actually happen).2. “Racism” can be something as simple as wearing a costume of a character that is not your race (think Moana or Blue Marvel), or being a member of a group that doesn’t have the right racial ratios (even if there are no discriminatory policies or practices).3. You can be considered to be a harasser of a protected minority group for doing things like using the word “niggardly” (not etymologically a race-based word) or assigning the book To Kill a Mockingbird as a teacher.These may seem like extreme examples, but these are all things that are happening right now, and I think it’s safe to say that the vanilla forms of all of the actions mentioned above don’t warrant a confession from a potential politician.… yet there are people that will have no problems tarnishing a potential politician’s reputation via highly subjective allegations alone if they don’t agree with that person’s politics.For examples of each of the above, search for):1. Harvard “rape” case in the 00s, and Duke lacrosse team.2. Silicon Valley hiring practices. Also see most cases where the term “cultural appropriation” is weaponized.3. WaPo article (today?) about TKM. “Water buffalo” case at UPenn in the 90s.

Without the retrospective view and full knowledge of January 6, “storming the Capitol” appears in a different light, if you concerned about the mens rea of the delegate. It is likely that the vast majority of people that day, the hardliner crazies excepted, had no idea or expectation they’d be facing charges. reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentI agree, entering the capitol in a peaceful was is not unusual (we saw an occupation of the rotunda only a few days ago).But from the very first moments the aggresive crowd was gathering outside the capitol, it was pretty clear it was a lawless event (I watched the whole thing realtime on several different news sources). For example if the door to the capitol is locked and people start breaking windows to enter... that moves from \"protest\" to \"storming\" pretty much instantly.

My point is that just showing up to a protest in or at the Capitol is not really an unusual thing, and most of the people there, probably including the delegate, had no idea there’d be any consequences.Peaceful is sort of a spectrum too - it’s not uncommon for Congressmen and their assistants to get shoved a little, screamed at in their faces, spit on, that sort of thing. Sort of an occupational hazard. Sometimes it makes for great photographs. Certainly what happened that day exceeded the norm, though, which meant a lot of people who showed up with legal motives got wrapped up in something else.

Perhaps the burden of proof should not be so onerous.Maybe the solution is that the employer (in this case the WV judiciary) has the option to accept liability. If they do so, immunity is presumed. If the employer rejects the liability, then the individual must prove that they are entitled to immunity.Obviously there&#x27;s a financial incentive for an employer to deny liability, but doing so would be extremely unpopular with employees. So presumably they would be judicious depending on the circumstances. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentprev> This judge&#x27;s actions were not a \"mistake\", they were a deliberate abuse of power.They also weren&#x27;t within the coverage of judicial immunity, so that&#x27;s irrelevant. reply michael1999 14 hours agorootparentprevIndemnification against civil liability is very different from immunity from criminal prosecution.Any employer can provide liability insurance, but only the Supreme Count can grant carte-blanche to commit crimes. reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparent> Indemnification against civil liability is very different from immunity from criminal prosecutionNeither qualified nor judicial immunity provide for immunity from criminal prosecution. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparentprev> Indemnification against civil liability is very different from immunity from criminal prosecution.Qualified, judicial, and absolute immunities are (among others) immunities from civil, not criminal, liability that apply to public officials in different conditions. reply thorncorona 13 hours agorootparentprevIsn&#x27;t the president the only one who can technically do that through pardon?Supreme court can only rule they are legal under current laws. reply dragonwriter 13 hours agorootparent> Isn&#x27;t the president the only one who can technically do that through pardon?No, so can individual prosecutors and Congress, through immunity grants. reply mcpackieh 13 hours agorootparentprev> This is like saying employees should be personally liable for mistakes they make at work.This is like saying a dentist shouldn&#x27;t be personally liable for the \"mistake\" of raping somebody under his care.

And the sacrifices that younger employees are willing to make might help change the tides. The concessions younger workers are willing to make Despite the popular belief that younger generations are champions of remote work, one-third of Gen Z and millennial workers say they’d be willing to work fully in-person if it meant shaving a day off of their workweek. “If a company wants to bring younger workers back [into the office], maybe this is the perk they should look into,” says Foster. Other sacrifices that Gen Z and millennial employees say they’d make in exchange for a four-day workweek include working longer hours (48%), changing jobs or companies (35%), working weekends or evenings (27%) and even taking a pay cut (13%). The Bankrate data is a sign that younger generations are prioritizing work-life balance and “recognizing that flexibility itself is a job perk,” Foster says. Older generations also show a strong interest in the four-day workweek, with over 86% of Gen X and baby boomer workers saying that they’d be willing to give something up in exchange for a shorter week. There is one sacrifice that older workers are more inclined to make when compared with Gen Z and millennial workers: 61% say they would work longer hours to attain a four-day workweek. But Gen Xers and baby boomers trail behind younger workers in other concessions they’d be willing to make, likely due to the fact that they’ve worked five-day schedules for most of their careers. “Older generations, they’ve gotten in the habit of working these schedules, they know life before the coronavirus pandemic,” says Foster. “There’s something to be said about maybe not wanting to pursue that taste of flexibility the way that younger generations probably do.” What will it take for four-day workweeks to become the norm? The 40-hour workweek has been commonplace since the Great Depression, so it’s hardly a surprise that employers remain resistant to change — in 2023, only 15% of U.S. workers say their employer offers a four-day workweek to promote positive mental health, according to payroll analysis company ADP. While it would likely take government intervention to introduce widespread change, a rise in workers showing interest in companies that currently offer four-day workweeks could help drive a shift, Foster says. “Once some companies start offering [four-day workweeks] and once many workers start to apply for those positions … it might actually end up putting more pressure on companies to introduce this non-traditional perk,” she says. While workers wanting a four-day workweek probably have the best luck looking for positions within companies that already offer it, employees pining for this perk within their employer should broach workweek conversations like they do pay negotiations, Foster says. “It makes sense to think of the business case for switching to this schedule and the way it could help the bottom line of your company,” she says. “Speaking your company’s language could be the best step to secure more work-life balance, but it might end up being a baby step.” If you’re going to initiate conversations around more flexible schedules, now might be the right time — Foster says workers should capitalize on the bargaining power they’re seeing from the robust job market while it lasts. “I would say that now is really the time to start looking into more flexible options and use this strong job market to your advantage while you can,” she says.

I asked HR why everything else was negotiable except PTO and they told me I would have more time off then people who&#x27;ve been there for 7+ years.This was my first clue that there was a lot of momentum to keep you dependent on your employer and it doesn&#x27;t stop with a paycheck. 10-12 days per year really restricts your mobility. Instead of backpacking through SE Asia for a month I basically used that time for Thanksgiving and&#x2F;or Christmas.BTW, having 3 days off means you can sprinkle on additional vacation time throughout the year. I&#x27;m not surprised Gen-Z would negotiate less vacation time if they could use it more effectively. reply dkdbejwi383 20 hours agoparentI&#x27;m Australian but have lived in Europe for a long time. When I begin to consider moving back, one of the things that puts me off is that 4 weeks is pretty much universal in Australia, plus in Australia I think it&#x27;s pretty standard to have a fixed number of days you&#x27;re allowed to be sick. I&#x27;m too used to having 6 weeks holidays and essentially unlimited sick leave (as long as it&#x27;s legitimately required).It&#x27;s a more grown-up arrangement where businesses realise that regular time off (and as much time as you need if ill) increases happiness and therefore productivity.I still miss the food at home, though. reply agravier 20 hours agorootparentI work for an Australian company in Australia and they&#x27;ll give me paid sick leave beyond the standard allowance if I need it.

I asked HR why everything else was negotiable except PTO and they told me I would have more time off then people who&#x27;ve been there for 7+ years.One of the reasons I work in the education sector is the generous (compared to startups &#x2F; most tech companies, anyway) PTO.We get all of the big holidays off (I think 12) and we have 2-4 weeks of vacation (depending on length of employment) and we have two weeks of paid medical leave (which accumulates, so after the first couple of years you have massive amounts banked) and paid maternity&#x2F;paternity.Mine isn&#x27;t the only employer like this, there are plenty of others, it&#x27;s not hard to find one. The key to look for is \"work life balance.\" Government jobs, non-profits, education, these sorts of areas - they know they can&#x27;t compete with tech company salaries but can make up for it in other ways. PTO is only a part of that.It&#x27;s not quite the 4 day a week dream job, but there are options available if you look. And as a bonus, you might find yourself more aligned with the mission of the organization than you would at a for-profit tech company. reply tbihl 19 hours agorootparentIn my experience, it&#x27;s really hard to deal with 4 day weeks in education, but maybe just because I was trying to schedule week-long courses. I was at a job that observed 4 day weekends for every single federal holiday which, in practice, meant that you had 2 4-day weeks and 2 5-day weeks each month. It felt very hard to get stuff done generally, but that may have been a characteristic of the native speed of the bureaucracy in that particular org (4 day weekends were relatively new) or the fact that face-to-face work was prioritized due to nearly-nonfunctioning computers. reply ryandrake 14 hours agoparentprev> They wouldn&#x27;t budge.I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem specific to PTO. In general, after 20+ years of working, I&#x27;ve found US employers to be pretty inflexible on all terms&#x2F;aspects of your working life besides compensation. They may (or often may not) be willing to negotiate pay, but will almost never budge when it comes to:- Vacation &#x2F; PTO- Unpaid leave- Health benefits- Financial benefits like 401(k) or life insurance- IP ownership- Moonlighting or second jobs- Schedule flexibility- Paid training- Company equipmentThese things tend to be \"take it or leave it--we won&#x27;t accept changes to our boilerplate agreement!\" reply yardie 13 hours agorootparentAny half competent HR system can keep track of it. I know because part of my job was managing those systems. Setting PTO was simply advancing a digit in a field in a giant HR database. Not exactly rocket science.BTW, senior executives had far more flexibility when it came to PTO, leave, pensions, bonuses, IP, etc. And it was managed in the same system that frontline employees were managed from.It&#x27;s not about complexity, it&#x27;s about control. reply pb7 14 hours agorootparentprevNot to defend them one bit but it’s very likely because a lot of that stuff is hard to keep track of. If you only have one policy that everyone is subject to, it can be easily tracked&#x2F;updated&#x2F;cost calculated&#x2F;etc. The bigger the company, the less likely they will craft a custom policy for you. reply jollofricepeas 19 hours agoparentprevThis is interesting.In the US, I have found that what HR will tell you is different than what your hiring manager will enforce.My hiring managers were often much more permissive and allowed 4 day work weeks and “unlimited” time off provided it was not detrimental to the team. This also meant that when there was a legitimate emergency; they expected you to assist.I have heard many horror stories but have been luck not to experience most of them at this point in my career. reply yardie 19 hours agorootparentUnofficial requests are exactly that. We don&#x27;t like planning long, expensive trips based on what the manager is feeling that week or quarter.I&#x27;ve circled the sun long enough (and dealt with enough military recruiters, LOL) to know that you get it all in writing. Any implied or verbal agreements aren&#x27;t really worth much. reply ripply 20 hours agoparentprevThis is the one thing I really hate about American work culture. It really is pervasive throughout the economy, capitalism here optimizes for money over happiness and there just aren’t many companies that are willing to release their grip on you. My employer is now trying to transition to three days a week in the office and the reasoning is totally capitalistic even though it will most likely reduce overall happiness, they also will not approve a month off PTO even though it’s apparently unlimited, the reasoning was basically “we don’t work that way”.So many things are wrong with American work culture and there’s nothing most people can do about it. reply 62951413 18 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know about the US but in the Bay Area PTO hasn&#x27;t been negotiable for about seven years.

I was paying $800 a month for a two bedroom apartment, and what was left over was enough to comfortably support me and my wife. Entry level salary for the same job is now about $120K, meaning someone in that position can easily afford to pay $1920 a month for rent. According to Zillow, that same apartment is now renting for $2305 a month.So what we&#x27;re hand-wringing about is a ~$385 increase in rent, which comes to about 4% more of the person&#x27;s gross salary than 25 years ago. That sucks a little bit, but it&#x27;s not a catastrophe.And on top of that, you can still make a ton of side money through bonuses and stock, in the industry that I assume we&#x27;re mostly talking about.

But that&#x27;s less to do with square footage of living space and more to do with square footage available to store hoarded items.EG: such folk (now narrowing perspective to anecdotes of room mates I&#x27;ve had) often wind up placated by access to space in the garage plus a rented storage unit that they literally never visit between when they move in with us and when they move back out perhaps a year or two later.Our place is a three bedroom unit within a triplex building built in the late 70s and falling apart. Its&#x27; rent has recently increased to close to half of all of our net incomes combined. We would like to live somewhere within walking distance (a mile?) of basic necessities, that we can afford, and if its not too much to ask perhaps also is not falling apart.Number of square feet holds no interest to us but number of bedrooms would be nice so that each adult can have one to sleep in.My apologies if that strikes you as too \"quaint\" and you&#x27;d rather force us to live 50 miles from the nearest store beyond the reach of basic utilities just because then the rent and&#x2F;or mortgage payments would be half what we get here. reply dutchCourage 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find some overly idealistic people in the mix, but the article mentions clear trade-offs that young workers are willing to take.Some of them are willing to take a pay cut in order to work less, and they&#x27;re being called lazy for it.

On the opposite, I believe I&#x27;m less productive on Mondays and even less after longer holidays (I believe it&#x27;s basically loss of context and \"work mood\").I personally also do programming in my free time (usually at least an hour a day), so it&#x27;s not like the overall load is too much.Having said that, I would love to have a 4-day week, especially without lost compensation. But to me this idea that there&#x27;s no productivity loss looks to me very much like wishful thinking. reply saulpw 19 hours agorootparent> Personal anecdote - I don&#x27;t work full 40 with full intensity, I do slack a lot. But it&#x27;s not like I work hard for the first 32 hours and then slack all Friday. It&#x27;s more like I work hard for 2 hours and then slack for the next hour, because the mental load is just too intense.I felt this way too, but it&#x27;s a reaction to chronic brain tiredness. When I was working a 4 day workweek, I remember noticing on Tuesday that I only had a couple of days until the end of the week, so I better buckle down if I wanted to get something done. And then I did. Having that reliable 3-day weekend meant that I really focused on work when I was at work. And I was able to schedule \"bank appointments\" on my Friday off, instead of having to take time during the workweek.I know it seems like wishful thinking, but I was demonstrably more productive, more sustainably, in that 4-day&#x2F;week job, than any 5-day&#x2F;week job I&#x27;ve ever had. reply vladvasiliu 20 hours agorootparentprev> A 4 day work week today means working 4 days a week for the same money as a person working 5 days a weekSure, but you&#x27;ll have even less hope for a salary increase next year, since this is basically what it is.This was the theory behind France&#x27;s move to the 35-hour workweek, too. They also expected companies to hire more people to compensate for less work being done. Didn&#x27;t work out as expected. reply ramraj07 20 hours agorootparentWhat happened in France?The way I see it, as programmers we will be far more productive working fewer days per week and just taking more time to relax. If this assumption is accurate you have to do nothing to compensate. reply vladvasiliu 20 hours agorootparentSure, I think there&#x27;s a big difference between programmers (and similar) and the situation in France at the time, when most people affected by this were factory workers, who didn&#x27;t have themselves much influence over how productive they were (aside from the obvious issues of not showing up &#x2F; slacking off).Basically, \"nothing\" happened. The expected drop in unemployment never materialized. And although pay rises never were an expected effect of the change (from what I know), they were negatively impacted.I&#x27;m not knowledgeable enough in those matters, so I may be off base, but it would seem that companies started to be less \"competitive\" when the rule started to be applied, in 2000-2002. But from what I&#x27;ve read on the subject, none of the sides (for and against the measure) can prove that it was undoubtedly a good or a bad thing.> The way I see it, as programmers we will be far more productive working fewer days per week and just taking more time to relax. If this assumption is accurate you have to do nothing to compensate.I agree with this. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m not in a position to make this kind of decision. And it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that many managers don&#x27;t think this way, and somehow figure that your productivity is roughly constant and proportional to the time your butt spends in your seat (at least up to a point). replynunez 19 hours agoprevI hope the four day workweek is an actual four day workweek (I.e. 32 hr weeks) and not 10x4&#x27;s. Those are worse. reply jt2190 21 hours agoprevSource for the article:“Younger workers want a 4-day workweek — and some would give up remote work or higher pay for it” https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankrate.com&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;younger-workers-wa...> Close to 8 in 10 Gen X and baby boomer workers (or 78 percent for those between the ages of 43 and 77 combined) support a four-day workweek.> But younger workers indicate they’re willing to go to greater lengths for the schedule, and it sets them apart. More than 9 in 10 of Gen Z and millennial workers who prefer a four-day work week (or 92 percent) would still be willing to work that schedule if it meant giving something up, versus 86 percent of Gen X and baby boomers.> The steps those younger workers say they would be willing to take include working longer hours (48 percent), changing jobs or companies (35 percent) and coming into the office or working fully in person (33 percent) to have three days off a week. Some would even be willing to take less vacation time (20 percent), accept a pay cut (13 percent) or take a step back in their careers (12 percent) for it. reply sharemywin 21 hours agoparentThe title makes it sound like they&#x27;d sacrifice allot but when you look at the percentages it&#x27;s mostly just I&#x27;d like to work 4-10s. reply safety1st 21 hours agorootparentWhich is interesting, because I feel like I&#x27;m lucky when I have the focus to do even 4 hours of high intensity, cognitively demanding work in a day. Much of the rest of that day is fluffing around, meetings or doing stuff that seems like it could probably be delegated or automated with the right setup. reply sharemywin 16 hours agorootparentwhich is why they would happily support it. I&#x27;ll sit around for another 2 hours and give you the same 4 hours worth of work.I feel like people that do meeting all day have no idea how draining coding is.Hey, I can&#x27;t look at code for longer than 2 seconds but could you spend 8 hours doing it. reply Arrath 21 hours agorootparentprevThe happiest stint of my career was working steady 4-10s. So yeah, I fully support the idea. reply SamuelAdams 21 hours agoparentprevIf they (or you, or anyone) want a 4 day work week, then why not pick a profession that allows it? Most healthcare related fields work in 12 hour shifts, so working 3-4 days a week is the normal standard.Not every professional job is an office job 9-5. reply NeoTar 20 hours agorootparentBecause changing a profession is really hard, and at a certain point in your life basically impossible without a big pay cut. reply doctorwho42 20 hours agorootparentprevBecause the implication is that a 4 day work week would be 8 hour days. Not 4 days with 40+ hours. reply footy 19 hours agorootparentprevwhy would you think software doesn&#x27;t allow it? I know plenty of people who work 4 day workweeks, including myself. reply epups 20 hours agoprevThis is a huge trend in Europe. A sizable portion of people I know are simply deciding to work as little as possible, even if that means getting paid less. The general perception is that there is no point in saving for a house or for retirement, and many perceive the career ladder game to be a fool&#x27;s errand. So they just want to get enough money to live at present. reply harryquach 19 hours agoprevOld people will also! reply sonicanatidae 18 hours agoprevOlder people as well. :) reply nine_zeros 21 hours agoprevIf there&#x27;s one thing that has truly happened with the pandemic, it&#x27;s that it has exposed the psychopathy of grinding in corporations, and made people more aware of the value of their own lives. Thus, leading to large masses of people not caring about the corporate and management nonsense.For folks who are concerned about younglings not working hard enough or China will take over or some other boomer ideology, this is even happening among youth in developing countries.Solution: People want to be treated with respect and dignity. That&#x27;s it. As long as companies treat people as fungible factory workers, companies will be in a constant churn of employees - especially as the newer generations are smaller in size. reply SamuelAdams 21 hours agoprev [–] If they (or you, or anyone) want a 4 day work week, then why not pick a profession that allows it?

Same thing could be argued when five-day work weeks were first proposed. reply Clubber 19 hours agorootparentI think his point is you can have a 4 day week now and not have to wait for corporations to comply (good luck with that). reply Mashimo 20 hours agoparentprev> why not pick a profession that allows it? > Most healthcare related fields work in 12 hour shiftsI don&#x27;t know, but I guess working 12 hour shift has something to do with it. Around where I live healthcare workers are also often on strike because of low wage and poor working conditions. reply DangitBobby 20 hours agoparentprevNo sweat, let me just go back to school and learn to be a healthcare professional. reply SamuelAdams 17 hours agorootparentI never said it would be easy: most things in life that are important are not easy.The point is that there are many different types of jobs with a variety of benefits, including non-traditional scheduling. If that is something important to you, why not work towards it?Healthcare is just one example. It’s not perfect either, there are problems for sure. But that is ok for some people who value something like a 3-4 day work week. No job is perfect, it’s all about what trade offs make it worth it to the employee. reply culopatin 20 hours agoparentprevI think this should be a common sense rule: If your statement starts with “why don’t they just” or some sort of variant: Think about it twice.You’re suggesting that 92% of the young workforce concentrates on the few jobs with extended shifts. 92% of the next gen of workers will not be working a 9-5 in your scenario. reply datavirtue 20 hours agoparentprev [–] Oil fields.
