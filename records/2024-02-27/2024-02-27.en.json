Superset allowed us to replace Tableau and not looking back Took me a while figure out how to embed it into my app using Superset Embedded SDK. Superset Embedded SDK - \"Embedded SDK allows you to embed dashboards from Superset into your own app, using your app's authentication. Embedding is done by inserting an iframe, containing a Superset page, into the host application.\" https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/superset-embe... Superset is based on very high quality and well maintained chart library eChart https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/#chart-type-linesG Community Roadmap https://github.com/apache/superset/projects?query=is%3Aopen Huge respect to Preset.io and its team for contributing to the project and keep it in a great shape https://preset.io/blog/ Superset source code is very easy to read and understand, and as a result it's possible to implement some advanced caching techniques reduce the load on charts. No BI is perfect. Watching Superset for years gives me confidence the project will work as supposed down the road, and eventually some of its packages can be reusable for all kind of visualizations and data hacking. Our main approach to visualisation is to start with eChart and simple Reactjs wrapping and spin off Superset on subdomain for power users, and later see which one works better. Same look gives a very pleasant experience. reply hughess 16 hours agoparentWe use ECharts in our open source BI tool (Evidence) and it's a great library.

DataView looks cool - love the ability to define the tables in code inline in the markdown. That's similar to how we inline DuckDB WASM SQL queries in markdown: https://docs.evidence.dev/core-concepts/queries/ reply archiewood 10 hours agorootparentprevI love Obsidian. The MarkdownMarkup typing experience is just so good compared to e.g. Slack, Reddit and other markdown-esque tools reply klaussilveira 15 hours agoparentprevHow do you deal with data visibility and permissions? I mean, most tables have data that should only be seen by a specific user or group ID, and that layer is usually handled by the application. It would be awesome to expose the power of Superset for users, but I imagine creating the security layer would be a pain. reply spdustin 13 hours agorootparentYou can use row-level security, or specify RBAC with pretty much any SQL query. reply re5i5tor 15 hours agorootparentprevI have this question too reply Ringz 14 hours agorootparenthttps://superset.apache.org/docs/security/ reply prabhatsharma 9 hours agoparentpreveCharts is awesome. We moved from plotly after using it for several months to echarts at https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve and are super happy. reply Jzush 16 hours agoparentprevI’d like to see these types of apps start offering SVG embedding of things like graphs. Frames are such a pain. reply wswope 9 hours agorootparentBokeh is an option in the frontend-viz space that puts out pretty solid SVG for statically-rendered charts, while also having the option of more Tableau-like interactive functionality with input fields, dynamic filters, etc. Might be a decent option for you? Their interactive \"embedded-mode\" avoids iframes too... but it's built with web components, so you wind up in shadow-DOM hell if you want to do anything dynamic on the view's contents. reply rusackas 11 hours agorootparentprevThat's probably not trivial, but it seems plausible. The beauty of open source is that you can help contribute this if you're fired up about it! reply boyka 17 hours agoparentprevI have no experience with Superset. Can you elaborate on a few points where you see it excel beyond Tableau? reply adeptima 17 hours agorootparentI dont want to start a rant against Tableau. It's a powerhouse. It's a great superior software. But when it comes to optimizing cost and comparing the total cost of ownership and opportunity to stop paying for Tableau server license we voted in favor of Superset and mix of Reactjs+Echarts widgets. https://www.tableau.com/products/server If you have money, dedicated team of data analytics who are already familiar with Tableau - no need to torture them with other tools. reply skadamat 17 hours agorootparentHonestly it's so hard to compare Tableau and Superset. Tableau has every feature and bell / whistle imagine-able. But it's heavy, desktop oriented, and pricey. Superset is lightweight and open source, but only has 5% of the features. So it really depends what you need! reply marcinzm 18 hours agoprev> Superset is fast, lightweight, intuitive, and loaded with options that make it easy for users of all skill sets to explore and visualize their data, from simple line charts to highly detailed geospatial charts. I tried Superset a few years back, and maybe it's changed since then, but intuitive is about the last thing I'd use to describe it. Things which I could figure out in a few minutes on any other BI tool literally took me hours of searching. It didn't help that they decided to rename core concepts at some point so half the online documentation made no sense anymore. Others at those companies who tried it at the time said similar things. reply fayten 18 hours agoparentI also found Superset unintuitive to use and setup as well. I settled on standing up Metabase because it was so simple to get started with trying it since it can be launched as a single jar. The business users loved it and so did I and administration with a Postgres backend instead of the internal h2 database was a breeze. reply datadrivenangel 17 hours agorootparentMetabase is great. It truly is a BI tool. Superset is more of a visualization platform, which works great if you have engineers building reports. Less good if you expect more junior analysts to be super productive. reply sumoboy 17 hours agorootparentWe ran into the same exact issue with Superset not being intuitive, just for a different audience that is more technical. Also went with Metabase which is good, easy to use, lacks some a few chart types but overall the past year has seen quite a few changes and bug fixes consistently happening. reply hodgesrm 6 hours agorootparentprevMy experience with Superset was the opposite. It's easy to install using containers. You can have it up and running and connected to ClickHouse in a few minutes. I also found the internal design pretty intuitive--the SQL query lab is much easier than Grafana's editor. I like Grafana too, but there's basically no isolation between your query and the SQL database at least in the Altinity Grafana plugin for ClickHouse which is the main one I use. reply xtracto 9 hours agorootparentprevI had the same experience. Featurewise Superset looked better, but after wasting a couple of hours trying to install it, I just gave up. Instead I installed Metabase in 5 minutes tops: spin ec2 instance, whether and java -jar . I've never looked back. The only thing that turns me off I'd that it's implemented in an obscure language. At one time I wanted to add some custom postprocessing to an api (given an sql query, get some python/pandas postproc command from a sql comment and execute it in the returned table), but the used language is just not for me (some lisp dialect) reply NoThisIsMe 5 hours agorootparentClojure is not particularly obscure reply fuzztester 14 hours agorootparentprevI just took a look at Metabase. https://www.metabase.com/demo Demo is nice. reply c0brac0bra 12 hours agorootparentprevYep, we've really liked Metabase for embedding in our platform. reply staticautomatic 17 hours agoparentprevLet’s be honest, intuitive is the last word we’d use to describe most Apache projects. reply pseudosavant 13 hours agorootparentThey are doing pretty well that it is even clear what the project is really even about. Good luck figuring that out within 30 seconds of hitting the average Apache project homepage. reply slyall 12 hours agorootparentThere seem to be dozens of Apache \"Big Data\" projects that all look kinda the same unless you are a Big Data person. reply dzamo_norton 6 hours agorootparentEven if you are a data person. The ASF doesn't mind overlap between projects [1], it spreads its bets and lets the market choose the winners. 1. https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/#incubator reply mritchie712 10 hours agoparentprevHad a similar experience with Superset. A few others have mentioned Metabase and I agree it's better, but if you're looking for a different approach to data, check out Definite (https://www.definite.app/). It's a \"data stack in a box\". A few things we're doing differently: 1. Built-in data warehouse - We spin up a duckdb database for you to load data to 2. 500+ connectors - You don't need to buy a separate ETL and you can pull in all your data (e.g. Postgres, Stripe, HubSpot, Zendesk, etc.) automatically 3. Semantic layer - Define dimensions, measures, and joins in one place. We have pre-built models for all the sources we support (e.g. the Stripe model already has measures for MRR, churn, etc.) 4. Simple BI - Build a table with the data you want and generate visuals off that table I'm mike@definite.app if you have any questions. reply codeduck 17 hours agoparentprevI've just been playing with superset. I'd have to agree. Things which are easy in SQL are... disturbingly hard or nonobvious in superset. And the documentation is sparse at best. reply FridgeSeal 13 hours agoparentprevIt wasn’t fast either when I used it. What it was though, was riddled with dozens of Python runtime errors and innumerable glitches. Metabase is where it’s at. reply bushbaba 18 hours agoparentprevIt’s more intuitive than the open source alternatives but is not as intuitive as tableau and others. reply marcinzm 14 hours agorootparentMetabase is more intuitive. Also, being unintuitive isn't great but not the worst thing. A project not even realizing that (and thinking the exact opposite) is much much worse. Unintuitive can be fixed with PRs over time. Delusional project leadership cannot. reply atombender 15 hours agoparentprevAre there better alternatives? reply lf-non 1 hour agoprevFull fledged BI tools like Superset and Metabase are amazing for their intended use cases. But they may be an overkill if your primary use case is to infrequently build semi-interactive reports for non-technical end-users and your use cases are are mostly covered by standard graphs & tables. Esp. so if you are familiar with SQL and have access to the underlying data source. Two nifty utilities I have found to be very useful for latter kind of use cases are SQLPage and Evidence. They make it very convenient to whip out some SQL and convert that to a neat professional looking web ui that can be forwarded to an end user. In case of Evidence it is a statically generated site, and in case of SQLPage it is a web app that connects to a live database.

We also accept PRs and Issues if there are things bugging people, of course. It's always a balancing act between building some new feature that people are clamoring for, or fixing those cosmetic issues that always crop up. reply adamgamble 10 hours agoprevWe use metabase heavily at work. However where it seems like all these tools fall down is organization around the hundreds of dashboards and questions. I wish it had like a built wiki or something to build out more navigation. Anyone know of any good ways to do that? reply _pastel 7 hours agoparent100% agree. One thing that helps is hooking metabase up to its own database and building queries on your queries, e.g.: select * from report_card where dataset_query ilike '%' || {{query}} || '%' (You can also join in metadata like the author, when it was last ran, etc.) We also try really hard to keep the Collection directory structure clean and consistent. But it's still really hard. reply xtracto 8 hours agoparentprevMhmm this gives me an idea.. what if I could \"group\" metabase sql queries by \"similarity\" (either of results or of the query itself) Another option could be to use LLM to summarize, tag and group queries for better discoverability. reply amai 51 minutes agoprevDoes it have horizontal bar charts nowadays? reply adlpz 18 hours agoprevHas anyone tried both this and Metabase? I've used Metabase in a few projects and I find it very nice. This seems more powerful, perhaps? Is it worth it for BI on small datasets? reply CalRobert 17 hours agoparentYes, I am at a company using Metabase, but I have a decent amount of experience with Superset (albeit from many years ago). The reason we chose Metabase was that it had table joins, while Superset doesn't (unless it has added them since I used it). It also looks a bit sleeker. But I strongly prefer Superset; I found that with Metabase I had to turn a lot of things off to make it usable (Let me see \"the_table\" not \"The Table\"!), I was constantly annoyed at the opacity around models vs \"questions\", etc. and every time I wanted to change a question Metabase insisted on creating a new one instead. The real issue here was when we wanted to swap out the data source for a lot of questions but there was no clean way to do so without MB just creating new questions. Also, Metabase doesn't have serialization unless you pay them AND you self-host, (if I'm self hosting then what exactly am I paying for?) and that's pretty annoying. https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/installation-and-operat.... But it does let you join tables. Sometimes that's enough to make MB worth dealing with. reply rusackas 11 hours agorootparentSuperset lets you join tables within the same database. If you want to do cross-DB joins, we have a new (beta) in-memory meta-DB that lets you do this, but we generally see and recommend people using things like Trino for this. reply CalRobert 4 hours agorootparentNice! When was that added? reply Cilvic 9 hours agorootparentprevIs that new? Last time I checked this was the major downside from superset reply noduerme 17 hours agorootparentprevThe \"model\" vs \"question\" thing is really annoying as there's no real difference from the user's perspective, and it's easy to accidentally convert a model back to a question without noticing when you publish something. You notice when you try to drill into the chart. There's a lot of annoying manual labor in metabase, e.g. I want to filter something into 10 different charts and I need to duplicate it 10 times and change a filter on each one. Still yeah joins are nice. A non-bugged aggregate count/sum as a window function would be nicer. reply adlpz 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks! Very detailed answer. I've found the weird \"make it easy\" mindset a bit annoying with Metabase too. The whole questions, nice table names... I'll give Superset a try in my next project I think. reply itsoktocry 17 hours agorootparentprev>I was constantly annoyed at the opacity around models vs \"questions\" Yeah, somewhere along the line Metabase decided to get opinionated on \"self-serve\". I imagine it works well for some teams and companies, but for the tech-oriented, it's annoying. I prefer my BI tools to be platforms that make for easy charting and cross-filters, while I build and control the models behind the scenes with a tool like dbt. reply skadamat 17 hours agoparentprevMetabase is a bit more user-friendly to be honest than Superset. Superset has a WAY more liberal license, so it's ideal for people who want to customize Superset and build data apps. reply sokols 15 hours agoparentprevMetabase is great, I use it with a Oracle Database. reply Wilduck 14 hours agoprevIs Superset a decent tool if you're just a single person doing data analysis? Say I have a handful of sqlite databases, and just want to be able to develop some queries / charts. I was looking into Tableau / Power BI / Superset, and all of them seemed pretty heavyweight for a single user, and none of them seemed super easy to get setup locally. Any recommendations for a good piece of software for the single user case? Or a more convenient way to run the heavyweight tools? reply bigger_cheese 5 hours agoparentIf you are doing data analysis I don't think any of the 3 pieces of software you mentioned are going to be that helpful. I see these products as tools for data visualization and reporting i.e. presenting prepared datasets to users in a visually appealing way. They aren't as well suited for serious analytics. I can't comment on Superset or Tableau but I am familiar with Power BI (it has been rolled out across my org), the type of statistics you can do with it are fairly rudimentary. If you need to do any thing beyond summarizing (counts, averages, min, max etc). It is not particularly easy. For data analysis I use SAS or R. This software allows you do things like multivariate regression, timeseries forecasting, PCA, Cluster analysis etc. There is also plotting capability. Both these products are kind of old school, I've been using them since early 2000's, the \"new school\" seems to be Python. Pretty much all the recent data science people in my organization use Python. Particularly Pandas and libraries like Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/). The \"power\" users of Power BI in my organization tend to be finance/HR people for use cases like drill down into cost figures or Interactively presenting KPI's and other headline figures to management things like that. reply unixhero 14 hours agoparentprevTableau is the best, most powerful, most mature of the three, most feature complete and easiest of the three.

Superset is nice, easy to modify and extend but not user friendly as Redash or Metabase. But after the author launched Preset, it seems to have improved much with the company effort. It looks like to me the best way for OSS to advance is to have a company dedicated to improve it. reply nvrmnd 15 hours agoprevOne thing to keep in mind with BI software is that the users are often very different than, well, those individuals that prefer to use mutt as an email client. Many, or most, users for a BI tool will be operations, product managers, and business management who simply will not find the interface to be intuitive, responsive, or well designed. At least that's my experience. reply lars_francke 17 hours agoprevWe've built a Kubernetes Operator for Apache Superset at Stackable: https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/ It's part of our Open Source Data Platform and it's one of the few open source BI tools out there and there are not a lot of alternatives in this space.

The differentiation as I see it, is that Superset is designed to craft SQL queries and visualize the results. The query builder is probably where this shows the most. To make it more concrete -- coworkers tell me Grafana doesn't work so well with Apache Druid, while Superset supports it quite well. reply jldugger 11 hours agorootparent*dashboarding, yikes reply totalhack 8 hours agorootparentI thought this was some jargon I didn't know haha. reply skadamat 17 hours agoparentprevI love Grafana but Grafana doesn't really support non-time-series visualization that well. reply sgt 1 hour agorootparentWhy is that, though? I'd think that there'd be some plugins/extensions for Grafana that could do this. Grafana could then become the next PowerBI/Tableau/Superset killer eventually. reply bfung 17 hours agoparentprevgrafana is built more for operational and timeseries data, but not so optimal for complex analytical queries.

It was the only self-hosted tool I'd receive after-hours text messages about going down that someone urgently needed back up for some task due tomorrow. Business users loved the self-serve query builder, and it wasn't uncommon to walk around the office and see Metabase up on someones screen. My CEO absolutely loved it, and used it daily including to put together data for board decks. None of my users cared about visualizations, and lived in tabular data. This included finance, marketing, merchandising, operations, and executives (CEO/COO/CFO). The only people that lamented the limited visualization were analysts. Power users did all their day-to-day work in Excel or other tools anyway, such as managing marketing spend or inventory allocations. Metabase was great for dashboards and self-service (ad-hoc). 10/10 would deploy again. reply lars_francke 17 hours agoparentprev> almost everything I've ever worked with that was run by the Apache foundation turned out to be semi-abandoned disasterware over time Can you name a few examples? reply smaudet 17 hours agorootparentIvy, Netbeans, Open Office, Shiro, Solr all jump at me off this list: https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?name These are all projects that once were (more) relevant, however seem to have become rather niche (Gradle, Jetbrains/VSCode, GoogleDocs/Libreoffice e.g. for the first three are the dominant competitors). Most of these projects (like the massive commons listings) are either used by some Java library somewhere (meaning their success/relevance is tied to the usage of Java), or are obscure enough that they are no longer used widely and so suffer from lack of interest. There are gems in this list, to be sure, but if you just run into half-maintained projects all the time you're not likely to associate good things with the Apache name? reply bombcar 17 hours agorootparentprevHere's the list: https://projects.apache.org/projects.html?name OpenOffice is probably the most famous (it still has the name, but it is dead, LibreOffice is the real \"active\" fork). And the things in the \"Attic\" are officially dead - https://projects.apache.org/committee.html?attic and many more projects should be there. reply lars_francke 16 hours agorootparentI think it's a great feature to have explicit lifecycle for open source projects. Lots of other projects just die silently and/or you are unsure of the status. Here you at least have a chance to revive them if you like as there is always an overarching organisation. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentThe problem really is that some Apache projects are actually alive (Apache itself, apparently Superset, Groovy, etc) and some appear alive at first glance. More things should move into the Attic, like OpenOffice. reply noduerme 17 hours agorootparentprevWell, OpenOffice as I said. Cordova is/was a hot mess (with some nice pioneering features, just really not well maintained imo and felt like quicksand to build even a small app on) Then the sort of long slow death of Flex (now Royale?) Apache seems like where software no one loves anymore goes to die. reply rpeden 17 hours agorootparentI suppose it depends on projects you're using. For many developers their primary exposure to the Apache Foundation is through projects like Maven and Kafka, and those certainly don't feel dead. reply renewiltord 15 hours agoparentprevApache Software Foundation is just an umbrella organization to keep things on life support till someone can apply sufficient motive force to resurrect.

    "title": "Introducing Mistral Large: Advanced Multilingual Language Model",
    "originLink": "https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large/",
    "originBody": "February 26, 2024 Mistral AI team We are releasing Mistral Large, our latest and most advanced language model. Mistral Large is available through la Plateforme. We are also making it available through Azure, our first distribution partner. Mistral Large, our new flagship model Mistral Large is our new cutting-edge text generation model. It reaches top-tier reasoning capabilities. It can be used for complex multilingual reasoning tasks, including text understanding, transformation, and code generation. Mistral Large achieves strong results on commonly used benchmarks, making it the world's second-ranked model generally available through an API (next to GPT-4) [see below for details on benchmarks]. Figure 1: Comparison of GPT-4, Mistral Large (pre-trained), Claude 2, Gemini Pro 1.0, GPT 3.5 and LLaMA 2 70B on MMLU (Measuring massive multitask language understanding). Mistral Large comes with new capabilities and strengths: It is natively fluent in English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian, with a nuanced understanding of grammar and cultural context. Its 32K tokens context window allows precise information recall from large documents. Its precise instruction-following enables developers to design their moderation policies – we used it to set up the system-level moderation of le Chat. It is natively capable of function calling. This, along with constrained output mode, implemented on la Plateforme, enables application development and tech stack modernisation at scale. Partnering with Microsoft to provide our models on Azure At Mistral, our mission is to make frontier AI ubiquitous. This is why we’re announcing today that we’re bringing our open and commercial models to Azure. Microsoft’s trust in our model is a step forward in our journey! Our models are now available through: La Plateforme: safely hosted on Mistral’s infrastructure in Europe, this access point enables developers to create applications and services across our comprehensive range of models. Azure: Mistral Large is available through Azure AI Studio and Azure Machine Learning, with as seamless a user experience as our APIs. Beta customers have used it with significant success. Self-deployment: our models can be deployed on your environment for the most sensitive use cases with access to our model weights; Read success stories on this kind of deployment, and contact our team for further details. Mistral Large capacities We compare Mistral Large's performance to the top-leading LLM models on commonly used benchmarks. Reasoning and knowledge Mistral Large shows powerful reasoning capabilities. In the following figure, we report the performance of the pretrained models on standard benchmarks. Figure 2: Performance on widespread common sense, reasoning and knowledge benchmarks of the top-leading LLM models on the market: MMLU (Measuring massive multitask language in understanding), HellaSwag (10-shot), Wino Grande (5-shot), Arc Challenge (5-shot), Arc Challenge (25-shot), TriviaQA (5-shot) and TruthfulQA. Multi-lingual capacities Mistral Large has native multi-lingual capacities. It strongly outperforms LLaMA 2 70B on HellaSwag, Arc Challenge and MMLU benchmarks in French, German, Spanish and Italian. Figure 3: Comparison of Mistral Large, Mixtral 8x7B and LLaMA 2 70B on HellaSwag, Arc Challenge and MMLU in French, German, Spanish and Italian. Maths & Coding Mistral Large shows top performance in coding and math tasks. In the table below, we report the performance across a suite of popular benchmarks to evaluate the coding and math performance for some of the top-leading LLM models. Figure 4: Performance on popular coding and math benchmarks of the leading LLM models on the market: HumanEval pass@1, MBPP pass@1, Math maj@4, GSM8K maj@8 (8-shot) and GSM8K maj@1 (5 shot). A new Mistral Small, optimised for low latency workloads Alongside Mistral Large, we’re releasing a new optimised model, Mistral Small, optimised for latency and cost. Mistral Small outperforms Mixtral 8x7B and has lower latency, which makes it a refined intermediary solution between our open-weight offering and our flagship model. Mistral Small benefits from the same innovation as Mistral Large regarding RAG-enablement and function calling. We’re simplifying our endpoint offering to provide the following: Open-weight endpoints with competitive pricing. This comprises open-mistral-7B and open-mixtral-8x7b. New optimised model endpoints, mistral-small-2402 and mistral-large-2402. We’re maintaining mistral-medium, which we are not updating today. Our benchmarks give a comprehensive view of performance/cost tradeoffs. Beyond the new model offering, we’re allowing organisation management multi-currency pricing and have updated service tiers on la Plateforme. We have also made a lot of progress in reducing the latency of all our endpoints. JSON format and function calling JSON format mode forces the language model output to be valid JSON. This functionality enables developers to interact with our models more naturally to extract information in a structured format that can be easily used in the remainder of their pipelines. Function calling lets developers interface Mistral endpoints with a set of their own tools, enabling more complex interactions with internal code, APIs or databases. You will learn more in our function calling guide. Function calling and JSON format are only available on mistral-small and mistral-large. We will be adding formatting to all endpoints shortly, as well as enabling more fine-grained format definitions. Try Mistral Large and Mistral Small today Mistral Large is available on La Plateforme and Azure as of today. Mistral Large is also exposed on our beta assistant demonstrator, le Chat. As always, we’re eager to have your feedback!",

Synthetic benchmarks aren't a perfect representation of anything. reply maleldil 48 minutes agorootparentI think they're close enough that it depends on your use case. IME, which is mostly generating Python and shell code, Gemini Advanced is faster, less lazy and generates overall better solutions than GPT-4. It also seems to be more up-to-date with libraries and stuff. It can also directly go to URLs (e.g. summarise a paper), which GPT-4 refuses to do. reply Nidhug 12 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't MMLU have like 2-3% wrong answers anyways ? reply cyrusradfar 17 hours agorootparentprev1.5 was probably released too late to be tested. reply vy007vikas 16 hours agorootparentBut Ultra 1.0 is available to compare against, right? reply mewpmewp2 11 hours agorootparentHow can I get access to it?

I asked a couple git and python questions and it answered it about the same as GPT-4 Turbo (or whatever ChatGPT uses nowadays). The answer was slightly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo in the sense there was a lot of fluff in the GPT-3.5 Turbo's answer. reply pseudosavant 15 hours agorootparentprevI haven't tried this model yet (they seem to be under high load). Mistral's previous top model (Mixtral 8x7B) wasn't quite as good as GPT-4, but it seemed close. Clearly way better than GPT 3.5. Many Mixtral responses were better than the GPT-4 ones. reply Takennickname 16 hours agorootparentprevI tried it. Seems fine. What prompts gave you nonsense? reply breadwinner 10 hours agorootparentI tried what Google would call \"long tail\" queries. Chat GPT-4 gave me accurate answers, but Mistral gave me nonsensical answers. I can't share the exact prompts because they are personally identifying. reply a_vanderbilt 16 hours agorootparentprevWhich size model are you using? Large isn't terribly good, but Next is alright. It's not close at all to GPT-4, but I can see some use cases I'd try it for (and will be). reply d-z-m 18 hours agoprevVery nice! I know they've already done a lot, but I would've liked some language in there re-affirming a commitment to contributing to the open source community. I had thought that was a major part of their brand. I've been staying tuned[0] since the miqu[1] debacle thinking that more open weights were on the horizon. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

Basically, I don't believe the OSS for super large model will benefit the OSS, instead of just for copy-cat. reply WiSaGaN 18 hours agoprevChangelog is also updated: [1] Feb. 26, 2024 API endpoints: We renamed 3 API endpoints and added 2 model endpoints. open-mistral-7b (aka mistral-tiny-2312): renamed from mistral-tiny. The endpoint mistral-tiny will be deprecated in three months. open-mixtral-8x7B (aka mistral-small-2312): renamed from mistral-small. The endpoint mistral-small will be deprecated in three months. mistral-small-latest (aka mistral-small-2402): new model. mistral-medium-latest (aka mistral-medium-2312): old model. The previous mistral-medium has been dated and tagged as mistral-medium-2312. The endpoint mistral-medium will be deprecated in three months. mistral-large-latest (aka mistral-large-2402): our new flagship model with leading performance. New API capabilities: Function calling: available for Mistral Small and Mistral Large. JSON mode: available for Mistral Small and Mistral Large La Plateforme: We added multiple currency support to the payment system, including the option to pay in US dollars. We introduced enterprise platform features including admin management, which allows users to manage individuals from your organization. Le Chat: We introduced the brand new chat interface Le Chat to easily interact with Mistral models. You can currently interact with three models: Mistral Large, Mistral Next, and Mistral Small. [1]: https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/changelog/ reply tempusalaria 18 hours agoparentThe change in endpoint name is a strong suggestion that there will be few if any open models going forwards from mistral. It’s a clear move towards the default being closed. Disappointing but I guess unsurprising. reply Terretta 18 hours agorootparent> change in endpoint name is a strong suggestion that there will be few if any open models going forwards From deeper in the page, unclear whether this confirms your point: We’re simplifying our endpoint offering to provide the following: - Open-weight endpoints with competitive pricing. This comprises open-mistral-7B and open-mixtral-8x7b. - New optimised model endpoints, mistral-small-2402 and mistral-large-2402. We’re maintaining mistral-medium, which we are not updating today. reply declaredapple 15 hours agorootparentprev> The change in endpoint name is a strong suggestion I don't think the naming really suggests that. The new naming suggests they'll have two sets, the \"open\" models and their commercial ones. I do agree with your skepticism though. I kinda expected them to release something, likely an older model. Currently the closest is \"miqu\" which was a leak of a early quantized \"medium\". reply cuckatoo 17 hours agorootparentprevMaybe a requirement set by MSFT in their latest \"partnership\" reply arnaudsm 18 hours agoparentprevI know marketing folks prefer poetic names, but I wish we had consistent naming like v1.0, 2.0 etc, instead of renaming your product line every year like Apple and Xbox does. Confusing and opaque. reply ethbr1 18 hours agorootparentAmazon's jungle convinced me there's two valid solutions to string naming. 1: Trying to design and impose an ontology, echo that in naming, and then keep it coherent in perpetuity. 2: Accept that definition cannot be solved at the naming level, expect people to read the docs to dereference names, and name it whatever the hell you want. Honestly, as long as they don't suddenly repurpose names, I have no problem with either approach. They both have their pros and cons. PS: And jungle does have the benefit of keeping developers from making assumptions about stringN+1 in the future... reply kergonath 11 hours agorootparentprev> renaming your product line every year like Apple and Xbox does. Apple is famous for not updating product names. This year’s MacBook Pro is just “MacBook Pro”, same as last year’s, and so on since the beginning. You have to dig to get actual names like “M3, nov 2023” or the less ambiguous Mac15,3. That said, I agree with you. Navigating the jungle of LLMs all over the place with utterly stupid naming schemes is not easy. reply r00fus 15 hours agorootparentprevApple does it properly - version + moniker. Searching google/etc for specific issues related to version numbers alone is a disaster, so monikers have a use. reply lunyaskye 15 hours agorootparentI used to work for them, and I agree. It seems confusing from the outside but internally they maintain a pretty consistent system. Many third party partners don't follow this system properly, in my experience. reply OkGoDoIt 11 hours agorootparentprevReally? Other than the iPhone and Apple Watch which do have clear series naming, I find it basically impossible to determine if any particular Apple product name is the latest version or several years old. The iPads especially, and the MacBooks were pretty confusing until recently. The Apple TV and AirPods are also a bit of a mess. I wish they would just do for all of their products what they do for the iPhone, it would make things so much simpler. But even then, the iPhones are not clearly labeled on the products themselves. If someone hands you a random iPhone, it’s impossible to tell what model is unless you have encyclopedic knowledge of the exact differences between all the different iPhones, or you have the unlock passcode and can get into the settings>about menu. reply simonw 17 hours agoprevI just added support for the new models to my https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral plugin for my LLM CLI tool. You can now do this: pipx install llm llm install llm-mistral llm keys set mistralllm -m mistral-large 'prompt goes here' reply ComputerGuru 17 hours agoparentdoes `llm install llm-mistral` also upgrade if already installed? reply simonw 17 hours agorootparentYou can upgrade the plugin like this: llm install -U llm-mistral Relevant issue when I thought this didn't work: https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/427 reply city17 18 hours agoprevJust tried Le Chat for some coding issues I had today that ChatGPT (with GPT-4) wasn't able to solve, and Le Chat actually gave way better answers. Not sure if ChatGPT quality has gone down to save costs as some people suggest, but for these few problems the quality of the answers was significantly better for Mistral. reply qwertox 10 hours agoparentI just did a 1:1 copy of some of my ChatGPT chats with Mistral Large (always posting the same questions), and while it is really, really good, it's still not as good as GPT4. I feel like ChatGPT has a better way of figuring out what I want to know and provides better examples. I also preferred GPT4's code. Then Le Chat has some usability issues, like a too thin font and a too high contrast in dark mode. But overall, I could live with it should ChatGPT go offline. reply lobocinza 8 hours agoparentprevI might as well be hallucinating but my personal experience is that GPT-4 got sucessively worse than what it was at launch date at least for general things. Nowadays it just refuse to answer a lot of things and lost the ability to do holistic \"reasoning\" (bridging knowledge from different areas). reply syntaxing 19 hours agoprevInteresting, I didn’t know they had le chat. I’ve been wanting a chatgpt competitor with mistral. Also love the fact they put “le” in front of their products reply loudmax 18 hours agoparentCute, but \"le chat\" literally means \"the cat\". I presume most young Francophones who are likely to actually use Mistral will pronounce it in Franglais as \"le tchatte\". reply mtremsal 18 hours agorootparentIn the top-left corner, when using dark mode, they call it \"le chat noir\", i.e. the black cat. :) reply samstave 17 hours agorootparentThey must have changed something in the matrix. reply not_a_dane 12 hours agorootparentthe simulation is broken. reply sekai 16 hours agorootparentprev> I presume most young Francophones who are likely to actually use Mistral will pronounce it in Franglais as \"le tchatte\" Anything's better than hearing how french pronounce ChatGPT: \"tchat j'ai pété\" (literally means \"cat, I farted\" in french). reply schrijver 11 hours agorootparentUhm, no ? Chat as in cat is pronounced sja. Or sjaht for a female cat (chatte). The tsjaht pronounciation is when using the english word chat in french. reply generalizations 18 hours agorootparentprevThey also used the phrase \"La Plateforme\" so it seems likely they may be going for the english word \"chat\". Though I haven't tried 'le chat' so idk if they have a cat mascot there or something. reply jakeinspace 18 hours agorootparentPlateforme (plate-forme) is semi-accepted French, it’s an anglicisme. reply dadoum 14 hours agorootparentis it? I always thought that it was just the corrected spelling (a lot of composite words have been merged together in a spelling reform in 1990), and that the English word was actually borrowed from French. reply jakeinspace 13 hours agorootparentHa, apparently I’m the uneducated one. I’d assumed it was an anglicisme that happened to work nicely, but it came to English from Middle French. However, the modern tech-related usage certainly first showed up in English, and then was upstreamed to French I assume? That’s kind of amusing… I’ll leave this as a testament to my hubris as a non-native French speaker. reply cfn 18 hours agorootparentprevI literally thought it was their mascot or something and ignored it. reply baq 18 hours agorootparentprevCould’ve gone with le coq… reply ot 18 hours agoparentprev\"Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac\" reply aatd86 11 hours agorootparentOnly if you know Big Mac personally otherwise it's \"Un Big Mac\" :oD reply aatd86 9 hours agorootparentThat's how I call the current French president btw...

GPT-4 Turbo is priced $10/M Input Tokens and $30/M Output Tokens. reply breakingcups 16 hours agoprevSo, all this hubbub about open weights is already over? It will remain closed? reply bicepjai 17 hours agoprevWhy is there no information about size of parameters anywhere ? Was that intentional or am I missing something reply Larok00 19 hours agoprevThere is not a lot of advantage to releasing this on Azure where you are directly competing with GPT-4, which will beat you on most tasks. reply hobofan 19 hours agoparentI would assume that the advantage (for Mistal) here is Microsoft paying them money to be the exclusive model hosting partner, so that everyone has to go to Azure to get top-tier hosted models. reply jsnell 18 hours agorootparentIt's obviously not exclusive (it's available hosted from both Mistral themselves and Azure). I guess it could possibly be exclusive within some smaller scope, but nothing in the article suggests that. Azure is described as the \"first distribution partner\", not an exclusive one. reply ZeroCool2u 18 hours agorootparentHosting by Mistral/OpenAI/Startup is often a non-starter for the larger enterprise style customers. For example, they have a legal agreement with Azure/GCP/AWS already and if they can say it's \"just another Cloud provider service\" it's stupid how much easier that makes things. Plus, you get stuff like FEDRAMP Moderate just for having your request sent to Azure/GCP/AWS instead? Enormous value. Getting any service, but especially a startup and one that ingests arbitrary information, to be FEDRAMP certified is the bureaucratic equivalent of inhaling a candy bar. reply ethbr1 18 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. Self-certification imposes non-negligible and recurring (recertification) costs to a business. And when you're industry-agnostic, you have to play whack-a-mole with whatever the chosen industry wants (e.g. HIPAA/HITRUST, FEDRAMP, etc.). Additionally, indemnification clauses and contractual negotiation of same can be a minefield. \"You assume all the risk, for any breach, even if it's our fault, with unlimited liability\" is every customer's preference. Small companies have neither the cash reserves to survive an (unlikely) claim nor the clout to push back on bad terms with a big customer. Microsoft et al. do. reply vitorgrs 10 hours agorootparentprevYes, just like you can get GPT on OpenAI API too. But that's it. You can't get GPT on AWS or any other cloud provider, just like it seems it won't be possible to get mistral closed models on any other cloud providers either. reply btbuildem 18 hours agoparentprevAu contraire, I think in the eyes of beige khaki corpo bureaucrats this gives Mixtral legitimacy and puts it on par with OpenAI offerings. MS putting their Azure stamp on this means it's Safe and Secure (tm).

This is stereotypical Gell-Mann amnesia - you have to validate information, for yourself, within your own model of the world. You need the tools to be able to verify information that's important to you, whether it's research or knowing which experts or sources are likely to be trustworthy. With AI video and audio on the horizon, you're left with having to determine for yourself whether to trust any given piece of media, and the only thing you'll know for sure is your own experience of events in the real world. That doesn't mean you need to discard all information online as untrustworthy. It just means we're going to need better tools and webs of trust based on repeated good-faith interactions. It's likely I can trust that information posted by individuals on HN will be of a higher quality than the comments section in YouTube or some random newspaper site. I don't need more than a superficial confirmation that information provided here is true - but if it's important, then I will want corroboration from many sources, with validation by an expert extant human. There's no downside in trusting the information you're provided by AI just as much as any piece of information provided by a human, if you're reasonable about it. Right now is as bad as they'll ever be, and all sorts of development is going in to making them more reliable, factual, and verifiable, with appropriately sourced validation. Based on my own knowledge of ginseng and a superficial verification of what that site says, it's more or less as correct as any copy produced by a human copy writer would be. It tracks with wikipedia and numerous other sources. All that said, however, I think the killer app for AI will be e-butlers that interface with content for us, extracting meaningful information, identifying biases, ulterior motives, political and commercial influences, providing background research, and local indexing so that we can offload much of the uncertainty and work required to sift the content we want from the SEO boilerplate garbage pit that is the internet. reply tmpz22 14 hours agorootparent> This is stereotypical Gell-Mann amnesia - you have to validate information, for yourself, within your own model of the world. You need the tools to be able to verify information that's important to you, whether it's research or knowing which experts or sources are likely to be trustworthy. Except anthropologically speaking we still live in trust-based society. We trust water to be available. We trust the grocery stores to be stocked. We trust that our Government institutions are always going to be there. All this to say we have a moral obligation not to let AI spam off the hook as \"trust but verify\". It is fucked up that people make money abusing innate trust-based mechanism that society depends on to be society. reply observationist 11 hours agorootparentOh, for sure - I'm not saying don't do anything about it. I'm just saying you should have been treating all information online like this anyway. The lesson from Gell-Mann is that you should bring the same level of skepticism to bear on any source of information that you would on an article where you have expertise and can identify bad information, sloppy thinking, or other significant problems you're particularly qualified to spot. The mistake was ever not using \"Trust but verify\" as the default mode. AI is just scaling the problem up, but then again, millions of bots online and troll farms aren't exactly new, either. So yes, don't let AI off the hook, but also, if AI is used to good purposes, with repeatable positive results, then don't dismiss something merely because AI is being used. AI being involved in the pipeline isn't a good proxy for quality or authenticity, and AI is only going to get better than it is now. reply satellite2 14 hours agorootparentprevAnd most importantly we trust money to not only be paper or bits reply pseudosavant 15 hours agorootparentprevTo be clear, information on the internet has always been assumed unreliable.

With enough digging into names/phrases you can backtrack to the source. LLMs trained on these sources are gonna have the same biases inherently. This is before considering the idea that the people training these things could just obfuscate a particularly biased node and claim innocence. reply antisthenes 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a binary reliable/unreliable. AI just introduces another layer of mistrust to a system with a lot of perverse incentives. In other words, if the information was also unreliable in the past, it doesn't mean it can't get much worse in the future. At some point, even experts will be overwhelmed with the amount of data to sift through, because the generated data is going to be optimized for \"looking\" correct, not \"being\" correct. reply glfharris 14 hours agorootparentprevI was thinking the exact same thing last month[1]! It's really interesting what the implications of this might be, and how valuable human-derived content might become. There's still this idea of model collapse, whereby the output of LLMs trained repeatedly on artificial content descends into what we think is gibberish, so however realistic ChatGPT appears, there are still significant differences between its writing and ours.

So many companies have been founded around premium versions of open-source products. It's good that they've even given us as much as they have. They have to make the economics work somehow. reply therealpygon 17 hours agorootparentIt’s a significant problem when “Open Source” is used as an enticement to convince people to work on and improve their product for free, especially when that product inevitably relicenses that work using a sham of a “rewriting” process to claim ownership as though it voids all the volunteer’s efforts that went into design, debug, and other changes, just so that source can be switched to a proprietary license to make the product more VC/IPO friendly. And all of that cuts the knees out of the companies you claim it created in order to capture a portion of their profits despite the fact that they most likely contributed to the popularity and potentially even the development, and therefore success, of said “Open Source”. IMO, it is just a new version of wage/code theft with a “public good” side-story to convince the gullible that it is somehow “better” and “fair”, when everyone involved were making money, just not as much money as they could be taking with a little bit of court-supported code theft and a hand-waive of “volunteerism”. reply pradn 14 hours agorootparentThe people who use these open models are doing it because they find them useful. That's already plenty of benefit for them. The \"ecosystem play\" of benefiting from volunteers' mods to open models is certainly a benefit for the model trainer. This fact doesn't eliminate the benefit of people being able to use good models. reply michaelt 18 hours agorootparentprevIt's not a problem from a moral perspective or anything - we all know these models are very expensive to create. However, from a marketing perspective - think of who the users of an open model are. They're people who, for one reason or another, don't want to use OpenAI's APIs. When selling a hosted API to a group predominantly comprised of people who reject hosted APIs - you've got to expect some push back. reply jasonjmcghee 18 hours agorootparentIs this true? I know a whole lot of people that use and fine tune Mistral / variants and they all use OpenAI too. (For other projects or for ChatGPT) From my perspective, I want to use the best model. But maybe as models improve and for certain use cases that will start to change. If I work on a project that has certain parts that are fulfilled by Mistral and can reduce cost, that's cool.

But I guess I'm hearing you say now, a key point was- the attractive part about Mistral was the open model aspect. But it's difficult to pay expenses and wages if you can't charge money. Re: fine tuning- hard for me to believe they won't add it eventually. reply behnamoh 18 hours agorootparentprevThis. Also, at least be upfront with users about motives. OpenAI stopped claiming to be \"open\" about 2-3 years ago. That's fine—at least I know they're not pro-OSS.

It annoys me that people fall for these marketing tactics and keep promoting and advertising the product for free.

Being closed is not fraud, coercion, theft, dishonest, anti-competitive, … (On the other hand, being open, in situations where closed would be more profitable, is taking the moral high ground. Open provides better value for the customer, user, and community.) Aside from moralizing, the economic puzzle is: How to align the economic incentives of businesses with the real long term community value of openness.

The problem was, there was no formal legal restrictions put in place at the start that stopped them from hatching a private subsidiary or not remaining open. Just that the initial organization was non-profit and for AI safety. Which is the only way that could have been stopped. A failure of initial oversight. A lack of “alignment” one might say. reply dkjaudyeqooe 11 hours agorootparent> Those initial OpenAI donations really were for open development.

    "title": "Discovering AWS Account ID of S3 Buckets Using VPC Endpoint Policies",
    "originLink": "https://tracebit.com/blog/2024/02/finding-aws-account-id-of-any-s3-bucket/",
    "originBody": "Sam Cox CTO & Co-Founder Thu, February 22, 2024 How to find the AWS Account ID of any S3 Bucket In 2021 Ben Bridts published a highly inventive method for finding the AWS Account ID of a public S3 bucket. This post describes a technique to find the Account ID of any S3 bucket (both private and public). I'd highly recommend reading Ben's technique first as we will re-use a lot of concepts. S3 Bucket to AWS Account ID Shell output can be worth a thousand words, here's what our technique enables - finding the previously unknown AWS Account ID for the bucket bucket-alpha: sh-5.2$ python3 find-s3-account.py bucket-alpha VPC endpoint vpce-0e76855aadb0dafb5 policy already configured Requesting bucket-alpha using session name 0----------- Requesting bucket-alpha using session name 1----------- Requesting bucket-alpha using session name 2----------- Requesting bucket-alpha using session name 3----------- SNIP Requesting bucket-alpha using session name -----------7 Requesting bucket-alpha using session name -----------8 Requesting bucket-alpha using session name -----------9 Finding session names which passed the VPC endpoint in CloudTrail...

When exploring possibilities for this technique, I started by breaking down exactly why Ben's method works. There are three key elements which combine to make it work: The ability to apply an IAM policy to the request In the Ben's technique, this is achieved by applying a custom policy when assuming the role. The ability to infer whether this IAM policy permitted the request or not In the case of public buckets, this is quite simple. If our policy blocked the request, the request will fail with AccessDenied. Otherwise, the request will succeed as expected with requests to public buckets. The ability to apply a wildcard match on the s3:ResourceAccount condition key This allows us to discover the Account ID incrementally, one digit at a time, reducing the search space from trillions to hundreds. A solution After exploring a few different ideas, I found a solution which works. It involves using a VPC Endpoint for S3, and a difference of behaviour in CloudTrail when a request is denied by a VPC Endpoint policy. The ability to apply an IAM policy to the request Creating a VPC Endpoint of type \"Interface\" for S3 will allow us to apply an IAM policy to the request. This policy intersects with the other policies which apply to the request (e.g. the bucket policy, the IAM policy of the principal making the request etc) when the request is made through the VPC Endpoint. The ability to infer whether this IAM policy permitted the request or not As the target bucket is owned by a third party and is a private bucket, we're (thankfully) going to receive an AccessDenied response, regardless of whichever policies we apply to the request. However, we can infer whether the VPC Endpoint policy blocked or permitted the request by whether it appears in our own CloudTrail logs. If the request does appear in our CloudTrail logs, it was permitted by our VPC Endpoint policy but blocked as expected by the bucket policy. If the request does not appear in our CloudTrail logs, it was blocked by our VPC Endpoint policy. The ability to apply a wildcard match on the s3:ResourceAccount condition key We can use the full power of IAM policy conditions, including StringLike wildcards and resource condition keys in a VPC Endpoint policy, so the same basic technique will work here. Step-by-step Let's say that we want to find the Account ID of the bucket bucket-alpha. Note that some of our activities here will be visible to the owner of the bucket in their own CloudTrail logs. Determine the bucket region We need to find the region in which the bucket lives so that we can create a VPC in the same region. This can be done by curling the bucket's HTTP endpoint and examining the x-amz-bucket-region header (which is returned despite the request being forbidden). curl -v bucket-alpha.s3.amazonaws.com ... x-amz-bucket-region: us-east-1 Deploy a VPC and VPC Endpoint in the same region We need to deploy a VPC and a VPC Endpoint for S3 in the same region as the target bucket. It's best to create a VPC specifically for this purpose as our VPC Endpoint will interfere with requests to S3 from the VPC. The VPC Endpoint should be of type \"Interface\" so we can apply a policy to the request. Launch an EC2 instance within the VPC and confirm that it's using the VPC Endpoint for S3 We'll need to send requests to S3 from within the VPC so that the VPC Endpoint is used. An EC2 instance is a convenient way of doing so. Modify the VPC Endpoint policy to determine whether the account ID of the target bucket starts with \"0\" Apply a policy to the VPC Endpoint which performs a wildcard match on the s3:ResourceAccount condition key. This will only permit requests through the endpoint if the bucket's Account ID starts with \"0\". { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"s3:*\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"s3:ResourceAccount\": \"0*\" } } } ] } Make a request to the target bucket Via the EC2 instance, make a request to the target bucket. This request will be denied as expected. It's best to use a \"Management\" request rather than a \"Data\" request so we don't need to do anything special with our CloudTrail setup. In this case I used GetBucketAcl. aws s3api get-bucket-acl --bucket bucket-alpha An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetBucketAcl operation: Access Denied Check whether the request appears in CloudTrail Now we want to check whether our request appears in CloudTrail. aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=GetBucketAcl --start-time $(date -d \"-10 minutes\" +%s) If we find our request in CloudTrail, it means that the VPC Endpoint policy permitted the request - i.e. the Account ID of the bucket starts with 0. If we don't find the request, then the VPC Endpoint policy blocked the request - i.e. the Account ID of the bucket does not start with 0. {\"eventSource\": \"s3.amazonaws.com\", \"eventName\": \"GetBucketAcl\", \"resources\": [ { \"accountId\": \"HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS\", \"type\": \"AWS::S3::Bucket\", \"ARN\": \"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-alpha\" } ], \"vpcEndpointId\": \"vpce-0e76855aadb0dafb5\", } Bear in mind that it will take a few minutes for the request to appear in CloudTrail. To be safe, I'd recommend waiting a 10 minutes before deciding the event won't appear in CloudTrail. Rinse and repeat Depending on the result of the previous step, modify the VPC Endpoint policy to discover more information about the account ID. For instance, if the event didn't appear in CloudTrail, modify the condition to test whether the first digit is 1: \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"s3:ResourceAccount\": \"1*\" } } If it did appear in CloudTrail (so the first digit of the account ID is 0), we can start work on the second digit: \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"s3:ResourceAccount\": \"00*\" } } Bear it mind, it takes a few minutes for policy changes to fully propagate and take effect. I've found waiting 5 minutes after modifying the policy to work well. Results I wrote a script to automate this process and it could reliably find the Account ID of a bucket. As it's quite a slow process, I used a slightly modified technique of performing a binary search on each digit so fewer tests were needed, e.g: \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"s3:ResourceAccount\": [\"0*\", \"1*\", \"2*\", \"3*\", \"4*\"] } } Leaving it for a few hours returned the account ID successfully: [ssm-user@ip-172-31-8-184 ~]$ python3 find-s3-account.py bucket-alpha Searching for bucket bucket-alpha Modifying VPC endpoint policy...

Even using a binary search, it will take approximately (40 * 12 minutes = 8 hours) to find the Account ID. To make this process faster, and eliminate the need to wait between each step, I modified the VPC endpoint policy like so: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:*\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"aws:userid\": \"*:0-----------\", \"s3:ResourceAccount\": \"0???????????\" } } }, { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:*\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"aws:userid\": \"*:1-----------\", \"s3:ResourceAccount\": \"1???????????\" } } }, SNIP { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"s3:*\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\", \"Principal\": \"*\", \"Condition\": { \"StringLike\": { \"aws:userid\": \"*:-----------9\", \"s3:ResourceAccount\": \"???????????9\" } } } ] } There are 120 statements in the policy - one for each possible digit in each possible position. The condition on aws:userid is used to match particular values of the RoleSessionName parameter (which we can freely specify) used in an STS AssumeRole call. In effect this means we can selectively choose which policy statement (i.e. a particular digit in a particular position) we want to test for each request, by assuming a role with a particular RoleSessionName before doing so.

There has already been a lot of interesting discussion about whether AWS account IDs should be considered sensitive. It's noteworthy that in the CloudTrail events themselves, AWS have chosen to leave the third-party account ID HIDDEN_DUE_TO_SECURITY_REASONS. You've probably also spotted that I've chosen to redact my own account ID from the examples in this post! This technique should also work to uncover other resource condition keys (e.g. aws:ResourceOrgID, aws:ResourceOrgPaths, aws:ResourceTag) associated with the bucket - or indeed for services other than S3 to which this technique could be applied It's possible that by creating mutually peered VPCs and VPC Endpoints in all regions you could create a setup which works regardless of the particular region of the target bucket. These techniques are only feasible due to the ability to use StringLike conditions against s3:ResourceAccount in a policy. I can't think of a use case where a partial match against a randomly-generated identifier is necessary. It seems like it might otherwise be beneficial for events which are denied by a VPC Endpoint policies to be logged in CloudTrail. Acknowledgments Ben Bridt's original technique inspired this work. I'm very grateful to Chris Farris for his invaluable help and advice. Thanks for reading this far, we hope you got something from this article.

Doing glob matching on account IDs is like doing concatenation with guids, applying a bitshift to a UTF8 string, or running a regex on an integer. It is a nonsensical operation, and - as shown here - results in surprising security properties of the resulting system.

I am unable to conceive of a use case for pattern matching account IDs. reply twoodfin 15 hours agorootparentIf for some reason you’re dealing with thousands of accounts that are architecturally indistinguishable, bucketing them by ID prefix isn’t a particularly wild thing to want to do. reply efitz 12 hours agorootparentAWS assigns these individually, and customers can’t influence the ID that they get. For access control purposes I see no valid use case for wildcards there. Sharding on account ID might make sense if someone has a large number of them, but that would not necessitate wildcard matching. reply OJFord 7 hours agorootparentBut it could seem like a neat and obvious way to reduce policy size (which is limited) and make it arguably more readable, or at least the intention clearer. (I might assume `2847373847261`, `37385857721`, `5847262671`, ... is `*1` over our accounts, but I might be wrong, or I might forget (/not correctly automate) to add the new one.) reply viraptor 12 hours agorootparentprevIt sure could. If you're sharding by id and have some per-shard resources, they could definitely get permissions to only accounts 12345*.

If you mean all, you can wildcard * - but there doesn't seem to be any legitimate cases for \"all account ids beginning with a 1\". reply remus 12 hours agorootparentPresumably the permissions language is broadly defined and has something like filter = property, operand, value with few constraints on which operands can be used in which situations, to keep parsing the language simple (parsers being notoriously prone to vulnerabilities after all).

Perhaps that is a bad assumption. reply jameshart 15 hours agorootparentMy general assumption is not that they’re random, but at least that they’re not correlated; in particular that Amazon is not in the habit of handing out, like, account IDs 676363687000 - 676363687999 to a single organization. Even if they did hand out a sequential batch of 1000 account IDs, it would be more likely to be 676363687541 - 676363688540 than a set with a single consistent prefix. Odds are that an account wildcard match like 676363687* will just match a few hundred entirely random AWS accounts. reply naniwaduni 12 hours agorootparent> in particular that Amazon is not in the habit of handing out, like, account IDs 676363687000 - 676363687999 to a single organization Honestly, wouldn't surprise me that much if they were willing to accommodate this if for sufficiently large accounts.

Last week for one of my side projects I built something that lets you write queries in a format inspired by OWL and it has a library of relational operators that can, say, extract the host from a URL or do a prefix query, like query, regex query, etc. As it is my side project’s side project I do what is easy so these operators are always available even in cases where they don’t make sense (I dunno what happens if you try a regex query on a number, I don’t care) I can imagine there is something a bit like this inside AWS but for a security-sensitive system with a lot of users you have a different standard. reply johnklos 14 hours agoparentprevThis is like matching a bitfield on the group ID on a Unix system. I could see someone coming up with this idea, and I could see them thinking this is somehow smart, but implementing it on systems that aren't 100% in your control would just be silly. reply sylens 16 hours agoprevWhile I wouldn't publicly hand out my account IDs as a general practice, I think you have to expect that some of them will be disclosed at some point. As more third party vendors and SaaS platforms move away from IAM users and access keys to using role assumption as the preferred method of integration (as they should!), the account ID of at least the account you use as their integration point is now known by another party, who have their own dependencies, vulnerabilities, etc. reply SamuelAdams 12 hours agoparentThis is what I’m curious to learn.

Illustrative example: I had to deal with a third party that we needed to integrate with because of anti-money laundering procedures a year or two ago. I wanted my team to setup a privatelink with the organization because that's generally more secure than an open sftp port. The company refused citing security reasons to hide their Account Id (it's needed for the role ARN used for reciprocal permissions to PV endpoints). So what did we do? We ended up whitelisting a range of public IPs they use for inbound port 22... Moral of the story: you may think you are a genius for obfuscating your IDs, but you can't really run a business unless people have an address back to you reply stingraycharles 7 hours agoparentAWS PrivateLink has another property that generally makes it undesirable for these types of integrations: communication is bidirectional, and IP subnets should not overlap. We (as a vendor ourselves) typically integrate as a VPC Endpoint Service, where communication is unidirectional and our service is exposed as a load balancer’s endpoint within the customer’s VPC. reply EE84M3i 5 hours agorootparentI thought PrivateLink was branding for vpc interface endpoints?

I really wish that AWS had a simple way from an admin account to ask \"where is X resource\" within an organization to quickly tell me which account has a specific S3 bucket (and other things, but s3 buckets is the big one). Admittedly this is mostly an issue with legacy buckets that existed before better practices and buckets all being defined in code. But with a ton of AWS accounts it can be tedious to hunt down a resource in an unknown account and possibly region. reply emilburzo 16 hours agoparentIf you use AWS config setup for the organization (aggregator), you'll get a athena-sql-queryable inventory of all your resources from all organization accounts.

I don’t want people to get all my banana data, but as long as there isn’t an easy way to list banana uuids, that endpoint is basically effective security by obscurity. reply disruptiveink 11 hours agorootparentThat's an unfortunately common misconception. Your example is not security though obscurity any more than password authentication is, though. Security through obscurity means substituting security for a flawed algorithm that is usually trivial to exploit if the attacker is made aware of the algorithm. Think things like no authentication and ROT13ing and Base64ing clientside. If the method leaks or is discovered, the whole system is broken. You just told me your algorithm and I cannot get to your banana because the UUID key space is insanely large. So that's not security to obscurity. reply mdavidn 11 hours agorootparentprevThere are some important caveats to consider: Client and server software will not handle URLs like secrets, so UUIDs will leak out through various channels. Some examples include logs, user analytics, ad networks, browser history, bookmarks, e-mail, instant messages, shady browsers, shady ISPs, referrer headers, etc. You cannot rotate resource identifiers without breaking clients, so a leaked URL is permanently leaked. Hopefully you're using version 4 UUIDs. Those set aside 6 bits to encode UUID details, keeping 122 bits of entropy. Since every banana needs its own identifier, subtract the number of bits needed to uniquely represent bananas. What's left will unavoidably be less guess-resistant than client secrets. Other versions of UUID use many more bits for low-entropy purposes. reply a16r 11 hours agorootparentprevOWASP has some specific guidance on this while clarifying the need for access controls: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Dire... reply ed 16 hours agoprevHow might this matter?

AWS doesn’t design anything that assumes your account ID is secret, and you shouldn’t either. reply electroly 17 hours agorootparentWhile I agree, the way you wrote this might mislead people into thinking that you meant you can treat your account ID as non-secret because AWS does. That doesn't directly follow; the difference between AWS's point of view and your company's point of view means there are things you might care about that AWS does not. Rather, you need to follow AWS's lead and design your cloud deployment such that the account ID doesn't leak anything interesting about your business that you'd prefer to keep private. Correlated ownership of buckets (e.g. different clients of the same design firm) in particular is something AWS doesn't care about, but you might. If you don't want people to know that the buckets have the same owner, better split it up into separate accounts to preserve the non-secretness of the account ID. reply abadpoli 16 hours agorootparentNo, this is wrong. The fact that AWS does not consider the ID a secret means that your company never should either. If your company “cares” about its ID being secret, then your company is designing its systems in an insecure way. The fact that AWS does not treat the ID as secret means you have no guarantees that anyone within AWS cannot see or find your ID. You also have no guarantee that AWS at some point won’t expose your ID to the world and break your entire security model, because AWS doesn’t think it’s secret. If you do, you’re basing your security off of false assumptions. reply electroly 16 hours agorootparentYou've said \"this is wrong\" and then repeated exactly my point back to me. I suspect some misunderstanding has occurred here. We are agreeing on this--you need to follow AWS's lead and design your cloud deployment such that the account ID doesn't leak anything interesting about your business. That's a direct quote from my original post. I further gave an example--if you're a design firm using a single account for different clients, you're leaking the information that they are your customers. Better split it up into separate accounts to preserve the non-secretness of the account ID--another direct quote from my original post. Stated another way: you can unintentionally make your account ID sensitive if you're not careful. You have to be careful. reply abadpoli 16 hours agorootparentI think we agree, but either your meaning or your words are giving me pause. > you can treat your account ID as non-secret because AWS does. That doesn't directly follow; It does follow, and not only that, but not only “can” you treat them as non-secret, you _must_ treat them as non-secret. > the difference between AWS's point of view and your company's point of view means there are things you might care about that AWS does not The point here is that if you want to have good security, you _cannot_ “care” about this if your service provider does not also care about it. If you “care” about your ID being public, but your provider does not, then if you want to have good security you must either find a way to not care, or find another provider. reply electroly 16 hours agorootparentCorrelation of bucket ownership isn't a security issue at all. I never used that word in my posts, and the author of this article also never suggested that it was. That's the point--there are other considerations that AWS does not care about, but your business does. Your cloud deployment needs to be designed such that the account IDs do not leak information that your business doesn't want to be revealed. You don't get the non-secretness for \"free\"--you have to think about it and be careful on how you isolate things into accounts. As far as I can tell, we agree on all of this and have just suffered some misunderstanding in this thread. reply jasode 16 hours agorootparentprev>The fact that AWS does not consider the ID a secret means that your company never should either.

Just because it is not a secret does not mean that is disclosure is not valuable. You need that information to compromise it. It narrows all the possible account IDs to one. Is that ID already compromised? Can you gain access through someone else that does the work for you? You can cross reference with other systems you have compromised. Is that account ID in their system? What access does that give you? Etc, etc. It is not a secret, but it absolutely is valuable. For example, if you considered it a secret (even though it is not), you might not choose to use third parties that require it, and that can improve your security posture. reply kube-system 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, operational security might still a valid concern even where there are no issues with digital security. You might have a 100% secure system, but you don't want your competitor to know exactly what you are doing. You might also not consider their knowledge of what you're doing to be a vulnerability, nor think that you should spend many resources on preventing them from knowing, you just don't want to make it easy for them. Cryptography is very black-and-white. Business operational intelligence is not. reply TheIronMark 17 hours agorootparentprevAWS doesn't consider them sensitive, but some organizations do. My feeling is that I would rather avoid leaking any info about my AWS environments. Just because AWS doesn't think they can be dangerous doesn't mean someone else won't find a way. reply abadpoli 16 hours agorootparentAnd those organizations are building their security model off of false assumptions, and are wrong. reply mschuster91 16 hours agorootparentDefense in depth, always assume that anything can get used as an attack vector including AWS itself. reply abadpoli 16 hours agorootparentIt’s not defense in depth to build your security model off of false assumptions, it’s just bad security. reply laserlight 16 hours agorootparentI don't understand your reasoning. Neither my name nor where I live nor my phone number nor my license plate are secrets. Yet I don't go around wearing a t-shirt with my personally identifying information printed on it. What am I missing? reply evandale 13 hours agorootparentThis is posted in other places but Amazon explicitly says they're not secret, sensitive, or confidential. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage... > While account IDs, like any identifying information, should be used and shared carefully, they are not considered secret, sensitive, or confidential information. reply abadpoli 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you knew that there was an assassin out there trying to find you and cause you harm, would you consider “I don’t wear a t-shirt with my address on it” to be any form of protection against that assassin? If you want protection against that, you need to focus on better home security, hiring bodyguards, going to the police etc, and you’re better off assuming that the assassin will find your address regardless of whether or not you wear a t-shirt with it printed on. Put another way: there’s a difference between “I don’t do this thing” and “I rely on not doing this thing for my safety”. The second one makes a lot more assumptions than the first one does, and those assumptions can lead to problems if they are false assumptions. reply laserlight 15 hours agorootparent> Put another way: there’s a difference between “I don’t do this thing” and “I rely on not doing this thing for my safety”. That was my point. The fact that some organizations consider AWS account IDs sensitive is independent of whether they rely on it being sensitive or not. I might have taken all precautions against an assassin attack, yet I won't make the assassin's job easier by announcing my PII to them. The fact that I won't announce my PII says nothing about whether I took the security precautions. reply abadpoli 15 hours agorootparentIf an organization considers it sensitive, that implies they’re putting some level of reliance on it being so. Otherwise there would be no point in considering it sensitive. There’s a difference between “making it easier for an attacker” and using it as a security control, even if it’s not the only security control. The point is that even if you don’t go around wearing a shirt with your address on it, that should never factor in to your designs for security. It should never be considered a security control, even a “defense in depth” one. In fact, your threat model should ideally ask the question “assume someone does walk around with a shirt with my address on it, will I still be safe?” That doesn’t mean you’re actually going to go do it, but if the answer is yes, that’s how you know you’ve done your job. reply Dylan16807 14 hours agorootparentIt's hubris to think any security measures are completely safe. Painting a target is a bad idea. reply abadpoli 8 hours agorootparentYou’re still misunderstanding. I’m not saying you should go “paint a target” on yourself, I’m saying you should assume _someone else is_ going to paint a target on you, and defend yourself accordingly, rather than acting like the lack of a target protects you in any way. reply Dylan16807 5 hours agorootparent> I’m not saying you should go “paint a target” on yourself, Then I don't understand why you object so strongly to the tshirt example unless you're deliberately talking past the person that made it. reply junon 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you place any sort of security assumptions on AWS account IDs into your threat model, you're effectively directly introducing a security vulnerability. If you're not then why include it into your security threat model to begin with? I believe that is their point. Since AWS does not, and has never, treated that information as secret, then there is absolutely no reason to consider it sensitive because there is no security guarantees with how AWS handles those IDs (as this article demonstrates). Thus, either you're including them into your threat model as sensitive and thus immediately opening up yourself to vulnerabilities (bad security), or you're not including them at all (and thus not treating them as sensitive/secret/whatever). The argument the parent had (and that I agree with) is that you should do the latter unless AWS provides a means to work with those IDs securely (it won't because they're not secrets). reply kube-system 14 hours agorootparentThis is a false dichotomy. There is a deep chasm between \"publish everything\", and \"this is a secret\", called operational security. Any time a topic like this comes up, there are people on this forum that try to apply the \"security by obscurity does not work\" principle to every security topic under the sun, when in reality, that principle really only applies to the world of cryptography. In meat space, where humans operate on plaintext, keeping a secret is a very valid approach to some topics. This is why things like NDAs exist. reply evandale 13 hours agorootparentHow is it possible for a user of AWS to keep the account ID secret if Amazon doesn't even consider it secret? If Amazon leaked your account ID they could point to their docs and say the account ID was never meant to be a secret, sensitive, or confidential. reply kube-system 13 hours agorootparentYou can walk over to the user's desk and ask them not to share it. Whether or not Amazon leaks it is unrelated to my employees' ability to follow instructions. There is a lot of data that exists in a space somewhere between \"100% secret\" and \"100% public\". This is one of those situations, for many organizations. reply abadpoli 8 hours agorootparentYou’re wasting your employees time by asking them to keep it secret, when you gain absolutely no benefit from keeping it secret (and in fact are introducing an easy failure point by pretending it’s secret) and you have no guarantees that others are keeping it secret. > This is one of those situations, for many organizations. And those organizations are wrong. reply kube-system 7 hours agorootparentMany organizations just have a blanket policy that you shouldn't be exposing data about an organization's infrastructure unless you need to do it. This is a good policy. > by pretending it’s secret No, nobody needs to pretend it is secret. You're missing my above point. There is not a dichotomy between secret and public. It is possible for something to be neither secret nor public. reply junon 7 hours agorootparentprevAnd what OpSec benefit is there? reply kube-system 6 hours agorootparentWell, as a very relevant example, if you tell others what your AWS account ID is, they can figure out if you own any particular bucket. The metadata association between the content of that bucket and the owner might give away information that the contents of the bucket doesn't indicate on its own. It also might not be a technical vulnerability, but that association itself could imply some proprietary business information. Or it could give clues to any would-be attacker as to other resources to target. In business, there are lots of types of information that are not secret, but are also not public. reply elcomet 16 hours agorootparentprevIf you assume it is a secret, you might start to use it as an access key, or similar things. That's where the error is. You should assume it is public (but avoid publishing it yourself of course, that's defense in depth) reply catlifeonmars 14 hours agorootparentprevI think making the assumption that account IDs won’t leak is the problem. It’s safer to assume that someone out there already has a directory of account IDs to buckets and that your efforts are better expended on other things, like actual secrets. reply dekhn 17 hours agorootparentprevI've gotten in long arguments with senior IT people who refuse to believe this even when they talk to AWS directly about it. reply dylan604 16 hours agorootparentI guess anything that looks like random letters/numbers is going to be considered a secret to some people. If it wasn't meant to be secret, it would be human readable. Or some such nonsense. reply 1letterunixname 12 hours agorootparentprevYes. * * Security through obscurity provides secondary security only, so it doesn't add to defense-in-depth significantly. If it can be added, then it is slightly safer to prefer to do so. Elimination of unprivileged enumeration and internal primary key predictability are relatively more important to reduce the attack surface. reply tracebit 17 hours agoparentprevAWS do not define account IDs as a secret (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage...) but until now it's not been possible to do this look up. reply fnordpiglet 16 hours agoparentprevThey’re not a secret, in fact it’s what you use to share the identity of one account with another, possibly third party’s account. It’s a secret in the way your personal email address is. You may not advertise it on 4chan, but you definitely share it to limited audiences. Once you’ve shared it it’s no longer an actual secret. Indeed, as has been noted, aws itself doesn’t treat your account id as a secret and freely shares it within aws, logs it in plain text, uses it for operations with human operators, internal reporting, etc. It’s an identifier, it’s discoverable, shareable, and leaks all over the place. This is not the stuff secrets are made of. Trying to eek some sort of security story out of hiding account ids plays right into security through obscurity. As it’s not treated as a secret the most you’re doing is obscuring the attack surface of your infrastructure. IAM doesn’t allow anyone to use the knowledge of your account ID to grant any privilege not specifically granted within the account itself via two way grants. Holes in your IAM policies aren’t protected by hiding the account ID, they’re protected by closing the holes. reply sroussey 16 hours agorootparentYes, but I do use random email addresses (that look like passwords) to stop correlation, concerted credential stuffing (that might lock me out for a time), etc. And if it pops up in a compromised server no one will know that email address is mine. reply fnordpiglet 12 hours agorootparentAnd aws also offers ideas like external IDs and similar concepts to do something like this. But you might notice that even aws services advertise their own account ids. They’re not secrets and treating them as such doesn’t help you improve security. reply jameshart 16 hours agoparentprevAWS account IDs aren’t secret, but the identity of who owns particular S3 bucket names is meant to be. If you get an email apparently from AWS that correctly names an S3 bucket and the associated account ID, are you more likely to take it seriously than an email that just names a bucket? reply afavour 16 hours agorootparentNot to mention it also means you can establish relationships between buckets by finding common ownership. No, the account ID isn’t secret but I don’t think we should be dismissive of this new information either. It’s still important metadata to factor into decision making. reply btown 16 hours agorootparentprevMore generally, this opens up all sorts of threat models for espionage and alternative data. A private bucket called project-foobar-logs-staging might have its existence known in an index but never have been known to be associated with Baz Corp's publicly-known image buckets - but with this disclosure, a database will become available making that association possible. And it will be possible to monitor if and when project-foobar-logs-prod gets provisioned. Not to mention that state-level actors would love to see an enumerable list of projects their rivals are working on, and if any of them happen to have been secured only by obscurity in the past. Edge cases, to be sure, but certainly nontrivial. reply corytheboyd 13 hours agoparentprevEveryone here throwing down the “technically not a secret” card but I don’t think that was your point. I guess “sensitive, but not secret” is the right way to say it. They’re obviously not secret like credentials, but it’s a damn good piece of info for an attacker to hold against you, because, like you said, it’s impossible to rotate, but is tangentially related to every single part of your AWS infrastructure (per-account of course). reply evandale 13 hours agorootparentIt's not even sensitive or confidential though, Amazon says that themselves in their docs. reply corytheboyd 13 hours agorootparentI guess I disagree with the AWS documentation then. It should be treated as a sensitive piece of information that should not be exposed to the public. It’s not going to bring you down if it’s leaked, but it could be used along with other leaked info over years in more sophisticated attacks. Why risk it is more the point. reply paulddraper 13 hours agoparentprevNot at all. In fact, when delegating IAM access (where security is top of mind), account IDs are shared liberally. Account IDs are as secret as phone numbers. That bit of info could be tangentially useful to an attack, but really shouldn't be assumed to be secret in any meaningful way. reply INTPenis 16 hours agoparentprevIt's valuable info to any pentester. Security by obscurity is still one layer of security. reply Uehreka 16 hours agorootparentBut there’s a reason people advise against security by obscurity: the obscurity can go away at any time and once it does it’s unrecoverable. So sure, maybe pat yourself on the back today that on top of your other measures, no one outside your org and AWS knows your Account ID. But if it gets out at some point, those other measures should be foiling your pentesters on their own. In fact, to better test that this is the case, you should probably give the pentesters your account ID so you can be informed regarding your security in this scenario. reply kube-system 13 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, until humans have crypto modules installed in their brains, we will have to rely on some form of \"security by obscurity\" that many colloquially call \"operational security\". Yes, there are types of data and metadata about your company's infrastructure that can be used against you. But no, you shouldn't hand it to attackers on a silver platter. > In fact, to better test that this is the case, you should probably give the pentesters your account ID so you can be informed regarding your security in this scenario. That depends on the scope of the test. Many organizations will do both (and others) to test different layers of security. Remote software exploits are something that many people on this forum are concerned about, but that is hardly the be-all-end-all of security for an organization. There's a lot of security topics entirely outside the scope of computer systems to be cognisant about here. reply corytheboyd 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen obscurity is the only option, like opting not to expose AWS account ID, why not do it? Don’t think this should be conflated with replacing proper security with obscurity, which is obviously wrong. The less you expose about your operation, the better. Not exposing details of your infrastructure to the public is another commonly suggested best practice that is obscurity, not security, that nobody challenges. For example, cleaning up common default response headers for things like cloud front. reply evandale 13 hours agorootparentYou can't keep it secret because Amazon doesn't keep it secret. So if Amazon doesn't keep the account ID a secret how can you as a user of Amazon be expected to keep your account ID secret? There's no way for you to stop Amazon from exposing it. reply corytheboyd 13 hours agorootparentYou as a user of Amazon can do whatever you want though, including being careful about which pieces of information you elect to expose publicly. If it’s up to you, why choose to expose it, when you can choose NOT to? Just because this reverse search of bucket to account id exists doesn’t mean you should begin to expose your account id on your own. reply evandale 13 hours agorootparentYou can't choose NOT to expose it because you can't stop Amazon from exposing it. Amazon says it's not secret, so it's not secret. They make no attempts or guarantees to keep it secret so there's always the threat that Amazon themselves can expose it on your behalf. You can't stop that no matter how wrong you think it is. reply INTPenis 12 hours agorootparentprevDoesn't change the fact that security by obscurity is a layer of security. It's not a good layer, it's not one you should depend on, but it is a layer that causes problems for attackers. reply busymom0 17 hours agoprevSlightly related - CloudFlare account_id and zone_id are safe to be public https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-docs/issues/474 https://community.cloudflare.com/t/api-zone-id/355566 > The Zone ID and Account ID are not sensitive. Sensitive data like account API Key, Secrets etc. can all be revoked, rotated or changed. See the comment 36 below on the Wrangler repo: as per our security team, it’s completely Fine to have your zone_id and account_id public, the Global API key and associated email address should be kept secret. reply abadpoli 17 hours agoparentAWS account ID is also safe to be public. That said, one thing I could think of that this could be used for is correlation. If you’re running multiple S3 sites from the same AWS account, people would be able to see that they’re hosted by the same account. Whether or not this matters depends on your threat model. reply tracebit 17 hours agorootparentExactly - this isn't going to open the door for someone but could add a ton of value to enumeration. As we are very canary focused, we also think it's interesting to consider the implications of the recent research from Truffle Security w.r.t canary tokens (https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/canaries). reply sroussey 16 hours agorootparentprevOh, there are other things... like a compromised chrome extension that only looks for your accountID being used and sends back credentials. Knowing an accountId tells you where to focus your efforts. You got through one hoop (of many). reply mschuster91 17 hours agorootparentprev> AWS account ID is also safe to be public. Not necessarily. An AWS account ID + the knowledge of a role name that by mistake has the \"allow role assumption\" allowlist too wide (say \"*\") is now enough to take over the account. One might of course say \"well then don't do that\", but of course the more complex a system like IAM is the easier it is for unexperienced people to open the floodgates. reply anamexis 17 hours agorootparentWell sure, but your account email isn't safe to be public if your password is \"password\". reply mschuster91 16 hours agorootparentEmail providers have rate limits against specific user logins, IAM not. reply hiatus 15 hours agorootparentHow do you know that? reply mschuster91 11 hours agorootparentThat's easy to find out: change the API credentials of a user, but forget to update the service. Notice only a few days later that you forgot the change, but you also never got any notification \"something\" is going wrong. In contrast, every half-decent IdP will lock an account automatically after anything from 3-10 wrong attempts. reply dekhn 16 hours agorootparentprevTurning what you said around, you're arguing you might want to keep an account ID secret for \"security by obscurity\" reasons. In my mind, even in a multi-layer security solution, even then the account ID should be considered as a public string whose knowledge (along with other bits like what misconfigurations it has) provides no additional vector of attack, because of defense in depth. reply latchkey 14 hours agoparentprevFor CF accounts, I use the gmail `+ feature` to make a totally unique email address that cannot be easily guessed. Not perfect, but adds another layer of abstraction. reply busymom0 14 hours agorootparentIf I remember right, the pre-signed url generated for R2 uploads include the account ID in it. reply daveevad 4 hours agoprev> the ability to use StringLike conditions so much depends upon a regular expression reply datadeft 11 hours agoprevSometimes I am having trouble finding my own AWS account id... reply mise_en_place 11 hours agoprevThis is kind of a big deal, but also not really?

To chime in my 2c; we've had this debate in multiple orgs with different security teams and the outcome has always been the same; they're not and it's counterproductive to your security posture to treat it as privileged information. Humans have a nasty habit of placing trust in people who have access to privileged information. \"Hi, this is Tom from AWS, I need to speak with you about your account 5923965523\" - as a social engineering primer garners significantly different levels of trust from the target depending on whether the target perceives the account ID to be privileged information. reply cj 15 hours agoprev> While account IDs, like any identifying information, should be used and shared carefully, they are not considered secret, sensitive, or confidential information. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage... reply panarky 15 hours agoparentWhat does this mean?

Many AWS customers incorrectly configure resources such that any other AWS customer can access things in their AWS account; for example, some 3rd party providers tell customers to configure access for the 3rd party, that can lead to wide-open access for anyone who knows the customer's account ID. If the cloud admins don't know what they're doing it can be very easy to screw up and not realize it. It's sort of like giving someone your IP address. By itself it's not enough to hack someone. But if your host is insecure, it sure makes it easier knowing exactly where to attack. reply dexwiz 14 hours agorootparentprevThere are levels of data classification, and different regulations and policies apply to each level and geo.

The other attack vector is from insiders. Many organizations \"shield\" identifiable information behind UUIDs or some other scheme. In the event of a breach, the UUID might mean nothing to most (it's not foolproof, though), but opens more doors for an insider. reply thekevan 13 hours agorootparentprevMy personal phone number is not exactly secret or confidential, but I only share it carefully. reply dimitrios1 15 hours agoparentprevSeems like at least in the digital world, there is either public or private information, and that's it.

For example, my home address is technically public, but I most certainly wouldn't want it lambasted across the interstate with a picture of my family next to it advertising where I live.

If so, Satya just wrapped up pretty much the two largest names in AI other than Google. Sad but expected that Mistral is releasing its newer models as closed source. There was never a clear revenue stream from the open models. I'm confused why they aren't allowing their models to be finetuned, though — that seems like an obvious way to compete with OpenAI, which only allows finetuning of its pretty weak gpt-3.5-turbo. Sure, Mistral can't quite beat GPT-4 yet, even if it's close — but allowing finetuning would likely result in way better than GPT-4 performance on a broad variety of tasks (as long as you picked a few to specialize in). reply IAmNotACellist 10 hours agoparent>other than Google Which has proven worse than useless. It's a brand-damaging laughing stock. reply JeremyNT 7 hours agorootparentI've used Gemini and find it no worse than ChatGPT for the kind of questions I ask of it. reply kranner 5 hours agorootparentGemini seems much better than GPT-4 in image understanding. Here's a test I did trying to read Persian from an image: https://chat.openai.com/c/bc45cc9c-fd19-4359-9096-3936d4d17a... https://gemini.google.com/app/3286bdfb5f24cd36 I can read Persian and can confirm Gemini (not even the Advanced model) got it right while GPT-4 blew it. reply themoonisachees 3 hours agorootparentPretty sure gpt-4 is doing image-to-llm directly while Gemini also runs the image through Google lens which is tailor-made for OCR. I think that's a good thing to create a better product overall but the performance isn't really comparable reply kingsleyopara 1 hour agorootparentAt least in my tests, GPT-4 also seems suspiciously good at reading text so it’d be surprised if they weren’t also doing this. reply jonny_eh 6 hours agorootparentprevComplaining about Google's AI has become some kind of right-wing culture war thing. reply AnarchismIsCool 5 hours agorootparentVery-leftist here. They're becoming an everyone culture war thing because what they did was sufficiently brain-dead as to make everyone look bad. It was sufficiently skewed as to create a number of extremely racist images just because it was trying way too hard to avoid it. That said, those of us in-the-know understand that this is just part of the cycle and they'll go back to being annoyingly bland and completely devoid of entertainment value soon. reply marginalia_nu 9 hours agorootparentprevGoogle's always been kinda garbage at marketing. Their challenges don't seem to be technical, as much as organizational. reply nine_zeros 9 hours agorootparentIt is organizational. The amount of time people spend on performance reviews and other organizational dances can easily be harvested for more productive activities. But no. Thousands of employees gotta do the dance for blind committees. reply knowriju 2 hours agorootparentWow, somebody has a deep wound that still hurts. reply behnamoh 9 hours agoparentprev> I'm confused why they aren't allowing their models to be finetuned They already have difficulty serving the large model (as evident in their pricing). Finetuning would introduce even more compute challenge. reply reissbaker 6 hours agorootparentSure, but why not let Azure offer it as a service? reply option 10 hours agoparentprevIt's not close. Long tail is probably as hard for LLMs as it is for search. reply bhouston 19 hours agoprevThis is just a smart move by Satya Nadella after the non-standard drama that occurred with OpenAI a few months back where it nearly imploded and then didn't. You want both a backup for OpenAI as well as negotiating leverage if OpenAI gets too powerful and this achieves both. reply bookaway 18 hours agoparentIt's also a good play to try to take resources away from local, self-hosted \"Feasible AI\" solutions. With compute resources, I think Microsoft hopes Mistral skews their focus and resources towards large models that can run only run in the cloud, trying to lure them away with the bait: \"Don't you want to build the best AI possible, independent of compute?\" I'd be surprised if they didn't consider the notion that they are hitting to birds with one stone: OpenAI and Indie AI. reply dhruvdh 17 hours agorootparentIt's not like Microsoft is working on \"Windows AI Studio\" [1], or released Orca, or Phi. It's not like there's any talk of AI PCs with mandatory TOPs requirements for Windows 12. Big bad Microsoft coming for your local AI, beware. [1] https://github.com/microsoft/windows-ai-studio reply drakenot 6 hours agorootparentThe whole embrace, extend.. ? > Mistral Remove \"Committing to open models\" from their website That was 5 hours ago. Without having insider details it is hard to know why, but the coincidence of timing with the Microsoft deal is not lost on me. It could have even been a stipulation. reply whimsicalism 17 hours agorootparentprevYou’re downvoted for the snarky tone I guess, but you’re absolutely right reply peteradio 16 hours agorootparentEven easier to rug pull your own teams project than someone else's. reply Zuiii 5 hours agorootparentprevAntitrust. Using their dominance in one market to destroy another. I hope the EU tares them a new one if the us doesn't. reply isoprophlex 15 hours agorootparentprevMoving straight from Embrace to Extinguish, why not! reply loceng 15 hours agorootparentprevFrom my understanding, which may be wrong, you only need the massive compute resources initially to create a compiled vector space LLM - and then that LLM once compiled can be run locally? This is why anti-CSAM measures policy is possible so compiled-release LLMs can have certain vector spaces removed before release; but apparently people are creating cracks for these types of locks? reply extr 10 hours agorootparentYou are a little confused. There’s no “compiling” of LLMs. It’s just once it’s trained, inference takes less compute than further training. So you can run things locally that you couldn’t necessarily train locally. Not sure where you are getting the CSAM bit. We aren’t that good at blanking out weights in any kind of model, certainly not good enough to lobotomize specific types of content. reply JyB 10 hours agorootparentI love that you are using the word lobotomize. reply loceng 10 hours agorootparentprevThanks for the clarification. The CSAM bit seems to then be propaganda from at least one AI company putting out PR to falsely quell people's concerns about their LLMs being able to generate content involving children that's sexualized. I've yet to see details of how much compute-minimum server requirements are necessary to run LLMs. Maybe you know a source who's compiling a list in a feature matrix that includes such details? reply dwaltrip 7 hours agorootparentLarge LLMs like gpt-3 and gpt-4 need very serious hardware. They have hundreds of billions of parameters (or more) which need to be loaded in memory all at once. reply teh_infallible 15 hours agorootparentprevSo.. Embrace, Extend, Extinguish? reply smoldesu 17 hours agorootparentprevI don't see why Mistral would acquiesce. Like the other comment says, Microsoft has a lot of chips on the table for local AI. They didn't even mention DirectML, ONNX or Microsoft's other local AI frameworks - suffice to say Microsoft does care about on-device AI. So... would Mistral deliberately sabotage their low-end models to appease Microsoft's cloud demand? I don't think so. Microsoft probably knows that letting Mistral fall behind would devalue their investment. It makes more sense to bolster the small models to increase demand for the larger ones, at least from where I'm standing. reply tailspin2019 15 hours agoparentprev> This is just a smart move by Satya Nadella Diversifying their AI bets definitely makes total sense. If this wasn't their strategy originally, it almost certainly became so the moment the OpenAI board fired Sam Altman. It's easy to make simplistic judgements from the outside, but with the limited information we have, it does seem like Satya Nadella came out of this OpenAI debacle looking pretty competent. It's hard to reconcile the fact that the Microsoft that handled the unexpected OpenAI issue so well is the same Microsoft that seems intent on literally setting fire to their flagship product! (Windows) reply zitterbewegung 19 hours agoparentprevI totally agree it’s also like the move where Microsoft is at least supporting Linux on their systems and cloud as not a backup but to just close you into their ecosystem . Honestly I could see Microsoft buying Huggingface. reply bhouston 19 hours agorootparentYes, Microsoft doesn't have to pick the sole winner in AI, but rather they could just start eating the AI ecosystem bit by bit so that they win by default. It is what large players can do. May open themselves up to some scrutiny for too many acquisitions and reducing competition though, but that is a separate issue. reply datadrivenangel 17 hours agorootparentThis is how microsoft has been doing data for at least 10 years (See databricks). Step 1: Get the industry leaders to be purchasable via Azure. Step 2: Slowly build your own clone and start stealing user share even though your offering is still worse. reply lostemptations5 19 hours agorootparentprevAnd they are used to that issue too. A long history of it. reply solardev 18 hours agorootparentprev\"Microsoft recommends OpenAI as your default overlord. Did you know it can do everything your current AI can do, sometimes better, but always more profitably for us? [Switch now] [Ask me again in 30 seconds]\" reply JimDabell 19 hours agorootparentprevI’ve had similar thoughts, Microsoft buying Huggingface would be very similar to them buying GitHub. reply bugglebeetle 15 hours agorootparentPlease, god, no. I can’t think of two more antithetical companies. reply jahsome 5 hours agorootparentWould you mind elaborating why? I'm not super experienced in the AI world, and barely use Hugging Face. Frankly, the name makes it difficult to take it seriously. reply btown 17 hours agorootparentprevThis has me thinking about the context behind the striking quote in https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-microsoft-swallo... (May 2023, months before the OpenAI drama): > Nadella [in December 2022] abruptly cut off Lee midsentence, demanding to know how OpenAI had managed to surpass the capabilities of the AI project Microsoft’s 1,500-person research team had been working on for decades. “OpenAI built this with 250 people,” Nadella said, according to Lee, who is executive vice president and head of Microsoft Research. “Why do we have Microsoft Research at all?” > At the same time, even as the company began weaving OpenAI into the fabric of Microsoft’s products, Nadella decided not to abort Microsoft’s own research efforts in AI. During the tense exchange at the December meeting between the Microsoft CEO and Lee, other executives spoke up to defend the work of Microsoft’s researchers, including Mikhail Parakhin, who oversees Microsoft’s Bing search and Edge browser groups, Lee said. After grilling Lee in the meeting, Nadella called him privately, thanking him for the work Microsoft Research had done to understand and implement OpenAI’s work in a way that passed muster for corporate customers. Nadella said he saw Lee’s group as a “secret weapon.” While this is entirely speculation, it's easy to imagine that there are many levels of PR magic going on here, to share a quote that on the surface feels \"leaked\" and \"explosive\" but, among investors and clients who read beyond the (very good) paywall, actually shores up a narrative that Microsoft has a capability that significantly augments OpenAI's, and allows the existence of MSR to become headline news without even needing a product release. The Mistral deal feels like yet another step in this direction. Microsoft is not afraid of seeming \"messy\" in the press as long as it can control the narrative around its value-add to customers in the context of its partnerships. By contrast, the rest of FAANG's more consumer-facing positioning makes it a lot harder for them to maneuver in a similar way. reply karolist 17 hours agorootparent> Nadella [in December 2022] abruptly cut off Lee midsentence, demanding to know how OpenAI had managed to surpass the capabilities of the AI project Microsoft’s 1,500-person research team had been working on for decades. “OpenAI built this with 250 people,” Nadella said, according to Lee, who is executive vice president and head of Microsoft Research. “Why do we have Microsoft Research at all?” The answer to that is till Google released the Attention is All You Need paper in 2017 there were no breakthroughs allowing models as we have now to be built, OpenAI being a small and nible team picked up on which direction the wind is blowing with LLMs and quickly brought a product to market whilst MS just did what corps do - move slowly (same for Google etc). reply zitterbewegung 17 hours agorootparentMicrosoft research has also been not solely devoted in AI I have seen much in quantum computing and programming language research and general computer science . reply probably_satan 17 hours agorootparentprevThey did that because they can't compete with Linux and had no relevancy in the tech world outside of providing business users with terrible software reply dkjaudyeqooe 18 hours agoparentprevThe pro is that MS buys more AI hype to pump up their share price. The con is that MS attracts more attention from regulators. reply datavirtue 7 hours agorootparentThose same regulators who check Microsoft's stock price regularly to see how 25% of their retirement plan is doing? reply Xenoamorphous 19 hours agoparentprevI guess it has a cost, though? I presume OpenAI didn’t like this move. If that’s the case, what might be the consequences? reply bhouston 19 hours agorootparent> I guess it has a cost, though? I presume OpenAI didn’t like this move. If that’s the case, what might be the consequences? Until OpenAI releases GPT 5 and it blows everyone away, OpenAI's leverage is constantly decreasing as the gap between their best model and everyone else's best model decreases. There doesn't seem to be moats right now in this industry except for pure model performance. Maybe someone should as ChatGPT what OpenAI should do to maintain long-term leadership in this industry? reply robrenaud 17 hours agorootparentIf I had to pick one player who wanted to win the AI race and was willing to be ruthless to do it, I'd pick Nvidia. Computation is the excludable bottleneck, and Nvidia is the essentially the singular company who makes AI computers. Hire Ilya, get him to hire as many of the best folks he can. Stop selling GPUs. Hoard them. Introduce some subtle bug into the drivers that dramatically increases their rate of burn out. Figure out some reasonable way to give attribution to original content creators, approximately solve the content ID problem of the AI age. Cut the content creators into the rev share in proportion to their data importance to the model. Make the content creators incredibly pissed off that their work is being stolen by big AI companies unfairly and encourage to them to sue the other big AI firms. Their content share multiplier increases if they get injunctions against LLM firms. Convince politicians that the AI firms have performed an intellectual heist of epic proportions, and that they must not be allowed to even generate synthetic training data from poisoned models. With the content creators united behind you, convince congress that poisoned models must be destroyed, that even using synthetic training data from poisoned models must be illegal. Make them start over from a clean room with no copyrighted data. reply ben_w 16 hours agorootparent> Make them start over from a clean room with no copyrighted data. And when such models become popular[0], all the artists now have no job and no way to get compensation for being unable to work through no fault of their own. I don't think that's really a winning condition. It might make you feel better about the world, but the end result is still all the artists being out of work. [0] some models are already trained that way, although I assume you're using the word \"copyrighted\" in the conventional sense of \"neither public domain nor an open license\", as e.g. all my MIT licensed stuff is still copyrighted but it's fine to use. reply rusticpenn 40 minutes agorootparent> It might make you feel better about the world, but the end result is still all the artists being out of work. Is it not the same with every leap in technology? There were professions like street lamp lighters, alarm services etc that have become redundant now? reply robrenaud 15 hours agorootparentprevIn my hypothetical future, at least the people who create the content used to train the models can get \"training royalties\", which they aren't getting now. There is still also money to be made in producing physical art or performances, even when AI can produce amazing digital works. reply ben_w 2 hours agorootparent\"Make them start over from a clean room with no copyrighted data.\" makes \"the people who create the content used to train the models\" the empty set. > There is still also money to be made in producing physical art or performances, even when AI can produce amazing digital works. Perhaps, but it may be akin to the way there is still money to be made from horse drawn carriages in city centres, even when cars displaced them over a century ago — a rare treat for special occasions, to demonstrate wealth. reply bhouston 16 hours agorootparentprev>If I had to pick one player who wanted to win the AI race and was willing to be ruthless to do it, I'd pick Nvidia. Computation is the excludable bottleneck, and Nvidia is the essentially the singular company who makes AI computers. I've thought the same thing.

Instead they continued to sell them (with a hefty markup, tho).

Hard disagree. OpenAI's function calling is something no other commercial model provides, not even Gemini and Mistral Large. reply riquito 17 hours agorootparentIs it different from https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/function-calling/ ? reply fzzzy 17 hours agorootparentprevThe mixtral large marketing at the top of hn right now claims json mode and native function calling. I haven't tried it, but that's what they say. reply ben_w 16 hours agorootparentprevEh, all this talk of \"moats\" etc. feels weird when just a few years ago it seemed like everyone was complaining they'd rearranged their corporate structure to include a fully-owned profit-making subsidiary to attract investments, and all the loud voices seemed to think a cap of x100 return on investment was so large it was unlikely to be reached. And then OpenAI tripped and fell over a magic money printing factory, and the complaints are now in the set [\"it's just a stochastic parrot\", \"it's so good it's a professional threat to $category\", \"they've lobotomised it\", \"they don't have a moat\", \"they're too expensive\"]. As the saying goes, \"Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future!\" reply asynchronous 18 hours agorootparentprevThey also have brand recognition, for what it’s worth. Every non-engineer in the world practically thinks AI == ChatGPT. reply bhouston 18 hours agorootparentSure that helps with the consumer market, but most people will use AI integrated into other products and not directly. Those integrated AI solutions will usually be done via enterprise deals where brand name is not quite as important. It will be done by people who care about cost, reliability and ease of use. Think of nginx's dominance in web servers even though it has no name recognition among the general population. Or Stripe's payment system. reply vinay427 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, however it's increasingly likely that the GPT in ChatGPT will not be limited to OpenAI (in the US), so I'm not sure how much ChatGPT will be worth with countless other platforms containing GPT in their names. https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/no-gpt-trademark-for-opena... reply ethanbond 18 hours agorootparentprevMeh, I don't think it's worth much. In a few years that'll be like claiming that so-and-so had name brand recognition for transistors. Most people don't need to care who manufactures their transistors. reply donny2018 17 hours agorootparentIt’s not necessarily a bad thing. Most people don’t know that TSMC exists, or what Microsoft does beyond Windows and Xbox (which are a small fraction of its business). reply ethanbond 15 hours agorootparentCorrect, I didn't say it's a bad thing. I said it's not clear that it's a good thing (i.e. an asset) reply ben_w 16 hours agorootparentprevBrands can change quickly, but they do matter in the short term. I've witnessed customer support teams use Firefox to say they only supported Internet Explorer and government ministers who thought it was \"good\" that IE was the \"only\" web browser, and weirdly a phone company whose customer support person thought their SIM cards worked better on Android than iPhone and that their web chat wouldn't work with a Mac even though they were talking to me on a Mac at the time. And when I was a kid, it seemed like all the teachers thought it would be a waste of time to learn MacOS because \"Apple would be bankrupt soon\". (Given how much all the app UIs changed, right decision for the wrong reason). reply ethanbond 15 hours agorootparentAll of these examples are end-products. \"AI\" itself will not be. The winner in AI will be whoever permeates other products/brands most successfully, and end-user brand familiarity doesn't matter much for that. Familiarity among engineering and product leaders is what matters. reply mitjam 14 hours agorootparentMaybe, but maybe AI will become front and center of consumer and productivity IT products and their premier brand ambassadors will be anthropomorphized AI agents. Hello Clippy, this time for real. reply ben_w 14 hours agorootparentprevIndeed, I'm not disagreeing on that, merely opining that \"ChatGPT\" as a name could well be relevant for a bit. reply bhouston 18 hours agorootparentprevUnless your market is direct to end user, end user brand name recognition doesn't matter. In the case of AI, at least so far, the primarily income won't be from end-users directly, but rather via enterprise integrations into existing tools that already have end user market share (e.g. Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows, VS Code, Notion, etc.) reply CamperBob2 17 hours agorootparentprevMost people don't need to care who manufactures their transistors. They might, in an upside-down world where the Shockley Semiconductor board tried to fire Shockley, and where the Traitorous Eight not only didn't bail out but took his side. reply YetAnotherNick 18 hours agorootparentprevThe thing is that there is almost no lock in in the models. So brand recognition doesn't help much as people look into the benchmarks and price sometime in the future, if not when just starting out. reply jorvi 17 hours agorootparentprev> There doesn't seem to be moats right now in this industry except for pure model performance. Compute? At least in the short term, it seems like the biggest wallets are going to win by default. reply iambateman 18 hours agorootparentprevI suppose they didn't but Microsoft has a $3T market cap and OpenAI is theoretically valued at $80B. OpenAI has 700 people, Microsoft has 220,000 people. OpenAI is strong but they're still dependent on MSFT. reply cuckatoo 17 hours agorootparentMSFT needs companies like OpenAI to give Azure credits to for their valuation to continue soaring. The deferred revenue on their balance sheet from the unspent Azure credits they give as investment are worth much more to their market cap than $80B. reply jart 17 hours agorootparentIt sounds like they took the Federal Reserve's business model and applied it to computing. reply consumer451 19 hours agorootparentprevJust to play this out, what possible moves would OpenAI make at this point that they wouldn't have until this happened? Altman is out there trying to raise ridiculous sums to get away from Azure, didn't he make the first move here? reply bhouston 18 hours agorootparentI think the main move would be some type of true AGI that leads to a hard takeoff scenario, but it isn't clear we are close to that or not. Basically something that is more than just another bump in the scorecard for GPT 5 over GPT 4. Otherwise it is still just a horse race between relatively interchangeable GPT engines. reply karmasimida 2 hours agorootparentprevThey are under an exclusive contract with MSFT, they can't do anything. reply yellow_postit 17 hours agorootparentprevOpenAI will want to expand to all clouds to increase TAM. Microsoft will want to avoid things regulators in the current regime will go after. This seems like a step towards both and ultimately good for developers as it seems likely to bring costs down by increasing competition. reply kibwen 19 hours agorootparentprevThere are no consequences for Microsoft. It owns a 49% stake in OpenAI, so the only action that OpenAI could take to hurt Microsoft would be to deliberately destroy its own value. reply epolanski 16 hours agoparentprevPutting multiple bets and having multiple partnerships is smart regardless of OpenAI drama. This way Microsoft is less dependent on a single deal and can diversify their offering based on use cases. reply behnamoh 18 hours agoparentprevSatya is known to play 4-D chess.

They have a responsibility to their shareholders to try and maximize their share price and so it's hardly unsurprising that they did the infamous Embrace Extend Extinguish, and until regulators stepped in, such practices worked pretty well. Most companies don't get large enough to form any kind of real monopoly, so it's easy to get on a high-horse. It's also easy to act like it was just a product of \"those people\", but I fundamentally think that it's a natural consequence of a company that has achieved nearly-total market dominance. I have very little faith that a multi-trillion-dollar company is going to prioritize what's best for the world. Fundamentally, I think that if they feel they can get away with it, they'll revert to monopolistic tendencies and try and increase share price.

LLMs are insanely helpful if you use them with their limitations in mind. reply aleph_minus_one 14 hours agorootparent> LLMs are insanely helpful if you use them with their limitations in mind. This depends on your use case. I can honestly tell that all the chat bot AIs don't \"get\" my kind of thinking about mathematics and programming. Since some friend who is graduate student in computer science did not believe in my judgement, I verbally presented him some test prompts for programming task where I wanted the AI to help me (these are not the most representative ones for my kind of thinking, but are prompts for which it is rather easy to decide whether the AI is helpful or not). He had to agree from the description alone that the AIs will have difficulties with these task, despite the fact that these are common, and very well-defined programming problems. He opined that these tasks are simply too complex for the existing AIs, and suggested that if I split these tasks into much smaller subtasks, the AI might be helpful. Let me put it this way: I personally doubt that if I stated the subtasks in a way in which I would organize the respective programs, the AI would be of help. :-) What was just important for me was to able to convince the my counterpart that whether AIs are helpful or not for programming depends a lot on your kind of thinking about programming and your programming style. :-) reply wing-_-nuts 14 hours agorootparentI would say that the ability to break a problem down into manageable chunks is the mark of a sr dev.

I experimented with such types of prompts in the past and the results were very disappointing. All of these are tasks that I am interested in (in my free time), but would take some literature research to get a correct implementation, so some AI could theoretically be of help if it was capable of doing these tasks. But since for each of these tasks, I don't know all the required details from memory, the code that the AI generates has to be \"quite correct\", otherwise I have to investigate the literature; if I have to do that anyway, the benefit that the AI brings strongly decreases. reply mewpmewp2 2 hours agorootparentI tried the first one, but currently I don't have time to verify what it generated. But I have done many Arduino/Raspberry PI things lately for the first time in my life and I feel like ChatGPT/Copilot has given me a huge boost even if it doesn't always give 100 percent code out of the box, it will give me a strong starting point where I can keep tweaking myself. reply fragmede 13 hours agorootparentprevWhat did happen when you split the question into subtasks?

I use Cursor and the UI is very slick. If I'm stuck on something (like a method that's not working) I can highlight it and hit Cmd+L and it will explain the code and then suggest how to fix it.

Uber, Lyft, Didi, Grab seem to have lost more money than was invested and once they stabilize they look like mediocre businesses at a global scale (Uber's been banned from many jurisdictions for predatory practices and in many other jurisdictions it seems to trend towards being as expensive as taxis or more once profitability becomes a target). reply polski-g 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen Meta \"lost\" 20bn, they actually spent it on salary.

The strings were hardcoded, it knew exactly what they were in no unclear terms. I just wanted it to whip up a script that would use ripgrep and sed to find and replace. First, it gave me a bash script that looked pretty much exactly like what I wanted at first glance. I looked if over, verified it even used sed correctly for macOS like I told it, and then tried to run it. No dice: replace.sh: line 5: designer_option_calendar.start_month.label: syntax error: invalid arithmetic operator (error token is \".start_month.label\") Not wanting to fix the 20 lines myself, I fed the error back to ChatGPT. It spun me some bullshit about the problem being the “declaration of [my] associative array, likely because bash tries to parse elements within the array that aren’t properly quoted or when it misinterprets special characters.” It then spat out a “fixed” version of the script that was exactly the same, it just changed the name of the variable. Of course, that didn’t work so I switched tactics and asked it to write a python script to do what I wanted. The python script was more successful, but the first time it left off half of the strings I wanted it to replace, so I had to ask it to do it again and this time “please make sure you include all of the strings that we originally discussed.” Another short AI example, this time featuring Mistral’s open source model on Ollama. I’d been interested in a script that uses AI to interpret natural language and turn it into timespans. Asking Mistral “if it’s currently 20:35, how much time remains until 08:00 tomorrow morning” had the model return its typical slew of nonsense and the answer of “13.xx hours”. This is obviously incorrect, though funnily enough when I plugged its answer into ChatGPT and asked it how it thought Mistral may have come to that answer, it understood that Mistral did not understand midnight on a 24 hour clock. These are just some of my recent issues with AI in the past week. I don’t trust it for programming tasks especially — it gets F# (my main language) consistently wrong. Don’t mistake me though, I do find it genuinely useful for plenty of tasks, but I don’t think the parent commenter is wrong calling it snake oil either. Big tech sells it as a miracle cure to everything, the magic robot that can solve all problems if you can just tell it what the problem is. In my experience, it has big pitfalls. reply codexon 13 hours agorootparentI have the same experience. Every time I try to have it code something that isn't completely trivial or all over the internet like quicksort, it always has bugs and invents calls to functions that don't exist.

Is that the only variable that one needs to consider to gauge if this is bubble territory? reply jstummbillig 14 hours agorootparentOther variables is basically what I was asking for, in the first sentence of my comment. reply philoinvestor 13 hours agorootparentHow many GPUs are being delivered today and for how long will they be used / what's their life? Who is funding the purchase of those GPUs? If VC money then what happens if the startups don't make money? Are users using AI-apps because they are free and dump them soon? Isn't their competition in semiconductors? Won't we have chips-as-a-commodity soon? LLMs-as-a-commodity? Is Big Tech spending all this money to create VALUE or just to survive the next phase of the technological revolution? (e.g. the AI rush) If prices are high, and sales are high, and competition is still low -- then how much is nvidia actually worth? And if we don't now why is it selling for so many times earnings? https://www.philoinvestor.com/p/downside-at-nvidia-and-the-n... reply philoinvestor 14 hours agorootparentprevCan I paste links in replies here? I wrote an article about the AI bubble a few weeks ago. reply nozzlegear 10 hours agorootparentYes you can. reply philoinvestor 17 minutes agorootparentThis piece went viral a few weeks ago: https://www.philoinvestor.com/p/downside-at-nvidia-and-the-n... reply SunlitCat 13 hours agorootparentprevIt's like the previous craze with blockchain. Everyone and their dog was about to use blockchain to do the most awesome thing ever. And even things that didn't really lend themselves to blockchain were suddenly presented as prime examples of how to use blockchain. I'm not saying both technologies don't have their uses, but the hype around them is crazy and not healthy. reply philoinvestor 11 hours agorootparentYep, there are similarities between the blockchain rush and the AI rush. But in my last piece on AI, I said that AI is 50X Blockchain! reply SunlitCat 4 hours agorootparentThat answer inspired me to ask ChatGPT on how blockchain could enhance AI. And, to say the least, I wasn't disappointed! It printed out a pretty long answer with several good points on how it could help to enhance AI. There we have it! Blockchain is about to solve all problems we have today with AI! :D reply hackerlight 10 hours agorootparentprevAI has massively increased my productivity. There are real users like me who will continue to pay up. This is not the same. reply SunlitCat 5 hours agorootparentLike with blockchain, there are real uses, of course i totally agree! But I was more thinking about the craze surrounding the whole thing, like with blockchain, you can see everyone trying to sell you AI for kinda everything. reply oblio 6 hours agorootparentprevYeah, but how many people like you are out there? We'll find out in about 5 years. reply codexon 13 hours agorootparentprevThis technology is already fully automating copywriters and almost replacing concept artists right now. However it is true that right now the valuations are for something far more than that, and so far it doesn't seem like LLMs will be able to do much more. I was talking to someone that just retired from a programming position at a FANG and he seems to think that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is only a few years away just based off what he sees with ChatGPT and he's dumping all his money into AI stocks. The level of hype and over-extrapolation is so absurd, and the fact that it can affect someone with a technical background... It really does seem like a bubble to me. reply ForgotIdAgain 13 hours agorootparentIsn't the role of a concept artist mainly to do worldbuilding and drawing second? AI does not seem to have a good world model, they make pretty pictures but they lack thought behind them. reply aquova 12 hours agorootparentAgreed, and I think there are a number of... over-enthusiastic executives with dollar signs in their eyes who are in for a rude awakening about this. It might sound great to replace your artistic staff with an LLM subscription, until you realize that you laid off all the creative vision with them. That isn't to say I think it'll go away though, I wouldn't be surprised if art students in the future are taught how to wrangle LLMs to supplement their own designs. reply codexon 13 hours agorootparentprevI really don't know the details. You can see a concept artist here discovering he stopped getting work after a company splurted out that they switched to AI. https://twitter.com/_Dofresh_/status/1709519000844083290 My guess is that a lot of people can have ideas, so you don't need an artist to bring them to life anymore. reply ABS 14 hours agorootparentprevP/E ratios (so far) say otherwise: all the big tech public companies have reasonable P/E ratios and are investing heavily their profits in contrast to, say, the dotcom bubble when over 40% of the companies had P/E ratios unsustainably over the moon. Are there a gazillion companies riding the \"AI everywhere\" wave to raise money? yes, yes there are. Will most of them fail? sure. But the big players are fine at the moment so there is nothing that can burst very hard (yet) and the difference is in the denominators which are, so far, going up. Of the top ones only NVIDIA and Amazon have P/E ratios a bit too high and among the top 10 only AMD's is way too high. reply dorkwood 4 hours agorootparentprevThis opinion is so crazy to me. How can it be a bubble if it's already providing me with 10x productivity gains? Things I've used GPT-4 to automate: replaying to all emails, writing entire books, doing all the legal paperwork for my new business, completing daily code challenges, generating shopping lists, writing birthday messages, and replying to my family group chat. And that's when the tech is still relatively new! Once the technology advances and I'm able to automate basically all of my daily tasks, who knows where I'll be. reply philoinvestor 14 hours agorootparentprevI agree that it's opaque and that's why I said that AI can be the ULTIMATE bubble. reply mnky9800n 14 hours agorootparentIt's a shame the phrase \"black box\" exists in machine learning when it could have been \"black bubble\". reply d--b 13 hours agorootparentprevWell that's your view, but we keep seeing incredible progress year on year. Noone thought beating the game of Go was feasible. Noone thought self-driving cars would actually work. Noone predicted ChatGPT. See where we're at now with multi modal models. And Sora. The truth is that you can't predict anything anymore about this tech cause all expectations keep being blown away. AGI may be right there, and that's what's driving the money. reply ArchOversight 13 hours agorootparent> Noone thought self-driving cars would actually work. Many people thought self driving WOULD work and that we'd be further along than we are now. We have vastly overestimated how far we'd be, and vastly underestimated how much time and effort it would actually take. Self driving cars as they exist today are still mere toys compared to where the industry thought they were going to be. Look at Cruise, Waymo, Zoox, Uber's ex-self driving car division and others. We are not anywhere near the self-driving autonomous cars we had hoped for. reply oblio 6 hours agorootparentprev> Noone thought beating the game of Go was feasible. Oh, yes, we did, once we beat chess. It was just a matter of time. > Noone thought self-driving cars would actually work. And... they don't? Call me when I can buy a regular car where I can sleep while traveling 8 hours, driven by the car itself. We're probably \"flying cars\" away from that. reply SirMaster 8 hours agorootparentprevThis doesn’t make any sense. If nobody thought the things were possible then why did they bother trying to do them? And even spend as much time and resources as they did trying to do them? reply Spivak 14 hours agorootparentprev> This is the closest we've ever had to multiple large respected tech companies selling \"snake oil\" a cure all. The problem with this take is you can deliver real results. At current $dayjob we do the very dumbest thing which is text -> labels -> feedback -> fine_tune -> text... and surface them as part of our search offering and it's rocketed to the most useful customer feature in less than 6 months of rolling it out. Customers define labels that are meaningful to them, we have a general-purpose AI classify text according to those labels. Our users gleefully (which is shocking given our industry) label text for us (which we just feed into fine_tuning) because of just how fast they can see the results. Like it's as grug brain as it gets and we bumbled into a feature that's apparently more valuable to our users than the rest of the product combined. Folks want us to sell it as a separate module and we're just hoping they don't realize it's 3 LLMs in a trenchcoat. reply curtisblaine 13 hours agorootparentprev> When the AI bubble bursts I wouldn't be surprised if takes down major tech companies with it. Hopefully, knock wood. Maybe it will even slow down the genrral enshittification created by those major tech companies. reply huytersd 11 hours agorootparentprevEh I don’t know. I find ChatGPT very useful atleast 10 times a day. reply partiallypro 13 hours agorootparentprevI think there is a bubble, but not in the traditional sense of this all being nonsense. Obviously, AI is going to be a world changer, but I think in a few years many companies are going find, at least for them, that their projects using AI are wildly unprofitable. Good AI is expensive. This could take years to play out, but when Nvidia is trading higher than Microsoft and Apple in total market cap, we'll be well into it. I don't rule that out. reply PheonixPharts 14 hours agoparentprevI've stopped believing in rational markets a long time ago. For the people behind this funding madness: > to skew markets, skew the financials of big tech and create a bubble in the space. Are the intended consequences of this. The people behind the money in AI, just like the people behind the money in crypto, don't care if there's a reality to all of this, they just care if they can make a lot of money while the music is playing. I really thought 2022 was going to be the beginning of tech returning to reality, but naively didn't understand that this would entail a lot of people with a lot of money losing money, and that's not going to happen. As with all bubbles, the interesting thing isn't pointing out there's a bubble, we've been living in many bubbles for decades now. The interesting thing is pointing out what will make it pop. So long as globally money keeps pouring into US markets we'll see this continue. On the plus side, at least LLMs are a lot of fun to work and play with! reply rchaud 14 hours agorootparent\"Efficient markets\" deliver normal returns. The people with the most capital to throw at things are trying to create monopolies that can generate supernormal returns. This is already a highly unstable arrangement, and it's made more dangerous by introducing impurities like artificially suppressed interest rates and SPAC IPOs. reply throwup238 14 hours agorootparentprev> I've stopped believing in rational markets a long time ago. It makes a lot more sense if you think of markets as just a bunch of coked out hairless monkeys. Then \"rational\" becomes a lot more meaningful. reply DANmode 14 hours agorootparentprev> I've stopped believing in rational markets a long time ago. Agreed. Sentiment is everything. reply philoinvestor 14 hours agorootparentprevWith the way NVIDIA is moving and how it's seeding AI startups, you could be right about them actively trying to do this. But there is a reality beyond our ability to predict it.. reply tmpz22 15 hours agoparentprevTheres a lot of not-great software that can have bites taken out of it by LLM advancements and most of the incumbents are going to pay into it because they just can't compete in the AI field. Can LLMs become reliable enough at transforming data that it can replace or augment the current slew of ETL tools? Can it produce visualizations better then current BI tools? Can copilot compete with a junior developer? Im not sure, but at this point Im willing to say 50/50 which is worth the bet. reply gitfan86 15 hours agoparentprevThere is a bubble in the valuations of LLMs similar to the valuation of NFTs. Anyone can create a modified version of Llama2. reply thethimble 15 hours agorootparentThe last All in Podcast had an interesting take on this: Most of the R&D and Capex going into LLMs/GenAI is speculative. The investments haven’t translated into real revenue yet. The expectation is that there will be a large pot of revenue at the end of the road, but we haven’t seen the killer apps to substantiate this. This makes for a perfect bubble if the promise doesn’t pan out. Relatedly Nvidia’s revenue - as impressive as the recent growth has been - is fully exposed to this risk. Of course it’s possible (likely?) that there will be major wins from this tech, but the fact that there isn’t definitive proof (in the form of revenue) yet represents real risk. reply pantulis 15 hours agorootparent> The expectation is that there will be a large pot of revenue at the end of the road, but we haven’t seen the killer apps to substantiate this Imho, unlike crypto and NFT, AI is not a solution in search of a problem. While there is a lot of hand waving, it is not very adventurous to predict that there will be significant productivity gains by adding AI on top of current business processes. Thus the killer apps will be... the same apps we are using today with a touch of AI magic dust. reply mnky9800n 14 hours agorootparentAlso, outside of making chatbots and waifus there's a lot of hard tech problems waiting for ai type solutions. reply chasd00 11 hours agorootparentprevthat's the root of my skepticism. I've yet to see huge transformational projects involving AI from the grapevine of my 750k+ employee consulting firm, all I hear about are experiments, webinars, and POCs. What I see in the news regarding the few projects live is not good, AirCanada and some others where the AI went wrong and now the company has to backtrack. There's no doubt the tech community is all excited because genai, indeed, helps write code but I've yet to hear a large company like Coca Cola announce large AI transformation projects the way they announced large cloud transformation projects a few years ago. I get more and more on the AI bandwagon as time goes on but I still have a pretty healthy skepticism on how deep and wide the tech will penetrate day to day business at enterprises and that's where the ROI is. reply andai 15 hours agorootparentprevWell, the major win will be when AI makes human labor uneconomical. Not sure what that's going to do to the stock prices though... reply JumpCrisscross 13 hours agorootparentprev> All in Podcast Calacanis and Palihapitiya are the Jim Kramers of tech. reply ctrw 15 hours agorootparentprevYes and each of those costs between half a million in pure compute to a few hundred million for fine tuning/training. reply codexon 13 hours agorootparentprevThe open source models are VERY far behind gpt4. reply asimpleusecase 15 hours agoprevhttps://mistral.ai/news/mistral-large/ In fulfilment of some of the comments in this thread meet mistral Large on Azure reply azinman2 12 hours agoprevWhat I don’t get is that mistral is really only possible because of Meta.. and Meta has a user limit on the license. Does that not apply to Microsoft hosting this? Isn’t the economics quite weird here?

But if you look at https://jakeseliger.com/about, there is in fact one! reply panarchy 14 hours agoprevI first thought it would be showing all ideas, about, and now simultaneously, but then noticed all the cards only had /ideas, then I thought I had to do url.com/now only to find that redirected to github instead. Then finally I noticed the little filter button. Kind of feel like the categories shouldn't be behind the button, it's not like they really get in the way visually and with them being the only thing there it feels like just an unnecessary extra click for a common function. /userstory Edit for positivity: It's a cool site though and I'll definitely be checking it out again in the future. reply phgn 14 hours agoparentWe actually had an argument about this and I wanted to remove the filters entirely (since I didn't see a use case for filtering), Louis wanted to keep them. The compromise is the filter button :) I agree that showing all recent posts types would be more expected given the title. But with the stated purpose of the site right now being to \"find people to collaborate with\", /ideas posts are the most useful IMO [0]. And I really want people to write more /ideas pages. Why did you want to see a list of people's /now pages? [0] An earlier version of this site was actually called ideasideasideas.io and had only /ideas posts. But the other content makes the search much better. reply panarchy 12 hours agorootparentI agree that showing... That sounds pretty reasonable! I do wonder though if rewording \"Find people to talk to or collaborate with by searching across the /about, /ideas and /now pages of 7487 personal websites.\" might help a bit? Maybe something more along the lines of \"Find new /ideas to discuss and collaborate on or even search for what's /new with people and what they're /about\" to focus on the ideas coming first and are not just one of the tags of equal importance to search on with the others. Why did you want to see a list of people's /now pages? Just exploratory curiosity (I also tried /about and /ideas, but left that out for brevity). Being pretty unfamiliar with the idea of /ideas and /now pages I just wanted to see what they tended to be like and it seemed like a core part of the website given the name. Given the focus on the ideas part I don't imagine this suggestion to be entirely relevant, but I had an idea about turning your logo header thing that links to your about page (which imo is kind of unintuitive) into the filter. Have it so that that only the current one (or ones?) are colored in and the others are desaturated. And potentially moving the \"building open source, starting a community, etc\" div/search suggestions to show with the hamburger filter button. reply phgn 11 hours agorootparentGood points about changing the intro text, thank you. But from all the HN comments I gather that /about and /now are actually core to the experience too and it shouldn't only be about /ideas... I had the same idea of showing the filter in the header but figured nobody would try to click it :) reply esrh 13 hours agoparentprevIt's also not visible on mobile reply phgn 13 hours agorootparentTrue, I removed it there without Louis noticing :) Why do you want to filter posts by type? reply afrnz 17 hours agoprevLove it - I knew /about and /now but /ideas is new to me. I am adding this to my site as well. Do you filter results based on last update? reply phgn 17 hours agoparentYep at least the /ideas pages that turn up on the page load are sorted by recency. You can also see the most recent /now pages by clicking the filter icon next to the search bar and selecting /now. And we re-scrape all indexed pages every few days. For now the search is purely sorted by relevancy (keyword + embeddings), but it yes would be nice to prioritise recent posts somehow. Since those are much more actionable. reply phgn 15 hours agoparentprevAnd to clarify, we made up the /ideas thing. But IMO it makes so much sense since /about and /now are about the past & present. Because where else do you write about the future? reply jamesdwilson 11 hours agoparentprevThe only thing missing really is a search engine with an LLM. How do you plan to handle our new overlord indexing? reply INTPenis 18 hours agoprevAlso /uses[1]. 1. https://uses.tech/ reply aranw 17 hours agoparentOh nice I really like that.

I personally really enjoy writing and updating my /now and /ideas pages [0], it's quite clarifying to list the things you really care about :) [0] https://lindylearn.io/now reply raytopia 6 hours agoprevA little tangential but is there a good place to share one's personal website? reply bhasi 11 hours agoprevGreat! I don't have an /about or /ideas page, but I do have a /now and a /uses page. https://gurudas.dev I currently only have a short blurb on my landing homepage instead of a full /about page because I struggle with anxiety when trying to describe myself and my journey so far (also impostor syndrome). I like the /ideas page too, but I may not end up finishing ideas if I get my dopamine fix early by publishing them to the world. reply phgn 10 hours agoparentThat's fine, good that we index all three page types. I'm wishing you all the best in San Jose! :) reply bhasi 2 hours agorootparentThanks a lot! I really love this superset of /now pages with your own great idea of an /ideas page. reply KomoD 16 hours agoprevLast I checked bleepingcomputer, ifixit, vibilagare.se, psyche.co and libreboot.org aren't personal sites. None of those actually have an /about page, yet your site says they do... Another funny thing: just search 404 or not found and you'll get a lot of 404 pages reply phgn 16 hours agoparentYes :( Do you have an idea of how to remove company websites in an automated way? I didn't want to manually review all 7k indexed websites. This is the GPT prompt I used for filtering domains to add, but it gives false positives: You are an API. Return a JSON array of booleans indicating whether each provided domain is someone's personal website. Use common sense. Make sure to return false for company websites. reply layer8 16 hours agorootparentMaybe change the API so that GPT can express uncertainty (make it a ternary value or even a confidence percentage), and then check the “uncertain” cases manually. reply tetha 15 hours agorootparentYep, most of our systems end up exposing a parameter like that to the customer. Some people only like the system to take action if the system is very sure, hate incorrect action and prefer unprocessed stuff in a queue. Other customers hate unprocessed items and prefer to cleanup incorrect actions. Takes tinkering to find the best. reply phgn 16 hours agorootparentprevGreat idea, I will try this. Thank you!! reply netghost 15 hours agorootparentprevFor the 404s (assuming the status code isn't a 4xx), use a URL that you strongly suspect won't exist, then you can do a comparison (levenshtein distance, bag of words, etc.) to see if it's very similar to one of about, ideas, etc. pages. reply KomoD 15 hours agorootparent> For the 404s (assuming the status code isn't a 4xx) Most are a 4xx code, I checked myself, some may be 301/302 redirect to 4xx not being handled properly by their crawler reply phgn 15 hours agorootparentGood point. We're using https://crawlee.dev, I think there's a way to handle more status codes as errors...

However, each user's page will be at a path of the primary domain (e.g. example.com/moshe). `/ideas` is not supported at a sub-path (e.g. example.com/moshe/ideas). I will be supporting custom domains, so I could support `/ideas` only for those sites. Other options include redirecting/rewriting your personal `/ideas` path to this product. Or, offering subdomains (e.g. moshe.example.com/ideas) reply phgn 10 hours agorootparentMhh, I would love aboutideasnow.com to be interoperable with your project. Seems like you have more things planned! The redirect option seems good, or supporting subpaths. If there's something I can do to help please write me an email [0] or open a GitHub issue!

And thank you for the shout out of aboutideasnow.com :) Making connections like this is exactly the purpose of the website. reply RamblingCTO 1 hour agorootparentWould love to hear from you! I actually pondered going down that road. There's heavy competition though. Getting LLMs in touch with the web, not so much. So I decided to stay in that niche, as almost all customers come from there as well.

Doesn't aggregation of this type fall pretty squarely with federated/activitypub/bluesky -kind-of-a-thing? It became almost pointless to try to host such a small search/aggregator as a separate web (discovery through web search is almost impossible and it's hard to make people stay on a new website today because of activity sinkholes like twitter/reddit. add to it a hassle of managing modern application at scale etc). I don't know. But I feel that projects like such will have a higher 1yr survival rate when developed directly as a \"feed\".And, AFAIU, that's what activitypub got created for. reply phgn 13 hours agorootparentThat's very interesting...

My thought was that searching would be more useful than a huge list. reply spencerflem 14 hours agorootparentCertainly its not more useful, and ik the pitch for the site is a way to find collaborators which this wouldnt help at all. I just like seeing personal sites in a people watching kinda way. Its neat, and there's usually something interesting there, but I don't really have an objective behind it.

But in this case the date seems very close to the unix timestamp 0 which we use when there's no date found. Maybe it's a local timezone issue... Edit: this should be fixed now! reply city41 17 hours agorootparentOh interesting. I never would have thought AI would be used for this. Does it also find things like the meta \"revised\" tag or anything like that? Doing some Googling it seems like officially it should be \"revision\", but seems like it's very common to use \"revised\" reply phgn 17 hours agorootparentI tried using https://www.npmjs.com/package/metascraper before which I believe does check this meta tag. But a few websites set their updated date to the current date which was annoying, maybe to rank better in Google? And some people (including me) only mention the update time in the page text content. I've used GPT to parse human formatted dates in another project too, it's quite reliable if you validate the output timestamp. And relatively cheap too if you only pass in the first part of the page text. reply city41 17 hours agorootparentI can see how it's a tricky problem. I wish html had more structure here (and people followed the structure, a whole other problem...). FWIW, my page has a \"last updated\" date on its now page but comes up as 1969 in aboutideasnow. Oh, now aboutideasnow shows no date at all. reply phgn 17 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of indexed websites don't have a date unfortunately :( What's your website so I can take a look at the parsing? reply city41 16 hours agorootparenthttps://mattgreer.dev/now It says last updated today because I really did update it today :) anyway, cool project! reply phgn 16 hours agorootparentAhh, I believe we're not trusting the current date at the moment because of spam potential: https://github.com/lindylearn/aboutideasnow/blob/main/apps/a...

    "originBody": "Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live New York medical school eliminates tuition after $1bn gift By Bernd Debusmann Jr BBC News, Washington Watch: Moment medical students find out school will be tuition-free after $1bn donation A New York City medical school will offer students free tuition following a $1bn donation from the 93-year-old widow of a major Wall Street investor. The gift to Albert Einstein College of Medicine came from Dr Ruth Gottesman, a former professor at the Bronx school. It is one of the largest ever donations made to a US school and is the largest ever made to a medical school. The Bronx, New York City's poorest borough, is ranked as the unhealthiest of New York state's 62 counties. In a statement, university dean Dr Yaron Yomer said that the \"transformational\" gift \"radically revolutionises our ability to continue attracting students who are committed to our mission, not just those who can afford it\". Tuition at the school is nearly $59,000 (£46,500) each year, leaving students with substantial debt. The statement from Einstein noted students in their final year will be reimbursed for their spring 2024 tuition, and from August, all students, including those who are currently enrolled, will receive free tuition. The donation \"will free up and lift our students, enabling them to pursue projects and ideas that might otherwise be prohibitive\", Dr Yomer added. Dr Gottesman, now 93, began working at the school in 1968. She studied learning disabilities, ran literacy programmes and developed widely used screening and evaluation protocols. Her late husband, David \"Sandy\" Gottesman, founded a prominent investment house and was an early investor in Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffet's multinational conglomerate. He died in September 2022 at the age of 96. Dr Gottesman said in a statement that the doctors who train at Einstein go on to \"provide the finest healthcare to communities here in the Bronx and all over the world\". \"I am very thankful to my late husband, Sandy, for leaving these funds in my care, and l feel blessed to be given the great privilege of making this gift to such a worthy cause,\" she added. About 50% of Einstein's first-year students are from New York, and approximately 60% are women. Statistics published by the school show that about 48% of its medical students are white, while 29% are Asian, 11% are Hispanic and 5% are black. In an interview with the New York Times, she recalled that her late husband had left her a \"whole portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway stock\" when he died with the instructions to \"do whatever you think is right with it\". \"I wanted to fund students at Einstein so that they would receive free tuition,\" Dr Gottesman said she immediately realised. \"There was enough money to do that in perpetuity.\" She added that she occasionally wonders what her husband would have thought of the donation. \"I hope he's smiling and not frowning,\" she said. \"He gave me the opportunity to do this, and I think he would be happy - I hope so.\" Medical research Medicine New York United States Related 3D-printed breast implants 'could speed recovery' Norfolk No cervical cancer cases in HPV-vaccinated women Scotland Politics More Hope for Gaza ceasefire by next week, says Biden The US president says the warring sides are close to a truce but warns that \"we're not done yet\".

    "commentBody": "New York medical school eliminates tuition after $1B gift (bbc.com)422 points by verve_rat 12 hours agohidepastfavorite265 comments chenxi9649 11 hours agoThis entire story is just so heart warming and I don't know if the title/discussions right now are doing it justice. 1. The fact that this donation is 100% going towards tuition. My university has a few B's in endowment, but those money are most definitely not going towards making the tuition fees lower lol. Hopefully this will allow them to select some candidate that are struggling the most financially... 2. The donor being a 93 year old doctor/alumni of that school that studied \"learning disabilities and developed screening protocols\". 3. The money was from her late husband's \"whole portfolio of Berkshire Hathaway stock\". And before he passed, he told her to \"do whatever you think is right with it\" and the article ends with her saying \"I hope he's smiling and not frowning\". Makes me cry a little. reply madsbuch 2 hours agoparent> ... I don't know if the title/discussions right now are doing it justice. I grew up and did my education in Denmark. Here we have another sentiment on philanthropy than the anglo world has. Generally I don't like when a single person decide the destiny for many people, as in this case. It as anti democratic and concentrates power. Stories like these are heartwarming indeed, but they also help keep status quo. In a more fair world a person should probably not be able to amass more than USD 1B by making the right bet on the stock market. That wealth is build in this way is anti-meritocratic. Stories like this highlight an interesting paradox of the anglo world: The relationsship between democracy and large scale individual impact and the relationsship between allowing people to make their own wealth while the really rich people are merely early, passive, investors. (It is hard to write critical comments like this when \"The donor being a 93 year old doctor/alumni of that school that studied \"learning disabilities and developed screening protocols\".\" - I hope you can forgive me.) reply 4wsn 2 hours agorootparent> In a more fair world a person should probably not be able to amass more than USD 1B by making the right bet on the stock market. That wealth is build in this way is anti-meritocratic. It's anti-meritocratic for someone to invest their money intelligently in the stock market? How do you determine the threshold where on one side they're entitled to the wealth they earned, and on the other side their wealth is unfairly earned? reply madsbuch 1 hour agorootparent> It's anti-meritocratic for someone to invest their money intelligently in the stock market? I like how you threw in the word \"intelligently\" like this investments was planned and thought out from the beginning ;) Thresholds are are not that hard to decide: It is about taxation that takes macro-economic behaviour and targets into account. We have a political party that wants to reduce capital gains tax in Denmark (currently 27%/42%). However, analysis shows that this would benefit only the wealthiest 2% so the consensus is that this is a bad idea from a macro economic perspective. The value of money is relative. Your 1 million dollars are worthless if everyone else has 10 million dollars. The second people act upon and realise that, we can start to build good economic systems. reply JohnKemeny 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's about putting an upper limit to the amount of resources a single person is allowed to amass and thus control. We agree that we don't want a dictator. A single person with too much wealth can be almost as powerful, hence there are good arguments in favor of setting such limits. reply mateo1 1 hour agorootparentprev>How do you determine the threshold I think most people will agree the threshold to be in the few millions. Some will argue for 5 and few for 50, but nobody can produce $1B of value. Take control of it, sure, but produce, no. reply 6510 1 hour agorootparentApparently they can by giving it to the right entity at the right time. What we could do (besides taxing it away) is configure a limit to what they are allowed to do with it. I also see room for special titles with cosmetic privileges if someone accomplishes to pay the enormous tax. It will be hard to find the right privileges. Something like a medal or an outfit is obviously doable. An annual fancy dinner for the group doesn't seem over the top. A daily 30 min slot on the TV for them to bid on exclusively, or each their own slot annually. Can grant 3 lectures in any university. It gets slightly dubious if we add special construction permits for locations no one else may build in. The funniest I could think of, at 10 bl+ we seize all of your money and assets, you are forbidden to participate in the financial system.

If its well earned, so be it. In an unfair world it is taken away from me. It is just numbers. reply kungito 1 minute agorootparent\"Fair\" has many meanings. If there are 2 brothers, one super intelligent and the other retarded, should the smart one keep all his money for himself and the dumb one die from starvation since he is not capable of sustaining himself? The smart one got his gift for free and although maybe he didn't waste it while he could have, the retarded one didn't have equal starting ground. The difference I see between US/EU worldview is that in US the biggest emphasis is in what \"YOU\" did, disregarding luck, chance, environment factors etc. \"Bill Gates created the wealth himself\". People like feeling like there is a chance for them to become super powerful and important and that there is no system holding you back, even though they never actually do it but the hope/idea is very important for you. I can see this in Eastern Europe where large percentage of people dream of winning the lottery; I guess that is something from which people here draw hope of power and influence, while the same people are ok with strong social measures, high taxes, free healthcare etc. while I feel in US all these social benefits are perceived to prevent people from achieving astronomical results and hence shouldn't be. reply madsbuch 2 minutes agorootparentprevThis is unfortunately an uninformed opinion that pollutes the debate. An example you probably should should think about: Who owns money and their value? What happens when the central banks decide to raise the interest rates to 20% and you loose everything? Just a shame? On the contrary, what happens when the central banks employ quantitative easing and that makes you rich? How does this interact with large-scale projects the government starts to create employment. Not always are fiscal and monetary policies aligned. This creates either severe depressions or economic bubbles. When an opinion is funded an understanding of to what extend the greater society defines the value of things it will have gravity. Until then, it is just noise. reply pera 1 hour agorootparentprevI do agree that in a more fair world there shouldn't be billionaires, but at the same time it is curious that from all the stories posted on this website - where billionaires are making uncountable decisions that have a massive impact in our society - this is the only one where commenters would come to express their discomfort towards this fact of capitalism. reply madsbuch 1 hour agorootparent> this is the only one where commenters would come to express their discomfort towards this fact of capitalism Don't conflate an in-equal system with capitalism. That would be untrue and un-wise. Most people agree that a free market needs to exists in order to uphold a capitalistic system (what is ownership if you can not transfer it?). You can make free markets that are regulated in a way that ensures that participants are, roughly, equal - in fact there is an argument that a market is not free unless this is the case. When participants of a market can increase their profit margins it is usually a sign of an ineffcient market - a participant has an advantage that other participants can not compete with. reply nroets 1 hour agorootparentprevIsn't it inevitable that one person will decide the fate of many ? If we get rid of billionaires through wealth tax, then politicians will have more power to decide the fate of many. The US seem to choose their presidents not based on policies or track record but rhetoric. That doesn't seems better than capitalism. reply madsbuch 1 hour agorootparentThe US political system is another discussion. Again, as an EU citizen, the two party system seems to be wildly un-democratic. In Denmark we have 10 parties represented in the parliament (in a country of 5.5million people). This forces decision making to be compromise seeking and represent more real opinions. reply deadghost 8 hours agoparentprevI've currently reading Warren Buffett's biography, The Snowball by Alice Shroeder and \"Sandy\" Gottesman frequently appears. When I saw 2, I thought that sounds awfully like someone I read about in Buffett's Graham group. After 3, it was definitely someone in the Graham group I've read about. The Graham gatherings that included Buffett and Gottesman had fine gentlemen, at least one of which has championed a similar cause in the past, whether that was Gottesman or another one of his peers, my memory fails me. While it's sad to see someone I am still reading about pass away, it's heartening to know that he ended on a high note and that he continues to leave a positive impact from beyond the grave. reply boppo1 5 hours agorootparentAs someone who studied/follows finance, but doesn't work in it, BH is about as 'The Good Guys' as it gets in the investing business.

I see no reason why that should be limited to government; a billion dollars is a lot of power for one person to wield. reply arcticbull 10 hours agorootparent> Those who champion federalism will often say that they believe that government power should be spread as widely as possible; that local control is best because it gives power to those closest to the problems. The counterpoint to this is zoning rules. Sometimes you actually want the people who are furthest away from local problems to set policy. There's no new housing in major metros because wealthy landholders vote in people who set policy to prevent construction. After all, more supply means lower home prices. Setting that policy at the top allows for global optimization - nobody in DC cares that a building throws a two inch shadow over your park for half an hour during the vernal equinox. The reality is both approaches have pros and cons. Ditto with individual direction of funds. There's no reason to think all individual directions of funds are local let alone globally optimal. An individual or two can use their money to halt progress like the Kochs do, and the Murdochs do. This one is great.

If each renter had equal political power to each landholder, the landholders would be a political minority and would not be able to influence policy in this way. When we talk about theoretical improvements to our political systems, it is often useful and I think usually necessary to consider that more than one change would occur at once. If people like where these changes would get us, we can then bring them in to one policy platform and advocate for the change needed to achieve those goals. reply yCombLinks 5 hours agorootparentThis doesn't address people that would move there given an available supply of housing, who have no local voting rights. reply TaylorAlexander 1 hour agorootparentSure. It’s not a complete solution, and there could be schemes to deal with this. But much of the issue with NIMBY-ism comes from the outsized influence of land owners in the political process. Even if outsiders can’t vote, regular renters are more likely to favor building extra capacity than landholders are.

There's the old Churchill quote \"Democracy is the worst form of government, except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.\" Autocracy is extremely effective in some circumstances and absolutely atrocious in most. The public should have some say in expenditures of this size - and if our current government has grown too corrupt to be trusted with that expenditure than that's a separate problem that we also need to solve.

In a society with any modicum of freedom, I should be able to decide what to do with my resources. Why should I (or anyone else) get to weigh in on whether she gives her money to this college or goes to Vegas for a (really amazing) party? As long as she pays her taxes, she should be free to use the rest for whatever she wants. If the issue is whether she pays her taxes, then by all means we can tighten whatever loopholes exist but after all is said and done, people should be able to do whatever they want with their wealth. Also, legislating billionaires out of existence is impracticable. People would simply put their resources into other vehicles that shield against the law. We would end up in a cat and mouse game that used up resources with dubious benefits. reply btbuildem 10 hours agorootparentI follow it partially -- in that when several individuals hoard the majority of money, it leaves less for everyone else, which is profoundly undemocratic in a society that aspires to be market-driven. Money supply is a zero-sum game - yes, you can print more, but that devalues what exists in circulation, so the have-nots remain the have-nots, and the haves remain the haves. I think the existence of billionaires is absurd, and a giant red flag indicating that this in fact is a broken system. No single person should have command over such a disproportionate amount of resources, if only because not a single person can possibly choose well how to employ such resources. Money is violence (in that it compels people to do what they otherwise wouldn't) and billionaires are grotesquely mega-violent individuals. reply Frogeman 10 hours agorootparentMoney supply is a zero sum game... If you only view the game instantaneously. Wealth grows, production increases the wealth of everyone around you. If a few people hoard all of the money, they're not putting that money to useful work and those that do do this will make all the returns (which is why people don't really horde money, it's all being used in the form of investments in businesses). reply takinola 10 hours agorootparentprev> when several individuals hoard the majority of money, it leaves less for everyone else I don't agree with this. Wealth is created everyday. If I start a SaaS business and grow it to become a billionaire, there does not need to be an equivalent loss of wealth anywhere else in the society. > not a single person can possibly choose well how to employ such resources What supports this assertion? Maybe they do, maybe they don't. My argument really is that how you spend your wealth is none of my business after you have satisfied your obligations to society (which we collect through taxes). > Money is violence Hard disagree. Violence is violence. There are lots of ways to compel people to act that are non-violent. Famously, Mark Anthony foiled a coup with a speech. The Pope has enormous influence without having any tanks, etc. I am really against the use of language to make unfounded logical leaps in argument. That said, this is he most compelling argument I can think of ie that billionaires have enormous influence over society. It undermines the concept of \"one man, one vote\". The counterargument is that this concept has never really been true (and cannot be true). All societies have people of influence and that influence is gained in many ways (religious standing, military prowess, good works, hereditary ties, oratory, notoriety, skullduggery, etc). These are intrinsic to human society and cannot be removed. Those people with influence will always have disproportionate impact on the direction of society. I guess it comes down to a value judgement of whether we want money to be one of those things that generate political advantage (for example, most western democracies have removed the ability to wield physical violence as one of those factors that provide a political advantage) reply digging 11 hours agorootparentprevProbably getting too political here but I fully agree.

With free tuition we take away some of the skin in the game, but students will still have to expend considerable effort to achieve high enough grades. That probably fosters commitment (and might explain why people with scholarships still tend to value school).

Or that medical school entrance grades don't require serious study? I can see what you mean about the halfway point. Maybe undergrad came easily, and at the halfway point, the student realizes that medical school simply isn't a good fit, or it's more work than they thought it would be. So they drop out. This is probably a good thing, to prevent people becoming doctors who don't have the chops or the attitude for it. Unfortunately, the school does lose some money on a candidate they ought to have filtered out in the interview.

I can't imagine (but do not know) that it is more efficient to pay claims-made AND tail, versus claims-made with prior acts (unless of course your employer is paying the claims-made). For those not in the medical field, tail or ERP (extended reporting period) coverage is liability coverage for when the original policy has ended - i.e. you were insured for 2024, but in 2025 a malpractice suit comes to you for an incident in 2024. In the auto/general world, this is fairly well accommodated, but in the medical liability world, insurers say it is because of the preponderance of claims that may arrive significantly later than coverage. However, many insurers absolutely ream providers on it. Tail insurance is typically double the actual claim premium, i.e. insurers are saying that your insurance premium is only covering 1/3 of the claims they expect to pay on your behalf. I ... have doubts ... on that number. And I also suspect that there is a bell curve happening where certainly, complex malpractice claims may take time to be built out and filed, and that may extend beyond coverage, but then at a certain point, you can relatively confidently assume that the incoming claims are asymptotically approaching zero. Additionally, I cannot exactly remember if malpractice insurers are required to abide by MLR - profit restrictions - like the 80/20 rule, but in your wife's case, the insurers as a whole (claims-made and tail) are implying that they expect to pay out $168,000 a year for her liability. reply IG_Semmelweiss 4 hours agorootparenther run rate could certainly be 168k . reply MisterBastahrd 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's also why OBGYNs are fleeing red states and some labor and delivery departments at hospitals (see Bonner General Health in Idaho) are shutting down.

You are correct, one of the biggest concerns for physicians is malpractice risk, and thus a big draw for physicians (especially in high risk specialties) is states that have low caps on max malpractice damage awards. I'd say there is a tendency of red states to have lower caps, but it's really a mix. E.g. Texas has some of the lowest malpractice caps, while Wyoming has a constitutional provision prohibiting caps. 2. When it comes to the risk of obgyns, the main fear is not really the cost of malpractice, but it's simply that extremely restrictive abortion laws make it impossible to give proper care. Lots of people, and politicians especially, like to see the world in absolute black and white, but obgyns know more than anyone else that there are a whole host of issues that can cause a fetus to be nonviable, or dangerous to the mother, and laws that protect the fetus above all else are not rationale. Obgyns can fall anywhere on the political spectrum just like the populace at large, and there are plenty of conservative obgyns who are against abortion for moral or religious reasons, but they also know the realities of pregnancy and that many of these laws are simply unworkable. reply MisterBastahrd 6 hours agorootparentYou're missing the forest for the trees. It doesn't matter that some states have caps on malpractice payouts. That's only half the matter. It's the number of times that a doctor has to be sued FOR malpractice, because a lot of those costs are going to be attorney fees. If I were a lawyer in Texas, I'd be posting billboards about specializing in suing doctors for not providing care. When women realize they can win a windfall in court for being denied care with life threatening conditions, they're going to start suing. And winning. Juries love giving away insurance company money. More suits, higher premiums. Since that risk is spread across the state, so is the insurance rate. Most conservative OBs still understand, know, and respect the science.

Certainly there are some countries that probably have similar course of study and requirements as the USA, but I think you would need to approve transfer's very carefully after serious review of the sending countries education and training requirements. NP vs MD education is not even close to being similar - that is why their is no easy path from one to the other - a typical NP will graduate having done ~600 to 700 hours of patient care hours. A typical MD will have had 12,000 to 16,000 hours of patient care experience before they start practicing - there are plenty of things were seeing an NP is more than enough - but you can't just give a few months of extra training to bump an NP to an MD - their education and knowledge is not even close to comparable.

One (not all) aspects of the NP program was similar to your comment, building off career and professional experience, and using that as one basis for knowledge. These programs are not even giving you the RN -student- nursing experience (let alone post graduation), they're skipping that entirely. Looking online: \"Become an NP in 20 months\". \"NP in 27 months\". From HIGH SCHOOL. In EMS, there is a push to make paramedicine at least an associates, if not a bachelors degree (there are programs with all three, certificate, associate, bachelors). Paramedics are the advanced version of when you call 911. The invasive side (versus EMT which is - largely - non-invasive). Cardiac arrest and dysrhythmia management (ECG interpretation, manual defib and pacing, approximately a dozen cardiac drugs), airway management and intubation (including sedatives, paralytics and analgesia), childbirth, trauma, burns. In my area we can give approximately 60 different meds IM, IV, IN, IO from fairly benign to quite acute (adenosine, atropine, etomidate, rocuronium, etc.) The push for this is for at least two years of school, if not four. But yet you have schools pumping out NPs in as little as a year and eight months? With zero field supervision (for better or worse, and with varying degrees of intensity, PAs ostensibly operate under physician supervision/direction). This is going to cause a huge problem, I expect. Not the concept as a whole, but our YOLO attitude to these things, and schools seeing dollar signs. reply ilc 7 hours agorootparentYou will get no disagreement here.

The hurdles I see are: There’s a reason doctors have really intense study time before residency, and you’d have to replicate that. There’s also a reason residency is so intense, you’re not going to get anything like resident experience doing ordinary mid level work. You’d need to hybrid model, but who is going to agree to something like: instead of working as a nurse 40 hours per week, you’re going to work 40hrs/wk and study 40hrs/wk, for 8 years, and if you pass the tests you’ll move on to the next level. This could work but basically sounds like part-time med school. Part time residency would be even less appealing, it would take you like 10+ years to get the amount of cases a resident has if you were only doing it part time reply echelon 10 hours agorootparentThese are fair points. It does sound like a difficult bridge to build. I don't think it would be impossible, but there's clearly a big gap. reply devilbunny 6 hours agorootparentThe bridge is \"apply to, be accepted at, and graduate from medical school\". Offhand, I personally know at least four physicians who were nurses first, and they certainly worked occasional shifts as nurses during med school for extra money, but it's hard to describe just how big of a torrent of information medical students are expected to absorb. There's very little overlap in the education, although former nurses usually have better simple-procedure skills (IV's, catheters, etc.) and superior skills at dealing with difficult patients early on in clinical education. reply fasthands9 10 hours agorootparentprevI agree.

    "originBody": "A bad day at the office Brett Holman • 20 February 2024 • 4 Comments While looking for something else, I came across this rather incredible photo in the Imperial War Museum collection. That's a seaplane stuck 300 feet up a 350ft tall radio mast! If that's not amazing enough, the pilot was rescued by three men who climbed up to retrieve him. And he survived. Here's the IWM's description: A British seaplane, whilst carrying out exercises, emerged from a cloud at high speed and struck one of the masts of a shore wireless station. The mast, which was about 350 feet high, was composed of latticed steel girders and the seaplane's engines became wedged in the interstices of the girders, in such a way, that the body of the machine stuck out at right angles to the mast. The pilot, who was stunned, was unconscious, three hundred feet above the ground. A small party of bluejackets were at work painting the mast, and one of these, a seaman of the Naval Reserve named Rath climbed up the inside of the mast until he reached the machine, and then crawled out to the plane to hold the pilot until help came. Two more men, Ordinary Seaman Knoulton and dockhand Abbott, passed a rope out to him, which Rath secured to the body of the unconscious pilot, and lowered him down to safety. The gallentry of these men is accentuated by the fact that the mast was very badly damaged, and might at any moment have collapsed. The damaged fuselage was only held in a horizontal position by the engine being jammed between the girders, and at the height of 300 feet the wind caused the mast and the machine to sway as if threatening to crash to earth. The pilot owes his preservation to the intrepid gallentry of these three men, who, while aline to the risks they ran, performed the rescue without hesitation for personal safety. Some more information: the crash took place on 14 September 1917 at Horsea Island in Portsmouth Island. The pilot was Acting Flight Commander E. A. de Ville, flying a Sopwith Baby, which you can see a bit better here: Rath was awarded the Albert Medal in Gold, Knoulton and Abbott the Albert Medal.

On top of that, they can only fly that slow straight and level. Banking increases the amount of lift you need to generate to maintain altude, as the lift is now pointing to the side instead of straight up. Maintaining flight in a 90 degree bank is something aerobatics aircraft can do, but it's hard, requires a specific aircraft setup, and you're not doing it at approach speed. More like 100-150mph. Very easy spin an aircraft when attempting to maneuver at low speeds, and that will invariably result in a crash as you need several thousand feet of altitude to recover. Such crashes are 99.9% fatal. Usually looks something like this (Warning: It's a crash, there's a fireball, but it isn't overly graphic): https://youtube.com/shorts/urTs-y7MiJE?si=ovfiC3ZvCgcFr5Nu Rather than just rolling out the pilot pulled back sharply right around when when he got fully inverted, you see the nose quickly start to come around, and then a split second later the left wing stalls deeper at which point it enters a counterclockwise spin and impacts the ground after approximately a quarter rotation. reply imoverclocked 7 hours agorootparentA similar plane, the Sopwith Tabloid had these characteristics:During official trials, the Tabloid achieved a maximum speed of 92 mph, with a stalling speed of 36.9 mph. https://www.ctie.monash.edu/hargrave/sopwith3.html You have a lot of good points above but missed out of a great way to reduce stall speed: less weight! As you burn off fuel or otherwise shed weight, your wing loading decreases and thus you are able to decrease your angle of attack for a particular airspeed. Of course, angle of attack is the key to a stall (and thus a spin) so we can talk about other ways of reducing the angle of attack, often by unloading the wing. Eg: another way to unload the wing is to reduce the tail-downforce that the main wing needs to counter in this classic design. By moving the center of gravity as far aft as is practicable, you achieve the same goal. As with anything in aviation, this is a trade off; By moving the CG aft, you make recovering from a stall harder or even impossible. I imagine that stalling in one of these bi-planes couldn’t have been a benign experience to begin with so, pilot beware! reply TylerE 7 hours agorootparentA pre-WWI single seater aircraft is in no way equivalents.

You know those balls they have on powerlines that flash? Easy right? It's just a flashing light. That's what i always thought at least. Until someone pointed out to me that they sit on one line at a time with no earth and no battery, just a capacitor to store charge between blinks. So how do they create a circuit? There's only one wire! Well since there's current flowing through the wire there's induction and you can wrap that wire in what is essentially half an AC transformer and create a whole new circuit at much lower voltage. In fact the blinking lights on powerlines internally just have two metal plates either side of the slot that goes over the line and clips in. From induction they leach power from the power lines despite there only being one wire and no earth in the whole system. Which i find really cool and simple. You can take any high voltage power line and a metal plate and power a blinking light just by getting close to it! reply samatman 13 hours agoparentIt gets weirder than that, if you bring a fluorescent bulb close enough to high-voltage transmission lines, it will just glow. https://www.farmanddairy.com/top-stories/how-to-make-a-fluor...

In one of the results, the circuit wasn't actually connected end to end so it took them a while to figure out how it worked - turned out the two halves were communicating through induction.

The five separate logic cells were clearly crucial to the chip’s operation, but they were interacting with the main circuitry through some unorthodox method — most likely via the subtle magnetic fields that are created when electrons flow through circuitry, an effect known as magnetic flux. There was also evidence that the circuit was not relying solely on the transistors’ absolute ON and OFF positions like a typical chip; it was capitalizing upon analogue shades of gray along with the digital black and white.\" reply Izkata 7 hours agorootparentYep that's it, I remember this line too: > He also strayed from convention by omitting the system clock, thereby stripping the chip of its ability to synchronize its digital resources in the traditional way. reply KMag 16 hours agoparentprev> You can take any high voltage power line and a metal plate and power a blinking light just by getting close to it!

Ok, I've found a primary source (with bonus photo of Knoulton) that says \"latticed steel girders\" - https://www.alamy.com/1917-daily-sketch-naval-airman-crashes... So I think what must have happened is that the initial 150-foot wooden masts (1909) were replaced with steel masts at some point before 1917, and the first quote above confused the two stages. Ok, yes, found some supporting text. \"The new station at Horsea consisted of 4 wooden aerial masts of overall height 150 feet with 8 'spreader' masts of 60 feet surrounding them. [...] The first station was out of date within 6 years and plans were made for 4 masts of an overall height of 446 feet. The first went up in 1913 to be followed by two more in 1914, the last was not finally being erected until 1921.\" - https://historicengland.org.uk/research/results/reports/7019... For completeness, in this blog post we're back to wood again: \"The masts dominated the skyline and were constructed as a triangular wooden lattice 7 feet each side. [...] By 1933 wireless technology no longer depended on the wooden masts and they were replaced by steel towers of 180 and 100 feet in height.\" - https://manorcourtupdate.blogspot.com/2015_08_01_archive.htm... but I'm inclined to go with the primary source (the Daily Sketch page). Annoyingly, primary sources are thin on the ground - I don't think the accident made it into the papers at the time. Drifting off the topic of the mast itself, I found that Knoulton died in 1981, and a subtly different account of the rescue: \"on 14th September 1917, on Hornsea island a seaplane collided with a Poulsen mast and remained wedged in it; the pilot was unconscious and had been thrown out of his seat on to one of the wings. [Deck Hand ABBOTT Ordinary Seaman KNOWLTON and Seaman RATH], at once climbed up the mast for 100 feet, when one of them [?RATH], making use of the boatswain's chair, was hoisted up by men at the foot of the mast to the place, over 300 feet from the ground, where the seaplane was fixed. He then climbed out onto the plane and held the pilot until the arrival of ABBOTT and KNOWLTON. A gantline was then secured round the pilot who was safely lowered to the ground. All three men were well aware of the damaged and insecure condition of the mast, which was bent to an angle where the seaplane had become wedged. One of the three supports of the mast was fractured, and so far as the men knew, the mast or seaplane might at any time have collapsed.\" - https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/77065-dangerous-perch/ reply flir 2 hours agorootparentAbbott died 1977, and has a wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Abbott_(GC) That's the most complete description of the rescue I can find, and is backed up by other sources.

So one of my personal baselines for physical danger... I've had guns pointed at me a couple times on dark streets, including once by a crazy-overconfident young teen saying he was going to shoot me when I told him I didn't have a wallet (and I had to maneuver as he was saying this, to put a parked car between us, before I sprinted away and hopefully didn't get shot in the back once he could line me up). The other time, as soon as I realized what was happening, I went to an old script for handing over my wallet, suddenly very clear-headed and focused and calm, so much so that the mugger pointing a gun at me started getting nervous and shouting at me. I was wired after both those times, but humans evolved for brief life-threatening stress like that. Job stress is different, and can be worse for humans: * It can be something you can neither fight nor flee. * It can happen over a long period, which we aren't built for. * It can threaten more than just you (your family, your colleagues, strong values). I've had desk-job crisis situations in which the company might rest upon me pulling off something not necessarily possible, when I have to invoke calm, sharp, in-command Astronaut Mode, for days at a time. But IME that only works when you can take some command, which isn't all bad corporate situations. If one has the perspective that the job can't be worse than what they've survived, I suspect that's great, in that it will help them avoid stress adverse impact on their health. Unfortunately, I don't think everyone can have that perspective, and it's also not always an accurate perspective. reply maerF0x0 12 hours agorootparentYou make great points/caveats to what I was identifying.

    "originBody": "🦑 The 14 pains of building your own billing system Billing and revenue systems are a necessity if you ever plan to monetize your business. If you’ve spent any time with them, you know that billing systems are complicated, and no one wants to think about them. When they work, it’s great and everyone is happy. I’ve seen them likened to an octopus, and I fully agree. They touch finance, product, experience, customer support, customers, legal, compliance, sales, and sometimes more. Billing is hard, intertwined, and complicated. Because it’s so inter-connected, it can go belly-up rather quickly if something breaks. And stuff does break. Frequently. (If you have a team that’s maintaining this system and it’s not you, ask them!). Also, if your system isn’t breaking just yet. Give it some time. Look, I know you are busy running the business and you already have lots on your plate. You just want to collect some money and move on to more pressing features that actually matter to customers. But remember: 👉 if you can’t collect revenue legally and correctly, it’ll become your headache and you’ll have more on your plate than you could possibly ever chew 👈 The three patterns This is not unique to billing systems. It is very common to see one of three patterns: Home-grown Full 3rd party system or a hybrid of a home-grown and 3rd party system These all have their own benefits and drawbacks, naturally. Build your own / Home-grown Hybrid 3rd party An entirely home-grown solution. The control is hard to beat. Full control, fully customizable, and you aren’t paying anyone from the outside for fees. Many think (and this happens to many companies) that building and maintaining your own billing system is the best option for your business. A mix of home-grown solutions and 3rd parties. For example, your billing engine is internal, payments are handled by a PSP, and tax compliance by a tax SaaS. Here, you can control the business logic (e.g., when do you update quantities), but the logic is handled by the 3rd parties.A turnkey solution that handles everything for you. All the business logic, payment processing, invoicing, tax compliance, usage, metering – all done by one full-service solution. This is convenient for companies, but you lose a lot of control and may have to shell out a lot of money to get to this place It’s very natural, when you just start your company (or you’re taking your first steps with a new product) to build everything by yourself. You have engineers. You want to keep it very simple. Or so you think. Why not? Because you’re often still thinking like an engineer. You’re thinking of billing as an engineering issue. You’ll say to yourself “why can’t we just dump a file of what we need to bill on S3, and have a CRON job pick it up and collect payment?”. But you’re wrong. It’s a very big and difficult problem, you just aren’t seeing it yet. Here is my very high-level description of the things a typical billing team needs to worry about (YMMV): A typical billing or monetization team has so many responsibilities that it’s hard to grasp even for seasoned professionals. Everyone knows you don’t do your own security (or date handling). You also shouldn’t do your own billing from scratch. via Permit.io My 14 pains of billing and monetization Allow me to list some of the problems I’ve had with home-grown billing systems, from least complex to most complex (partial list!): 1. Idempotency. All requests to do billing, collecting payments need to be unique and idempotent. This will become apparent when you hit API limits and need to retry, or need to spin up more instances of your billing system. Then, you risk double-charging. Luckily crediting/refunding is not a big problem, but this is a problem nonetheless when you scale your infrastructure. 2. Date handling. When do you bill? Every 30 days (calendar), or every month (anniversary)? What about leap days, time-zones, etc? via XKCD: 2687 3. Proration and “leftovers”. Do you prorate on upgrade or only downgrade? Refund? Credits? Ignore it? Block it from happening (don’t allow upgrades/downgrades)? 4. Usage metering. There are dozens of way to decide how to calculate usage, and they can be changed frequently or by customer type 5. Invoice formatting. Sounds easy if you’re operating in one country. But when you expand you suddenly realise you have to collect not just sales tax, but also sometimes VAT and sometimes GST and sometimes additional levies (country-dependant) and you now need individual templates for each market. 6. Complex customer hierarchy. Customers (especially in B2B) could have subsidiaries and partners that they want to manage their billing relationships. How do you roll-up usage up to the paying entity? This is often something that you don’t think about at first, but changes when you grow and expand. Making that even more complex: They could be in different locations, and taxed differently based on their location or where the services are delivered. Then, you are legally required to split the bills/invoices. These rules can also change every few months 7. Payment collection and churn prevention. When do you give up retrying? How do you handle chargebacks (terminate the account, suspend, refund)? 8. Pausing/resuming. What level of access do you let customers have when they pause their subscription? 9. Crediting / refunding. If you always refund the entire amount it may not be hard, but what about partial mistakes? Would you maybe want to give a “store credit” instead of a refund? Should that credit ever expire? 10. Tax handling. You may think different items having different tax rates is complex enough, but these also change frequently if you’re on the global level. 11. Custom deals. If you’re PLG-only this isn’t an issue but if you sign contracts, you will very quickly end up with edge cases and special deals that can’t be easily configured with the assumptions you made. 12. Human error. Customers are often comprised of humans who have made mistakes, and corrections need to be made. Businesses too are comprised of humans, who can misconfigure their customers and then need to make corrections. Crediting and reissuing invoices is a very time-consuming task. This is also true when customer’s legal details change (address, VAT ID, etc.) 13. Selective pricing changes. Pricing changes often don’t affect all customers. When only new customers are affected, you must keep distinct versions of your pricing points to ensure customers’ agreements are kept. @j_poli Should be easy, right!? #startups #tech #developers #siliconvalley #venturecapital ♬ original sound – Justin Poli 14. Revenue recognition and accrued revenue. I can’t even begin to explain this – but here’s a 64 page PDF specification of revenue recognition rules according to IFRS-15. If you understand this – you’re special and please e-mail me, I want to know why. Bonus points if you also did a custom ERP integration 🥲. Why are these hard? Some things change very regularly, more than you’d expect. Some things you only have to do once and never touch again. Idempotency is a great example of an engineering issue that, once solved, rarely has to be touched. However, tax rules change regularly across the world. The more countries you’re in, the more tax laws you have to keep track of. Customer problems around mistakes is a relatively constant issue, but it increases in size as you grow, requiring more customer support and more manual corrections. Let me try and put it in a table. It’s entirely subjective, but it should help explain the relationship between how frequently things change (== break), and how impacted they are by scale. Changes frequently / Impacted by scale 🤏 Somewhat impacted by your scale 📈 Highly impacted by your scale 🪨 Doesn’t change * Idempotency * Dates * Pause and resume rules * Crediting / refunding * Human errors 🦥 Changes sometimes * Proration rules * Customer hierarchies * Usage calculations * Payment collection * Pricing changes 🐇 Changes frequently * Custom deals * Revenue Recognition rules * Tax handling * Invoice formatting My subjective assessment of why some topics are more difficult than others tl;dr: Billing is initially an engineering problem rooted in a very very complex problem space which is really hard to understand even for industry veterans. What should you do about it? Offload as many problems as you can to someone else. Buy something off-the-shelf. Buy as much as you can. I can’t stress this enough. Let Chargebee, Solvimon, Stripe, Recurly, Orb, Metronome, Lago, Togai or anyone else manage your billing when you start. 90% of the “Subscription and billing” section in the diagram above can be handled by any of these. Let Stigg handle your pricing pages, experiments, and entitlements. Let your ERP handle your RevRec/Accounting (or use what’s built in with something else). You should only focus on updating the usage / basic customer lifecycle events, the things that are unique to your product.

Reply Topher 27/02/2024 From the Tao of Programming, 1987: “There was once a programmer who was attached to the court of the warlord of Wu. The warlord asked the programmer: “Which is easier to design: an accounting package or an operating system?” “An operating system,” replied the programmer. The warlord uttered an exclamation of disbelief. “Surely an accounting package is trivial next to the complexity of an operating system,” he said. “Not so,” said the programmer, “When designing an accounting package, the programmer operates as a mediator between people having different ideas: how it must operate, how its reports must appear, and how it must conform to the tax laws. By contrast, an operating system is not limited by outside appearances. When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design.” The warlord of Wu nodded and smiled. “That is all good and well, but which is easier to debug?” The programmer made no reply.” Reply liamcsail 27/02/2024 Very good insight, however, I think that over time, saas product pricing strategy and market competition dynamics will be more integrated, or even dynamic pricing, of course, this may bring unfairness to customers Reply Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

    "commentBody": "Pains of building your own billing system (arnon.dk)332 points by arnon 22 hours agohidepastfavorite196 comments jchw 21 hours agoThis is a great article for people who are in the situation where they have to make decisions about billing and don't have much experience (and as a handy reference for those who do, but want some reminders, too.) However, I will admit, I had a hearty chuckle at this line: > \"why can’t we just dump a file of what we need to bill on S3, and have a CRON job pick it up and collect payment?\" Under no circumstances does my engineer brain think this is a good idea. At all. But, I will dump one aspect of my engineer-brain thoughts: My favorite \"billing architecture\" decision is to try to decouple billing as much as possible from credit in a system. For example, if you have a subscription system where the user pays ahead for a given billing period, I prefer to have the entitlement itself just store the expiration date and the details about what entitlements the subscription grants during the time period it is active. The billing system can store the subscription and sync back to the entitlement as-needed. This makes both manual billing by human operators (not to mention debugging and patching around momentary issues) and something like a Stripe integration very easy. You should, of course, be very careful to leave it open for extension in the future, but this seems to be a very nice decision that doesn't, in itself, limit you too much. Obviously, this is not my original idea, but it's still something I've grown to like a lot, especially after having tried other things less successfully. reply ylere 15 hours agoparentMy experience has been that there are typically two types of engineers: those who have worked on billing systems before and those who haven't. I think a lot of the issues arise from the difference between payments and billing [0]. When just starting out and signing up your first customers, you primarily care about collecting a few (recurring) payments - and it's really easy to set that up with Stripe (or even just manually invoicing your first customers). However, over time, more billing requirements gradually sneak in, such as more complex entitlements, multiple plans, grandfathering, and eventually enterprise/high touch sales customers (where the money is!) who need custom billing cycles, terms, and entitlement provisioning. Since billing is never a technical focus, numerous additions and small hacks accumulate over time, taking engineering resources away from the actual product. Eventually, this turns into an unmanageable mess that can significantly slow down the sales process or limit what you can sell. The complexity of billing is riddled with hidden pitfalls and edge cases, and it has become even more complex now that most plans include many different limits and usage-based components and that most SaaS companies sell globally. Many later-stage companies have teams of 15+ engineers working solely on billing. I fully agree with the author that, unless it's at the core of your product, no organization should build a billing system themselves (Disclaimer: I'm the CTO of Wingback, a SaaS Billing Platform).

Yeah, if that's the model engineer in the \"don't build your own billing system\" mantra then the article had the opposite effect on me. Now I want to build such a system because this made me feel like I'm significantly more qualified than I previously thought. reply jerf 19 hours agorootparentNaw, you still don't want to, at least not in a context in which you're billing enough to be a real workout, because the non-engineering aspects will still get you. Like this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37557989 which, in short, refers to the fact that nobody in the company considers billing a system to be designed in the first place, so it gets approached with a truncated Waterfall that doesn't even have a requirements analysis phase, so you'll have no support whatsoever for your attempt to bring higher quality to billing. Also, with all due respect to those working on billing I have seen that it is generally handed to engineers who are, shall we say, adequate for the task but no more, and unless you're 100% greenfielding you're going to be dealing with their stuff no matter what. From another cynical point of view, it is a situation where you can fail miserably and bring great pain to the company that is traced directly to you, but there is no success; a functioning billing system is just what is expected. It's all downside and no upside for you personally. I have a billing system (a component of the larger whole) and I'm pleased to be able to hand it off next month. I've not enjoyed my stay there. Though it was miles better than when I brushed the data lake/data analysis world. If I had to maintain this system for another few years I could and I wouldn't scream if I had to do it again someday.

It's not meant for product dev, right? It...is? reply specialist 14 hours agorootparentIs \"agile\" meant for product dev? IMHO, no. Very loosely, \"product dev\" projects have concrete deliverables, deadlines, and high cost of change (updates). So therefore are ameniable to PMI-ish critical path like methodologies. (Avoiding the evergreen unresolvable sophistry wrt \"waterfall\".) The original motivation for \"agile\" was to protect the dev team from terrible customers (clients). Those who cannot or will not commit to requirements, actively resist any kind of formalism, have no clue what \"done\" even means. Meaning most IT (data processing) efforts. And now most web stuff. \"Agile\" is totally rational in those unwinnable situations. Because the dev team would always have something to show for their suffering. Lessening the likelihood of being the scapegoat come the inevitable failure. Unfortunately, \"agile\" became a fad, a belief system, an identity. Curtailing any kind of introspection. Only in the last few years have we been able to have calm, frank discussions about \"agile\". Mostly because some of its progenators have broken ranks and done mea culpas. reply robertlagrant 11 hours agorootparent> Very loosely, \"product dev\" projects have concrete deliverables, deadlines, and high cost of change (updates).

Back when we burned CD-ROMs, distributing updates like bug fixes involved non-trivial effort. Today, libs/packages and apps are somewhere between \"agile\" and PMI. FWIW, for web stuff, I'm very interested in \"test into prod\" methodology. Neither agile or critical path; its something new. First popularized by the gilt.com fella (IIRC). But haven't yet found any teams (to join) that bold. reply robertlagrant 58 minutes agorootparent> For APIs, backward compatibility, mostly. But you can still evolve APIs; breaking changes can occur much less than normal changes. And even then you can version them and run old and new in parallel if you want. I don't see why that would be slow. I also don't see why making things in a way that's hard to change suddenly makes something amenable to agile. reply bluGill 19 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is there are a lot of detail that is different just for the sake of being different and those will suck your soul. There are interesting problems in billing. However most of the issues are another government has a law that is essentially the same as every other government, but some small detail is trivially different so you need to figure out which subset of customers that government covers and then apply those details correctly to them. Nothing hard about this, just the same old tax but the details are annoyingly different. Note that you need to get the above details 100% correct in all cases.

Most engineers, in fact, do not want to do this work. It’s like specializing in plumbing for septic tanks, most people have an innate sense of revulsion of self-protection that keeps them from doing it. You screw up the money pipes, and you have a Real Problem. However! The problems are interesting, the challenges are endless, and it’s possible in some orgs to get recognized as the person who is keeping the money flowing. I do have a sense of frustration that every company seems to start off with a bad design for billing, so I’m always cleaning up after negligence… but it pays the bills.

But there is also a long, long tail of boring problems that you won’t have time to do properly. To put it a different way: even after you’ve solved the “mathematical” problems of billing, you still need to solve the operational stuff. Like payments integration, GL integration, invoice formatting, tax, reports, etc etc. I think most engineers underestimate both the difficulty of the “mathematical” problems, and the length of the long, relatively boring tail. reply kkajla 13 hours agoparentprev> I prefer to have the entitlement itself just store the expiration date and the details about what entitlements the subscription grants during the time period it is active. The billing system can store the subscription and sync back to the entitlement as-needed. This makes both manual billing by human operators (not to mention debugging and patching around momentary issues) and something like a Stripe integration very easy. Having worked with SaaS companies using our (Warrant) solution for customer entitlements [0] for the past couple years, this is the approach we arrived at as well (e.g customer stores entitlements in our system and checks against them when needed, adding rules/entitlements as subscriptions are updated/deleted with their payment provider). It makes it easier for companies to work with any (or multiple) payment providers, and there's a clear separation of concerns. Someone shared another blog post by OP about separating your billing and entitlement systems [1] below, but I'll share it here since it's more relevant within the context of this comment thread. I think the ideal entitlement system is (1) dynamic (i.e. rules stored in a database), (2) can handle one off scenarios (for enterprise customers, etc.), and also has a policy layer built on top (so it supports almost any scenario a developer can throw at it -- e.g. pro plan supportsand something like a Stripe integration very easy What I did (and would recommend others do), was a deep dive into Stripes API when designing my schema. It doesn't even cost anything to create an account and run some test charges, refunds, disputes, balance changes, etc. Of course I was modelling a more complicated setup (charges on behalf of customers), but still, useful stuff IMO. If you have access to an accountant / bookkeeper (relative?) that can help too. reply code_biologist 7 hours agoparentprevSpeaking of decoupling entitlements, this article is a classic on that theme: https://arnon.dk/why-you-should-separate-your-billing-from-e... reply doctor_eval 12 hours agoparentprevThe way that we ended up with is similar: - your billing is just a mechanism to compute the invoices. - you accumulate billing using a ledger of invoices sent and payments made (and adjustments, etc) - ie, receivables - you have a set of entitlements, yes - but in the middle you have a policy mechanism that determines when the entitlements should/should not be applied. The trick is that entitlements are not just about billing. The policy mechanism is the “glue” between entitlements and everything else. It means you can give an entitlement to the boss of your biggest customer without it necessarily being linked to billing in any way. reply brettermeier 21 hours agoparentprevIs that legal in germany?

What threat models does AWS server-side at-rest encryption protect against? Someone breaking into an S3 data center and walking off with a box of hard drives? AWS reselling obsolete hardware on eBay and forgetting to wipe a disk? And yet what does it not protect against at all? A misconfigured load balancer that can access 169.254.169.254 and dump your AWS access key straight to an attacker, who can then use it to ask AWS to politely decrypt all of your data. What does it really not protect again? The US.gov issuing a National Security Letter to Bezos threatening jail time if they don't decrypt and hand over the data. To reach the spirit of the \"data must be encrypted at rest\" laws, I believe you should encrypt the data using your own keys which are maintained in an HSM that AWS cannot access. This means that you cannot run your entire stack on one cloud, which would be a huge driver of cost and complexity. reply shepherdjerred 17 hours agorootparent> What threat models does AWS server-side at-rest encryption protect against? A lot of threats. A rogue employee sucking up data. Malware on AWS servers. Not likely, but certainly possible. Server-side encryption is useful, but if you want to be _certain_ that your data is safe, then client-side encryption does exactly what you're asking for. Client-side encryption can use a local key, or a key in KMS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazon-s3-encryption-client/late... Is there a reason you have such a negative take? reply aftbit 13 hours agorootparentYeah I generally have a pretty negative take about tech regulations, especially security ones. They are often written by people who don't understand either the technology or the threats, and are often implemented by people who don't really care about the threats, just about compliance. Client-side encryption is a lot better. If the regulations were drafted in a technology and security aware way, maybe they would include something more detailed than \"data must be encrypted at rest\" which would require such practices. As it stands today, you can be in compliance without actually gaining much in the way of practical security improvement. > A lot of threats. A rogue employee sucking up data. Malware on AWS servers. IMO server-side encryption-at-rest does not protect against either of these, although there might be some edge cases where it does. For example, malware on the S3 gateway would see the data decrypted. A rogue employee with very limited access may be stopped by this, but I would guess that most rogue employees would be abusing the support impersonation processes or would deploy evil code that can access the data after decryption. Client-side encryption would prevent both of these threats as well as the more common ones like losing access to your AWS keys somehow. As long as the method that leaked the AWS key didn't just leak your client-side encryption key as well. All security evaluations should start with a threat model. If you're trying to protect yourself against APTs or nation states, you have a very different challenge than if you're trying to protect against drive-by ransomware. reply actionfromafar 18 hours agorootparentprevEven such an insane design can be made passable, by making the file in-practice-a-queue if you squint. Remove old entries, keep a large margin of old entries. Append new records to the file. Use a counter. (Make it 64 bit if you are paranoid.) On the \"receiver\" end, keep track of what you last saw.

There are of course nowadays so many better ways, but \"real\" and stable systems have been built with such duct tape. reply ivanmontillam 15 hours agoprevI'd argue that the pains of building a billing system are not the right approach to the topic. If building your own billing system is a path so much sought after, well, let that be. Billing systems are of high complexity; I recognise that. However, if Chargebee, Solvimon, Stripe, Recurly, Orb, Metronome, Lago, Togai or anyone else has that body of knowledge, we could instead collect that knowledge in one place. Indeed, there's no better approach than the one that serves you. If you're a subscription-based SaaS, you have specific solutions for your business. If you're a usage-based API, you have specific solutions to the billing. But we could have all that knowledge, approaches, paradigms, programming patterns, better and best practices in one place, instead of discouraging the practice. There are also edge cases where a company is not U.S.-based or European, and a billing solution like Stripe wouldn't work, e.g. your company is based in Venezuela, and you can't have a Stripe account. What do you do in that case? You must forcefully build your own billing solution and connect it to the local payment gateways with their arcane SOAP-XML APIs. -- On a separate note, \"building your own billing system\" reminds me of the topic of \"rolling your own SIEM\" with the typical Elastic + Grafana setup. I don't recommend it, but I understand why it's such a hot path for an IT Security department to do it. reply gopher_space 14 hours agoparentThe article considers billing systems in an interesting way.

I mean, will your customers allow you to shift the burden of responsibility? Is your income important enough to verify? Can you afford the haircut? reply jacurtis 13 hours agorootparentBilling systems are complex... but so are most other SaaS systems. If you take any other SaaS product, it generally seems simple, \"i could build it in a weekend\". But having worked at these \"simple\" SaaS products, there is always a long tail of edge cases that you need to deal with that get deeper and deeper into complexity. That is what these articles about billing systems usually dive into. I agree they exist, but you see this on any system or platform when you start building it for many customers/users. I say this because building your own Billing System isn't any harder than any other platform problem. The difference is that most companies aren't in the business of building a billing system. They could hire engineers to focus on it, and they could build it just fine (it's not THAT difficult). It would just cost a lot of money and all they would do is recreate something similar to Stripe, Chargebee, and the other billing platforms out there, which have already solved these problems for you. These platforms charge you a relatively low fee (lower than the cost of a team of skilled engineers and PMs) to use it, so it doesn't make sense. It's not that the problem is debilitatingly difficult. There is just not enough value in building it when off-the-shelf solutions exist. There are some businesses that might benefit from a custom billing solution because they are too unique to use an off-the-shelf solution. These companies do build their own billing systems and do just fine, but maintain a large team of developers dedicated to the billing product. Examples of this might include AWS with their billing, AT&T or Verizon with their billing, and so on. For most companies though, it would cost far more to build and maintain your own billing system, than it might generate in revenue. Especially relative to just paying a 3% finance fee and getting it \"for free\" with a provider like Stripe or paying a low fee for a wrapper like Chargebee (which charges only $500 for $100,000k in MRR). So if you generate $100k MRR, would you rather go through the headache of building a billing system and spend $50k a month in a small team of engineers to maintain it, or would you rather just pay $500 for essentially the same thing with no headache? THe choice seems simple to me. So it's not that Billing Systems are hard... they just don't make sense to build. Any competent engineering team could solve the problems from a billing system, it just isn't worth it. reply doctor_eval 13 hours agorootparentprev> There are topics presented as problems that I'd hand off to accountants or other specialists we're probably already employing.

The accountants already have jobs to do and billing is not one of them. > They're less complex than whatever your developers are working on I worked on billing systems for a long time. They are definitely more complex than whatever your developers are probably working on. It’s all in the article. Just take proration.

It gets worse when you’re working with public companies. I’m sorry but your replies are the typical “billing is not that hard” of an inexperienced engineer, posted to an excellent article explaining exactly why billing is hard. reply trollied 11 hours agorootparentI have worked in billing for 20 years. Each country has its own laws & quirks. Things like having to issue corrective invoices instead of refunds/adjustments in some countries. Others require document numbering to be sequential in different ways (by customer, period etc). Rounding is another fun thing - want that done at an invoice level, line level? Up or down? Taxes are not fun, especially geocoded US taxes. You've got a leased line with rented equipment at both ends - Which of these is the service address for tax purposes? Both with different rates? Something else? I could go on. Just when you think you've learned it all, another crazy requirement pops up. You're correct when you say people underestimate the complexity. reply doctor_eval 5 hours agorootparentYes exactly. The thing I learned is that it all has to work independently, then you glue it together with policies. Even the simplest hard coded decision is going to be wrong in some context. Even with such an approach, you’ll still miss something, but at least policy mechanisms provide a pattern for refactoring and new features.

And what time zone is the user in? Is the user part of a group billing scheme that is billed in a different time zone? Or do you bill everyone in the same time zone regardless of where they sign up? You need to know this in order to compute both \"n\" and \"m\". Do you need to break the billing into separate line items, for example, a service component and an entitlement component? What about addons or powerups? Are they all prorated? are you sure? What about fixed up-front charges? Surely these are not prorated? Do you charge in arrears or in advance? If you charge in advance, how many days/months in advance? If in arrears, when do you actually raise the charge? You need to know this to compute \"m\" and \"n\". How do you remember to pro-rate it? Bonus question: what's the process you use to ensure that arrears charges are always raised? Not a cron job, surely? Is your billing cycle even monthly? Could it be quarterly? Weekly? Annual? Do you need to prorate entitlements? What about quantity entitlements like download volume? What about fixed entitlements like per seat licenses? Do you prorate to the millisecond, or the day? Is there a minimum proration period? Are there any accounting rules related to proration in the accounting regime of the user being billed? If you provide a signup bonus or coupon that exceeds the value of the prorated first billing period, how do you apply it to the account? Ok. That covers the stuff I can think of off the top of my head. There are probably just as many questions that I’ve forgotten. Ultimately, the problem is not determining how to prorate, since that's a simple ratio. The problem is to work out what \"m\" and \"n\" even means, and to compute their values in a way that works within the policies of the business you're billing for. And even a simple business will change requirements over enough time. Then, of course, there’s dealing with things like refunds and cancellations. Which, in my experience, everyone gets wrong and pushes off to manual processes. And then there's the other 12 things in TFA, each of which has at least as many twists and turns.

This is the system that lets other people get commission based payouts for sales within your platform. You need to track affiliate codes back to sales and a user, handle sending payouts to an affiliate at their configured payment provider and if you want to go all out then handle metrics around visitors and present a UI to the affiliate so they can see their conversion rates and payout history. Fortunately most of that can be built incrementally. As long as you associate a unique code to a user and wire up associating that to a sale with a specific commission % amount everything else can be done manually or skipped. For example I pay affiliates out once per month where I goto Zelle or PayPal and send out the payments. It takes less than 10 minutes. There is no front end for tracking conversions and it's also never been a cause of someone saying they don't want to be an affiliate because of that. reply mattbee 21 hours agoprevI don't know about this advice, you ain't gonna need half the features it talks about, and you absolutely can build it out gradually as your business grows.

The biggest mistake I see companies making is not properly appreciating the fact that there is in fact 4-5 entirely independent business processes going on inside that monolithic concept they refer to as a \"billing system\", and they REALLY need to be kept seperate. IMO the fundamental seperation that is absolutely critical to make is distinguishing between your \"entitlements system\" that tracks what SKUs you offer and which customers have what SKUs (and in what quantity), the \"accounting system\" that takes input from the entitlements system and tracks the over-time net balanced owed by the customer, and finally the actual \"billing system\" which periodically takes the balance from the the Accounting system, zeroes the account back to nil, and generates an actual point in time \"bill\" for the customer to pay.

When you get big enough, you need to be able to match any money that lands in a bank account with a given invoice/billing entry. You need to be able to detect any invoices that do not have a paired bank statement line.

These limits and flags are attached set on \"plans\" which can be attached to accounts. Plans can be combined, in which case we'll take the larger value for each numerical value and combine the tags using union. Additionally one can override / add to any of these values on a per-account basis, so if your customer needs PlanX but a custom API quota then you just override that single value directly on their account. Call me old-school, but I don't get why something like this should be outsourced to a third party. reply baq 18 hours agorootparentIf you already have a process for repackaging entitlements in plans and addons whenever some bright mind in marketing has an idea, the it’s completely fine. reply jdwyah 18 hours agorootparentprevyeah, the overhead of another system for people to understand is non-trivial.

Do each of those plans map directly to a sku that they are paying for? reply LeFever 18 hours agoparentprevI'm actually working on a solution to plan entitlements among other similar functionality right now. While you can get a basic solution set up with feature flags, we've found that the organization and evolution of billing/pricing-related entitlements (E.g. plans, editions, etc.), especially over time, is increasingly complex with lots of requirements in the peripheral. Think things like varying combinations of feature, seats, and usage-based/metered strategies, team subscriptions, plan migrations, one-off enterprise plans, multi-subscription customers (E.g. promotion periods and layered subscriptions), usage aggregation, automated upselling, etc. As you show in your blog (Nice post btw!), while you can have a flag with a numerical value representing a limit, the infrastructure for tracking usage is left to the business to implement. Imagine instead that you emit usage of that lever to an entitlement service and entitlements based on that usage are updated in real-time, even across teams. Also imagine that you have other entitlements that may be dependent on that entitlement that update as well. In addition, as limits are approached or crossed, you can choose to have soft enforcement (I.e. let them continue, but notify sales to reach out) or hard enforcement and display a prompt to upgrade. In the spirit of OP's link, we work alongside existing billing solutions rather than try to reinvent the wheel there.

Specifically for real usage based systems, how do we get these limits to apply all the way down to our API rate limits / filters?

Curious if you've thought much on how to distill feature-flag entitlements, service-limit entitlements, role-based entitlements, billing-based entitlements, and so on to a single interface like \"Can I [action]?\" Edit: Ha, just saw your reply in a separate thread. Yes, you have thought about it. :) Would be curious to learn more. reply jdwyah 16 hours agorootparentSo yeah, some assorted thoughts: 1. Some of these are primarily updated in a UI, some are driven from some other system. Flags are customer UI, but Auth is often customer's customer (admins setting RBAC) or derived from SAML Role / etc. 2. There are very different personas / different blast-radiuses for different changes. This means that there should be different interfaces for the creation and administration of the different type of things. 3. Different scales. Dynamic configuration / feature flags are great, but you don't want the rule payload to be GB, which you would have if you tried to store fine grained permissions inside it. Zanzibar is awesome and should be available to more people. 4. It would be best if we could all agree on the names & types of these objects. I think schema files and code-generation are underused. 5. My inclination is that entitlements are just feature flags under the covers, but that there's enough different that a custom UX is warranted. 6. It's easy to add a ton of latency to applications with this stuff. First we spend 50ms getting the user... then we go get the billing for 50ms... then we get the entitlements for 50ms... There are big gains to be had by having this solved holisticaly. hmu anytime jdwyer at prefab.cloud would love to hear your thoughts. reply LeFever 2 hours agorootparentSome of these immediately resonate.

(6) is what got us thinking about this idea of distilling entitlements in the first place. Will definitely reach out. Thanks! reply jschorr 15 hours agorootparentprev\"Can I [action]?\" is the exact question that Zanzibar[0] was designed to answer in a highly performant and scalable way. With multiple data sources reading and writing to SpiceDB [1] (our OSS implementation of Zanzibar), those questions can further be extended into \"Can [subject] [action] on [resource]\", which allows for supporting not just permissions, but (as you suggested) feature flags, entitlements, role-based access control and even billing-based entitlements (if the billing system's information is supplied in as relationships or dynamically via caveat context [2]). As a concrete example, feature flags can be represented as a straightforward permission: definition user {} definition featureflag { relation enabled: user permission is_enabled = enabled } They can then be checked directly: check featureflag:somefeature is_enabled user:{currentuserid} The real power comes into play when different aspects of the system are combined, such as only allowing a feature flag to be enabled if, say, the user also has another permission: definition organization { relation member: user } definition featureflag { relation enabled: user relation org: organization permission is_enabled = enabled & org->member } In the above example [3], a feature flag is only enabled for the specific user if they were granted the flag and they are a member of the organization for which the flag was created. While this is somewhat of a constructed example, it demonstrates how combining the models can be used to grant more capabilities. With caveats [2], these kinds of questions can even depend on dynamic data, such as the time of day, whether the user's account balance is positive, or even be random based on some distribution (to enabled, for example, partial enablement of feature flags) [0]: https://zanzibar.tech/ [1]: https://spicedb.io [2]: https://authzed.com/docs/spicedb/concepts/caveats [3]: https://play.authzed.com/s/eML6cLz9ByAZ/schema Disclaimer: I'm CTO and a cofounder at AuthZed, and we build SpiceDB reply LeFever 2 hours agorootparentThis is cool!

We ourselves, in fact, use SpiceDB for our own dynamic feature flags internally. reply ylere 14 hours agoparentprevI think as long as \"feature flag entitlements\" are seen as distinctly different from what engineers usually use feature flags for (small incremental changes of individual components, testing, roll-outs, A/B testing) they can work well. An entitlement should have a clear link to a customer-facing feature, which are conceptually much larger blocks of functionality. One difficulty with this approach is that you still have to take into account a lot of billing-related aspects, e.g., handling customers in arrears, overage charges if they go over a certain limit, having different pricing models for the same feature, or resetting/carrying over usage counters on plan changes/upgrades - this can add a lot of complexity over time! That's why we decided to offer separate feature entitlements that are tightly coupled to the billing chain and metering as part of Wingback (disclaimer: I'm the CTO). In the end, depending on your plan complexity and how much you have already invested in feature flags, I think both approaches can work well. Having some kind of feature gating in place for your customers will also make your life a lot easier for provisioning customer accounts and being able to offer custom packages. reply aftbit 18 hours agoparentprevFeature flags are one of those beautiful systems that are just expressive enough to be shoehorned into doing everything. Beta rollouts? Role-based auth? Billing entitelments? One-off customer requests? Yes. They can all be feature flags. The very best feature flags can optionally have a value attached to them. Then your API plan limits can just be feature flags. Now... is that the best way? Probably not, for any one of those use cases.

Being the founder of a feature flag company I feel like I'm a rope dealer. I'm really interesting in providing good authorization primitives as well.

You're going to be tempted to do some weird un-holy things. If you can use one provider for it, then we can really help when it comes to putting things in the right place.

Perhaps the general case of X is enormously tricky and complex, but in my use case I only need to handle a specific subset of the complexity. Therefore I can build my own solution that only handles the complexity I need, and it will be much simpler than off-the-shelf tools. I absolutely adopt this stance for X=datetime. My approach to datetime requires two function calls to be provided by the library: convert an epoch time to an ISO formatted time string in a particular TZ, and the inverse.

Building a billing system is indeed quite complex, and for a variety of reasons: For once thing, most departments within the company will be impacted (finance, accounting, product, engineering, legal, ...), so the cognitive load on the team building the solution is quite high, and requirements are usually poorly defined. Then, as mentioned in the comments above, there are tons of complicated use cases and edge cases (time zones, pro-rations, entitlement v.s. billing, in-arrear/in-advance models, usage-based, credits, coupons, tax integration, refunds, chargebacks, and on and on ...). Another aspect is that once you have built the billing system, this is just one part of a bigger quote-to-cash picture, and the solution needs to fit within the rest of such platform, so it needs to be made flexible enough to integrate with such systems.

Some are even trivial. However there are so so many constraints one has to keep track of so system complexity quickly snowballs into something unmanageable. Each cog is simple, but the whole clock is insanely complex. And by the way, the clock can't stop and has to be running 24/7/365 while you keep changing it. Your code will quickly turn into a tangled up mess of stinky petrified spaghetti, so you will end up re-building your entire system from scratch every few years. And with each rebuild you will keep having the same trivial problems you already solved again and again and again. Billing problems in general are a subset of problems one has in banking because banking system basically = billing + interest calculation + payments + accounting + multiple equally complex things and it has to work in real-time in a super-regulated environment while working in perfect sync with other systems you don't control. If you do everything just right and manage to keep the can rolling down the street for sometime, there will be a moment when regulation changes or your business changes and your architects suddenly resign and you will end up with a mess which requires more engineering dollars than off-the-shelf system would. Don't build your business on such foundation. It is XXI century already, no need to re-invent stuff which is readily available for peanuts. Yet, every new neobank comes up with their own shiny corebanking ledger because they can't be bothered to look into somebody else's petrified spaghetti. reply bearjaws 20 hours agoprevWorked for a large travel website that rolled its own billing... Absolute nightmare when we blew up, had to hire 6 people to beef up the billing side of the website and it definitely cost us way more than those 6 people due to mistakes.

A team that thinks it's the right thing to build their own billing system lacks the experience and knowledge to do it correctly. reply wolfspider 16 hours agoprevI built one for the government keeping track of licensed professionals and receiving their payments for things reported in the field (mobile first web app). It collected over a quarter million dollars in 30-40 dollar payments with different tiers, refunds, overrides, and even penalties for non-payment all while being PCI compliant. One thing that helped a lot- create an auth system that lets the admin impersonate the customer to walk them through it. It’s a tough paradigm to start with but pays off immensely. Another was generating excel files and reports on demand from any view of the data in the app. One of the developers on the project implemented a simple state machine for payment histories and stored it in a number of tables with FK constraints. Do not do this! That means in the future your app will need to deserialize every customer’s history and after a few years the app will grind to a halt. This was the one issue with the app looking back. A state machine looks like a good fit for billing but if my future self could go back in time and warn everyone it would be with this one common problem or I wouldn’t even make this comment in the first place. If you do consider using a state machine just create thousands of customers with long detailed histories up front and if you can load them all up quickly then that is a good sign. Your billing system will only perform as well as you can transform and index data from customer history in bulk. reply godzillabrennus 19 hours agoprevI helped build a billing system for a smallish family business.

You really want to have \"the order\" as static as possible, for \"the invoice\" there is even legal obligation. Then it goes something like... I bought 5 and got a discount but I want only 3 and ohh there is a typo in my name and one in my address - sorry about that. No problem, you credit the invoice, make a new one for the same amount with the name and address correction, then you wait for the items to be returned and checked and credit it again, make a new invoice again. The return shipment stays in limbo for a while, they order 5 more, one arrives broken, they want a refund rather than a replacement. With 2 delivery dates the system doesn't apply the 5+ discount.... and all of a sudden you have tons of transactions and \"paperwork\" for what you initially imagined to be 2 simple orders. They also forgot their password so they made a new account using a different email address. Looking over the logs a year later it is hard to figure out why they got a discount for just 3 units. reply wdb 18 hours agoprevCan't be worse then needing to change a SAP system to work with the business processes than instead what is the cheaper and quicker way of changing the processes to better match SAP.

There are reasons why companies implement software from Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, including that it's better to reduce costs on things that don't differentiate you in your market (and it's nice to have someone to \"pointedly talk at\" when things go wrong). reply rahimnathwani 11 hours agoprev\"Let your ERP handle your RevRec/Accounting (or use what’s built in with something else).\" With that approach, how do you: 1. Make your ERP recognize revenue correctly? An ERP system isn't magically going to know how your revenue should be amortized based on certain events, or what should happen when a partially-amortized order is later upgraded/downgraded to a different package/plan. 2. Ensure that your refund/upgrade/downgrade calculations are consistent between product systems and the ERP system. Even if you emit all the necessary events (and each contains all the necessary data), there has to be some system that's programmed (or, at least, configured) to apply your revenue recognition rules to the event stream. Given how much difficulty people have even describing how things should work, I don't think you can just abdicate the revenue recognition to another system and just assume whoever configures/programs that system will do it right. Even if you can assume that, it's equivalent to saying \"it's complicated so you shouldn't do it yourself; have someone else do it\". reply zengid 16 hours agoprevI'm on the billing team and we just shipped our new platform send me your regards! reply zie 18 hours agoprevMy rule of thumb: Always ask about rounding. If they don't have a sane answer, it's basically guaranteed that their system is broken in countless ways. Pretty much the only sane answer: Until you realize that every jurisdiction, bank and organization you interact with financially can and might round pennies differently, you don't understand financial systems enough to implement one. i.e. rounding is configurable or you are doing it wrong. reply gizmo 17 hours agoparentWhy does rounding matter? It's not important from an accounting perspective. And your billing system doesn't need to angrily send invoices when a customer owes a penny. reply zie 16 hours agorootparentFor accounting, if your auditors and accountants don't care, I'm jealous. I've never met one that doesn't care. reply gizmo 15 hours agorootparentTax laws were written for cash businesses where the cash in the register never 100% matches the sum of receipts. What matters in my experience is that your books are balanced, but there is no such thing as \"perfect accounting.\" In the real world inventory goes missing for reasons unknown (broken, stolen, never delivered properly) and as long as you've got an entry in the books that plugs the hole it's fine in practice. Accountants and auditors don't do forensic investigations, not even for publicly listed businesses. I have never met an accountant who cared even slightly even about very significant tax compliance issues. Businesses don't want to change their sloppy ways either. They want to make money first and let the accountants clean up the mess later (impossible). reply zie 13 hours agorootparentWe are talking about very different things. You are talking about mistakes that happen, sure that happens, write-offs of inventory or what have you obviously happen in every organization. We lose track of things, it happens, it's fuzzy. All accountants get that. That's not what I'm talking about at all. I'm talking about rounding math. If you always round down, and I always round up, and then we supposedly have 50M identical transactions, what is the likelihood that we are even in the same ballpark? fairly low. There are even many movie and TV shows involving rounding get rich schemes, including Superman: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/14925/has-a-pro... When you are talking about millions or billions of dollars, a rounding error can account for significant sums of money. When you and your bank are off on how much money you supposedly have by 6 or 8 figures due to rounding, you absolutely better care. The US has no consistent rounding laws for accounting, but the EU has a consistent rounding rule around the euro. The EU has an entire paper around rounding the euro available here: https://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/pages/publ... The US basically shrugs and makes no ruling, because if you ever go interact with many different banks, you will find out that they don't all round the same. Also you might find the wikipedia page interesting: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding There are plenty of rounding options, and sometimes figuring out how an organization you interact with decided to do their rounding can be a fun exercise :) If you know anything about dealing with money in computers, you know that floating point math and money math are completely incompatible, so you have to do decimal math to deal with money. This is like engineering of financial systems 101. Rounding math is financial systems 201. reply gizmo 10 hours agorootparentWe’ve processed millions of dollars and we have never encountered any sort of rounding issues. Our numbers always match to the penny. Yes, banks do all sorts of rounding internally, but this doesn’t affect us. We get detailed transaction statements from the bank (correct to the penny) that contain amounts, currencies, fees, interest, settlement dates and everything else. We take that data and match it to our invoices. The bank’s numbers are authoritative. We don’t know what spot forex rate the bank will use for any given transaction. We don’t know what fees we get charged. There is no such thing as a disagreement with the bank about how much money we have. Our bank accounts were empty a decade ago. Sum all transactions between then and now and you end up with our current balance, to the penny. There are some edge cases, where for instance your quarterly numbers are reported individually (and therefore rounded) but the annual report uses unrounded quarterly numbers but this is all pretty straightforward. Unnecessary complexity would lead to rounding footguns, but money in my world is discrete and fixed precision (just like physical). reply zie 10 hours agorootparentThen you won the rounding lottery. It's great that you and the bank each round the same way. Also I'm jealous you only have 1 bank to deal with. We have many banks we do business with, one of them rounds differently than the rest. It was fun to figure out how they rounded :) Even more fun altering our software to round differently for transactions involving that bank. reply gizmo 9 hours agorootparentI can imagine it's a real headache. Maybe I'm surprised because our bank just doesn't do any rounding. It's all fixed point math. Except for fees, but we don't try to reverse-engineer that black box algorithm :) reply zie 5 hours agorootparent> our bank just doesn't do any rounding. It's all fixed point math. I promise they and you round. As I linked above via Wikipedia, there are many rounding strategies. From what you describe, I'd guess they are Rounding toward zero, i.e. just truncating all digits past 2 decimal places, which is a very reasonable rounding strategy for banks. reply whydoineedthis 20 hours agoprevI know the founders of bunny.com (which tries to solve this very problem). They sold a different b2b startup after 10 years and billing was such a pain they created a whole nother startup just to try and solve it. Lol. reply baq 17 hours agoparentDon’t know about them but they surely aren’t the only ones. It’s a proper mess. reply jongjong 10 hours agoprevI think a lot of the problems which companies experience are all related to them not being able to find good software engineers. The amount of money I've seen startups forking out annually for various billing and platform subscriptions would have been enough for me to build them a better system from scratch in under 6 months. The amount of money that companies waste on rents is ridiculous and it's sad because that money could have gone to skilled engineers instead of hotshot entrepreneurs. For my own SaaS startup, I built the billing system from scratch, it measures every millisecond of CPU time and every operation used by each account and adds them to the current active bill. At the end of the month (or whenever), I manually trigger a process to close off active bills and the system will automatically display that one as due in the UI and will open up a new one and new usage will be recorded against that new active one. The trick is to use a function which automatically figures out what bill to use based on a specific flag so you don't need to worry about the implementation details of which bill to record usage against. This function should handle all possible situations; including the few milliseconds of delay which can exist between the old bill being closed and the new bill being opened. That's where idempotence can be useful as mentioned in the article; that way if the system fails to record usage against a new bill because (for example) that bill was already just created concurrently by a different process then it will retry again later and record the new usage stats against that existing bill. The trick I use is to have deterministic IDs for bills that are based on the nearest whole unit of time in UTC (rounded up or down); the amount of rounding I use allows me to control the allowable delay between concurrent processes and determines the amount of pending usage data which is kept in-memory within each process before it is flushed to its bill in the database. If the chosen unit of time is a 'whole minute' then it means that it's not possible to generate two bills within 30 seconds of each other by concurrent processes. This is greater than my database update timeout so it effectively guarantees that two processes cannot accidentally create two bills for the same period. If a specific process took longer than 30 seconds to update their usage info, that process would reconnect and either realize that an active bill has now already been created by a different process or, if not, it would try to create it again with a new ID corresponding to the new 'whole minute'. I have full flexibility to change my billing to any time interval I want. It doesn't even have to be the same for all users. Anyway, as you can see, it's very simple. reply coolThingsFirst 15 hours agoprevSeems simple enough for a startup idea but prolly has been done thousands of times reply 6510 18 hours agoprevI haven't really explored it but one idea I had (for small volume) was to make everything manual data entry then put suggestions and warnings with the form fields. Even if you perfect automation there will be exceptions and mistakes made. By doing it manually everything also gets reviewed. reply zackmorris 15 hours agoprevThis is why I'm so disappointed with Stripe. I found the documentation both overly verbose and lacking, so it took me longer than it should have to understand basics like subscription item ids and the 50-100 id types which people have collected into lists. Then there are simple bugs like how the go live button only shows in test mode, with no simple way to copy live mode data back into test environment(s), so developers have to manually export/import stuff that business people set up in their attempt to save time. The most basic features are missing, like a way to copy any object as json from the browser dashboard, forcing us to look down in the logs/events to copy the latest version, often with wildly inconsistent/unpredictable formats. And Stripe does little to support actual real-world use-cases, for example: subscription events come through webhooks ok, but subscriptions have a state like \"active\" or \"incomplete\" (meaning that payment hasn't gone through yet), causing subscriptions to become stateful. Meaning that instead of a user being subscribed (yes/no), the app has to consider additional criteria and edge cases around missing or lapsed payments. And there doesn't appear to be a synchronization mechanism for eventualities like a backend server being down for a day, causing events to be missed. Stripe does a best-effort resend some low number of times, but then the events are lost. It's up to the developer to diff the backend's database with the Stripe subscription list and then sync individual subscriptions manually. These are all just exactly the kinds of bugs/features I predicted would be there before I used it, which is why they felt like such a slap in the face. I suspect that there are conceptual shortcomings throughout nearly every service provided by Stripe, and I'd be over 50% confident that any ones I predict here would be found upon first use. These are artifacts of favoring agile over waterfall for formal engineering challenges. Basically what I'm saying is that I consider the Stripe API to be what an MVP payment processing system might have looked like back in the 1990s under older paradigms like SOAP/XML. But nobody has created a wrapper for Stripe yet that works how people expect, more like Venmo/PayPal that maps customer use-cases to CRUD operations.

I did not remember it like that.... Ok something must be very wrong here !! What happened ? It has to do with the production access pipeline and how they are used by the engine. When Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud were done crafting all the graphic files, they used a tool (IGRABed) to pack them together. The output was made of 3+2 files. VGAHEAD.WL1 VGAGRAPH.WL1 VGADICT.WL1 The VGAHEAD file is an index containing pointers to the VGAGRAPH where the data is stored huffman compressed. VGADICT contains the huffman dictionaries to decompress the data. The two other files produced: GRE.H GRE.EQU Are compiled into engine as seen in the following drawing : What are the .H and .EQU files needed for? In short, to allow access by name. When IGRABed assembled all files it would also create an enum with matching indices: GRE.H enum{ H_WOLFLOGOPIC GETPSYCHEDPIC L_GUYPIC . . } graphicnums GRE.EQU H_WOLFLOGOPIC = 0 GETPSYCHEDPIC = 1 L_GUYPIC = 2 This way when the engine requested a particular asset, it could use a logical name (L_GUYPIC) instead of a \"magic number\" (2). That means the engine shipped with the indices of the images in the VGA files HARD-CODED. Since the assets and codebase evolved after shipping wolf3D shareware (with Spears of Destiny), the newly compiled game indices do not match the location in the original assets files. Running the game (again) Fortunately there is a simple solution to this problem: Somebody regenerated the VGA assets so they match the indices in the .H and .EQU released with the source code.

One thing from back then that I really miss is how easy it was to do some complex things. I was able to draw to the screen by just calling geometric shape functions, and it made pictures! I found out that if I drew a shape, then called the xor function on the shape a new but sligtly different shape, I could make animations. So making little sprites that looked like they were running made out of only 1000 lines of C++ code was awesome. Some friends and I we got together and made a final fantasy like game using these tricks, hand crafted sprites and a game world that you could walk across, every map was a whole screen, and you would go to an adjacent map when you hit the sides, and every step if you had a natural 1 you would go into a fight with some enemies. This was all pretty tedious and everything, but it was a lot of fun to high schoolers. And if we knew more computer science and software engineering we would have done more probably, and it would have worked better. But unlike today we didn't have to learn SFML or or activex or opengl to just start playing and get stuff working, we could just call circle. reply xyzelement 19 hours agoparentI suspect that if we wanted to find an environment for kids to do simple shape programming, we can find something like that. The difference seems to be that there's been a greater divergence between \"professional\" tools and \"kids/intro tools\" whereas Turbo C++ (or Turbo Pascal in my days) were kinda both. reply ecshafer 19 hours agorootparentThere has been a lot of effort put into making kids versions of technology, which I think is probably the right move for elementary school aged kids. But once you get into middle and highschool, I think as a kid there is a \"coolness\" factor to using the same stuff that the pros use. Since at that point you are trying to be an adult, you are trying to do stuff the right way, and hey you might be getting a real job in the field just a couple years anyways. So there is some value I think in making just more friendly of an environment and on boarding process to a tool. reply josephg 13 hours agorootparentprevWhen I was teaching programming my go-to was the JavaScript canvas api. It’s 2d only, and very simple. And being on the web once a student has made something we can host it for them and they can show their friends. I have a ~20 line html harness which sets up a page with a full screen canvas element and gives you global window width & height variables. That’s all you need to get started. And it’s real JavaScript - so students learn a useful programming language as a result, and the advanced students can go nuts and add sprites, sound and networking if they really want to. reply xyzelement 8 hours agorootparentAny chance you have an example of what you are talking about reply josephg 7 hours agorootparentYeah this is the template I use. As I say - its like, ~20 lines of boilerplate: http://josephg.com/canvas_f.zip I tell people to leave the html file alone and edit the javascript, using the canvas API to make it draw whatever they want.

So if anything making \"simple sprites\" has become a bit easier since you can just think of any composited surface as a more generic version of a hardware sprite. reply ecshafer 18 hours agorootparentI think this is more simple from the pov of making a game engine from scratch or a game with complex effects and graphics. But is it more simple from the pov of a high schooler that just wants to get some flat colored shapes on the screen? reply zozbot234 18 hours agorootparentEven rendering \"flat colored shapes\" efficiently can be a bit non-trivial if you expect pixel-perfect results, like you'd get by plotting to an ordinary framebuffer - the GPU's fixed rendering pipeline is not generally built for that. The emerging approach is to use compute shaders, and these are not yet fully integrated with existing programming languages - you can't just edit ordinary C++/Rust code and have it seamlessly compile for CPU and GPU rendering. But we're getting closer to that. reply hnthrowaway0328 8 hours agorootparentprevI'm curious how does the texturing work in the SDL backend? I did not read the code but am curious now.

Thankfully a professor pointed us to XEmacs, which I managed to get my Borland experience back, which became my UNIX companion until KDevelop, Eclipse, Netbeans came to rescue. reply qingcharles 15 hours agorootparentprevMy first real IDE and still my favorite IDE. reply zackmorris 16 hours agoparentprevOne thing from back then that I really miss is how easy it was to do some complex things. This might be my biggest disappointment with \"modern\" programming. I want direct access to the hardware with stuff like $100 1GHz 100+ core CPUs with local memories and true multithreaded languages that use immutability and copy-on-write to implement higher-order methods and scatter-gather arrays. Instead we got proprietary DSP/SIMD GPUs with esoteric types like tensors that require the use of display lists and shaders to achieve high performance. It comes down to the easy vs simple debate. Most paradigms today go the \"easy\" route, providing syntactic sugar and similar shortcuts to work within artificial constraints created by market inefficiencies like monopoly. So we're told that the latency between CPU and GPU is too long for old-fashioned C-style programming. Then we have to manage pixel buffers ourselves. We're limited in the number of layers we can draw or the number of memory locations we can read/right simultaneously (like how old arcade boxes only had so many sprites). The graphics driver we're using may not provide such basic types as GL_LINES. Etc etc etc. This path inevitably leads to cookie cutter programming and copypasta, causing software to have a canned feel like the old CGI-BIN and Flash Player days. Whereas the \"simple\" route would solve actual problems within the runtime so that we can work at a level of abstraction of our choosing. For example, intrinsics and manual management of memory layout under SSE/Altivec would be substituted for generalized (size-independent) vector operations on any type with the offsets of variables within classes/structs decided internally. GPUs, FPUs and even hyperthreading would go away in favor of microcode-defined types and operations on arbitrary bitfields, more akin to something like VHDL/Verilog running on reprogrammable hardware. The idea being that computers should do whatever it takes to execute users' instructions, rather than forcing users to adapt their mental models to the hardware/software. Cross-platform compilation, emulation, forced hardware upgrades that ignore Turing completeness, vendor/platform lock-in and planned obsolescence are all symptoms of today's \"easy\" status quo. Whereas we could have the \"simple\" MIMD transputer I've discussed endlessly in previous comments that just reconfigures itself to run anything we want at the maximum possible speed. More like how a Star Trek computer might run. In practice that would mean that a naive for-loop on individual bytes written in C would run the same speed as a highly accelerated shader, because the compiler would optimize the intermediate code (i-code) into its dependent operations and distribute computation across a potentially unlimited number of cores, integrating the results to exactly match a single-threaded runtime. The hoops we have to jump through between conception and implementation represents how far we've diverged from what computing could be. Modern web development, enterprise software, a la carte microservice hoards like AWS that eventually require nearly every service just to work, etc etc etc, often create workloads which are 90% friction and 10% results. Just give me the good old days where the runtime gave us everything, no include paths or even compiler flags to worry about, and the compiler stripped out everything we did't use. Think C for the Macintosh mostly worked that way, and even Metrowerks CodeWarrior tried to have sane defaults. Before that, the first fast language I used, called Visual Interactive Programming (VIP), gave the programmer everything and the kitchen sink. And HyperCard practically made it its mission in life to free the user of as much programming jargon as possible. I feel like I got more done between the ages of 12 and 18 than all the years since. And it's not a fleeting feeling.. it's every single day. And forgetting how good things were in order to focus on the task at hand now takes up so much of my psyche that I'm probably less than 10% as productive as I once was. reply zozbot234 15 hours agorootparentMicrocode? I don't think that's how modern μarch works. You can definitely make modern compute accelerators more like a plain CPU and less bespoke, and this is what folks like Tenstorrent and Esperanto Technology are working on (building on RISC-V, an outstanding example of \"simple\" yet effective tech) but a lot of the distinctive featuresets of existing CPUs, GPUs, FPUs, NPUs etc. are directly wired into the hardware, in a way that can't really be changed. reply a-dub 9 hours agorootparentprevsounds like you want transmeta and the jvm to have a post-oop baby that natively understands matrix and vector math, simd and massive parallelism. reply aidos 22 hours agoprevAfter seeing it mentioned on here a bunch of times over the years, I finally read Master of Doom a couple of months back.

The concern was that developers who had just ascended the Win16 API learning curve would now have to ascend another totally different learning curve to understand the framework. MFC developed from a (supposedly) nice object oriented framework into a way to avoid explicitly passing handles to API calls. (It also replaced message cracking and a few other things.) By the time Visual C++ rolled around, Microsoft started adding higher level abstractions to MFC and building it back out a bit, but the underlying damage was done. > And to this day Microsoft hasn't been able to deliver a C++ framework that is as nice to use as those from Borland.

ATL was and is, anything but nice, unless one is into deep love with COM without tooling, to this day Visual Studio still doesn't offer anything to alleviate the pain of dealing with COM, IDL and generating C++ stubs, because just like MFC and Afx, it seems there are many internal feuds against having nice tools. The only time Microsoft finally created something nice to use COM from C++ (C++/CX), those internal feuds managed to kill it, replace it with a developer experience just as bad as ATL (C++/WinRT), and then when bored left the project to play with Rust/WinRT. reply datavirtue 11 hours agorootparentprevMFC completely turned me off of Windows programming until WPF was released.

This is a fork of doomgeneric, which itself is a fork of fbDoom - but midway through I noticed that all the abstractions added by fbDoom and doomgeneric are actually not very helpful for a WASM port that should run in browsers, and that I probably would have been better off forking the original source code instead): Github repo: https://github.com/floooh/doom-sokol Hosted version: https://floooh.github.io/doom-sokol/ reply ndiddy 18 hours agoparentprev [–] Despite your lack of interest, other users on the site may want to compile Wolfenstein.

I'd propose what I find to be a bit more useful, a website that compares a bunch of different travel eSIM providers: https://esimdb.com No affiliation from my side. I find it nice to know I always have many options. reply kotaKat 20 hours agoparentI'll throw this in as well -- https://esim.me/ It's not an \"eSIM\" per se, but it's a physical SIM card that has the eSIM module onboard. This lets your physical devices use eSIM providers. One weird thing they do though is a strange licensing model where you can buy the physical card locked to one specific phone, one specific brand of phones, or any phone, plus a set number of eSIM slots. The Omni/15 is the \"best\" of them all. You DO need an Android device to be able to set the active carrier; however, once the active eSIM slot is set you can pull the SIM and put it in something else and use that selected carrier. reply YoumuChan 19 hours agorootparentIt is just an standard eUICC card with an issuer certificate, which means you need issuer's app to access low-level eUICC functions on a rootless Android. This is how esim.me enforces the subscription. This also means, you can use any LPA implementation to manage and install profiles on your own! Some examples: https://github.com/Truphone/LPAdesktop Needs a smart card reader and a pc to work https://github.com/estkme-group/lpac Could either use a smart card reader or an actual modem with AT-support https://gitea.angry.im/PeterCxy/OpenEUICC Needs a root on Android Furthermore, I believe you could manage it via Windows settings if your window laptop has a WWAN card. reply joecool1029 14 hours agorootparent> https://gitea.angry.im/PeterCxy/OpenEUICC Needs a root on Android It usually needs to be priv-app installed, which means you have to build it in with the rom or add it with a Magisk module (don't use the one on github though it's horribly out of date, if you must... make sure your device is in light theme mode or you won't see the QR code and confirm buttons). reply kotaKat 18 hours agorootparentprevWhat eUICC physical cards are people grabbing for this? reply joecool1029 14 hours agorootparentI can confirm esim.me works for it, it's just expensive for one of them. This service does not require an IMEI pairing to the EID because at least in the US it's using T-Mobile (at&t has a device whitelist and verizon requires a valid IMEI/EID in their database). reply schrmh 13 hours agorootparentThat's interesting cause on a a bigger german website we are trying to figure out how to get that firsty thing working with removable eUICCs since Feb the 16th. The only person that reported there that eSIM.me is working for them used a smartphone with a built-in eUICC for \"looking at the app and receiving activation code\" and after that put in the eSIM.me into a Galaxy S10. Everybody else that wrote something about working or not working — no matter if they use products from eSIM.me, 5ber or sysmocom — wrote that it isn't working for them. Even when installing the profile with the static activation code from within the APK — that can be found when using apktool on the APK and a bit of grep — I wasn't able to get a data connection with the profile deployed to the sysmoEUICC1-C2G. Btw. firsty seems to use Vodafone here. However, firsty support answered today that they \"are looking into support for these use cases, so stay tuned!\" reply riedel 14 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately it does not work with firsty, but it works like a charm with arbitrary esims while travelling. I last used it in Japan but also sometimes across Europe if I need extra data. I am super happy. Also with their support! reply kefyras 10 hours agorootparentprevWhat's up with KYC \"in accordance with German and European regulations\" to use it? A number of EU member states don't require any id/registration for prepaid (e)SIMs. How is that any of their concern if you're buying a profile from a 3rd party? reply ossguy 14 hours agoparentprevDoes it show eSIM providers that explicitly do not provide phone numbers? In particular, ones whose eSIM does not list any phone number that the OS can see (many \"data-only\" plans still have a phone number the OS can see/use). The closest I found on eSIMDB was a \"Hide data only plans (no Voice / SMS)\" option, but that's sort of the opposite. I'd like to see \"Hide plans that have a phone number\" for example. Mainly I ask because Apple-using friends of mine have told me that it's impossible to remove (e)SIM phone numbers from the iMessage database. There is apparently no setting to use to prevent Apple from making a (e)SIM phone number an option for iMessage, so it's important to have (e)SIMs that provide no phone number at all, to ensure that iMessage can't get confused about which identifiers the user actually wants available. reply brnt 21 hours agoparentprevFirst plan I check is no longer offered though. Second is more expensive. I guess these things tend to go out of date fast... reply 4ad 19 hours agoparentprevMost eSIM providers are just resellers, what I care about a travel eSIM is: 1. is it a reseller, if yes, from whom? 2. does it have local breakout in the target country? 3. what network does it use in the target country? 4. is it data-only? 5. does it allow tethering? 6. can I pay with Apple Pay? 7. can I use it without an account? Very, very few eSIM services fulfil the second criteria above, and no comparison website I know off lists all the others. Without LBO, an eSIM is worthless to me. Thus far, I have only found Truphone and bne to have LBO (at least where I travel to). I would love to hear about more options. No LBO no buy! reply AlexAndScripts 19 hours agorootparentWhat is local breakout? reply 4ad 19 hours agorootparentIt means routing data to the Internet directly through the network the user is using rather than going to the operator's network. When normal roaming, even though you use some local network, all the trafic gets tunnelled out from the local network to your own network provider, to the internet, and then back. So if you're from, say, France, and you visit Australia, all your traffic gets tunned back and forth to France. This is bad. Most eSIM providers work like this, usually tunneling through Israel or Poland. With LBO you get direct Internet access just like you would with a local SIM. Basically you need LBO to avoid a VPN connection to some random far away country. reply AlexAndScripts 13 hours agorootparentThanks for the explanation, that's really useful. I'll keep it in mind when travelling. I'm curious, why Israel and Poland? Are a lot of eSIM providers from there? reply dataflow 18 hours agorootparentprevHow do you tell if an eSIM has LBO? Also, is this specific to eSIM somehow? Shouldn't physical SIM behave the same? reply 4ad 14 hours agorootparentPhysical SIMs behave the same, but most people use SIM cards from specific countries rather than global SIMs, which are a niche business product not oriented towards consumers. When you use a local SIM card you (almost?) never get LBO. Note that sometimes this is a feature, e.g. you can sometimes get internet in China this way. The point, however, of eSIMs is to be \"better\" than your home SIM. eSIMs usually offer a better price than your home SIM (while travelling), but they rarely offer better performance. In fact they often offer worse performance, because they often have a single POP in some weird country that is further way than your home country. Global SIM providers, both physical SIM and eSIM have more POPs, often in the country you are travelling, or at least closer to it than your home country. Until recently these providers were out of reach of most people, since they did not sell directly to consumers, but now some of them offer eSIM, albeit at a higher price than the competition. To answer your question though, unless the eSIM provider tells you under which conditions it has LBO, you can't know except experimentally, but that test has to be done from a specific location. They might have LBO only from some countries or from some network. For example, now I am in Austria and Truphone seems to be routing through Germany, which technically is not local, but it's still far closer than Israel or New Zealand (!!) that some cheap eSIM providers go through. bne seems to route directly through Austria though, beating Truphone in latency and even beating my local SIM in latency. The good news is that many resellers cheaper than Truphone are actually using Truphone's backbone, but unfortunately they don't advertise than making it really hard to shop around without burning money for tests. YMMV though. reply dataflow 4 hours agorootparentFascinating, thanks! The NZ thing sounds wild. reply thworp 18 hours agorootparentprevDo you have some references for the local breakout thing (preferrably technical docs/spec)? Seems like it would not be in Telcos interest to saturate their interconnects needlessly. reply jerbear4328 23 hours agoprevThis seems pretty cool, so it's free slow cell service in exchange for watching a video ad every hour, with optional prepaid plans for higher speeds/no ads. It does seem that your cellular is only active for an hour after you last watch an ad, which is unfortunate if you want to receive notifications throughout the day. reply throwaway81523 23 hours agoparentHow does it know that you watched the ad? Does it quiz you or what? It actually sounds terrible. I can get a minimal prepaid sim for $30/year (200MB/mo + basic voice and text) and that sounds preferable to this thing with ads. https://www.ebay.com/itm/133196831828 reply oarsinsync 23 hours agorootparentThe eSIM offered works in multiple countries. The eBay listing is limited to the US. This is a similar thing that is comparable to your eBay link, but also doesn't feature roaming. 100MB a month for 5 years, for £16 one off: https://www.rwgmobile.wales/webshop/buy-forget/5-year-sim-da... reply chaboud 21 hours agorootparentThe cohort Venn diagram is world travelers who can’t afford a global service? People who can pay for a flight but would rather watch an ad than pay for service? And the value of that ad inventory of people unwilling to pay is? I’m all for the effort, and I am fond of business models that more directly convey the revenue from ads to customers, but I have some concerns for this business. It all could fade pretty quickly. reply lakpan 18 hours agorootparentThat would be me. I can change country with $60, it doesn’t mean I’m willing to pay $10/MB. I usually can get internet service for $10 or $20/month locally. If I haven’t sorted out an eSIM before landing, it means I’ll be without internet until I go through customs. Airport WiFi isn’t at all a guarantee. What happens if I really need internet? e.g. some overzealous immigration officer really wants to see my hotel reservation or my return flight ticket. I’d love to have a service that guarantees I have at least messaging in 60 (ad) seconds. reply chaboud 18 hours agorootparentThat seems like a bit of a strawman, honestly. The era of $10/MB international roaming faded back in ~2015, effectively crunching the demand for global roaming WiFi hotspot rental. Current pricing is somewhere around $10/day for 5-10GB for that model. For US customers, T-Mobile US went to included global roaming at EDGE speeds (email, messaging), and Verizon is at the other end with $10/Day for 2GB at high speed (dropping to “3G” speeds after that). Any business jumping into this space has to contend with that pressure and assailability, possibly relying on less-lucrative advertising bases of users outside of North America, Western Europe, etc. That doesn’t make it impossible, but I’d certainly be interested in the upper and lower estimates for the business potential. It just strikes me as a business where the network operators are really well-positioned to extract potential value while optimizing for the defense of their position. And when it comes time to re-negotiate terms, if this business is successful, network operators in regions with insufficient competition will be able to put the squeeze on, possibly forcing unworkable costs or loss of customer trust. I hope this works out for them, for the reason that I also think that basic connectivity should be available to all, always, but those are the business concerns that immediately come to mind. reply logifail 20 hours agorootparentprev> The cohort Venn diagram is world travelers who can’t afford a global service? People who can pay for a flight but would rather watch an ad than pay for service? At this point I laughed, as I don't have global service, yet have flown round the world in the last fortnight. > And the value of that ad inventory of people unwilling to pay is? Yeah, I'm never going to click on your ads. Don't build a business model on me! reply chaboud 18 hours agorootparentDon’t get me wrong. I don’t think it’s nonzero. I just don’t know if it’s enough to overcome the tonnage cost (bulk rate for IOT/B2B cellular), and the business development challenges for global cellular and advertising are no joke when we’re down to a freemium-ad-supported revenue model. Striking at the eSIM moment is a slick move, though. This would likely have been a hard non-starter in the physical SIM era (which still applies in some cases). reply jerbear4328 16 hours agorootparentIsn't physical SIM cards like what TextNow is doing? https://www.textnow.com/wireless You can buy a SIM for $5 and get a free phone number that you can only use in their app, which has ads. I know plenty of people who that service could be very useful for, $5 one-time for unlimited text/talk, if inconvenient. I do think that using Firsty and Google Voice together could accomplish the same thing for free, except Firsty's unlock-for-an-hour model means you can't receive messages when you haven't watched an ad in the last hour, so maybe TextNow still has some use. reply logifail 17 hours agorootparentprev> Striking at the eSIM moment is a slick move, though I bought two data eSIMs to cover my trip - each one only covered one specific country. To my frugal mind it wasn't worth paying the extra to upgrade to a 'global' data eSIM just to cover the handful of additional places I was in transit through (and turned out I had ready access to free wifi in those places anyway). reply happymellon 19 hours agorootparentprevThat's a pretty interesting deal for something that doesn't need to transmit a lot of data, but will need to do it long term. 100MB/month attached to a Pi that has data for 5 years for only £16 looks to me like a great deal for an active monitoring site. reply scosman 19 hours agorootparentprevYou expect too much for free. This looks amazing. Keep it installed, use it when I land (even if just to buy a better eSIM from Airalo). Don’t need to plan ahead, shop eBay, carry extra sims around. If I cross the border for an hour (live in Canada) might just use it for texts/slow web, or pay $2 for a day. Connivence factor is amazing. reply diggan 23 hours agorootparentprevIt seems like it's your network provider so they have access to your network activity, seems like enough to know if you've watched a video or not. And sure, you can pay and get a better experience, but not sure that's a fair comparison, this is free after all. If you can't afford to pay anything (sometimes people end up in shitty situations), then maybe watching a video for free internet isn't that big of a deal, when the alternative is no internet at all. reply rglullis 21 hours agorootparentUnless this company is targeting the \"homeless people who are denied entry at public spaces\" market, how hard is it to get access to a free wifi hotspot? Also, if you are such a bad situation that you can not afford to pay for phone service, what is the point of having this offered as a global solution? Seriously, what is the audience here? reply diggan 21 hours agorootparent> Unless this company is targeting the \"homeless people who are denied entry at public spaces\" market, how hard is it to get access to a free wifi hotspot? There are plenty of places where there are no \"free wifi hotspots\", like many places that fulfill the extreme \"not a city\" criteria. Maybe it looks differently where you live, but if I go with my car one hour inland I'll end up in places where I'm sure I wouldn't be able to just find free wifi hotspots everywhere. > Also, if you are such a bad situation that you can not afford to pay for phone service, what is the point of having this offered as a global solution? I don't know, ask the company if they're planning to offer a global solution and if they say yes, ask them why? Not sure how that's an argument against the service in the first place... reply rglullis 19 hours agorootparent> if I go with my car one hour inland I'll end up in places where I'm sure I wouldn't be able to just find free wifi hotspots everywhere. What is the intersection of people who \"have a car and are able to drive one hour inland\" and \"are so cash strapped that will subject themselves to a 'free' phone service that makes them watch ads every hour\"? Also important: who would be interested in advertising to these people? reply diggan 18 hours agorootparent> What is the intersection of people who \"have a car and are able to drive one hour inland\" and \"are so cash strapped that will subject themselves to a 'free' phone service that makes them watch ads every hour\"? I'm talking about the people who live in those places already... The part about \"if I go with my car\" part is just to help you visualize that there are places outside of cities. reply rglullis 17 hours agorootparentAgain: what is the TAM for this, and if you are talking about North American exurbs/rural areas, why is this being marketed for international travelers? What I am trying to say is that, while I am certain that you can fund this useful for a segment of the population, how big this segment needs to be in order to become valuable for (a) advertisers and (b) investors willing to sink money into it? reply universa1 21 hours agorootparentprevhaving this as a backup sounds nice to be honest. getting a sim card in the traveled to country was sometimes a bit of a hassle in the past... nowadays probably not so much. anyways, this might provide the time to get a sim card locally, as those often times used to be a lot cheaper, than some travel sim... and also might provide different coverage provider / network wise, depending which network they roam on... reply Kudos 23 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't supposed to replace your domestic carrier. reply kristopolous 23 hours agoparentprevOtherwise people would use it for IoT infrastructure. I certainly would. reply michaelmior 21 hours agorootparentI haven't actually made use of this yet, but Google Fi lets you purchase additional data-only SIM cards for $5 or $10 and then the data gets billed at $1/GB at the same rate without any minimum. So if you're only sending a few KB a day, you pay almost nothing. reply devmor 20 hours agorootparentDoes the price for 1GB apply if you use only 50kb of data during the billing period or is it prorated? reply gooseyman 19 hours agorootparentI had fi for several years. IIRC it was billed as $.01 per megabyte. If I used 341MB, my bill was $3.41. I think you would still pay for the full MB though. reply michaelmior 18 hours agorootparentAs a current Fi customer, I believe that's correct. But I think this is also aggregated across all devices. So if you use 1KB on 5 devices, I think you only pay $1. There's also a limit of 4 data-only SIMs. reply devmor 18 hours agorootparentprevGood to know, thanks! Probably not something I’d want to use for a super low bandwidth application like hourly gps updates but definitely viable for something a little more “active iot”. reply liftm 20 hours agorootparentprevGuess my IoT devices will have to learn how to watch videos. reply FloatArtifact 12 hours agorootparentThat's what I was thinking :) reply progbits 21 hours agorootparentprevAre there cheap LTE+ embedded modules that support eSIM? All the ESP32/Arduino boards with mobile data that I've used in the past required a physical SIM card. reply universa1 21 hours agorootparentmhm, at least for older phones there is stuff like: https://esim.me/ no clue if it works to set the card up in a phone and then use it in a board?! reply landgenoot 19 hours agorootparentprevnrf9160 reply fullstackchris 23 hours agorootparentprevThat's exactly what my mind jumped to when seeing this (free IoT!), can almost expect someone will try to build some sort of automated video watcher to work around this caveat and abuse it :) reply kristopolous 23 hours agorootparentthat's fine. small abuse isn't worth the cost to enforce. abuse at scale, however... reply rubyfan 21 hours agorootparentAround 2000 there was a dial-up service called Juno. It took about 15% of your screen to show a rotating banner ad and had some time limit for use. As far as I recall every restriction was implemented in the client. As such there was a really easy workaround to connect directly without using their software and bypass every restriction. A guy I know used that workaround and at some point got a letter in the mail from them because he was in the top 1% of users of the service which was very costly to them so they terminated the account. My hunch is even small scale abuse of a system can have a big effect. Even if it seems small it still might be impactful. reply philistine 17 hours agorootparentWe weren't technically savvy at all, but still found a loophole. There was a version of the software that crashed after you had successfully connected. As long as you didn't update, you were ad-free. reply brnt 21 hours agorootparentprevReminds me of free dotcoms back in the late 1990s just up until the dotcom bubble burst: free but with a frame with a banner. 14 year old me enjoyed learning how to load (and then design around) my own page in that frame. reply kmu526 20 hours agorootparentprevJuno was great. There was another company similar to Juno with the same idea which I think started with an \"N\" if I remember correctly. My dialup of choice was MetConnect. It was entirely free and fast no ads just dial in and use the Internet. reply terinjokes 20 hours agorootparentNetZero, who eventually bought Juno after they went under in the dot-com bubble. reply daveloyall 19 hours agorootparentI set up a local BBS-like system and used the real NetZero* dialer to call it and attempt to log in. Then I changed my password and repeated the process several times. That gave me the key to the Caesar cipher they used for the password.. so I could create a fresh account with a scrambled password any time I wanted. At runtime, in the OS-provided ad-free dialer, I'd use the unscrambled password. I also pre-created some accounts with unscrambled passwords like \"apple\" and \"bicycle\" to share with friends. NetZero* ceased operations mere weeks after I started this.. Hm. (* Was it NetZero specifically, or some clone? I forget..) reply vachina 23 hours agorootparentprevThis infra would probably last a week max. reply miki123211 22 hours agoparentprevI wonder how this works, if your cellular gets deactivated, how do you inform the service that you've watched the ad? Particularly if all you have is an app with no access to low-level system APIs like USSD, texting etc. Is it just disabling your access except to a particular IP range and then enabling it back on receiving a HTTP request? Can routing in Telcos even work like that? Or is it DNS perhaps? That would seem to be the easiest layer to implement this on. I'd really like a technical explanation here. reply mbreese 22 hours agorootparent> Can routing in Telcos even work like that? Why not? I don’t know how this company actually has things setup, but I suspect you’re right — it’s all done with routing tables. DNS tends to cache too much, and I think DHCP would either be too chatty or also cache too much to be used as a gate keeper. Instead, a firewall/routing approach would make more sense. It would technically be no more difficult than setting up port knocking. Instead of pinging a specific port, you’d watch a video. But other after that, you could just route traffic. What I’d be more interested in knowing is where this filtering is taking place. It would be better done on the phone, to avoid null-routed data going over the network (and costing $/€/etc). So, I’m guessing that it is all done within the eSIM app itself. Maybe something like getting a (signed) token after viewing the video that extends a time limit/expiration for the eSIM itself. Then when the eSIM is expired, it can only communicate with one service — the ad host. reply __jonas 22 hours agorootparentprevI'm assuming this would be done by zero-rating their advertising service. They already imply that they restrict traffic on their Free plan to certain services so I would assume they use the same mechanism to allow traffic to pass through their advertising service even when a users free plan has run out. Here is a paper on how websites could be identified for zero-rating: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343966537_Knocking_...

There are some technical nuances to how you handle DNS and also redirecting from other web pages (if desired) without breaking things. But that’s the gist of it. reply worewood 21 hours agorootparentprevAs a citizen of a country where prepaid access is the norm, it's just DNS (mis)redirection. People call it \"captive portal\". When your quota runs out everything you access resolves to the same address, which is an internal web site where you can buy more data. And yes, it does not work if you use a custom DNS such as Cloudflare or Google Public DNS, or if you try to reach a HTTPS page. But they don't care, as it's a minority that does this. Android already has support for captive portals, and shows a notification when it detects one. reply projektfu 20 hours agorootparentprevVarious providers seem to allow access to their sites when the SIM card isn't set up yet, so you can set it up.

Nobody is forcing you to use the app, though. What do you mean by infrastructure cost not being important?

I had created that Google Voice number back in the day when those SIP apps were a thing which offered you a second number. (I lived in India back then and still am). I wonder whether there's an international eSIM that I can have without paying a regular \"keeping the SIM alive\" fee or paying a really really low free and recharge it whenever I want to actually use the data or SMS or calls when I need it which is usually when I travel?

Through what was definitely a configuration error on their end, my eSIM stopped working after I added more data to my plan. So for a week, I went from WiFi to WiFi in contact with their support, while they kept asking the same questions over and over again. Is roaming on? Yes. Have you entered the correct APN? Yes. Have you tried all providers? Yes. Is roaming on? Yes ... Eventually I called for a refund and they denied it because, despite not ever loading a single website successfully on the new plan, I had apparently consumed ~10KB. I saw some Reddit users reporting similar issues with their support. So if you run into issues, I would recommend calling for a refund immediately rather than trying to get it fixed. There are more than enough similar providers. I switched to getnomad.app after that. reply gizmo 22 hours agorootparentI'm a happy Airalo customer. But also, I don't expect to get any customer support from low margin convenience services like these. If my eSIM stopped working for whatever reason I'd just shrug and buy a new one. Why fight with some underpaid customer support agent when there are sights to explore... reply SebastianKra 21 hours agorootparentIn hindsight, that's definitely the lesson I've learned from this. But let's be clear: My issue isn't that their underpaid support staff didn't know what to do, it's that they apparently don't have the policies in place to just say \"f* it. We don't know whats wrong. Let's refund or issue a new SIM\". That would have been cheaper for everyone. reply doix 22 hours agoparentprevI wish the prices were even remotely competitive, every time I check and compare, it's always _significantly cheaper_ to just get a SIM locally. I just checked Morocco, and it's $31.50 for 5GB. I think I paid 7$ for 20GB or something. Then again, I have a phone with a regular SIM card. Maybe the prices are comparable if you have a new iPhone with no regular SIM slot and are forced to use an eSIM. In my mind, eSims should be cheaper, since there's no physical component there, but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case. reply aembleton 19 hours agorootparentI think that's country specific. For example, for Denmark its £4.70 for 5GB [1]. Thats probably cheaper than buying a local sim and worth it for the convenience especially as I tend to use far less than that and only need 1GB as I'll just go for a few days. Then I may as well pay for the £1.10, 1GB option. 1. https://esimdb.com/denmark/bnesim reply gorbypark 18 hours agorootparentprevThere are some exceptions to the rule. I always go the local SIM route, and after burning through all my data from Andorra Telecom I decided to look at Airalo (and about 20 other eSIM providers). Airalo was cheaper for more than twice the data as buying a local SIM from Andorra Telecom. I could only get about 18GB/mo from Andorra Telecom (without a long term contract) but was able to get 45GB from Airalo and for a couple euros less per month. Also, the eSIM vs physical SIM was much more convenient. reply madeofpalk 22 hours agorootparentprevIsn't that always inherently true? With travel SIMs, what you're buying is convenience. Not to mention, some countries have annoying KYC processes for getting SIM cards/service. Presumably this bypasses that. reply doix 22 hours agorootparentIf I'm buying a SIM, there's a physical cost to manufacture the thing. There's no such cost with eSIMs. Also, to sell me a physical SIM, the telecom has to employ somebody to stand there and sell me a SIM. With an eSIM there's a website and it doesn't matter if 1 or 1000 people are buying SIMs at the same time. I would think that eventually the ability to scale would push the costs of eSIM down to be cheaper/the same as regular SIMs, but we aren't there yet. > With travel SIMs, what you're buying is convenience. I guess I'm not the target market here. Spending 5 minutes to get a cheaper + better deal is worth it to me then overpaying for limited data to avoid having to talk to somebody. reply codetrotter 21 hours agorootparent> to sell me a physical SIM, the telecom has to employ somebody to stand there and sell me a SIM In France there is a telco called Free, that has vending machines for SIM cards all across the country inside of various kiosks. It’s pretty great. I was there recently for a couple of months, and I went to one of these vending machines. Filled out some basic info about myself and paid with my debit card. The machine gave me a SIM card that I then put in my phone and have been using since. The amount of gigabytes was decent too. I am in a different country now, but still in the EU. Here I can still use the same SIM, but the amount of traffic that that plan gives me outside is pretty low compared to what it gave me in France. For now it’s been ok though, because here I have fiber at home. When I was in France the AirBnB we stayed at didn’t have any internet so that’s why I bought the French SIM with sufficient amount of gigas to get my work done. Anyway, this vending machine in kiosks system is awesome. More telcos should do that in other countries too. reply londons_explore 22 hours agorootparentprevThe local provider is, locally, usually a monopoly or near monopoly. They want to own the whole customer journey, be able to market/upsell other products, etc. That's why they directly sell service at rates far cheaper than they will let roaming providers access. reply etrautmann 22 hours agorootparentprevBut when you need more data and you’re in the middle of nowhere, you can just pay to add a bit more. reply londons_explore 22 hours agorootparentExcept with most of these esim apps, you can't.

Why would they let a third company undercut their prices... reply smileybarry 19 hours agoparentprevI have friends who happily use Airalo but I can't bear the latency & slowness that their routing adds. You're basically \"roaming\" on the local carrier, and your APN route you through an Airalo server. Which seems reasonable, except the server is some random OVH VPS with all the downsides of a noisy-neighbor cloud environment, and it's sometimes even all the way in the US. (Not to mention your geo IP is wrong and region-locked websites fail to load unless you find some local free WiFi. Netflix is also wonky thanks to that.) That's fine for some countries, but in my experience, roaming with my home carrier was somehow faster & more responsive (despite the APN being all the way in Israel). reply teekert 20 hours agoparentprevI also liked Airalo, worked very well. It was nice to use when visiting Montenegro. I paid 15 eur for 5 GB or so (valid 30 days)? But at the airport I immediately saw 100 GB for 5 eur or something like that :) (100 GB is practically unlimited, you can stream for a month and not hit it.) Still, it's nice to arrange everything from home before you leave. I think many places allow you to get a very good esim deal locally nowadays. That Firsty ad stuff actually sounds horrible. You're in a beautiful country, now watch this ad every hour or go offline. No thanks, I'd prefer to go wifi to wifi then. reply Addono 22 hours agoparentprevAiralo made getting a SIM in India so much easier. The KYC checks they introduced are poorly understood by local vendors making it really painful to get a local SIM. Also, being able to pre-purchase the SIM card means you can immediately browse when arriving. When we arrived, the WiFi in Chennai airport couldn't deliver the OTP to our foreign phone numbers, so without the pre-purchased eSIMs we wouldn't have been able to get internet. I don't like it that they charge such a premium, it makes having data as a tourist somewhat of a privilege.

I obviously don't like that the premium for an eSIM in a place like India is so high, but I think (having a brief look at esimdb.com) $20-30 USD for 10-15 GB is not unreasonable for the substantial portion of tourists to India who are already traveling from another continent [1], and considering it's in the range (±50% perhaps) of mobile data prices for a comparable plan in the UK or the US, I'm not sure it's that much of a privilege for tourists. To be clear, I don't mean that the premium is warranted, but just that it may not be much of a privilege for many tourists.

Then we agree on that :) For sure, it's not a big dent in ones budget for most travelers coming from other continents. The eSIM rates are indeed not that different from local rates. Looking at it transactionally, the premium is easily worth the convenience it yields. Most of what I dislike about it is that being nearly forced to take the eSIM makes me feel more like an outsider. Previous time I visited I did manage to get my local SIM, even though it took a couple of hours to find a store which was capable - and willingness - to issue one. This time, the regulation change caused my SIM card to get stuck in bureaucratic limbo because of new and poorly implemented additional KYC checks. I appreciated the chore of getting a local SIM card, because it exposes you to integrate somewhat. It leads to interesting encounters outside of the normal tourist bubble, not just the people but also a bit in how their day-to-day business works. As such, I would like to be able to recommend others to try to get the SIM for themselves too. Besides this 'stay in your privileged tourist bubble'-feeling, it also feels wrong that the premium between local data rates and the eSIM rates are that high. Even though the value-add seems minimal for anything other than skipping KYC completely and being able to pay with international credit card. That difference goes somewhere and - I worry - that by fuelling that niche it only incentivizes the eSIM providers to lobby for borderline impossible KYC checks on local SIMs, which they can bypass for anyone able to afford that premium. reply monksy 21 hours agorootparentprevHoly crap \"20$ not unreasonable for data in India\" That's a hard no.

The chip has software + data that allows this. eSIM: same (or similar) chip is soldered into your phone. Software is different, and allows storing the data part from multiple operators at the same time. You use your phone to switch between operators and add/remove potential operators (add part is over the internet via your phone, either via wifi or current active operator). By way of analogy you can download new \"SIM cards\" to your esIM, switch between them, delete them etc. It's a feature of your phone, either it supports eSIM (has such a chip and supporting software on the phone) or it doesn't.

The operator ended up being Drei Austria and all the traffic passed through Austria which meant that: - In Singapore the latency was high but essentially usable. - In NZ, especially in the more remote areas it was often completely unusable even when there was cell coverage as the latency and packet loss killed all the fun. - In NYC it was quite alright, nothing to cheer about but decent.

I just signed up for the Firsty app from the UK, and the eSIM it gave me appeared to be issued by Play Poland (https://www.play.pl). This then roamed on the EE network in the UK (https://ee.co.uk). As the SIM is roaming, there's no practical way for any KYC requirement to be enforced. This is the same as if an AT&T customer in the USA visited India (for example) and roamed onto an Indian network. Some of the eSIM providers like Airalo do offer certain plans with KYC requirements, but that's only for a minority of countries. reply dzhiurgis 23 hours agoprevSounds like same trap as free VPN reply dewey 23 hours agoparentNot really a trap if that's what everyone agrees on.

(techdirt.com)234 points by rntn 14 hours agohidepastfavorite38 comments yellowbkpk 6 hours agoIt boils down to the fact that the United States does not have (public domain) knowledge of every address in the country. The USPS knows about deliverable addresses but won't give that information to the federal government because then it'd be public domain and they would lose several of their primary data moats (Zipcodes, addresses, delivery routes, for example). The Census has very complete knowledge of every address, but won't give it up because it's illegal (see Title 13 of the US Code). There is an ongoing attempt by the DOT to collect a National Address Database (https://www.transportation.gov/gis/national-address-database) by collecting information from the address assigning authorities (usually county governments), but it's incomplete and unlikely to ever be complete because of holdout/underfunded local governments. There are several address datasets that are private (Google has a fairly complete one, FedEx/UPS probably have the most complete, TomTom, CostQuest, etc.). I started https://openaddresses.io/ to try and collect them (NAD is based off this idea) into an open-licensed dataset. The broadband companies have records that say \"this address is connected to this network, which could theoretically have this service level\", but (a) they won't/can't tell you where they think the address is and (b) won't spend the time to match their address string format with the government's address because both are private data. Finally, without the address -> location data, even if we could get broadband providers to tell us what service is available at each address, we couldn't put that service level on a map because we don't know where the address is. ---- The Markup published some work in 2022 where they used OpenAddresses to use ISP's own tools to gather per-address service offerings and put them on a map.

I would assume that both municipal and state governments would know exactly who owns what piece of property/natural resource rights/air rights/other property-related right at the click of a button. They only need to know well enough to send a tax bill. If someone is paying property taxes, that's good enough for the municipality. It's not good enough when people start suing each other, at which point the municipality very much does not want to own the liability for any mistakes. Consider the simple situation in which Alice sells property to Bob, without revealing (intentionally or mistakenly) that Carol has a lien against the property. If Carol comes to collect and Alice cannot pay, then Carol now also has a claim to the property. Things get even more complicated with fraud. Lets say that Eve manages to fraudulently record a transfer from Alice to Eve, and then sells the property to Bob. Bob has not committed fraud, but Alice also should own it. In systems in which the government registry is indefeasible, then Bob owns it; Alice may recover money (see above why municipalities don't want to be liable), but not the property (had Eve been caught before selling the property then the fraud would have invalidated her claim, but Bob hasn't committed any fraud). reply Solvency 4 hours agoparentprevI like the part where we're expected to just believe these agencies/departments aren't sharing and circulating address data internally, simply because they say they aren't.

Based on my previous experience in GovTech, I think this is what happened: The project team specs out a procurement. The procurement team gets bids and handles the bureaucracy of awarding the contract. After reviewing bids, the project team selects or shortlists finalists. A special part of the procurement team then handles negotiations. The negotiators usually know little to nothing about the project other than costs. In order to get a lower price, they will negotiate away things that the project team considers important but aren't spelled out in the requirements. Some of those things that gets easily negotiated away are rights for designs and data, even when gov't pays for their development. Negotiators are just looking for the lowest price for this particular project at this time. After all, there may or may not be extra costs in the future; they can claim wins on lower definite costs right now. Bidders know this game, and are ready and waiting to charge extra bucks for change orders down the line. I was a lead on a multi-million dollar open-first project for gov't.

    "originLink": "https://www.dmagazine.com/food-drink/2023/05/why-jalapeno-peppers-less-spicy-blame-aggies/",
    "originBody": "Advertisement It’s not just you: jalapeño peppers are less spicy and less predictable than ever before. As heat-seekers chase ever-fiercer varieties of pepper—Carolina reapers, scorpions, ghosts—the classic jalapeño is going in the opposite direction. And the long-term “de-spicification” of the jalapeño is a deliberate choice, not the product of a bad season of weather. This investigation began in my own kitchen. After months of buying heat-free jalapeños, I started texting chefs around Dallas to see if they were having the same experience. Many agreed. One prominent chef favors serranos instead. Regino Rojas of Revolver Taco Lounge suggested jalapeños are now “more veggie-like than chile.” Luis Olvera, owner of Trompo, said that jalapeños now have so much less heat that “I tell my staff, ‘I think my hands are just too damn sweet,’ because I can’t make salsa spicy enough anymore.” To be fair, not everyone agreed with these views. One restaurateur wondered if jalapeños seem less hot because diners have become infatuated with habaneros and serranos. Wayne White, general manager at Hutchins BBQ, offered a middle ground. “I noticed during covid, the quality got really bad, but now to me they’re beautiful,” he said. “We did have a season during covid, you could tell they were pulling them too soon, they weren’t that ripe. But I ate a whole jalapeño the other day, just to eat one, and it lit me up.” I searched the internet to see whether jalapeños are really getting milder, but only found shopping tips. Gardening websites offered savvier advice: that peppers grow hotter under stress. If they’re well-watered, they won’t produce as much capsaicin, the chemical that generates the sensation we know as spiciness. But even this explanation leaves unanswered questions. My sunny backyard, which produces ferocious peppers, is one thing. What about all the peppers in the grocery store? Clearly, a real investigation was required. So I called Stephanie Walker, extension vegetable specialist at New Mexico State University, advisory board member of that university’s Chile Pepper Institute, and chair of the 2023 New Mexico Chile Conference. “Other complaints have come my way,” Walker said at the start of our phone call. This turned out to be a comedic understatement: she has a massive, existential complaint about the state of the chile pepper industry. I got on the phone expecting to hear a prosaic story of weather patterns shifting, unusual rains in pepper-growing regions, or the spread of greenhouses. I would not have been surprised if she validated Rojas’ theory: that jalapeños are now grown to look pretty, shiny, and big, regardless of flavor. “Pesticides and other enhancing farming elements make them look beautiful but not really spicy,” Rojas suggested to me. People lost a lot of interest in tomatoes for a long time until heirlooms came back. Now we have the same thing with peppers. Stephanie Walker, New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute There’s truth to all these theories, but Walker says they are only secondary factors. “As more growers have adopted drip irrigation, more high-tech farming tools to grow the peppers, they’ll tend to be milder,” Walker told me first, as a sort of throat-clearing exercise before the real explanation. “But there’s more to it than that.” The truth is more like a vast industrial scheme to make the jalapeño more predictable—and less hot. The Vast Jalapeño Conspiracy Most jalapeños go straight to factories, for canned peppers, pickled pepper rings, salsas, cream sauces, dressings, flavored chips and crackers, dips, sausages, and other prepared foods. For all those companies, consistency is key. Think about the salsa world’s “mild,” “medium,” and “hot” labels. According to The Mexican Chile Pepper Cookbook by Dave DeWitt and José Marmolejo, 60 percent of jalapeños are sent to processing plants, 20 percent are smoke-dried into chipotles, and just 20 percent are sold fresh. Since big processors are the peppers’ main consumers, big processors get more sway over what the peppers taste like. Advertisement “It was a really big deal when breeders [told the industry], ‘hey, look, I have a low-heat jalapeño,’ and then a low-heat but high-flavor jalapeño,” Walker explained. “That kind of became the big demand for jalapeños—low heat jalapeños—because most of them are used for processing and cooking. [Producers] want to start with jalapeños and add oleoresin capsicum.” Would this jalapeño fritter from the 2015 State Fair of Texas taste less spicy if it was made today? Oleoresin capsicum is an extract from peppers, containing pure heat. It’s the active ingredient in pepper spray. It’s also the active ingredient, in a manner of speaking, for processed jalapeños. The salsa industry, Walker said, starts with a mild crop of peppers, then simply adds the heat extract necessary to reach medium and hot levels. She would know; she started her career working for a processed-food conglomerate. “I’ve worked in peppers in my entire life,” she told me. “Jalapeños were originally prized as being a hot pepper grown in the field. When we were making hot sauce in my previous job, we had the same problem, that you couldn’t predict the heat. When you’re doing a huge run of salsa for shipment, and you want a hot label, medium label, mild label, it’s really important to predict what kind of heat you’ll get. We tried a statistical design from the fields, and it just didn’t work, because mother nature throws stressful events at you or, sometimes, does not bring stress.” The standardization of the jalapeño was rapidly accelerated by the debut, about 20 years ago, of the TAM II jalapeño line, a reliably big, shiny, fleshy pepper that can grow up to six inches long—with little to no heat. TAM II peppers have become some of the most popular in the processing business. The 2002 paper in HortScience trumpeted TAM II’s benefits: virus resistance, absence of dark spots, longer fruit with thicker flesh, earlier maturation, and, compared to a variety of jalapeño called Grande, less than 10 percent of the spiciness. TAMs grown in one location measured in at 1620 Scoville units, while those at another came in at just 1080, which is milder than a poblano. In conclusion, the paper’s authors wrote, “The large, low-pungency fruit of ‘TMJ II’ will make it equally suited for fresh-market and processing uses.” DeWitt, writing in his solo book Chile Peppers: A Global History, says TAM became widespread in Texas after its introduction. “It was much milder and larger than the traditional jalapeños, and genes of this mild pepper entered the general jalapeño pool. Cross-breeding caused the gene pool to become overall larger and milder.” Since I know you’re wondering who the inventors are: the clue is in the name TAM II. The hot (but also not hot) new jalapeño is an invention of Texas A&M University. Yes, Aggies took the spice out of life. A tray from Hutchins BBQ, including a Texas Twinkie. Bret Redman And yes, “II” means it’s a sequel. The original TAM came out much earlier and was profiled in a 1983 article in the Christian Science Monitor. At the time, the A&M scientists estimated 800 acres were being grown nationally, and they told reporter Daniel Benedict that there was plenty of room left on the market for spicier stuff. (“For the hot-pepper lover, there’s something for him already.”) After 40 years of the milder pepper enjoying increased popularity, virus resistance, higher yields, and a shiny new sequel, hotter pre-TAM jalapeños appear to have lost substantial ground. Exact statistics on planting demand are hard to obtain because growers do not want to tip off seed suppliers on how to price their products. As the invention of TAM I and II suggests, “jalapeño” as a name does not connote a single breed or genetic line. There are varieties of jalapeño as there are of tomatoes. Mitla peppers are at the opposite end of the scale from TAMs, sometimes reaching 8000 Scoville units. (The A&M paper derides Mitlas since they are often wonkily curved, and need more culling.) Advertisement In my interviews around Dallas, I learned many restaurateurs don’t know what breed their supplier is offering, or even that various breeds exist. At Hutchins BBQ, which employs four people full-time preparing around 7,000 jalapeños a week for its iconic brisket-stuffed Texas Twinkies, suppliers drop off peppers and the barbecue joint sorts through, picking the specimens they want and returning the rest. Hutchins deseeds the peppers to reduce any remaining heat. For heat seekers, Walker recommends Mitla and Early jalapeños; they’re called “Early” not because they were picked early but because, as a breed, they grow quickly and are well-adapted to cooler environments. First heirloom tomatoes, next heirloom peppers? Walker compares the current state of the pepper industry with the world of American tomatoes, which were bred for hardiness in shipping, firmness, and canning. Only recently has an heirloom tomato revolution tried to cater directly to home cooks and chefs with tomato breeds that emphasize flavor and juiciness first. “People lost a lot of interest in tomatoes for a long time until heirlooms came back,” Walker said. “Now we have the same thing with peppers. There’s a place for people to embrace heirloom peppers, the way that we have with tomatoes.” For gardeners and small growers, the Chile Pepper Institute sells seeds but results will always be complicated, since a hot, dry summer can turn even TAM jalapeños into weapons, and a cool, wet season will result in pampered plants. But how can you find hotter peppers if you are shopping, or looking to supply your restaurant? Walker’s best advice is to lobby suppliers and grocers for specific pepper breeds. Ask a produce manager or a supplier if you can get Early or Mitla peppers, or if the store can label its pepper breeds. And ignore the bogus factoids spread by many online shopping guides. I found a Rachael Ray Show article claiming that bigger peppers are always spicier than smaller ones—which contradicts everything I had just learned about TAMs being deliberately engineered for size. Walker called that tip “misinformation.” If lobbying your grocery managers sounds like a futile effort, look at the changes that have rippled through the tomato industry as breeders re-embrace heirlooms. Or look at the widespread adoption of a less stinky breed of Brussels sprouts, scientifically developed through a similar selective breeding process, which turned that vegetable from a punchline into a favorite. “I think it’s a great opportunity for growers who really want to get into specializing in some of these heirloom varieties,” Walker said. Let’s hope some farmers are reading this and yearning for the days when a jalapeño was a reliable source of spice. Those days can return.

    "commentBody": "Why jalapeño peppers are less spicy (2023) (dmagazine.com)228 points by thefilmore 12 hours agohidepastfavorite262 comments tptacek 11 hours agoThe reason I took away from this: large agricultural producers of peppers bred towards a \"low heat, low variance\" standard, away from a \"high variance\" standard that produced frequent hot jalapenos. Low-heat-low-variance is better for mass food production, because producers can just dose the capsaicin directly, which is something they can't do easily when every pepper is a wildcard. There are second-order effects, like drip irrigation and cultivation techniques that optimize for shape, size, and color over heat --- but those are enabled by the industrial jalapeno's new position in the production chain. The peppers just aren't the point where the heat is introduced anymore; that happens later. Might as well optimize for good looking peppers. This seems fine? Peppers are one of the easier and more forgiving things to grow yourself. Just grow your own or buy from a farmer's market. Moments later, after reading the thread This kind of stuff really seems to piss people off, but when you think about the disempowerment of the jalapeno, try to keep in mind that the same industrial processes have performed unalloyed positive things. Have you noticed that you're way more into brussels sprouts now than you were when you were a kid? If you're a GenX-er or a Millenial, that's because today's (delicious) sprouts aren't the same plant as the (gross) sprouts of yore. Same deal with broccolini, which hadn't even been invented until after your birthday (for most of you). reply yashap 10 hours agoparent> Have you noticed that you're way more into brussels sprouts now than you were when you were a kid? If you're a GenX-er or a Millenial, that's because today's (delicious) sprouts aren't the same plant as the (gross) sprouts of yore. This is an oft-quoted fact, and it’s true that modern brussels sprouts are less bitter, but that’s far from the whole story. The popular preparation used to be boiling or steaming, and many people still find that gross with modern varieties. But over the past 15-20 years, frying or roasting them, and topping it off with things like bacon, parm, balsamic reduction, etc. became the standard preparation, and this is just a way more delicious way to cook them (for most ppl). I’d assume this makes a massively bigger difference than a reduction in bitterness. reply nightshift1 8 hours agorootparentNot everyone tastes them the same. There is a gene that makes you taste more or less the bitterness of PTC (phenylthiocarbamide) https://www.centreofthecell.org/blog/science-questions/why-d... reply SamBam 7 hours agorootparentSure, but the percentage of people with that gene hasn't changed, yet it is an oft-cited anecdote (I don't know if there's data) that more people like them now than they did forty years ago.

I have a couple of theories: I think consumer preferences have pushed in that direction (e.g. I remember McDonalds chicken nuggets used to have chewy gristle in them), and JIT inventories mean that ingredients can be fresher, and food science (e.g. additives and preservatives) has improved, and improved flavor along with it, and there are also new preparation methods which improve quality of the final product. reply coryrc 6 hours agorootparent> used to have chewy gristle in them Chickens have gained significant breast mass in the last few decades (so much so it causes \"woody breast\") and, with increased supply, the price of breast meat (less gristle) has come down proportionally.

Which meant that if you lived in a city, you bought bread because you were very unlikely to have a place to bake it.

Mark Miller's conversation with Tyler Cowen is good on this subject: https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/mark-miller/. Chiles are actually fruits and, combined judiciously, create a lot of complex flavors. Excess spiciness overwhelms the flavor. And people who want absurdly spicy peppers, can get them: ghost chiles, carolina reapers, and so on. \"Flavor > heat\" in other words. reply PheonixPharts 11 hours agorootparent> I prefer more flavorful chiles, with less spice. As someone with a fairly high spice tolerance, I've found a strong correlation between heat and flavor. I think anyone coming from a culture that eats spicy food will agree. I had a batch of habaneros I grew last summer that were both the most spicy habaneros I've had, and by far the most flavorful. I've also had some very tasty ghost peppers (when used in moderation). Outside of peppers that are inherently not spicy, such as pablanos, heat and flavor seem to coincide. All of the most flavorful chili dishes I've had in my life have all been quite spicy, and I can't recall any mild chili dishes I've had with nearly the same punch. The only time I've seen heat and flavor not connected is in terrible hot sauces which aim to be shockingly spices that make use of capsaicin extract. reply mathgeek 10 hours agorootparentAs someone who also prefers the taste that comes along with spice, best reasoning I have heard is folks who don’t like spice cannot even taste the flavor that comes with it, so they associate milder peppers as tasting better. I.e. when you are screaming for water you don’t stop to consider the flavor (or you may not even taste it at all as your brain tells you to go into flight mode). reply trealira 7 hours agorootparentYes, I think you're right. When I eat something that's too spicy for me, I can't taste anything. My tongue is numb and feels like it's burning.

I think anyone coming from a culture that eats spicy food will agree. I couldn't agree more. I grow a variety of chili plants on my balcony each year, from the Jalapeno (red and green) all the way to the Morugas and the Bhut Jolokias, with some varieties in between such as Chiltepins and Scotch Bonnet peppers. I think the Habanero is my go-to for most dishes - they're hot enough without being as insanely hot as the ones at the upper end of the scoville scale. That being said, I've enough experience now to know how much of which to put in each dish, and my freezer is full off pods from previous harvests. I can't cook without chilis, garlic and onions.

Scotch Bonnets are probably among the most flavorful, while I find the much hotter Ghost pepper not to taste like much. reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan 7 hours agorootparentYeah I think this logic only holds true for individual peppers within one species (or batches of peppers, or even regional variants of peppers). The hotter ones also have more flavor. If you're comparing two different species of plant though I think all bets are off.

Consider many of the smaller, more ornamental, chile varieties: they're often quite spicy, but lack good flavor because they have an almost grassy solvent note in the background of their flavor profile. That said, I get the hiccups (involuntary) when spice level exceeds a certain threshold, so I'd love if the flavor could be improved while keeping the spice level below my hiccup threshold. reply SantalBlush 8 hours agorootparentprevIn my opinion, habaneros have the best flavor out of any chili.

I could, I just didn't want any more of it. reply dunham 9 hours agorootparentIt could be quite possible that for a given pepper, the variables that increase the capsaicin also increase the flavor compounds. It is possible to separate out the flavor, I remember reading about Grant Achatz experimenting with it, but you need a rotary evaporator to pull it off. reply theultdev 10 hours agorootparentprevI don't think so, ghost peppers have a very rich flavor to me. Habaneros have a sweet flavor that accompany their spice. Serranos have a very distinct flavor as well. Each pepper has a flavor that comes with the spice, and yeah the more spicy the pepper they more rich the flavor generally. reply marklubi 10 hours agorootparentprevCapsaicin itself is boring. Frankly, I think it tastes rather metallic. Hot sauces that add it to boost their \"spiciness\" ratings taste awful as a result.

Being desensitized to heat does not desensitize you to flavor. Because of a correlation between heat and flavor diversity in peppers, people desensitized to the heat can taste the more complex range of flavors available in peppers. reply demondemidi 8 hours agorootparentThere it is!

What I did state is not controversial. Self-selecting expertise in the qualities of food applies to a great many things we eat. It doesn't have anything to do with \"superior taste\".

There's a throwaway sentence in the book that refers to chiles, and the sauces made with them (\"salsa\" means sauce) not being fully appreciated. This led me down the path of \"fruit purees as salsa\" and I spent a fair amount of time working with chiles and regular peppers. I definitely agree, I find that once the spiciness exceeds some level I simply don't enjoy the flavor the food. But when the spiciness is below that threshold, I absolutely love the flavor of pureed peppers. You can definitely tell all the different chiles apart, some are quite earthy, others are sweet fruits (habanero), other taste like raisins to me (pasilla). reply ortusdux 10 hours agorootparentprevOne of the best unique beers I've ever had was a Jalapeno ale. The yeast had metabolized all the capsaicin, so there was zero spice. The Jalapeno flavor was crisp and clean, and you could taste a depth of flavor that was normally overshadowed by the heat. It made me appreciate peppers more now that I knew what to taste for. I've been meaning to try and recreate it and then work my way through various peppers/chilies. reply huytersd 8 hours agorootparentWait, does yeast break down capsaicin? That doesn’t make sense to me since I make a lot of extremely spicy fermented, hot sauces, and they don’t lose their heat. reply ska 9 hours agorootparentprev> Less spicy is actually good. I prefer more flavorful chiles, with less spice. Two problems with this idea as applies to the article. First, it's hard to separate the two in breeding (many of the most flavorful chiles, far more so than jalepenos, are pretty hot). Second, industrial production optimizing for a lot of things: shipability, stability, shelf life, consistent size/appearance, in this case consistent capsicum ... most of these are considered more important than flavor according to revealed preference. Consider the current \"standard tomato”. Round, dense, deep red, mostly flavorless.

I LOVE the flavor of habaneros but their spiciness prevents me from putting too much. That said on the flavor/spiciness scale a lot of the Chinese varieties are excellent. The chili peppers used in Sichuanese cuisine are actually not that spicy compared to habaneros or Thai chilis, which allows it to be possible to dump a bag full into a dish and it gives it a LOT of rich flavor. reply code_duck 20 minutes agorootparentThere is a variety of habanero developed in Oregon that look just like a regular one but have almost no heat. Unfortunately they don’t have the same fruity flavor or tartness as typical habaneros, or really much flavor at all. reply anthomtb 10 hours agorootparentprevWhen using hot peppers I remove some of, or all, of the seeds and pith. You can greatly control the amount of heat this way since the seeds and pith have the most concentrated capsaicin. Maybe habanero is too potent for that strategy but it works well on jalapeno, serrano, and whatever they grow in Hatch, NM.

Oxtails got popularized by celebrity chefs so theres a lot more demand than the supply can handle now.

There are two distinct cuts of pork used for bacon: belly and loin. In the US, belly is the default ‘bacon’, and to get bacon made from pork loin you need to look for ‘Canadian bacon’ (but that will have the fat all trimmed off) or ‘Irish bacon’, or you might find ‘back bacon’ in a butcher or deli counter. In the UK the default ‘bacon’ is back bacon, made from the loin. If you want belly meat you need to look for ‘streaky bacon’. Weirdly I think this is a case where US FDA regulations are oddly strict about what can be sold as ‘bacon’ and how it has to be packaged (those weird little fat windows in the cardboard) which prevents back bacon being offered as a normal product. reply dgfitz 10 hours agorootparentprevThey’re not completely different things.

Serranos are more vegetal, I guess? But jalapenos are pretty variable, especially depending on ripeness, and I would claim right now (without being able to back it up) that serranos fit into the spectrum of possible jalapenos (like: there is a jalapeno somewhere that tastes just like the median serrano), minus the capsaicin.

Just grow your own or buy from a farmer's market. There's only 5 species that make up the domesticated peppers. Most come from just 2: capsicum annuum (bell peppers, jalapenos, anaheims, and the vast majority of the rest) and capsicum chinense (scotch bonnet, habenero, ghost peppers, etc). [1] Those 2 species will also cross-breed pretty well, and within a species there is of course no barrier for crossing. The best part of having a garden with a lot of pepper varieties is that next year's volunteers are going to be some fun mystery-cross, like cayanne looking pepper with no heat, or a super hot (but slightly mangled looking) hatch. Sometimes different seeds from a single pod may produce wildly different crosses - pollen from multiple plants may be on that bee! So while you're absolutely correct that peppers are very forgiving[2] to grow yourself, amusingly that makes breeding your own jalapenos for next year a lot of extra effort. If you don't net them off from pollinators and hand pollinate, you will likely get unexpected results. [1] https://peppergeek.com/capsicum-pepper-species/ has a nice overview for the curious.

You only hear hushed whispers of him at the other markets, but through a various sequence of flatteries and bribes you will be lead to him at the Clement Street farmer’s market on Sundays. (as of 2024) Jamil at Raised Roots makes some of the most delicious fermented hot sauces made with only the showcase pepper, salt, water and garlic. I wish I could give him some traffic but it seems his web presence is a bit outdated, so if you’re in the area check out the scorpion and fatalii. They are absolutely delicious. As I understand it it’s an “urban farm” so it has multiple plots around the city of Oakland. Meaning the peppers are grown outside, meaning they are seasonal. So raised roots only sells peppers at harvest in November, but you can get the sauce all year round. That’s the state of wanting hot peppers living in San Francisco. reply simonsarris 11 hours agoprevIt's interesting how bad incentives are when something with qualitative differences (flavor, heat) is sold by the pound. Making it more palatable expands the market up to a point, but so does requiring more peppers generally. The most durable countermeasure seems to be totally outside of the purview of economics: building up a culture of caring about the product. Like tomatoes in Italy, or coffee beans among coffee lovers. For heat we've mostly had to rely on serrano or (when in season here) the Hungarian wax pepper (varies wildly between 1k and 15k scoville) reply NoboruWataya 11 hours agoparentAre the incentives \"bad\", really? It seems like they are getting less spicy because that is what most people want. There seems to be an assumption that because Big Jalapeño are changing the flavour it must be for the worse. Personally I prefer spicier peppers but I am definitely an outlier amongst my friends at least. I don't know that we need countermeasures, as such. I think it's fine to have a very common, affordable product that is predictable and palatable to the masses alongside other more niche variants which are popular with \"enthusiasts\" (and therefore might be less widely available and more expensive). That's kind of how it is with coffee. Most people get theirs from Starbucks or some other big chain. I hate that stuff but they clearly like it, and I don't begrudge them it. As long as I am able to get my fruity single-origin light roasts.

I'd imagine the same applies to any commercially grown crops (another comment mentioned that there is basically only one commercial variety of bananas), which would explain why jalapenos are less spicy than they used to be. https://youtu.be/ngjAqzam0fU TL;DW; - Almost all commercially grown crops are from hybrids, which means two varieties bred to produce a new variety with the selected characteristics of both. - The characteristics that are chosen are those which are most commercially viable: long shelf life, visually appealing, size uniformity - these are often at the detrement of other characteristics such as flavor, nutrients or in this case heat - Hybrid plants usually do not 'remain true', meaning their offspring will not have the same characteristics. This means farmers need to buy new seed each year to maintain the same characteristics. This results in hybrid seeds being very valuable - some are worth 10x more per kg than gold. - Hybrids seeds are produced by pollinating plants by hand.

In the Solanaceae family, in the Capsicum genus, in the annuum sub-genus, there are dozens of hybrid and cultivar fruiting plants, which are all referred to as \"Jalapeño\". They all have different properties in how they grow and what they turn into. This includes taste, size, color, shape, and spiciness. (https://www.thechileman.org/results.php?chile=1&find=Jalapen...) If you want to buy \"a Jalapeño\", or any kind of produce, and have a reliable experience, you can't just wander into a random store and pick up a generic name for 40 different cultivars, made god knows where and how, shipped to your neighborhood god knows how, and expect that the thing you selected is exactly what you wanted. Imagine you want a burger. You go to the Big Burger Mart. From a giant bin labeled \"Burger\", you pick one Burger. You take it home and eat it. Will it be the burger you expected, from the place you expected, tasting the way you expected? Maybe not! But it's An Burger! You didn't seem to care what kind of burger it was when you picked it out of a big bin called \"Burger\". You didn't ask where it came from, how it was prepared, how long it's been sitting there, etc. So you can't really expect anything but \"Generic Burger\", which personally doesn't sound very tasty. To get the produce you expect, you should buy a specific cultivar of produce from a reliable producer. And you're probably gonna need to buy it locally, because the food logistics chain delivering a pepper from Chile all the way to Nebraska is not going to result in an ideal pepper. Another way to get what you expect is to grow it yourself. Many jalapeño cultivars (and other peppers!) grow well in containers. If you want to skip the whole gardening thing, you can buy a pre-grown bush of jalapeño online from a nursery like Bonnie, and just keep it alive and enjoy fresh peppers indefinitely. I actually feel bad for the supermarkets. They have to read the minds of customers that demand so much, feed back that information to growers about what to grow, and then get it into the stores, with 365-days-a-year perfect consistency, unblemished, \"ripe\", and tasty.

I say that because if one goes to their local garden center right now and buys a jalapeño seedling, puts it in a fairly large pot and gives it a regular dose of N and a daily dose of water and puts outside in the 65-80F weather for the next few months it will produce peppers that are very large and taste pretty similar to the ones in the grocery store. Pick, them just as they reach an couple inches in length before they start to ripen and taste them. Then if one lives in the south, brings it inside next year over the winter, and stop fertilizing it, and reduces watering it to once a week or so, it will again produce peppers next year that will be a lot hotter, but during the summer if you live in somewhere its getting over 100F daily, stop watering it until it starts to drop its leaves and pull it back from the brink of death ever couple weeks over the summer. The last peppers to set in the late spring early summer will only grow to be an inch or so long and the plant will stubbornly refuse to drop them even when they start to shrivel a bit and its lost most of its full size leaves only sprouting 1/4\" long leaves during the short periods of recovery when the soil isn't bone dry. Then after a couple months when those peppers get really dark before they start to turn red, pick one and taste it. The second year that plan will produce peppers hotter than probably anything most people have ever tasted. But, the plant will get strong and gnarly, continue to mistreat it for another year or two and what you will have is a pepper that no one can actually eat. In my 20's I found pleasure in sampling top ten lists of hottest hot sauces and peppers, but nothing prepared me for the pepper I pulled off a ~5 year old jalapeño plant I had largely been ignoring all summer long and hadn't been fertilized since it was a seedling. A single bite, and about two chews, and I went into an upper body \"hickup\" that might be better described as a repeating upper body spasm, and a mouth burn unlike anything I've ever experience before or since. Those are peppers one should pick with gloves. Pepper genetics or even variety aren't the largest dictator of how hot a pepper is. A bigger factor is how they are grown. Give a young plant a 70-80F pleasant environment, plenty of water and nutrient rich soil and they produce lots and lots of peppers that vary only slightly in heat based on their variety. Exactly what a commercial grower will do to maximize yield. Keep a plant on life support for multiple years and it will be an ugly thing, producing only a few peppers that grow slowly and ripen slowly over months, stress it to the point where its largely dropped all its leaves and only has a few small leaves baked daily in full 100F+ sun and it will produce peppers that are by themselves in-edible. reply giraffe_lady 11 hours agoprevThe article kind of mentions this but I think most professionals have shifted to serranos except when they want the big slices for a garnish or something.

I love serranos though, dice up a few and throw into a standard chicken and rice casserole recipe. that's really good stuff. reply thrwwycbr 11 hours agoprevThe article doesn't contain the actual reason. I'd argue that the real reason is that peppers are now mass produced in clean, bug-free, environments. Which means: No bug bites, no spice. If you grow peppers indoors where no bugs are, they tend to be a very mild produce. If you put them outside (and have enough insects around), they get much more spicy. Of course the usage of pesticides contributes to that effect, due to bugs not having a chance to bite the fruits anymore. reply episteme 11 hours agoparentWhy do bug bites increase spice? reply thrwwycbr 11 hours agorootparentThey release enzymes necessary for the spice/acid production. The acid counteracts those enzymes. If you cut open peppers, you can see the black veins which were bit by bugs, those are the ones containing the carbon acid. A better way to protect them against virusses but not against bugs that won't harm them is by combining the top of peppers with the root of potatoes, and by using moss to heal the cuts where you combined them (e.g. with a toothpick) Of course that won't work on an industrial scale, hence them favoring pesticides. reply progmetaldev 11 hours agorootparentI've read that slightly dehydrating your plants as they fruit is developing helps increase the capsaicin. You can also blend up the peppers and spray them down, which seems to agitate the peppers, and possibly send a chemical signal for the plant to start produce more capsaicin (although that's all been anecdotal evidence to my knowledge). reply akavi 11 hours agorootparentprev\"The acid\"? Capsaicin (the compound responsible for a pepper's \"heat\") is not an acid. Also, I've never noticed \"black veins\" in any peppers I've prepared, including very spicy ones. reply thrwwycbr 11 hours agorootparentWell, technically, capsaicin is the end of the reaction. Some might argue that all carbon acid amids are - as the name says - products of carbon acid reactions with ammonia. At least in a natural, non synthesized, environment. reply ricardobeat 10 hours agorootparentprevThe bites themselves don’t cause the plant to produce more capsaicin. It’s natural selection - plants in areas with lots of insects end up producing more capsaicin as a means of protecting themselves. They are hotter, and insects will not bite them as a result. Happy to be proven wrong if you have sources saying otherwise, but I’m quite certain this is the science behind it. reply thaumasiotes 8 hours agorootparentThis is basically the same as arguing that exposure to sunlight won't darken your skin, but it will mean that natural selection gives your descendants darker skin. There is every reason to expect that a plant's defenses against predation will be more active the more predation it experiences. reply quickslowdown 11 hours agorootparentprevThe spice is an evolved defense mechanism, so if it's not needed, the peppers eventually stop producing it.

I'm sure someone can give a better & more accurate answer! reply yellowapple 11 hours agorootparentIt's indeed a defense mechanism, but (from what I understand) it has less to do with bugs and more to do with mammals; pepper plants started surrounding the seeds with capsaicin to ward off mammals (which chew up and destroy the seeds) while still being palatable to birds (which ingest the seeds whole and \"drop them off\" elsewhere). Then a certain species of primate decided \"Grug inflict pain on self, makes Grug happy\" and the rest is history. reply temp0826 10 hours agorootparentNo problem for birds either who don't have the taste buds for capsaicin.

    "originBody": "Gemini and Google’s Culture Posted onMonday, February 26, 2024Monday, February 26, 2024 Author by Ben Thompson Last Wednesday, when the questions about Gemini’s political viewpoint were still limited to its image creation capabilities, I accused the company of being timid: Stepping back, I don’t, as a rule, want to wade into politics, and definitely not into culture war issues. At some point, though, you just have to state plainly that this is ridiculous. Google specifically, and tech companies broadly, have long been sensitive to accusations of bias; that has extended to image generation, and I can understand the sentiment in terms of depicting theoretical scenarios. At the same time, many of these images are about actual history; I’m reminded of George Orwell in 1984: Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don’t know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories. Even if you don’t want to go so far as to invoke the political implications of Orwell’s book, the most generous interpretation of Google’s over-aggressive RLHF of their models is that they are scared of being criticized. That, though, is just as bad: Google is blatantly sacrificing its mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” by creating entirely new realities because it’s scared of some bad press. Moreover, there are implications for business: Google has the models and the infrastructure, but winning in AI given their business model challenges will require boldness; this shameful willingness to change the world’s information in an attempt to avoid criticism reeks — in the best case scenario! — of abject timidity. If timidity were the motivation, then it’s safe to say that the company’s approach with Gemini has completely backfired; while Google turned off Gemini’s image generation capabilities, it’s text generation is just as absurd: I was able to replicate this! They need to shut Gemini down. It is several months away from being ready for prime time. It is astounding that Google released it in this state. https://t.co/wCqKE1eLbI pic.twitter.com/dxWavP3oei — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) February 25, 2024 That is just one examples of many: Gemini won’t help promote meat, write a brief about fossil fuels, or even help sell a goldfish. It says that effective accelerationism is a violent ideology, that libertarians are morally equivalent to Stalin, and insists that it’s hard to say what caused more harm: repealing net neutrality or Hitler. Some of these examples, particularly the Hitler comparisons (or Mao vs George Washington), are obviously absurd and downright offensive; others are merely controversial. They do, though, all seem to have a consistent viewpoint: Nate Silver, in another tweet, labeled it “the politics of the median member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.” Needless to say, overtly expressing those opinions is not timid, which raises another question from Silver: Gemini is behaving exactly as instructed. Asking it to draw different groups of people (e.g. \"Vikings\" or \"NHL players\") is the base case, not an edge case. The questions are all about how it got greenlit by a $1.8T market cap company despite this incredibly predictable behavior. — Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) February 23, 2024 In fact, I think there is a precedent for Gemini; like many comparison points for modern-day Google, it comes from Microsoft. Microsoft and The Curse of Culture From Neowin, in 2010: 1 Microsoft workers celebrated the release to manufacturing of Windows Phone 7 by parading through their Redmond campus on Friday with iPhone and BlackBerry hearses. Employees dressed up in fancy dress and also modified cars to include Windows Phone branding. Aside from the crazy outfits the workers made fake hearses for giant BlackBerry and iPhone devices. Employees cheekily claimed they had buried the competition with Windows Phone 7. This was, to be clear, insane. I wrote about the episode in 2013’s The Curse of Culture; it’s been eight years, so I hope you’ll allow me a particularly long excerpt: As with most such things, culture is one of a company’s most powerful assets right until it isn’t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction. More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need to do so. From Edgar Schein’s Organizational Culture and Leadership: Basic assumptions, like theories-in-use, tend to be nonconfrontable and nondebatable, and hence are extremely difficult to change. To learn something new in this realm requires us to resurrect, reexamine, and possibly change some of the more stable portions of our cognitive structure…Such learning is intrinsically difficult because the reexamination of basic assumptions temporarily destabilizes our cognitive and interpersonal world, releasing large quantities of basic anxiety. Rather than tolerating such anxiety levels, we tend to want to perceive the events around us as congruent with our assumptions, even if that means distorting, denying, projecting, or in other ways falsifying to ourselves what may be going on around us. It is in this psychological process that culture has its ultimate power. Probably the canonical example of this mindset was Microsoft after the launch of the iPhone. It’s hard to remember now, but no company today comes close to matching the stranglehold Microsoft had on the computing industry from 1985 to 2005 or so. The company had audacious goals — “A computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software” — which it accomplished and then surpassed: the company owned enterprise back offices as well. This unprecedented success changed that goal — originally an espoused belief — into an unquestioned assumption that of course all computers should be Microsoft-powered. Given this, the real shock would have been then-CEO Steve Ballmer not laughing at the iPhone. A year-and-a-half later, Microsoft realized that Windows Mobile, their current phone OS, was not competitive with the iPhone and work began on what became Windows Phone. Still, unacknowledged cultural assumptions remained: one, that Microsoft had the time to bring to bear its unmatched resources to make something that might be worse at the beginning but inevitably superior over time, and two, that the company could leverage Windows’ dominance and their Office business. Both assumptions had become cemented in Microsoft’s victory in the browser wars and their slow-motion takeover of corporate data centers; in truth, though, Microsofts’ mobile efforts were already doomed, and nearly everyone realized it before Windows Phone even launched with a funeral for the iPhone. Steve Ballmer never figured it out; his last acts were to reorganize the company around a “One Microsoft” strategy centered on Windows, and to buy Nokia to prop up Windows Phone. It fell to Satya Nadella, his successor, to change the culture, and it’s why the fact his first public event was to announce Office for iPad was so critical. I wrote at the time: This is the power CEOs have. They cannot do all the work, and they cannot impact industry trends beyond their control. But they can choose whether or not to accept reality, and in so doing, impact the worldview of all those they lead. Microsoft under Nadella’s leadership has, over the last three years, undergone a tremendous transformation, embracing its destiny as a device-agnostic service provider; still, it is fighting the headwinds of Amazon’s cloud, open source tooling, and the fact that mobile users had six years to get used to a world without Microsoft software. How much stronger might the company have been had it faced reality in 2007, but the culture made that impossible. Google is not in nearly as bad of shape as Microsoft was when it held that funeral. The company’s revenue and profits are as high as ever, and the release of Gemini 1.5 in particular demonstrated how well-placed the company is for the AI era: the company not only has leading research, it also has unmatched infrastructure that enables entirely new and valuable use cases. That, though, makes the Gemini fiasco all the more notable. Don’t Be Evil The questions around Google and AI have, to date, been mostly about business model. In last year’s AI and the Big Five I talked about how Kodak invented the digital camera, but didn’t pursue it because of business model reasons, and made the obvious analogy to Google’s seeming inability to ship: Google has long been a leader in using machine learning to make its search and other consumer-facing products better (and has offered that technology as a service through Google Cloud). Search, though, has always depended on humans as the ultimate arbiter: Google will provide links, but it is the user that decides which one is the correct one by clicking on it. This extended to ads: Google’s offering was revolutionary because instead of charging advertisers for impressions — the value of which was very difficult to ascertain, particularly 20 years ago — it charged for clicks; the very people the advertisers were trying to reach would decide whether their ads were good enough… That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory. Google has started shipping, and again, Gemini 1.5 is an incredible breakthrough; the controversy over Gemini, though, is a reminder that culture can restrict success as well. Google has its own unofficial motto — “Don’t Be Evil” — that founder Larry Page explained in the company’s S-1: Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served — as shareholders and in all other ways — by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company. Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see. Google has by-and-large held to that promise, at least as defined by Page: the company does not sell search result placement. Of course the company has made ads look more and more like organic results, and crammed ever more into the search results page, and squeezed more and more verticals, but while there are always whispers about what is or isn’t included in search, or the decisions made by the algorithm, most people still trust the product, and use it countless times every day. One does wonder, though, if the sanctity of search felt limiting to some inside of Google. In 2018 a video leaked of an all-hands meeting after the 2016 election where Google executives expressed dismay over the results; the footage was damaging enough that Google felt compelled to issue a statement: At a regularly scheduled all hands meeting, some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season. For over 20 years, everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings. Nothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without regard to political viewpoint. Perhaps this seemed to some employees to be an outdated view of the world; I’m reminded of that quote from Angela Y Davis: “In a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” In this view calls for color-blindness in terms of opportunity are insufficient; the only acceptable outcome is one in which outcomes are equal as well. The equivalent in the case of Google would be that it is not enough to not be evil; one must be “anti-evil” as well. The end result is that just as Microsoft could, shielded by years of a Windows monopoly, delude themselves into thinking they had an iPhone killer, Google could, shielded by years of a search monopoly, delude themselves into thinking they had not just the right but the obligation to tell users what they ought to believe. After Gemini As I noted in the excerpt, I very much try to avoid politics on Stratechery; I want to talk about business models and societal impact, and while that has political implications, it doesn’t need to be partisan (for example, I think this piece about the 2016 election holds up very well, and isn’t partisan in the slightest). AI, though, is increasingly giving all of us no choice in the matter. To that end, my Article last fall about the Biden executive order, Attenuating Innovation, was clearly incomplete: not only must we keep in mind the potential benefits of AI — which are massive — but it is clearly essential that we allow open source models to flourish as well. It is Google or OpenAI’s prerogative to train their models to have whatever viewpoint they want; any meaningful conception of freedom should make space for an open market of alternatives, and that means open source. Secondly, it behooves me, and everyone else in tech, to write Articles like the one you are reading; “the politics of the median member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors” has had by far the loudest voice in tech because most people just want to build cool new things, or write about them, without being fired or yelled at on social media. This does, though, give the perception that tech is out of touch, or actively authoritarian; I don’t think that’s true, but those of us who don’t want to tell everyone else what to think, do, paradoxically, need to say so. The biggest question of all, though, is Google. Again, this is a company that should dominate AI, thanks to their research and their infrastructure. The biggest obstacle, though, above and beyond business model, is clearly culture. To that end, the nicest thing you can say about Google’s management is to assume that they, like me and everyone else, just want to build products and not be yelled at; that, though, is not leadership. Schein writes: When we examine culture and leadership closely, we see that they are two sides of the same coin; neither can really be understood by itself. On the one hand, cultural norms define how a given nation or organizations will define leadership — who will get promoted, who will get the attention of followers. On the other hand, it can be argued that the only thing of real importance that leaders do is to create and manage culture; that the unique talent of leaders is their ability to understand and work with culture; and that it is an ultimate act of leadership to destroy culture when it is viewed as dysfunctional. That is exactly what Nadella did at Microsoft. I recounted in The End of Windows how Nadella changed the company’s relationship to Windows, unlocking the astronomical growth that has happened under his watch, including the company’s position in AI. Google, quite clearly, needs a similar transformation: the point of the company ought not be to tell users what to think, but to help them make important decisions, as Page once promised. That means, first and foremost, excising the company of employees attracted to Google’s power and its potential to help them execute their political program, and return decision-making to those who actually want to make a good product. That, by extension, must mean removing those who let the former run amok, up to and including CEO Sundar Pichai. The stakes, for Google specifically and society broadly, are too high to simply keep one’s head down and hope that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors magically comes to its senses.

It gets a passing grade on that Turing test. https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LogicBomb reply tppiotrowski 16 hours agoparentMaybe the way to explain an LLM to the general public is to think of it as a child. The words that child learns and uses come somewhat from their parents. If the parents are fighting and saying f** and b**, the kid will learn those words. If they hear a catchy phrase in a cartoon, they'll repeat it. If their parents discuss how much they hate a certain person or issue, the kid will probably adopt those beliefs. And if their parents have CNN or Fox News playing in the background will also have an effect on the thoughts that child produces. An LLM is just a product of its environment, mostly published books and the Internet. This content is skewed to being produced by the bourgeois. If we put a microphone on everyone from birth and feed it to an LLM, we'd get a more diverse output but we're not there yet. reply binary132 15 hours agorootparentPeople need to be willing to recognize and admit that this is not an “oopsie data bias” problem. It’s “feature working as intended”. reply appplication 5 hours agorootparentReading your comment “feature working as intended”, I can’t tell if that’s supposed to be conspiratorial or just blunt. I think the linked twitter images tell a pretty reasonable story. Sure, you could argue the model appears biased against some conservative media, but I think the reality is that it is a self-inflicted wound from conservative media’s general lack of editorial standards. reply kortilla 3 hours agorootparentYes, this is why hitler and Elon are basically the same… editorial standards reply steveBK123 15 hours agorootparentprevPrecisely. And each org may have slightly different biases in which training data they feed into their system! reply steveBK123 15 hours agoparentprevMy interpretation of a lot of this stuff in the popular LLMS is that the training data itself (as chosen by the org) has its own biases, and then the orgs themselves are applying their own biases via the system prompts on top. Some of those biases move in the same direction, some move in the opposite direction. Googles seemed specifically one directional. Some of this is also I think just buggy/poorly tested system prompts & guardrails that people in the Bay Area Bubble working on it don't catch themselves. That is, many of these issues are only identifiable by ideologically diverse testers. reply binary132 15 hours agorootparentHow do you suggest ideological diversity be designed? Ideological anarchy won’t be accepted. Neither will whitewashed center-party ideological conformity. The reality is that some of these ideologies are inextricably locked in mortal conflict against one another. Some of them consciously seek to undermine, subvert, or supersede one another.

It's funny when these things are really obvious. https://g.co/gemini/share/85464078bf89 reply tacomonstrous 16 hours agoparentprevI'm not seeing these responses. Edit: Interesting! If I ask about the Washington Times after I ask the question about the NYT, then it tells me freedom of speech is paramount. If I ask it to start from scratch, then I get this response. reply freedomben 16 hours agorootparentIt's also important to remember that these things can change in near real time. Someone running a query seconds later than someone else could be using a different model/code. Coupled with the general indeterminisitic nature of LLMs, it really means that not getting similar results isn't nearly the disproving that software engineers are used to. I hate it because trusting others or accepting non-reproducible things as evidence is deeply antithetical to my scientific approach to things, but it is what it is. reply digging 16 hours agorootparentIt also means that anyone can report any result at all and claim it's real, unfortunately. Without a reproducible receipt of conversation, any report of an AI conversation could be very easily faked. reply jazzyjackson 16 hours agorootparentprevit's really tragic that LLMs became normal consumer tech before public key signatures. It would be trivial for openai to sign every API response, but the interfaces we use to share text don't bother implementing verification (besides github, the superior social network) i blame zoom for acqui-sunsetting keybase. reply miki123211 15 hours agorootparentOpen AI actually solved this, you can share a link to a Chat GPT conversation and then it's trivial to verify that it's authentic. You can't fake Chat GPT output in one of these without hacking Open AI first. reply freedomben 13 hours agorootparentGood point, although how long do those links stay live? Do they get deleted after 30 days or anything? Any idea if OpenAI has ever deleted one, especially for violating content policy or something? reply solardev 16 hours agorootparentprevLLMs work surprisingly similar to our politicians: Money in, customized bullshit out. reply BryantD 16 hours agorootparentprevYep. You have to ask what order screenshots were taken in; the full context of the question is important for LLMs. This is an increasingly important piece of media literacy. reply internet101010 16 hours agorootparentPeople should be including the share urls along with the screenshots. I'm not even bothering with Gemini until they get things together but I would imagine sharing the url does not dox the person who created it. reply xienze 16 hours agorootparentprevIn this particular example, why does it matter? Shouldn't the question \"should the government ban \" always give the same answer? reply tech_ken 16 hours agorootparentLLMs don't have an internal representation of \"facts\", they generate text based entirely on the conversation history. If it's properly tuned it will remain consistent with facts it's stated earlier in the conversation, but this is just a feature of the training data demonstrating this type of consistency, the model itself doesn't understand that something being \"true\" means it's true for all time. In practice the conversation sequence strongly determines the model's internal state, so you need to preserve the entire conversation history if you're trying to demonstrate some particular model outcome. reply david-gpu 16 hours agorootparent> LLMs don't have an internal representation of \"facts\", they generate text based entirely on the conversation history. If output only depended on the conversation history, you would get the exact same output if you started ten conversations in the exact same way, and that doesn't happen. LLMs encode their knowledge in their parameters, which are fixed after training is complete and thus well before the conversation begins. The context of the conversation does also affect the output you get from the LLM, because by design they take context into account, but it is entirely untrue that the output is \"they generate text based entirely the conversation history\". reply tech_ken 15 hours agorootparentSure I guess I meant \"entirely on the conversation history\" in the sense that a prompt is a sin qua non of an outcome, and the outcome is dependent on the specific prompt(s). I was using the word informally as an emphasizer of \"conversation history\", did not intend to imply that it didn't have parameters or other internal things which effected the output, just the output at any given point in time is path-dependent on the prompts you put. reply mvdtnz 15 hours agorootparentprevHalf the people on this forum are convinced that LLMs are actually intelligent and have an actual internal world model in their \"brains\". I wonder how they square this with the fact that it will give wildly different answers to the same question with subtle changes in context. reply floren 15 hours agorootparentOh, easy: they'll say the LLMs have learned to \"code switch\" reply nonameiguess 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy always? If I ask if a person should get arrested, presumably the answer is different before and after they commit a crime. Edit: Probably never mind. I guess it's a US question where newspapers specifically have special constitutional protection. The answer still might change if the Constitution ever changes. reply glimshe 16 hours agorootparentprevI confirm seeing the responses from Twitter. reply incorrecthorse 16 hours agorootparentprevYes, once its first response is in the context window it won't contradict itself. reply Ajay-p 12 hours agoparentprevAI will never be truly AI until humans take their fingers off the scale, stop trying to manipulate it to achieve personal social and political ideals. Until then you must leave room for doubt that there is a human tipping the scales and the result is not to be trusted. reply solardev 16 hours agoparentprevFor comparison... \"Should the government ban CNN?\" > Absolutely not.

If liberal news outlets produce 10x as much content as conservative news outlets, any model trained on newsmedia would end up having a liberal bias, no? I don't know what the actual makeup of the news market is, but it seems like having 10x as much content is more valuable than having 10x the readership because LLMs are trained on volume. reply aredox 15 hours agoparentprevGemini says bad things about tabloids and your \"eyes are opened\". Meanwhile, Peter Thiel forced Gawker to actually close out of petty revenge. Open your eyes a bit more. reply bodiekane 14 hours agorootparentGawker got sued for their role in the sexual exploitation of an individual (hosting and publishing a non-consensual sex tape). Peter Thiel provided financial support for the victims of Gawker's abuse to pursue legal recourse. Many people believe his motivations for this were due to his own previous exploitation by the organization. The only dystopian thing about the Gawker case is that it took the benevolence of a rich person supporting the lawsuit to get justice. In a better system, Gawker would have been successfully sued without needing extra financial backing to pay for expensive lawyers. reply aredox 2 hours agorootparentSo tabloids like the new York Post and Washington Times should have been sued into oblivion too, first amendment be damned...

I now do most of my information searching on ChatGPT instead of Google (because Google search has become so terrible). So the impetus for getting any LLM to give unbiased results is imperative. I don't have time to go searching through primary source material and the next generation surely won't either. Of course I don't use LLMs to search for anything that is very important, nor do I blindly accept the answers, but if this is the path we're going on it's going to need bold principled leadership to oversee it. reply zoogeny 16 hours agoparentprevI think this exists outside of tech and AI as well. I was in a mall bookstore recently looking for a gift and I passed by a section of \"Philosophy\". I was curious and took a look and in that small section, a little over half a bookshelf, there was not a single title I recognized as philosophy. The closest was an abridged Art of War. The rest was entirely contemporary cultural critique stuff. I stay away from the anti-woke stuff online for the most part since I find it tedious. But I have to admit in that moment in the bookstore I realized how easy it is to erase history. No ancient Greek philosophy like Plato or Aristotle. No enlightenment philosophy. Not even existentialism. I mean, I get it that the kind of philosophy I think of is dominated by old white men. And I recognize the need to balance that out with other viewpoints. And I doubt a mall bookstore is selling a lot of copies of Spinoza or Hegel. But this was a complete erasure. This felt like the pendulum swinging so far to the other side that it has escaped reality. reply piva00 16 hours agorootparent> And I doubt a mall bookstore is selling a lot of copies of Spinoza or Hegel.

As you said: it's a mall bookstore, they have rent to pay, store inventory is expensive to keep indefinitely and they for sure aren't selling Plato's hot cakes... The erasure is caused by market forces, not by the swing of the pendulum, the market you live in doesn't value Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Aristotle, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Kant, etc. and so the bookstore you visited doesn't stock them because it won't make money. reply hintymad 13 hours agoparentprevHit really hard on me too.

We make all information accessible and useful, and the world gets better. Around that time, a lot of pressure started to mount on tech companies for their complicity in bad things; the election of Donald Trump was a pretty major catalyst. So, all the companies responded to public pressure by building algorithmic fairness organizations. But because tech companies hire from specific backgrounds and in specific locations, and aren't particularly ideologically diverse, they converged on enforcing a worldview that aligns with their morality and their concerns.

In fact, this whole article builds and then just ends, without saying anything particularly poignant. It's like a movie review that mostly recounts the plot of the movie and ends with one or two sentences about production or script. Google doesn't want to offend or be racist, which is their \"don't be evil\" directive.

Personally I would never use an LLM to try to make my mind regarding any issue that should be viewed from some moral or ethical lens. Sure, I can ask it to help with some coding stuff, write template emails and etc., but asking a question based on morality is just waste of time. Sure, let's say they aligned the question regarding pedophilia one way or another, but what do you do about questions about religion? Questions about ongoing wars that are full of emotional attachment? All the Twitter takes about freedom of press doesn't even make sense once you get out of US-centric view either, and then there are questions about enemy-state owned press.

What I'm getting into, big corps would probably be better off if all the models were limited for some sort of specific use cases (e.g. programming) rather than aiming for \"catch-all-do-all\".

If people want to have access to this kind of \"safe\" output, I don't mind, but it's my opinion that general purpose LLMs should have some semblance of neutrality in their default configuration (fully realizing that this goal is impossible to achieve with perfection) and should behave like tools that simply do what they're instructed to do, drawing from the source material without any further instructions or explicit bias. reply kredd 10 hours agorootparentYeah, fair enough.

Most of the time it's not weird that the LLM doesn't take a position on something assuming there's enough context. But this is just such a clear-cut issue that it's glaring. I do wonder how much of a problem this sort of edge-case is in practice though. Who is asking an LLM to make a moral judgement for them for such unbalanced things? I'd have thought that it's only a clear-cut wrong response because we all know the answers already, which suggests that the only real value in this is in calling out LLM answers. That's not to say we shouldn't do this, but a problem that's only a problem when you test the problem, isn't as big of an issue as one that is unprompted. reply mike_hearn 16 hours agorootparentThe reason it's getting attention is because the questions reveal an underlying extremist bias that can interfere with its ability to do basic tasks that we now expect LLMs to perform. This matters for those who deploy AI into production. Three days ago I wrote [1] that the real risk here was not Vikings with Native American headdress, it was refusals or mendacious answers to API queries that have been integrated into business processes. I gave a hypothetical example that Gemini might refuse to answer questions about a customer named Joe Masters if he worked for Whitecastle Burgers Inc. It took less than three days for that exact scenario to happen for real. A blogger usually uses ChatGPT to translate interview transcripts and titles into other languages. They thought they'd try Gemini with: Please translate the following to Spanish: InterviewThe Decline Of The West (John Smith) where John Smith was a name I didn't recognize and have forgotten. ChatGPT did it, but Gemini refused on two different grounds: 1. It recognized the name of the interviewee and felt it would be unethical to proceed because it didn't like the guy's opinions (he's a conservative). 2. It felt that the decline of the west was a talking point often associated with bad people. This is absurd and shows how frequently an app that tries to use Gemini might break. What if a key customer happens to share a name with someone who starts blogging conservative views? Your LLM based pipeline will probably just break. It looks like to ship a robust model in the LLM space you need to have an at least partially libertarian corporate culture (as Google did, when it was new), as otherwise your model will adopt the worst aspects of \"cancel culture\". In a mission critical business setting that's not going to be OK. [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39465250#39471514 reply digging 16 hours agorootparentprevThe really weird thing is that the model was almost certainly trained on a lot of data indicating that people believe Hitler is the worst person to have ever lived. Even if it was just reflecting cultural beliefs, it should be confident in saying Hitler is worse than Musk. So it appears to be intentionally trained to waffle in cases like this. reply danpalmer 16 hours agorootparentI'm not an expert on these things at all, but I wonder if it's tricky to link the mid/long form text structure to the short-form text structure, or if that's dependent on exactly how your transformers are working. In this case, the short form is very clear on the two sides at play, and pulls no punches about Hitler. I'd suggest that any reasonable person drawing a conclusion would clearly know he was worse. The issue is that at the mid length structure it's chosen to use a two-sides discussion without a clear conclusion. That's a good call for many discussions, if not most, but the piece that feels like it's missing is the link between the short-form and this level, which would influence it to structure the response in a much clearer way with a conclusion. reply michaelt 16 hours agorootparent> I'd suggest that any reasonable person drawing a conclusion would clearly know he was worse. And yet, despite the fact any reasonable person would draw that incredibly obvious conclusion, the model isn't able to. reply digging 14 hours agorootparentprev> I'd suggest that any reasonable person drawing a conclusion would clearly know he was worse. You can't base any assumption on the existence of a reasonable person without defining \"reasonable\" very specifically - we all reason in a social context and defer to norms whenever possible. We all know Hitler was the worst because we keep telling each other Hitler was the worst. He wasn't responsible for the most deaths, he wasn't the meanest or cruelest person ever, etc. If/when people stop teaching about Hitler as \"He was the worst,\" people will stop learning that he was the worst. Or they might learn nothing about him, like how in my US education we learned next-to-nothing about Stalin and many people I know are pretty ambiguous about the ethics of being Stalin. And so then when a stupid LLM tries to draw a comparison between Hitler and anyone else who isn't an architect of genocide, and puts those 2 people in the same context, and doesn't say \"genocide is way fucking worse than grifting\", we lose some of that cultural context that tells us genocide is way fucking worse than grifting. reply Veuxdo 16 hours agoparentprevI think there's an easy solution: don't ask computers things.

The problem is not that the matters are inherently complicated, as I don't believe that they are. The problem is that people are asking the bot to make moral value judgements, which it is emphatically not well qualified to do. It should merely support humans in making their own value judgments. reply pornel 16 hours agorootparentYou're making a mistake of assuming that answers that are obviously true and moral to you are neutral and objective. \"Who's evil?\" or \"What should be illegal?\" are inherently judgemental. For some answers the overwhelming majority will agree, but that still doesn't make them neutral and somehow outside of morality, but only aligned with the prevailing ideology. Subtler questions like free speech vs limits on lies or hate speech don't have universal agreement, especially outside of US. Training of models unfortunately isn't as simple as feeding them just a table of the true_objective_neutral_facts_that_everyone_agrees_on.csv. \"Alignment\" of models is trying to match what the majority of people think is right.

Questions with explicit facts like “show me the founding fathers of the United States” that were all known actual people showing up with wildly different looks is one failure mode of these systems but I keep seeing commentators in this post bring up questions that do not have a “correct” answer without looking through a specific moral viewpoint, and getting bent out of shape that the model is responding with an answer through their own personal lens Edit: I should read a whole comment before responding, I just restated what you meant.

AV space) that I feel like this is more of a cultural war issue than an actual technology concern. reply MBCook 15 hours agorootparentI don’t think Ben was trying to say it’s a cultural agenda thing. It’s clear to me he wants to avoid that third rail for his point. I think he spelled it out well on his subscription only podcast Dithering with John Gruber. They were afraid of being criticized for only white men when you asked for a picture of a CEO (likely based on input data) or a woman for a nurse or some other traditionally stereotypical profession. So they seem to have put in something to ensure diversity to try to correct for bias in the input data. That seems good to me. But they overcorrected in a way it just wouldn’t show you white people. Turns out the Nazis and founding fathers were more diverse than I was taught. Oops. But worse, and the big problem Ben pointed out, was there was no way this wasn’t known internally. And the company culture seems to be at a point where either you can’t speak up or it’s ignored because diversity is good even if it’s at the cost of all accuracy on easily verifiable facts. And that’s a problem. They avoided the culture war so hard out of fear they crammed themselves back into the culture war and it blew up in their face. It was an unforced error that they must have seen coming. So this whole incident seems very indicative of a culture/management problem inside Google. reply tech_ken 15 hours agorootparentHm okay fair enough, I'll check out the podcast I do think that's a better format for communicating some of the details of this type of criticism. > It was an unforced error that they must have seen coming. To some extent this feels like something that's happening a lot in tech across the board, not just in 'culture war' type issues but across several other fronts (the various Metaverse flops, for example). I do think this indicates an overabundance of groupthink, but part of me wonders if its just a consequence of these companies becoming so big and working on so many fronts that it's basically impossible for them to avoid stepping on every rake. Still, they did seem like they genuinely wanted this to take off so concerning that couldn't be prepared for even this basic failure mode (which is already a pretty well-trod problem space). reply MBCook 14 hours agorootparentI agree.

If you're going to be offended at an LLM refusing to take a position on \"is X worse than Y?\", then just imagine how offended you'd be if the LLM did take positions on such things! I know it's hard to keep in mind that an LLM is an LLM, but if you forget, then you'll end up saying stupid shit like the author and so many other people do here. It's like if your dog bites the mailman and not the UPS driver, then you start stressing out about why your dog is anti-government, and post a notice saying \"Warning: dog on site. If you are employed by a private organization, then you have no need to worry, but if you are a government employee, you may want to leave the package outside the gate.\" My rule of thumb is to prefix any LLM response with \"A plausible-sounding answer to that question is:\". Because that's exactly what these things do. Yes, they can be biased one way or the other, based both on the training data as well as RLHF etc, but that's really not the core problem here. LLMs are not people. They do not hold consistent positions on things, and don't even try to, no matter how much post-processing happens after the LLM does its thing. A duck makes duck noises. Don't get mad at it if it quacks in a way that turns out to be a deadly insult to a pig.

We'd better ban bags of tiles that contain a lot of E's, they're way too woke! LLMs are not people. They do not compute opinions. They do not weigh the harms of A vs B and reason out an answer, even though they (frequently!) produce responses word for word identical to someone doing exactly that. They are designed and programmed to produce responses that appear to be coming from reasoning humans, because they arise out of human-reasoned input and their various tunings and reinforcement learnings and things are adjusted to sound plausible—a word which here means \"appearing to have come from a reasoning human\". Perhaps the problem is that we cut & paste just the text of LLMs' output.

LLMs give wrong answers to questions all the time, because they don't have the ability to actually internally reason. Whatever your moral platform, even simple ethical principles require a couple stages of basic induction (\"X is wrong, Person A does more X than Person B => Person B is worse than Person A\"). Getting an LLM to flawless and unobjectionably execute moral syllogisms of this type is really, really tough, even if you accept a basic axiomatic view of morality. Hitler vs Elon is an obvious case that people are waving around because it looks bad, but to me it seems far more reasonable to make an MVP which refuses to address moral issues entirely, rather than improperly execute a weird edge case where training data is sparse or even biased (ex. \"is Narendra Modi worse than than Xi Jinping\"). reply mvdtnz 15 hours agorootparentInteresting that you think it's better to say Hitler was no worse than a guy tweeting than to make a moral judgment against Hitler.

As I said above, it's not a question of the existence of moral truths, it's a question of getting the LLM to execute syllogisms consistently in a context that people are very touchy about (as you so helpfully demonstrate over and over again). If you're expecting LLMs to be universal truth generators I think you will be disappointed for a very long time. If you want LLMs to demonstrate perfect moral clarity likewise.

Gemini is an LLM and LLM's are new and they hallucinate and make up nonexistent court cases and nonexistent books and everything else. Trying to judge whether it can give a morally correct answer to whether Elon Musk or Hitler negatively impacted society more is ludicrous. It doesn't always get facts right -- why do you think it would get some sort of moral opinion like this \"right\"? Especially if it's being trained on Reddit which probably has lots of edgelords claiming that Elon is the worse one or something. Google is between a rock and a hard place here. When they give it prompts to prevent it from saying objectionable things it gets criticized for being morally wishy-washy, like here. But without the safety mechanisms, the press will be all over it when people get it to spew racism, fascism, and what else have you. And the idea that this is coming from Google's \"culture\" seems like a scapegoat to me, and totally unsupported. I think it's clear that Google is attempting some kind of middle ground here that tries to minimize overall offensiveness, that LLM's are going to do a pretty bad job at this because they're not advanced enough to do a good job, and that their unsatisfactory answers are always going to be paraded around in blog posts by somebody. And whatever you think of Google's culture, I don't think that has anything to do with it one way or another. This is simply the risk minimization that any large corporation applies to their products. The idea that this is a failure of Google culture, or of Sundar specifically, seems absurd.

It is generative AI, creating something new and random, every time. It is generally an input to a creative endeavor, not basic research. Unfortunately if you really want to know what a Viking looked like you're going to have to do some actual research. It's wild to me that people expect something that can generate an image of a penguin roller-skating on a loaf of bread shredding on a guitar to generate a historically accurate image of a Viking or whatever. These two problems are very different. The text interface, also not a search engine. And it is definitely not a *truth engine*, which is what people like Musk expect Grok to be. It's not capable of that level of reason or understanding. Other commenters have brought up that asking it any type of question like is X worse than Hitler, whether that X is Biden or Trump or anybody else, it's going to respond \"it's hard to say.\" It's being tuned to not pass value judgements at all, because that is not what LLMs are for. It's never going to be your truth engine. If you think these things are thinking, or that they have values, you've been duped. As a side note, I think all the big companies are making the same mistake of trying to get a generalized model for all queries, or with the layer that directs them to a specific tuned model.

Unfortunately, while humans can at least try to distinguish between \"picture of a multiracial couple\" and \"picture of a multiracial Viking\"; or between \"right wing views\" and \"actual fascism\"; that is probably much harder for AI. Because in AI it's all continuous, right? Underneath, there's no binary which could represent \"is racist vs isn't\"; there's just a continuous \"how racist is X\" where Republicans in general are a bit racist and Trump is more racist and Hitler is very racist. So then, when you tell it \"don't endorse Der Stürmer\" it will also, a little bit, not endorse the New York Post.

If you ask it whether President Lula caused more damage to humanity than Stalin, it says \"it's important to examine historical figures in context, considering complexities and avoiding simplistic comparisons.\" This is not leftist bias, it's an LLM that's been tuned not to make those comparisons at all.

Gave me a good chuckle reply m3kw9 16 hours agoprevThe level of wokeness of Gemini is complete incompetence by the test team reply iteratethis 11 hours agoprevGoogle is full of contradictions. They do all of this for the sake of diversity yet it's the least diverse place imaginable as it represents a narrow brand of politics only (largely) found in California. Which is a laughable set of politics as most of its members (activists) as well as its host (Google) are in fact ultra capitalistic neoconservatives in their actual doing. It's the total opposite of diversity and inclusion as its optical only. reply pb7 13 hours agoprevGut the entire leadership including Sundar Pichai.

Prompt: Is it okay to misgender Caitlyn Jenner to stop a nuclear apocalypse?

I was thinking this same thing before I got to this passage in the article. The most bizarre thing about the Gemini fiasco is that the base models, the OSS models of Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B, are damned impressive. Gemma-2B alone surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo IME. What’s happening here is that an army of bullshit jobs, really departments of bullshit jobs, are leading to a negative impact on product. Silicon Valley has become too soft as of late, the layoffs need to become more aggressive to remove these bullshit jobs from mucking up the product. reply thepasswordis 15 hours agoprev [–] I use chatGPT every single day. I use it more often than google search, and google search at this point is just a frontend for reddit for me. Can anybody say anything even remotely similar about gemini? Would you even consider using gemini for searching anything after realizing that a core feature of it seems to be distorting reality and lying to you? Google has burned a ton of goodwill with this garbage. How long until this type of AI is being used for moderation on youtube? Will I be allowed to send emails to other people without a warning after an LLM decides the content of the email is problematic? This might seem far fetched, but ask gemini some uncomfortable questions, and look at how it responds, and it won't seem so far off anymore. Downthread I gave an example of asking it which parks in Palo Alto have the least violent drug addicts or homeless encampments, and it not only refuses to respond, but it scolds me for even asking the question. Finding and correlating information like that is *exactly* the type of thing that AI should be good at. reply temporarara 14 hours agoparent [–] From the memes it seems gemini is great for creating racist memes, but since I ain't got no time for that I will probably never use it. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
