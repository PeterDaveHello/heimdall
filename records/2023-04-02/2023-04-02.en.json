Launched in 2014, these voice assistants were used to interact with amazon's services, answer questions and stream music. As time went on the devices grew in popularity; as of 2023 they account for 21.7% of global smart speaker purchases. There have been several notable attempts to run custom software on echo devices, such as this project, however they have proven to be relatively secure. With so many devices in use, a weaponised echo device could be a very dangerous tool, allowing eavesdropping on sensitive conversation and giving false resonses, or in this case, extracting sensitive information such as wifi passwords. More modern devices from the company run fireOS, Amazon's modified version of Android, on a MediaTek CPU. This is interesting, as it means both the hardware and software are similar to that found on Amazon Fire tablets. I have been experimenting with an echo dot 2nd generation, which uses a MT8163 processor found in the HD 8 from 2018. This fire tablet was rooted using an exploit known as amonet, which means it was possible to port this exploit to the echo. \n                \nExploiting the processor: you can too!\n\n                After a few minor modifications, I managed to make the main amonet script dump the contents of the storage(eMMC flash memory). The modified version can be found here, and a graphical version is available here.  The memory can be dumped when the device is in bootrom mode, which can be forced by placing a piece of tin foil to short the capacitor shown below to the RF shield, which temporarily prevents it from being able to boot. For a detailed disassembly guide please check ifixit.\n                \n\n\n\n                Once I had the filesystem, I began to analyse its contents, and what I found was very interesting. It seemed to use a tool called wpa_supplicant to manage its wireless connections, which is not uncommon on older android versions. When using this tool, it is good practice to hash the password for the wireless network before storing it in the configuration file (encrypt it in a way that cannot be reversed). This can be done with one simple command (wpa_passphrase), however, amazon's internal team lab126 (who develops their consumer hardware), chose not to use this. It may not seem like a significant decision, however when you consider that anyone with physical access to an amazon device using this vulnerable processor (it is also used by multiple echo show devices) can extract network passwords with relative ease. \n                \nWhat does this mean?\n\n                Storing passwords in plain text is a major security risk in hotels or businesses using the devices on their internal or private wireless networks, giving any potential attackers access to any other equipment on this network or allowing them to create a rogue network and redirect traffic or conduct a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack. It may also breach the Data Protection Act which states customer data must be 'handled in a way that ensures appropriate security'. Hashing passwords is an industry standard, and for a company that has sold their hardware to millions, it is completely unacceptable to not encrypt this data.  But it gets even worse. A plain-text configuration file located in /system/etc includes API keys for spotify zeroconf and eSDK APIs, if accessed these could allow anybody to play audio from the device and potentially send audio to fake a notification or alert. \n                \nModifications\n\n                  As for booting modified software, it is difficult but not impossible. Unfortunately, I bricked my echo by carelessly flashing the wrong file, but not before finding some useful information. All mediatek devices use something called a preloader. It is essentially a loader for the bootloader, a very low level piece of software that runs on the cpu each boot. If anybody successfully patches the preloader to bypass checks of the mediatek 'little kernel' (lk) and 'unlock_code', we can write zeros to the start of the preloader and boot from the patched version. However, this would mean using a computer every time you boot your echo. As the device runs fireOS, the command fastboot oem flags fos_flags:0x80 should work to disable dm-verity, which is used to verify the integrity of android images and allow us to run unsigned code. This would be very serious as it would allow devices to be modified to send data to an attacker instead of amazon. \n                \nConclusion\n\n                  In summary, whilst some aspects of the echo dot are very secure they are not immune to tampering and modification, and demonstrate an extreme lack of security when it comes to password storage. When designing embedded hardware, it is essential to consider physical security, and I hope that we can bring this issue to Amazon's attention and find a permenant solution to prevent any security breaches.\n                \nEDIT (1.4.2023): Above, I stated that hashing passwords was an industry standard. As others have pointed out, whilst it is good practice, not all devices implement it. Also, the hashes can be used to connect to a network just like a plain text password, so hashing the wpa key is not a solution. Perhaps encrypting the passwords in a proprietary format would be acceptable, but even then it is decryptable.\n                \n\n\n\n\n\nContact Me\n          \u2022\n          Github\n\n\n\n\n['A very inspiring thing about this article was the bio: &quot;Hi there! I am Daniel, a 14 year old developer whose interests include cybersecurity and hardware hacking, low level hardware, web design, and linux.&quot;<p>I look forward to seeing what you do 10 years from now. Keep it up!', '&gt;  When using this tool, it is good practice to hash the password for the wireless network before storing it in the configuration file (encrypt it in a way that cannot be reversed). This can be done with one simple command (wpa_passphrase),<p>Huh? Anyone who has that hash can still connect to your Wi-Fi network, which kind of defeats what is being claimed.  At that point you can also bruteforce the plaintext password (offline, at your leisure), or worse...', 'Meh, the PSK can be used to connect to the network. The &quot;cleartext&quot; really does not matter unless you reuse passwords, which you shouldn&#x27;t do.<p>Anyone with physical access to your Echo probably has a dozen other methods to get access to your password.<p>Now dumping this is still quite impressive for 14 year old. Kudos.', 'Is this that big of a deal? Surely by the time someone has hardware access, the game is over. The keys need to be decrypted into memory to use them, and nothing stops someone with hardware access from dumping that memory. No amount of encryption beats a soldering iron.', 'Eh. It&#x27;s certainly not great practice though not stunning given how utter crap 99% of IOT WiFi seems to be. That said the author gets a bit overdone, and not just in brushing over the physical access requirement bit.<p>&gt;<i>Storing passwords in plain text is a major security risk in hotels or businesses using the devices on their internal or private wireless networks, giving any potential attackers access to any other equipment on this network or allowing them to create a rogue network and redirect traffic or conduct a MITM (man-in-the-middle) attack.</i><p>Nah, unless it&#x27;s a truly awful network even for a prosumer let alone any organization. Even with IOT, ever more widespread PPSK support (which I&#x27;d consider a must have for anything greenfield at this point) makes segmenting devices onto their own tightly firewalled VLANs trivial. Normal user interactive devices (computers, smartphones, tablets etc) should all be using VPNs for internal access and just not trust the WiFi at all, or at the least again have their own VLANs. These devices should all support WPA-EAP as well so that&#x27;s another option, and can just use certs and do away with passwords entirely. If IOT wasn&#x27;t such crap that&#x27;d be an option there too but such is life.<p>It would be fair to say this is all still more complex then it should be, all the tech pieces are in place to make this vastly easier even for the non-technical, the UX is poor in a bunch of respects. And I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of small businesses who just run flat networks, maybe with a guest wifi. But that&#x27;s an issue <i>anyway</i>, and I don&#x27;t think someone physically stealing an Echo and dumping its eMMC to get at their WiFi password is floor level on their threat model. More like &quot;the desk machine has a password of abc123 and is left unlocked while the elderly B&amp;B lady goes and makes breakfast for guests&quot; and frankly who is breaking in looking for that anyway? It&#x27;s egg on Amazon&#x27;s face for sure, absolutely embarrassing for a company of that size and product line that big, and that it&#x27;s exposed in plaintext on the fs might chain a remote exploit in interesting ways, but not if physical access is required. And again, organizations actually facing threats really just shouldn&#x27;t be trusting WiFi much anyway. It&#x27;s not that secure even in theory and implementations are a mess and probably always will be.', '&gt; When using this tool, it is good practice to hash the password for the wireless network before storing it in the configuration file (encrypt it in a way that cannot be reversed).<p>This is bullshit. The device ultimately needs the wifi passcode in plaintext. What this person is asking for is obfuscation and cryptography theater, not real security.<p>Of course if you root the device you can read the wifi passcode. This is not shocking.', 'This isn&#x27;t particularly interesting, though the steps to get access are nicely done.<p>Most devices of that era including many Android phones lacked any sort of secure enclave for tamper proof secret storage or encryption. I believe the early Echo stored the wifi password using a weak block cipher and a fixed key, like Kindles. Given the password needs to be eventually decrypted in software, any sort of encryption like this is effectively obfuscation. Physical access is far, far worse!<p>I think folks forget how much security innovation there has been, and become accessible to consumers, in the last decade. It wasn&#x27;t too long ago that SSL was considered a luxury.', 'So the idea of shorting that capacitor\u2026 how did you reason that doing that would keep that chip from starting?', 'Not to diminish the effort (I love seeing these things cracked): if you have physical access to an Alexa device you likely have access to the router as well.<p>The better coarse of action for a wrongdoer would be to get everything off the router using a serial interface and leave no traces behind for an extended remote access.', 'So the attack vector is: you need to flash a device in a certain place. That means, you need to open the device and do other things.<p>Honestly, who has an Amazon Echo dot on a private network in a public place?<p>Yes, it is a valid attack vector but I would vote the likelyness and importance at very very low risk.']",

Google apparently decided to put a hard limit on the number of files you're allowed to have on one Google Drive account. Google rolled out this file limit without warning anyone it would happen. Users over the limit found themselves suddenly locked out of new file uploads, and it was up to them to figure out what was going wrong.\nDid we mention this all started in February? A post on the Google Drive API issue tracker shows some users have been seeing this error for almost two months now. The original message said: \"The limit for the number of items, whether trashed or not, created by this account has been exceeded.\" And sometime in March, it was updated to say, \"Error 403: This account has exceeded the creation limit of 5 million items. To create more items, move items to the trash and delete them forever.\" Since there is nothing anywhere that informs users Google Drive has a file limit, users originally thought this was a bug and asked Google to quickly fix it. It has been two months now, though, and Google has not issued a public response. Some users say they have gotten Google Support to privately confirm the limit is intended, and a pop-up message is starting to show up in the Drive UI for some users.\nIt might be understandable to limit a data hog abusing a free account, but that's not what's happening here. Google is selling this storage to users, via both the Google Workspace business accounts and the consumer-grade Google One storage plans. Google One tops out at 30TB of storage, which costs an incredible $150 a month to use. Google Workspace's formal plans cap out at 5TB, but an \"Enterprise\" plan promises \"As much storage as you need.\" From what we can tell in the various comments on Reddit and the issue tracker, both consumer and business account types are subject to this hidden 5 million file limit. \nAdvertisement \n\n\nGoogle Drive has a file-sharing limit of 400,000 files, but that's easy to work around by just unsharing files\u2014you don't have to delete anything. This limit is also thoroughly documented in Google's support articles. The 5 million total file cap isn't documented anywhere, and remember, it has been two months since this rolled out. It's not listed on the Google One or Google Workspace plan pages, and we haven't seen any support documents about it. Google also doesn't have any tools to see if you're getting close to this file limit\u2014there's no count of files anywhere. We've emailed Google a ton of questions and will update this if we hear back.\nFive million 4KB files would take up 20GB of storage, so that file limit is nowhere near enough for Google customers to use the storage they are actually buying. You could very easily store billions of files in 30TB of space. Even if Google is going to somehow argue this limit is acceptable, it's inexcusable to make this a surprise\u00a0for paying customers. Google knows the right way to do this: you email everyone, you make a blog post, and you post a pop-up warning message in the Drive UI, and you do this all months ahead of actually rolling out the change. Especially for Workspace business customers, which are supposed to be paying for a more stable version of Google's services with a slow rollout, a surprise change is just baffling.\n(Update, 5:57 pm: A Google spokesperson confirmed to Ars that the file limit isn't a bug, calling the 5 million file cap \"a safeguard to prevent misuse of our system in a way that might impact the stability and safety of the system.\" The company clarified that the limit applies to \"how many items one user can create in any Drive,\" not a total cap for all files in a drive. For individual users, that's not a distinction that matters, but it could matter if you share storage with several accounts.\nGoogle added, \"This limit does not impact the vast majority of our users' ability to use their Google storage.\" and \"In practice, the number of impacted users here is vanishingly small.\")\n[/ars_sidebar]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreader comments\n206\n with \n\n\nShare this story\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRon Amadeo\n      Ron is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

        "content": "In distributed systems, logical clocks are crucial in ordering system events, but conventional clocks can't reliably compare timestamps due to clock drift and network delay. Distributed logical clocks are designed to produce reliable timestamps and can function across multiple nodes. Various logical clock designs implement a 'history' component as a compaction scheme, with Lamport clocks providing strictly increasing numbers in any given node. However, Lamport clocks cannot determine a total order of events or distinguish concurrent events. The Lamport Origin Clock addresses the former, while vector clocks track the id of a node and the last known event id from that node, allowing for a comparison of concurrent events.Dotted Vector Clock optimizes timestamp checks, tracks latest events separately, and can determine event precedence without further checks. Vector timestamps carry a superset of information compared to Lamport origin timestamps, allowing for ordering of events across nodes and based on history. Version vectors use vector clocks to track versions of stored data, useful for multi-leader storage nodes. Lamport Causal Clock captures causality explicitly and has space complexity O(1), but requires O(log m) time complexity for event comparison. Total Order requires events to be ordered sequentially based on temporal and causal relationships, with concurrent events ordered the same way by different nodes.The article discusses various designs for logical clocks used in distributed systems to achieve event ordering. Lamport Clock and Lamport Origin Clock are not preferred as they only enable ordering after the fact. Vector Clock and Lamport Causal Clock can achieve total ordering after the fact or in real-time barring concurrent events, with LCC being slower in practice but more space-efficient. The article then explains the importance of total ordering in collaborative-editing applications. The author provides an insightful guide on various logical clocks used in distributed systems and the trade-offs when choosing one design over the others.Microsoft Azure Time Sync designated PTP while AWS and Google Cloud sync use NTP. The discussion assumes 17th-century Newton's physics, although Einstein proved time is not absolute. The attempts made to consider time as an absolute falls apart at a specific resolution due to the speed of information. A mental model of the universe that is not consistent with the way the universe works is applied to most endeavors. There is no strict ordering of events in financial transactions, but banks handle this better with extra charges for negative balances.",
        "summary": "Logical clocks are essential in ordering events in distributed systems, with Lamport and vector clocks being popular designs. Lamport clocks provide increasing numbers within a node, while vector clocks track node IDs and respective event IDs for concurrent event comparisons. Dotted Vector Clock and Vector Timestamps optimize timestamp checks and allow for event ordering across nodes. Version vectors track data versions in multi-leader storage nodes. Lamport Causal Clock captures causality but requires more space and time complexity. Total Order requires sequential ordering based on temporal and causal relationships. Logical clocks are crucial in collaborative editing applications. Azure Time Sync uses PTP, while AWS and Google Cloud use NTP. The article notes the limitations of trying to consider time as absolute and highlights the importance of event ordering in banking transactions.",

        "content": "\n\n\n\n\nMoving from Rust to C++ | Raph Levien\u2019s blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaph Levien\u2019s blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoving from Rust to C++\n\nApr 1, 2023\n      \n\n\nI\u2019ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.\nChoice of build systems\nOne of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.\nIn C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there\u2019s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it\u2019s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.\nWe haven\u2019t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.\nSafety\nProbably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.\nFirst, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I\u2019ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I\u2019ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.\nSecond, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it\u2019s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it\u2019s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we\u2019ll just fix those as they surface.\nThird, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they\u2019re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.\nLanguage evolution\nOne notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I\u2019m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.\nBy comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming \u201ctype alias impl trait\u201d is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.\nC++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.\nFortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup\u2019s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.\nCommunity\nI\u2019ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.\nThe Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.\nConclusion\nRust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.\nWe\u2019re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite.

We\u2019ve heard your feedback on common challenges posed by the migration, specifically the service worker\u2019s inability to use DOM capabilities and the current hard limit on extension service worker lifetimes. We\u2019re mitigating the former with the Offscreen Documents API (added in Chrome 109) and are actively pursuing a solution to the latter.We\u2019re committed to providing developers solutions to migration challenges with new functionality, bug fixes, and adequate time for adoption. For this reason, we\u2019re postponing any January experiments to turn off Manifest V2 in pre-release channels of Chrome and changes to the featured badge in the Chrome Webstore, and we'll be evaluating all downstream milestones as well. Expect to hear more about the updated phase-out plan and schedule by March of 2023. Our guiding principle will be to give developers sufficient time to update and test their extensions after the launch of these new capabilities before turning off Manifest V2.Thank you for all the feedback and passionate discussion thus far, and we wish you a happy start to 2023.Simeon - @dotprotoChrome Extensions DevRelOliver Dunkunread,Mar 29, 2023, 10:44:50\u202fAM\u00a0(3 days ago)\u00a0Mar 29\ue83a\ue15f\ue5d4Reply to authorSign in to reply to authorForwardSign in to forwardDeleteYou do not have permission to delete messages in this groupLinkReport message as abuseSign in to report message as abuseShow original messageEither email addresses are anonymous for this group or you need the view member email addresses permission to view the original messageto Chromium Extensions, Simeon VincentHey everyone,As promised, we wanted to share an update on how things are going. Over the last few months, we\u2019ve made progress on a number of improvements based on developer community feedback, such as allowing extension events to\u00a0extend a service worker\u2019s lifetime,\u00a0increasing in-memory session storage\u00a0from 1 MB to 10 MB\u00a0after cross-browser discussions, and adding more reasons for\u00a0offscreen documents. We're\u00a0continuing to improve\u00a0the platform by making service workers easier to use (including more flexible lifetimes with messaging and other APIs), introducing more service worker APIs in general, and working with other browser vendors to find ways we can align our extension platforms. \u00a0We plan to continue reviewing feedback, making changes and improving documentation to ensure the transition from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3 is smooth and successful. We're still working on the timeline of the MV2 phase-out plan, so keep an eye out for it in the coming months. We will provide sufficient migration time for developers - at least 6 months of heads-up - before beginning any experiments to turn off MV2 in the browser next year.We remain committed to the rollout of MV3 to improve security, privacy, and performance for our users around the world. We also want to ensure that we phase out MV2 in a timely manner, and we\u2019re continuing to listen to feedback from the developer community to help inform our improvements and timelines.Thanks for your patience while we continue to work on moving the extensions ecosystem forward in a way that supports the needs of users and developers.Chrome Extensions Team\ue5d3\ue15fReply all\ue15eReply to author\ue154ForwardThis conversation is lockedYou cannot reply and perform actions on locked conversations.\ue5d50 new messages\ue5cdSearchClear searchClose searchGoogle appsMain menu['&gt; As we head towards Manifest V3 migration, we are intently monitoring comments from the developer community to help inform our timelines.<p>Here&#x27;s some feedback:<p>If uBlock Origin loses full control over what gets loaded and what not, I will immediately uninstall Chrome from all my and my family&#x27;s devices and switch back to Firefox, after a decade of using Chrome as the main browser.

While a launch is not imminent this week, it could take place as early as April 10, sources said.\nEarlier this week, the company lifted the massive \"Super Heavy\" first stage of its launch system onto a launch mount at the pad. The next step will involve lifting the Starship upper stage into place, atop the first stage. While these vehicles have been previously stacked for testing, this should be the final time they are positioned on the launch pad before lifting off.\nIn recent weeks technicians have added shielding to protect the launch mount and tower from the extreme heating from the launch of Super Heavy, which is powered by 33 Raptor engines. The launch vehicle will have about double the thrust of the two most powerful rockets ever to reach orbit, NASA's Saturn V and Space Launch System rockets.\nWith this work largely completed, the focus now turns toward the final significant hurdle standing between SpaceX's massive rocket and a launch attempt\u2014a license from the Federal Aviation Administration. While such regulatory matters are uncertain, a source said good progress is being made toward the issuance of such a license during the first two weeks of April.\nIt also appears that, tentatively, NASA is reserving the use of its high-altitude WB-57 aircraft for observations of the Starship test flight on April 10 and 11. The agency is closely tracking SpaceX's progress with the massive rocket, as it intends to use the Starship vehicle as a lunar lander for its astronauts as part of the Artemis Moon missions. \nAdvertisement \n\n\nA long time coming\nSpaceX previously completed a hot fire test of the Super Heavy first stage in early February. At the time, 31 of the rocket's 33 engines ignited and burned as intended. SpaceX determined that its engineers had obtained enough data from the test to proceed toward a launch attempt. After that the booster and upper stage were removed to facilitate work on the launch mount.\nAfter it launches, the Super Heavy rocket will fly from SpaceX's Starbase launch site eastward, over the Gulf of Mexico. For this test, the booster will not attempt a landing. After stage separation, the Starship upper vehicle is intended to reach orbital velocity before attempting a reentry into Earth's atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean. If all goes well, it will make a controlled descent and landing into the ocean just north of the Hawaiian islands.\nAfter a rapid-fire test campaign in 2020 and 2021 of launching Starship prototypes, the company has moved more cautiously at its development and test facility in South Texas. This is because the company has likely invested more than $1 billion in a massive launch-and-catch tower to support Starship and Super Heavy, as well as ground systems to support fueling of the massive vehicles.\nBecause so many assets are clustered in a small area near the Gulf of Mexico, SpaceX really does not want to take the risk of destroying infrastructure it has spent more than a year building and testing. This would set the Starship launch campaign back months, at least, as the area is rebuilt. It would also probably redouble regulatory concerns that were raised as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's process to clear the South Texas location for experimental orbital launches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreader comments\n107\n with \n\n\nShare this story\n\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Berger\n      Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA, and author of the book Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX.
